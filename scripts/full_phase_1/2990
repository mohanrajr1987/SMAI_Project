Positive 2990 pEntity A has a table TA ID int PK autoinc, f1, f2, f3.p  pUsing JPA over Hibernate, we save a record to A. The ID field is marked as the Key. We have set the batch size to 100 hoping that after 100 records are saved to the repository, physical INSERTs will be invoked. However, JPAHibernate apparently INSERTs each record as soon as the persist is called, possibly because it has to set the value of the key field which it can only get from the DB. p  pThis means when we have a PK which is autoincrement, it will not be possible to perform the DB operations in a batch Am I missing some annotationconfiguration that can let me still perform the inserts in a batch p  pI do not need the entity to be managed after inserting the records.p  pThanks,p  pYashp

Positive 2990 pIm doing some research on how to use VaadinJPAEclipseLinkPostreSQL for the development of a web application for sharing pictures and how well is this combination suited for this purpose. Im struggling with the decision on the management of user contacts. I will go into further detail on this after I explain the structure of my tablesp  pstrongUsers tablestrongp  pThe users table consists of the following columnsp  ul listrongUser IDstrong  automatically generated upon registration uniqueli listrongUsernamestrong  the name of the user defined upon registration uniqueli listrongPasswordstrong  the password of the user defined upon registrationli listrongUploadsstrong  all the IDs of images that the user has uploaded. I will not go into detail here because this doesnt concern my problem. Suffice to say that this column is used together with another table called strongImagesstrong for managing the gallery of the current userli ul  pstrongContacts tablestrongp  pThis table is purely for storing relation information between the users a colleague of mine decided to do that, which I frankly dont like but its already done.... It has only two columnsp  ul listrongUser IDstrong  the users ID who has the contacts see belowli lipstrongContactsstrong  stores all user IDs that the user with strongUser IDstrong has given permission to to view his image gallery.p  pstrongNotestrong this is strongnotstrong a bidirectional relation. This means that when user X adds user Y to his contacts, user X grants access to his strongownstrong image gallery to user Y. However this does not make user Ys gallery visible to user X. This can only happen if user Y also adds user X to his contacts. And image can be either public or private. Public images can be viewed by all users however the private ones can be viewed only by the user who owns those and all others whom the owner has granted access to by adding them to his contacts. Private might not be the best term here so you might view it as allow friends to view it kind of thing.pli ul  pWhenever I delete a user I have to do the followingp  ol liDelete all image files uploaded by the user  an image in the strongImagesstrong table has a single uploader. The viewing status  its totally safe to simply delete the file and remove its entry from the strongImagesstrong table since each image is bound to its uploader and noone else affected strongImagesstrong table, storageli liDelete the users folder  sadly the way Java works you have to first make sure a folder is empty before you delete it affected storageli liDelete user from all contacts lists of all users  strongTHIS HEREstrong is the main dilemma Im having affected strongUsersstrong tableli liDelete the user himself affected strongUsersstrong tableli ol  pBecause of the queries Ive written so far this order is basically how it is supposed to be. I find it to be the optimal considering the relations between my tables.p  pAs Ive mentioned in point strong3strong I have quite the dilemma on how to do this with as less effort coding and performancewise as possible. Im looking into two solutions for thisp  ul lipstrongUnidirectional relationstrong  dont change the strongUsersstrong table and simply travers all users in it and then traverse the contacts of each user looking for the user ID of the current user that I want to deletepli lipstrongBidirectional relationstrong  add a new column to strongUsersstrong called strongaddedBystrong that stores all user IDs of users who have added the current user that I want to delete to their contacts. Every time user X adds another user to his contacts, that other user adds user X to his strongaddedBystrong list but not strongcontactsstrong.pli ul  pThe problem Im seeing in the strongunidirectional relationstrong is exactly the fact that I have to traverse through all users and then check the contacts of each to see whether it contains the user ID I want to remove.p  pThe problem Im seeing in the strongbidirectional relationstrong is the overhead that is added with the new column. The big plus here however is that I can skip looking into the contacts of all users of course worst case here is when the user has been added to the contacts of all users which omho is not likely to happen  and do that only for those who are in the strongaddedBystrong list.p  pIm far from a database expert and as you might have noticed from the written above there is probably a much better way of doing things. However Im interested in only the two versions Ive mentioned above and with as few changes to the DB as possible. Also I dont know which query would be easier to write. I have managed to do all the other steps 1,2 and 4 from the deletion process but number 3 is a tough one.p  pAny idea which one would be better Number of users is not important since this is done purely for research however a couple of hundredsthousands entries in the strongUsersstrong table should make things more realistic.p
Positive 2990 pI am having trouble getting my head around optimistic locking. The framework I am using is Play 1.2.5.p  pSay I am selling concert tickets. I currently have the followingp  precodeif concert.ticketsSold lt concert.tickets      concert.ticketsSold      concert.save  codepre  pHowever, when several people book at the same time, the ticketsSold counter lags behind the real sold value. Eg it will say 2500 when i fact I sold 2700.p  pThis is when I started reading about strongOptimisticLockExceptionstrong. In all the examples I found on the interweb, people tend to catch the OptimisticLockException, and show an error to the user.p  pWhat I want, is for the system to strongretry a certain number of timesstrong, before showing the user an error. The code I wrote is as followsp  precodeboolean saved  false int tries  0 while saved      try          if concert.ticketsSold lt concert.tickets              concert.ticketsSold              concert.save             saved  true          else break      catch OptimisticLockException e           reload concert object from the database         concert.refresh          if tries gt 9 break     tries  codepre  pAs you see above, I try to reload the object from the database, to get the updated object, with the correct number of tickets sold, but whatever I try refresh, reload, commit and begin new transaction, the object is not refreshed, and I still get the normal cached version of the object.p  pAny ideas on what I am doing wrongp  pMany thanksp  pAxelp  pPS I am not using any caching system, like memchached or other.p

Positive 2990 pThe sql for the database is available here a hrefhttppastebin.coma58BHjmW relnofollowhttppastebin.coma58BHjmWap  pIn IntelliJ, I added JPA facet, and no matter which provider I use, the foreign keys constraints of my students table are not being generated, hence I end up with the entity without any FK constraints and relationships. Also I was no able to find how to implement Serializable interface in IntelliJ. The code generated looks like thisp  precodeEntity javax.persistence.Tablename  students, schema  , catalog  test public class StudentsEntity  private int studentIdPk  Id javax.persistence.Columnname  studentidpk, nullable  false, insertable  true, updatable  true public int getStudentIdPk      return studentIdPk   public void setStudentIdPkint studentIdPk      this.studentIdPk  studentIdPk  codepre  pUsing Eclipse and the same db, I was able to generate the entities with proper relationships, constraints and annotations using JPA and EclipseLink. The code generated by Eclipse is as followsp  precode    Entity     Tablenamestudents     NamedQuerynameStudent.findAll, querySELECT s FROM Student s     public class Student implements Serializable      private static final long serialVersionUID  1L        Id       GeneratedValuestrategyGenerationType.AUTO       Columnnamestudentidpk       private int studentIdPk codepre  pIs there a way to achieve the same in IntelliJ, as the code generated by the IDEA seems to be wrong, while eclipse has no problems generating the entities. I am using IntelliJ Ultimate version. The database ERD and the ERD of generated entities is the same when using Eclipse, but not in IntelliJ as the constraints from the students table are completely missing.p

Positive 2990 pFirst of all, I am a freshman in terms of Java EE and the Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers. So please pardon me if my concern seems kinda trivial, but I did research for quite a while now and couldnt find any helpful resource regarding my problem.p  pI would like to establish a NoSQL database connection for my project using JPA and EclipseLink to a MongoDB running on the default localhost27017. I activated JPA 2.1 under my Project Facets and got stuck at the further configuration, especially the part with the Connection Profile see images below.p  pWhat Connection Profile do I have to choose Does one of the available profiles even match my concern MongoDB Am I on the right path at all or is my approach nonsensep  pAny help would be highly appreciated. I am open for all kind of suggestions.p  pLet me know if you need more information.p  pa hrefhttpimgur.comaHZphU relnofollowChoice of Connection Profileap
Positive 2990 pI know that this is a long shot question, but I cannot tell if Im even on the right path. I have an object codePcode and it has needs 30 codeManyToOnecode relationships.  I am trying to pull a list of 2500 records. I notice that if I request the data codeEAGERLYcode it takes about 60 seconds. if I request the data codeLAZILYcode it only take 5 seconds to get the data but then it takes about 55 seconds to loop through the list in my jsp I am displaying all fields of object codePcode. I understand that 30 relationships this way are a lot. I am ok with it taking 60 seconds as I plan to paginate the page anyway. My question is, Do these speeds sound normal good or does it sound like I am missing important optimization p  pany pointer would be help  I have been looking into this all week and really need any kind of help.p  pThanks.p

Negative 2990 pIm writing a routine to provide user definable keyboard shortcuts for any menu item in my Windows Mobile 5 application, which is in CMFC.

That works fine. But Im going to have a couple of these pages say RestrictedPage.aspx, RestrictedPage2.aspx, RestrictedPage3.aspx. Each of these pages is going to have my custom webcontrol on it. And each of these pages will have different allowed roles. My webcontrol has a dropdown list. The choices within the dropdown depend on the intersection of the users roles and the pages allowed roles.p  pAs mentioned below, searching the web.config with XPath would probably work. I was just hoping for something more frameworky. Kind of like SiteMap. When I put roles in my web.sitemap, I can grab them using SiteMap.CurrentNode.Roles my website is using Windows authentication, so I cant use web.sitemap for security trimming and Id rather maintain roles in only one file.p

Here are my conclusions and the revised codestrongp  pstrongConclusionsstrongp  ol liThe biggest culprit in my first attempt were the 2 equations that started with step space [] and step char []. strongMatching the second parameter of the step function against [] is a nonostrong, because it forces the whole 2nd arg to be evaluated but with a caveat to be explained below.li liAt one point, I had thought  might evaluate its righthand argument later than cons would, somehow. So, I thought I might fix the problem by changing   charxxs to  [char  x]  xs. But that was strongincorrectstrong.li liAt one point, I thought that pattern matching the second arg against xxs would cause the function to fail against infinite lists. I was emalmostem right about this, but not quite Evaluating the second arg against xxs, as I do in a pattern match above, emWILLem cause some recursion. It will turn the crank until it hits a  aka, cons. If that never happened, then my function would not succeed against an infinite list. However, emin this particular caseem, everything is OK because my function will eventually encounter a space, at which point a cons will occur. And the evaluation triggered by matching against xxs will stop right there, avoiding the infinite recursion. At that point, the x will be matched, but the xs will remain a thunk, so theres no problem. Thanks to Ganesh for really helping me grasp that.li liIn general, you can strongmentionstrong the second arg all you want, as long as you dont strongforce evaluation of itstrong. If youve matched against xxs, then you can mention xs all you want, as long as you dont force evaluation of it.li ol  pSo, heres the revised code. I usually try to avoid head and tail, merely because they are partial functions, and also because I need practice writing the pattern matching equivalent.p  precodemyWords  String gt [String] myWords string  foldr step [] dropWhile charIsSpace string    where        step space acc  charIsSpace space  acc       step char xxs                    charxxs       step  []                           error this should be impossible codepre  pThis correctly works against infinite lists. Note theres no head, tail or  operator in sight. p  pstrongNow, for an important caveatstrong When I first wrote the corrected code, I did not have the 3rd equation, which matches against step  []. As a result, I received the warning about nonexhaustive pattern matches. Obviously, it is a good idea to avoid that warning. p  pBut I thought I was going to have a problem. I already mentioned above that emit is not OK to pattern match the second arg against []em. But I would have to do so in order to get rid of the warning.p  pstrongHowever, when I added the step  [] equation, everything was fine There was still no problem with infinite listsstrong. Why p  pstrongBecause the 3rd equation in the corrected code IS NEVER REACHEDstrong p  pIn fact, consider the following BROKEN version. It is EXACTLY the SAME as the correct code, except that I have moved the pattern for empty list up above the other patterns p  precodemyWordsbrokenAgain  String gt [String] myWordsbrokenAgain string  foldr step [] dropWhile charIsSpace string    where        step  []                               error this should be impossible       step space acc  charIsSpace space      acc       step char xxs                        charxxs codepre  pWere back to stack overflow, because the first thing that happens when step is called is that the interpreter checks to see if equation number one is a match. To do so, it must see if the second arg is []. To do that, it must evaluate the second arg.p  pMoving the equation down BELOW the other equations ensures that the 3rd equation is never attempted, because either the first or the second pattern emalways matchesem. The 3rd equation is merely there to dispense with the nonexhaustive pattern warning.p  pThis has been a great learning experience. Thanks to everyone for your help.p

Negative 2990 pSo Im using the PayPal API.  They require bigger companies to send an X509Certificate along with each SOAP API request.  Ive never heard of using a cert, its always been just send the API signature along with an API request.p  pSo I first created a class called codeCerficatecode that implements the .NET codeICerfiticatePolicycode.  One of the member methods, really the only one you have to implement isp  precodeSystem.Net.ICertificatePolicy.CheckValidationResultSystem.Net.ServicePoint, System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate, System.Net.WebRequest, int codepre  pSo far Im having trouble really understanding what to pass to this method.  I guess the method simply validates that the Cerfiticate is valid.  So Im not sure what strongServicePointstrong is and what to pass into it.  I assumed it was my web service reference and a proxy class within such as the codePayPalAPIAAInterfaceClientcodep  pI also see a very old example using ServicePointManager.S for something but I dont understand it, even after looking at MSDN.  So I guess you are to use ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback and I suppose set the callback to the CheckValidationResult  If so, when do you do this  Its just very confusing to me.p  pAlso, So I guess I create an instance of my Certificate class and set the certificate properties by reading the P12 certificate from my disk and then pass in that to this method to check if its valid  I guess thats right.p  pIm still trying to figure out this whole thing and Im really stuck on the ServicePoint as well as WebRequest because really Im using a proxy class in PayPal which does the under the hood sending of the request.  So I dont see how I can even pass in type WebRequest because Im using a proxy method for that anyway.  So what would I even pass for the WebRequest param  Im using a SOAP API WSDL, not NVP here so Im not for example creating an HttpWebRequest variable like you do with REST services in order to send the API request over Http.p  pso far heres what Ive triedp  precode    PayPalAPIAAInterfaceClient client  new PayPalAPIAAInterfaceClient     Certificate x509Certificate  new Certificate     ServicePointManager.ServerCertificateValidationCallback  x509Certificate.CheckValidationResult     client.ClientCredentials.ClientCertificate.Certificate  x509Certificate codepre  pthe problem is, what do I pass in for the ServicePiont and the rest of the params for CheckValidationResult  I dont even know if Im calling this right.p

Negative 2990 pIve never quite understood how the argument lists for operator overloading are determined in a systematic way, and Im particularly confused by a problem I have now.p  pWhen you overload a unary operator it has one argument, or zero if its a class member.  When you overload a binary operator it has two arguments, or one if its a class member.  At least thats the way it would seem to work.  Im having a problem with codeoperator newcode not a class member however.p  pIn a codebase Im working in, as in other places I have seen in the past like a hrefhttpbartosz.combooktech9new.html relnofollowherea for example there is a define like codedefine new newFILE, LINEcode and a corresponding function with the signature codevoid newsizet size, const char file, unsigned linecode or something like it for memory debugging.  I note that the one in my project is actually different from the previously linked one.  This presents a problem for me, because for some reason its messing up a placement new.  Ive looked in emThe C Programming Languageem, and if it explains this Im missing it.p  pIs codenewcode special in this regard, i.e. does it have specific language defined extra debug signatures  It doesnt seem like it because, as I noted above, Ive seen slightly different signatures in different places.  If it does, what other operators have nonobvious signatures, and what are they  Are these varied signatures instead some implementation specific extras  If so, are there any general rules as to what most implementations do  Alternatively, is it an arity issue like I implied in my title  Can you just tack on as many extra arguments as you want in the signature and if you call new with the arguments between the codenewcode keyword itself and the new type you want you can just do whatever  Or am I even more confused, and theres something else Im missingp  pMost importantly in the short term although Id really like to understand this, whats going on the messes up my placement codenewcode  The macro is causing an expansion something like codenew file.cpp, 100 classpointer classtcode.  Is the problem the two groups in parenthesis maybe, or something elsep

Negative 2990 pThe setupp  pI have two managed contexts setup on an iPhone application. A main context that I use for most queries and a background context I use for long running operations that I want to happen in the background.p  pIve setup notifications for NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification against each managed object context. In response to the notification, I call mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification to sync up. It is also a requirement that any time things change on the main context, I need to run some jobs on the background context, as the state of things has now changed.p  pThis works fine, as long as only write in the one of the contexts. In this case, writing on the main context. However, if I write on the background context, this causes an infinite loop. Saving on the background context triggers the notification to the main context, which in turn merges the changes and fires its own notification, picked up by background context. This triggers the background context to perform its background jobs, which if they write anything start the cycle again.p  pIt seems that either this is the wrong setup, or I need a way to decouple the start processing background jobs any time something changes on the main context from the change notification, or I need to make the background context readonly.p  pIdeas Unlike a typical secondcontextisforimporting scenario, I believe that I needwant my background context to remain uptodate with respect to the main context, so that I get the proper results from my background job.p

Negative 2990 pemSOLVED Inside my classs constructor, I had a Semaphores construction racing with a Threads construction, where I wanted the Semaphore to be created first and the Thread second.  The solution that worked for me was to create the Semaphore first in a base class, that way I can depend on it in my derived class. emp  pI have a fairly small pthreads C program which works fine under normal conditions.  However, when using valgrinds thread error checking tools on the program, it appears to uncover a race condition.  What makes this race condition particularly difficult to avoid is that it is happening inside a Semaphore class which really just encapsulates seminit, semwait, and sempost, so I cant fix this with another Semaphore and shouldnt have to.  I dont think valgrind is giving a false positive since my program shows different behavior when running under valgrind.p  pHeres Semaphore.cpp  p  pre include Semaphore.h include ltstdexcept include lterrno.h include ltiostream  SemaphoreSemaphorebool pshared,int initial     mSemnew semt    ifmSem0     throw stdruntimeerrorSemaphore constructor error mSem  0   ifseminitmSem,pshared10,initial1     throw stdruntimeerrorseminit failed   SemaphoreSemaphore      semdestroymSem     delete mSem  void Semaphorelock    ifmSem0     throw stdruntimeerrorSemaphorelock error mSem  0    int rc   for     rc  semwaitmSem     ifrc0 break     iferrnoEINTR continue     throw stdruntimeerrorsemwait failed     void Semaphoreunlock    ifsempostmSem0     throw stdruntimeerrorsempost failed  pre  ul liNotice how Semaphores constructor creates a new semt named mSem, and throws an exception in the extremelyunlikely scenario that mSem still equals 0.  This just means it should be impossible for this constructor to allow mSem to equal 0.  Well...move on to Semaphorelock regardless of what thread this function is called from as well as the constructor, it shouldtheoreticallystill be impossible for mSem to be 0, right  Well, when I run my program under helgrind, Semaphorelock, sure enough, ends up throwing this exception Semaphorelock error mSem0 which I really thought should be impossible.li ul  pI have used this Semaphore class in other programs which pass helgrind with no problems, and Im really not sure what Im doing special here that is causing the issue.  According to helgrind, the race is happening between a write in Semaphores constructor in one thread and a read in Semaphorelock in another thread.  Honestly, I dont even see how thats possible how can a method of an object have a race condition with the constructor of that object Doesnt C guarantee that the constructor has been called before its possible to invoke a method on an object How can this ever be violated, even in a multithreaded environment  p  pAnyway, now for the valgrind output.

Negative 2990 pbr  Here is my problem,  I have 5000 arrays, I want to remove the elements in array4999  those are with identical name to array5000, then add to array5000. Comes out a new array,say NewArray1. then remove identical name elements from array4998 and  comes out NewArray2. Iteratively ,till all 5000 arrays are done with filter and leave only a new array,with no duplicate name in it. p  pWhat I am planning to do is as below example, Say  array  of codeEntitycode objects p  precodeinterface Entity  NSObject        NSString firstName      NSString lastName      NSNumber nid      object1         .         .         .      objectN  codepre  pI want to compare those two arrays on three key fields codefirstNamecode, codelastNamecode and codenidcode I do not care about the other fields. If the elements in array5000 and array4999 are same in these 3 fields, remove the corresponding elements in array4999 before adding it to array5000. The resulting NewArray1 should look as in the example belowp  precodearray5000  Tom,Jackson,235,....,          Dick,Martin,360,....,          Jimmy,Green,568,.... array4999  John,Mouson,125,....,          Dick,Martin,360,....

John,Mouson,125,.... codepre  pI found a method code voidremoveObjectsInArrayNSArray otherArraycode which is close to my needs, but this method will remove the elements in codeotherArraycode only if those elements are completely identical to the corresponding element in the reciever. For me, I only want to remove elements if codefirstNamecode, codelastNamecode and codenidcode fields are the same.     I want to filter   elements with identical name in array4999,then add it to array5000  to get NewArray1.  Next,filtering  array4998. Remove elements with  identical name to NewArray1 in it, then merge NewArray1 and array4998 to get NewArray2. Filter one by one on descending count ,till all 5000 arrays are done . Since performance is an issue  ,can anyone give me some ideas on my problem  Some code samples would be appreciated.br Thanks in advance.p

Negative 2990 pGreetings.p  pI have two classes, Database and Group. I want to be able to create instances of Group and call methods on those instances from within Database and to be able to distribute Group instance references publicly. However, I do not want to provide public access to the constructor or other methods in Group.p  pI originally thought that I could achieve this access restriction by making Group a private inner class of Database, but I discovered that I couldnt publicly distribute references to Group if it was private. Also, my attempts at making Group a public inner class failed, because if its methods were all private, Database couldnt access them, and if they were public, access was possible beyond Database.p  pstrongI am looking for a bestpractice technique for solving or circumventing this problem.strong Maybe I missed a necessary keyword somewhere Nothing I have found thus far in my research has indicated that C permits this granularity of control. I found a messy way to get around the problem, as Ive provided below in code. Its essence is this before every call in Database to a method in Group, set a field in Database, publicly readable but only privately settable, that Groups methods all check in their creating instances of Database before performing their intended operations. When reading the field via a public method in Database, the field is reset, preventing any further method calls on Group until Database sets the field again.p  precodepublic class Database        Field true if Database has just authorized a method call to a Group.     private bool groupisNextCallAuthorized  false       Invoked before every method call to a Group.     private void GroupAuthorizeNextCall          groupisNextCallAuthorized  true         Method, ordinarily called from Group, that checks its creating Database       that the Database itself authorized the method call on the Group. It       automatically resets the authorization to false to prepare for the next,       perhaps unauthorized, method call.     public bool GroupIsNextCallAuthorized          bool previousValue  groupisNextCallAuthorized         groupisNextCallAuthorized  false         return previousValue            Constructor creates a demo Group.     public Database            Create a Group, first authorizing the action.

After checking that the Database db isnt null, it verifies       that db actually requests and authorized this Groups creation via the       GroupIsNextCallAuthorized. method provided by Database.     public static Group CreateDatabase db            It will not create a dud instance of Group it will throw an exception           instead.         if db  null  db.GroupIsNextCallAuthorized             throw new System.ExceptionUnauthorized access.          return new Groupdb            This constructor is referenced internally by static Create. as above.     private GroupDatabase db          this.db  db            This is an arbitrary method showing that it must check that the Database       that created this Group authorized this method call before it will       perform its intended function.     public void SomeGroupMethod          if db.GroupIsNextCallAuthorized             throw new System.ExceptionUnauthorized access.           intended functionality...        codepre

Negative 2990 pSuppose I had a list of slogans short, multiword phrases, and people had voted for the ones they liked best, and I wanted to assess which words, if any, made some slogans more popular than others.  What would be the best way to achieve this  My first thought was just to find all the unique words in the set of slogans and score each one as the average number of votes of all the slogans that contain said word, but frequency should also come into play in some fashion, I think, so that the following should be truep  ul liIf Word A occurs in only the slogan that got the most votes and Word B only occurs in the slogan that got the secondmost, Word A is more popularitygeneratingli liHowever, if Word A occurs only in the topranked slogan and Word B occurs in both the second and thirdranked slogans, Word B should win, since it pushed more slogans to the top.li liHowever, a single occurrence of Word A in the top slogan should still trump three appearances of Word B in other slogans if theyre, say, in the middle, or bottom half, of the pack that is to say, there needs to be a balance of votegetting and frequency in scoring.li ul  pI also want to eliminate words that are generally common e.g., the or of.

The wsadmin tool is started with the following optionsp  precodewsadminclasspath CP javaoption Dpython.pathCP codepre  pBoth of those point to the same classpath, which contains all necessary JARs.p  pThe jython script gets a connection to a database, and calls a utility class to create a database script.  The utility class uses reflection to load other classes from the classpath that is a hardandfast requirement of the library we are using, it cant be changed.  It basically looks like thisp  precodefrom liquibase import Liquibase  def mainargs     conn  getConnectionargs     updater  Liquibaseconn     updater.update codepre  pDuring the update method, Liquibase uses reflection to instantiate some Java classes.  This is where I get a ClassNotFoundException, for example ClassNotFoundException com.foo.CustomUpdatep  pIn my script, I can import the com.foo.CustomUpdate class and get no errorsp  precodefrom com.foo import CustomUpdate c  CustomUpdateselect 1 print c.getUpdate codepre  pSo I know that the class is on the classpath.  My only idea is that it has something to do with the reflection aspect of the library we are using.  Has anybody else run up against anything like this  p  pMy only other idea, if the above is unfixable, is to split things out into a shell script and use Java to run the DB update and then wsadmin to deploy the EAR.  p

Negative 2990 pI am developing an app that lets the user record videos and photos. Now I am wondering what is the best way to store them p  pThe first idea is of course to save it in the users photo library, just as if he had recorded the photo from the Camera app, and use a reference to the files. Now theres the problem that the user can access and delete files from the Photos application, which may be still needed by my app. I dont think that I can prevent the user from deleting photos, but how do I deal with the inconsistency my app will suffer frombr The other way would be to take care of the storage myself. My app already uses Core Data, so I could convert the media files using an codeNSValueTransformercode to an codeNSDatacode object and store it as BLOB in Core Data. Then there are some more questions regarding the performance. I know that an SQLitebased Core Data can perfectly handle databases of several GB in size, but loading large data objects will take some time anyway. The obvious advantage is that the user is not going to make my app inconsistent, but is the performance penalty acceptable And most of all If I use a codeUIImagePickerControllercode to capture photos and videos, it is going to save it in the library anyway. To save it in Core Data, I would have to take the photo from there, convert it to an codeNSDatacode object, save it and delete it from the library again. This does not seem to be the right way to me. Also, UIKit provides me a function to get an codeNSDatacode object from a photo via codeUIImageJPEGRepresentationcode, but there seems to be no such function for converting videos.p  pAll in all, because of all those unanswered questions, I would like to use the first approach. But the inconsistency problem puzzles me. What is the best practice to deal with itp

Negative 2990 pstrongProblemstrong I am creating a bunch of ellipses and I want their fillbrush opacity to change according to a slider value. I bind the slider to a property and bind the ellipses FillProperty to the same property through a converter. When I update the slider, the ellipses dont change.

Negative 2990 pI have a .NET TreeView control with checkboxes on the leaves. I want to be able to get the value of the node when a checkbox is selected. Basically, this is a tree of email contacts and when the user selects a checkbox I want to pull the node value email address and place that in a text box. The second part is no problem, Ill just call a JS function to append the email to the text box. p  pSo, the issue is how to extract the nodes value from the checkbox with JS. Unless someone has an alternate method, I was thinking about extending the TreeView to not include a normal checkbox but rather one that can store a value. Note I have an existing control called CheckBoxValue that will do exactly this. Fundamentally, my question is how can I extend the TreeView to include this I believe this would be in the CreateChildControls method but would love some help.p  pAny ideasp  pThanks, Ryanp

Negative 2990 pLately Ive been searching for the best source control technologies for strongmy work projectsstrong. Ive been a subversion user for a while, but heard more and more about git. So I checked it out, and I very much liked the fact that it allows you to easily put your projects under source control, even offline, when you dont have access to a server. However in multiple programmer environments for instance at work the idea of a central server still has its benefits. Thats when I came across Mercurial, this seems to me to be the best of both worlds, since you can just put your project under source control offline, you can pull push to other people if they put up a webserver, but you can also use a central server to push to and pull from.. Combine that with the fact that something like bitbucket.com gives you the chance to start a strongprivate freestrong repository online..p  pSo am I right in my thinking, or are there some important subtleties with these source control systems in a work environment that I fail to graspp

Negative 2990 pIm writing a C program and I need some help understanding an error.p  pBy default, my program prints to the terminal STDOUT. However, if the user provides a filename, the program will print to that file. If Im writing to the terminal, I will use the codestdcoutcode object, whereas if Im writing to a file Ill create and use a codestdofstreamcode object.p  pHowever, I dont want to have to continually check whether Im supposed so to be writing to the terminal or a file. Since both codestdcoutcode and codestdofstreamcode objects inherit from the codestdostreamcode class, I figured I would create a sort of codeprintoutputcode function that accepts a codestdostreamcode object. Before calling this function, I would check to see whether Im supposed to print to a file. If so, Ill create the codestdofstreamcode object and pass it to the print function. If not, Ill simply pass codestdcoutcode to the print function. The print function then does not have to worry about where its printing to.p  pI thought this was a good idea, but I cannot get the code to compile. I have created an oversimplified example here.

Negative 2990 pI would like to know, how does the microprocessor lets say on SandyBridge architecture in long mode switches data from L1 code to L1 data cache and vice versa   Lets say a page was used for data storage, so it is cached in L1 cache. Then , during the execution of the OS, the instruction pointer jumps issuing a JMP instruction to the memory location that is currently cached in L1 data cache. Does the processor migrates data from L1 data to L1 code cache Same question for when the data management instruction is issued on an address that is stored in L1 code cache i.e. meaning that the address became good for data storage, not code execution How does the processor handles these issues p  pI am asking this because I am studying about self modifying code, if you have any additional info where I could read details about code cache, please post the linkreference.p

Negative 2990 pIm creating a desktop application that has a computeheavy operation that potentially runs for several seconds. Obviously there is a need to minimize the time of this operation. The operation is fairly easy to parallellize individual subtasks, and each subtask takes around 50ms on a single thread. On multiple threads, each subtask takes 45 times as long because 4050 time is spent in GC, effectively cancelling the speedup completely.p  pSo I need to give the GC less work. My first thought was to try to find which type of object was being garbage collected the most, but I realized that although I often do memory profiling, I had never searched for a pattern like this. Usually a look at heap snapshots, or differences between heap snapshots, but these show objects that are alive, not the objects that were created and disposed between those snapshots. So that is my first question what is the easiest way to find which types are created and garbage collected the most I tried looking for method call counts to see if some constructor was called suspiciously often, but all objects created in millions were only small struct types. These should have no effect on GC even if boxed if I understand things correctlyp  pThe algorithm creates hundreds of thousands of individual result point objects. These of course arent supposed to be gcd because they represent the output of the operation. But it leads me to my second question is the time spent in GC mostly dependent on the total number of objects or mostly depending on the number of objects actually collected Should I try to limit the number of result objects and instead use fewer but larger result objectsp  pEdit I found the time spent in GC by using the VS 2010 concurrency visualizer. Also, in the parallel piece of code most sections of blocked threads were waiting for gcp  pEdit I should clarify that the performance problem is because the execution is effectively serialized on the workstation GC. See for example the performance problem described in this post.p  pa hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combhshafiarchive20100617casestudyparallelismandmemoryusagevs2010toolstotherescue.aspx relnofollowhttpblogs.msdn.combhshafiarchive20100617casestudyparallelismandmemoryusagevs2010toolstotherescue.aspxap  pI cant do anything about the garbage collector blocking my threads and I dont think I want the server GC for a desktop app, correct. So in order to get a linear speedup for this operation, I need to reduce the number of times the GC is invoked. Most of the time wasted is actually wasted by other threads blocked waiting for one thread to do GC.p

Negative 2990 pIm just starting to learn how to use the Indy 10 components in Delphi XE2. I started with a project that will use the command sockets codeTIdCmdTCPServercode and codeTIdCmdTCPClientcode. Ive got everything set up and the client connects to the server, but after the client connects, any command the server sends to the client just freezes the server app, until it eventually crashes and closes after a deep freeze.p  pstrongProject Setupstrongp  pThe setup is very simple theres a small server app and a small client app, each with its corresponding Indy command tcp socket component. Theres only one command handler on the client.p  pstrongServer Appstrongp  pOn the server, I have a very simple wrapper for the context codetype TCli  classTIdServerContextcode which only contains one public property the inheritance is practically a requirement of Indy. p  pstrongClient Appstrongp  pThe client on the other hand works just fine. It receives the command from the server and does its thing. The client has a timer which autoconnects if its not already connected. Its currently set to try to connect after 1 second of the app starting, and keep attempting every 10 seconds if not connected already.p  pstrongProblem Detailsstrongp  pI am able to send one or two commands from the server to the client successfully client responds properly, but the server freezes a few seconds after sending the command. I have event handlers for codeOnConnectcode, codeOnDisconnectcode, codeOnContextCreatedcode, and codeOnExceptioncode on the server, which all they do really is either post a log or handle connectdisconnect objects in a list view.p  pstrongScreen Shotstrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYKGhf.png altServer app frozen after 2 clicksp  pFinally when the client app is gracefully closed, the server also gracefully snaps out of its frozen state. However if the client is forcefully closed, then the server is also forcefully closed. Thats the pattern Im seeing. It posts to a log on events with codePostLogconst S Stringcode which simply appends short messages to a TMemo.p  pIve done two projects and had the problem on both.

Negative 2990 pFollowind describes an issue I am running into using EF 4.2 and LINQ.  Ive tried this on multiple systems, and multiple flavors of SQL SQL Express and SQL 2008 R2 Sp1, VS 2010 Pro and Premium, both in 64 bit and 32 binaries, both with the debugger, and attempting to run the binary directly.  Im wondering what Ive stumbled against, if its an issue with EF, or more likely an issue with my code and Im missing some nuance either related to LINQ or EF.  Any assistance would be greatly appreciated, been at it for 6 hours, my Google JuJu is not strong enough Im afraid.p  pI have a simple model named session consisting of an ID Guid, Name String, and Timestamp DateTime.  I am able to add a session to the dbcontext, and have verified in debugging that the session record is indeed stored in the database.  The timestamp used to create the session object is stored in a local variable, and immediately after storing, I attempt to retrieve the session into a new instance of a session object.  The code that retrieves the session LINQ throws System.InvalidOperationException Sequence contains no elements with the following stacktracep  precodeat System.Linq.Enumerable.First[TSource]IEnumerable1 source at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ObjectQueryProvider.ltGetElementFunctiongtb0[TResult]IEnumerable1 sequence at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ObjectQueryProvider.ExecuteSingle[TResult]IEnumerable1 query, Expression queryRoot at System.Data.Objects.ELinq.ObjectQueryProvider.System.Linq.IQueryProvider.Execute[S]Expression expression at System.Data.Entity.Internal.Linq.DbQueryProvider.Execute[TResult]Expression expression at System.Linq.Queryable.First[TSource]IQueryable1 source at efwtf.Program.MainString[] args in dvs2010efwtfefwtfProgram.csline 19 at System.AppDomain.nExecuteAssemblyRuntimeAssembly assembly, String[] args at System.AppDomain.ExecuteAssemblyString assemblyFile, Evidence assemblySecurity, String[] args at Microsoft.VisualStudio.HostingProcess.HostProc.RunUsersAssembly at System.Threading.ThreadHelper.ThreadStartContextObject state at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.RunExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state, Boolean ignoreSyncCtx at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.RunExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state at System.Threading.ThreadHelper.ThreadStart codepre  pI am able to drill into ctx.Sessions in the debugger and see in the resultset that the session that I am trying to retrieve actually does exist, and if I iterate over the result set and manually compare the two timestamps I can extract the session as expected.  If I run the code and pass a timestamp value for a record that was added to the database in a previous run, it works.

Negative 2990 pHere is my situation, I have a page with a form on it. The form is just a query, so Im using the GET method. I have a variable which I am passing around as a token, the variable is of the form x2ampy5 since the variable is passed into my page as an encoded url it is just extra work to parse it out to a dictionary of x2,y5. What would be ideal is something like the followingp  precodeltform methodGET actionpathtoactionx2ampy5gt     ltinput typetext namesomeothervalgt     ... more inputs here etc. ltformgt codepre  pUnfortunately when I do it this way the browser erases the ending x2ampy5 and just appends the form fields as the arguments.

Negative 2990 pSo, I am currently working on an application that allows me to search journalists and view their contact details including, among other things, their latest tweets.p  pCalling the Twitter API is no problem at all, and I have a list of tweets for the current journo showing up fine.  However, I am trying to decide the best approach to seeing if I the user logged into our application have retweeted any of the journos tweets, so that I can display the tweet as having been retweeted.p  pLooking at the API documentation, I am looking into the following optionsp  blockquote   p1  Use a hrefhttpsdev.twitter.comdocsapi1getstatusesretweetedbyme relnofollowstatusesretweetedbymea to get the list of tweets that I   have retweeted, specifying strongmaxidstrong to be the highest id from the   list of tweets for the journo I am looking at.  What I am not sure of   here is if the maxid is going to limit by the max id of my tweets or   the max id of the retweeted tweets.p      p2  Use a hrefhttpsdev.twitter.comdocsapi1getstatuses3aidretweetedby relnofollowstatusesidretweetedbya for each of the journos tweets to    get a list of all the users who have retweeted that tweet and to check to    see if my user is in the returned list of users.  Downfalls of this is that there   could be thousands of retweeters and I can only return a maximum of   100 at a time.  That could mean a lot of requests just to find if I   retweeted one tweet.  This also means that I need to do this for each   of the journos tweets as opposed to getting the list of all my   rewteets above.p      p3  Use a hrefhttpsdev.twitter.comdocsapi1getstatusesretweets3aid relnofollowstatusesretweetsida to get a list of the retweets for   each of the journos tweets.

Negative 2990 pLike the title says, Im new to AS3Flash and trying to learn how to make games. Ive been following the tutorials from Gary Rosenzweigs Flash Game University both the book and the iTunes podcast. As a disclaimer, all of the code Im using comes from the above mentioned tutorials, I did not create them. Im merely splicing them together to try to make something work differently.p  pBefore I post up the code, let me briefly explain my problem and what Ive tried to do to solve it. Basically, I got the game to work fine when I used the tutorial code EXACTLY it used catcher.x  mouseX for movement , but I wanted to try to make the player catcher move with the left and right arrow keys instead of the mouse. However, when I put that in, the movement becomes erratic, and instead of smoothly moving left and right, the player jumps left and right, gaining speed constantly until it simply jumps off the screen. Needless to say, I have no idea why it does this.p  pAt first, I thought the code for my arrow based movement was wrong, so I copied and pasted it into a separate file to test and it worked fine, so I figure that for some reason the code that makes the rest of the game work was somehow breaking it.p  pI tried moving the code around to different places, but that didnt fix the problem in fact, it often made it worse.p  pI figure that Im missing something in terms of formatting my code unfortunately, none of the tutorials Ive found cover proper style for AS3 and I dont have any prior coding experience, so my code is probably disgustingly messyunorganized.p  pAs a final note, I apologize in advance for the messiness of my codeIm rather new to this and just trying to figure things out.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated, and thanks for taking the time to read thisp  precodepackage      import flash.display.     import flash.events.     import flash.utils.Timer     import flash.utils.getDefinitionByName       public class CatchingGame1 extends MovieClip          var catcherCatcher         var nextObjectTimer         var objectsArray  new Array         const speedNumber  7.0         var scoreint  0         var leftArrowBoolean  false         var rightArrowBoolean  false          public function CatchingGame1              catcher  new Catcher             catcher.y  350             addChildcatcher             setNextObject             addEventListenerEvent.ENTERFRAME,moveObjects                    public function setNextObject              nextObject  new TimerMath.random1000,1             nextObject.addEventListenerTimerEvent.TIMERCOMPLETE,newObject             nextObject.start                   public function newObjecteEvent              var goodObjectsArray  [Circle1,Circle2]             var badObjectsArray  [Square1,Square2]             ifMath.random lt .5                  var rint  Math.floorMath.randomgoodObjects.length                 var classRefClass  getDefinitionByNamegoodObjects[r] as Class                 var newObjectMovieClip  new classRef                 newObject.typestr  good              else                  r  Math.floorMath.randombadObjects.length                 classRef  getDefinitionByNamebadObjects[r] as Class                 newObject  new classRef                 newObject.typestr  bad                          newObject.x  Math.random500             addChildnewObject             objects.pushnewObject             setNextObject                   public function moveObjectseEvent              forvar iintobjects.length1 igt0i                  objects[i].y  speed                 ifobjects[i].y gt 400                      removeChildobjects[i]                     objects.splicei,1                                  ifobjects[i].hitTestObjectcatcher                      ifobjects[i].typestr  good                          score  5                      else                          score  1                                          ifscore lt 0 score  0                     scoreDisplay.text  Score   score                     removeChildobjects[i]                     objects.splicei,1                                            this is where it starts to have problems              make arrow booleans true         stage.addEventListenerKeyboardEvent.KEYDOWN, keyPressedDown         stage.addEventListenerKeyboardEvent.KEYUP, keyPressedUp         stage.addEventListenerEvent.ENTERFRAME, moveCatcher             function keyPressedDownEventKeyboardEvent                 if Event.keyCode  37                     leftArrow  true                  else if Event.keyCode  39                     rightArrow  true                                             function keyPressedUpeventKeyboardEvent                  ifevent.keyCode  37                     leftArrow  false                  else ifevent.keyCode  39                     rightArrow  false                                               function moveCatchereventEvent                      var catcherSpeedNumber  1                     ifleftArrow                         catcher.x  catcherSpeed                                           ifrightArrow                         catcher.x  catcherSpeed                                                          codepre

Problem was constructor calling constructor.p  pThere might be a better way to do this  Id be interested in hearing those...p  pI have MyClass that is derived from a QLabel.

So I made a slot to intercept the customContextMenuRequested signal and emit a revised one that has more data.p  pWhen I try to connect up this signal in the constructor, then my slot never gets called.  But if I move the Policy and connect lines out to the parent widgetnot class hierarchy parent so they execute after MyClass is fully constructed, then my slot will get called.  But I always want that to be connected for this class and it seems like something I would want in its constructor rather than counting on the parent class to remember to do it.p  pIs there something Im doing wrong  Or a better way to add data to a signalp  precodeMyClassMyClass  QLabel      QFont currFont  font     currFont.setPointSize15     setFontcurrFont      setBackgroundRoleQPaletteMid      stdcout ltlt connecting customContextMenuRequested ltlt stdendl      PROBLEM START      setContextMenuPolicyQtCustomContextMenu       Is there anything wrong with connecting from this to this in a constructor      QObjectconnectthis, SIGNALcustomContextMenuRequestedconst QPointamp,                      this, SLOTaddCellDataToMenuContextRequestconst QPointamp       PROBLEM END     MyClassMyClassQString ampcellString, int row, int col      QLabelcellString      MyClass     setRowrow     setColcol     This one is a slot void MyClassaddCellDataToMenuContextRequestconst QPointamp pos           This doesnt get printed if I connect in my constructor,          but it does print if I do the same connect from a parent widget.     stdcout ltlt called addCellDataToMenuContextRequest ltlt stdendl      emit customContextMenuRequestedForCellpos, row, col  codepre  pSo I would like the parent widget to just look for customContextMenuRequestedForCell but right now, the parent widget seems to need to be responsible for customContextMenuRequested as well.p

Negative 2990 pIm fairly new to jQuery, but I like it a lot Thumbs up to the developers p  pMy question is about the resizable function. The situation is as followsp  pI have a div parentdiv, and within I have 5 other divs directly next to each other, lets call them diva through dive. The parentdiv represents a timespan the longer it is, the more time it represents, and the five childrendivs represent the five stages within that timespan.p  pNow, I want to be able to resize lets say childdivc the fase it represents takes more time. The divs D and E must shift to the left while i resize C, because their fases are just happening later, not shorter or longer. The parentdiv must resize as well when im resizing C, because the total timespan will be longer.p  pI hope this is clear.

Negative 2990 pI would normally post this on nvidias developer forums but they are still offline from last months hacking. If anyone knows of another good community for these types of questions I would love to know about them.  p  pI am developing some software designed to test human vision. Right now I have two tests written one that presents a stereoscopic image using nvidias 3D vision v.2 glasses and another test that displays letters on the screen similar to the charts you see in an eye doctors exam room. My problem is the during the chart test the 3D vision is getting triggered and causing the screen to look dim. I can enable and disable the 3D vision through the nvidia control panel between running the different tests but that is a less then elegant solution. I am using DX9 and Visual Basic to develop my code. In order to trigger the 3D in the Stereoscopic test I am using the NVSTEREOIMAGESIGNATURE Method that is described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7377861nvstereoimagesignatureanddirectx1011nvidia3dvision titleNVSTEREOIMAGESIGNATURE and DirectX 1011 nVidia 3D Visionherea. Basically the method involves making a backbuffer that is twice the width of the screen plus an extra column of pixel data in the middle where you insert a special signature that tells the video card that it is a stereo image and the left half of the backbuffer should be displayed to the left eye and the right half to the right eye. I dont do any of that in my code for the Chart test but the 3d Vision is still getting triggered and I cant figure out why. Is there a way to tell the video card to temporally disable the 3d Vision functionality in the codep  pThanksp
Negative 2990 pI was recently tasked with the responsibility of cleaning up the health analyzer issues found on our SharePoint 2010 sites.  One of the errors we are receiving is strongAccounts used by application pools or service identities are in the local machine Administrators groupstrong This is affecting our Central Admin site, one content site and the SPTimerV4 service.  I did some looking around and sure enough, the accounts are sitting in the local admin account.  So I removed them.p  pI reran the analyzer and the errors still show up.  So created a new account in the domain, added it to the WSSWPG account, the IISIUSRS account and the databases as necessary.  However, on the first attempt to go to the site we receive the following errorsemHTTP Error 503. The service is unavailableem. The Event log states the following  emApplication pool XXXXXX has been disabled. Windows Process Activation Service WAS encountered a failure when it started a worker process to serve the application pool.emp  pIf I add the accounts to the local admin group, everything works fine, but if I remove them, and have to reboot the server for any reason then they have to be readded to the local admin group in order to work.  Even if I remove them from the local admin group that SharePoint Health Analyzer error keeps coming up.p  pDoes anyone have any thoughts.  Is the need to add the domain account to the local admin group an IIS issue, is this a SharePoint 2010 issue.  Has anyone seen this before or know what I am missing in my configuration.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 2990 pI am looking for a solution or to be told it simply is not possiblegood practice.p  pI currently have a database whereby I can create new orders and select from a lookup table of products that I offer. This works great for the most part but i would also like to be able to add random miscellaneous items to the order. For instance one invoice may read End of Tenancy Clean and the listed product but then have also an entry for 2x Lightbulb or something to that effect. p  pI have tried creating another lookup table for these items but the problem is i dont want to have to predefine every conceivable item before I can make orders. I would much prefer to be able to simply type in the Item and price when it is needed. p  pIs there any database design or workaround that can achieve this Any help is greatly appreciated. FYI I am using Lightswitch 2012 if that helps. p

Negative 2990 pHow Standard defines the life time of a temporary object constructed during evaluation of an codeifcode condition expressionp  pI looked for this information and found something similar in an example to point [10] in 1.9, page 10. Im referring here to Final Draft of the new specification. Yet still it wasnt clear enough for me and since Visual C acted differently than my understanding of that example I decided to ask.p  pPlease provide proper references to specification.p  hr  pIf you name the object it persists for the entire codeifcode so both codetruecode block and codefalsecode block but is destroyed before codeifcode ends.p  pFor examplep  precodeif  MyClass x  f    ...   else   ...   nextInstruction codepre  pcodexcode can be used in both codeifcode blocks but gets destroyed before codenextInstructioncode gets called.p  pBut what if you dont name itp  precodeif  f    ...   else   ...   nextInstruction codepre  pIn my understanding of the referenced part of specification the value returned by codefcode will be destroyed before execution enters one of the blocks either for codetruecode or for codefalsecode.p  pHowever Visual C destroys that temporary object as if it was named. emstrongEDITstrong as Tino Didriksen pointed out Visual C does work well here. And indeed now I confirm that as well. I must have made a mistake when looking at initial tests resultsemp  hr  pThis does matter in some edge cases lets not discuss here how likely they are or whether it is good to write code that way....p  pFor example lets havep  precodeclass ScopedLock  public   ScopedLock  if  isLocked  unlock     operator bool const  return isLocked      ...    codepre  pNow if we have code likep  precodeif  ScopedLock lock  resource.lock    ...   codepre  pwe can be sure that when execution enters the codetruecode block we own the resource and that it will not be unlocked before we leave that block.p  pBut what if someone wrote it like thisp  precodeif  resource.lock    ...   codepre  pNow it is crucial at which point the destructor for the temporary codeScopedLockcode will be called. Because it determines whether this code is correct or not in the sens of resource usage. Again lets skip discussing whether writing such code is bad in general. That is not the point of this question...p

Negative 2990 pI have some Fortran 90 code that Ive been using for finite element computations. Lately, Ive been trying to improve how it solves block linear systems. Before, I had a subroutine codeamuxcode used for sparse matrixvector multiplication and another subroutine codecgcode which implements the conjugate gradient method using codeamuxcode. I wrote a new matrixvector subroutine codeblockamuxcode and likewise a new solver codeblockcgcode. By all rights, the new method should run faster, but instead it runs 10 times slower.p  pIn order to track down the problem, I used the profiler gprof to see what was going on. I found that 92.5 of my code was spent running the codecgcode subroutine  even though I never called it, and relied exclusively on blockamux and blockcg. To muddy the waters even further, I put a print statement in the actual codecgcode routine saying Hello world it was never printed. Finally, I noticed that gprof lists no uses of the codeamuxcode subroutine, even though a genuine call to cg would have done hundreds of ordinary matrix multiplications.p  pIm mystified as to what could be doing this. Any thoughts I can attach the gprof output if that helps too.p  pUpdate I have made the following changes, with the same result some way or otherp  ol liChange the names of the subroutines, for example codecgcode becomes codeconjugategradientcode. Gprof then reports that Im wasting time in the new conjugategradient routine.li liMove the subroutines that I actually use into my main program under a contains statement instead of the module codelinalgmodcode in which they originally resided, then stop using the module containing the CG routine. Instead, the program wastes time in something called a framedummy. This looks suspiciously similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11444847whatdoesframedummymeaninthecontextofprofilingthis posta, but I cant li liMove the subroutines I use from codelinalgmodcode, which contains the CG routine, to a new module codelinalgmoddecoycode, which does not contain it. Instead of wasting time in the CG algorithm, gprof says that the program is calling a subroutine I use to generate the righthand side of the linear system 3000 times instead of just once.li liTry it on a different computer. No difference.li ol

Negative 2990 pI have a MPTT modified preorder tree traversal like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com02AAU.gif altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.come1F4j.gif altenter image description herep  ptaken from a hrefhttpwww.sitepoint.comhierarchicaldatadatabase2 relnofollowSitePointap  pMy real tree has thousands of nodes and a more complex structure, but this is a simplification that shows the problem.p  pUntil this moment, every time I need to change this tree I used a shell script that looks like thisp  precodebinbash mysql umyuser pmypass database lt tree.sql codepre  pand executes this emtree.sqlemp  precodeDROP TABLE IF EXISTS tree CREATE TABLE tree    parent varchar32 DEFAULT NULL,   title varchar32 COLLATE utf8unicodeci NOT NULL,   lft int11 NOT NULL,   rgt int11 NOT NULL  ENGINEInnoDB DEFAULT CHARSETutf8 COLLATEutf8unicodeci  LOCK TABLES tree WRITE INSERT INTO tree VALUES ....,........ codepre  pstrongNOTEstrong I use a shell script to do this because there are multiple instalations of the same PHP application in multiple servers and this is an easyfast way to update all them, but if is required I can move the update to PHP.p  pBut now, the requirements state thatp  ol liFoodMeat branch will always existli liFoodMeat subtree must be preserved because users can now edit its contentsli liOther parts of the tree must be updated FoodFruit in this case but the app is agnostic to the structure.li ol  pSo, given this I cannot execute a codeDROP TABLEcode, I need to retrieve a branch FoodMeat and insert it the tree after the codeDROP TABLEcode, codeCREATE TABLEcode and codeINSERT TABLEcode are executed.p  pThe question is how to retrieve a branch from shell and how to insert it again Note that if  its not possible to do it from shell script I can create two small PHP scripts, but still I have no idea of how to get the branch and insert it again, any idea welcomep
Negative 2990 pIve tried various ways to coerce xterm versions 285 and 292 to copy the selection to the CLIPBOARD clipboard whenever I press CtrlShiftC.  The most promising way thus far has been, in .Xresources, to put thisp  precodeXTermvt100.translations override      Ctrl Shift ltKeyPressgt C  copyselectionCLIPBOARD n     Ctrl Shift ltKeyPressgt V  insertselectionCLIPBOARD codepre  pCtrlShiftV works perfectly, but the copying has a nuance...p  pIf I restart xterm, highlighting text puts things in the PRIMARY clipboard this is expected, proper, default behavior.  If I hit CtrlShiftC, it properly copies the current selection to CLIPBOARD clipboard.p  pThe bug, however, is that if you highlight text after the first time you pressed CtrlShiftC, youll see that highlighting now copies to both PRIMARY emandem CLIPBOARD.  I cannot figure out how to stop xterm from updating CLIPBOARD upon selection... and it doesnt make sense to me that it would do it in the first place.p  pI said, at a specific point in time, to copy the selection to the clipboard... yet it just starts updating it automatically upon selection after doing it once... p  pAnyone have a workaroundp

I am able to draw the path, albeit inefficiently, but I cannot get the plane to animate along the path smoothly. p  pI originally tried to move the plane along the path by using the implicit animations provided by changing the position, but because it does not allow me to alter the speed of the animation, the plane behaves badly.p  pI am now trying to use an animation block recursively, but the completion block is being called way too soon, resulting in the plane just following the path being drawn.p  pThis is the setup codep  precode CALayer plane     ifplane         plane  [CALayer layer]         UIImage planeImage  [UIImage imageNamedairplane.png]         plane.bounds  CGRectMake20.0, 20.0, planeImage.size.width, planeImage.size.height         plane.contents  idplaneImage.CGImage         [self.layer addSublayerplane]          return plane   voidtouchesEndedNSSet touches            withEventUIEvent event     ifisDrawingPath         [self.trackPath addLineToPoint[[touches anyObject] locationInViewself]]         NSLog, self.trackPath          UITouch touch  [touches anyObject]         CGPoint toPoint  [touch locationInViewself]         now, save each point in order to make the path         [self.points addObject[NSValue valueWithCGPointtoPoint]]         [self setNeedsDisplay]         [self goToPointWithIndex0]          isDrawingPath  NO  codepre  pThis implementation works, but badly.

Negative 2990 pI am doing an assignment at the moment where I am building a hotel invoicing application and I have to ask the user for the customers registration number for valet parking. If NOTHING is entered it is assumed that the valet parking service is not required, but if SOMETHING is entered a 50.00 fee must be added to the displayed invoice.

I have used the IF statement previously in the assignment fine however it has a YES or NO input so I figured out how to code it in. The problem with the above section is that it has to have ANY input or NO input which directs the program what to do.p  pNote that the valetparkingsurcharge is setup as a double and vehiclereg is setup as a string and data has been either entered to indicate that the service is required or not entered to indicate that the service is not required at the start of the program.p  pI have only just started Java and this is my first assignment so I would appreciate any help that anybody can give me with this section.

Negative 2990 pIm working on redesigning a small companys website that uses the Volusion eCommerce platform.

Negative 2990 pIm creating an app which takes a photo each second and saves the image to the disk. When enough photos has been taken, the app creates a video of the images using the AVFoundation framework. This is done by creating a layer for each image, add an animation which hides  the layer after some time then combine these layers into a single layer which is held by codeAVVideoCompositionCoreAnimationToolcode. After creating a codeAVVideoCompositioncode which holds the animation tool, I will end up using codeAVAssetExportSessioncode to export an codeAVMutableCompositioncode.p  pHowever, while creating the layers my app will give two memeory warnings and then crash if I have 5060 photos or more. I use the below code to create the layers. This means that for 60 images, the below loop will run 60 times. Once for each image. The codeimageLayercode is created with the contents of the photo, an animation is applied to the layer and the layer is then added as a sublayer to codelayercode.p  precodeCALayer layer  [CALayer layer] layer.frame  CGRectMake0.0f, 0.0f, renderSize.width, renderSize.height layer.bounds  CGRectMake0.0f, 0.0f, renderSize.width, renderSize.height  for NSString imagePath in imagePaths      CMTime endTime  CMTimeAddcursorTime, CMTimeMake1.0f, CGFloatfps      UIImage theImage  [[UIImage alloc] initWithContentsOfFileimagePath]     CGFloat scaleFactor  MINrenderSize.width  theImage.size.width, renderSize.height  theImage.size.height     CGSize newSize  CGSizeMaketheImage.size.width  scaleFactor, theImage.size.height  scaleFactor      UIImage resizedImage  [theImage resizedImageToSizenewSize]     CGImageRef image  resizedImage.CGImage     CGSize imageSize  resizedImage.size      CALayer imageLayer  [CALayer layer]     imageLayer.frame  CGRectMakerenderSize.width  imageSize.width  0.50f, renderSize.height  imageSize.height  0.50f, imageSize.width, imageSize.height     imageLayer.bounds  CGRectMakerenderSize.width  imageSize.width  0.50f, renderSize.height  imageSize.height  0.50f, imageSize.width, imageSize.height     imageLayer.contents  bridge idimage     imageLayer.beginTime  CGFloatcursorTime.value  CGFloatcursorTime.timescale      CABasicAnimation hideAnimation  [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPathhidden]     hideAnimation.fromValue  NO     hideAnimation.toValue  YES     hideAnimation.additive  NO     hideAnimation.removedOnCompletion  NO     hideAnimation.beginTime  CGFloatendTime.value  CGFloatendTime.timescale     hideAnimation.fillMode  kCAFillModeBoth     [imageLayer addAnimationhideAnimation forKeynil]     [layer addSublayerimageLayer]      cursorTime  endTime  codepre  pIt seems to be this code which use too much memory.

That is NOT what I want to do, but I must say that I am a little embarrassed that Ive started a business making websites as a web design enthusiast going into college. What I want to happen is that I want the child menus of the navigation bar a hrefhttpaparturecreations.comaboutaparture.php relnofollowon my websitea to show on top of the other content. I have tried codepositionfixedcode on the child menus, and while the parent anchors dont follow the screen, when hovering the cursor over a certain part of the screen, the child menus will still drop 35px off the top of the page, even when the nav bar isnt visible on the page. All I want is for the child menus to be on top of all other content. And yes, I have tried codepositionrelative zindex99code on the menus with no luck of it staying on top of the zaxis. Anyone have any ideas Ill have a snippet of the navigation bar CSS belowp  precode.menu     height40px  .menu li     liststylenone     floatleft     height40px  .menu li a     displayblock     padding15pxt r b l     lineheight30px     textdecorationnone     colorF9F9F9     webkittransitioncolor .15s linear     moztransitioncolor .15s linear     otransitioncolor .15s linear     mstransitioncolor .15s linear     transitioncolor .15s linear  .menu lihover gt a     color C00     backgroundrgba38, 38, 38, 1  .menu ul     fontweight300     positionabsoluterelative positioning will turn this into a vertical nav bar, and absolute positioning will hide behind the white section below     opacity0     width150px     borderbottom4px solid C00     boxshadow0 .9em .9em rgba0,0,0,0.7     webkittransitionheight .1s linear     moztransitionheight .1s linear     otransitionheight .1s linear     mstransitionheight .1s linear     transitionheight .1s linear  .menu lihover gt ul     opacity1     backgroundrgba38, 38, 38, 1  .menu ul li     height0     webkittransitionheight .1s linear     moztransitionheight .1s linear     otransitionheight .1s linear     mstransitionheight .1s linear     transitionheight .1s linear  .menu lihover gt ul li     fontsize10px     width190px     marginleft40px     backgroundrgba38, 38, 38, 1     height30px     borderbottomrgba46, 46, 46, 1 1px solid     bordertoprgba30, 30, 30, 1 1px solid  .menu ul li a     padding0 0 0 10px     heightinherit     overflowhidden  codepre  pI do apologize about the mess of code and the amount of time it will take to analyze all that, but its not as bad as it looks.

Negative 2990 pI am using Selenium 2.35 and having a unpredictable error while trying to click on an element in firefox like thisp  precodenew Actionsdriver.moveToElementelement.click.perform codepre  pThe element Ive located is a lt span  element with a click event tied to it.  The issue I am running into is occasionally when Firefox tries to click on the element is misses and clicks on an entirely different element.  If I walk through my code using the debugger the issue never occurs which leads me to believe that the FirefoxDriver is just clicking on the wrong location on the browser, having to do with a timing issue.  There are dynamically loaded lt div s on my page that make the element I want to click shift down just before I locate it and send the .click command.  I believe this is the source of my issue.  I can put a Thread.sleep500 is ensure that it has enough time to finish animating and inserting the dynamic divs, but that seems sloppy to me.  Is there a way I can tell my FirefoxDriver to wait until the elements on the screen are done shifting around before it tries to send the .click eventp  pAlso, I have tried to send just the element.click but that seems to fail more often. p  pUpdate 9513p  pThe solution I came to with the help of MrTi s comment was the followingp  precodeprivate void jsClickOnElementByIdString id      WebElement element  wait.untilExpectedConditions.presenceOfElementLocatedBy.idid     JavascriptExecutor js  JavascriptExecutordriver     StringBuilder sb  new StringBuilder     sb.appendvar x    id       sb.appendx.click     js.executeScriptsb.toString  codepre  pJust to ensure the element is actually on the page I added the initial wait call, and then use the JavascriptExecutor to run some jquery and click on the element on the page.  This seems to work great for my case.  If anyone has help as to some drawbacks to this solution they would be greatly appreciated as Im fairly new to the JavascriptExecutor class.p

Then I thought about something like this...p  precodedescribe Something, gt     it should be triggering even, done gt         instance  new Something         instance.onitsdone, done         instance.methodCall codepre  pThis works correctly and when event is not triggered, test will fail after 2 seconds. However there is no verification, that it was triggered only once. Maybe I need another test for that  Since I already know its triggered at least once, I can use test with spy after this one probably. Although it seems too much hassle for one event.p  pAnother dirty approach could be thisp  precodedescribe Something, gt     it should be triggering even, done gt         spy  sinon.spy         instance  new Something         instance.onitsdone, spy         instance.methodCall         setTimeout gt             spy.should.have.been.calledOnce             done         , 0 codepre  pIt isnt probably really bulletproof. It would need bigger timeout probably to be sure. However that means tests will take longer to process, which is not good idea.p  pDo you have any other ideas how this should be solved p

Negative 2990 pstrongContextstrongp  pIm currently trying to design a model generator for hybrid Android apps. The goal is as follows given emanyem hybrid Android app developed using PhoneGap, generate a UI model that describes the UI states in this case, Im treating the UI state as equivalent to the DOM state and the transitions to these UI states denoted by actions  e.g., click on DOM element X. The model is represented by a finite state machine, where the nodes are the UI states and the edges are the transitions.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pMy current task is to come up with a way to figure out whether a DOM element has an event handler registered to it lets assume for now that were only interested in the eminitialem DOM state. With the help of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma4471062825340this StackOverflow answera, I was able to come up with a solution that uses webView.loadURLjavascript  .... to determine if an element has an event registered to it either by using, for example, element.onclick, or by using methods provided by libraries like jQuery and Prototype. However, I am currently unable to determine if an element has an event registered to it via addEventListener, for reasons specified in that same StackOverflow answer. Again, for simplicity, lets assume were only interested in events registered right after the page loads, prior to any user interactions.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ol liThe approach Im planning to take is as follows I plan to intercept the JavaScript code from the PhoneGap app. Once intercepted, I will instrument the code e.g., using Rhino such that after each call to addEventListener, I will place a marker for the DOM element involved in that call. I will then pass this instrumented code to the WebView so that it is this instrumented JavaScript code that gets loaded instead of the original JavaScript code. By doing so, I can determine which elements addEventListener was called on. This seems pretty straightforward, but the problem is, I cant figure out a way to eminterceptem the JavaScript code for instrumentation, and to empassem the instrumented code so that it gets loaded in lieu of the original. Are there any tools that would allow me to do this intercepting and passing, as described By the way, Im using the Android emulator to run the PhoneGap app.li liAre there any other approaches that are perhaps simpler or more elegant and I should considerli ol

I add this object as a property on the object above it. I continue going until I find the matching . This then finalizes whats in that object.p  pBasically, Ive never done anything like this before, and was wondering if there is some established way of doing this, or will I need to do something like what I described abovep

Negative 2990 pIm attempting to print out the 640 paths in this subway system. I know there are 640 paths, as I already did this program with an adjacency matrix. Now I need to do it with classes.

Negative 2990 pI needed to write a query to find when the close price dropped below a threshold 5.0 in this case within a certain date range.

The match result look like this p  precode00000....00011000...00011110000...000 codepre  pwhere 0 indicates nonmatch and 1 indicates match. The matched frame appeared 26 in sequence and appeared rarely while most of the other frames has different hash value.p  pThe hash is computed on the frame data buffer extracted using a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19377938howtogetrawframedatafromavframedataandavframelinesizewithoutspecodeavpicturelayoutcodea.

I dont think it is a packet loss problem. Because, first, I rerun the same process several times and the hash value of the received frames are the same otherwise the result should be different because packet loss is probabilistic. Secondly, I even try to stream on tcp192.168.1.10012345 and tcp192.168.1.10012345listen on PC, and the received frame hash are still the same  different than the hash result on the Pi.p  pSo, does anyone know why the streaming to a remote address will yield different decoded frames Maybe I am missing some details.p  pThanks in advancep

It appears to only do this after a Frame.Navigate.p  pI need to access AppViewModel because I have to inspect the properties on there in order to work out which Page to load.  Hence its a chickenandegg situation.  p  pIf I separately instantiate AppViewModel inside OnLaunched, then I can access AppViewModel, but then ViewModelLocator gets instantiated twice which causes problems with my IoC.p  pIs there a way of manually instantiating items declared inside app.xaml  Or is there a way to get app.xaml to load its resources before presenting a UI p  pOr am I doing this wrong Generally speaking, I regard the application to be the view model layer and the views essentially observe that... so hence I need the ViewModels available before I present any UI.p  pXAMLp  precodeltApplication.Resourcesgt ltvmViewModelLocator xKeyLocator dIsDataSourceTrue gt ltApplication.Resourcesgt codepre  pCodep  precodeprotected override void OnLaunchedLaunchActivatedEventArgs e      var vml  App.Current.Resources[Locator] as ViewModelLocator  exception raised codepre  pExceptionp  blockquote   pWinRT information Cannot find a resource with the given key.p blockquote  pthanksp

The sprite needs to be on the screen when I open the camera, and that image needs to be savedp  pHopefully Ive explained what I am trying to do because I cant find any information on thisp

Im sure it is not right since most of the time emfree memoryem is very little and what I can use in fact can easily exceed that without any issues. I also tried emfree memoryem  eminactive memoryem. Still seems not quite right since I can use more than that without issues in my experiments. One difficulty involved here is that when my app is active and needs more memory the system can kill other inactive apps to spare more memory to my app. I need to take this laterspared amount into account when calculating the remaining memory that I can use.p

Negative 2990 pI have been trying to use NSUserDefaults to save what level the player is on in my game. p  pI have been looking on the internet and it seems that you save an object in the app delegate file in the voiddidEnterBackgroundUIApplicationapplication it gives you whenever you start a new project. p  pThen you can load the saved object in the BOOLapplicationUIApplication application didFinishLaunchingWithOptionsNSDictionary launchOptions it gives you.

This may not be the best way to use the data but I must show a codehasacode relationship and this is the only opportunity I can find to use it.  p  pAt the end of it all, I was hoping I could use something like...p  precoderesult.stationid.location where stationid is of type Station codepre  p...to find where a set of data was taken.

Negative 2990 pI have a native C application that creates a JVM via JNI, instantiates a Java class an Akka Actor and invokes asynchronous nonblocking functions on it. I do this using JNI in C see snippet below.p  pNow I need to be notified in C when an Akka response arrives to my Akka Actor. For this I need to pass a native function pointer to Java so that the Akka Java Actor can callback to C when the response arrives. How can I do that p  pNote that using thread synchronization primitives within the Akka Actor would be completely wrong because the Actor would not be able to receive messages if blocked awaiting for some monitor e.g. a codeCountDownLatchcode. p  precodeJavaVM jvm  NULL JNIEnv env  NULL JavaVMInitArgs vmargs JavaVMOption options  new JavaVMOption[1] options[0].optionString  Djava.class.pathhomeazgcodehpcmomtarget1.1.9SNAPSHOThpcmomcmaeshpcmomcmaes1.1.9SNAPSHOT.jar vmargs.version  JNIVERSION16 vmargs.nOptions  1 vmargs.options  options vmargs.ignoreUnrecognized  JNITRUE JNIGetDefaultJavaVMInitArgsampvmargs   create JVM JNICreateJavaVMampjvm, void ampenv, ampvmargs if jvm  NULL      throw stdruntimeerrorfailed creating JVM  else      loginfo ltlt succeeded creating JVM    find CmaesClient class jclass cmaesClass  envgtFindClasscomsfoamhpcmomcmaesCmaesClient if cmaesClass  NULL      throw stdruntimeerrorfailed finding CmaesClient class  else      loginfo ltlt succeeded finding CmaesClient class  codepre

But when an object, which is OUTSIDE of the loaded objects in the tableview is updated, the delegate methods arent being fired. p  pWhat I intend to happen is for example I have loaded the first 30 objects and object 75 gets updated in which now it should be at the top of the table. Currently I just force a refetch when a user switches to another view and goes back. Can someone can give me pointershelp on thisp  pThank you very much in advance.p

Negative 2990 pi got dataset like this p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6NhIg.png altdata setp  pi need to analyse and predict the status column. This is just 2 entrees from the training data set. In this data set there is heart rate patternwhich is collected in 1 second intervals, 10 numbers altogether its a time series arraycorrect me if im wrong i just need to know best way to analyse and get a prediction using this data. Im using scikitlearning for my datamining and machine learning. p  pWhat i just want to know is what is the best way to analyse these time series data should i use vector based approach or something else. If you can give me example code that would be great for me to understand it.p
Negative 2990 pI need an Arraylike data structure that supportsp  precodea.[i] codepre  pin time O1 andp  precodea.[i..j] codepre  palso in time O1. p  pO1 updates are emnotem a requirement. Really, all I need is a constant Array with a notion of inplace slice or subarray. p  pI could of course construct such a thing from codeArraycode, but Id be happier if I could use one that already existedp
Negative 2990 pI have an application that Im porting from C to Java. There is a section C code that I find really strange.p  precodetypedef stdstring ArgName typedef stdmaplt ArgName, AnyData gt ArgumentMap  class Arguments  public ArgumentMap      public      Very important note When read finds a numericset argument,      it sets anyData.kind to Int. But STILL, it fills anyData.dString,      just in case. So if the ArgumentMap was built by Argumentsread,      the dString fields are all filled.     bool read int argc, char argv        remains is filled with the arguments not starting with .     bool read int argc, char argv, stdvectorltconst chargtamp remains        const if fails, erases arg if succeeds.     bool getNumericParam const ArgNameamp name, intamp num        sw is true if the switch is present. The function      returns false if the argument value is not empty.     bool getSwitch const ArgNameamp name, boolamp sw       bool getSwitchConst const ArgNameamp name, boolamp sw  const       Returns true if the switch is present. Throws an error message if      if the argument value is not empty.     bool getSwitchCompact const ArgNameamp name       void checkEmptyArgs const   codepre  pIt looks like in there original C the author is making their Arguments class inherit from a Map. This makes no sense to me. Map is an interface which means you cant inherit from it, you can only implement it. Is this something that can be done in C that you cant do in Javap  pAlso, I dont understand why you would use a typedef. I read the definition from a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTypedef relnofollowWikipediaap  blockquote   ptypedef is a keyword in the C and C programming languages. The purpose of typedef is to    form complex types from morebasic machine types[1] and assign simpler names to such    combinations. They are most often used when a standard declaration is cumbersome,    potentially confusing, or likely to vary from one implementation to anotherp blockquote  pBut I dont understand why the author would do that here. Are they trying to say that they want to inherit from the class AnyData and that ArgumentMap should have a Map as one of its fieldsp

Negative 2990 pI created a cocos2dx project and there is a class called codeAppController.mmcode where an EAGLView object codeglViewcode is created. The accessibility of codeglViewcode is set to trueyes by default but I want it to be falseno so I can access my elements which are behind the EAGLView with an automation tool like UI Automation Tool by Xcode. Now when I try to set the accessibility of that view to false, I use that line of code in codeAppController.mmcode after its createdp  precode[glView setIsAccessibilityElementNO] codepre  pBut this setter doesnt do anything. It ignores that and is still trueyes. In a test project, I override the getter in codeEAGLView.mmcode like thisp  precode BOOL isAccessibilityElement      return NO  codepre  pand it works perfectly fine. The problem in my real project is, that I dont have access to codeEAGLView.mmcode so I thought using the setter would be nice but it doesnt do anything.p  pIf I use p  pcode[glView setAccessibilityElementsHiddenYES]codep  pthen it works doesnt ignore it but of course everything is hidden, so I cant even have access to my own elements which are under EAGLView. I just want to hide this specific codeglViewcode.p

Negative 2990 pI have a C program in which the debugger has very peculiar behavior in regards to breakpoints.p  ol lipIf the breakpoints are already set when I Start Debugging, then the debugger stops at the breakpoints.pli lipIf I add breakpoints while the program is running, the debugger will not stop at any of those breakpoints.  However, the debugger will continue to stop at the breakpoints which were already set when I started the program.  To get the new breakpoints to work correctly, I have to stop the program and then start it again or detach and then reattach the debugger.pli lipAlso, if I disable a breakpoint while the program is running and then I reenable the breakpoint, then the debugger no longer stops on that breakpoint.  In order for the breakpoint to work correctly again, I have to stop the program and then start it again or detach and then reattach the debugger.pli ol  pI would prefer not to have to detach and reattach the debugger every time that I want to add a new breakpoint.  Does anyone know why this is happening and how to make it so that the debugger correctly stops at breakpoints which are added during runtime  This doesnt happen with any other programs.  Only this 1 program has this issue.  With all of other programs Ive ever debugged, I am able to set breakpoints during runtime and the debugger stops with no problems.p  pI am using Visual Studio 2010 service pack 1 and .NET framework 4.  Though, the issue also existed when I was using older versions of the .NET framework.p
Negative 2990 pIm working on an application which, based on a MySQL database, dynamically creates a UI that can be used to create and execute queries against that database. The database I am currently using contains about 400,000 rows with 77 columns. p  pWhen I execute a query that will return about half or more of the database an httpd thread is created that continues to grow in size, quickly taking up all the memory on my machine. The raw CSV I imported to create the database is only around 150MB. p  pI am developing with the Yii framework for PHP. Here is what my query code looks likep  precodequeryResults       YiiappgtdbgtcreateCommand           gtselect           gtfromtablename           gtwherewhere           gtqueryAll codepre  pIn this case where is a value being passed via AJAX. After performing some checks on the query I then send it back to the client as suchp  precoderesponse[success]  true response[results]  queryResults echo jsonencoderesponse codepre  pHere is a screenshot of what the httpd request created by a large query looks likep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comStykR.png althttpd process screen shotp  pWhen the process is initially created it jumps up to around 90 CPU usage. This query stayed at around 1.8GB real memory usage and still brought my machine to a halt until I manually stop the process. The machine I am working on at work only has 4GB of RAM. p  pIm not sure what I am doing wrong. I have been looking into seeing if apache is configured incorrectly or if I should be using an unbuffered query in PHP but Im still not sure what I must to do fix this memory issue. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank youp

Negative 2990 pI want to store user data outside the aspnet db on top of whatever aspnet db requires.p  pI dont want to extend aspnet db with new properties, im perfectly happy with the default implementation and im using the user GUID as a pivot point between my user and the aspnet db user.p  pI activated social connections Facebook Google amp twitter and im wondering when it would be a good time to link the user GUID on aspnet db with the user id create in my own db. In the case of registering without social buttons its easy, i can do it in the register action, but where should i do this for social buttonsp  pOr better yet is there some form of event i could subsribe for when a user is created regardless of how it is created My goal is to say whenever a new user is created, create a default initialized user in my db with same guid. Am i doing this the wrong way by doing it in the register actionp

Instead, they can be requested with a simple codeself.canDisplayBannerAds  YEScodep  pNow, I cannot set my View Controller as the banner delegate because there is no banner for me to access to my knowledge. p  pI need to know when the banner is tapped and when that action is dismissed so I can properly pausestart my Sprite Kit game.p  pHow am I supposed to have these delegate methods called so I can properly respond to the users actionsp  pAFAIK, there is nothing in the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationiAdReferenceUIViewControlleriAdAdditionsReferenceReference.html relnofollowUIView Controller iAD Additionsa that explains how to set the delegate for the banners.p  pDo I need to create the banners manually, or is there a way to achieve this while still using the newer APIsp

Negative 2990 pIm trying to make a chorolpleth with a rotating globe in d3. I can get the globe to render out fine but I cant get the countries to fill with the proper color scale. p  pLonger explanation. I basically started with Mike Bostocks code for the spinning globe found herep  pa hrefhttpbl.ocks.orgmbostock6747043 relnofollowhttpbl.ocks.orgmbostock6747043ap  pIve got some economic data for about 85 countries that Im reading in from an external csv. And Im trying to get the colors to map to the countries per the values in the csv. Theres another Bostock example of a choropleth here static and just the US and referenced frequently in SO d3 questionsp  pa hrefhttpbl.ocks.orgmbostock4060606 relnofollowhttpbl.ocks.orgmbostock4060606ap  pWhat I end up with are solid white fff countries on the face of the globe. Which is not what Im trying to get.p  pI added the ISO 31661 numeric codes to my csv so that I could match them to the same ids inside the topojson data. So my csv looks likep  precodecountry     id      curracct Germany     276     260.9 Sweden      752     7.24 Etc. codepre  pMy first thought was just to create a variable that was a function, which went through the length of the countries from the topojson data and found the countries where the id equaled the id from the csv countries, then assigned the scaled color to them. Then I set context.fillStyle equal to that variablefunction. That didnt work. p  pThen I just put context.fillStyle directly inside of a function which is the code as its currently written below. That didnt work either.  p  pAgain, Im trying to get the 85 or so countries with data in the csv to appear colorcoded on the front side spinning globe according to the scale Ive set up. p  pMy guess is that there is something I dont understand about the variable context and what its handling. If this were .stylefill, [put my function here to map the colors] syntax I would be okay. So, anyone got any thoughts p  pIm not a coder. Actually I guess I am as I am trying to write some code. Maybe I should just say Im a selftaught and mostly terrible coder. Although through examples, the JS console, and other questions on SO, I can usually work out where the errors are. This time Ive reached a wall. Any help is appreciated.

Negative 2990 pIm new to server programming and programming in general, and Im currently developing an app. The app will allow users to create Games that have a latitudelongitude location and a time and date, among other data, which will be stored on a server. They can also find Games created by other users based on their location. Games are archived so that they can only be retrieved by Game ID, not location after the given time.p  pAdditionally, every Game will have a unique numerical ID, and every newlycreated Game will have a larger ID number than the previous one So the data will be in order by ID without any need for sorting, and users can find a Game using this ID For example, if their friend invites them by sending them the ID.p  pIn summary Users can find data by proximity or unique ID, and data gets archived So that it can only be retrieved by ID after a given date and time each Game has a separate expiration date.p  pMy question is this How should the server store this data What I have considered doing is this, which seems rather inefficientp  ul liStore all game data in a keyvalue database, using the game ID as the key.li liKeep a list of the IDs of all games that havent expired, in the order of when they will expire. That way, every so often, I can check the first item on the list to see if has expired, and if it has, delete it from the list and take other appropriate actionsli liSomehow store those same IDs in a quadtree based on their location.li ul  pIs there any sort of data structure that could do this more efficiently And for that matter, at what kind of user volume should I even worry about making it more efficientp

Negative 2990 pHere is the scenario, Im using Beanstalkd queue to send an email to a huge list of emails 50000, each email has to have some unique content so the fired job loops over all the addresses, generates the content and sends the mail.p  pSometimes the user may want to cancel the operation in the middle of sending, so for example while the job is running and after the mail was sent to say 20000 addresses, the user clicks on Stop which should delete the job.p  pwhat I have done so far is that I managed to get the running job instance, QueuePush returns the job ID, so I save this ID saved in DB, and when I want to stop the job this is what I tried to do p  precodephean QueuegetPheanstalk  res  pheangtpeekJobID  returns a PheanstalkJob job  new IlluminateQueueJobsBeanstalkdJobapp , phean, res , default   res  jobgtdelete  returns NOTFOUND  data  jobgtgetRawBody  returns correct data, so Im sure this is the right job instance codepre  pso why do I get NOTFOUND, although when I use      supervisorctl tail f queuename  I can see that the job is still running and outputting content p  pAny help  If there is a better approach than trying to get the job and delete it this way Im open to suggestions, I thought about saving the job ID in database ID , status, and when I want to delete it I alter the ID status, and In the loop that is running within the job it checks every time, or maybe every 10 times, and if the status is equal to 1 for example then jobdelete, but this will be so slow as it will hit the db in every loop.p

Negative 2990 pHave a look a hrefhttpwww.jssor.comdemosintroductionslider.html relnofollowat this demoa. As you can see captions are being animated one after another. Is is possible to have all the captions start together but with specific delay. Like p  ol liCaption 1 after 100 milliseconds li liCaption 2 after 500 millisecondsli liCaption 3 after 800 millisecondsli ol  pI know all the animations can be flattened by using codePlayInMode 1code in config but that doesnt do the trick Im looking for. I was looking for an option like slider revolution a hrefhttpthemepunch.comrevolutionhomesliderfullscreen relnofollowin this examplea. Notice that all the animation elements do not come one after another. There are overlaps. Its like animation in multiple layers in a timeline in flash. p  pAnyone has any idea if this can be achieved by jssor p

Negative 2990 pIm trying to refer to a named range within the lookup array part of the match function within an active cell formula. It needs to be a named range to the best of my understanding because Im going to later run the code over multiple tabs and on each tab the amount of cells that contain data to form the lookup array in column AJ2 will differ in size and the match function doesnt work if you run it over a column that also contains empty cells. This is my code as it currently stands and Im getting the Method formula of object range failed error. Its definitely the match bit thats causing it because when I go into the cell and change that manually to refer directly to the cells in the array it works fine, but I cant do this as it needs to be futureproofed to run over multiple tabs and the lookup array length changes on eachp  precodeSheets1.Select Dim rangeh As Range Set rangeh  RangeAJ2 Set rangeh  Rangerangeh, rangeh.EndxlDown  Sheets1.Select RangeR2.Select ActiveCell.Formula  VLOOKUPINDIRECTAJampMATCHQ2, amp rangeh amp ,11,AIAK,3,FALSE codepre  pIt also has to be an ActiveCell.Formula because R2 is itself going to be dragged down on each tab to a different place depending on the length of data in the adjacent column Q.p  pAny help appreciated.

Negative 2990 pI have a deferred rendering particle system and Im trying to improve the generation of the billboards normals for the normal map pass. Currently I render the billboard normals as a forward facing Z. When the light render passes draw the scene, they interact with the billboards moreso when the BB is facing the light as expected. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comH7ntZ.png altenter image description herep  pHere is what the normal pass looks likep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBrpCJ.png altenter image description herep  pThis works as expected... however I would like to better simulate a kind of volume effect on the particles. I want to treat each billboard as if though its more sphere like. My thinking is that the lighting interactions with the particles would be better as a sphere has a wider range of normal directions. I.e. Id like to mimic something like this The white border would be a single billboardp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkEBSq.png altenter image description herep  pIs this a good idea I dont really know how to go about doing it. p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI am using points for the rendering, and my current thinking is something like thisp  precode   normal.x  glPointCoord.x    normal.y  glPointCoord.y    normal.z  1.0 codepre  pBut the glPointCoord doesnt seem to be producing the effect i thought it does.

But then it struck me is it safe to use codeasynccodecodeawaitcode in the manner shown abovebr I mean after calling codeawait blahcode the caller continues execution. Which means it might render the response back to client before codeawait blahcode completes. Is this right And if this is the case what happens to codedoSomethingcodecodedoSomethingElsecode. Will they ever be executed If theyre executed does the user see the effects of their changesbr In my case these methods change some data displayed to the user, but Id also like to know what would happen in the general case.p

Negative 2990 pThis is probably has a really easy solution, since it is one of the most basic things in web design. p  pAfter a lot research and not finding the answer decided to ask it. Basically my webpage looks        perfectly fine on my 13 Macbook but all the elements get messed up when I try to display it on my 27 desktop. I understand the core of the problem is that, when I set something to 300px, it covers much of the screen in 13 but just a little in 27 thus causing everything to sit on top of each other but I failed at finding a solution. Just to be clear, this is not a 100 issue of responsiveness, I dont want different layouts for different screens but I just want the same layout to look ok in many screens, just like you are resizing the page from the corners. Here is some of the code that I hope will be helpful. Also things that I have triedp  ol liUsing em instead of px. Not really helpful. li liUsing  instead of px.

Negative 2990 pSo Im trying to render the depth map of a scene using three.jsp  pAn example can be found here a hrefhttpthreejs.orgdocsReferenceMaterialsMeshDepthMaterial relnofollowhttpthreejs.orgdocsReferenceMaterialsMeshDepthMaterialap  pThe depth map looks good when the scene is setup carefully, for examplep  precodecamera.position.z  30 camera.near  0.1 camera.far   50 object.position.z  0 codepre  pHowever, if the camera is setup in some other ways, for examplep  precodecamera.position.z  600 camera.near  550 camera.far   650 object.position.z  0 codepre  pIn the second example, the depth resolution is all taken up by the depth range from 45 to 50 in the world coordinate system. This means for 50 lt objects.position.z lt 45, you can still see grayscale values in the depth map. Anything that has depth ranging from 45 to 50 will appear completely white in the depth map...p  pIdeally, I would like to see depth values uniformly distributed in the 50 to 50 range.p  pIs there a way to get the depth map I want Is there a way to increase the precision of depth mapp  pEventually, I would like to save the Depth Map of the three.js scene as a .png image on to local disk for some analysis.

What I am looking for is a smooth animation to set each image at given time. I have currently is NSTimers to trigger a method then I have code within the method to set a image and another NSTimer to set another image which is in a method so fourth. It gives the animation I am looking for but the problem I am facing is that I am developing a game and I want when the user pauses the game it stops on the current image it is on. The game runs on a NSTimer which triggers a method. All I do to pause the game is to invalidate the NSTimer.p  pWhat approach should I takep
Negative 2990 pI have a problem for which I do not know the solution. I am creating game that involves multiple players. One person hosts the game and sends invitations to other users to join the lobby. If youve ever played Call of Duty or any similar game, its the same concept. p  pMuch of this process currently works properly. p  pI created a collection called codeLobbycode to keep track of all the open and closed lobbies. When a user wants to host a lobby, he clicks on the button, which creates a new lobby and redirects the user to the proper urlp  precodeTemplate.lobby.events   click buttonhostlobby e,t gt     lobbyId  Lobby.insert       host Meteor.user.id       hostName Meteor.user.username       status true       players []     Router.gocurrentLobby, id lobbyId codepre  pThen, the user can invite other users to the lobby url through a modal, which adds a notification object to the invited users profile. Probably not the best way to do it, so Im open to suggestions on this front.p  precodeTemplate.playerItem.events   click button e,t gt     lobbyId  Session.get currentLobby     Meteor.call sendNotification, id, lobbyId, Meteor.user.username     Lobby.update       id lobbyId     ,       addToSet         invitedPlayers id codepre  pAnd the methodp  precodeMeteor.methods   sendNotification userId, lobbyId, hostName gt     sendTo  Meteor.users.findOneid userId     Meteor.users.update       id userId     ,       push         invite           hostName hostName           lobbyId lobbyId codepre  pSo at this point, the user can either accept or decline the invitation. If he accepts, he is routed to the lobby and is added to the codeplayerscode array in the lobby object. The user shows up in the list of players as one would expect. p  pMy issue starts when I attempt to start the game. When the button is clicked, the game is created properly and the host who pressed the button is routed to the url for the new gamep  precodeTemplate.currentLobby.events   click startgame e,t gt     playerIds  [host]     players.forEach player gt       playerIds.pushplayer.id     Meteor.call createGame, playerIds     Router.gohome codepre  pThe problem is that the other users in the lobby are not redirected. They have access to the game if they manually go to the url, but they arent taken there. They have no way of knowing that the game has actually started... p  pOne solution is to add a Game has started badge, with a link to the game, but I think a more elegant solution is to route all of the users at the current lobby url to the game that was just started. p  pIs this functionality possible Is there a better way to host a lobbyp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThank you Chet for the solution. This is how I eventually implemented itp  precodeTemplate.currentLobby.rendered  gt   autorun gt     data  Template.currentData     if data.url       Router.go data.url codepre  pcodeautoruncode had some context difficulties, so I just used the lobby data. Then, when someone clicks on the start game button, the current lobby is updated with the url of the new game The Meteor.call createGame returns the id of the new game.p  precodeTemplate.currentLobby.events   click startgame e,t gt     playerIds  [host]     lobbyId  Template.currentData.id      players.forEach player gt       playerIds.pushplayer.id      Meteor.call createGame, playerIds, err, res gt       Lobby.update         id lobbyId       ,         set           url gameres codepre  pWorks like a charm.

Negative 2990 pIn C and C, when you call codeTerminateThreadcode Windows or codepthreadkillcode Linux, it can leak allocated resource which were not freed before such an abrupt thread death.

The code is as followsp  precodehomefeaturedportfolio orderbyrandom limit1     ltdiv classfeaturedproductgt         lth3gtView Our Portfoliolth3gt         ltdiv classviewhovgtView Portfolioltdivgt         portfoliolandingpageimage limit1             expceimgsingle srcurl width220 height178 cropyes alttitle         portfoliolandingpageimage              ltpgtlta hrefurltitlepathportfoliogtltspan classdescriptiongttitleltspangtltagtltpgt     ltdivgt homefeaturedportfolio codepre  pIve played around with it and found that as soon as codeportfoliolandingpagecode is present inside the codehomefeaturedportfoliocode, the latter tag doesnt parse and the call for an image in the codeportfoliolandingpagecode doesnt work.p  pIf codeportfoliolandingpagecode is removed from inside put just above for instance, the outer codehomefeaturedproductcode parses correctly. The codeportfoliolandingpagecode however produces no content. p  pNo matter where I put the codeportfoliolandingpagecode tag pair I am unable to get it to render the image. p  pIve checked using template debugging and nothing looks unusual there. p  pSetupp  pcodehomefeaturedportfoliocode is a playa field inside a channel group called homepage The field options in this playa field are set to channel portfolio The channel group portfolio contains the field codeportfoliolandingpageimagecode which is an assets field. p  pThis is probably really simple  but any pointers would be much appreciated.p
Negative 2990 pI built myself a personal blog and part of what I wanted to do was include a spotify play button for a song of my choosing per blog post. p  pI was reading through the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.spotify.comtechnologieswidgetstermsofuse relnofollowspotify widget terms of usea and under Section V Users amp Data on item 5 it says I need to have a an end user agreement and privacy policy.p  pIve never looked into adding either an end user agreement or privacy policy to a project.

Negative 2990 h1Backgroundh1  pI am working on a C program which currently runs Node via Process.Start. I am capturing the stdout and stderr from this child process and redirecting it for my own reasons. I am looking into replacing the invocation of Node.exe with a call to Edge.js instead. In order to be able to do this I must be able to reliably capture stdout and stderr from the Javascript running within Edge, and get the messages back into my C application.p  h1Approach 1h1  pIll describe this approach for completeness in case anybody recommends it  p  pIf the Edge process terminates, it is fairly easy to deal with this by simply declaring a codemsgscode array and overwriting codeprocess.stdout.writecode and codeprocess.stderr.writecode with new functions that accumulate messages on that array, then at the end, simply return the codemsgscode array. Examplep  precodevar msgs  [] process.stdout.write  function string      msgs.push stream o, message  string   process.stderr.write  function string      msgs.push stream e, message string     Return to caller. var result   messages msgs ...other stuff...  callbacknull, result codepre  pObviously this only works if the Edge code terminates, and msgs may grow large in the worst case. However, it is likely to perform well because only one marshalling call is necessary to get all the messages back.p  h1Approach 2h1  pThis is a little harder to explain. Instead of accumulating messages, we hook stdout and stderr using a delegate we send in from C. In the C, we create an object that we will pass into Edge, and that object has a property called codestdoutHookcodep  precodedynamic payload  new ExpandoObject payload.stdoutHook  GetStdoutHook  public Funcltobject, Taskltobjectgtgt GetStdoutHook      Funcltobject, Taskltobjectgtgt hook  message gt              TheLogger.LogMessagemessage as string.Trim         return Task.FromResultltobjectgtnull           return hook  codepre  pI could really get away with an Action, but Edge appears to require the codeFuncltobject, Taskltobjectgtgtcode, it wont proxy the function otherwise. Then, in the Javascript, we can detect that function and use it like thisp  precodevar func  Edge.Func     return functionpayload, callback          if typeof payload.stdoutHook  function              process.stdout.write  payload.stdoutHook                    do lots of stuff while stdout and stderr are hooked...         var what  requirewhatever         what.futz           terminate.         callbacknull, result   dynamic result  funcpayload.Result codepre  h1Questionsh1  pQ1. Both of these techniques seem to work, but is there a better way of doing this, something builtin to Edge perhaps that I have missed Both solutions are invasive  they require some shim code to wrap the actual work that is to be done in Edge. This is not the end of the world, but it would be better if there was a noninvasive method.p  pQ2.

Negative 2990 pI am having trouble with this bsearch. Im pretty sure that Ive isolated the problem to the number of bytes parameter that bsearch takes in. The data array is a scrabble dictionary and Im 100 sure that the entire dictionary is loaded into memory, but when I use bsearch to try to find if a particular word is in the dictionary, it only works for words before wontedly even though the dictionarys last word is zzz so some words starting with w x y and z are not able to be found. Its almost as if the bsearch function can not see the end of the array, even though its there. Another thing of note is that in my comparison function i print out what bsearch has passed to it to see what words are being compared, and it seems that on the first comparison, bsearch does not send the middle value which is something like lunkheads, instead, it is starting at lodge which is not the middle word in the dictionary. 16 bytes is the number I put in, through trial and error that seems to work. The issue is that I do not know what the length of each element in the array is, or at least I think thats the issue.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltassert.hgt include ltstring.hgt  define LEN 128    int searchconst void usrword,const void words  struct datat      int nval        current number of values in array      int max         allocated number of values      char data         the data array    enum INIT  1, GROW  2  int mainvoid      FILE fp  fopenscrabble.txt, r     assertfp     char usrword  NULL     char buf[LEN]     int i  0     char number[LEN]     char item  NULL       struct datat data  mallocsizeofstruct datat     datagtnval  INIT     datagtmax  INIT     datagtdata  NULL     while fgetsbuf, LEN, fp              if datagtdata  NULL                      datagtdata  mallocstrlenbuf  1                     assertdatagtdata                          else if datagtnval gt datagtmax                      datagtdata  reallocdatagtdata, GROW  datagtmax  LEN                     assertdatagtdata                     datagtmax  GROW  datagtmax                           datagtdata[i]  strndupbuf, strlenbuf  1             i             datagtnval           overcounted      datagtnval     printfEnter word      fgetsbuf, LEN, stdin     usrword  strndupbuf, strlenbuf1      search for word     item  char  bsearchusrword, datagtdata[0], datagtnval, 16, search     if item  NULL             printfns is validn, item     else if item  NULL            printfns is not validn, usrword      return 0   int searchconst void usrword,const void words         printfs  s  dn, char usrword,char   words, strcmpusrword,words     return strcmpusrword,words  codepre

Negative 2990 pI am coding a realtime, network program with UDP protocol using SFML libraries. The server will be handling all of the processing, sending packets to  the client and vice versa.p  pI need a method to synchronize the screen updates, because there will be a realtime user interface on both sides of the network. What I am thinking is, I will have the client and server open two ports, 1 for sending the packet and the other as a sort of verifying port.p  pOnce the updates are made and verified, both loops will send a byte over the network indicating that their side is ready. Once a ready side receives that byte, it will know the screen is ready to update on both sides, and then render the updates.p  pMy question is, how would I do this in C using SFML libraries. Is the logic correct, will I encounter network errors etc.p  pComment if anything needs clearing up.p

Negative 2990 pI have an unsorted vector of doubles Actually objects with a double member which is used in this case. From this vector I need to remove the smallest nonunique value. However, it is not guaranteed that a nonunique value exists. It is allowed to sort the range.p  pAs always I started with looking for an stdalgorithm and found stdunique. In my first idea I would use this in combination with stdsort to move all nonunique values to the end of the vector and then use minelement over the nonunique values. However, stdunique will leave the nonunique values at the end in an unspecified state. And indeed I lost all non POD members.p  pDoes anyone have a suggestion how to do this efficiently It is important to do it efficiently since the code is used in the bottleneck of the program which is already a bit too slow.p

Negative 2990 pThis is probably a simple fix but I want to make sure I am doing this correctly. p  pBasically I just want to be able to change the location or order of a widget on a page.  Specifically I was using the recent posts widget to display the last 5 posts on my home page.  The theme Im using only has three areas for widgets emSidebar, Front Page, and Footerem. p  pThe problem is that Front Page widget is the first thing that appears on the page instead of the last.  I want the recent posts to appear after all the normal content on the page.  Right now it shows up as my nav bar, then the recent posts widget, then everything else thats supposed to be first on my home page.p

Negative 2990 pIm making a voting app in Java using Eclipse where the user votes for their favorite team. Right now I have a local MySQLite database that I am managing with the MySQLite Firefox extension. The votes are stored in the MySQLite database, then I have another java application that reads from the database and outputs the name of the team that got more votes. However, I would like to store this database online, so multiple people can vote at once, then the results are displayed. How can I go about doing this I am guessing that I will need PHP, but I am having a hard time finding a tutorial on how to integrate a MySQLite database with PHP. I pretty much just need to store my database online. Everything is functional locally.    p
Negative 2990 pOK, my general setup for using codePreferenceFragmentcode seems to be correct, however, I am trying to read in a value from my codeSharedPreferencescode on startup. That value would be mapped to an codeEnumcode that I created. p  pMy first approach dealt with getting the index as codeStringcode of the codestringarraycode my stringarray values. So I would get the Index as a string and convert it to an codeIntegercode. Then I would get all my codestringarraycode strings, and grab the one at the correct index. From there I would do an codeEnum.valueOfStringcode. Volia...done.p  pThis seemed like a lot of overhead, and I thought I could get rid of all the  codeIndexcode middleman stuff.

When in the Developer tools on Chrome, I can see the jQuery is doing its job correctly, adding and removing the class at the right time, just the CSS doesnt seem to work.p  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodedocument.readyfunction           var stickyNavTop  nav.offset.top          var stickyNav  function                   var scrollTop  window.scrollTop                  if scrollTop gt stickyNavTop                           nav.addClasssticky                       else                           nav.removeClasssticky                                 stickyNav          window.scrollfunction          stickyNav      codepre pre classsnippetcodecss langcss prettyprintoverridecode      margin 0     padding 0     fontfamily Helvetice Neue, sansserif   fontface      fontfamily Helvetica Neue     src url..fontsHelveticaNeue.otf   html, body      width 100     height 100   divcontainer      width 100     height 100   divcontent      width 100     height 100   sectionmainbg      width 100     height 100   mainbg img      width 100     height 100     position fixed     zindex 9999  always on bottom    nav      width 100     height 60px     bottom 60px     backgroundcolor 333333    nav  .sticky      position fixed   nav ul      float right   nav ul li      float left     marginleft 40px     liststyle none   nav ul li a      textdecoration none     color white     padding 20px     lineheight 60px   divcontent      width 100     height 2000px     backgroundcolor dedede     bottom 0 codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt     ltheadgt          lttitlegtJosh Murray  My Personal Pagelttitlegt             ltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, heightdevicewidth, userscalableno, initialscale1gt         ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefcssmainstyles.cssgt         ltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery2.1.4jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscript srcscriptshomemadeSticky.jsgtltscriptgt          ltheadgt          ltbodygt                  ltdiv idcontainergt                                  ltsection rolebanner idmainbggt                                          lt this is where the full screen image will be gt                                          ltimg srcimgbg.jpggt                                      ltsectiongt                                  ltnavgt                                          ltulgt                                                  ltligtlta hrefgtHomeltagtltligt                         ltligtlta hrefgtProductsltagtltligt                         ltligtlta hrefgtAboutltagtltligt                         ltligtlta hrefgtContactltagtltligt                                              ltulgt                                      ltnavgt                                  ltdiv idcontentgt                                          lt content in here gt                                      ltdivgt                      ltdivgt              ltbodygt  lthtmlgtcodepre div div p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 2990 pI have a working website at example.com that is stored in my S3. I bought my domain from google so it was a bit of trouble, but I transferred all my MX,CNAME, and other records. Now I have one hosted zone called codeexample.comcode, inside it are all of these said records, plus amazons default codeSOAcode and codeNScode records.

So I deleted this record and created an Alias with the name codewww.example.comcode and then connected it to my S3. I know my S3 works because I checked the links that S3 provides.p  pIt has been 12 hours and I still see no change in the behavior of looking up codewww.example.comcode. I should also note that I was fiddling around and created a new hosted zone for my codewww.example.comcode and followed the configuration and even added the 4 pieces of NS to my original DNS provider. I soon deleted them when I figured out this wasnt the correct method. p  pPlease let me know of any suggestions. Thank you. p

Negative 2990 pI have been actively developing a a hrefhttpsgithub.combaseball435NitroNet relnofollownetworking librarya called NitroNet over the past year now and am looking to get ideas on how to securely distinguish between multiple clients sockets connected to a server on the same machine. p  pI have been developing the library using Java and I currently have it distinguishing between clients using the clients UDP port as the unique identifier. This works fine but Im not convinced that it is the most secure way to actually distinguish between them. So I want to know, is there a better more secure way to truly distinguish between themp  pWhen I say I need to distinguish between them I mean that when a packet is received from a client on the serverside I need to be able to get the corresponding connection instance on the server side using only the information from the socket. I dont want any ID numbers being stored on the actual client for fear of reverse engineering and manually changing the ID. Any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.p
