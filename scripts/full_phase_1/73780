Negative 73780 pI am not sure what I should be doing here. Should I be hardcoding all the values in or should I have them in a CONST variables.

If this happened then I would add the error to the ModelState with an error message that I wrote.p  pso in my unit test I want to make sure that if a blank form variable is submitted that it gets caught.p  pnow in my unit testing I just made a CONST varible and copied in and pasted the validation message in.p  pSo in my assert I compare what the actual message is compared to the message stored in my CONST Varrible. I do this by calling like the Model state and call the field up where I expect the error to be.p  pLike p  presult.ViewData.ModelState[username].Errors[0]p  pSo if the message is there then it must have gone into my code otherwise it would not exist.p  pSo it occurred to me maybe I should make a new class that will be static and hold all these CONST variables.p  pThat way both the controller views and the unit tests can use them. That way if I got to change the error message then I only need to change it one place. Since I am not testing what the error message is I am testing if it gets set.p  pThe same thing say for exceptions I have some custom messages but I am not testing if the message is right, more if the expection got caught. p  pThe way I am testing it though is to see if the message is the message that I expect since if it is not the message or the message does not exist then something went wrong.p  pI am new to unit testing so I wanted to make sure that what I am going to do wont some how screw up my unit tests.p  pTo me it makes sense but I thought better check first. p  pThanksp

Negative 73780 pLets assume weve build a system with a DI framework which is working quite fine. This system currently uses JMS to talk with other systems not maintained by us. The majority of our customers like the JMS approach and uses it according to our specification. The component which does all the messaging is injected with Spring into the rest of the application. p  pNow we got the case that one customer cannot implement the JMS solution and want to use another messaging technology. Thats not a problem because we can simply implement a messaging service using this technology and inject it in the rest of the application. p  pBut how are we supposed to handle the deployment and maintenance of the configuration Since the application uses Spring i could imagine to check in all the configurations i have for this application and the system administrator could start the application and passing the name of the DI XML file to specify which configuration should be loaded. But... it just dont feel right. Are there any solutions for such cases available What are the bestpractices you use I could even imagine more complex scenarios which do not contain only one service substitution...p  pThanks a lotp

A Python program should wait and watch for events like those above to occur, then dispatch the appropriate routine. p  pIs there a Python module which is appropriate for detecting events like those above Or, as a more general question, how can I replace emlaunchdem in this setting using Python and possibly AppleScript via the AppScript bridge Sorry if the question is rather vague. Reading suggestions are also appreciated.p

Negative 73780 pIm working on what is turning out to be a fairly complex SELECT query.  I have several hierarchical queries being nested in a single SELECT and it is getting to be quite difficult to manage.p  pIm running into a few places where my inline views need to be executed in more than one place, so it seems like a reasonable idea to execute those once at the beginning of a stored procedure and then do some iteration over the results as needed.p  pIm wondering if there are any reasons why I should not, or could not, execute an Oracle Stored Procedure, called via my PHP code, and return as an OUT parameter the resultset.  Ive tended to use SPs only to do updatesdeletesinserts but the sheer size and complexity of this query seems like it needs to be broken down.p  pIf there arent any technical problems with this, any comments on whether it is good or bad practicep
Negative 73780 pHopefully someone has been down this road before and can offer some sound advice as far as which direction I should take. I am currently involved in a project in which we will be utilizing a custom database to store data extracted from excel files based on preestablished templates to maintain consistency. We currently have a process written in C.Net 2008 that can extract the necessary data from the spreadsheets and import it into our custom database. What I am primarily interested in is figuring out the best method for integrating that process with our portal. What I would like to do is let SharePoint keep track of the metadata about the spreadsheet itself and let the custom database keep track of the data contained within the spreadsheet. So, one thing I need is a way to link spreadsheets from SharePoint to the custom database and vice versa. As these spreadsheets will be updated periodically, I need tried and true way of ensuring that the data remains synchronized between SharePoint and the custom database. I am also interested in finding out how to use the data from the custom database to create reports within the SharePoint portal. Any and all information will be greatly appreciated.p

As the user performs actions in the main window the side window is updated. For example if you clicked page down in the main window a listbox in the side window would page down.p  pRight now the architecture for this application feels very messy and Im sure there is a cleaner way to do it. It looks like thisp  pMain Window contains a singleton SideWindowControl which communicates with an instance of the SideWindowDisplay using events  so, for example, the pagedown button would work likep  p1 the event handler of the button on the main window calls SideWindowControl.PageDownp  p2 in the PageDown function a event is created and thrown.p  p3 finally the gui, ShowSideWindowDisplay is subscribing to the SideWindowControl.Actions event handles the event and actually scrolls the listbox down  note because it is in a different thread it has to do that by running the command via Dispatcher.Invokep  pThis just seems like a very messy way to this and there must be a clearer way The only part that cant change is that the main window and the side window must be on different threads. Perhaps using WPF commands p  pId really appreciate any suggestions Thanksp

Negative 73780 pWhen testing my iPhone app I have found it incredibly useful to log information to the console window.  I think it is amazing that I can send out an adhoc build to my coworkers and if they experience problems I am able to plug their iPhone into my mac and grab their console output.  However, sometimes the console window is blank when we do this.  Why is this the case  The code has been built with logging enabled.  Besides that, it seems that the console output, when I see it, contains information about not only my app, but other iphone system logging.p  pThanks for any insight you can provide.p

Negative 73780 pWhy does C have codepubliccode members that anyone can call and codefriendcode declarations that expose emallem codeprivatecode members to emgivenem foreign classes or methods but offer no syntax to expose particular members to given callersp  pI want to express interfaces with some routines to be invoked only by known callers without having to give those callers complete access to all privates, which feels like a reasonable thing to want.  The best I could come up with myself below and suggestions by others so far revolve around idiomspattern of varying indirectness, where I really just want a way to have emsingleem, simple class definitions that explicitly indicate what callers more granularly than emmeem, emmy childrenem, or emabsolutely anybodyem can access which members.  What is the best way to express the concept belowp  precode Can I grant YusesX... selective Xrestricted... access more cleanly void YusesXint n, X x, int m    XAttorneyYrestrictedx, n   struct X    class AttorneyY           Proxies restricted state to part or all of Y. private   void restrictedint      Something preferably selectively available.   friend class AttorneyY    Give trusted member class private access.   int personal             Truly private state ...    Single abstract permission.  Can add more friends or forwards. class XAttorneyY    friend void YusesXint, X , int   inline static void restrictedX ampx, int n  x.restrictedn   codepre  pIm nowhere near being a software organization guru, but it feels like interface simplicity and the principle of least privilege are directly at odds in this aspect of the language.  A clearer example for my desire might be a codePersoncode class with declared methods like codetakePillMedicine code codetellTheTruthcode and codeforfeitDollarsunsigned intcode that only codePhysiciancode, codeJudgecode, or codeTaxMancode instancesmember methods, respectively, should even consider invoking.  Needing onetime proxy or interface classes for each major interface aspect sits ill with me, but please speak up if you know Im missing something.p  pstrongAnswer accepted from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers23934drewhallDrew Halla a hrefhttpwww.drdobbs.com184402053Dr Dobbs  Friendship and the AttorneyClient Idiomastrongp  pThe code above originally called the wrapper class Proxy instead of Attorney and used pointers instead of references but was otherwise equivalent to what Drew found, which I then deemed the best generally known solution.  Not to pat myself on the back too hard...  I also changed the signature of restricted to demonstrate parameter forwarding.  The overall cost of this idiom is one class and one friend declaration per permission set, one friend declaration per set approved caller, and one forwarding wrapper per exposed method per permission set.  Most of the better discussion below revolves around the forwarding call boilerplate that a very similar Key idiom avoids at the expense of less direct protection.p

Negative 73780 pIm trying to get what I call measurement units system by wrapping double into struct. I have C structures like Meter, Second, Degree, etc. My original idea was that after compiler is inlined everything I would have a performance the same as if double were used.p  pMy explicit and implicit operators are simple and straightforward, and compiler does actually inline them, yet the code with Meter and Second is 10 times slower than the same code using double.p  pMy question is being why cannot C compiler make the code using Second as optimal as the code using double if it inlines everything anywayp  pSecond is defined as followingp  precodestruct Second      double value  no more fields.      public static Second operator  Second left, Second right                return left.value  right.value           public static implicit Second operator double value                 This seems to be faster than having constructor          return new Second  value  value             plenty of similar operators  codepre  pUpdatep  pI didnt ask if struct fits here. It does.p  pI didnt ask if code is going to be inlined. JIT does inline it.p  pI checked assembly operations emitted in runtime. They were different for code like thisp  precodevar x  new double for var i  0 i lt 1000000 i       x  x  2      Many other simple operator calls here  codepre  pand like thisp  precodevar x  new Second for var i  0 i lt 1000000 i       x  x  2      Many other simple operator calls here  codepre  pThere were no call instructions in disassembly, so operations were in fact inlined. Yet the difference is significant. Performance tests show that using Second is like 10 times slower than using double.p  pSo my questions are attention why is JIT generated IA64 code is different for the cases above What can be done to make struct run as fast as double It seems there no theoretical difference between double and Second, what is the deep reason of difference I sawp

Negative 73780 pIm trying to implement a lowpass filter for an iphone app where I record a sound and then it gets played back slightly muffled like the voice is coming from another room. p  pIve looked into the different options for audio recording and manipulation and have found it a bit confusing...digital signal processing isnt a strong point at all. Ive mainly looked into OpenAL and inside the EFX library there is a filter that specifically does what I need, but EFX is not included on the iPhone. Is there a way of replicating that behaviour using OpenAL for the iPhone Is there another option such as Audio Units that could provide a solutionp  pThanks for your helpp  pEDITp  pSo after Toms answer and links, Ive come up with what I think is a correct implementation. However, Im not getting a muffling effect at all, rather just a decrease in volume. Heres the summarised code I have currentlyp  pFile is recorded using AVAudioRecorder and the following settingsp  precode[recordSetting setValue [NSNumber numberWithIntkAudioFormatLinearPCM] forKeyAVFormatIDKey] [recordSetting setValue[NSNumber numberWithFloat44100] forKeyAVSampleRateKey] [recordSetting setValue[NSNumber numberWithInt 1] forKeyAVNumberOfChannelsKey]  [recordSetting setValue [NSNumber numberWithInt16] forKeyAVLinearPCMBitDepthKey] [recordSetting setValue [NSNumber numberWithBoolNO] forKeyAVLinearPCMIsBigEndianKey] [recordSetting setValue [NSNumber numberWithBoolNO] forKeyAVLinearPCMIsFloatKey] codepre  pI then read in the file and transform it with the code belowp  precode Read in the file using AudioFileOpenURL AudioFileID fileID  [self openAudioFilefilePath]   find out how big the actual audio data is UInt32 fileSize  [self audioFileSizefileID]   allocate the memory to hold the file SInt16  outData  SInt16 mallocfileSize    Read in the file to outData OSStatus result  noErr result  AudioFileReadBytesfileID, false, 0, ampfileSize, outData   close off the file AudioFileClosefileID   Allocate memory to hold the transformed values SInt16  transformData  SInt16 mallocfileSize   Start the transform  Need to set alpha to 0.15 or below to have a noticeable affect float alpha  1            Code as per Toms example transformData[0]  outData[0]  forint sample  1 sample lt fileSize  sizeofSInt16 sample         transformData[sample]  transformData[sample  1]  alpha  outData[sample]  transformData[sample  1]    Add the data to OpenAL buffer NSUInteger bufferID  grab a buffer ID from openAL alGenBuffers1, ampbufferID   Add the audio data into the new buffer alBufferDatabufferID,ALFORMATMONO16,transformData,fileSize,44100 codepre  pSo after all that, I then play it through OpenAL using the standard method I dont think it has any impact on my results so I wont include it here.p  pIve traced through the results, both before and after transform, and they seem correct to me i.e. the values before vary positively and negatively as I would expect and the for loop is definitely flattening out those values.

Negative 73780 pRelating to my earlier question regarding a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5166723annotatecodeinvs2010withoutchangingthatcodeAnnotate code in VS 2010 without changing that codea.  I have decided to try my hand at writing an extension for Visual Studio to allow the annotation of code under review without changing the code itself.  My primary requirement here is to anchor annotation data to code elements, literal lines of code in the simplest sense, blocks of code or statements in a more complex sense.  p  pI can subdivide this requirement into a logic part and a UI part, where UI part will provide a visual indication that a code element has been annotated, together with a means of accessing the annotations for that code, and a logic part, that identifies and tracks the code element through various changes made to the code that contains that element.  In my simple case of a line of code, this would have to track updates such as incrementing the line number when I line is added above the annotated line, etc.p  pWhat mechanisms are at my disposal, via the VS Extensibility API, for fulfilling mainly my logic requirement, and how do I go about getting started using thesep

Negative 73780 pThere are several examples of how to populate a tree view from a collection of file paths such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions673931filesystemtreeviewthisa or a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2436201howtomakeatreeviewfromadatabasecolumnfilepaththis othera example. I cannot seem to find such example for WPF. I know I can integrate windows forms and use a different control in order to make it work but it will be nice if I could do the same thing with a wpf treeview control. The tree view that I want to construct consists of about 50,000 files therefore I think it will be better if it is bind it to something.

Negative 73780 pI read several threads on serialization I found here, but they did not answer my question.p  pI need a simple serialization library, that would reflect over the properties marked with certain attribute and store their values as a string. All the properties are either directly strings or directly convertable to and from string builtin value types, bool, etc.. It should also understand simple containers like generic lists and serialize those content.p  pThe control I need over the serialization is to indicate what properties are to be serialized only those decorated with an attribute and I also must be able to indicate that certain properties are serialized as the last ones during serialization they must be also deserialized as the last ones.p  pThe format does not matter, just normal codeparam1val1, param2val2code would do, JSON would also do, as well as XML or even escaped or encoded binary format. Important is that I can have all my settings in one string I can easily store and load in my application.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 73780 pFor a school project, were supposed to create a multiplayer game in Java it should be clientserver which can be played over the internet were programming this at school, so its not homework. The game is turnbased, but there should be a chat, which ofcourse is realtime. However, none of us has experience with network programming and the more I read about it, the more questions I seem to have.p  pMy first thought was to use the socket API to implement the multiplayer part. The server waits for new data from the clients. However, there are multiple kinds of data to receive, like chat messages, movement, etc. Also, once the connection to the server is made, some initial data like the Players name should be sent. The server should be able to see what kind of message it received, but how I was thinking of creating a class codeMessagecode with a string field codetypecode. But in my server code, I will get code like thisp  precodeif message.type.equalsmessage     code to execute for chat messages  else if message.type.equalsmovement     code to execute for movement  else if      ...  else     ...   Please ignore syntax errors P codepre  pWhen there are a lot of different kinds of data to send and there WILL be, this doesnt look like the most efficient way. Also, this would mean both the server and client should have this Messageclassinterface duplicate code.p  pWhat about other game stuff For example, player 1 moves his character to a position which defeats another character. The client of player 1 calculates this defeatment and applies the correct actions. But what should be send to the server Just the new player position or also the defeatment With the first option, it means all other clients should do the calculations. Couldnt this cause any trouble As I have no prior network programming experience, Im a bit confused on how to do all these things.p  pIve also read in another thread here on Stackoverflow that RMI might be a better option. Having read some information about this, I understand what RMI is, but Im still not able to see whether it is a good option for this project or not.  Any tips for thisp  pAs you see, Im a bit confused on how to start with the networking part of this project. Ive searched for some game programming books for Java ofcourse, but none of them are focussed on the networking part. Ive also searched for Java networking books, but these seem to be focussed on the technology, not on good code practices. p  pIf anyone knows a good book or has some advice in the right diection, it would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanksp

This code works fine the first time through. If I go to my facebook applications permissions page in Facebook and remove the app that is, remove its permissions, while my desktop app here is NOT running, when I do start it up, it sees that it does not have permission and shows the login dialog. I can save the accesskey and it will work just fine. But if I go to the facebook apps page and yank the permissions while my desktop app is running, then bad things happen. I get an error message about the activex control cannot be instantiated because the current thread is not in a singlethreaded apartment. I have seen many posts here that say all you have to do is put [STAThread] above your main, and my code has that. I have also tried creating a new thread to call the FacebookLoginDialog, but not only did that not work, but since my code is really not designed to run in multiple threads, that started causing more problems.p  pIs there a simple solution to all this, or do I need to redesign my code so that it properly runs in multiple threads Or should I just live with the program crashing in those few instances when someone monkeys with the facebook permissions while my app is runningp

Negative 73780 pI like the constructor injection of CDI a lot but now I found a usecase where constructor injection apparently doesnt work as expected.p  pIn my example I have two classes.

Negative 73780 pIve got a a few codeUIScrollViewcode on a page. You can scroll them independently or lock them together and scroll them as one. The problem occurs when they are locked.p  pI use codeUIScrollViewDelegatecode and codescrollViewDidScrollcode to track movement. I query the codecontentOffsetcode of the codeUIScrollViewcode which changed and then reflect change to other scroll views by setting their codecontentOffsetcode property to match.p  pGreat.... except I noticed a lot of extra calls. Programmatically changing the codecontentOffsetcode of my scroll views triggers the delegate method codescrollViewDidScrollcode to be called. Ive tried using codesetContentOffsetanimatedcode instead, but Im still getting the trigger on the delegate.p  pHow can I modify my contentOffsets programmatically to not trigger codescrollViewDidScrollcodep  pImplementation notes.... Each codeUIScrollViewcode is part of a custom codeUIViewcode which uses delegate pattern to call back to the presenting codeUIViewControllercode subclass that handles coordinating the various codecontentOffsetcode values.p

But it doesnt contain any music in itself.

Negative 73780 pIm here for a bit of advice. Im using Hibernate with Java. Ive implemented a controller interface to distance the User interface from the actual communication with the database. For the given interface Ive implemented a database controller class that does the actual communication. This is fed to the user interface by a static controller factory. p  pNow I discover that the Hibernate doesnt actually load everything I want into the memory. For each controller method call Im always opening session, doing my stuff, closing the session. Therefore when I try to access my object structure Im prompted with error thatp  precodecould not initialize proxy  no Session codepre  pWith little effort and googling I concluded that the object to which my active object is referencing is not in the memory.p  pNow I have an option to keep the session open from the moment I start using my objects to the end. But it seems a bit redundant and energy inefficient. I guess I wont lose much by keeping the session open, but I kind of intended to keep the user interface purely out oh the database business. Having my controller interface to have a tearDown and setUp method for the user interface seems a bit against given logic. p

Negative 73780 pI want to know what differenceor rather advantage does GIT gives when doing local commits emcommit commandem as compared to just saving the changes in the working directory in SVN strongwhen working offline not connected to serverstrongp  pI have read that GIT gives an advantage of working offline i.e. user can perform commits locally as many times as he wants to and then when the user is connected to the server, she can push the changes to remote server.

Ive successfully implemented the above but while the app is busy making creating a new doc at google docs for that time being the newly loaded forms UI freezes. I read somewhere that this can be avoided if I use multi threading. So now I wanna ask should I create two threads and in one of them I should place the code for creating new form and in the other one I should place the code to create a document in google doc.

Negative 73780 pAfter spending quite a bit of time trying to design my way around the existing javax.sound.sampled library for simple but relatively timeaccurate capturerendering of audio, Im concluding that I really need to get to the native audio API. The problem Ive found is that I need to be able to get frame position of sound that Im rendering by writing to a SourceDataLine in increments of 20 or 50 milliseconds, accurate to 1 or 2 milliseconds. In other words, I want to synchronize some graphical events to audio that is playing, with a video frame rate of 20 to 50 fps, with jitter no greater than 1 or 2 millseconds. It seems that the JavaSound implementation is too far from the hardware a price to pay for platform independence for this. After much tinkering with SDLTDL buffer sizes, audio formats, size of SDL.write and TDL.read buffers, frequency of writing, etc, I cant find a way to avoid the variation in the frame position reported compared to the system clock at 1 millisecond resolution, not microseconds.p  p[Further clarification I could just let the graphical rendering run at a fixed rate based on the system clock, which would be accurate enough for my needs. However, if this is to be synchronized with an audio track, by the time a typical audio track 5 minutes long, for instance neared the end even small time differences will acccumulate to a noticeable time difference between audio and graphics. I thought to just check for synchronization every second or 2 or 5, but the jitter from the reported audio frame position would result in corrections that would then be noticeable.]p  pIve been researching what libraries might already be available. It seems many of the existing packages are targeted to support the game development community. However, I dont need 3D audio, hardware acceleration of effects, synthesis, processing  just a way to read the frame position of what is being heard with a consistent latency. If the latency was as much as 100 milliseconds, but consistent, I could design around that.p  pI would appreciate recommendations for Java libraries providing this type of capability. I presume it will be JNI wrappers of a native audio API. I only need to support Windows7 at this point. Ive seen OpenAL seems to be Creatives open way of supporting hardware acceleration of audio since now no longer supported in Vista  gameoriented and more than I need, JSyn focusing on synthesis, MIDI, not a simple sampled interface and JAsioHost most promising so far.p  pIf there are ways around the limitations Ive noted with the JavaSound API, that would also be fine, but Ive just about given up after a week of effort.p  pThanks.p

So according to codeautomatic string interningcode, codescode should be pointed to the same memory address of codea new stringcode, rightp  pThen how can we say we create unnecessary objectsp

When Cocoa scripting invokes valueForKey to get a value, KVC automatically converts the value to an NSNumber object for scalars or NSValue object for structures if necessary. Similarly, setValueforKey determines the data type required by the appropriate accessor or instance variable for the specified key. If the data type is not an object, then the value is extracted from the passed object using the appropriate NSNumber orNSValue method. For more information, including a table of the supported types, see Scalar and Structure Support in KeyValue Coding Programming Guideemp  pStill, there are wrappers for structs like NSRect. There might be a way to override the original valueForKey so it could also handle Vec3f.p  pSo this would be the new question strongHow to override the emvalueForKeyem and emsetValue forKeyem so it would be able to handle my own c objectstrongp

Negative 73780 pI am using strongMarkdownstrong to render a rich content on a page, using PHP.

Negative 73780 pIve looked around at a few different postings but havent been able to find an answer to my problem. Recently I realized I wasnt using ESTRICT in my errorreporting, so I added errorreportingEALL  ESTRICT and have been going through debugging errors that I find.p  pThe problem I am facing now is with errorreportingEALL  ESTRICT some of the pages wont load at all, I am given a white screen with no errors and no information as to what is wrong. If I use simply errorreportingEALL from the errorreporting everything loads fine..p  pI have the same errorreporting set up in my php.ini as well as my website.p  pstrongI was also able to figure out exactly where the script was breaking on an includeonce for a file that does exist.strongp  pI suppose I could survive with just using EALL as I have been up until now, but I am curious as to what the major problems are. Any help is much appreciatedp

Negative 73780 pSometimes while initializing variables, you want to pass them values that are too complex to be computed in a single command, so you usually either compute a dummy variable before and then pass its value, or define a function elsewhere, and pass its return value to our variable.p  pMy question wish is, is it possible instead compute to a variable on the fly using anonymous functionsp  pfor example, instead of use thisp  precodepost  getpost id  postgtID  array  array     foo gt hi,     bar gt id  codepre  pLets  use something like thisp  precodearray  array     foo gt hi,     bar gt function         post  getpost         return postgtID       codepre  pCode is totaly random.p

Negative 73780 pIm open to suggestions. Im writing an app that needs a music playing between all activities of the app, and pauses when the user hits home or exits the app by hitting back and getting out of my app. so heres what i did  i made a SoundController class that contains a static instance of MediaPlayer, like thisp  precodeprivate static MediaPlayer musicPlayer public static void initContext ctx     musicPlayer  new MediaPlayer     AssetFileDescriptor descriptor     try          descriptor  ctx.getAssets.openFdsomething.ogg         musicPlayer.setDataSourcedescriptor.getFileDescriptor, descriptor.getStartOffset,

   codepre  pand i call .start and .pause on each activitys onResume and onPause in my app like thisp  precodeOverride public void onResume     System.out.printlngot in onResume for mainActivity     SoundController.playMusic     super.onResume   Override public void onPause     System.out.printlngot in onPause for mainActivity     SoundController.pauseMusic     super.onPause   Override public void onDestroy     System.out.printlngot in onDestroy for mainActivity     SoundController.tearDown     super.onDestroy  codepre  pwhere the SoundController methods are likep  precodepublic static void playMusic     ifmusicPlayer.isPlaying         musicPlayer.start        public static void pauseMusic     ifmusicPlayer.isPlaying         musicPlayer.pause        public static void tearDown     ifmusicPlayer.isPlaying         musicPlayer.stop         musicPlayer.release       codepre  pbut for some reason, i am noticing several bugs likep  ul lithe music keeps playing even after the app exits, if i do things quick enough, like i start the app, hit home really quickly, then start the app again, and hit back key to exit the app...li lithe app crashes when trying to exit, because for some reason, the onPause gets called AFTER onDestroy.... someone please do enlighten me on this, i didnt even know this was possible. im logging it in my logcat, on kindle fireli ul  pIs it that my static instance of media player is somehow destroying before my app is destroyed p  pin the case where the music keeps playing long after my app exits, is it that the mediaPlayer.start has a delayed start, so it byPasses the check for when the app exitsp  psorry for the long post. thanks so muchp  pp  pemeditem heres the log for crashp  precode0912 144406.304 ISystem.out12191 got in onPause for

Negative 73780 pIf we compare ABAP field symbols and data references with the pointer in C, we observe p  pIn C, say we declare a variable var type integer with default value 5.p  pThe variable var will be stored some where in memory, and say the memory address which holds this variable is 1000.p  pNow we define a pointer ptr and this pointer is assigned to our variable.p  pSo, ptr will be 1000 and  ptr  will be 5.p  pLets compare the above situation in ABAP.p  pHere we declare a Field symbol FS and assign that to the variable var.p  pNow my question is what FS holds  I have searched this rigorously in the internet but found out many ABAP consultants have the opinion that FS holds the address of the variable i.e. 1000. But that is wrong. While debugging i found out that fs holds only 5. So fs in ABAP is equivalent to ptr in C. Please correct me if my understanding is wrong.p  pNow lets declare a data reference dref and another filed symbol fsym and after creating the data reference we assign the same to field symbol . Now we can do operations on this field symbol. So the difference between data refernec and field symbol is p  pin case of field symbol first we will declare a variable and assign it to a field symbol.p  pin case of data reference first we craete a data reference and then assign that to field symbol.p  pThen what is the use of data reference The same functionality we can achive through field symbol also.p

Negative 73780 pFirst, let me explain what I am doing. I have a CVS repository that I store 5,000 Data Definition Language files in. These 5,000 files are generated from an external data modeling application, they are text and have windows CRLFs. During development, if I need to make a change, I regenerate the 5,000 files and then overwrite the contents of my local CVS workspace in eclipse. The full overwritereplacement is to make sure that I dont miss any updates to files. After overwritingreplacing the files, I use eclipse to do a team lt synchronize with repository. When I do this, the comparison flags every single file as an outgoing change because it looks to not be ignoring CRLFs in its comparison. I have Ignore white space checked off and the eclipse documentation states that it should be ignoring CRLFsp  precode Ignore whitespace option  Causes the comparison to ignore differences which are whitespace characters   spaces, tabs, etc.. Also causes differences in line terminators  LF   versus CRLF to be ignored. codepre  pWhen I open the files in text compare, it shows no diffs but there is an extra CRLF at top of one of the files. Is this a bug or is there an option I am missing in eclipse It looks like the problem is that it doesnt ignore CRLFs that are on their own line.p

Negative 73780 pIm a security guy by day a coder by night and I usually write my tools in java. It was something I was taught in school so really its just the simple fact that Im comfortable writing in that language. p  pI have been for a few years now been limited by the inability to take a response from a server and build it up by actually running the JavaScript. This has drastically hurt my ability to do so many things like spider and simply see an actual response as if it was built in a browser. In order to compensate for this Weakness I have tried to use a number of different headless browsers. I tried JX browser, CORBA,SWT, HTML unit, etc. You name it I have tried to use it. As many of you know none of these technologies can even accurately handle some of the most simple JavaScript applications. Therefore, Im really looking for an alternative.p  pIve been looking into potentially using something like serverside JavaScript in order to render the HTML and manipulate the DOM. I was looking at things like Node.js,PhantomJS, etc. ideally I would like to be able to keep using my Java code and somehow use these technologies as a supplement for those headless browsers. However, it looks like being able to talk to these technologies will be difficult. It looks like I might be able to leverage the commandline with Java and write to files with those js technologies and read those files with my Java code. This does seem a little clunky so I thought maybe I should just flip over to fully using these to build my tools. I wanted to get others ideas or opinions on this. Just to give you an idea of what I typically need to do I need to be able to I need to build the send HTTP requests and get responses back,crawl sites, things like that.p  pIm really just looking to see if there are other options available or if Im going about this the right wayp

Negative 73780 pI am encountering an issue where nothing is rendered when running a simple OpenGL application through VS 2012 on Windows 8.p  pI had a little debug renderer I was using to prototype some projects and had it up and running on Windows 7 using VS 2012 Express Edition.p  pI upgraded to Windows 8, and cloned the git repository with my work on. After installing the latest drivers and installing VS 2012, I ran my application, but nothing displayed, all I get is the screen clear colour. I was getting an exception before but thats because I didnt have the right drivers so when calling glGetIntegervGLMAJORVERSION,... Id get 1 as OpenGL wasnt set up correctly. It is initialised correctly now and when stepping through, it looks like everything is working fine, the only problem is Im not seeing anything.p  pTo make sure it wasnt just my code I downloaded some of the Swiftless OpenGL examples and got the exact same thing. My application was using OpenGL 3.2 and no deprecated functionality. My hardware can support up to 3.3, and if it is of any use I am running Window 8 through Boot Camp on a Macbook air.p  pI have been bashing my head against a wall for the last couple of days trying to solve this but Im not having much luck, I thought Id throw it out there to see if anyone has had a similar problem, Id be really grateful if anyone can offer any information. If someone with Windows 8 could download and build a simple OpenGL application though VS just to see if they can get something up on screen that would be interestingp
Negative 73780 pHi all im trying to create a basic screen saver that has a screen split into two, the left hand side will be similar to the dos command tree where it lists all files and folders, the right hand side will be where the files contents are displayed. So when the application starts up the tree on the left is populated and then the application starts to go through all the files one by one opening them and scrolling through them if possible.p  pSo here is where im stuck i cant seem to figure out how to print a directory tree to the screen.p  pIt seems like a trivial question i know but i cant for the life of me find a solution as elegant as the dos command.p  pAs always any help would be appreciated.p
Negative 73780 pI have a company team page that uses a switch statement in the PHP send file to determine the email address of the person, and then send the person a message based on a popup form.

These errors appear below.   We are very sorry, but there appears to be a problem with the form you submitted.   Please RETURN and fix these errors.p blockquote  pI inherited the maintenace of this site and I have no idea how long this feature has been broken, how many emails have not been sent, how many times people have been frustrated by this, so Im trying to get it fixed as fast as possible.

Negative 73780 pProblem In the code presented I am trying to index 26000 geofences polygons. I have tried many combinations of 1inserting the data and 2indexing the data that some are not presented in the code for brevity. I have imported all the data with prebuilt index importing the data and then making the index and making the index and importing the data partially with waiting for nonstale index. In all cases it eats up all the memory and fails by fail I mean I wait for 30 minutes for completing the indexing process. One interesting observation happened in partial inserts with prebuilt index It always starts to eat up all memory around 1790 entries.p  pEnvironment I have tested this on 2 machines 1 4 GB Ram, Dual Core 2.56 CUP 2 12 GB Ram, i7 CPU. I used Visual Studio 2012 which should not be important targeted .NET 4.0 with RavenDB build 2230. The only external library used here other than RavenDB client libraries was NetTopologySuite NuGet.p  pSide Note and Background I am doing my spatial calculations using 2 inmemory data structures a KDTree and an RTree with static data no insertdeleteupdate. Now a new step added to my project which needs to updateinsert some data twice a day because of that I searched for a replacement to remove the burden of housekeeping of this part and I came up with SQLite RTree module. It is fast enough using some parallel programmingit is a mostly readonly database. So far RavenDB is not much of a choice strategic decisions etc but I liked to play with it and it was disappointing. To be precise I love RavenDB 960 and I really am angry with RavenDB 2230.p  pI have used the inmemory trees and tested SQLite with 3,000,000 polygons again to be precise bounding boxes and failed to use RavenDB for 26,000 polygons. I really hope that I am doing something badly wrong.p  pThe codep  precodenamespace MyApp      static partial class Program              static void Mainstring[] args                      Initialization             InitializeIndexes               MODE 1              OneTimeImport1, 1024, true               MODE 2              OneTimeImport1, 1024, false               MODE 3              PartialImport64 and PartialImport32 and PartialImport16                   static void PartialImportint len                      bool finished  false             int index  0               read finished from file             if finished                              return                            read index from file, if not exists then set it to 0              index  OneTimeImportindex, len, true             if index  0                              finished  true                           write index and finished to file             return                   static int OneTimeImportint start, int len, bool waitForIndexing                      var counter  start lt 0  0  start              using var reader  new StreamReaderDPATHDATA.TXT, Encoding.UTF8             using var session  Store.OpenSession                              session.Advanced.MaxNumberOfRequestsPerSession  int.MaxValue  1                  if len lt 0 len  16                  IEnumerableltstringgt lines  null                 if start lt 0  lines  reader.Lines                  else  lines  reader.Lines.Skipstart.Takelen                   foreach var line in lines                                      var parts  line.Splitnew string[]   , StringSplitOptions.None                     var lm  new Area                      lm.Description  parts[5]                     var poly  string.Empty                     if string.IsNullOrWhiteSpaceparts[8]                                              try                                                      var list  new ListltCoordinategt                             var pairs  parts[8].Split                              foreach var p in pairs                                                              var coor  p.Split,                                  var lon  coor[0].ToDouble                                 var lat  coor[1].ToDouble                                 list.Addnew Coordinatelon, lat                                                           if list.Count gt 0                                                              list.Addlist[0]                                  var ring  new LinearRinglist.ToArray                                 poly  new Polygonring.ToString                                                                               catch    some logging                                          lm.Polygon  poly                      session.Storelm                      counter                     if counter  len  0                                              session.SaveChanges                         if waitForIndexing while Store.DatabaseCommands.GetStatistics.StaleIndexes.Length gt 0 Thread.Sleep10                                           Trace.WriteLinecounter                                   session.SaveChanges                 if waitForIndexing while Store.DatabaseCommands.GetStatistics.StaleIndexes.Length gt 0 Thread.Sleep500                           return counter                   static void Initialization                      Store  new DocumentStore  ConnectionStringName  LoxConnectionString              Store.Initialize                   static void InitializeIndexes                      IndexCreation.CreateIndexestypeofProgram.Assembly, Store                   public static IEnumerableltstringgt Linesthis StreamReader reader                      string line  null             while line  reader.ReadLine  null yield return line                   public static double ToDoublethis string s                      double d  0             double.TryParses, out d             return d                   public static DocumentStore Store  get private set            public class Area              public string Id  get set           public string Description  get set          public string Polygon  get set            public class AreaIndex  AbstractIndexCreationTaskltAreagt              public AreaIndex                      Map  docs gt from doc in docs                           select new                                                          doc.Description,                                 SpatialGenerateAreaPolygon, doc.Polygon                                           codepre

Negative 73780 pI have worked with network programming before. But this is my first foray into netlink sockets.p  pI have chosen to study the connector type of netlink sockets. As with any kernel component, it has a user counterpart as well. The linux kernel has a sample program called a hrefhttpwww.cs.fsu.edubakerdeviceslxrhttpsourcelinuxDocumentationconnectorucon.c relnofollowucon.ca which can be used to build userspace programs based on the aforementioned connector netlink sockets.p  pSo here I wish to pinpoint parts of the program that I want to confirm my understanding of and of parts of the program that I do not follow the logic of. Enough talking. Here we go. Please correct me wherever I go astray.p  pAs far as I have understood, netlink sockets are a IPC method used to connect processes on the emsameem machine and hence process ID is used as an identifier. And since netlink messages can be emideallyem multicast, another identifier that is needed by the netlink socket is the emmessage groupem. All components that are connected to the same emmessage groupem are in fact related. So while in case of IPv4, we use a emsockaddrinem in place of the emsockaddrem, here we use a emsockaddrnlem which contains the above mentioned identifiers. p  pNow, since we are not going to use the TCPIP stack of the kernel, in case of netlink messages, netlink empacketsem can be considered to be emrawem please correct me here if I am wrong. Hence the only encapsulation that the netlink packet goes through is the emnetlink message headerem defined as a hrefhttplxr.freeelectrons.comsourceincludelinuxnetlink.hv2.6.34L39 relnofollownlmsghdra. p  pNow coming on to our program ucon, codemaincode first creates a NETLINK family socket with the emconnectorem protocol. Then it fills up the aforementioned netlink socketaddress structure with the relevant information. In order to be a little experimental here, I have added an entry in the connector.h file. Now here comes my first question.p  pA connector message has a certain type defined in connector.h. Now this connector message structure is something that is completely eminternalem to netlink right As in, as far as netlink is concerned, this is all but payload. Rightp  pMoving on, what exactly does the emnlgroupem field mean within the netlink message header structure The definition does not really contain an element of this name. So are we using overlay techniques to fill certain fields of the netlink message header And if so, what exactly is the correspondence I cannot seem to find it anywhere.p  pSo after binding the socket address to the socket, it is sending 10,000 unique pieces of emconnector basedem data, which as far as netlink is concerned, is pure payload. But what is strange as far as these emmessagesem are concerned is, that all of them seem to have the same sequence number.p  pMoving on, we find ourselves in the emnetlinksendem subroutine to send these packets via the socket that we are bound to above. This subroutine uses a variety of netlink helper macros to manipulate the data to send. As we say above, the codemaincode function sends 10,000 pieces of data, each of whom is zerolength and requires no acknowledgement, since the ack field is 0 please correct me if I am wrong here. So each packet is nothing but a emconnector message headerem without anything in it. Rightp  pNow what is surprising is that the netlinkSend function uses the same sequence number as the main since it is a global variable. However, after the post increment in main, it is now 1. So basically our emnetlink talkem is starting with a sequence number of 1. Is that finep  pLooking into some of the helper macros defined in linuxnetlink.h, I will try to summarize my understanding of the ones that are directly or indirectly being used in this program.p  precodedefine NLMSGLENGTHlen lenNLMSGALIGNNLMSGHDRLEN codepre  pSo this macro will first align the netlink message header length and then add the empayloadem length to it. For our case the netlink payload is a connector header without any empayloadem of its own. In our case, this micro is used like sop  precodenlhgtnlmsglen  NLMSGLENGTHsize  sizeofnlh codepre  pHere, what I do not understand is the actual payload of the netlink message. In the above case, it is the size of the connector message header since the connector message itself contains no payload of its own minus the pointer which is pointing to the first byte of the netlink message and thereby the netlink message header. And this pointer is like any other pointer variable equal to the machine word size which in my case is 4 bytes. Why are we substracting this from the connector message headerp  pAfter that, we send the message over this netlink socket just like any other IPv4 socket.  hope to hear from you fellows out there with regards to the above mentioned questions. Including some sentences before the actual quesion would help as my post is rather long. But I hope it would be useful to people more than just myself.p  pRegards.p

Negative 73780 pIm building a relatively simple webapp in ASP.NET MVC 4, using Entity Framework to talk to MS SQL Server. Theres lots of scope to expand the application in future, so Im aiming for a pattern that maximises reusability and adaptability in the code, to save work later on. The idea isp  ul liUnit of Work pattern, to save problems with the database by only committing changes at the end of each set of actions.li liGeneric repository using codeBaseRepositoryltTgtcode because the repositories will be mostly the same the odd exception can extend and add its additional methods.li liDependency injection to bind those repositories to the codeIRepositoryltTgtcode that the controllers will be using, so that I can switch data storage methods and such with minimal fuss not just for best practice there is a real chance of this happening. Im using Ninject for this.li ul  pI havent really attempted something like this from scratch before, so Ive been reading up and I think Ive got myself muddled somewhere. So far, I have an interface codeIRepositoryltTgtcode which is implemented by codeBaseRepositoryltTgtcode, which contains an instance of the codeDataContextcode which is passed into its constructor. This interface has methods for Add, Update, Delete, and various types of Get single by ID, single by predicate, group by predicate, all. The only repository that doesnt fit this interface so far is the Users repository, which adds codeUser Loginstring username, string passwordcode to allow login the implementation of which handles all the salting, hashing, checking etc.p  pFrom what Ive read, I now need a codeUnitOfWorkcode class that contains instances of all the repositories. This unit of work will expose the repositories, as well as a SaveChanges method. When I want to manipulate data, I instantiate a unit of work, access the repositories on it which are instantiated as needed, and then save. If anything fails, nothing changes in the database because it wont reach the single save at the end. This is all fine. My problem is that all the examples I can find seem to do one of two thingsp  ul liSome pass a data context into the unit of work, from which they retrieve the various repositories. This negates the point of DI by having my EntityFrameworkspecific codeDbContextcode or a class inherited from it in my unit of work.li liSome call a Get method to request a repository, which is the service locator pattern, which is at least unpopular, if not an antipattern, and either way Id like to avoid  it here.li ul  pDo I need to create an interface for my data source and inject that into the unit of work as well I cant find any documentation on this thats clear andor complete enough to explain.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI think Ive been overcomplicating it Im now folding my repository and unit of work into one  my repository is entirely generic so this just gives me a handful of generic methods Add, Remove, Update, and a few kinds of Get plus a SaveChanges method. This gives me a worker class interface I can then have a factory class that provides instances of it also interfaced. If I also have this worker implement codeIDisposablecode then I can use it in a scoped block. So now my controllers can do something like thisp  precodeusing var worker  DataAccess.BeginTransaction      Product item  worker.GetltProductgtp gt p.ID  prodName     stuff...     worker.SaveChanges  codepre  pIf something goes wrong before the codeSaveChangescode, then all changes are discarded when it exits the scope block and the worker is disposed. I can use dependency injection to provide concrete implementations to the codeDataAccesscode field, which is passed into the base controller constructor. Business logic is all in the controller and works with codeIQueryablecode objects, so I can switch out the codeDataAccesscode provider object for anything I like as long as it implements the codeIRepositorycode interface theres nothing specific to Entity Framework anywhere. p  pSo, any thoughts on this implementation Is this on the right trackp

Negative 73780 pI like to see color because my scripting is robust enough so far to handle the color codes. It does seem like Im going against the grain here, but I honestly dont see what the big deal is about having to parse stuff like escape codes in scripts. If colors help for interactive use, why wouldnt they help in script use where I might be aggregating data and crunching even more data than I would manually Wouldnt colors be emeven more importantemp  pAnyway, I have a neat little shell script I wrote that munges codegit statuscode output, and im just looking to make this script keep the colors intact. My global git config is set so that the lists of changed and untracked files show up in color in the git status. Unfortunately unlike codegit diffcode there is no option for forcing color for codegit statuscode that I can find. p  pTo be abundantly clear, this is the issue p  precode git status codepre  pproduces perfect output, but excerpt from my script followsp  precodegit status  sed sx1b[34m[0m codepre  pproduces no colored codegit statuscode output, and you can even see here that Im explicitly converting the leading hashcharacters to blue because it helps highlight the different regions of output from my script. p  pDoes anyone know how to get it to put out the colors Is there maybe a standard program I can use that can be used as a fake terminal STDINSTDOUT pipe I am in fact also working on a pty pseudoterminal tool so I could certainly make use of that for this purpose, but its a rather heavyhanded solution and not ready for use yet as I havent finished building it. p
Negative 73780 pThis is running on SQL Server 2008.p  pAnyway, I have sales data, and I can write a query to get the output to look like thisp  precodeid  Name        Period   Sales 1   Customer X  201301  50 1   Customer X  201302  45 codepre  petc. Currently, after running this data, I am rearranging the data in the code behind so that the final output looks like thisp  precodeid   Name        201301  201302 1    Customer X    50       40 codepre  pThe issues arep  ol liThe date YYYYMM range is an input from the user. li liIf the user selects more outputs like, say, address, and a ton of other possible fields relating to that customer, that information is duplicated in emeveryem line. When youre doing 1015 items per line, over a period of 5 years, for 50000 users, this causes problems with running out of memory, and is also inefficient.li ol  pIve considered pulling only the necessary data the customer id  how theyre joined together, the period, and the sales figure, and then after the fact running a separate query to get the additional data. This doesnt seem like it would be efficient though, but its a possibility.p  pThe other, which is what Im thinking should be the best option, would be to rewrite my query to go ahead and do what my current code behind is doing, and pivot the data together, that way the customer data is never duplicated and Im not moving a lot of unnecessary data around.p  pTo give a better example of what Im working with, lets assume these tablesp  pAddressp  precodeid  HouseNum  Street  Unit  City  State codepre  pCustomerp  precodeid  Name   codepre  pSalesp  precodeid  Period  Sales codepre  pSo I would like to join these tables on the customer id, display all of the address data, assume the user inputs 201201  201212, I can translate that into 201201, 201202 ... 201212 in my code behind to input into the query before it executes, so I have that available.p  pWhat I want it to look like would bep  precodeid  Name  HouseNum  Street    City  State  201201  201202  ...  201212 1   X     100       Main St.  ABC   DEF      30              ...    20 codepre  pno sales data for that customer on 201202  if any of the data is blank I want it to be a blank string , not a NULLp  pI realize I may not be explaining this the best way possible, so just let me know and Ill add more information. Thank youp  pedit oh, one last thing. Would it be possible to add a Min, Max, Avg, amp Total columns to the end, which sum up all of the pivoted data It wouldnt be a big deal to do it on the code behind, but the more sql server can do for me the better, imop  pedit One more, the period is in the tables as 201301 etc, but Id like to rename them to Jan 2013 etc, if its not too complicatedp

Negative 73780 pstrongEDIT strong This morning ive test it with iphone 4 and its working perfectly so its probably specific on Android im using Version 4.1.2 Vs AsyncUpload Controlp  pI am currently creating a file upload section on a web page that can be view on every type of device Computer, Tablets and mobile phone. When i test the file upload section on a standard computer everything works perfectly. When i test it on mobile phone Im using Samsung Galaxy S2 with all the latest update i have access to the files on my phone. I can select the file that i want and it seems to upload perfectly  I got the green dot from the telerik control which means that the upload has been successful  but in fact the file created in the template directory of the control  appdataRadUploadTemp  has a size of 0 bytes. So when i press my submit button, the file copied in my working directory is invalid and cannot be read. You can test it yourself on a telerik demo page.p  pa hrefhttpdemos.telerik.comaspnetajaxasyncuploadexamplesadditionalfieldsdefaultcs.aspx relnofollowhttpdemos.telerik.comaspnetajaxasyncuploadexamplesadditionalfieldsdefaultcs.aspxap  pWhen i upload a file on this page from my mobile phone, the file size is always 0... So from there i know that its not something with my code but its something between the control and the mobile browser.p  pI have asked my question on telerik forum but i didnt get any answer yet.p  pDoes someone know if there is a limitation from mobile browser to upload file using RadAsyncUpload control p  pAnd by the way, RadAsyncUpload control use the html5 File API first, if the browser cannot use it, the control will try to use flashsilverlight. if its still not working, it will use standard IFrame module to upload the file. Here are some docs about the control a hrefhttpwww.telerik.comhelpaspnetajaxasyncuploadoverview.html relnofollowhttpwww.telerik.comhelpaspnetajaxasyncuploadoverview.htmlap  pI would like to know if someone else can test it on the demo page and let me know if it works. If not , anyone have an alternative solution to upload file from mobile phone p  pThanks p  pSebastienp

Negative 73780 pCan anyone give me a detailed explanation of why iOS is handling its landscape orientation the way it does in regards to frame and transformationp  pWhat Im talking about is this following behavior displayed by logging the views description in the various View Lifecycle methodsp  precodeviewDidLoad UIView 0x1edb5ba0 frame  0 0 568 320 autoresize  WH layer  ltCALayer 0x1edb5c50gt  viewWillAppear UIView 0x1edb5ba0 frame  0 0 320 568 autoresize  WH layer  ltCALayer 0x1edb5c50gt  viewDidAppear UIView 0x1edb5ba0 frame  0 0 320 568 transform  [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0] autoresize  WH layer  ltCALayer 0x1edb5c50gt codepre  pThe repercussions of this are subtle, but very intriguing. p  pFor example, I launch my app with Initial Interface Orientation, and Supported Interface Orientations both set to Landscape right home button p  pI then display my rootViewController like thisp  precodeself.viewController  [[MyViewController alloc] initWithNibNamenil bundlenil] self.window.rootViewController  self.viewController codepre  pThis .xib has its orientation set to Landscape and its frame set to 0, 0, 568, 320. It displays correctly, and I can touch all points on the screen.p  pThe issue then comes when I present a subview like sop  precodeSomeView someView  [[SomeView alloc] initWithFrameself.view.frame] [self.view addSubviewsomeView] codepre  pAt this point in time, self.view.frame is reported as 0 0 320 568 and self.view.transform is reported as transform  [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. Best case scenario, the end result is that Im only able to touch the left 320px of the view Ive just displayed, worst case is that the views layout is butchered.p  pThanks to various SO questions, Ive learned that the proper way to do this is as followsp  precodeSomeView someView  [[SomeView alloc] initWithFrameself.view.bounds] [self.view addSubviewsomeView] codepre  pWhat I havent learned is why, and Im very curious about that. p  pWhat Im even more curious about is why the view is manipulated the way it is during instantiation and display. p  pIts been quite awhile since Ive tangled with a landscape only application, but for some reason I think the current implementation of this differs from earlier versions of iOS, is that correctp

Negative 73780 pI have a custom session handler class which stores sessions in a database. When writing data, there is some custom logic which handles the write a bit differently based on whether or not it is creating a new session or updating an existing one. To track this, the class property codeexistingSessioncode is set when the session is first read.p  pThe code cut down for brevity is as followsp  precodeclass MySessionSaveHandler implements ZendSessionSaveHandlerInterface      protected existingSession      public function readid              if id              thisgtexistingSession  load existing data from db                   return            public function writeid, data              if thisgtexistingSession               [update session]          else              [create session]                   return true       codepre  pthis all seems to work fine. However I sometimes see errors like this in the logsp  blockquote   pPHP Notice  Undefined property MySessionSaveHandlerexistingSession in pathtoMySessionSaveHandler.php on line xxx,p blockquote  pSince codeexistingSessioncode is a declared property, the only thing I could think that would cause this is if the write method is being called statically. I could modify the variable to be a static property instead, but since the class seems to work, Id like to understand whether session handler class methods are always called statically, or whether it just happens sometimes and if so why.p  pstrongEditstrong the line number in the notice is the line of the codeif thisgtexistingSession code check in the write function.p

Negative 73780 pIn our application we have a scenario where we need to validate an property update based on business rules and the context of the current user.

Negative 73780 pI had a doubt on oracle emgroup byem clause.  Is group by a CPU intensive operation p  pWe have a query on a table with 32M rows and no index column which does group by on 78 columns and aggregates on 3 columns and inserts into another table. Occasionally we are seeing total CPU being utilized by oracle processes as 100.p  pThe query looks something like thisp  precodeinsert into temptable select col1, col2, col3, col4, col5, col6, col7, col8,  sumcol10, sumcol11, count from origtable group by col1, col2,   col3, col4, col5, col6, col7, col8  codepre  pAs far as my understanding goes, To group by we will have to sort and then group.

Negative 73780 pstrongMy Problemstrong I am writing an app for internal use at my pharmacy.  I am gathering some usage data from multiple pharmacy systems to help manage inventory.  95 of the records I can automatically parse how many tablets are used every day, but there are some that require user input.  This input consists of 3 fields date, time, number of tabs for an unknown number of records.  For example, twice a day would have 6 records for 3 days, whereas 3 times a day would have 9.p  pstrongMy Current Solutionstrong The user selects the records to process and starts the procedure.  Any records that can be automatically processed are taken care of.  Any records requiring user input are stuck in a table.  Upon refresh of the page, an Ajax request checks the table for any records.  If a record is present, a modal is shown to the user to allow their input.  The input form has a new record button that shows another round of the 3 fields, then the data is POSTed to a php script.  The script processes the data and removes the affected record.  If multiple records, the ajax script pops another modal.  This continues until the table is empty.p  pstrongHelpstrong There has to be a more elegant solution out there.  Ive look at several CRUD grids, but most seem to be about showing and editing data, not about general data entry.p  pstrongSorrystrong for the wall of text.p

Negative 73780 pIm wondering how to go about changing the timezone of a DateTime object without actually changing the value. Here is the background...p  pI have an ASP.NET MVC site hosted on AppHarbor and the server has its time set to UTC. When I submit a form from my site containing a datetime value, say 9172013 400am, it comes up to the server with that value. However then when I dop  precodepublic ActionResult SaveEntity entity      entity.Date  entity.Date.ToUniversalTime     EntityService.Saveentity  codepre  p...it incorrectly keeps it as the same time 4am because the server is already on UTC time. So after converting to UTC and saving to the database, the database value is 20130917 040000.000, when really it should be 20130917 080000.000, as the browser is on EST. I was hoping after form submission and passing the values to the controller action, it would set the DateTimes timezone to the browsers EST rather than the server hosts UTC, however that didnt happen.p  pIn any case, now Im stuck with a DateTime object that contains the correct datetime value but the wrong time zone, so I cant correctly convert it to UTC. I store the time zone of each user, so if there was a way to set the time zone for the DateTime object without actually changing the value I cant do TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTime because itll change the value then I could have the correct datetime value AND the correct time zone, then I could safely do date.ToUniversalTime. That being said, Ive only seen how to change the KIND of a DateTime, not the TimeZone, without changing its actual value.p  pAny ideasp

The problem is that the code above terminates the 1st layer of subprocesses but not the 2nd one.p  pHow should I do this to terminate both layers at the same timep  pMaybe an important caveat I guess one approach would be to set up an internal queue to communicate from codemaincode to codeprocesslevel1code and then send a signal to each codeprocesslevel1code subprocess to terminate their respective subprocesses. The problem is that codeprocesslevel1code runs an infinite loop reading messages form an external queue. So I am not sure where and how I would check for the terminate signal from main.p

Negative 73780 pI am using Google Tasks API V1 dot net libraries.  In the same project I also want to use Google Drive, Contacts and Calendar APIs.  Drive, Contacts and Calendar APIs are V2.  Now the issue I am facing is that Google Tasks .Net libraries and Google DriveCalendar .Net libraries do not work together.  Visual Studio would not compile error these libraries are linked to different versions of Google.apis.dll.  I tried finding Tasks API libraries V2, but it does not exist. Then I tried finding libraries for Drive or Calendar V1, but couldnt find them either.  This is forcing me to use GData libraries and API for Calendar, Contacts and Drive.  The problem is GData API is deprecated and will go away in 2015.p  pI must be missing something here because I cant imagine Google guys could bungle up this big.p

Negative 73780 pTo make the question clear is the proposal below considered secure i.e. doesnt introduce any significant security risks.p  pI havent seen any clear reason why the following proposal would be considered completely insecure as in, dont even bother, which seems to be the quick answer to anything with the words local storage and secure in the title. Fundamentally, its based on the premise that either you have access to the sensitive data in memory AND the cache, or you have access to neither.p  h2The Starting Pointh2  pI have a web application which includes serverside web services and javascript running in the browser which calls those web services securely, over HTTPS, thats not the issue here and displays the data in the web page. Lets say its an email application that displays your emails  i.e. its sensitive data that you dont want to share with others. p  pA couple of points to note at this stagep  ul liThe user has authenticated with the server and the javascript running in the browser is capable of calling the servers web services to the retrieve the data.li liThe javascript running in the browser also has access to the page and all of the sensitive information is available to that javascript. The sensitive data is in memory  and available to the javascript yes, including any malicious injected javascript.li ul  pUp to this point, its a standard web application, and Im assuming that anybody reading would be comfortable that this is considered acceptably secure.p  h2Adding a Secure Cacheh2  pThe problem is every time a user visits the site, their browser needs to download all of the email information, most of which is the same each time. Wouldnt it be nice if instead of needing to ask the server for all of the information each time, it could cache the data in the browser and check the cache. Bear in mind this is not offline access the browser is still talking securely to the server, but it may use data stored in a browserside cache rather than retrieving it all from the server.p  pHeres the proposalp  ul liWhen the browser retrieves the data, it also retrieves a long, random, servergenerated key. This key is stored against the user, securely, on the server.li liIn the browser, this key sits alongside the sensitive data in javascript memory.li liThe browser uses the key it was given by the server and an accepted cryptographic algorithm e.g. SHA256, encrypts the data it has in memory, and put it in local storage.li liWhen the user closes the browser, or navigates away from the site, or logs out, the browser no longer displays the sensitive information, and the key is also lost alongside it.li lipThe implication is that once the page is gone or very shortly after, the ability for the browser, or anyone with any level of access to it, to decrypt the contents of the cache is local storage is gone. In order to do so, they would need the key if they had the key, they would already have access to the data itself in the browserjavascript memory.pli lipWhen the user later returns to the site, they need to again authenticate with the server in order to retrieve data via the web services.pli liAt the same time, the javascript retrieves the same key from the server, which it can now use to access the cache in local storage.li liPresumably, there could be a process of the server introducing a new key over time in order to avoid the same key being used indefinitely.li ul  pAny thoughts p  pFor what its worth, bear in mind that I have readp  ul lia hrefhttpwww.matasano.comarticlesjavascriptcryptography relnofollowJavascript Crypto Considered Harmfulali liThe similar SO questions a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17280390canlocalstorageeverbeconsideredsecureherea, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5555167howsecureishtml5localstorageforamobiledeviceherea, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12087790securityoflocalstoragehtml5onmobileherea,  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17280390canlocalstorageeverbeconsideredsecureherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17496384whatarethesecurityimplicationsofhtml5localstorageforcreditcardinfoherea.li ul  pso Im at least aware that the concerns around javascript  local storage  securityp

Negative 73780 pTo fully understand this problem some information needs to be given. My brother and I are developing a game for the iOS. The game has characters in it who walk animated from the right side of the screen to the left. These objects are created as a subclass of UIImageView. For example, we have a CharacterImageView that is created through its initializer during a timer on a view controller. So when the timer runs, we increase a variable by one. When the variable reaches a certain number it will create and add an object to the superview such as [[CharacterImageView alloc] init] However, we use a custom initializerp  pWhen we initialize this object we pass it multiple properties, one of them being the CGRect to set its frame. We create multiple instances of the same class during any given level. So the CharacterImageView might have 30 objects initialized with one of six possible starting CGRects. These objects immediately create a timer in their initializer and start running it. The timer manages the animation, which is set up something like thisp  precode voidcharacterTimerFiredNSTimer newTimer       Get the presentationLayer coordinates     CALayer characterLayer  self.layer.presentationLayer     CGPoint currentPoint     currentPoint.x  characterLayer.position.x     currentPoint.y  characterLayer.position.y       If there are no animation keys, begin a new animation     if self.layer.animationKeys              [CharacterImageView animationWithDuration3.0                                             delay0.0                                           optionsUIViewAnimationOptionBeginFromCurrentState                                        animations             CABasicAnimation characterWalking  [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPathposition]              CGPoint newPoint             newPoint.x  currentPoint.x  100             newPoint.y  currentPoint.y              [characterWalking setFromValue[NSValue valueWithCGPointcurrentPoint]             [characterWalking setToValue[NSValue valueWithCGPointnewPoint]             [characterWalking setDuration3.0]              [self setAnimationImageswalkingImageArray]             [self setAnimationRepeatCount3]             [self setAnimationDuration1.0]             [self startAnimating]              [[self layer] addAnimationcharacterWalking forKeyposition]             [CharacterImageView commitAnimations]             [[self layer] setPositionnewPoint]                                                                                              completionnil]       codepre  pOk, so now that the basic information has been given, heres the problem. Every so often, the CharacterImageView wont start in its proper location. Instead, it begins and finishes its animation in the top left corner of the iDevice landscape orientation. Any information would be greatly appreciated and if I need to be more detailed or present more code let me know.p  pThe game is playable and out of 100  200 character creations this usually only occurs once. But its still something that needs to be corrected as it will interfere with gameplay. p

Negative 73780 pWe are facing some weird behaviour in the execution of link functions of 2 nested custom AngularJS directivesp  p1 The first time or each time after a hard page refresh the linking function of the outer directive is executed before the linking function of the inner directive  this is how we expectwant it, since parameters are passed from the outer to the inner directive.p  p2 But then, each time the directive is used again, eg. after navigating away from the view and returning to it without ever refreshing the page, the execution of the linking functions gets reversed i.e. the linking function of the inner directive is executed before the linking function of the outer directive. p  pThis, obviously, results in errors, since params passed from the outer directive to the inner directive which are used in the link function are not yet existing.p  pWe are puzzled by this problem for quite some time now, so we hope there are some bright minds out there that may be able to help us out here  Tx in advancep

Negative 73780 pIm testing out a way to print out stdout from several subprocesses in Python 2.7. What I have setup is a main process that spawns, at the moment, three subprocesses and spits out their output. Each subprocess is a forloop that goes to sleep for some random amount of time, and when it wakes up, says Slept for X seconds.p  pThe problem Im seeing is that the printing out seems synchronous. Say subprocess A sleeps for 1 second, subprocess B sleeps for 3 seconds, and subprocess C sleeps for 10 seconds. The main process stops for the full 10 seconds when its trying to see if subprocess C has something, even though the other two have probably slept and printed something out. This is to simulate if a subprocess truly has nothing to output for a longer period of time than the other two.p  pI need a solution which works on Windows.p  pMy code is as followsp  pmainprocess.pyp  precodeimport sys import subprocess  logfile  openlogfile.txt, w processes  [             subprocess.Popenpython subproc1.py, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, bufsize1,              subprocess.Popenpython subproc2.py, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, bufsize1,              subprocess.Popenpython subproc3.py, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, bufsize1,          ]   while True     line  processes[0].stdout.readline      if line           sys.stdout.writeline         logfile.writeline      line  processes[1].stdout.readline     if line           sys.stdout.writeline         logfile.writeline      line  processes[2].stdout.readline     if line           sys.stdout.writeline         logfile.writeline      If everyone is dead, break     if processes[0].poll is not None and         processes[1].poll is not None and         processes[2].poll is not None         break  processes[0].wait processes[1].wait  print Done codepre  psubproc1.pysubproc2.pysubproc3.pyp  precodeimport time, sys, random  sleeptime  random.random  3 for x in range0, 20     print [PROC1] Slept for 0 seconds.formatsleeptime     sys.stdout.flush     time.sleepsleeptime     sleeptime  random.random  3 this is different for each subprocess. codepre  pstrongUpdate Solutionstrongp  pTaking the answer below along with a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions375427nonblockingreadonasubprocesspipeinpythonthis questiona, this is this should work.p  precodeimport sys import subprocess from threading import Thread  try     from Queue import Queue, Empty except ImportError     from queue import Queue, Empty  for Python 3.x  ONPOSIX  posix in sys.builtinmodulenames  def enqueueoutputout, queue     for line in iterout.readline, b         queue.putline     out.close  if name  main     logfile  openlogfile.txt, w     processes  [                 subprocess.Popenpython subproc1.py, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, bufsize1,                  subprocess.Popenpython subproc2.py, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, bufsize1,                  subprocess.Popenpython subproc3.py, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, bufsize1,              ]     q  Queue     threads  []     for p in processes         threads.appendThreadtargetenqueueoutput, argsp.stdout, q      for t in threads         t.daemon  True         t.start      while True         try             line  q.getnowait         except Empty             pass         else             sys.stdout.writeline             logfile.writeline             logfile.flush          break when all processes are done.         if allp.poll is not None for p in processes             break      print All processes done codepre  pIm not sure if I need any cleanup code at the end of the while loop.

Dataset 2 32 cols  7,500 rows ....  Dataset 3 44 cols  17,500 rows .... codepre  pHere, the number of records and columns are strongdifferentstrong so it is hard to use database structure. And note that each cell of dataset is only consists of either real number or NA... and the dataset is perfectly strongfixedstrong, i.e., there will be no any change.p  pSo what Ive done so far is make them as a filebased table, and write a starting offset of each record in the file. Using this way, quite nice access speedup was achieved, but not satisfactory so far, because an access to each record requires emparsing it as PHP data structureem.p  pWhat I ultimately want to achieve is eliminating the parsing step. But emserializationem was not a good choice because it loads strongentire datasetstrong. Of course it is possible to serialize each record and keep their offset as Ive done but without serialization, but it seems me to not so emfancyem.p  pSo heres the question, is there any method to load a part of dataset emwithoutem any parsing step, but more better than the partial serialization what I suggestedp  pMany thanks in advance.p  ul liMore informationli ul  pMaybe I made the viewers a little bit confused. Each dataset is strongseparatedstrong and they exist as independent files.p  pUsual data access pattern is rowwise. Each row have unique ID by string, and an ID in one dataset could be exists in other dataset, but not necessarily. But above of that, what I concern is accelerating an access speed when I have some query to fetch specific rows in the dataset. For example, let there is a dataset like below.p  precodeDataset 1 plaintext file      obs1  obs2  obs3  ... my1  3.72  5.28  10.22 ... xu1  3.44  5.82  15.33 ... ... qq7  8.24  10.22 47.54 ... codepre  pAnd there is a corresponding index file, serialized using PHP. A key of each item represents unique ID in the dataset, and their value represents their offset in the filep  precodeIndex 1 PHPserialized one, not same as actual serialized one Array    my1 gt 0,   xu1 gt 337,   ...   qq7 gt 271104  codepre  pSo it is possible to know record xu1 starts at 337 bytes from the beginning of dataset file. In order to access and fetch some rows using their unique ID,p  precode1 Load serialized index file 2 Find matching IDs with query 3 Access to those position and fetch rows, and parsing them as an array of PHP. codepre  pThe problems what I have isp  precode1 Since I using exact matching, it is impossible to fetch multiple rows that partially matching with query for example, fetch xu1 row from query xu 2 Even though I indexed dataset, fetch speed is not satisfactory took 0.05 sec. from single query 3 When I tried to solve above problem by serializing an entire dataset, maybe of course the loading speed become substantially slower. codepre  pThe only easiest way to solve above problems is make them as database I would do so, but hope to find better way as keep them with plain text or some textlike format for example, serialized or jsoncoded.p  pMany thanks and interests about my problemp

Negative 73780 pIm surprised that i havent found much online concerning the display of ellipsis in a CEdit control in MFC.

Negative 73780 blockquote   pDisclaimer Unless Im not seeing, this is not the same as described in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16598243pregmatchreturnlongestmatchthis topica and Ill need some time to fully explain the situation.p blockquote  hr  pA very long time ago I a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4663368customregexpfunctiontobeusedinasqliteselectstatementasked a questiona about how to use the REGEXP operator in a SQLite statement. The operator is not implemented by default but it can be in runtime.p  pWell.. As you can see by the dates, that worked for me for years. Not entirely with the help of that topic someone in SQLite mailing list showed me a trick but it worked well.p  pBecause pregmatch works differently of ereg as Ive heard, by returning positively immediately after the first match, I took an additional precaution before populate that SQLite database by sorting the REGEXES Im sure this is not the right plural form from the longest more specific to the shortest more generic.p  pNot a big deal, just a simple uasort using strlen.p  pConsidering a fictional movie management catalog with two URLs like codemanagementactorscode and codemanagementactorsaddcode, this sorting trick saved me from having falsepositives while accessing the first URL and have SQLite responding with the second emresultsetem only because both of them have the same immutable part codemanagementactorscodep  pThis is the current implementationp  precodethis gt dbh       gt sqliteCreateFunction              REGEXP,              function r, s                    return  pregmatch sprintf si, r , s   0              ,              2  codepre  pBeing strongthis  dbhstrong the class property with the PDO instance used.p  pThe situation now is different because this sorting trick did not consider one possibility Two routes where the most generic is also the longest route. For example codemanagementactorsaddcode and codemanagementactorsoverviewcode.p  pConceptually, the second route is more generic because it refers to a simple dashboard listing all the actors and should go to the bottom. In fact its just an alias for codemanagementactorscode.p  pAnd the second route is more specific because it routes the form responsible to add a new record and thus should go to the topp  pThese routes are analyzed from PHP doc comments spread around Controller classes like thisp  precode   Overview     Route    GET,    managementactors   Route    GET,    managementactorsoverview   final public function overview      Add     Route    GET,    managementactorsadd   final public function add  codepre  pAnd comes in this orderp  precodemanagementactors managementactorsoverview managementactorsadd codepre  pBecause I need to identify the Action method theyre structurd in different array indexes with the class method name as keyp  precodeArray      overview gt array          [0] gt managementactors         [1] gt managementactorsoverview     ,      add gt array         [0] gt managementactorsadd       codepre  pLike I said the sorting works and can make this structure becomep  precodeArray      overview gt array          [0] gt managementactorsoverview         [1] gt managementactors     ,      add gt array         [0] gt managementactorsadd       codepre  pBut the whole component fails to work because of pregmatch implementation of SQLite REGEX operator.p  pSo far, the only way, I managed to workaround this issue was to develop the Controller classes like thisp  precode   Add     Route    GET,    managementprojectsadd   final public function add      Overview     Route    GET,    managementprojects   Route    GET,    managementprojectsoverview   final public function overview  codepre  pI mean, in the reverse order.p  pFine All applications in a certain way have their own oddities and I could live with that but, perhaps, in the future, someone else may open this code and give it some maintenance and may not be aware of this limitation.p  pThat said finally I wish to know if there is a way to increase pregmatchs gluttony and make it not stop in the first positive occurrence and match the longest possible like ereg does, or at least I think it does, Ive never saw it in action.p  pOr an alternative solution, of course pp  pAs requested in comments, some examples of the REGEXES, listed in the order theyre inserted in the SQLite database after sortingp  precodemanagementprojectsoverviewb. managementprojectsaddb. managementprojectsb. codepre  pTheyre very simple REGEXES. They match mainly the Request URI. In the end of the REGEX I have only a border to distinguish the fixed string text from the variable part that emmightem exists like Xdebug profiling GET argumentp

Basically, our app embeds the Spotify iOS SDK, offering the ability for the user to choose highlevel audio sources Stations and the entries under Your Music Playlists, Songs, Albums, and Artists. p  pSo, itd be infinitely helpful if a dev could outline which queries would be made from the iOS SDK level and which subsequent queries would be made for the items above.  If it turns out that doing initialrootlevel queries is best done via the web API, could a dev please outline the officialapproved method for forming a URL query  p  pAlso, is theres a whitepaper or formal Spotify doc that formalizes Spotify URIs  p  pThanks Drew SoundSpectrump

Negative 73780 pIm trying to use a modal window UI Bootstrap to update documents in a Mongo datastore and am interested in determining the different ways for doing so.p  pCurrently I have a view that, by way of its associated controller, iterates through a list of documents that gets returned from the database via resource and creates a button for each item. Each button opens a modal instance with its own controller. I pass the item an object to the modal instance controller so that I can display some of its current properties through a form in the modal window.p  pWhat I am looking for are ways to update this item with changed values.p  pShould the modal instance controller do the saving Should I pass an updated object back to the calling controller and update from therep  pAlso, if I used .query to get a list of documents but only pass one to the modal instance controller, how can I perform an update on that particular document without having to look up the id and do a .get on itp

Negative 73780 pIm using Unity 4.6 to develop a 2D game. I want to know if having a lot of GameObjects in the scene out of the cameras sight has a considerable influence on performance.  For example, is it efficient to make an scrollable list of names like 1000 of them each one is a GameObject and has a text, a button etc. I mask them in a specified area for example 10 of them are visible at the same time.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 73780 pI have a simple use case. I need to call a WS asynchronously and show the returned JSON on the UI. The JSON that I get back is an object with multiple properties. For simplicity, the code below only has one property. Since I have multiple properties, I am using ko.mapping.fromJS to map the JSON to the object properties. It all seems to work, except the fetched data doesnt update on the UI. If I manually update the observable, it works.

Negative 73780 pJust wondering if there is a recommended solution for the following scenario.p  pI have a complex expression in my markup to show some error message, e.g.p  precodengshowcurrentSection  pickupfrom ampamp carHireEnquiryForm.pickUpLocation.dirty ampamp carHireEnquiryForm.pickUpLocation.invalid ampamp carHireEnquiryForm.pickUpLocation.error.isLocation codepre  pThis can make the markup messy and hard to unit test, so to get around this I created a function for this, e.g.p  precodengshowisShowError codepre  pNow the isShowError can easily be tested.  Problem now is that the isShowError is invoked on every digest even if the element is not visible.  This for me is even worst as performance it very important.p  pIs there a better way to achieve this Is expressions the recommend way to do this  What if the expression had to include 20 statements  I am keen to reduce the amount of business logic in my markup as well.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 73780 pI have a date and time data set spanning roughly a year and a half and I have converted this information into a python datetime object and plotted this on the xaxis in months versus some dependent data on the yaxis. My question involves taking the datetime data and converting this to cumulative hours, ie rather than plotting april, may, june, july, etc I want to take that datetime information and plot the associated hour number which will add as the months go forward on the xaxis ie 0, 100, 200, 300, etc. I suppose I am looking for suggestions on pseudocode as to how I might increment each hour in the time series after the first 12 hours, any and all help is appreciated, thank you. p

Negative 73780 pI was wondering if there exists a tool for Neo4j that can read an XSD file and use it to enforce a schema on Neo4j.p  pIm newbie on graph databases but Im starting to appreciate the schemaless approach. Theres a lot of projects out there that have been pumping in a lot of nonsequential data and making sense of it all which is really cool.p  pIve come across some requirements that call for control on what properties a node or edge can have given a certain label and what labels an edge can have given the labels of its source and destination nodes. The schema is also subject to change  although not frequent.p  pAs I understand, the standard practice is to control the schema from the application itself which to me doesnt seem like it should be a BEST practice. For example, the picky developers from Oracle land create views for applications to interact with and then apply triggers onto the views that execute the appropriate transactions upon the application attempting to insert or update on the view.p  pI would be looking for a similar device in Neo4j and since I already have the XSD files, it would be a lot less work overall to simply dump them into a folder and have it use those for reference on what to enforce.p  pThis is something Im willing to write myself unless theres already a library out there for this. I have a day job after all. p  pThanksp

Now, my question is is the slowdown because of two threads competing for the lock or is my code somehow faultyp  precode        var source  Enumerable.Range0, 1000.ToList          var buffer1  new BlockingCollectionltintgt100         var buffer2  new BlockingCollectionltintgt100           var t1  Task.Run                      delegate                              foreach var i in source                                      buffer1.Addi                                   buffer1.CompleteAdding                      .ConfigureAwaitfalse           var t2  Task.Run                      delegate                              foreach var i in buffer1.GetConsumingEnumerable                                      buffer2.Addi                     Task.Delay1.Wait                                   buffer2.CompleteAdding                      .ConfigureAwaitfalse           CollectionAssert.AreEqualsource.ToList, buffer2.GetConsumingEnumerable.ToList codepre  pAn update this is just a demo code, I am blocking for 1 milisecond just to simulate some computations that take place in my real code.

Negative 73780 pIm thinking of coding myself a little password manager. An application that can be called with a keyboard shortcut, and then I can select whatever password I need. This would let me use huge complex passwords, needing only memorize a single one. This tools data, the passwords, would be kept on disc, encrypted, and, hopefully, with a single authorization step that tool would be available to the user for multiple identifications. This creates however a single point of failure, so I was wondering what kind of security issues I should keep in mind.p  pThis password manager would have to be intuitively called upon, so I was thinking a OSwide keyboard shortcut could do it, but Im afraid other applications might end up calling it as well without permission. So should I ask for the user password each time this application is called Or should I just assume a malicious application that could call this application, could just as easily record the keystrokes of the user authorizing this tool and just avoid this extra useless stepp  pI was also considering the number of characters in the password and the type of characters. Some applications allow only up to 16 characters per password, I was thinking of letting, in one case, the user select base64 passwords, which would leave only 296 possible combinations of passwords at best. Should I not use base64 passwords Are characters  and  generally accepted as password charactersused in base64 Should I allow non printable characters in the password like newline and nullbase128 Should I worry about memory corruption issues when using the null character Should I allow extended ascii characters in the passwordbase256p  pI was thinking of delivering the password immediately after selection, just type it in whatever object has the focus. In graphical environments though I was considering using the specific OS clipboard API, which I havent read yet. Would there be any security problems there Like clearing the clipboard safely, or sharing of that data with other applications. I seem to recall reading something about javascript code that code access the clipboardI read this several years ago.p  pThese are my worries about the security of such an application so far. If you have some insight into them Id like to read it, and Im also open to hear arguments about other concerns.p

Negative 73780 pI understand that arrays are a primitive class and therefore do not have built in methods to detect out of range errors.  However, the vector class has the built in function .at which does detect these errors.  By using namespaces, anyone can overload the [ ] symbols to act as the .at function by throwing an error when a value out of the vectors range is accessed.  My question is this why is this functionality not default in Cp  pEDIT Below is an example in pseudocode I believe  correct me if needed of overloading the vector operator [ ]p  precodeItemTypeamp operator[]sizet index   Verify that the index is legal. if index lt 0  index gt numitems     throw stdoutofrange      index to operator[] is out of range   return thedata[index]  codepre  pI believe this function can be written into a userdefined namespace and is reasonably easy to implement.

Negative 73780 pIn C on Linux, from what I understand, if the same signal is delivered multiple times, its possible that the signal handler will be called only once. Is it possible to override this behavior Say, for example, that I have several file descriptors, and I want to be notified by a SIGIO whenever there are events on these file descriptors. So I call codefcntlcode with the command codeFSETOWNEXcode on each of them. But if there are simultaneous events on 2 file descriptors I might get only one SIGIO and then never know that an event occoured on the other file descriptor.p  pNow I know you might wonder why I want to use signals at all, rather than jusgt codeepollcode or something. The thing is Im interested in the exact time that the events happen, so I was thinking of calling codeclockgettimecode from the SIGIO signal handler to record the exact time of the event.p

Negative 73780 pI am after a bit of advice. We have a WSS 3.0 server used for document control, currently operating in a W2k3 domain with a trust to another domain. The document library inside it is large with lots of version history. We are wanting to move to sharepoint 2013, does anyone have any advice as to what the best migration method may bep  pThe way I see it we could either take a backup of the content DB and recreate the WSS 3.0 instance and sharepoint setup on a new server  I really cant stress how flimsy the existing box is, we just cannot query it really and then perform an upgrade to 2010 and then to 2013.p  pORp  pUse one of the very many migration tools that are out there such as sharegate although that one is very expensive it seems. p  pJust after what peoples experiences of this are and whether or not the two approaches above are the correct way to go, there seems to be extensive and very good Microsoft documentation on the upgrade path. Just a bit dubious about recreating an instance of our current WSS 3.0 setup.p  pCheersp  pUPDATEp  pSo I think I may have to rule sharegate out as an option after looking at prices. The below may seem like a decent approach for me to take, can anyone spot any problemsp  p1 Backup WSS 3.0 Content database 2 Transfer to a server 2008 box with sql installed and restore DB 3 Install WSS 3.0 on new server 4 Perform a database upgrade to SharePoint 2010 on the server 2008 box. 5 Transfer the upgraded database to my new server 2012 box and restore to SQL. 6 Install sharepoint 2013 and perform the upgrade of the 2010 database to the 2013 version 7 Verification check and then I can finally begin redesigning the solution but this time with all the documents I need in place.p  pI realise there are lots of ifs and buts and im sure there will be many hurdles but is this approach even feasible Googling about and looking at MSDN it seems possible, I dont think the current WSS 3.0 even has any service packs on, hence the need for server 2008 and not server 2008 R2.p

Negative 73780 pI have a SSRS project in which multiple reports are using the same stored procedure. All reports are different obviously but the data source is same. p  pFor example one report is a larger tabular transaction report with 50 fields and 20 parameters, one report is a one parameter and one page report essentially just showing one record in a detailed view. There are few other reports which are very similar to the first tabular report but most of the parameters are defaulted and hidden and they use different fields from the stored procedure. p  pAll of these reports are using same stored procedure say codespTransactioncode which has 20 parameters and returns 100 fields. The way the arguments are handled in the stored procedure is something like thisp  precode               tblTransaction.TransactionID  TransactionId          OR              TransactionId IS NULL         AND                      DateCreatedDaysRelative IS NULL             OR             CASTtblTransaction.Created AS DATE  CASTDATEADDDAY, DateCreatedDaysRelative, GETDATE  AS DATE                  AND                                       DateStartMonthsRelative IS NULL                 AND DateEndMonthsRelative IS NULL                          OR                               tblTransaction.DateStart lt DATEADDMONTH, DateStartMonthsRelative, GETDATE                  AND  tblTransaction.DateEnd gt DATEADDMONTH, DateEndMonthsRelative, GETDATE                                AND      tblTransaction.Receipt  ReceiptRequired     OR ReceiptRequired IS NULL  AND      PubID  dbo.tblJournal.PubID     OR PubID IS NULL  codepre  pI understand its easy to maintain having one code for all report but its a big stored procedure which takes a lot of arguments and returns a lot of fields and non of the report that uses it actually uses all its arguments or fields. p  pSo my question is is it a good practice to have one common big piece of code where half the inputs and outputs are not in use at a time by one report or creating separate stored procedures for each report with only required input and outputs or something else like one stored procedure but with dynamic sqlp

Negative 73780 pIm designing a program that would perform certain operations on a streaming data. Operations are defined by the RPN reverse polish notation expressions provided at runtime. Data is being streamed from a file source, one fixed size portion at a time. Operations reference some of the currently input portion of data, like codedata[1]code. The program applies the same operation to all input portions and streams out the results.p  pIt is quite easy to implement an RPN parser that operates on numbers and arithmetic operation to give the result. However, using such an implementation would imply reparsing the RPN for every data portion.p  pWhat I would like to implement is to build somehow an object that would hold the once parsed RPN implementation based on the alphabet of elementary operations on data, where the program would provide the input data or fillin the inputs, invoke the objects codeoperatorcode to obtain and output the result.p  pHow would one implement such a class a codecallable expressioncode and construct such an object using the nonmodern C no codeC11code or codeC14codep

Negative 73780 pSo the issue that Im running into with this piece of code is that if the repetitions exceed 6 then the program crashes. Playing around with it I realized first of all the sums werent showing up correctly with some couts I placed to test, changing everything to int makes it so the program doesnt crash, but doesnt show the decimals like I need. I am using static cast correctly I thought, but it doesnt seem to add up. I even tried leaving the sum variables as int and keep the average times as a double, but that didnt work either. p  pI cant figure out for the life of me why it would only work up to 6 repetitions and then crash after that.

Negative 73780 pIve tried CDI injection and EJB injection of Stateless EJBs in a Rivr dialog. They dont work. Ive also tried JNDI lookup of the EJBs through the Global JNDI name but I get following error note I am using javaglobal but I get this messagep  pemA JNDI operation on a javacompenv name cannot be completed because the current thread is not associated with a Java Enterprise Edition application component. This condition can occur when the JNDI client using the javacompenv name does not occur on the thread of a server application request. Make sure that a Java EE application does not run JNDI operations on javacompenv names within static code blocks or in threads created by that application. Such code does not necessarily run on the thread of a server application request and therefore is not supported by JNDI operations on javacompenv names.emp  pIs there anyway I can inject or locate CDI Named or EJBs in a Rivr dialogp  pthanks Ignaciop

Negative 73780 pSo this program is supposed to ask the user for a temperature in emKelvinems and the starting emNeem. And then interpolate to find the given value.p  pThe codetempcode array is all temperatures and is used to find what temperature we are between.p  pThe codencode array is all the emNeems and is used to find what Ne we are between.p  pWhatever spots we get in each will end up being the spot we are interpolating in the bigger array, HPE.p  pThe main function ask the user for a temperature and emNeem and calls upon the Interpolation function.p  pThe interpol function is the function that interpolates. First it finds where the given temperature is in the temp array. Then it finds where the given Ne is in the n array. Then it uses that spot HPE[k][l] to do the 2D interpolation.p  pMy problem is when I run it and enter values that should be giving me an answer, I get The value determined is codenancodep  pWhat am I doing wrongp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltmath.hgt  double interpoldouble Ti, double Ne  int main      int ni     double Ti, result, Ne      printfnEnter the temperature in kelvins and Ne separated by a space.n     ni  scanflf lf, ampTi, ampNe     result  interpolTi, Ne     printfnThe value determined is lfn, result    double interpoldouble Ti, double Ne      int i, j, k, l     double y1, y2, y3, y4, t, u, p     double temp[15]           1000.0, 2000.0, 3000.0, 4000.0, 5000.0,         6000.0, 7000.0, 8000.0, 9000.0, 10000.0,         11000.0, 12000.0, 13000.0, 14000.0, 15000.0     double n[8]  10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, 14.0, 15.0, 16.0, 17.0     double HPE[15][8]           0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,         0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,         0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,         0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,         0.0017, 0.0002, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,         0.2980, 0.0407, 0.0042, 0.0004, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0,         0.9582, 0.6961, 0.1864, 0.0224, 0.0023, 0.0002, 0.0, 0.0,         0.9979, 0.9791, 0.8241, 0.3191, 0.0448, 0.0047, 0.0005, 0.0,         0.9998, 0.9980, 0.9804, 0.8335, 0.3335, 0.0477, 0.0050, 0.0005,         1.0, 0.9997, 0.9971, 0.9713, 0.7719, 0.2529, 0.0327, 0.0034,         1.0, 0.9999, 0.9994, 0.9939, 0.9425, 0.6211, 0.1408, 0.0161,         1.0, 1.0, 0.9998, 0.9984, 0.9841, 0.8606, 0.3817, 0.0581,         1.0, 1.0, 0.9999, 0.9995, 0.9948, 0.9503, 0.6568, 0.1607,         1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9998, 0.9980, 0.9807, 0.8358, 0.3373,         1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9999, 0.9992, 0.9917, 0.9229, 0.5448           for i  1  i lt 16  i              if temp[i] lt Ti ampamp temp[i1] gt Ti                      k  i             break                    for j  1  j lt 9  j              if n[j] lt Ne ampamp n[j1] gt Ne                      l  j             break                    y1  HPE[k][l]     y2  HPE[k1][l]     y3  HPE[k1][l1]     y4  HPE[k][l1]      t  Ti  HPE[k][0]  HPE[k1][0]  HPE[k][0]     u  Ne  HPE[0][l]  HPE[0][l1]  HPE[0][l]     p  1  t  1  u  y1  t  1  u  y2  t  u  y3  1  t  u  y4      return p  codepre
