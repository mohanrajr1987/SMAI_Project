Positive 116 pI have a SQL Server database, and I want to move it into the cloud and create a simple browserindependent UI for it. The details arep  ul liThe database is about 2GB in size. It uses SQL Server 2008, however I am happy using any later version. I have successfully restored and tested the database in more recent versions of SQL Server.li liI considered using Amazon RDS or Microsoft SQL Azure for hosting the database. Obviously I have to upload the database into the cloud, I dont mind whether this is by scripting it or restoring a BAK file, and I dont mind what version of SQL Server is provided in the cloud as long as its 2008li liThe interface to the database is via one stored procedure. Information is sent to the stored procedure using an input parameter, then the SP returns a result set of 1 column and several rows.li liThe database is currently hosted on a single computer, and has a simple UI where you type into an entry field and it returns several lines of text. I want to create a similar browserbased interface, eg with an entry field, a submit button to call the stored procedure, and an output area for the SPs response.li liDatabase connections will use SQL Server authenticated logins, as this is the only type of login available to Amazon RDS. The logins will map to a database user that has strongexecstrong permission on the stored procedure, also the database user will be in the strongdenydatareaderstrong and strongdenydatawriterstrong as a security measure.li liMy experience is with SQL Server development, TSQL coding and database security.

Of course, in real world application real life throughput is very dynamic and will almost never be your provisioned amount of 100 writessecond.

For example, my dynamodb during peak hours may receive 500 write requests per second 5 times what I have allocated and would return errors. Is it there some queue I can put in between the client and database, so the client requests go to the queue, the client gets acknowledged their request has been dealt with, then the queue spits out the request to the dynamodb at a rate of 100 writes per second exactly, so that way there are no error returned and I dont need to raise the through put which will raise my costsp

As per my knowledge both can handle real time data analysis in case of IoT data. And, there are tools available for thisin Apache.p  pCloud was present previously which can handle large amount of data...Why Big data came into picture What extra benefit its givingp  pMy question may be funny but your answer will give me real things to understand during client facing and requirement gathering and estimation and design.p  pPLease help.

The file in this case is not strictly a normal file, but rather is a POSIX Message Queue.  I create it via codemqopencode.  It can be closed via codemqclosecode or codeclosecode the former is an alias for the latter on my system.  It can be removed from the system via codemqunlinkcode.  All of this makes it analogous to a regular file, emexceptem that I cannot choose the directory in which the file resides.  This makes the current most popular answer placing the file in codetmpcode unworkable, because the file is created by the system in a virtual filesystem with very limited capacity.  Ive mounted the virtual filesystem in codedevmqueuecode, following the example in codeman mqoverviewcode .p  pThis also explains why I need the name to remain visible making the immediateunlink approach unworkable the file must be shared between two or more processes.p

Negative 116 pI wrote a small app that allows me to compare two database schemas to check for differences in structure. It goes all the way down to column details, which is nice. When I was comparing very small databases, I had no trouble but when I start to compare databases with hundreds of tables, it is annoying to scroll up and down to find where the errors are. Originally, I was using KeyedCollection to hold the tables list, but since it doesnt allow any kind of sort, I have since changed to SortedList. SortedList does sort the indexes, which gives me the tables in alphabetical order, but this is less than what I need. What I need is a class that allows me to sort based on object properties, not only on the index values. I want to push the tables with errors to the beggining of the list for easyofuses sake. Anyone has an idea of which class I could use to accomplish thisp  pEDIT1 The List class doesnt have an index, which is kind of vital for my class. I tried using Dictionary, which does have an index, but doesnt have a sort method. Implementing IComparer doesnt work because the constructor only accepts IComparer of the index type. And since the IComparer is another class that doesnt have access to the inner value list of my list class, I cant compare based on the object properties.p  pEDIT2 I need a class that sorts the index by the object properties, not by the index values, but I am starting to believe such class does not exist.p

When I execute an explain on this query it says that it will use the index, but that it will need to look at every row.  This makes sense since in the worst case, there may only be one row with deviceid  10 and that may also be the row with the smallest clientid and thus at the end of its search.  However, in practice, this is not true.  My table has 10 million rows, and rows with deviceid  10 are spread fairly evenly throughout that table.  Why then doesnt MySQL start at the end of the index and scan until it finds the first row with deviceid  10, stop and return that value  It does not seem possible that this is what is happening since the query takes 30 seconds to execute.p  pIs it that my unique key is implemented as a hash somehow and thus not accessible in a list form  PHPMyAdmin is telling me that it is implemented as a btree, which makes me think that it should be able to do the scan as I mentioned above and quit with the first instance.p  pWhere is my error and how can I make this query execute more quicklyp  pThanksp

Negative 116 pIm working on an application thats similar to Wufoo in that it allows our users to create their own databases and collectpresent records with auto generated forms and views.p  pSince every user is creating a different schema one user might have a database of their baseball card collection, another might have a database of their recipes our current approach is using MySQL to create separate databases for every user with its own tables. So in other words, the databases our MySQL server contains look likep  pmainwebappdb our web app containing tables for users account info, billing, etcbr user1db baseballcardstablebr user2db recipestablebr ....p  pAnd so on. If a user wants to set up a new database to keep track of their DVD collection, wed do a create database ... with create table .... If they enter some data in and then decide they want to change a column wed do an alter table .....p  pNow, the further along I get with building this out the more it seems like MySQL is poorly suited to handling this. p  p1 My first concern is that switching databases every request, first to our main apps database for authentication etc, and then to the users personal database, is going to be inefficient.p  p2 The second concern I have is that theres going to be a limit to the number of databases a single MySQL server can host. Pretending for a moment this application had 500,000 user databases, is MySQL designed to operate this way What if it were a million, or morep  p3 Lastly, is this method going to be a nightmare to support and scale Ive never heard of MySQL being used in this way so I do worry about how this affects things like replication and other methods of scaling.p  pTo me, it seems like MySQL wasnt built to be used in this way but what do I know.

Negative 116 pI have an application which is communicating with many different sites and each site has its own SSL certificate signed by our own internal CA. Doing this prevents us the need from purchasing SSL certificates for each site hundreds or thousands and is more secure then using a wildcard certificate with a shared key on each of those sites. So, basically using a CA certificate is the only way. p  pRight now, I have a mobileprovision file which will install the CA certificate as a profile on the phone. When our iPhone application launches if it gets an SSL Certificate error it redirects to a this mobile provision file via Safari and the user will be prompted to install the CA. p  pThe problem is that I am concerned that the Apple AppStore might deny my app for doing this Just some feedback from other developers at this point, and I wanted to research other ways to accomplish this. p  pBasically what I need to accomplish is allow an SSL connection which will verify against a custom CA certificate which will be embedded in my application. This will make the CA certificate active for only the calls I make. I am using the standard NSURLConnection methods in order to communicate with the service. p  pIs this possible Can someone show me how to load the CA what form PEM and add it to the list of trusted CA certificates for my application If that is not possible what other options do I have Just trusting all certificates isnt really any option, we want to prevent man in the middle attacks and only trust our CA issued certificates.p  pThanksp

Negative 116 pI am using Cherrypy in a RESTful web service and server returns XML as a result lxml is being used to create XML. Some of those XMLs are quite large.

Then, after request has been processed it goes down to 1.1GB and stays there until the server is shut down. After server shut down, memory consumption goes down to 830MB.p  pIn my project, data of course comes from the database, and parameters are being used to specify what data should be retrieved. If the same request with same parameters is made, memory stays at 1.1GB, i.e. no additional memory is being used. But, if different parameters are being passed, server keeps consuming more and more memory. Only way to free the memory is to restart the server.p  pDo you have any ideas on why this is happening and how to solve it Thanks.p
Negative 116 pI was wondering how the windows hostname resolution system works.br More precisely I wonder about the use, or lack thereof, of stronglocal cachingstrong in the process.br According to a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb172218 relnofollowMicrosoft TCPIP Host Name Resolution Ordera, the process is as followsp  ol liThe client checks to see if the name queried is its own.li listrongThe client then searches a local Hosts filestrong, a list of IP address and names stored on the local computer.li liDomain Name System DNS servers are queried.li liIf the name is still not resolved, NetBIOS name resolution sequence is used as a backup. This order can be changed by configuring the NetBIOS node type of the client.li ol  pWhat I was wondering is, whether stage 2 is cached in some way.br The sudden interest arose this last few days, as I installed a malware protection SpyBot that utilizes the codeHOSTScode file. In fact, it is now 14K entries big, and counting...br The file is currently sorted according to host name, but this of course doesnt have to be.br lg14K, means 14 steps through the file for each resolution request. These request probably arrive at a rate of a few every second, and usually to the same few hundred hosts tops.p  pMy view of how this emshouldem work is like thisp  ol liOn system startup the windows DNSresolution mechanism loads the HOSTS file a single time.li liIt commits a single iteration over it that sorts file. A working copy is loaded into memory.br The original HOSTS file, will not be further read throughout the resolutions process life.li liAll networkprocesses IE, Firefox, MSN... work via this processmechanism.br No other process directly interfacesreads HOSTS file.li liUpon receiving a name resolution request, the process check its memoryresident strongcachestrong.br If it finds the proper IP then is answers appropriately.li liOtherwise its not cached, the resolution process continues to the memory resident sorted HOSTS file, and does a quick binary search over it. From here on, the process continues as originally described.br The result of the resolution is cached for further use.li ol  pThough I am not sure as to the significance of these, I would really appreciate an answer.br I just want to see if my reasoning is right, and if not, why sobr I am aware that in this age of alwayson PCs the cache must be periodically or incrementally purged. I ignore this for now.p

Can I rely on the file name always being transmitted or do I have to give the user the option to enter a name if none was submitted If a name was submitted I do not want to prompt him for a specific reason that is not important.

Negative 116 pWhen I open a file with ODIRECTOASYNC and do two concurrent writes to the same disk sector, without a fsync or fdatasync in between, does the linux disk subsystem or the Hardware disk controllers offer any guarantee that the final data on that disk sector will be the second write   p  pWhile its true that ODIRECT bypasses the OS buffer cache, data ultimately ends up in the low level IO queue disk scheduler queue, disk drivers queue, hardware controllers cachequeues etc. I have traced the IO stack all the way down to the elevator algorithm.br   For example if the following sequence of requests end up in the disk scheduler queuep  precodewrite sector 1 from buffer 1   write sector 2 from buffer 2   write sector 1 from buffer 3 [Its not buffer 1]   codepre  pthe elevator code would do a back merge to coalesce sector1,2 from buffers 1,2 respectively. And then issue disk two disk IOs. But I am not sure if the final data on disk sector 1 is from buffer 1 or buffer 3 as I dont know about the write reordering semantics of driverscontrollers.p  pScenario 2p  precodewrite sector 1 from buffer 1   write sector 500 from buffer 2 write sector 1 from buffer 3 codepre  pHow will this scenario be handled A more basic question is when doing writes in ODIRECT mode with AIO, can this sequence of requests end up in the disk schedulers queue, in the absence of explicit write barriers br  If yes, is there any ordering guarantee like multiple writes to same sector will result in the last write being the final write br   or is that ordering nondeterministic [left at the mercy of the disk controllerits caches that reorder writes within barriers to optimize seek time]p

Negative 116 pLets say you have a site where users may open chat rooms. Once a room is opened, the users may invite others and chat.p  pLets also pretend you want to use WebSockets for the communication with the clients. In most serverside WebSocket implementations there is a simple function like codeconnection.broadcastmessagecode which sends messages to all connected hosts, but not the one who initiated the broadcast. This is a great feature, because you dont need to keep a list of all clients for your self, to keep them updated. The problem with the chat room example is that, in this case, You dont want to broadcast every message to everyone, but only to the other clients who are in the same room.p  pThis leaves me with two optionsp  ul liRoll my own codebroadcastToRoomroomidcode function, which in turn means to track all clients and rooms.li liSpawn a new instance of the server on a new port every time a new room gets created.li ul  pWhat would you dop

Negative 116 pLet me first try to explain what Im trying to achieve.p  pIm making a game where the player can pickup powerupswhich I called, for some reason, Loot in my game. So heres a really basic form of my Loot classp  precodepublic class Loot  Sprite      Properties and fields...      public Lootparameters...                public virtual OnPickUpPlayer player            codepre  pemPlayerem and emSpriteem are classes from me. Heres my problem my sprite class holds a positiona Vector2, a struct from XNA representing a vector and from my understanding of how C works, copying two sprites will copy the strongreferencestrong of eachother, therefor, whenever I change ones position, it will change the other ones too. p  pWhenever a loot should spawn, I have a class holding the possible loots that can spawn which returns a random one and the loot is copied and shown to the screen, but as soon as I get more than one of the same type of loot, it messes up because of the reference copy problem both will share the same position and only one will be visible.p  pSo then I tried creating a new Loot object whenever I needed to spawn a new loot, so I had to provide a constructor with multiple parameters to easily copy a loot this way  Lets pretend toSpawn can be any type derived from the Loot class, like a HealthPack, or whateverp  precodeLoot spawning  new LoottoSpawn.Position, toSpawn.Color etc... codepre  pIt looked right until I decided to implement OnPickUp. Since I create a new strongLootstrong object rather than the proper child class, the functionality of emtoSpawnems emOnPickUpem function would disappear and picking up a loot would end up doing nothingit would only call the base class Loots empty function.p  pObviously, I am doing something wrong here. I dont have much programming experience, and even less with C, so I really have no idea of how I can fix this. I tried using an Actionlt Player object representing the OnPickUp functionality, it would work but still limit me quite a lotsince I have to pass a static function as an Actionlt Player, therefor limiting me to use the information of the player parameter and preventing me from using the subclass specific information.p  pSo, finally, my question really is strongWhat would be a better design to allow having subclasses with overloaded functions, but still being able to clone the base class and its propertiesstrongp  pThank you for your precious time.p  pemIf anything is not clear enoughand I know its not, then just ask me in the comments and Ill try to describe my problem in more details.emp

Negative 116 pI have several views inside one main view. Those views are all behind one another so that only the top one is currently seen. What I would like to do is, upon some particular user input, have one of the views in the back move lower on the screen, so it can be seen below the top view. Ive been trying to do it by determining if the two views are currently overlapping, lower the one in back, if they are still overlapping, lower it more, and so on until they no longer overlap and are both entirely visible. Then Id like for the main view to resize so that both views can be seen but I think thatd just be using setBounds or setFrame, havent gotten there yet. p  pFor the first problem I havent found a way to literally see if two views overlap, if that cant be done I thought maybe by drawing rects on the view bounds and checking if those overlap, but I dont get how I can do either of these. I think bounds or frame is needed, but Im not really sure how these are different.p  pBasically, I want to check if two NSViews overlap, if they do, I want to lower one of them.p  pEDIT This part of the problem is pretty much solved, but now a new problem arose. I have three views, one main view, and two subviews. The main view doesnt have anything, it only contains several subviews, whatever is inside the main view is what should be seen. The two subviews are stacked on top of the main view, so that the frontmost one is the visible one, the one behind it is set to hidden. When the user hits start, the view in the back becomes visible and I set a repeating timer with a selector that will check if the views overlap, like Vince said, if they do, it offsets the one in the back down a little and checks again until they dont overlap anymore. Using thisp  precode voidupdateViews  CGRect viewFrame  [view frame] view is the frontmost view that will not move CGRect backroundViewFrame  [backgroundView frame] the view in the back  CGRect rectIntersection  CGRectIntersection viewFrame,                                               backgroundFrame  if the intersect is NOT null, itll offset down by 2 if CGRectIsNullrectIntersection      CGRect newFrame  CGRectOffset                                      rectIntersection,                                     0,     doesnt move in x                                     2     lowers by 2 in y                                          [backgroundView setFramenewFrame] lowers the view to the new offset rect   else     [viewsUpdater invalidate] stops the timer when rects no longer intersect     viewsUpdater  nil  codepre  pThe problem is that when I lower the backgroundView, its only visible in the space where it intersects with the front view. Even if I expand the main view lower which is the idea, they will all start one on top of the other with the same dimensions and when the backgroundView lowers, the main view will adjust and display both. But right now it doesnt matter how large the main view is, the backgroundView is only visible in the area where it intersects with the front view. I think its moving to where it has to, but by the time it stops its completely invisible, so I cant tell.p  pThanks for the help.p

Negative 116 pMy site is a hrefhttpfridgecow.com relnofollowhttpfridgecow.coma. Thanks to the blog I recently installed to the front page, I now have over 100 HTTP requests, and most of them to the same site. I have done all I can on my side sprited, condensed, etc but still I end up with a massive load time.p  pIs there any Share buttons that get round this problem maybe with an href attributep
Negative 116 pstrongThe backgroundstrongp  pFirst of all, the background. Ive created an infinite scrollview by using an UIScrollView with the width of three pages 0, 1 and 2 and then made sure that the UIScrollView always is centered on page 1 when not being scrolled upon. When you scroll to either page 0 or page 2 and the UIScrollViewDelegate senses that the scrolling ended, the content of all the three pages first switches in the direction that youve scrolled and then the UIScrollView instantly moves back to page 1, simulating the effect that you can continue to scroll through an endless stream of pages.p  pAt first, I used a UITextView to display the text content of each page, but pretty soon wanted something more flexible when it comes to styling the text. I therefore ended up using a UIWebView in which I load an NSString containing the styled HTML content I wish to display. This worked perfectly, just the way I wanted it to look.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pNaturally, it takes longer time to load, parse and show a simple HTML page in a UIWebView than it takes to just load a static text in a UITextView. Because of this, when youve scrolled in whatever direction, and the scroll view automatically moves back and switches the content of the pages, you can hint the old content for a tenth of a second before the new one shows.p  pstrongMy solution that did not workstrongp  pI searched for the UIWebViewDelegate in the documentation and found that theres an event when the page is done loading. I hooked this up to do thisp  ol liUser scrolls from page 1 to page 2.li liUIScrollViewDelegate calls scrollViewDidEndDecelerating, telling page 1 to switch its content to the same content currently being displayed at page 2.li liUIWebViewDelegate of page 1 calls webViewDidFinishLoad, telling the UIScrollView to move back to page 1 and then switch the content of page 0 and 2.li ol  pIn my head this would fix this problem, but apparently its still not enough. Therefore, I ask you for help. Any ideas Might be worth mentioning that Ive had NSLog in all the methods and made sure that theyre being called. If theres anything else, Id be glad to answer any questions you have.p  pThanks in advancebr br p  pstrongView Controller containing UIScrollViewstrongp  precode     Sense when the UIScrollView stops accelerating      voidscrollViewDidEndDeceleratingUIScrollView sender          ifpScrollView.contentOffset.x gt pScrollView.frame.size.width              [self switchToNextPost]          else if pScrollView.contentOffset.x lt pScrollView.frame.size.width              [self switchToPreviousPost]                     Update the currentPost variable and switch page 1      voidswitchToNextPost          [prefs setInteger[[self getNextKeynil] intValue] forKeycurrentPost]          [self loadPostWithKey[self getCurrentKey] atPage[NSNumber numberWithInt1] withViewControllercurrentPage]            Update the currentPost variable and switch page 1      voidswitchToPreviousPost          [prefs setInteger[[self getPreviousKeynil] intValue] forKeycurrentPost]          [self loadPostWithKey[self getCurrentKey] atPage[NSNumber numberWithInt1] withViewControllercurrentPage]            Custom delegate function.

Negative 116 pstrongPreludestrong I have a large dataset with several hundred thousand records stored in a MySQL database. Greatly simplified, each row has a datetime field to store the date and time at which a telephone call was made and an integer field to store the length of the call.p  pbr strongScenariostrong Im busy writing an interpolation function in PHP which generates a range of dates separated by a precalculated interval. Each generated date is stored in an associative array with the date used as the key, and each value initialized to 0. The script then queries the database for a list of records and attempts to match the datetime record to the closest date in the pregenerated associative array. When the closest match is found, it simply adds the call duration to the existing value of the array at that index.p  pbr strongExample of the generated associative arraystrongp  precodearray       array  20110101 090000 gt 0,                       20110101 093000 gt 0,                       20110101 100000 gt 0,                       20110101 103000 gt 0,                       20110101 110000 gt 0,                       20110101 113000 gt 0,                       20110101 120000 gt 0                     codepre  pIn the above example, a range of dates is generated using an interval of 30 minutes.p  pbr strongExample of records from the MySQL databasestrongp  precode  datetime             duration    20110101 090226         1   20110101 091451         1   20110101 104033       549   20110101 111027        38   20110101 113150        82   codepre  pEach of these records now needs to be matched to the closest datetime key from the pregenerated array given above and the codedurationcode value added to the existing value of the match.p  pbr strongThe Problemstrong Its easy enough constructing two nested codeforcode loops to interate through the records from the database and then linearly run through the associative array to find a match, but this is hugely inefficient, and becomes problematic for large datasets think bubblesort, thats what this would be roughly equivalent to. A slightly better approach is to linearly loop over the records from the database, and then iterate over the array as a binary tree, which is certainly a lot more efficient, and is possible since both arrays are sorted chronologically.p  pbr strongThe Questionstrong Is there a more efficient way of handling this date matching than how Ive described in the above problemp

Negative 116 pI have a web app Im writing in modperl 2.  Its a custom handler module, not registry or perlrun scripts.  There are several configuration options Id like to have set at server initialization, preferably from a configuration file.  The problem Im having is that I havent found a good place to pass a filename for my apps config file.p  pI first tried loading .app.conf but the current directory isnt the location of the modules, so its unpredictable and errorprone.  Or, I have to assume some path  relative or absolute.  This is inflexible and could be problematic if the host OS distribution is changed.  I dont want to hardcode a path though, something in etc may be acceptable if theres just no better way.p  pI also tried PerlSetVar, but the value isnt available until request time.  While this is workable, it means Im potentially reading a config file from disk at least once per child thread init.  I would rather load at server init and have an immutable static hash that is part of the spawned environment when a child is created.p  pI considered using a config.pl, but this means I either have a config.pl with one option to configure where to find the app.conf file, or I move the options themselves into config.pl and require endusers to respect Perl syntax when setting options.  Future users will be internal admins, so thats not unreasonable, but its more complicated than Id like.p  pSo what am I missing  Any good alternativesp

Negative 116 pI have java code that creates and populates tables in a derby database, using text files as source data.  Im currently running it out of eclipse indigo, on Win7, and it works fine.p  pI have other code in that program that, based on user choice, creates the database into which that data is to go.  I cant get that part to work.p  pIt uses jdbcderbyxycreatetrue as its connection string it throws an exception from DriverManager.getConnectionconnectionString, properties saying The database directory blahblahxy exists however, the it does not contain the expected service.properties file.  Perhaps... and some more irrelevant stuff.p  pBefore I run this, I delete the directories x and y, and then perform a refresh on the eclipse project that my code is in.  These directories currently live in the same directory as my eclipse project.  After I run my code, directories x and y have both been created, but not my database.p  pIf I delete the directories, open a command prompt, set my default to the directory that is to contain x, start ij, and use the connect statement with the same connection string given above, it creates the directories and the database.  THEN my program will populate the database as expected, no errors.p  pI have also tried creating the database directly in the workspace directory that my project is in i.e., y without a parent directory of x, with the same result, so I dont emthinkem its the slash in the database name spec.p  pSo I would like to know what I might be doing wrong that prevents that program from creating the database, just like the connect statement in ij will do.p

Negative 116 pIve come across a strange behaviour in .NETReflection and cannot find any solutionexplanation for thisp  precodeclass A      public virtual string TestString  get set    class B  A     public override string TestString           get  return x       codepre  pSince properties are just pairs of functions codegetPropNamecode, codesetPropNamecode overriding only the get part should leave the set part as it is in the base class. And this is just what happens if you try to instanciate class B and assign a value to codeTestStringcode, it uses the implementation of class A.p  pBut what happens if I look at the instantiated object of class B in reflection is thisp  precodePropertyInfo propInfo  b.GetType.GetPropertyTestString propInfo.CanRead  gt true propInfo.CanWrite gt false codepre  pAnd if I try to invoke the setter from reflection withp  precodepropInfo.SetValuetest, b, null codepre  pIll even get an codeArgumentExceptioncode with the following messagep  blockquote   pProperty set method not found.p blockquote  pIs this as expected Because I dont seem to find a combination of codeBindingFlagscode for the codeGetPropertycode method that returns me the property with a working getset pair from reflection.p  pEDIT I would expect that behaviour if Id use codeBindingFlags.DeclaredOnlycode on codeGetPropertiescode but the default codeBindingFlags.Defaultcode takes inherited members into account and the setter of TestString clearly is inheritedp

Negative 116 pI have ImageViews and TextViews in my layout activity is inside a Tab, and a button at the bottom. I want the whole layout to be scrollable, but not the button at the bottom. Now where to put the codeltScrollView ...gtcode and codeltScrollViewgtcode keeping in mind that only one child is allowed inside ScrollView It seems like wherever I put these, it doesnt scroll.

Negative 116 pTLDR How do I return columns without adding them to the GROUP BY clause in MSSQL   The criminal statement is below.p  pHello Everyone,    So I recently asked this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9243368sqlserverjoinwithlatest2entriesquestiona and got a great solution which I was able to dissect and reassemble to suite my problem.  Here is the final resultp  precodeWITH UC AS      SELECT OSJ.opportunityid, OS.status,            ROWNUMBER OVER PARTITION BY OSJ.opportunityid ORDER BY creationdate DESC RN     FROM Opportunitystatusjoin OSJ     JOIN OpportunityStatus OS ON OSJ.opportunitystatusid  OS.opportunitystatusid  SELECT O.opportunityid , O.salesperson ,     MAX CASE          WHEN RN  1             THEN UC.status         END  AS MostRecent ,     MAX CASE          WHEN RN  2             THEN UC.status         END  AS SecondMostRecent FROM Opportunity O JOIN UC ON UC.opportunityid  O.opportunityid WHERE UC.RN lt 2 GROUP BY O.opportunityid , O.salesperson codepre  pNow if I want to return more columns from the Opportunity table i.e O.shoesize, O.favoritecolor, I have to add them to my GROUP BY clause.  But I just get a dirty feeling because I am not trying to group the other columns, I just want them to show up with their respective opportunity.p  pA blog I found on the internet said to stuff your GROUP BY clauses as far in to your nested selects as possible.  However, since I am using the first statement  with UC... that seems to make things less intuitive.  What is a smart way to include other columns from my table without adding them to the GROUP BY clause.p

Wouldnt that be more inline with the rest of the .NET programming paradigm Ifwhen the developer explicitly destroys a locked mutex... it only makes sense to mark it as abandoned.p

Negative 116 pIn my iPhone app, I need to show a large number max 150 of small dots of 10x10 pixels that move around the screen individually. They dont need to move smoothly in any way, but need to be updated every second or so. Currently I have that implemented as a single CALayer that I redraw every second.p  pBut I understand that CALayers are very efficient because they are mapped to the GPU hardware. So I wondered if it would be more efficient in terms of battery usage to create a separate CALayer for each dot and move that by setting their position properties.p  pSo I wonder whether you have experience with that. The CPU would have less to do, but the GPU more. How many CALayers can still be handled by the GPU hardwarep  pIf I make them separate CALayers, I could also easily animate them, which would look much better. Would that be a lot more energy intensivep  pWhat makes it worse in my case, is that I currently use a CATiledLayer for them, with a maximum of 4 tiles that are exposed. That also means I need to redraw them 4 times each update.p

I am unsure as to the accepted approach for this problem, the only solution I can see so far is to ask the user to override their nickname, but this doesnt seem too elegant.p  pThe reason the nickname needs to be unique is not a code issue, but an interface issue, for example there are forums and I want each user to be uniquely identified by their nickname.p  pAre there any other methods anyone can suggest for dealing with this problem p  hr  pEdit At the request of some of the replies I will clarify an examplep  pLets say I have a user named Joe Bloggs who is a member on my website.

His Twitter name is JoeBloggs, so when he signs in with Twitter, my system attempts to automatically set his nickname to JoeBloggs. However, this nickname already exists. What is the normal or best practice in the cases where nicknames like this overlap The only thing I can think of is to prompt the user to specify a different and unique nickname just for display on my site.p  pThe reason I ask is that this must be a common issue for sites which let you login via Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo  there must be an overlap in the names which are returned from said websites, so I wondered what the normal process is.p

Negative 116 pI am just learning to use Services, and am sort of stuck. p  pI have an codeIntentServicecode that I use to download a queue of files. I have an codeActivitycode that has the ability to turn what files should be downloaded on and off. After a file is done downloading I update a boolean in my codeSharedPreferencescode. I have two questionsproblemsp  ol lipThe original Activity that started the Service will most likely be gone, but is very possible that a new instance of that Activity has been started. In that case I need send a message to that Activity to check the SharedPreferences and update its UI accordingly. Therfore my question is strongHow can I send a message to an Activity that may or may not be runningstrongpli lipThe Activity can be turing on and off what files should be downloaded while the Service is running. This creates a couple situations. If the Service is not running and the file gets turned on, then I want to start it with this file added to its queue. If the Service is running and the file gets turned on, then I want to simply add the file to its queue. If the Service is not running and a file gets turned off, I already have a method to delete it. However, if the Service is running and has not downloaded the file I want to remove it from its queue or if it is currently downloading it, to stop downloading it. I am keeping what files should be downloaded in my SharedPreferences, so I guess all of these could be covered by sending a message to the Service to check the SharedPreferences. This leads to my second question strongHow can I get if a Service is running, and if it is, send it a messagestrongpli ol
Negative 116 pIm self teaching myself to do MySQL and PHP. It is a new world to me, i have a couple of books and i do a lot of research on google before asking here. So Im stuck with the following problem and I cant find an answer, I have a MySQL database, the database has a specific field called URL. p  pPart of the URL field looks like thisp  precodeamppathproductsampuserMark24ampid2616 codepre  pcurrently i have it set up so people can search for items in the database, and that works great. what i want to be able to add to the search feature is search by user. as you can see the user is in the middle of the entire url so i have thisp  precode    query  select Productid, Productname, url,  from Products where Productid like keyword or Productname like keyword or url like keyword      result  mysqliquerydbc,query codepre  pNow comes the real issue,  this works wonders, people can actually search for the username and it will display exactly what i want. However if people search for the word products or path which is also in the url they will get over 2000 matches because every single url in my database has the word products and path. Why I want to avoid that i dont want customers looking up our entire database, Im also afraid of server overload because with each query a customer gets an image of the product, along with the product name and the link to the product. trying to load over 2000 pictures also slows down or crashes my browser, so i need to fix this somehow, but im not sure how to tackle it.p  pSo is there a way to match only the part that says userblah for the URL field do i do this with PHP, pregmatch perhaps p  pAny information provided is highly appreciated Thanks.p

Try to go to the security tab. You should see me message like thispli ul  blockquote   pThere is a problem with your selected data store. This can be caused   by an invalid server name or credentials, or by insufficient   permission. It can also be caused by the role manager feature not   being enabled.

The following message may help in diagnosing the problem Unable to   connect to SQL Server database.p blockquote  pI already googled for a solution to my problem but it seems that most answers are targeting older versions of MVC  visual studio, so I wasnt successful yet. What surprises me is there is no membership nor a roleManager section in the web.config when you use the standard MVC 4 template whereas if you create a ASP.NET Forms application youll see both sections. Unfortunately I got the same error with the ASP.NET WebForms template so I didnt continue to investigate.. Also, the roleManager or membership config sections typically define a provider which is comes from the System.Web.Provider assembly. The MVC 4 template does not even reference the System.Web.Provider assembly, so I wonder how the rolemembership works in MVC 4. It might be obsolete in the new version but I didnt find information on this topic the System.Web.Security assembly seems to replace System.Web.Provider. My error might also be related to the fact that I only have LocalDB installed and no other SQL server instance. p  pSo my question is Can you reproduce this error and are you able to fix it What is the cause of thisp  pAny help will be appreciated.p

Negative 116 pIve just installed a new version of perl on my linux webserverupgrading from 5.10.1 to 5.12.4, and Id hoped that everything will go smoothly but it seems that it didnt. The default perl version now in the system is the new one, but modperl is still stuck on the older version. My question is can i just tell modperl to use the new version of perl, or do i have to reinstall it From what i think there should be a way of just changing the interpreter and not reinstalling, but I wasnt able to find it yet.p

Negative 116 pI have a series of UItextViews in a UIscrollview. The number of textviews there are depends on the user, there can be as many as he wants. p  pI assign to each UItextView which I add to an NSMutableArray the same UItapGestureRecogniser. When a UItextView is tapped on, a line is drawn which connects the textField to a point that is touched on the screen by the user. Everything works fine, except for the fact that when I scroll down, I get a wrong y coordinate for my starting point, which I set in this wayp  precodeCGPoint coords coords.y  textname.frame.origin.y  15 codepre  p...where textname is the sender of the gesturep  pIs there a way to get the coordinate of the actual screen, without considering that the UItextView is in a UIscrollViewp

Negative 116 pOn our site we have video thumbnails, clicking the thumbnail opens up the video in a modal dialog.p  pThe video itself is 169 but the player has extra details at the bottom so isnt.p  pIn the dialog we have two buttons, grow, and shrink.p  pThe buttons growshrink the player in steps of originalsize  growBy. So, for steps of 50 of the original, growBy would be 1.5.p  pAnyway, this is all working great and is shown in code block 1,p  pThe issue I am running into is that I need to put a limitation in so that, if the dialog is asked to grow beyond the width or height of the window it will simply grow to the in ratio maximum size it can.p  pE.g. if we are asked to grow beyond the maximum width of the window, the dialogs width including padding will be equal to the window width, but the height will not be unless of course the dialog ratio happens to exactly match the window, but thats unlikelyp  pConversely, if we are asked to grow beyond the maximum height of the window, the dialogs height including padding will be equal to the window height, but the height will not be again unless the dialog ratio happens to exactly match the window. p  pThis is where I am getting stuck and my attempt is in code block 2, Right now I am just doing the check for too big height, but I have that working fine to do the height, the issue is that, I dont know how to work out what the width should be when the height step is adjusted.

Negative 116 pAs we know, Delegate has two properties, one is for method infor and the other is for the target object. but it is very strange on WinRT. if a view model implement INotifyPropertyChanged as belowp  precodepublic class PropertyChangedViewModel  INotifyPropertyChanged      public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged              add  some code to add handler of value          remove  some code to removehandler of value        codepre  pin the method add and remove I find the value.Target is null when this event is used by the internal code of XAML binding. That is to say, if I bind some property of the view model on the xaml file, then the winrt will automaticlly register the event PropertyChanged of this view model, and then the add method is call, but I placed a break point in this add method and find the Target of value is null. Im implementing a cross platfrom mvvm library for wpf, winrt, silverlight and wp 7 so I cant use PropertyChangedEventManager, I have to manually to keep a weak reference to the target and then invoke the method with the target, unfortunately, the targer is null, while the method is not a static method, so when I triger this event later, I get exception.

Negative 116 pI have been tasked to create a very specific, complex home page for our Joomla site.  My first attempt was to install a module that let me include php code, CSS styling and other notallowed stuff in the Custom HTML Module its called Flexi Custom Code.  And it works well  as designed. p  pBut Im running it problems with the basic fact that all modules will be imbedded in several layers of Joomlas div structure down to the section I install that custom module like mainbodytop for example.p  pSo I get ugly white space at the bottom and margins on the sides I do not want. Plus lots of other things I am finding that I need to override or zero out.p  pMy basic question is this Is there a way to create a custom home page that Joomla does not control, but all the links on the home page go into Joomla and everything else is controlled by Joomlap  pWould I have to replace the index.php in the root dir Or the template dir  Or is there another way that is the commonly accepted methodp

Negative 116 pI have been following the discussions about whether or not there should be a dedicated place to store MetaData in pandas DataFrame and I would personnally find this feature very helpful.p  pBefore this gets implemented in a future version, I have been looking at 2 workarounds, but none of them looks really satisfying.p  pSince I cant have a class inherit from DataFrame, I tried to make a class MyDataFrame that contains a DataFrame and implement all the methods add, mul... However, this seems like a tedious approach given the number of methods available to manipulate the DataFrame.p  pMoreover, The data I manipulate originate from physical hardware spectrum analyzers, oscilloscopes... and in principle, I want to have a set of metadata measurement bandwidth, number of averaging... associated with each column of the dataframe. The structure that needs to be coded to maintain the onetoone correspondance with the DataFrames structure looks complicated what if the DataFrame gets Transposed p  pI found an elegant solution would be to use custom objects instead of the usual names of the Series object. These MetaIndex are basically a string  metadata and would replace the usual column labels in mydataframe.columns The class definition looks something like thatp  precodeclass MetaIndex     def hashself         return self.str.hash      def eqself,other         return self.str  strother      def initself,st         self.str  formatnamest         self.meta  MetaData      def reprself         return self.str       def strself         return self.str codepre  pThen when I save the DataFrame in a hdf5 file, I change the MetaIndex into a regular string, and save each columns metadata separetely, and when I load the data, I reinstantiate the column of the dataframe with something likep  precodes.replacenamesbymetaindex     for c in s.columns         col  s[c]         if col.meta is not None             col.meta.setf[meta][strc] codepre  p1 Would you say its an advisable way to go, or is this a marginal and dangerous approach p  p2 Moreover, a very tempting extension is to have the MetaIndex inherit from str. In this way, the autocompletion still works with IPython mydataframe.col1. However, in this case, some simple operations like mydataframe.T.T make the MetaIndex lose all the metadata contained in index.meta as if behind the scene, the operation had reinstialized index.meta  dict. this looks very misterious to me, and thats also why I am worried about the whole approach.p  pAny clue about whats going on there  Thanks in advance, Best regards, Samuelp

Negative 116 pI been trying to figure this out for hours now. Ive searched for answers, but I cant find an answer. I have never bothered to ask before and this is the first time Im asking a question. Basically what I am doing is breaking up  my coding for organization purposes. The following snippet works just fine, but when I take it and place it into another class the urlConnect connects just fine. Ive marked it below.p  precodepublic String downloadUrlString strUrl throws IOException     String data       InputStream iStream  null     HttpURLConnection urlConnection  null      try         URL url  new URLstrUrl         String line             Creating an http connection to communicate with url          urlConnection  HttpURLConnection url.openConnection           Connecting to url          urlConnection.connect ltworks in this snippet           Reading data from url          iStream  urlConnection.getInputStream         BufferedReader br  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderiStream         StringBuffer sb   new StringBuffer          whileline  br.readLine  null             sb.appendline                  data  sb.toString         br.close          catchException e         Log.dException while downloading url, e.toString          finally          iStream.close         urlConnection.disconnect          return data  codepre  pSo this following snippet, is pretty much identical. But for some reason it doesnt want to connectp  precodepublic String getJSONobjectString strUrl throws IOException     String data       InputStream iStream  null     HttpURLConnection urlConnection  null      try         URL url  new URLstrUrl         String line           urlConnection  HttpURLConnection url.openConnection         urlConnection.connect    lt Does not work          iStream  urlConnection.getInputStream         BufferedReader br  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderiStream         StringBuffer sb   new StringBuffer          whileline  br.readLine  null             sb.appendline                  data  sb.toString         br.close         iStream.close                             catch MalformedURLException e1          e1.printStackTrace           catch IOException e1          e1.printStackTrace           finally          ifnull  urlConnection  urlConnection.disconnect           return data codepre  pThe LogCatp  precodegtat android.os.StrictModeAndroidBlockGuardPolicy.onNetworkStrictMode.java1131 gtat java.net.InetAddress.lookupHostByNameInetAddress.java385 gtat java.net.InetAddress.getAllByNameImplInetAddress.java236 gtat java.net.InetAddress.getAllByNameInetAddress.java214 gtat libcore.net.http.HttpConnection.ltinitgtHttpConnection.java70 gtat libcore.net.http.HttpConnection.ltinitgtHttpConnection.java50 gtat libcore.net.http.HttpConnectionAddress.connectHttpConnection.java340 gtat libcore.net.http.HttpConnectionPool.getHttpConnectionPool.java87 gtat libcore.net.http.HttpConnection.connectHttpConnection.java128 gtat libcore.net.http.HttpEngine.openSocketConnectionHttpEngine.java315 gtat libcore.net.http.HttpsURLConnectionImplHttpsEngine.makeSslConnectionHttpsURLConnectionImpl.java461 gtat libcore.net.http.HttpsURLConnectionImplHttpsEngine.connectHttpsURLConnectionImpl.java433 gtat libcore.net.http.HttpEngine.sendSocketRequestHttpEngine.java289 gtat libcore.net.http.HttpEngine.sendRequestHttpEngine.java239 gtat libcore.net.http.HttpURLConnectionImpl.connectHttpURLConnectionImpl.java80 gtat libcore.net.http.HttpsURLConnectionImpl.connectHttpsURLConnectionImpl.java165 gtat com.navsquad.shsu.katlas2.RouteJSONobject.getJSONobjectRouteJSONobject.java57 gtat com.navsquad.shsu.katlas2.CreateRoute.createCreateRoute.java41 gtat com.navsquad.shsu.katlas2.MainActivity3.onMapClickMainActivity.java84 gtat com.google.android.gms.maps.GoogleMap6.onMapClickUnknown Source gtat com.google.android.gms.internal.ta.onTransactUnknown Source gtat android.os.Binder.transactBinder.java326 gtat com.google.android.gms.maps.internal.IOnMapClickListenerStubProxy.onMapClickIOnMapClickListener.java93 gtat maps.i.s.bUnknown Source gtat maps.y.v.cUnknown Source gtat maps.y.bf.onSingleTapConfirmedUnknown Source gtat maps.d.v.onSingleTapConfirmedUnknown Source gtat maps.d.j.handleMessageUnknown Source gtat android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java99 gtat android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java137 gtat android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java5059 gtat java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method gtat java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java511 gtat com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java792 gtat com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java555 gtat dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Method codepre  pSo again to make it clear, all I was doing was making a separate class for my own organization. Originally I had a parser included in, but I have now split it up into different classes, so I can use other parsers with the stringJSON Object. If you could help me figure out what is different from before, I would appreciate. Original class was in an implemented AsyncTask Class.p

Negative 116 pI am trying to direct back to a page jerseyCollection if there is no value on price of total shop. Here is the code. I am including all the code because I think there is something crashing with onclickcheckOrder function which contains code to redirect user back to order page. Here is the code for function. I know checkOrder works because I have tried it with alert and i know redirecting statement works because I have tried it in other pages, too. But I just cant figure it out why it is not directing back to the shopping page even with no value in total shopping value.. Please help me figure this out. and how to solve this. p  precodefunction checkOrder var x  document.choice.realTotal.value      if x  false         alert Please do the shopping

Negative 116 pIve implemented a object that encapsulates a driver which interacts with external devices. When the driver receives data it emits an event.p  pWhen I start, I load a list of all defined drivers. Then I iterate through the definitions to do the followingp  ul licreate a driver instance, li lilisten for the events on the driver, andli litell the driver to connect.li ul  pAs a part of the listener for the emitted event I define a function that is passed some details on what the device represents.p  pHowever my code appears to have a problem. When a driver emits an event, the function that is fired only shows one set of details. These details are the last ones defined in the for loop where I create the drivers and listen for the events.p  pIve created a test example that recreates my problem by using a couple of simple objects and a timer. This will need to be run in node.js to see the problem.p  precodevar EventEmitter  requireevents.EventEmitter var util          requireutil   define vehicle object function Vehicleoptions      options  options       this.id  options.id  null  options.id  1     this.name  options.name  null  options.name  unknown   util.inheritsDriver, EventEmitter   define driver object function Driveroptions      options  options       this.id  options.id  null  options.id  1     this.name  options.name  null  options.name  unknown   Driver.prototype.startTimer  functiondelay      self  this      console.logstarting timer for   self.name   with a delay of   delay      setTimeoutfunction          console.logfiring timer for   self.name         self.emittimer, some data     , delay    function to create listener function makeOnTimerFunctiondriver, vehicle      console.logcreating function for d name    driver.name   d id   driver.id   v id   vehicle.id   v name   vehicle.name     return functiond          console.log d name   driver.name   d id   driver.id   v id   vehicle.id   v name   vehicle.name   d   d        var vehicles  new Array vehicles.pushnew Vehicleid 1001, name Max vehicles.pushnew Vehicleid 1002, name Cheif vehicles.pushnew Vehicleid 1003, name Seigfreid var driver  null  for var i  0 i lt 3 i       driver  new Driver         id vehicles[i].id,         name vehicles[i].name,           driver.ontimer, makeOnTimerFunctiondriver, vehicles[i]     driver.startTimer1000  i  codepre  pp  pThe output I get is as followsp  precodecreating function for d name  Max d id 1001 v id 1001 v name Max starting timer for Max with a delay of 0 creating function for d name  Cheif d id 1002 v id 1002 v name Cheif starting timer for Cheif with a delay of 1000 creating function for d name  Seigfreid d id 1003 v id 1003 v name Seigfreid starting timer for Seigfreid with a delay of 2000 firing timer for Seigfreid  d name Seigfreid d id 1003 v id 1003 v name Seigfreid d some data firing timer for Seigfreid  d name Seigfreid d id 1003 v id 1003 v name Seigfreid d some data firing timer for Seigfreid  d name Seigfreid d id 1003 v id 1003 v name Seigfreid d some data codepre  pWhat I expect to see is as followsp  precodecreating function for d name  Max d id 1001 v id 1001 v name Max starting timer for Max with a delay of 0 creating function for d name  Cheif d id 1002 v id 1002 v name Cheif starting timer for Cheif with a delay of 1000 creating function for d name  Seigfreid d id 1003 v id 1003 v name Seigfreid starting timer for Seigfreid with a delay of 2000 firing timer for Max  d name Max d id 1001 v id 1001 v name Max d some data firing timer for Chief  d name Chief d id 1002 v id 1002 v name Chief d some data firing timer for Seigfried  d name Seigfreid d id 1003 v id 1003 v name Seigfreid d some data codepre  pThe issue is that the timer is always referencing the last object, named Seigfreid.p  p edit p  pJust to make the problem clear the problem appears to be with the codemakeOnTimerFunctioncode function. The function it returns is the function to fire when an event occurs. When codemakeOnTimerFunctioncode is called, the variables all make sense. However when the event fires and the function returned by codemakeOnTimerFunctioncode is called then the variables are always the same. They do not reflect the values when codemakeOnTimerFunctioncode was first called.p

Negative 116 pThis is a slightly esoteric questions about how public to make constructors when using an IoC container. Im using java, Guice and Junit4, but Im sure this question is more general. p  pUnder Best Practices in the Guice docs, it says a hrefhttpscode.google.compgoogleguicewikiKeepConstructorsHidden relnofollowKeep constructors as hidden as possiblea. This is something I quite agree with, so I was happy to go ahead a make my constructors private and rely on Guice for instantiation. p  pHowever, this brings up an issue with mocking classes and unit testing. If all my constructors are private, then how can I instantiate something in a unit test and pass in a mocked dependency Having to create a new Guice module for every unit test seems like overkill to me. Surely, I must therefore actually make those constructors public. p  pWhich brings me to the question Given that DI is so useful when combined with unit testing, is the best practices in the Guice docs about keeping constructors hidden actually a mistake. p
Negative 116 pI have an MVC 3 application which is to be used  for both anonymous and authenticated users.p  pThis is accomplished by configuring IIS authentication mode to enable both anonymous and windows authentication, and then setting the authentication mode web.config setting to Windows and applying a custom authorization attribute selectively to actions that require the authentication check.p  pThe issue is that in some actions I dont need to apply the attribute so anonymous users can access it too, but in the case that an admin user is browsing it, then I want to retrieve his User.Identity.Name value.p  pThe application is behaving unpredictably, in some instances, once the user has been authenticated in a previous action, then the User.Identity.Name property remains available for the rest of the users session. However, in other instances, its coming up as an empty string.p  pSo, how do I actually tell the application to go and authenticate this user If the Authorize attribute can force the authentication of the user, then how can I achieve this same effect on demand within an actionp  pthanks for you help,p  pMp

For example, a comment may be inserted within johnp  precodeFrom John Doe ltjothis is a commenthndoe.orggt codepre  pAnd comments may be inserted in many other places.p  pHow to handle this complication Does it require a 2pass parser one pass to remove all comments and a second pass to create the parse tree for the From header Do modern parser generators support multiple passes on the input Can it be parsed in a single pass If yes, would you sketch the approach pleasep

There is a form that is bound to some fields of that table where the table will populate the fields.  So I type in a part and it will populate the description, average cost, and product code.p  pNow my question  Should I use a codeSELECTcode statement after I type in the part and use that statement to populate the form fields each time I check on a part  So a recordset will be created, set, then set to nothing each time.  Or should I run a codeSELECTcode statement for all the fields I will need from the table, set a recordset with those 26000 rows, then use code.FindFirstcode on that recordset each time  Which is quicker or which is correctp  pI may be going about this completely wrong too, but Im just trying to learn as I go.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 116 pSome context I am writing a 2D Destructible terrain library for Cocos2DBox2D which involves a hybrid of C and ObjectiveC. I recently encountered a situation that has stumped me where I cant think of a solution that doesnt involve parallel arrays.p  pIn order for the physics boundaries to be defined around the terrain, an initial trace must be made of the terrain border. I make a function call to trace all isolated bodies of pixels within a texture and cache them. This creates the following data structuresp  ul liAn NSMutableDictionary borderPixels with the key being equal to an CGPoint wrapped in an NSValue which is equal to the pixels unique location. This holds all traced pixels.li liA circular linked lists with TerPixels pointing to their next neighbor pixelli liAn NSMutableArray traceBodyPoints which holds a single TerPixel representing a start point of a terrain body. I only store TerPixel s here where I need to trace a physics body. So, if a terrain body has been modified, I insert any individual TerPixel  from the modified body into this array. I can then reference each of these and traverse the linked list to trace the physics body.li ul  pHere is some code to help paint a better picture of the situationp  precodevoidtraverseBoundaryPointsCGPointstartPt   if borderPixels borderPixels  [[NSMutableDictionary alloc] init]  Temp if traceBodyPoints traceBodyPoints  [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]  Temp  TerPixel  start  [[TerPixel alloc] initWithCoordsstartPt.x yptstartPt.y prevx1 prevy0] TerPixel  next  start CCLOGStart of traverseBoundary next.x and next.y d, d, next.x, next.y TerPixel  old   while true       old  next     next  [self findNextBoundaryPixelnext]     [next setNSP[old subTerPixelnext]]     old.nextBorderPixel  next      if next.x  start.x ampamp next.y  start.y          CCLOGSUCCESS  start  next         next.nextBorderPixel  start  Make the linked list circular         NSValue  pixLocVal  [next getAsValueWithPoint]         [borderPixels setObjectnext forKeypixLocVal]          Add the pixel to the tracePoints array to be traversedtraced later         [traceBodyPoints addObjectstart]         break       end if       Connect the linked list components      NSValue  pixLocVal  [next getAsValueWithPoint]     [borderPixels setObjectnext forKeypixLocVal]    end while   end traverse function codepre  pHere is where I cant find a solution. I need to relate each TerPixel  in the traceBodyPoints array to a Box2D b2Body which will be created and added to the physics world. In my library, each isolated body of pixels within a texture corresponds to a Box2D body. So, when an event happens that destroys a chunk of the terrain, I need to destroy the body associated the the destroyed pixels and retrace ONLY the altered bodies. This means I need a way to associate any given TerPixel  to a Box2D body .p  pIn ObjectiveC with ARC, to my knowledge, I cannot include C objectspointers in ObjectiveC containers without bridge casting to void s. Problem is these operations need to be incredibly performant and engaging in bridge casting is very costly. Also, I dont want to include a pointer to a Box2D body in every single TerPixel. This would be a nightmare to ensure there are no dangling pointers and require pointless iteration to nil pointers out.p  pHere is my logic for creating physics boundariesp  precodevoidcreatePhysicsBoundaries   if [selfgttraceBodyPoints count]  0       CCLOGcreatePhysicsBoundariesgt No bodies to trace     return    NEED LOGIC HERE TO DELETE ALTERED BODIES  NEED TO DELETE EXISTING BOX2D BODY AND RETRACE A NEW ONE   For each body that has been altered, traverse linked list to trace the body for TerPixel  startPixel in selfgttraceBodyPoints      TerPixel  tracePixel  startPixel.nextBorderPixel      b2BodyDef tDef     tDef.position.Set0, 0     b2Body  b  selfgtworldgtCreateBodyamptDef     selfgtgroundBodiesgtpushbackb     bgtSetUserDatabridge void self     b2EdgeShape edgeShape      CCLOGStartPixel d, d, startPixel.x, startPixel.y     while tracePixel  startPixel          b2Vec2 start  b2Vec2tracePixel.xPTMRATIO, tracePixel.yPTMRATIO         CCLOGTracePixel BEFORE d, d, tracePixel.x, tracePixel.y         tracePixel  tracePixel.nextBorderPixel         CCLOGTracePixel AFTER d, d, tracePixel.x, tracePixel.y         b2Vec2 end  b2Vec2tracePixel.xPTMRATIO, tracePixel.yPTMRATIO         edgeShape.Setstart,end         bgtCreateFixtureampedgeShape, 0       end while    end for   end createPhysicsBoundaries codepre  pHopefully this makes sense.

However since a featurebranch is created from codedevelop HEADcode and codedevelopcode may have already had other featurebranches merged back into, this gives a problem p  ul limerging the specific codefeature branchcode back into my own codedevelopcode is okli libut Im not sure how to do a clean pullrequest from this codefeature branchcode. I.e without all the codechanges of codeprevious feature branchescode that were merged into codedevelopcode before I started the current codefeature branchcode. I hope this makes sense.li ul  pIm pretty sure coderebasingcode doesnt help, since this only updates my local feature branch with commits of codeupstreamcode that happened in the meantime. It doesnt help to clean the local feature branch with inherited code changes from codedevelopcode. p  pSo, how to do thisp

I have done this in netbeans by choosing an exsisting controller when creating an empty FXML file.p  pI also have gave the nodes different id names, but the root controller does not recognize the nodes in these fxmls.p  pIs it possible to share the same controller for different fxmlsp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 116 pIve been playing around with caching objects by first creating my own cache which turned out a stable implementation but very inefficient and then trying my hand at using Memcached.p  pAlthough memcached works beautifully, Ive ran into a problem.p  pHow Im using my objects is as followsp  ul liI read data from a database into an object, then store the object in memcached.li liEvery couple of minutes I retrieve the object from memcached, retrieve any additional data from either the database or other objects in memcached, update the object with any new  relevant data, then store the object back into memcached.li liObjects that need to be viewed are pulled from memcached, packaged and sent onto a clientside application for display.li ul  pThis works very well, except when the number of objects Im creatingstoringupdatingviewing in memcached becomes high. JavaTomcatjvm doesnt seem to be garbagecollecting fast enough on the objects I pulled out of memcached, and the vm runs out of memory.p  pIm limited to 8GB of memory and would preferably like to bring that down to 4 if I can  using memcached, so my question is, is there a solution in preventing the JVMs memory usage from expanding so fast or tune the garbage collectorp  pPS I have considered using Guava cache from Google, but this limits my options in concurrency e.g. if I have to restart tomcat, and using both Guava and memcached seems like a duplication of sorts which Id like to avoid of possiblep  p Hein.p

Negative 116 pI have three python object databases which Ive constructed through the ZODB module, which I would like to merge into one. The reason I have three and not one is because each object belongs to one of three populations, and was added to the database once my code conducted an analysis of said object. The analysis of each object can definitely be done in parallel. My code takes a few days to run, so to prevent this from being a week long endeavor, I have three computers each processing objects from one of the three populations, and outputting a single ZODB database once it has completed. I couldnt have three computers adding the analysis of objects from different populations to the emsameem database because of the way ZODB handles conflicts. Essentially, until you close the database, it is locked from the inside.  p  pMy questions are 1 How can I merge multiple .fs database files into a single master database The structure of each database is exactly the same  meaning the dictionary structures are the same between each. As an example, MyDB may represent the ZODB database structure of the first populationp  precoderoot.[MyDB][ID123456][property1]         ...

The names of the keys property1, property2, etc., are all the same for each IDXXXXXX key within the database, though the values will certaily vary.p  p2 What would have been the smarter thing to do to run this code in parallel while still resulting in a single ZODB structure p  pPlease let me know if clarification is needed.p  pThanksp

Tables that i have is a parent table and an association for an another table which contains the children of the parent table.p  pIn same session i do the following items in the sequence mentioned below  Initially in the session we will not have the parent object or the child object .But parent object will be there in the DB and children will be added in the method that we are interested in .p  ol liI get the parent object from the DB in the session so this parent object will be in the session.li liI create a new child record and associate this child to the parent table, since the parent is part of the session hibernate must take care of adding the child record in the child table correct li liThen i will perform a flush at this point.li liAgain i will add a new child to the collection of the parent li liAs said before hibernate must take care of adding it rite li liI am performing the flush again now .li liAt the end of the EJB transaction the hibernate will generate all the other sql statements.li ol  pAfter performing these operations i see that in the DB only the child that is added second time is getting associated to the parent table.But for the first child entry is present but the parent association is not getting set .p  pIf i remove the flush in between adding the children both the children are getting correctly associated to the parent .Flush is causing an issue here , but i have to use flush here at any cost because take into consideration i am associating 100 children once shot then perform a flush and later i will associate another 10 children and then do a flush only the last 10 children are associated to the parent all others are in orphan stage .This is causing a issue for me p  pPlease comment back on how to solve this issue .Should i perform some other operations like update or saveOrUpdate before the flush p  pTHE algorithm is here please find it  Since the code is big and long i will be posting the algorithm of how the operation is performed Assume i have 2 tables one for the parent named PARENT and the other for the child named CHILD   And the child entity is extended from the parent entity Assume that initially i have only one parent record in the DB and there is no CHILD records in the child table There is a bidirectional link between the child and the parent onetomany and vice verse. At the start of the transaction i ll get the parent data frm the DB so that the parent gets associated to the Persistence Context . Now assume i am creating a new POGO object of the child and fill its data. Assume that i will create 20 such objects and then associate both bidirectional the child to parent and parent to child. Since the parent is in hibernate context when i associate it to child hibernate will take care of creating and making the link . Now assume i do a flush on the session context . Next i create 10 more POGO objects of the child and do the same association to parent , and carry out a flush again. after the end of transaction when i check the DB i see that the first 20 entries are there in the DB but the association for them to parent is absent. But for the last added 10 Child objects both the entries and the association for the parent is there.  When i remove the flush in between adding the child between 20 and 10 i see that all the 30 are correctly getting associated. I want to know why the flush is causing the problemp  pThank you in advance p

I wonder if a there are clashes between the different JS scripts, maybe theyd need to come in different order have to ask ImpactStory about this or b there are some problems in how xtable generates the output or c Shiny does not know how to communicate with the impactstory.js script or d Shiny does not see the script at all. Should I build a custom output component p  pEDIT2 AFAIK the problem lies in the fact that the reactively outputted table does not see the JavaScript. Tested when I manually add nondynamic HTML code to ui.R with all the attributes that the ImpactStory JS needs to know about an article, the widgets are rendered ok. Also, if I add, in server.R, the script element in the data frame that is outputted, the widgets are rendered, but also  will never stop doing it, resulting to a loop   I suppose what Id need is similar to what is asked a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comdmsgshinydiscussZaYYmFLHA6UCvjEmLnz5pgJ relnofollowhere, in question nr 2a p

Negative 116 pI succesfully followed the guides on a hrefhttpdocs.wso2.orgdisplayClusterClusteringApplicationServer relnofollowhttpdocs.wso2.orgdisplayClusterClusteringApplicationServera and have deployed an scenario of one ELB 2.1.0 balancing and connecting the nodes as followsbrbr   One machine with the ELB, Manager and Worker nodebr   Another physical different machine with another worker nodep  pAll the managing on the ELB and manager and workers seems to be fine, for the logs and the console show every member connecting to each other, and so.p  pMy problem is that if I configure the proxyPort properties on the Catalinaserver.xml of the Manager and the workers node, I cant connect trhough the ports on the ELB 8280 or 8243, because I am obtaining a blank page if i try to use the manager administration console or a blank webserver response if I try to consume any webservice through the ELB port.p  pIf I dont configure the proxyPorts properties on each node, and point to each IP and port separately, I can successfully use the manager console, and consume the WebServices on each worker node as I expected but...of course, this way I am not having Load Balance and High Availability.p  pSorry to bother you because Im new at this matters, but I searched the internet all around and have found how to fix problems all the way through this point Im in...

But, if we dont change the  on the axis2.xml working with the 5.2.0 and 2.1.0 versions, trying to replicate the status we have with the previous version, the ELB doesnt realice that a manager and worker are connecting to him we cant see anything on the ELB logs when launching the manager and Worker, so I suppose in this case the clustering is not working, and for it to work properly, we need to set the  in the Axis2.xml of the loadbalancer the same as in the loadbalancer.conf and in the axis2.xml of the rest of nodes in the cluster.p  pWe need to deploy this for testing and valoration purposes on a customer and we would like to understand or to know if there is something wrong with the last versions, or this is just a lack of knowledge for our part, case when we will need the help of this forum .p  pIn this link you could find the configuration files involved in the ELB 2.1.0 and Manager WSAS 5.2.0 issue a hrefhttpwww.dravencrow.comvariosconfigurationfiles.rar relnofollowhttpwww.dravencrow.comvariosconfigurationfiles.rarap  pThank you very much in advancep

Negative 116 pIm writing a basic sound lab to make experiments around audio generation using digital oscillators.p  pMy oscillator works perfectly for a fixed frequency. However, in my program I have a slider to change frequency on the run. The frequency changes however, I can hear a small glitch everytime I switch the frequency. This is probably due to the abrupt frequency change.p  pI have written a control code to make my frequency change gradually until it reaches the desired frequency but something is not working correctly and I cant figure what.p  pEverytime a new frequency is set I determine the difference between the actual frequency and the new one. Then, I divide that difference for 44100 which is my sample rate, in order to have a second. Im using a second to be able to understand the progress of the frequency change. p  pWhat happens is that I hear the frequency increasing but when it reaches the target frequency, the audible frequency seems to get down a bit. This is really awkward because if I output the value of the frequency that is being sent to the sinewave calculation, everything is just fine, no unexpected steps are being generated.p  pThis is the code of the oscillator class. This frequency change control process is only working for an increasing frequency right nowp  precodeOscillatorOscillatorint freq, int sr     sampleIndex0,     chaseTargetFrequencyfalse,     frequencyChangedfalse      currentFrequencyfreq     frequencyfreq     sampleRatesr   void Oscillatorprocessunsigned char out      float t  qrealsampleIndex  sampleRate  sampleRate      if frequencyChanged              frequencyinc          if frequencygtcurrentFrequency                      frequencyChanged  false                    qreal x  0       SINEWAVE     x  0.5f  qSin2.f  MPI  frequency  t      qint16 value  staticcastltqint16gtx  32767     qToLittleEndianltqint16gtvalue, out      sampleIndex   void OscillatorsetFrequencyint value      if frequencyChanged         return      currentFrequency  value     inc  currentFrequencyfrequency44000.f     frequencyChanged  true  codepre  pDoes anybody as a clue of why this isnt working as expected I hope my language was clear enough during the problem explanation.p  pThanks in advance, p  pWith my best regards,p  pNuno Santosp
Negative 116 pAlright I am in a rather difficult situation, or at least I think so anyway. I have been doing some research on how to fix my problem but have really come up empty handed.p  pI need to be able to reindex the rowid of my table after I delete a row. That way at any given time when I want to update or index a row by the rowid it is accessing the correct one.p  pNow for those of you asking why. Basically I am interfacing a homebrewed db that was programmed in C and is really just a bunch of memory locations all accessed like they were a db table. So what Im trying to say is they can look up a row by searching for a value in the table, or by simply saying i want row 6. Lastly the table could consist of really anything, and any values which means they dont create a column as an index and ultimately the only thing for me to index their row by row number is the rowid to my knowledge.p  pSo I have found that VACUUM would do what I want or need but it appears that the system that database is in isnt giving sqlite privileges to write so when VACUUM is run it comes back with and error. ERROR 14 or Unable to open the database file I also know that my db is open so that isnt the issue but not having write privileges is the only reason I can come up with I have also read some stuff about the auto increment or something like that but didnt really understandthink that was going to be able to fix my problem.p  pAny suggestions or ideas from the sqlite or database geniuses out that would be appreciated. p

Every sample code and tutorial Ive found on the internet so far, seems to concentrete on using external identity providers, like Google, and not so much on self developed solutions. Also, they seem to include web pages for entering credentials, which is not what Id like to do.

Negative 116 pIve got a problem with MappedByteBuffer specially how it works internally. The way I understand it the caching is done completely by the Operating System. So if I read from the file using MappedByteBuffer the OS will read whole pages from the hard drive and saves the page in RAM for faster access when needed again. This also allows to provide a shared cache for multiple applicationsprocesses which access the same file. Is this correctp  pIf so, how is it possible to invalidate this cache Just reinitializing the MappedObject shouldnt work. I have written an application which reads a lot from the hard drive. I need to do a few benchmarks, so I need to clear this cache when needed. Ive tried to use echo 3  procsysvmdropcaches but this doesnt make a difference so I think it is not working. p

Negative 116 pWithout Teamcity I would put everything into one big .fsx script and just fire and forget it. It would be OK to have a single script for the build, doing all the work.p  pBut when we put .fsx script into Teamcity, everything changed. Teamcity has nice build log and build steps features, but putting all logic into the same script and build step resulted in strongHUGEstrong build log.p  pWe have build and tests in a single .fsx script, and I was going to place distributive building into it either. But now I dont think that this is a great idea. Perhaps it would be better to split this build script into several build scripts and run them in several build steps p  pBut with several scripts its not too convenient to run build locally, without Teamcity if we need to. Or we can have several small build scripts for every task ans one build script for the local build calling all these small scripts. p  pWhat is the best solution for thisp

Negative 116 pWhen Apache codemoddircodes codeDirectorySlashcode mechanism 301s a request that maps to a directory but that was missing its trailing slash, it produces a response body of type codetexthtmlcode, whatever the codeAcceptcode header of the request. While I understand that pretty much every client will just use the codeLocationcode header in the response to work out where to go, Im wondering if its possible to customise the response body to produce something other than codetexthtmlcode. In my specific case, Im getting codeapplicationrdfxmlcode or codetextturtlecode requests and returning likeencoded RDF responses. Id like to be able to handle these missingslash 301s with a response such as thisp  precodeprefix owl lthttpwww.w3.org200207owlgt. base lthttpwww.example.comgt.  ltresourcegt owlsameAs ltresourcegt. codepre  pIve tried using rewrite rules and codeErrorDocumentcode in the code.htaccesscode file like thisp  precodeDirectorySlash off  RewriteEngine on RewriteOptions AllowNoSlash   When no trailing slash, redirect to slashed path with a special ttl response body ErrorDocument 301 resourceseeother.ttl RewriteCond HTTPAccept textturtle RewriteCond REQUESTURI resource RewriteRule . resource [L,R301]   When textturtle request with trailing slash, return resource RewriteCond HTTPAccept textturtle RewriteCond REQUESTURI resource RewriteRule . index.ttl [L] codepre  pThis works OK. But it stops working as soon as I need to handle the cases for other content types. Although I can add another set of rewrite rules without any problems, I cant repeat the codeErrorDocumentcode directive in the code.htaccesscode file only the last such directive in the file will actually apply, resulting in all 301 responses getting the same response body.p  pI suppose if I wasnt restricted to code.htaccesscode I might be able to use codeltLocationgtcode directives which would isolate the codeErrorDocumentcodes from each other.p  pSo is there a way to do content negotiation on error response bodiesp

Negative 116 pI created a very basic login application. The LOGINURL, LOGINREDIRECTURL and the LOGOUTURL work just fine. p  pThe thing is that if i log in succesully and then i close the window browser and then i reopen the browser, i can perfectly search the url the one i am supose to only see if i am logged in and use the applcation without loggin in again. This is not where it ends if i open 2 separate browsers Chrome and Firefox at the same time and i only logged in in ONE, i can use the applicaction from the other browser without problems. I dont want this to happend. I tried using loginrequired in the urls.conf for the index view the page that you can only see if you are logged in and in the class view, i tried using stronhold, and djangobraces. Is ther any other way to do this. If you want to see any of the code let me know. Im using the login and log out that django implements auth. Than youp

So far everything is good until I need to display the data. p  pHow do I return the value from the facet in its original case, example codeFordcode, codeChevroletcode etc rather than codefordcode, codechevroletcode p  pIs there an efficient way to get the value from the database by returning the pk from the value and build an actual object from the database Or is it recommended to store the value in the index in its original format and do a getFacetQuery to get it I dont know anything about the emgetFacetQueryem, so this might not be possible.p  pexamplep  precodeEntity public class Make   Fieldstore  Store.no private String name   codepre  pvalues p  precodedatabase ChevyFord index chevyford codepre  pfacetp  precodepublic FacetingRequest getMakeFacetRequestQueryBuilder builder      return builder.facet         .namemake         .onFieldmake.name         .discrete         .orderedByFacetSortOrder.FIELDVALUE         .includeZeroCountsfalse         .maxFacetCount10         .createFacetingRequest   codepre  pResultsp  precodechevyford codepre  pHowever Id like the original case from the database. p  pPlease recommend a best practice.

Negative 116 pI am trying to build a fast 8bit greyscale PNG encoder. Unfortunately I must be misunderstanding part of the spec.

Negative 116 pI have a String ArrayList consisting alphabets followed by a digit as a suffix to each of the alphabet.p  precodeArrayList ltStringgt baseOctave  new ArrayList baseOctave.addS1 baseOctave.addR2 baseOctave.addG4 baseOctave.addM2 baseOctave.addP3 baseOctave.addD1 baseOctave.addN1 codepre  pI pass the strings from this baseOctave and few other characters as input pattern for creating an object.     MyClass obj1  new MyClass S1,,R2.,M2 Since I frequently make use of these kind of input patterns during object instantiation, I would like to use simple characters S, R, G, M etc. Exp  precode   MyClass obj1  new MyClass S,,R.,M     MyClass obj2  new MyClass S1,G.,M,D1 codepre  pSo the alphabets used during object creation may contain digits as suffix or it may not have digit as suffix.p  pBut inside the constructor or in separate method, I would like to replace these simple alphabets with alphabets having suffix.

Negative 116 pI am looking for a way to detect when a page is reloaded after clicking the back button, so I can selectively ignore errors. Let me explain whyp  pImagine a page that displays some data, identified by an idp  precodeshowsomedataid5 codepre  pInitially, the id exists and the page is displayed. If the id does not exist, an error message is shown and an error is logged, because that should not happen and would indicate a broken link in the application.p  pNow imagine the user looks at the data, decides to delete it, and after deleting, uses the back button to go to the same page again BTW this is not a hypothetical, I have seen this in my application. Now, the id is no longer valid, triggering an error. If I could distinguish between the initial page load and the second page load after using the back button, I could be more lenient in my error handling. My reasoning being that a broken forward link in the application is a fatal error. A broken link after clicking back when there was none initially is very likely caused by some action the user took in the meantime. In that case I would much rather redirect the user to an overview page than show an application error.p  pI believe one way to solve this would be to attach some randomly generated id to the urlp  precodeshowsomedataid5amprndltphp print rand gt codepre  pand log the random ids that have been used in the session. If an id repeats itself, I can assume that the page has been reloaded, and selectively ignore some errors.p  pHowever, that would require altering many links in the application. I could also use javascriptjQuery to alter all links on the page to the same effectp  precodea.attrhref, function i, h      return h  h.indexOf  1  amp    rnd  Math.random   codepre  pThats slightly less invasive, but still rather heavy handed for solving such a seemingly trivial problem. I wonder if there is or can be a selfcontained way to do this. Is there any way for the backend application to distinguish if a page is loaded by forward clicking on a link or reloaded after clicking back Or is there a more elegant solution with javascriptp

Negative 116 pI have a view with some tableviews and some collection views and also some buttons and labels.p  pIm not sure if this is new with Xcode 6.1 because I have not worked on the ui aspect of this project for some time.  However, when I try to resize just about anything in the view, my tableviews and collection views, and possibly some other elements I am not noticing, get deleted.  Specifically, it seems their frame or rect propertied get deleted.p  pTo be clear, this only occurs when I attempt to resize the element by dragging the sides in interface builder.  If I resize them by changing the numbers directly either in the IB sidebar or in the xml, this does not happen.p  pIm wondering if this is a bug in Xcode or if I have done something to cause this behavior which I can change.p  pThanksp
Negative 116 pIm having a problem where I am able to retrieve two cookies from a login call from one web service but both cookies are stripped from any requests made to a different web service.p  pA little background I have a Windows service .NET 4.5 that needs to send data to another companies web service interface.

Both cookies must be included in every request.p  pIf I call any of the methods in service A both cookies are included in the request. Using Fiddler I have been able to verify this.

Negative 116 pHi guys  I have a tricky error that I cant solve. Im working on a listview and when location services are active I wanna that if location is turned on I watch time to go in a place, and when location services are off I will display a message instead of time. Nothing special. But I have a tricky error like, if I have GPS, so fine location, works, if I have all location turned off, works, but If I have coarse location active, the app crash...this is really tricky. Below my code and my logcat.

Negative 116 ptldr I need a way to find Foreign Nearest Neighbors using a KDTree or some other spatial data structure. i.e find the nearest neighbor in a subset of the tree.p  pI built a MST algorithm that uses a KDTree to find nearest neighbors. However eventually it needs to look beyond nearest neighbors and into Nearest Foreign Neighbors as to connect distant nodes. My first approach simply iteratively increases knn parameter until the query returns a node in the subset.

Also there are 50 shades of gray 100 if you count duplicates but the Ansi indexed colors have 23 so it doesnt seem to be the same. If these in some way do contain the colors in the ansi extended color index does anyone have a list of which names are in which indexp  pPS.

Negative 116 pI was trying my hand with recyclerview and floating action button for an app. The problem I encountered is that the floating action button hinders with the buttons in recyclerview. I looked up how the android apps such as phone appone where you have contacts displayed in gridvew are designed to deal with this, I see that there is empty space left in the bottom which gives space between recyclerview and floating action button, user just needs to scroll to the bottom to avoid the overlap. I tried to add a view after recyclerview but not its not getting displayed, also this view should move along with the recyclerview rows.

Negative 116 pI am supposed to write a trigger that updates an attriubute in one of my tables. More specific I have an orders table with the attributes orderID, customerID, date, value and an order items table with the attributes orderID, articleID, quantity.  value in orders is the combined value of an order, which means the sum of price  quantity of every oder item. The trigger is now supposed to keep the attribute value updated whenever I update, insert or delete anything in order items. My trigger body for INSERT and DELETE looks like thisp  precodeIF INSERTING THEN   UPDATE Orders   SET value  value  SELECT NEW.quantity articles.price                            FROM articles                            WHERE articles.articleID  NEW.articleID   WHERE Orders.OrderID NEW.OrderID END IF  IF DELETING THEN   UPDATE Orders   SET value  value  SELECT OLD.quantity  articles.price                            FROM articles                            WHERE articles.articleID  OLD.articleID   WHERE Orders.OrderID OLD.OrderID END IF codepre  pNow we have the UPDATING case left. Here lies my problem when INSERTING a new order item, the value of course increases, so I can just add the new value to the old one, like I did above. Same for DELETING I can just subtract the value of the deleted row. But for update it gets tricky Depending on whether the UPDATE statement increases or decreases the quantity, changes the article ID meaning the price increases or decreases, or does both, the value will increase or decrease. My approach so far was using many different IF clauses to deal with this IF OLD.quantity lt NEW.quantity then ... , but this cant be the right approach. Does anyone have an ideap

Negative 116 pFinished watching thoughtprovoking video Composable application architecture with reasonably priced monads from Rnar Bjarnason, I started to write the examples provided in the video in Scalaz. I am having a little surprise when implementing the writer based interpreter for the Interact App. Here is the code,p  precodesealed trait Interact[A]  case class Askprompt String extends Interact[String]  case class Tellmsg String extends Interact[Unit]  type W[A]  scalaz.Writer[Vector[String], A]  object ConsoleW extends Interact gt W    def apply[A]i Interact[A]  i match      case Askprompt gt       printlnprompt       WriterVectorprompt, readLine     case Tellmsg gt       printlnmsg       WriterVector.empty,      codepre  pWhen I tried to lift ConsoleW into an interpreter for the interact free monad, the compiler hinted me lack of context bound of Functor to W. I am quite surprised since Writer itself is a monad, the functor context bound should be given for free. Ok so I had to explicitly write a functor,p  precodeimplicit val functor  new Functor[W]    def map[A, B]fa Writer[Vector[String], A]f A gt B      fa.mapf  codepre  pwhich is pretty dumb... since I basically did nothing other than calling the map method of Writer itself. Now I can lift ConsoleW into an interpreter. However when I tried to foldMap the interact program with ConsoleW, the compiler again hinted the lack of Monad context bound for W Ok, this is totally unexpected, let me spoonfeed you, Scalac...p  precodeval prg Free[type f[x]  Coyoneda[Interact, x]f, Unit]    import scalaz.std.vector.  implicit val monad  new scalaz.Monad[W]    def point[A]a gt A  Writer[Vector[String], A]Vector.empty, a   def bind[A, B]fa Writer[Vector[String], A]f A gt Writer[Vector[String], B]       fa.flatMapf   prg.foldMapCoyoneda.liftTFConsoleW codepre  pNow everything compiles, and the Writer Monad can record all the prompts into vector when the program runs.

Negative 116 pI followed the PaintCode tutorials on StyleKit and Ive successfully exported icons into a Swift project code only  MyStyleKit.swift file. Im trying to understand the relationship between the UIImage generated in code and the image sizes expected for different iOS devices.p  pI wired up the MyStyleKit object in the storyboards to the image for the Tab bar icon. Works great but I cant tell if the resolution of the image is adjusting depending on the device. Apples HIG suggests the tab bar icon size in pixels should be  75 x 75 px for 3x images iphone6 50 x 50 px for 2x retina image 25 x 25 px for nonretinap  pFirstly what canvas size should I be choosing in PaintCode initially I guessed at putting the canvas size as 25 x 25, reasoning that I should map to the UI points size.p  pWhen I rig up the icon in Storyboards does it automatically adjust to whether it needs 3x, 2x or 1xp  pShould I be setting the canvas size to the UI points size p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 116 pI have an activity that includes a WebView as part of the layout. When the activity is started it loads a template HTML file which is configured to use MathJax based on Learthrums minimal Android installation.p  pThe HTML file contains an empty Div element placeholder.p  pI have overridden the onLoad function for the default WebViewClient to run some Javascript code on the loaded file. The code inserts Latex math into the Div element and then uses MathJax to format it.p  pThe program displays different math problems in this Div.p  pThe problem is the first problem subsequent changes have no issues, this includes the reload that occurs on rotation.p  pIn general it is too slow. I realize this may not be solvable, so what I would like is for the WebView to be completely blank until the processed math is done and then have it show up. This would be acceptable even with the delay.p  pI have tried a number of different solutions, including, for example, setting the preview text to none the initial problem was the unformatted Latex appearing.p  pI have also tried starting the Div as visibilityhidden and then calling the MathJax processing with a function that shows the Div after the processing is done in the queue.p  pThe problem I keep running into now is that yes the WebView is empty but something is happening during the first run of processing. You can see flashing gray bars underneath and then to the right of the Div like something is being selected and you are seeing the borders of the selection.p  pI am convinced it is a timing issue. For example, if I dont have it load the first math problem automatically, but do the exact same thing with a button, there is no problem the first time.p  pThrough some debugging I was able to see that MathJax.isReady is not set when I first process it.p  pI have tried some strange convoluted solutions such as listening for End on the Startup from the MathJax Signal system in my HTML file, then having that call a function in the activity that then writes the Javascript back to the file. But this never quite worked. Part of the problem seems to be that the MathJax queue is not really empty possibly when this happens but running Javascript on the HTML from my activity kills the rest of the queue. Maybe. I even tried just returning the Latex string as a return value from the Activity function back to the HTML that called it after receiving the signal from MathJax, and then putting putting a function in the queue to write the Latex t the Div and then process it and then unhide it, but that either still showed the flashing or did nothing I have made endless small changes to settings to try and get some combination to work.p  pA longwinded explanation, but I wanted to give a lot of detail about what I had already tried.p  pDoes anyone have a good solution for how to get the timing right Or other solutions for having nothing show at all until the formatted math appearsp

Negative 116 pIve been working on a way of producing compiletime information about classes that wrap other classes in C. In a minimal example of the problem I am about to ask about, such a wrapper class p  ul licontains a codetypedef WrappedTypecode defining the type of the wrapped class andli lioverloads a struct template called codeIsWrappercode to indicate that it is a wrapper class. li ul  pThere is a struct template called codeWrapperTraitscode that can then be used to determine the nonwrapper root type of a hierarchy of wrapped types. E.g. if the wrapper class is a class template called codeWrapperltTgtcode, the root type of codeWrapperltWrapperltintgtgtcode would be codeintcode.p  pIn the code snippet below, I have implemented a recursive struct template called codeGetRootTypeltTgtcode that defines a codetypedef RootTypecode that gives the root type of wrapper type codeTcode. The given definition of codeWrapperTraitscode just contains the root type as defined by codeGetRootTypecode, but in practice it would have some additional members. To test it, I have written an ordinary function codefcode that takes an codeintcode, and an overloaded function template codefcode that takes an arbitrary wrapper class that has codeintcode as its root type. I have used SFINAE to distinguish between them, by using codestdenableifcode in the function templates return type to check whether or not codefcodes arguments root type is codeintcode if codefcodes argument is not a wrapper, attempting to determine its root type will fail. Before I ask my question, here is the code snippetp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include lttypetraitsgt    Wrapper   templateltclass Tgt struct Wrapper typedef T WrappedType  templateltclass T, class Enablevoidgt struct IsWrapper stdfalsetype   templateltclass Tgt struct IsWrapperltWrapperltTgt gt stdtruetype     WrapperTraits   templatelt   class T,   bool HasWrapper     IsWrapperltTgtvalue ampamp IsWrapperlttypename TWrappedTypegtvaluegt struct GetRootType    staticassertIsWrapperltTgtvalue,T is not a wrapper type    typedef typename TWrappedType RootType   templateltclass Tgt struct GetRootTypeltT,truegt    typedef typename GetRootTypelttypename TWrappedTypegtRootType RootType   templateltclass Tgt struct WrapperTraits    typedef typename GetRootTypeltTgtRootType RootType     Test function   void fint    stdcoutltltintltltstdendl    define ROOTTYPEACCESSOR WrapperTraits   lt Causes compilation error. define ROOTTYPEACCESSOR GetRootType     lt Compiles without error.  templateltclass Tgt auto fT gt    typename stdenableiflt     stdissameltint,typename ROOTTYPEACCESSORltTgtRootTypegtvalue   gttype    typedef typename ROOTTYPEACCESSORltTgtRootType RootType    stdcoutltltWrapperlt...ltintgt...gtltltstdendl   fRootType    int main    fWrapperltintgt     return 0   codepre  pThis compiles correctly a hrefhttpsideone.comyXn4Oo relnofollowtry it herea and produces the outputp  precodeWrapperlt...ltintgt...gt int codepre  pHowever, I have used codeGetRootTypecode to determine the root type in the call to codestdenableifcode.

Negative 116 pIn my application there is a ExpandableListView in which I need to do with contextual action menu an action on several children of several groups. p  pIn my research Ive found that multichoice on expandable list views is not possible or really hard to implement. So Ive decided to implement my custom solution as follows Ive posted the code bellow for clarification, it is a draft of the code, it is not final, Ive just implemented  hard coded some things to see if it works or notp  ul liI open the contextual action menu on a click on a child, I put a tick on the childs view and I change the background of that childli liI open the same contextual action menu on every click on every childli lithe closing of the contextual menu I havent implemented yet I wanted to see if this works beforeli liI than would do the action extracting the children from a Map corresponding to the map that I give to the adapterli limy code works until I click on another group to selected another childli lithen, when I open another group the selected children the tick and the background moves to the children in that group I just opened the respective group to select something and the last selected items got unselectedli liI posted screenshots to clarifyli lipI havent observed any pattern of the behaviour p  pI dont know why this is happening.pli ul  pthe adapterp  precodepublic class CoordinateExpandableListAdapter extends BaseExpandableListAdapter   private

Negative 116 pJust started working with SAML yesterday and have run into all sorts of issues, most of which I worked out.  However, one that I still have not is how to turn off discovery so Spring auto redirects to the IdP I only have one and have also set it to default when any protected resource is accessed.  I see in Springs docs that you can easily turn off discovery, however the docs seem to be lacking in examples andor details, so I am not totally sure how to do it.p  pThus far, I have tried setting the idpSelectionPath to empty, as well as using includeDiscoveryExtension and idpDiscoveryEnabled set to false.  Using the direct URL contextsamlloginidpIDP does work, but is not an option as my requirement is for any protected URL to auto redirect to the IdP if the user is not signed in.p  pThe below is a working version of my securityContext.xml file, as some of the changes I made such as removing all the discovery settings caused a browser error of an endless loop to occur.  Any and all help is appreciated.

Negative 116 pI am working with ZMQ and am running into issues when destroying a context.p  pI have the codep  precodezmqctxshutdowncontext zmqctxtermcontext codepre  pThis code always blocks on codezmqctxtermcode and will also block with codezmqctxdestoycode however, if that call is removed and only the shutdown call is used, everything seems to work fine, but the application will leak memory from not freeing the zmq context.p  pIn my code, I have four sockets two codeZMQPAIRcode codeinproccode sockets that are used to communicate between the main thread and a thread with a codeZMQREPcode socket, along with a codeZMQPUBcode that runs on the main thread.p  pI have set codeZMQLINGERcode on all of these sockets to 0, as it seems the only time the codezmqctxtermcode call should block is if messages have not yet been sent since I have called codezmqclosecode on all sockets, which returns without errors. Additionally, this blocking still occurs if I only call codezmqctxnewcode, create the sockets, then call codezmqctxshutdown zmqctxtermcode.p  pMy fear is that something is wrong with using the two codeinproccode sockets to communicate between threads with the same zmq context, although there doesnt seem to be any issues with the communication as messages are being received.p  pAfter fearing that I may have some issue with thread safety, I found that the ZMQ context should be threadsafe, but not the sockets. I have checked and in the main thread, I am opening an closing the codeZMQPUBcode socket and codeinproccode socket. In another thread, I am opening and closing the codeZMQREPcode socket and other end of the codeinproccode socket, so it seems like that shouldnt be an issue.p  pFor clarification, I am writing my code in C using libzmq from the current master branch on GitHub commit d35473e. I did see a similar on issues when linking ZMQs shared library, although this is occurring whether I use the static or shared library.

The problem also appears and disappears randomly if I make changes to the compiler optimisation options e.g. if I change from codeO3code or codeOfastcode.

Negative 116 pTo be clear Im aware that the below example demonstrates a dlldependancy, i.e. one library is not selfcontaine, but depends on another library to function.p  pLets say Im creating a runtime library, Utility.dll, which contains various useful functions of general nature. I create a header file Utility.h to be included in other files which need to use Utility.dll. The header file looks likep  precodeifndef UTILITYH define UTILITYH  ifdef BUILDDLL define DLLEXPORT declspecdllexport else define DLLEXPORT declspecdllimport endif  DLLEXPORT void foo DLLEXPORT void foo2 ....  endif codepre  pWhen I compile the source code file Utility.cpp into machine code into Utility.dll I make sure BUILDDLL is defined so DLLEXPORT gets replaced with declspecdllexport. This makes the functions be exported to the .dll file. Whenever I include the header Utility.h and link with the import library Utility.lib for MS VS, libUtility.a for g and do strongnotstrong define BUILDDLL, the function declarations in Utility.h begin with declspecdllimport instead, telling the compiler that the functions are imported from a .dll so to speak.p  pNow, lets say Im also building stronganotherstrong library, MyLibrary.dll, which wants to use some of the useful functions in Utility.dll. Similarily, I would create MyLibrary.h asp  precodeifndef MYLIBRARYH define MYLIBRARYH  ifdef BUILDDLL define DLLEXPORT declspecdllexport else define DLLEXPORT declspecdllimport endif  DLLEXPORT void myLibraryFunc1 ....  endif codepre  pWhen I compile MyLibrary.cpp into MyLibrary.dll Im including Utility.h and also linking against the Utility import library.p  pThis leads us to my strongquestionstrong Since I define BUILDDLL also when I compile MyLibrary.dll, this means that the function declarations in Utility.h also will readp  precodedeclspecdllexport void foo declspecdllexport void foo2 .... codepre  pNotp  precodedeclspecdllimport void foo declspecdllimport void foo2 codepre  pDont we want it to be declspecdllimport for the function declarations in Utility.h when we compile MyLibrary.dll, and declspecdllexport for the function declarations in MyLibrary.hp

Negative 116 pDISCLAIMER I know other people on this site have had this error but its been in different contexts and the fixes dont seem to work here. p  pHey stackoverflow, Basically Ive been making a sideways space invaders game, where your ship follows your mouses Y position but stays on the left, and clicking shoots a bullet. Enemies spawn randomly from the right and fly to the left, and objects are removed once they each the side of the screen. This all works fine, however when I tried to implement collision detection to see when the shot hits the enemy, I get the errorp  precodeTypeError Argument must be rect style object. codepre  pIt points to the line return hitbox.colliderecttarget.rect. To try and work out what was causing this I made some print lines below it to see what target.rect was and whether it was a proper rect object, and it seemed to be exactly the same style as the shots own rect, so Im completely lost as to why colliderect doesnt accept it.p  pIve annotated pretty much everything, sorry if its an insult to your intelligence but it should make things easier. p  pClass that causes problemsp  precodeclass gameObject def initself, image, height, speed     self.speed  speed     self.image, self.rect  loadimageshot.dsf, 1 Loads the image and creates rectange      self.pos  image.getrect.move0, height def moveself     self.pos  self.pos.moveself.speed, 0 Moves along     self.rect  [self.pos, 32, 32] Updates the position of the rectange.

create an admin area where admins can modifyenable user accounts, but cant touch other admins, so for that Ive decided to create a pageable query which would select only the users which dont have the codeROLEADMINcode role, since admins have both codeROLEUSERcode and codeROLEADMINcode roles.p  pAs can be seen from the above code, Ive modified the default generated code a bit and added a codejoinTablecode to the codeUsercode class instead of codehasMany [rolesUserRole]code or keeping it at the default without any references to roles. The reason for this change is because when querying UserRole Id occasionally get duplicates which would make pagination difficult. p  pSo with this current setup Ive managed to create two queries which allow me to fetch only users which do not have an admin role.p  precodedef rolesToIgnore  [ROLEADMIN] def userIdsWithGivenRoles  User.createCriteria.list      projections          property id          roles          in authority, rolesToIgnore        def usersWithoutGivenRoles  User.createCriteria.listmax 10, offset 0      not          in id, userIdsWithGivenRoles       codepre  pFirst query fetches a list of all the user ids which have the codeROLEADMINcode role, and then the second query fetches all the users whose id is not in the previous list.p  pThis works and is pageable, however It bothers me for two reasons p  ol licodejoinTablecode on User just seems icky to me. Why use a codejoinTablecode when i already have a specific class for that purpose codeUserRolecode, however that class is more difficult to query and Im afraid of possible overhead of mapping codeRolecode for each found codeUsercode even though I only need the codeUsercode.li liTwo queries, and only the second one can be paged.li ol  pSo my questions are  Is there a more optimal way to construct a query for fetching users which dont contain certain roles without restructuring the database into a pyramid role system where every user has only one role p  pAre two queries absolutely necessary Ive tried to construct a pure SQL query and I couldnt do it without subqueries. p

However, my composer.json does have a package name on the master and only branch. I have also used my repository with composer in other projects where I explicitly mention my repository. I would assume packagist is just using composer on the backend.

Negative 116 pFor me, it seems like the default interpreter for the axes labels are set to codenonecode, which in my case is undesirable, since I almost always need math symbols. Is there a way to change this Ive had no problem changing emTickInterpreterem or emTextInterpreterem by setting for example codesetgroot, defaultAxesTickInterpreter, texcode.p  pThe problem seems to be that for the axes labels, according to the documentation page for axes propertiesbr codeNote   To access the axis label text objects, use the XLabel, YLabel, and ZLabel properties or the xlabel, ylabel, and zlabel functions. These text objects are not contained in the axes Children property, they cannot be returned by findobj, and they do not use default values defined for text objects.codep  pThis makes one unable to access the labels from groot and therefore one cannot set a default value from there. Is there any workaround I dont want to set it manually every time.p

Negative 116 pI have a list of task where some are expect to be rejected and while others are resolved.p  pThe tasks dont have to be done in any particular order. However, it should not go into the catch clause unless all are rejected. Alternatively, I would like it to never go into catch clause but I inspect the status of each returning task myself to check if it was resolved or rejected.p  pAlso I might need all resolved tasks to walk further down the promise chains, and walking into the next one if it is successful.p  pIt seems like with codeallcode, a single rejected task can throw it into the catch clause. I dont want codeanycode either, since I expect all to be done.p  pHow would I be able to do thatp

Negative 116 pIm new to WPF following an attempt to move from winforms so this is basic question however im trying to add to a string from a button click. The scenario is basically a keypad full of buttons 0  9 and the user presses these as to enter a code as a type of PIN. The method of going about this is nonnegotiable so i cannot just replace with a text box and have the user type this. I have a little knowledge on bindings however it appears to be the appending to a string which is throwing me out as, obviously, all the buttons 09 need to be able to append to this string in sequence. So anyway, i have a ViewModel with a property called EnteredCode and the buttons reside in a grid named buttonsGrid. Would i be correct in thinking i handle the ButtonBase.Click event at the Grid level, determine which one was clicked and then append to the string The appending to the string is obviously the problem here which i need help with but just as general feedback to best practise p  pCode examples would also be a huge help.p  pTIAp
