This means that an       encoder can encode a floatingpoint value of 0.0 as the integer 0.       It, however, also means that an application that expects to find       integer values only might find floatingpoint values if the encoder       decides these are desirable, such as when the floatingpoint value is       more compact than a 64bit integer.p blockquote
Positive 305 pIn single point precision there is a significand of 23 bits giving an integer range if we where only storing a discreet integer value up to 224. The exponent is 8 bits giving a range up to 2127. At large magnitude numbers there is a point where they start to lose significant digits from the significandmantissa.p  pThis means a number like 232  28br 4,294,967,552br 0x100000100br 0b100000000000000000000000100000000br would be stored simply asbr exponent 0b00100000br significand  mantissa 0b00000000000000000000000 1 impled bitbr and lose 256 from its precision.p  pThis seems to be the opposite of so called subnormal numbers. Essentially the range of numbers being stored as an integer in the significand is much smaller than the range of numbers capable of being stored when taking into account the exponent. So once you get to 224 you start to lose information possible I have misundestanding of standard This seems to be the opposite of what happens at the subnormal range when information is lost when there is a significand but with a smaller exponent than 2127p  pHave I missed something in my understanding of the IEEE754 standardbr If not what is this scenario called when large magnitude numbers lose precision which seems to be the opposite of subnormal, perhaps supernormalbr And to maintain precision should I limit all floating point numbers to 107 lt x lt 107   p  pEDIT  Updated the numbers from 100,000,010, I also added more language to explain my understanding.p  pEDIT 2 Weather Vane and is correct. The point of floating point precision is that it loses accuracy on a fractional scale as soon as we start increasing magnitude, this starts affecting the integer scale when the magnitude increases the radix point past the end of the significandbr 0.0000000000000000000001  10000000000000000000000.0  I can see why the exponent is so much larger than the significand for representing ultra small numbers to the largest precision possible, but for large magnitude numbers there seems to be a whole class of numbers that lose information at a greater than fractional scale once we go beyond 23 sig fig in binay. I want to know what these are called, if they even have a name e.g. super normalp

Positive 305 pThe C standard library provides the coderoundcode, codelroundcode, and codellroundcode family of functions in C99. However, these functions are not IEEE754 compliant, because they do not implement the bankers rounding of halftoeven as mandated by IEEE. Halftoeven rounding requires the result to be rounded to the nearest even value if the fractional component is exactly 0.5. The C99 standard instead mandates halfawayfromzero as noted on a hrefhttpen.cppreference.comwcnumericmathround relnofollowcppreference.comap  blockquote   p13 Computes the nearest integer value to arg in floatingpoint format, rounding halfway cases away from zero, regardless of the current rounding mode.p blockquote  pThe usual adhoc way to implement rounding in C is the expression codeintx  0.5fcode which, despite being a hrefhttpblog.framac.comindex.phppost20130502nearbyintf1 relnofollowincorrecta in strict IEEE754 math, is usually translated by compilers into the correct codecvtss2sicode instruction. However, this is certainly not a portable assumption.p  pHow can I implement a function that will round any floating point value with halftoeven semantics If possible, the function should only rely upon language and standard library semantic, so that it can operate on nonIEEE floating point types. If this is not possible, an answer defined in terms of IEEE754 bit representations is also acceptable. Please characterize any constants in terms of codeltlimits.hgtcode or codeltlimitsgtcode.p

Positive 305 pI am using the softfloat library a hrefhttpwww.jhauser.usarithmeticSoftFloat.html relnofollowhttpwww.jhauser.usarithmeticSoftFloat.htmla to implement a single precision sqrt algorithm. I am trying to understand the reciprocal sqrt approximation function implemented as part of the softfloat library. Please see below the code. Could anyone explain how they came up with the LUT It looks like a combination of LUT and NR approximations, but a detailed explanation would definitely helpp  precode         Returns an approximation to the reciprocal of the square root of       the number represented by a, where a is interpreted as an         unsigned fixedpoint number either with one integer bit and 31       fraction bits or with two integer bits and 30 fraction bits.  The      format of a is determined by oddExpA, which must be either 0 or      1.  If oddExpA is 1, a is interpreted as having one integer bit,      and if oddExpA is 0, a is interpreted as having two integer      bits.  The a input must be normalized, meaning that its      mostsignificant bit bit 31 must be 1.  Thus, if A is the value of      the fixedpoint interpretation of a, it follows that 1 lt A lt 2      when oddExpA is 1, and 2 lt A lt 4 when oddExpA is 0.      The returned value is interpreted as a pure unsigned fraction, having     no integer bits and 32 fraction bits.  The approximation returned is      never greater than the true reciprocal 1sqrtA, and it differs      from the true reciprocal by at most 2.06 ulp units in the last      place.  The approximation returned is also always within the range      0.5 to 1 thus, the mostsignificant bit of the result is always set.            uint32t softfloatapproxRecipSqrt321 unsigned int oddExpA,   uint32t a               int index         uint16t eps         static const uint16t k0s[]             0xB4C9, 0xFFAB, 0xAA7D, 0xF11C, 0xA1C5, 0xE4C7, 0x9A43, 0xDA29,           0x93B5, 0xD0E5, 0x8DED, 0xC8B7, 0x88C6, 0xC16D, 0x8424, 0xBAE1                  static const uint16t k1s[]             0xA5A5, 0xEA42, 0x8C21, 0xC62D, 0x788F, 0xAA7F, 0x6928, 0x94B6,           0x5CC7, 0x8335, 0x52A6, 0x74E2, 0x4A3E, 0x68FE, 0x432B, 0x5EFD                  uint16t r0         uintfast32t ESqrR0         uint32t delta0         uintfast32t r         uint32t sqrDelta0          index  agtgt27 amp 0xE  oddExpA         eps  uint16t agtgt12         r0  k0s[index]  k1s[index]  uintfast32t epsgtgt20         ESqrR0  uintfast32t r0  r0         if   oddExpA  ESqrR0 ltlt 1         delta0  uintfast32t uint32t ESqrR0  uintfast64t  agtgt23         r  uintfast32t r0ltlt16  r0  uintfast64t delta0gtgt25         sqrDelta0  uintfast64t delta0  delta0gtgt32         r  uint32t rgtgt1  rgtgt3  uintfast32t r0ltlt14            uintfast64t sqrDelta0          gtgt48         if   r amp 0x80000000  r  0x80000000         return r         codepre

Now every time I create a new connection object and connect to my server, a new process is created and then put to sleep when I close my connection.  After a while the server will start refusing connections until I log in and kill all the processes my app created.  Obviously this isnt being done right, and I would like to learn the right way.p  pWould it be better to simply pass the same connection object by reference or inside a wrapper class among my forms, leaving the connection object open p  pWhat is the correct way to close my connection so that I dont eventually get a bunch of sleeping processes on my SQL server  Is there a setting in SQL server I can adjust to automatically kill processes after a certain period of inactivityp  pWould you consider encrypting the password in runtime memory overkillp  pThank you for any help. p

Negative 305 pThere have been similar questions but the answers werent what I was looking for. I want to insert the a value of NULL into the SQL Server database if the reference is NULL or a value has not yet been assigned. At the moment I am testing for null and it looks likep  precodeString testString  null  if testString  null      command.Parameters.AddParameternew SqlParametercolumn, DBNull.Value  else      command.Parameters.AddParameternew SqlParametercolumn, testString  codepre  pThis looks and feels incredibly clumsy to me. I have quite a few values that I am inserting into a database and to test them all like the above is very verbose. Does .Net not handle this in some way. I thought maybe if I used string as opposed to String but that also does not appear to work. Looking around I found articles which talk about using Nullable types.p  precodeSystem.NullableltTgt variable codepre  pThis seems to work for primitives, int, char double and bool. So that might work for those but what about strings Am I missing something here. What types should I be using for primitive values and for string values so that I do not have to repeatedly test values before inserting them.p  pEDIT Before I get too many answers about ternary operators. I like them but not in this context. It doesnt make sense for me to need to test that value and have all that extra logic, when that sort of thing could have been inplemented lower down in the .Net framework and if I knew what types to give then it would get it for free.p  pstrongEditstrong Okay, so guys help me formulate my plan of attack. I will use the Nullable for my primitives int, double etc and for my Strings I will use the String but the  test. This keeps things less verbose. Is there anything that I am missing here, like maybe losing some semanticsp

Negative 305 pIm modeling a forcebased physics simulation where several particles are interacting with each other.  The particles can move in such a way that a static viewport can easily lose track of them imagine the whole group of particles moving off the screen to the right and the viewport displaying a blank background.p  pMy current solution is to simply track the center of the particles by finding the minmax of the xs and ys and make the viewports middle follow that.  It works fine no need to find the true center of mass.  Heres a visualp  pimg srchttpi581.photobucket.comalbumsss259colithiumViewport.png altViewport p  pMy problem is Im attempting to add the ability to manually drag particles around with the mouse.  I havent found an elegant way to do this.  The problem is the translation between viewport coordinates and simulation coordinates is constantly changing because the viewport follows the particles center.p  pWhen I mouse down on a particle I want it to have a fixed location in the simulation it ignores all forces on it.  When I move the mouse with the button depressed I want the particle to move in the simulation.  I have achieved this.  However, it produces unpleasant sideeffects because of the viewport and the other particles that are still in motion.  The particle isnt moving in the simulation when the mouse is depressed and stationary but it is moving on screen because the center of all the particles changes and the viewport adjusts accordingly.  The cursor is stationary so the particle moves out from under it.  When the mouse is moved eversoslightly, the particle teleports back under the cursor because the cursors new position represents radically different simulation coordinates.p  pstrongAny suggestions for a nice, coherent user experience without the above side effectsstrongp  phr p  pIve already thought ofp  ul liPausing the simulation while the mouse is downli liSuspending viewport changes while the mouse is downli liMoving the mouse cursor as the viewport changes really badli ul  pBut they all have other bad sideeffects or take away value from the simulation.p  pAlso, I think this question is language and platform agnostic so dont attach literal and implementationspecific meanings to viewport, viewport coordinates, or simulation coordinates.  Treat them as generic graphics concepts.p

Negative 305 pI hope this makes sense.p  pI have created several WPF User Controls.  The lowest level item is PostItNote.xaml.  Next, I have a NotesGroup.xaml file that has an ItemsControl bound to a List of PostItNotes.  Above that, I have a ProgrammerControl.xaml file.

Negative 305 pI know that in C03, technically the codestdbasicstringcode template is not required to have contiguous memory.

Put another way, how may compilers actually take advantage of the freedom having noncontiguous memory allowsp  hr  pEDIT I updated this question to mention C03. Readers should note that when targeting C11, the standard now requires that codebasicstringcode be contiguous, so the above question is a non issue when targeting that standard.p

There are several graders written in MATLAB, so I want to tie them all together and let students run a program to do an assignment, and have them choose the assignment.  I am using a C main program, which then has mcccompiled MATLAB libraries linked to it.p  pSpecifically, my program reads a config file for the names of the various matlab programs, and other information.  It then uses that information to present choices to the student.  So, If an assignment changes, is added or removed, then all you have to do is change the config file.p  pThe idea is that next, the program invokes the correct matlab library that has been compiled with mcc.  But, that means that the libraries have to be recompiled if a grader gets changed.  Worse, the whole program must be recompiled if a grader is added or removed.  So, I would like one, simple, unchanging matlab library function to call the grader mfiles directly.  I currently have such a library, that uses eval on a string passed to it from the main program.p  pThe problem is that when I do this, apparently, mcc absorbs the grader mcode into itself changing the grader m code after compilation has no effect.  I would like for this not to happen.  It was brought to my attention that Mathworks may not want me to be able to do this, since it could bypass matlab entirely.  That is not my intention, and I would be happy with a solution that requires a full matlab install.p  pMy possible solutions are to use a mex file for the main program, or have the main program call a mcc library, which then calls a mex file, which then calls the proper grader.  The reason I am hesitant about the first solution is that Im not sure how many changes I would have to make to my code to make it work my code is C, not C, which I think makes things more complicated.  The 2nd solution, though, may just be more complicated and ultimately have the same problem.p  pSo, any thoughts on this situation  How should I do thisp
Negative 305 pI have a pagescoped component, which has an instance variable List with data, which I display in a datatable. This datatable has pagination, sorting and filtering.p  pThe first time gate into the page, I get this appended in my URL strongconversationId97strong. The page works correctly, and when I change datatable pages no now component is created.p  pAfter a minute or two, and at seamingly random time, I get an exception saying that there is no context. I have not used Create in my code or my navigation files.p  pSo, I have two questionsp  ul liWhy do I get this suffix in my URL Why did a conversation startli liWhy the exception The component is scoped to PAGE. If I received an exception, it should not be related to a conversation. Right Or is the conversation the exception is referring a temporary conversationli ul  pCheersp  pstrongUPDATE Istrongp  pThe project is an Ear.p  pThis is the pagep  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC

Negative 305 pIm trying to prevent a flicker effect that is occurring on my ASP.NET page which occurs when a user navigates to the page via the browser back button after having navigated away from it.

As a result, when the page is loaded via a back button that initial content is shown very briefly before it is updated with the correct Historyaware data.p  pIn order to overcome this I am intending on having the updatepanel hidden display none on inital page load and then show it as long as we dont have any history to deal with.

Negative 305 pWe are creating a business application Silverlight 4 at our company where we, in several of our views, use the functionality to synchronize two lists of some kind.p  pMore precise we are, at the moment, using two list boxes one source and one target and two buttons one add and one remove. Both the source list and the target lists are bound to collections with the same data type.p  pA user may select one or more items in the source list and press the add button to have the items moved to the target list i.e. the items are removed from the source and added to the target.p  pLikewise the user could select one or more items in the target list and press remove to have the items moved from the target back to the source list.p  pThere is also the possibility to add a validation rule that says that the user must add at least one item to the target list.p  pPretty simple... p  pUntil now we are using our own created user control which incapsulates these 4 controls 2 list boxes and 2 buttons and the logic for keeping the lists in sync. Dependency properties are used for binding the source and target collections.p  pNow to the problem. Our customer now wants our user control to be more flexible. They want to be able to have an arbitray number of columns in both the source and target list i.e. the source list may have different columns and a different number of columns than the target list. The customer also wants to be able to sort on any column.p  pMy first thought was to replace the list box to the data grid instead. But then I realized I dont know how to, in an easy way, let the consumer the developer define his or her columns and bindings. This may be to my limited knowledge of SL. Maybe a custom user control isnt the way to gop  pI would appreciate any kind of help. Right now we are implementing the same logic over and over again in our views and it doesnt feel right. There has to be some way we can make this a reusable component that is easy to use.p  pThanksp

Negative 305 pIm building a Reddit client, for the iPad and the iPhone. I know theres some other clients, but I have some really cool ideas for tabbed Reddit browsing Dp  pAnywho, Im working on the backend of the thing first, and was wondering what the best way to deal with my cookie would be. Im using ASIFormDataRequest and ASIHTTPRequest to get the cookie and make the requests for stories, and user subreddits. My question is, how do I know when the cookie has expired and Im not logged in anymorep  pA stupid solution In my opinion would be to just log in again before making any sort of data request... but that seems, well, stupid.p  pAnother solution would be to check specifically for different responses for different requests to Reddit and derive my loggedin status.p  pAn even BETTER way, would be to somehow see if I have a cookie in the iPhones cookie store that is associated with Reddit, and if I dont, log in. So, is there a way to do thatp

My codeobjcode class is of type codeDialogcode, which inherits codePopupcode.

The user would enter something like 10052011. There may also be MySQL queries on weeks, months, etc. Example, I need a query to find all the records from previous years.p  pSo what would be the best way to store these in MySQL and what should the field type be, and what would be the best way to extract these into a human readable form.p  pI know this is a loaded question, but just reading documents about all these different date functions has just confused me more, so any help is appreciated.p  pThanks, CRp

Negative 305 pAs a mostly frontend developer, this is in the realm of computer science that I dont often delve into, but heres my scenariop  pIve got an input of a string, split on spaces, say codepinto beanscodep  pIve got a array of results to search, that contains results like code[beans, mung,beans, pinto,beans, yellow,beans, fava]codep  pwhat might be the quickest way preferably in javascript or php to find the most relevant results, aka most matches, for instance, in the above case, I would like to sort the return array so that codebeans, pintocode is put at the top, and the rest come below, and any other results would go below those.p  pMy first attempt at this would be to do something like matching each result item against each input item, and incrementing matches on each one, then sorting by most matches to least.p  pThis approach would require me to iterate through the entire result array a ton of times though, and I feel that my lack of CS knowledge is leaving me without the best solution here.p  p EDIT Heres how I ended up dealing with the problem p  pBased on crazedfreds suggestion and the blog post he mentioned which was VERY helpful, I wrote some php that basically uses a combination of the trie method and the boyermoore method, except searching from the beginning of the string as I dont want to match bean in superbean.p  pI chose php for the ranking based on the fact that Im using js libraries, and getting real benchmarks while using convenience functions and library overhead wouldnt produce the testable results Im after, and I cant guarantee that it wont explode in one browser or another.p  pHeres the test datap  pSearch String codelima beanscodep  pResult array from db code[Beans, kidney,Beans, lima,Beans, navy,Beans, pinto,Beans, shellie,Beans, snap,Beans, mung,Beans, fava,Beans, adzuki,Beans, baked,Beans, black,Beans, black turtle soup,Beans, cranberry roman,Beans, french,Beans, great northern,Beans, pink,Beans, small white,Beans, yellow,Beans, white,Beans, chili,Beans, liquid from stewed kidney beans,Stew, pinto bean and hominy]codep  pFirst, I drop both the search string and the result array into php variables, after codeexplodecodeing the string on spaces.p  pthen, I precompile my patterns to compare the results top  precodemax  maxarraymapstrlen,input reg  array form0mltmaxm     reg[m]     foria0ialtcountinputia         reg[m].input[ia][m]       codepre  pthis gives me something like  code[lb,ie,ma,an,s]codep  pthen, I basically take each result string split on spaces, and match a case insensitive character class with the corresponding character number to it. If at any point during that comparison process I dont get any matches, I skip the word. This means if only 1 result starts with b or l, Ill only run one comparison per WORD, which is really fast. Basically Im taking the part of trie that compiles the searches together, and the constant speedup of the BoyerMoore stuff.p  pHeres the php  I tried codewhilecodes, but got SIGNIFICANTLY better results with codeforeachcodeesp  precodesort  array foreachresults as result     matches  0     resultStrs  explode ,result     foreachresultStrs as r         strlen  strlenr         forp0pltstrlenp             ifreg[p]                 pregmatch[.reg[p].]i,r[p],match             ifmatchtrue                 matches               else                  break 2                                sort[result]  matches  codepre  pThat outputs an array with the results on the keys, and how many character matches we got in total on the values.p  pThe reason I put it that way is to avoid key collisions that would ruin my data, and more importantly, so I can do a quick codeasortcode and get my results in order.p  pThat order is in reverse, and on the keys, so after the above code block, I runp  precodeasortsort sort  arrayreversearraykeyssort codepre  pThat gives me a properly indexed array of results, sorted most to least relevant. I can now just drop that in my autocomplete box.p  pBecause speed is the whole point of this experiment, heres my results  obviously, they depend partially on my computer.p  p2 input words, 40 results 5ms 2 input words, one single character, one whole 126 results 9msp  pObviously theres too many variables at stake for these results to mean much to YOU, but as an example, I think its pretty impressive.p  pIf anyone sees something wrong with the above example, or can think of a better way than that, Id love to hear about it. The only thing I can think of maybe causing problems right now, is if I were to search for the term codelean bimascode, I would get the same result score as codelima beanscode, because the pattern isnt conditional based on the previous matches. Because the results Im looking for and the input strings Im expecting shouldnt make this happen very often, Ive decided to leave it how it is for now, to avoid adding any overhead to this quick little script. However, if I end up feeling like my results are being skewed by it, Ill come back here and post about how I sorted that part.p

Negative 305 pInteresting and rather complex issue here...br What I have is a page with two iframes and a set of links at the top, each contained inside a div with an image background. What I want is for the contents of both iframes to change to two separate html documents when the link is clicked, and for the background image of the links parent div to also change. I also, however, want the parent div to automatically change back to the original class when a different link is clicked i.e. I have two classes, active and waiting. When a link is clicked and its contents subsequently displayed in the iframes I want it to switch to class active. At all other times, though, including after a different link might be clicked and become active I want it to go back to using the waiting class.p  pHeres my current code  markupp  pJavascriptbr codefunction changeFramelink br first iframe.srclink.hrefbr second iframe.srccode Here would be the second link, not sure how to define that codelink.ParentNode.addclassactivebutton codep  pHTMLbr codeltdiv classwaitingbuttongtbr lta hrefyes.htmlcode Somewhere here would be the second link for the second iframe codeclasswaitingbutton onclickchangeFramethisbr return falsegtButton Textltagtbr ltdivgtcodebr After this come four more divs, each identical bar Button Text and linksp  pAs I suspect you can tell, Im really just guessing here.

Negative 305 pIs the only proper way to achieve this by using a proxy Im working on a clicktail clone web user interaction amp mouse tracking analytics and what I have so far is a script that will track all the user interactions and will post them to my server and save to the database, but the issue is if this script is added to a client who will be on another domain, the Ajax post will fail due to the cross domain scripting restrictions. p  pfrom reading about this, there are some hacks, but im keen to avoid them. It seems that a proxy is the only way round this. But that in turn poses a larger issue for me as any client who wishes to use my clicktail clone will also have to setup a proxy in addition to added javascript on their. This will be straight forward for a webmaster with a PHP site, as I can provide the script and they just bang it on their server, but for .net sites, they would have to include that in their solution and recompile, maybe i could provide a dll, but even that would have to be referenced.p  pI have been reading about this codeHTML 5 window.postMessagecode  and this jquery plugin a hrefhttpbenalman.comprojectsjquerypostmessageplugin relnofollowhttpbenalman.comprojectsjquerypostmessageplugina this looks good, and I think ill be able to use it to playback the captured user interactions, using Iframes but It doesnt, at least I cannot see how resolve the issue with cross domain AJAX posting. if you were in my situation, could you post your possible solution p
Negative 305 pHi all, I have a problem that I believe will end up a minor syntax problem.  I hope.  I am pulling data from a camera into an app using WIA 2.0 on a windows 7 machine using c. The problem involves the timestamp. I dont want to transfer the image until I check if its timestamp is within a range. Here is the chopped down important part of the code. The sample here is from my test harness where I just do everything in one fell swoop, not from the real code. Again, I can make everything work fine if I ignore time, but that isnt an option.p  precodeWIA.DeviceManager devMgr  new WIA.DeviceManager   foreach DeviceInfo info in devMgr.DeviceInfos          if info.Type  WiaDeviceType.CameraDeviceType grab the first camera                cameraDevice  info.Connect         break             codepre  pHere there is a loop of i items in the camera each item is a pic at this point   p  precodeWIA.Item item  cameraDevice.Items[i]     timestamp  item.Properties.getItemItem Time Stamp.getValue.ToString   codepre  pNow on that last line it just returns codeSystem.ComObjectcode. I have no idea how to get the value out of this object, I cant casttransmutate it to anything useful, it has no properties I can find.  Can anyone help me with getting the value out of this timestamp objectp  pOn a side note, its amazing how few samples there are in the world of people using c and WIA. Just sayin.p

Negative 305 pMy question concerns Cassandra 0.8 and Pelops. I found that Pelops uses the same Thrift command for reading a slice of columns as for a slice of counter columns. Then, it iterates over the retrieved collection of a Thrift ColumnOrSuperColumn objects, asserting that column or countercolumn field is not null.

Negative 305 pstrongBackgroundstrong I have a tree of nodes and Im trying to run some machine learning algorithms to classify them.

I read about algorithms to find shortest distance between 2 nodes finding each ones distance to their closest common ancestor One idea I found was to have a vector x where each index corresponds to possible ancestors in the tree.

Negative 305 pThe story goes like this... p  pMy team has a git repo on a windows fileserver. A windows guy sets the repo up and begins committing. I, a mac guy, clone to my filesystem, makes some commits, then push back actually i go to the repo and pull my changes in. The problem is now I own permissions to the files in the repo, and even though I have readwrite permissions for everyone in the folder I cloned the repo into, the repo somehow takes on additional permissions restrictions on the windows os and my coworkers cannot commit.p  pThe scenario can play out the other way too. I set up the repo and a windows guy screws up the permissions.p  pSo how are you guys ensuring that permissions are consistent between different development environmentsp

On Apples dev site the link to download xcode 3 is only bundled with the latest, 4.3, iOS SDK. I do not have a real device with 3.0 either.

Negative 305 pHi so Im pretty new to MVC3 and Razor and Ive been trying to get my head around it the past few days. Ive been given a task by my project architect to create a helper method that sorts a drop down list in an MVC View. I have a View that retrieves various data from a Controller and Im returning some values that I want to appear in a drop down list. Ive been told not to sort it in the Controller and also to pass the field that we want to sort by into the helper method. I could do it like below but the architect wants to keep the view free of c sharp codep  precodeHtml.DropDownListFormodel gt model.StudyName, new SelectListViewBag.StudyTypes, Value, Text.OrderByl gt l.Text codepre  pSo Ive created some sample code and some extension methods to try and get it to work.

Negative 305 pIm looking for a Ruby ORM to replace ActiveRecord. Ive been looking at Sequel and DataMapper.

Negative 305 pI just finished my first successful CoreData store and fetch which worked fine in the simulator, but wouldnt run on my device I got dozens of errors. Most of the errors were link errors and I was able to fix them by deleting all the links to the CoreData framework and then relinking it in the build phases tab. This solved most of the errors when building for my device, but introduced 2 errors when building for the simulator. The errors are all the same thing CoreDataCoreData.h file not found although I checked the file directory and it seems to be fine. I also have another app from a tutorial that uses CoreData and it runs fine and has the same file directory. Specifically, the errors are in my NSManagedObject classes, fresh out of the .xcdatamodel and obviously occur on the line where I import . p

Negative 305 pFor an upcoming project, I am looking into MVP as an option over MVC.  I am highly familiar with and like MVC, and am merely trying to see if I will gain anything using MVP.p  pWhat I gather about MVP is that it uses the ASP.Net view engineMVC which I dont particularly like that uses the ViewState  adding a bunch of extra content to a rendered web page, and not built in routing functionality can be written in separately into the Global.asax.p  pMVCRazor on the other hand, renders very clean HTML.p  pCertain articles, such as a hrefhttpwww.codeguru.comcsharp.netnetgeneralpatternsarticle.phpc15173 relnofollowthis onea seem to lean towards using MVP for multiple views, however in light of MVC3 with jQuery Mobile, there are some fantastic things that can be accomplished with this MVC.p  pHow do these compare to what is currently available with MVP  What are some proscons or potential pitfalls of using MVP over MVCp  pI am also considering using an existing MVP application to expedite development time.  p  pstrongI know you will cringe at the following, but looking for optionsstrong While this app offers all the required features, if implementing this solution, how difficult is it to tie in additional MVC applications I know that looks ugly  If this was something that we had to consider combining both, would it be best to wrap the application in MVC routing and have the MVP app contained insidep  pThe reason for this is a staggered feature update process, where the requirement is to implement a new feature which is built using the MVC framework the rest of the system is not.  Future plans are to completely change the current framework to either MVC or MVP.p  pThanks.p

The only difference is, that the struct containing the pointer to be freed is declared and defined normally in the working program and declared as codeexternalcode and defined in another file than main.c Calling free manually in main.c works, while calling csvfree crashes.

Negative 305 pI am developing codes for the scientific computing community particularly for solving linear system of equations Axb form iteratively. p  pI have used BLAS and LAPACK for primitive matrix subroutines but I now realize that there is some scope for manual parallelization.

Negative 305 pWhile the recommended tutorials online Ray Wenderlich, Troy Brant and Mugunth Kumar provide some information, most are out of date methods have since been deprecated, some provide generic Xcode guidance e.g. using Interface Builder, Root View Controllers, etc. and others provide way too many addon features that only confuse the person trying to implement inapppurchases or are trying to sell you their kit...p  pIn my case Im simply trying to use inapppurchases to unlock levels in a game I created using Cocos2d and Box2d.  I just need to display 2 items More Levels, Skip Level with the Pay to Unlock Now Hence, I dont need a UITableView to display them or a long plist of inapps.  Once a  purchase has been made the app needs to know so I can easily unlock the levels...p  pThe various tutorials above were good for letting me know that I had top  ol liFirst create the app in apple.comdevelopersli liThen add it to iTunesli liThen create my inapp purchase items li ol  pThe above was all very confusing mostly because of the iTunes involvement  seems like a lot of unnecessary duplication of accountsloginsinputetc.  Now I am convinced that iTunes is a vestigial company idea that has yet to bite the dust.  But okay, if you want inapppurchases you have to work with iTunes...p  pMy problem is trying to adopt what has been stated in the tutorial codes you know...retrieveProducts, buyProducts, etc. for the Cocos2dBox2d environment which does not use a View Controller and simply uses an App Delegate at its top level...p  pIm looking for a good, solid answer with detailed steps and sample code if necessary, not a quick fix like You need to blah blah check your plist settings and make sure it matches iTunes obviously, blah blah read this already have, blah blah and youre done.  Ive already been there and that hasnt worked which is why Im asking the question again here p  pHow do I implement In App Purchases when using Cocos2d and Box2dp  pAssume that I have already done the necessary developeriTunes configuration, have StoreKit and SystemConfiguration added to the project, have my distribution certificate in place, etc.p  pStart off by sayingp  ol liIn your project, create a new Cocos2dBox2d file called MyStoreKit.mm li ol

Negative 305 pWe are building an app that is deployed on a range of Customer iPads via AdHoc. Testflight works great with that, however our latest release refuses to install on iPads that have the latest version of iOS 5.1 installed  we previously deployed successfully to these iPads and their UDIDs are definitely in the mobile provisioning profile. Also the same build installs fine on an iPad that has an older version of iOS.p  pI already suggested to reregister the device as per the TestFlight FAQ article, but that didnt help. It seems to be a problem with iOS 5.1  the user is asked to Contact the Developer as the device does not have permissions.p  pHas something changed with iOS 5.1 re the requirements for AdHoc deployment We are building using the distribution profile, signing with the distribution certificate  and as I said, the app installs fine on iPads runnin older versions of iOS.p

This way we could deliver the framework as a standalone framework without having any restrictions on the version of boost that needs to be used in an application that is using our framework.p  pAs such, I set up the test app to use boost 148 and the framework to use 149.

This equals the followingp  precode[[[[myDict objectForKeyA] objectForKeyA] objectForKeyB] setValuemyValue forKeymyKey] codepre  pDoes anyone know of a way where I can achieve this I imagine that I should keep a reference to the dictionary, iterate over the objects in the array and go to the next level in the dictionary and keep a reference to this and when the last object in the array has been reached, set the value for the key. My problem is, that I cant figure out how to pull this off. To hold a reference to the dictionary, when I go to the next level, I need initialize a new dictionary, right This causes me to create a new dictionary only containing the objects for the current level and thereby I will not end up setting a value for a key in the original dictionary.p  pAny code examples or pseudo codes would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 305 pI had some problems with vertical spacing in Firefox and IE for an embarrassingly long time.p  pI am using a codecode selector in my css to apply margins to everything within a certain container element. Works fine in Chrome, however in FF and IE I was getting mysterious extra padding seemingly coming from nowhere, as you can observe here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netXrVXF3 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netXrVXF3a.p  pIt turns out I had two separate problems. One is that nonChrome browsers will select  elements with the codecode selector and apply the margins and emthe margins show up in the browserem even though the element is invisible to things like Firebug. strongShould this be considered a bugstrong You may be asking what business is a link element doing inside the body tag. Well I could probably avoid it but it is the easiest way to do some things on my site. a hrefhttpwww.tutorialchip.comtutorialshtml5blocklevelelementscompletelist relnofollowThis pagea says that the codecode selector should only apply to block level elements in HTML5, which I am using, so in that sense it seems to me that Firefox at least is bugging out, and IE too if they are supposed to have proper HTML5 support yet. Now that I know this I can work around it but strongmaybe there are other elements I should worry about toostrong Doesnt seem to apply to script or style tags. strongWould I be better off applying margins to a large list of html elements instead of codecodestrongp  pThe other weird thing, which you can observe in the fiddle I linked is that the clearfix on the bottom which is not necessary in the example, but is on my site also picks up the margins and applies them in FF and IE but not in Chrome. strongWhich is the right behaviourstrong Strangely, I noticed that turning off overflowhidden, prevents the clearfix from taking up space, and doesnt seem to have any detrimental effect on my site. strongWhat is overflow set to hidden forstrongp  pstrongCorrectionstrong Oops, I was using .clear when I meant to be using .clearfix which appends content after your floated stuff, which seems to work fine and doesnt have margin issues.p

Negative 305 pmydomain.com is running with nginx1.2, phpfpm, apc on an Ubuntu server medium  amazon EC2. I have been tweaking my server for past 6 months, however a problem started occurring since the day before yesterday.p  pI am unable to resolve the root for www.mydomain.com, or mydomain.com. It takes 3 minutes to receive a broken page with all the links on the page converted to the local IP 10.x.x.x. However, any other URL, www.mydomain.coma, or mydomain.coma, or www.mydomain.coma.php etc. resolve perfectly and with the characteristic nginx speed I am a big fan. Even www.mydomain.comindex.php resolves perfectly that is basically the same server root i.e www.mydomain.com. So, it seems that requests can not be resolved only if passed without any URL at the end.p  pI came up with the following three possibilities why this could be happening p  ol liIncorrect host setup I might be passing incorrect host information in some setting i.e in phpfpm.conf, php.ini, or nginx.conf or in ubuntu under hosts, or hostname.conf etc. li liIncorrect index setup I might be passing incorrect index types in nginx.conf or phpfpm.conf li lianything is possible li ol  pMost importantly, this problem goes away, if I stop using the servername directive in nginx.conf. So, an unnamed nginx server block leads to normal operation, but the moment I put in the servername directive to www.mydomain.com or mydomain.com, then again the domain root becomes unreachable.p  pThis has been driving me crazy for the past two days. Ceaseless googling has been of little help, as it is probably a configuration misdirective. I humbly bend down, before my computer overlords Please helpp

Negative 305 pPreviously I had Jenkins launching a perl build script that at some point during the script would open up a .bat file that launched our ANT jobs. Im trying to consolidate and get rid of the .bat files and launch ANT straight from the perl script.

The script.dir is being defined in a .properties file that is located in the same directory as the build files. This works perfectly when its launched by the .bat file, but it fails whenever its called through Perl.

Negative 305 pPep 8 has the following rulesp  blockquote   pBlank Linesp      pSeparate toplevel function and class definitions with two blank   lines.p      pMethod definitions inside a class are separated by a single blank   line.p      pExtra blank lines may be used sparingly to separate groups of   related functions. Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of   related oneliners e.g. a set of dummy implementations.p      pUse blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical sections.p      pPython accepts the controlL i.e. L form feed character as   whitespace Many tools treat these characters as page separators, so   you may use them to separate pages of related sections of your file.

Is there another character that should go in that space My assumption is just leave the spacestabs on the blank line because it is more readable.p  pIn the second example nested defs need to have their previous lines indention maintained for the parse to work correctly.

Negative 305 pOn my Linux server, I need to synchronize multiple scripts, written in BASH and PHP, so that only one of them is able to start a systemcritical job, which is a series of BASHPHP commands, that would mess things up if performed simultaneously by two or more scripts. From my experience with multithreading in C, Im familiar with the notion of mutex, but how do I implement a mutex for a bunch of scripts that run in separate processes and, of course, arent written in Cp  pWell, the first solution that comes into mind would be making sure that each of the scripts initially creates a lock flag file to let other scripts know that the job is locked and then deletes the file after its done with the job. But, as I see it, the file writing emandem reading operations are required to be emcompletely atomicem to let this approach work out with a 100 probability, and the same requirement would apply to any other synchronization method. And Im pretty sure that file writingreading operations are not atomic, they are not atomic across all existing LinuxUnix systems at least.p  pSo what is the most flexible and reliable way to synchronize concurrent BASH emandem PHP scriptsp

Negative 305 pIm looking for an example of code that samples signal from microphone and plays it on speakers. I need a solution that has a resonably constant delay on different platforms PC, android, iphone. Delay around 12 s is ok for me, and I dont mind if it varies everytime the application starts.p  pI tried using SampleDataEvent.SAMPLEDATA event on Sound and Microphpne classess. One event would put data into buffer the other would read data. But it seems impossible to provide constant delay, either the delay grows constantly or it gets lower to the point where I have less than 2048 samples to put out and Sound class stops generating SampleDataEvent.SAMPLEDATA events.p  pI want to process each incoming frame so using setLoopBacktrue is not an option.p  pps This is more a problem on Android devices than on PC.

Negative 305 pSo I am trying to find the answer to this, but there seems to be no definitive one I can find to help me make the right choice.p  pSo What I am curious about is code.delegatecode as of recently I am a fan of using it, seems to be a bit more stable in most of my apps now a days. So with that. I typically when using it will do something likep  precodediv.delegate.someclass, click, functione ....  codepre  pand I am good with that, until now. Where I have an element that I need to handle multiple events for.

Or is there a function I simliar in nature to the combination of the two that I might not be aware of p

Negative 305 pHello Networking Gurus, p  pI have a question about IP duplication and how this impact the associated switches layer 2. Sorry, I dont have any resources available to test this. It would be great if someone can shed some lights of their experience on this.p  pIf I have two servers Linux, say codeAcode amp codeBcode, serving exactly same contents and for some reason they both are assigned same IP address. To be more specific, if A already has an address codeIP.100code and B has another address codeIP.200code. Now at this point everything seems working and the switch has proper MAC addresses stored. If, later, codeBcode also gets the address codeIP.100code, how would this affect the switchs codeARPcode cache When codeBcode gets the new address I assume it broadcasts ARP to inform the associated switch. p  pSo the question is, Does the switch stores both machines entries or overwrites the existing with new Is there any standard behaviour or proprietary switches reacts differently p  pIf a client, with no ARP cache, tries to connect to IP.100, which machine would it be forwarded to codeAcode or codeBcode or none If codeAcode OR codeBcode, can I say from client pointofview, that theres no outage Assume this is a static website, with no login sessions etc p  pFeel free to point any relevant documentation. p  pThank you in advance. p

For instancep  precode tr is an tr element of a table input[typecheckbox], tr.eachfunction      this.removeAttronclick.clickfunction          functhis       codepre  pThe Functionp  precodefunction funcchkbx      if chkbx.checked           do stuff...      else           do other stuff...       codepre  pNow the problem When the function is called by the origin trobject everything works fine, but when the function is called by the clonedcopied tr it always goes into the elsebranch.p  pI checked the passed object, certainly. Passed from the origin trobject its an HTMLInputElement as expected, but from the cloned one its a normal object. The strange thing is when i check both if theyve got the checked property, none of them have it...p  pI just want the function to work properly for the cloned object, too..p  pI hope that somebody can help and everybody does understand me D thanksp  hr  pupdate the problem was solved with thisp  precodechkbx.propchecked codepre  pinstead ofp  precodechkbx.checked codepre  pbut i wonder why the attr function did result in an undefinedp

Negative 305 pI ran into some strange errors and just ask myself if I have a fundamental issue in my class hierarchy. I am an absolute newbie if it comes to python. So if this approach appears llike total crap  you know why that is p  pI have a couple of classes in an application I designed around the MVC pattern. The applications controller has control over four objects I call devices, since they act like independant devices. Each device runs actions computations, image processing in this case. Those actions are meant to run inside separate threads. So each device should open an own thread and have its computation done in that thread. p  pFor this I designed a base class describing a device, so all devices inherit their basic setup and logic, especially the way they are controlled by the controller. For the threads I implemented a worker class, I plan to push that classes instances into the threads. That part is not working yet. Those worker classes are designed like this The base device class contains a nested worker base class. It also implements some basic control methods to handle a worker instance that is stored as a member of the base device class. All specialized device classes derived from the base device class also implement a nested worker class. Those classes are derived from the base worker class nested inside the base device class. Here is a sketch of the hierarchy p  precodeclass Device              methods              members              class Worker                           methods                           members class fooDeviceDevice                         methods                         members                         class fooWorkerDevice.Worker                                                        methods                                                        members class barDeviceDevice                         methods                         members                         class barWorkerDevice.Worker                                                        methods                                                        members codepre  pNote that the classes codefooWorkercode and codebarWorkercode are both derived from codeDevice.Workercodep  pMy question is  although the stuff appears to work during setup I get runtime errors. not sure yet where they come from, what they mean. But first I want to understand of that class hierarchy layout I made up does make sense at all Is it totally twisted nonsense Or in common use p  pThanksp

Negative 305 pIm fairly new to programming and im trying to make a little game where you can controlrotate a tank and different guns on top of the tank indepently. Im using slickp  pduring tank rotation the guns should rotate around the center of the tankimage because they are attached.p  precodepublic void drawTankandGuns   tankImage.drawposition.x, position.y   gunImage.drawposition.xcanonOffsetX, position.ycanonOffsetY   public void rotateDuringMovement   gunImage.setCenterOfRotationtankImage.getWidth2gunOffsetX,     tankImage.getHeight2gunOffsetY    gunImage.rotateangle   tankImage.rotateangle  codepre  pwhich works fine so far. gun is attached and rotates with tank. but if i want to rotate the gun without the tank and tank is rotated already and set the center of rotation back to the gun the gunimage is drawn back at its original position losing the position from the rotation around the tank...p  pedit the solution was to use a different approach. draw the gunImage dependend on sincos of the tankImage rotation.p
Negative 305 pWe have bought Team Viewer corporate, and need to deploy to our infrastructure, it includes Windows XP SP3, and Windows 7, our domain controller is Windows 2003 SP2, the setting of Team Viewer was exported to .reg file including the passwords and whitelists, I used the .vbs that Team Viewer provided to merge the registry values we exported earlier. At a testing environment that matches the real environment, the deployment itself runs perfectly using GPO, but the script doesnt run, if I tried to run the script manually by double clicking the .vbs file, I get open file security warning dialogue box, so I disabled it at the attachment manager by adding .vbs to the low risk list and everything worked fine, but the management refused this solution since it will endanger the network by marking all .vbs files as safe, and because it uses user configuration rather than using computer  configuration at GPO, why does this matter Because users are mobile throughout the regions where we operate, and when a user logs in using their credentials they will trigger the script and the deployment which will affect the network bandwidth. My question, is there any way to deploy Team Viewer and merge the registry file through .vbs using computer configuration at active directory GPOp

Negative 305 pA website Im working on now is meant to replicate a document that you could print. There is a header, a body, and a footer. All three elements use CSS to adjust the margins and height of each one.p  pThe footer is 0.5in high and must end at least 0.5in from the bottom of the page, but cannot exceed that. Based on other word processors, if the footer is larger than 0.5in, the footer moves up on the page so that it maintains that 0.5in border.p  pThis means that the body will shrink, so Ive set it up I think so that a larger footer will shrink the body which is the expected behavior.p  pHowever, what I want is a way for the footer to adjust its position on the page so that it is always at least 0.5in from the bottom of the page.p  pNote Id like the solution to work for any number of pages for one document, so I cant use fixed positions.p  pIm including my demo code which works as long as the height is small enough.p  precodeltdiv styleheight 9in paddingleft 1in paddingright 1in paddingtop 0.5in paddingbottom 0.5in backgroundcolor eee margintop 0.08in marginleft 0.08ingt             ltdiv styleheight 0.5ingt Nick 1 ltdivgt             ltdiv stylemaxheight 9in height 9ingtI love stuff.ltdivgt             ltdiv styleminheight 0.5in height 0.5in margintop 0.5ingtFooterltdivgt ltdivgt codepre

I have copied all the folder under my projects appassetsimages , appasetsjavascripts and appassetsstylesheets from the themes corresponding folder. Then, I got several error when I tried to run my app locally. I deleted my application.css file, after that it started working. But, I can not see any design of the theme. I can only see my app like it was before. No design is showing up into my app. So, what I am missing here  What should I do to make this theme work into my rails app Please help.p

Negative 305 pIm trying to create a single UIImage from multiple UIImages and a label.  I know how to create this in the view, and it looks fine.  The problem is that I want this single image printed by a professional printing company.  The minimum resolution the printing company accepts is 1838x1238.  The view resolution is obviously much smaller than this.  I want to create a high resolution UIImage from several camera images and include a label, but the high resolution copy wont be displayed bc I figure it will crash the app.  I cant do a screen shot or use UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext because of the resolution issue.  I am completely stumped, and help would be appreciated p

I am using the               UITextField delegate to get the value of the textfield when its finished editing and then adds it to a mutable array.

This all works perfectly fine. However my problem occurs if that text field is edited again, if the user changes the values in that text field it will then add another value into the array, i would like the previous value to be edited rather than creating a new value in the array.p  pAny help would be appreciated pleasep

Negative 305 pI have the following classesp  precodeclass Stream   class FileStream  public Stream   class NetworkStream  public Stream  codepre  pEach class has a codewritecode method virtual.p  pI can use a FileStream on two types of media HDD and SSD. If Im writing to an HDD, I dont do anything special over what codeFileStreamcode already provides. However, if Im writing so an SSD, there is some logic I need to execute prior to calling codewritecode. From within codeFileStreamcode, I have no idea what the media is Im writing to. Only the call site knows. Id like to use decorator here, but decorator is intended to be used with all streams. I only want to extend the functionality of codeNetworkStreamcode in certain situations. Is some form of decorator appropriate here If not, what design pattern should I use If we assume codeFileStreamwritecode simply flushes the entire internal buffer to the file and saves it to the disk, then the decorator will need to write some metadata to the stream prior to writing it.p  pI thought of creating a simple decorator class that doesnt use inheritance like sop  precodeclass FileStreamDecorator  public   FileStreamDecorator FileStreamamp stream   mstream stream       void write      mstream ltlt Some Metadata     mstream.write     private   FileStreamamp mstream  codepre  pAnd it would be used like sop  precodeFileStream stream stream ltlt Complete file data   At this point we know we are writing to SSD, so we must use the decorator FileStreamDecorator decorator stream  decorator.write codepre  pWould this be an appropriate solution Can anyone think of a better wayp

Negative 305 pIm using jquery isotope for a sortable text listing of federal regulatory activities. We list each update in a docket and the list per docket can become quite long.

Negative 305 pI was wondering about C11 best practices regarding parameter passing nullptr.  I want to reset a class member object by passing a nullptr to an already existing setter function.  For a simple examplep  precodeinclude foo.h  Foo myfoo  void setfoostdsharedptrltFoogt bar   myfoo  bar   int main    setfoostdmakesharedltFoogt   do stuff   setfoonullptr  codepre  pIs this okay  Or, or are there better, more preferred methods for resetting myfoo  I didnt want to make another method just for resetting myfoo.p  pThe real motivation in the application Im working on is that I have a persisting singleton class that is shared by a variable number of other classes.  Its convenient for coding purposes for those other classes to simply own a shared pointer to that singleton for the duration they require and use it, and then to discardset to nullptr when they are no longer allowed to have access to it.  If theres anything I may be missing or not thinking of, any advice is greatly appreciated, thanksp

Negative 305 pIn my scenario, the user sends a request to the server and then the server can upload a list of items to the database. The list of items is uploaded to the database in a for loop, consisting of several queries. It is very important that these items are added to the database in a sequential  order.p  pNow, the problem is that if the user issues another request, another set of for loops will be launched, and the items may not be added to the database in the correct order. Because there will be two for loops adding items to the database.p  pExample  Request 1 1,2,3           Request 2 4,5,6 Order in which they are inserted into the database Should be  1,2,3,4,5,6 However, potentially can be 1,4,2,5,6,3p  pIf a different user issues a request, there is no problem, because the two requests will then be mutually exclusive.p  pTo solve the problem, I could use a static method or use the synchronized keyword, but I do not want to cause a bottleneck in the codeother users should not have to wait to access the database.p  pOr, perhaps it is a bad idea to perform multiple queries using a for loopp  pHow can I synchronize my code around a request rather than an object or method Is there a design pattern or somethingp

Negative 305 pIm in the process of adding Actionbarsherlock to my app to update the UI for Android 2.22.3 users.  ABS is working great but I found an issue with older devices where the ListView would hang after the app was opened after a reboot.  The app lists all apps with Internet Permission and then adds a few special apps the app is a firewall and would hang while trying to display the information.p  pOriginally the code cached the apps after building the list using standard arrays.  I want to move the app away from the caching since i think thats a huge reason for some of the hanging.  So Ive been moving everything from arrays to ArrayLists for easier usage.  I ran into one IndexOutofBounds but corrected that one but this one is stumping me completely.  Here is my code for getting the apps and sorting code.  p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated and if any other code is needed please ask Thanks in advancep  pApp list codep  precodeint count  0     try          final PackageManager pkgmanager  ctx.getPackageManager         final ListltApplicationInfogt installed  pkgmanager                 .getInstalledApplicationsPackageManager.GETMETADATA         final HashMapltInteger, DroidAppgt map  new HashMapltInteger, DroidAppgt         final Editor edit  prefs.edit         boolean changed  false         String name  null         String cachekey  null         final String cacheLabel  cache.label.

In the Java app Im using logback to produce logs.p  pNow I need to log the C library messages as well and I have to do it in the same file used by Java so I can have everything in chronological order.p  pMy current approach, not yet implemented, is to create a C class named emLoggerem that will send the messages to Java through JNI and then Java will log these messages.

I have a chat serverconsole application and a chat client winform application reference  a hrefhttpcsharp.netinformations.comcommunicationscsharpchatserverprogramming.htm relnofollowhttpcsharp.netinformations.comcommunicationscsharpchatserverprogramming.htma and a separate winform application which only has a button on it. Whenever there is any new message and if the client window  is minimized then i want that the button on that separate winform turns red. Once the client window gets restored or maximized then it should turn back to yellow which is also the original color of the button. I am able to achieve the change of color when a message is received but not taking into consideration the minimized state etc. If i try to do that using IsIconic nothing happens. What i have done is that get a handle of the client winform in the server application and checking if it is Iconic or not. Please guide as i am stuck on this for a while.

Negative 305 pIm trying to convert a CodeKit project to use Grunt so we can support our Windows friends.p  pIn CodeKit, you can concatenate JS files by including concat instructions as comments in the files you want concatenated. For example, to prepend codejquery.validate.jscode to your codescripts.jscode file, you would add the following comment to codescripts.jscodep  precode  codekitprepend jquery.validate.js  codepre  pHow can I configure gruntconcat or a similar plugin to concatenate JS files based on instructions within the files themselves Id prefer to have concat instructions in the files so its more clear whats going on as opposed to referring to Gruntfile.js.p

Negative 305 pIn my strongMainActivitystrong, I have a Fragment called stronglistImagesFragmentstrong which uses GridView to layout my images in a grid.  Within that Fragment, I have an ItemClickListerner, so when one of the images is clicked, it starts another activity and displays that image.p  pWhat I would like to do is when an image is clicked, I would like it to open up a different version of the image clicked.  For arguments sake, lets say the GridView shows faces without the eyes, and when you press one of them, it shows a version of it with eyes.p  pThe way I planned to do this was to somehow get the resource name of the image displayed in the gridview, and then concatenate it with a string.  Pass this new name to my single image activity guesser.java which would load up the other image.br For example.  GridView image resource might be called icnoface1 and the resource of the other image would be icnoface1withface.  p  pHow would I go about getting the resource name of an image I have pressed My current code is belowp  hr  pstrongMainActivity.javastrong emlistImagesFragement extractemp  precodepublic class listImagesFragment extends Fragment       Override     public View onCreateView LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState          View view  inflater.inflateR.layout.gridview,container,false         GridView gridView  GridView view.findViewByIdR.id.gridview         gridView.setAdapternew RestaurantImageAdapterview.getContext          gridView.setOnItemClickListenernew AdapterView.OnItemClickListener              public void onItemClickAdapterViewltgt parent, View v, int position, long id                  Intent i  new IntentgetActivity, Guesser.class                  i.putExtraid, position                 startActivityi                               return view       codepre  pstrongGuesser.javastrong p  precodepublic class Guesser extends Activity      Override     public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState          Get the view from singleitemview.xml         setContentViewR.layout.guesser           Get position from intent passed from MainActivity.java         Intent i  getIntent          int position  i.getExtras.getIntid           Open the Image adapter         RestaurantImageAdapter imageAdapter  new RestaurantImageAdapterthis           Locate the ImageView in singleitemview.xml         ImageView imageView  ImageView findViewByIdR.id.imageView          Get image and position from ImageAdapter.java and set into ImageView         imageView.setImageResourceimageAdapter.mThumbIds[position]        codepre  pstrongRestaurantImageAdapter.javastrong emGenerates the gridviewemp  precodepublic class RestaurantImageAdapter extends BaseAdapter       private Context mContext      public RestaurantImageAdapterContext c          mContext  c           public int getCount          return mThumbIds.length           public Object getItemint position          return null           public long getItemIdint position          return 0            create a new ImageView for each item referenced by the Adapter     public View getViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent          ImageView imageView         if convertView  null    if its not recycled, initialize some attributes             imageView  new ImageViewmContext          else              imageView  ImageView convertView                   imageView.setImageResourcemThumbIds[position]         return imageView            references to our images     public Integer[] mThumbIds               R.drawable.rtgiblank, R.drawable.rkrispykremeblank,             R.drawable.rgreggsblank, R.drawable.rnandosblank,             R.drawable.rdennysblank, R.drawable.rihopblank,             R.drawable.rfbblank, R.drawable.rwagamamablank,             R.drawable.rsubwayblank, R.drawable.rbkblank,             R.drawable.rzizziblank, R.drawable.rtacoblank,             R.drawable.rstarbucksblank, R.drawable.rbennigansblank,             R.drawable.rapplebeesblank       codepre

Then I could highlight the needed series.p  pI have have found 2 options to sent the color using propertiesp  pstrong.Interior.Colorstrong p  ul liORli ul  pstrong.Format.Fill.ForeColor.SchemeColorstrongp  pBut there I used RGB color model to set a color.p  pHow can I come back to strongAutomaticstrong color, that is strongdefault colorstrong in my chart template. What value should I assign to the properties abovep  pThanksp

Negative 305 pSometimes, once I have requested the cancellation of a pending task with a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarydd32195528vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowcodeCancellationTokenSource.Cancelcodea, I need to make sure strongthe task has properly reached the cancelled statestrong, before I can continue. Most often I face this situation when the app is terminating and I want to cancel all pending task gracefully. However, it can also be a requirement of the UI workflow specification, when the new background process can only start if the current pending one has been fully cancelled or reached its end naturally.p  pstrongId appreciate if someone shares hisher approach in dealing with this situation.strong Im talking about the following patternp  precodecancellationTokenSource.Cancel task.Wait codepre  pAs is, it is known to be capable of easily causing a deadlock when used on the UI thread. However, it is not always possible to use an asynchronous wait instead i.e. codeawait taskcode e.g., a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq18999827herea is one of the cases when it emisem possible. At the same time, it is a code smell to simply request the cancellation and continue without actually observing its state. p  pAs a simple example illustrating the problem, I may want to make sure the following codeDoWorkAsynccode task has been fully cancelled inside codeFormClosingcode event handler. If I dont wait for the codetaskcode inside codeMainFormFormClosingcode, I may not even see the codeFinished work item Ncode trace for the current work item, as the app terminates in the middle of a pending subtask which is executed on a pool thread. If I do wait though, it results in a deadlockp  precodepublic partial class MainForm  Form      CancellationTokenSource cts     Task task       Form Load event     void MainFormLoadobject sender, EventArgs e              cts  new CancellationTokenSource         task  DoWorkAsynccts.Token            Form Closing event     void MainFormFormClosingobject sender, FormClosingEventArgs e              cts.Cancel         try                       if we dont wait here,              we may not see Finished work item N for the current item,              if we do wait, well have a deadlock             task.Wait                  catch Exception ex                      if ex is AggregateException                 ex  ex.InnerException             if ex is OperationCanceledException                 throw                  MessageBox.ShowTask cancelled            async work     async Task DoWorkAsyncCancellationToken ct              var i  0         while true                      ct.ThrowIfCancellationRequested              var item  i             await Task.Run gt                              Debug.PrintStarting work item   item                  use Sleep as a mock for some atomic operation which cannot be cancelled                 Thread.Sleep1000                  Debug.PrintFinished work item   item             , ct                codepre  pThat happens because the UI threads message loop has to continue pumping messages, so the asynchronous continuation inside codeDoWorkAsynccode which is scheduled on the threads codeWindowsFormsSynchronizationContextcode has a chance to be executed and eventually have reached the cancelled state. However, the pump is blocked with codetask.Waitcode, which leads to the deadlock. This example is specific to WinForms, but the problem is relevant in the context of WPF, too.p  pstrongIn this case, I dont see any other solutions but to organize a nested message loop, while waiting for the codetaskcode.strong In a distant way, it is similar to a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.threading.thread.join28vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowcodeThread.Joincodea, which keeps pumping messages while waiting for a thread to terminate.

Negative 305 pI have one wordpress website that has very sporadical db connection error Error Establishing a database connectionbr What should I do to determine the root of problem, solve it and try to prevent it in futurep  pstrongBrief storystrongbr There is no pattern or something that could help me understand the nature of this problem. Site many times was sporadically down for 3040 seconds according to Uptime Monitors and after Up and running for another day. Few days ago it went down, and never come back.. It just didnt restore itself.. p  pstrongWhat I Didstrongbr Digging around at wpadmin wordpress said me that the database is broken. I tried to repair it by inbuilt wordpresss tools. It did repair some of them, but couldnt repair one table. I logged in MyPhpAdmin and repaired it by inbuilt tools and site fortunately went back..p  pWhat might cause such outagep  pI have to note that no any developments or changes were made to the site for many months..  It is a restaurant site, it just lives on it own.p  pI have read other topics.. but to be honest they are not quite helpful.. quite basic stuff..p  pOne important thing.. the site hosted and managed not by meon linux VPS.. On that VPS sits MySQl, cPanel, ssd disks, DNS... so basically all in one. The issue havent touched the rest 10 wordpress websites. Only one particular. Admin swears that on his side all is up and running. And puts pressure on me, that this is my fault as a web developer. And the sites owner is looking for someone to blame onp  pI tried to check errorlogin cPanel.. but for some reason there is only last 10 lines.. dont know why.. p  pI have some meeting with admin and website owner to investigate this issue.. Last outage was for about 3 hours on Friday evening.. I presume owner have had lost some clients that day.p  pWell... thats the story I hope I listed all what I knowp  ul liWhat an admin would advice me to look for li liWhat is the troubleshooting plan for such problemsli liIs it something related to botsspiders Or some hackers trying to put down my site Where can I check thatli liIs there anywhere I could to dig MySql logs outli ul  pThe point of this topic is to learn how to troubleshot such issues on my own. And also learn some preventive measures. Such outages not fun for clients, especially on Fridays.p  pPlease advice me if you need more information.. I will try to provide it...p  pP.S.p  pI would put this question in wordpress section, but not sure the answers lay only in this one subject.p  pstrongEDITstrongbr Here is a log file for that day for those who is fancy enough to read them.its huge a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.coms75xwop8m9qxrpo8wordpresserrorestablishingdatabaseconnectionlog relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.coms75xwop8m9qxrpo8wordpresserrorestablishingdatabaseconnectionlogap  pstrongEDIT 2strongbr After checking for high spikes and hits as suggested below by aconrad I found out that there was 40 higher rate of page views. But there is quite natural reason, the cofounder of the business was having a show on our local national TV. So that is the cause of additional 40 hits..br But I still believe 443 views per day is nothing.. and that still doesnt explain why database table was broken. p  pstrongEDIT 3strongbr Ive got from admin MySQl log..

Negative 305 pI have a codebashcode script running a codeJavacode application every 5 min. The Java application gets records  from a table meeting certain conditions, from the codeOraclecode database.  I have to do several validations on each individual record returned in the codeResultsetcode and if the current record passes the validations,I add the particular record in an codeArrayListcode. And finally when all records are validated, do a batch update on these records.p  pThe problem is that the validations take time and new records are added by that time. So there are times when a previous script has not yet finished its execution, when a second script is running. What i want is to lock the current nonupdated records so that another script does not fetch them from the database. p  pThe best I can think of is having a status column in the table.p  ul listatus 0  Not yet processed by the applicationli listatus 1  In processli listatus 2  Already processedli ul  pThe Java application would fetch records where the status is 0, set them to 1 and perform the validations consequently. Finally after validations success or not, the status is set to 2.p  pCan you think of a better alternative as it seems a bit clunky.p

The reason is the alignment to 8 bytes after the integer c. The array d should start at the 6th byte of the struct and not at the 9th byte. I used codepragma pack1code but it didnt solve the problem. I cannot change the order of fields in the struct. Do you have any idea how can I solve this problem Thanksp

Negative 305 pIs there something in firefox addon through which we can register a callback which gets invoked when the addon is closed by clicking the x button on the leftp  pWhat I need is, when a user closes the addon bar using the x button, my extension loaded on that bar should be notified. Now what happens is, even though the user closes the addon bar, it is not getting closed instead it just hides. p  pIf we can be informed through a callback that the user has clicked on x button, then i could listen to that in the extension.p

Negative 305 pIn my company we are currently upgrading to GF V3 from V2. We have around 20 domains and we keep the logs outside the domain logs folder.p  pIn GF V2, I set this by changing every log related entry in domain.xml to codelogsglassfishcom.sun.aas.domainNameserver.logcodep  pI did that on every domain domain.xml and GF resolved that to the corresponding domain name. This no longer works on GF 3. I changed it first on domain.xml but I saw that the logging.properties file was overriding that so I changed the line emcom.sun.enterprise.server.logging.GFFileHandler.fileem value for the one I mentioned I used on GF 2 but the domainName system property does not get resolved, its just treated literally, so I end up with a emcom.sun.aas.domainNameem folder inside my logs folder.p  pSo my question is how can I get this system property resolved The documentation says I still can use it. Does it have to do with the fact that the logging.properties file is not XML Is there a way I can bypass the logging.properties file to see if the variable would get resolved from the settings in the domain.xml filep

Negative 305 pI think I have stumbled upon a quirk in Simple Injectors codeRegisterDecoratorcode. It occurs even in the most recent 2.5.0. I have a situation where I want to decorate a closed generic type, for example codeICommandHandlerltMessageCommandgtcode, with a decorator that takes via constructor injection an inner handler of type codeICommandHandlerltMessageCommandgtcode, but also another type of handler, say codeICommandHandlerltLogCommandgtcode. Even though these command handler types are distinct, SimpleInjector seems to get confused and throws an exception when I call codeRegisterDecoratorcode on such a decorator typep  blockquote   pArgumentException For the container to be able to use MessageLogger as a decorator, its constructor must include a single parameter of type codeICommandHandlerltMessageCommandgtcode or codeFuncltICommandHandlerltMessageCommandgtgtcode  i.e. the type of the instance that is being decorated.

When I instead do the followingp  precodeJsonConvert.DeserializeObjectltIDictionaryltstring, ISetltstringgtgtgtjson codepre  peverything works just fine. So it appears that the codeTypeNameHandlingcode setting changingomitting the format does not change anything actually breaks deserialization.p  pI found that, if I dont set the codeTypeNameHandlingcode settings, the serialized codetypecode properties are simply ignored. I.e., when deserializing, the type information is taken solely from the target type where they are resolved. This works.p  pWhen setting the codeTypeNameHandlingcode, type resolution happens via reflection within the Json.NET assembly, which does not have a dependency on the codeSystemcode assembly and therefore fails to resolve the codeISetcode interface. I can fix this by registering on codeAppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolvecode and resolving the assembly like sop  precodeif args.Name  System       return typeof ISetltgt.Assembly  codepre  pbut this seems very fragile to me, as it solves the problem for only this one specific assembly and I have to add another case for every assembly I need somewhere.p  pDoes anyone have experience on how to solve this Any help is greatly appreciatedp

The warning was like this onep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVdcvw.png altTFS baseless mergep  pWe proceeded with merging. Then at some point it came to one developer that we forgot to update our branch B from branch A and that we need changes from changeset 1 in our branch B. But the problem is that changeset 1 has some code lines which were later modified in changeset 3 branch C which we merged.p  pNow the question is, what will happen to branch B when we merge changeset 1 from A into B emafterem we have done the baseless merge of changeset 3 from C into B p  pWill TFS be smart enough to keep the changes from the newest changeset 3 when it finds the conflicting code lines of changeset 1, even after we did the baseless mergep  pP.S.

Negative 305 pI emfinallyem started using an IDE IntelliJ and was amazed at how much time it saved me on my last project.  On my next project I want to keep with the trend of using good tools that will save me time.p  pIm setting up my dev environment for a new project and I want to set up my development environment so that I spend more time coding and less time deploying and manually tasting. I want to be using tools like Git and Vagrant and all the devops things which save time in the long run once youve invested in learning them.p  pI want to be able to have a dev environment that runs on my laptop, a staging environment that goes on the web Some integrations such as Facebook are hard to test without a live site, also I want staging to be setup nearly exactly the same as production, and a production environment for release.p  pThere are small changes that are appropriate for dev and staging environments compared to production dont want the staging environment able to accidentally email actual  customers, for instance.p  pI see the need to have certain places in the code where the a different domain name is used depending on what environment the code is running in, or perhaps a mock API gets used rather than the actual API, perhaps emails all get dumped to a testing domain name, etc.p  pIt seems like the safest way is to have code assume it is running in development mode unless it has been told it is in staging or production.p  pWhat good techniques are there to tell code what environment it is running in Environment variables Constants included in a library p  pAnd what build tools do people use for things like HTML where the compiling might be putting in production or staging domain names and perhaps minifying.  I like to edit my code and reload my browser as I develop  perhaps thats a crutch I should stop being used to, but Id like a workflow that makes it easy to do that. p  pAlso want to make it hard to screw up. I wouldnt want to accidentally deploy code in development mode into production. Ive never worked with CI tools, is this a reason people use CI tools  is that something they help with Are they worth using when you dont have a large team yetp  pSuggestions that work nicely with IntelliJ especially appreciated.p
Negative 305 pWhen building up a collection inside an codeOptioncode, each attempt to make the next member of the collection might fail, making the collection as a whole a failure, too. Upon the first failure to make a member, Id like to give up immediately and return codeNonecode for the whole collection. What is an idiomatic way to do this in Scalap  pHeres one approach Ive come up withp  precodedef findPartByNamename String Option[Part]  ...  def allPartsnames Seq[String] Option[Seq[Part]]    names.foldLeftSomeSeq.empty Option[Seq[Part]]      result, name gt result match        case Someparts gt         findPartByNamename flatMap  part gt Someparts  part        case None gt None         codepre  pIn other words, if any call to codefindPartByNamecode returns codeNonecode, codeallPartscode returns codeNonecode. Otherwise, codeallPartscode returns a codeSomecode containing a collection of codePartscode, all of which are guaranteed to be valid. An empty collection is OK.p  pThe above has the advantage that it stops calling codefindPartByNamecode after the first failure. But the codefoldLeftcode still iterates once for each name, regardless.p  pHeres a version that bails out as soon as codefindPartByNamecode returns a codeNonecodep  precodedef allParts2names Seq[String] Option[Seq[Part]]  Some   for name lt names yield findPartByNamename match      case Somepart gt part     case None gt return None     codepre  pI currently find the second version more readable, but a what seems most readable is likely to change as I get more experience with Scala, b I get the impression that early codereturncode is frowned upon in Scala, and c neither one seems to make whats going on especially obvious to me.p  pThe combination of allornothing and give up on the first failure seems like such a basic programming concept, I figure there must be a common Scala or functional idiom to express it.p
Negative 305 pI need to employ a realtime time validation in a PHP form.  Basically, when a visitor is filling out the form its a order form btw, and comes to the pickup time field, the visitor should only be allowed to enter a time thats one hour 60 minutes from the time they are filling out the form.  If they fail to enter the appropriate time, it should echo an error.  p  pI dont need real time validation, I need realtime, strongtimestrong validation. I mean filling out a form field, and have the code check the current time the user is putting in eg. 200pm and respond accordingly. If the time is 200pm while filling out the field, an error should occur because the time is not at least 60 minutes from the current time 200pm.p  pHow to do this PHP or otherwise, I only know HTML and CSS. p

Negative 305 pThis may seem like a dumb question, but Id like to inquire about the best way to sort in reverse order a sortable structure any kind, could be codeListcode of a class codeMyClasscode that doesnt implement codeComparablecodep  pFirst off, since codeMyClasscode doesnt implement codeComparablecode and I want to sort it, I create a codeComparatorcode, something like thisp  precodepublic class MyClassComparator implements ComparatorltMyClassgt      Override     public int compareMyClass o1, MyClass o2          return o1.getMyField.compareToo2.getMyField       codepre  pThis, of course, sorts MyClass objects according to the natural ordering of MyClass.MyField. But I want the reverse order.p  pI could of course just hardcode the reverse order in the codecompareMyClass o1, MyClass o2code method. Something likep  precodeif o1.getMyField.compareToo2.getMyField gt 0 return 1 if o1.getMyField.compareToo2.getMyField lt 0 return 1 return 0 codepre  pAnoter alternative is leaving the code of MyClassComparator as I initially suggested, and using codepublic static ltTgt ComparatorltTgt reverseOrderComparatorltTgt cmpcode from codejava.util.Collectionscode to pass an instance of codeMyClassComparatorcode and get a reverse comparator.p  pAnd a third alternative, that I think is wrong, could be sorting my codeLinkedListltMyClassgtcode with the natural order Comparator and fetch the elements from last to first. codeLinkedListcode is a doubly linked list, so it should handle this perfectly. The problem is that I would always have to get a specific codeIteratorcode instead of just using a codefor eachcode loop minor and, of course, that I initially wanted to sort ANY sortable structure, and I cant guarantee that it will be a doubly linked list or anything that handles well iterating through it in reverse order.p  pConsidering that Im quite certain cant ever be 100 certain that I wont be using the natural order of codeMyClasscode objects, just the reverse order, what would be the best way to obtain my reverse comparatorp  pThank you.p

Negative 305 pI am a student and as a project Im developing some software to talk to a CAN that would read from that can through a serial over USB interface. Im confused on what occurs when I receive these bytes. Im receiving them in 127128 format and then converting them to an int via the java operator amp 0xFF. p  pFrom there, what is going on with these bytes I want to be able to find the STX and ETX as well as the data in the packets Im receiving. How do I do that I can find these bytes integer values and that is about it. Im receiving this data through JSSCs readBytes into a byte[]. p  pThe STX is 0x02, where do I find that and how in my byte array Im only receiving integers. p  pAm I doing something completely wrong on the receiving end, or is this data serialized and I dont know anything about it p  pPlease forgive my newbyness. Im just trying to learn how to RX and TX to a CAN.p  pThanksp

I removed the meat of the code, but all that is doing is updating user info on parse, and on the disk so its not relevant.

How can I make the activityIndicatorView cover the title layerp  pEDIT FOR CLARIFICATION, The activityIndicator is positioned correctly. It is in the middle of the button and can be seen there just fine. The issue is that it DOES NOT COVER the top layer of the button which has the title GO.

Negative 305 pIs it possible technically to provide a Today Extension as an in app purchase. As far as i can see, soon after you install the main target, the extension target is also getting deployed. I dont see a way to limit that. My idea is to provide one extension for free and other two remaining extensions as in app purchase. Since each extension lives as a seperate target in the xcode, am not sure how to proceed. Any insight will be really helpfulp  pRegards, Kesavap

Negative 305 pIve seen a few threads regarding this but none that seems to help in my case.

However, I have no way of knowing what property is causing the issue.  Ive looked at the results list before the call and everything looks fine.  There are definitely null properties but none that are Required.p  pIll include the error output below although its doesnt format well.

This isnt a huge issue because I have changed the animation time and the black background is barely visible, but I have a feeling there is a more elegant solution.p  pHere is my code to shift the codeframecodep  precode BOOLtextFieldShouldBeginEditingUITextField textField       Animate frame up if lower textfields are tapped     if [textField isEqualemailField]  [textField isEqualdobField]  [textField isEqualniNumField]          [UIView beginAnimationsnil                     contextNULL]         [UIView setAnimationDuration0.35f]         CGRect frame  self.view.frame         frame.origin.y  210         [self.view setFrameframe]         [UIView commitAnimations]      else           Return frame to original position if other textfields are tapped         [self dismissKeyboard]          return YES    voiddismissKeyboard          [UIView beginAnimationsnil                         contextNULL]         [UIView setAnimationDuration0.15f]         CGRect frame  self.view.frame         frame.origin.y  0         [self.view setFrameframe]         [UIView commitAnimations]  codepre  pHere is a brief screenshot of what Im trying to describe. Left picture is the codeViewControllercode normally, right picture is when the codeframecode has been shifted upwards. You can see vaguely almost in line with the second row of characters is where the codeframecode stops.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comS6lRU.png altLeft Normal frame. Right frame.origin.y alteredp  pI realise this doesnt seem like an issue because it is barely visible at all, but I have had to speed up the animation hiding the keyboard or else the codeframecode drags behind and the black background becomes visible. I am wondering is there a way to change this colour Or is that something we dont have access to If anyone can suggest a more elegant method for what I am trying to do, Id gladly take a better solution. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 305 pWe have a Python interface for our application.

Ive posted the before and after below, and I was wondering if more experienced eyes could give it a once over and explain why the change I made fixed the problem I described.p  pBefore Fixp  precodebool deleteNodeNode ampheadRef, int delVal      Node delPtr  for use in deletion     Node scan                                 Node prev                                  if headRef  nullptr            if headRefgtdata  delVal                delPtr  headRef             headRef  headRefgtnext             delete delPtr           else               scan  headRefgtnext             prev  headRef              while scan  nullptr ampamp scangtdata  delVal                    scan  scangtnext                 prev  prevgtnext                           if scangtdata  delVal                    delPtr  scan                 prevgtnext  delPtrgtnext                 delete delPtr               else return false                   return true  codepre  pAfter Changes have been markedp  precodebool deleteNodeNode ampheadRef, int delVal      Node delPtr  for use in deletion     Node scan                                 Node prev                                  if headRef  nullptr           CHANGE 1         return false      if headRefgtdata  delVal            delPtr  headRef         headRef  headRefgtnext         delete delPtr       else           scan  headRefgtnext         prev  headRef          while scan  nullptr ampamp scangtdata  delVal                scan  scangtnext             prev  prevgtnext                   if scan  nullptr         CHANGE 2              delPtr  scan             prevgtnext  delPtrgtnext             delete delPtr           else return false          return true  codepre  pThanks in advanced for your help.p

Negative 305 pIm trying to understand how the initialization code works that ships with Keil realview v4 for the STM32 microcontrollers. Specifically, Im trying to understand how the stack is initialized. p  pIn the a hrefhttpinfocenter.arm.comhelpindex.jsptopiccom.arm.doc.kui0099aarmlibcihhdahf.htm relnofollowdocumentationa on ARMs website it mentions that one of the routines in startupxxx.s, a hrefhttpinfocenter.arm.comhelpindex.jsptopiccom.arm.doc.kui0099aarmlibcihhdahf.htm relnofollowcodeuserinitialstackheapcodea, should not use more than 88 bytes of stack. Do you know where that limitation is coming fromp  pIt seems that when the reset handler calls SystemInit it is executing a couple functions in a C environment which I believe means it is using some form of a temporary stack it allocates a few automatic variables. However, all of those stackd items should be out of scope once it returns back and then calls codemaincode which is where codeuserinitialstackheapcode is called from. p  pSo why is there this requirement for codeuserinitialstackheapcode to not use more than 88 bytes Does the rest of codemaincode use a ton of stack or somethingp  pAny explanation of the cortexm3 stack architecture as it relates to the startup sequence would be fantastic. p

Negative 305 pI have an app with a tabview as the initial view controller. Segues hook up the tabview buttons to the other view controllers, and everything is fine except for the masterdetail view. Masterdetail are two different views. None of this is in code, it is all in the storyboard.p  pWhen I go into the master view, and then use the tab bar controller to go to other views everything works great. When I go into the detail view and use the tab bar for navigation, everything works fine as well until I try to go to the master view. When I try to go back to the master view using the tab bar, I am directed to the detail view. I would always like to start with the master and then proceed to the detail.p  pTo state this a little differently, when I use the tab bar to leave the master view and them come back to the master it works fine. When I leave the detail view and then use the tab bar to return to the master, I am directed to the detail view.

Negative 305 pIn my app I have a custom directive, written by someone else that validates and formats several different form fields ex. name, address, phone, credit card number, DOB, etc. If the user inputs invalid data, codenginvalidcode is added to that particular form elements CLASS attribute. There is a function bound to the strongsubmitstrong of the form that checks to see if all fields contain valid data before allowing it to submit. Something likep  precode  app.directivevalidateForms, function          var form  angular.elementelem       scope.isSubmitted  false        form.bindsubmit, function            scope.isSubmitted  true           ifform.hasClassnginvalid return false            codepre  pAnd this directive is applied to the  element in the view.p  precodeltform namerequestinfo idrequestinfo validateformsgt codepre  pI have been tasked with displaying error messages below the fields containing invalid data.

Negative 305 pI have multiple images floating left or right in the main content of a webpage. In order to alert users to the fact that they are links, I have a simple 1px border appear when the mouse hovers over them. To avoid the images moving when this happens, I subtract a pixel from the margin of each side upon hover. This works fine in Firefox and IE11. p  pHowever, in Chrome the picture will be pushed down by the number of pixels changing, emifem the image HTML is immediately followed by plain text which it often is, of course. As well as being jarring, this can move text around, looking very unprofessional. In the two cases where the image HTML is followed by codeltulgtcode, there is no problem for some reason. Preceding text or HTML seems to make no difference.p  pI initially used negative margin values for the hover, so I thought it perhaps didnt like that. However, adding an initial margin to the images and then removing that upon hover did not resolve the problem, despite visibly freeing space above it. I have also tried increasing the pixel size of the border, but it has the same effect. Using padding instead obviously doesnt help, as its on the wrong side of the border.p  pCan anyone spot a flaw in my CSS, or suggest a workaround Thanks.p  precodeimg.alignleft  margin 1px 20px 20px 1px float left   img.alignright  margin 1px 1px 20px 20px float right   ahover img.alignleft  clear left border solid 1px 00b1e5 margin 0px  19px 19px 0px   ahover img.alignright  clear right border solid 1px 00b1e5 margin 0px 0px 19px 19px  codepre

Negative 305 pWhy can I not have a interface inside of a inner class Why are they inherently codestaticcode Sorry if its a stupid question, Ive tried my best to google this again and again but I cant seem to wrap it around my head. As in why cannot I declare these in inner classeslocal classes p  pAlso just as a confirmation, the reason we can have static final variables in a interface is because they do not specify the state or any of that sort of the implementation right If we lose codestaticcode and use just a final, we need a instance which makes no sense cause you cant instantiate a interface. Sorry, I really am confused, and I know I should just make another question but I think these two questions are somewhat related.p

On my current computer I have 3 devices. My algorithm above only distributes the work to devices 1 and 2. Device 3 always gets left out because devices 1 and 2 finish so quickly that they can snatch up more work items before 3 gets a chance. p  p2 Even with devices 1 and 2 running together, I only see a very, very mild speed increase. For instance if i were to assign all work items to device 1 it might take 10 seconds to complete, and if I assign all work items to device 2 it might take 11 seconds to complete, but if I try to split the work between them, combined it might take 89 seconds when what I would hope for might be between 45 seconds. I get the feeling that they might not really be running in parallel with each other the way I want. p  pHow do I fix these issuesp

Negative 305 pI installed Android Studio on an old laptop. 6GB of RAM and Windows 7 with JRE7. The machine shows its age sometimes, but I figured I would give it a shot. I got everything setup alright, but it really takes its time spinning up new projects running a configuration. I even got my Nexus 7 switched over to developer mode so that I could debug on it and sent the blank activity hello world app over.p  pSo I have this other computer, a desktop, with a more modern processor and 16GB of RAM and I figure Ill give that a try. Oh yeah, its running Windows 8.1. Android Studio installed and I made sure to update the SDKs and install the Google USB driver in the Android Studio SDK manager. Still going good at this point. Then I plug in the Nexus and the fun stops.p  pI keep getting this port reset failure. I was expecting a message, but not that one. On the laptop I waited for the warning message opened Device Manager and then installed the Google USB Driver from the location listed in the SDK manager hover tooltip. After that the old laptop could connect. The newer desktop really doesnt want to play ball though.p  pWhen I dug deeper it looked like Windows was trying to use AsusAICharger as the driver for the Nexus. I Googled it and its a free app so I uninstalled it and restarted the machine. No such luck. Windows 8 is still giving me that port reset failure message. Even before that ... and after... I tried changing the drivers and pointing at the Google USB Drivers like I did on the Windows 7 machine, but it keeps coming back with the message that the drivers are already uptodate. However, when I look at the driver info it comes back with this message that no drivers have been installed.p  pAt this point, Im doing a mini freak out. Did I fry my tablet It turns out the answer is no. It turns on fine and the apps run ... AND when I take it back over to the old Windows 7 machine and plug it in the laptop reads it just fine. The laptop says oh yeah, theres my old buddy Nexus7.p  pSo why is the desktop throwing a fit Why cant it just get over it and let me install those drivers Anyone run into problems like this before or have any ideas on what to do nextp

Negative 305 pSo I have an incredibly simple HTML survey form that I created that only has one select drop down input and one text input field. The text input only shows up if the select field is on the other option. So that is all well and good, I have JavaScript handling all of it and it works great.p  pNow the problem appears when I try POST the form values to the PHP file and then insert the values into my database table.

Negative 305 pIve been learning how to program with java and I havent got any clear explanation about the difference of codeLinkedListcodes codetoArrayT[] acode and codetoArraycode method. The second one simply returns all of the elements within the LinkedList object as an array, right But, what about the first onep  pEDIT p  pI mean, I read the documentation from oracle, it says p  blockquote   pReturns an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper   sequence from first to last element the runtime type of the   returned array is that of the specified array. strongIf the list fits in   the specified array, it is returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is   allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and the size of   this list. If the list fits in the specified array with room to spare   i.e., the array has more elements than the list, the element in the   array immediately following the end of the list is set to null. This   is useful in determining the length of the list only if the caller   knows that the list does not contain any null elements.strongp      pLike the toArray method, this method acts as bridge between   arraybased and collectionbased APIs. Further, this method allows   precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,   under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.p blockquote  pI dont understand the meaning of the sentences displayed in bold.p

Negative 305 pSo, this one is a little bit tricky to ask and answer, because I cannot show any code or provide any links. Anyway, I am using the a hrefhttpwww.appgyver.comsteroids relnofollowAppgyver Steroidsa framework and am currently developing an app. I want to embed another webpage inside my app, and have tried several different approaches. The webpage I want to embed consists of multiple iframes, which get updated depending on a script and a bunch of list selectors. When I try to embed the webpage, the iframe forces a refresh every time I select an item in any of the lists, causing the item to remain unselected and no script to be run. Here is the interesting part, when I instead embed it using the  tag, it works fine No problem what so ever So what is going on here p  pThe reason I want to use an iframe instead of the embed tag is because I need to access the DOM structure of the embedded webpage, and get data from it using jQuery. If there is a way to do it with the codeltembedgtcode tag too, that would also solve my problem.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 305 pIve been reading lately about DNS stronga hrefhttpunixwiz.nettechtipsiguidekaminskydnsvuln.html relnofollowcachepoisoning attacksastrong.  Essentially they are possible simply because an attacker can guess the DNS message transaction ID, since it is only a 16bit integer.  Even if the integer is random, its still possible for a flurry of DNS packets to coincidentally match 1 of 216 packets in a short time window.p  pSo a second security measure is port randomization.  If the UDP source port is random, an attacker would have to guess embothem the source port emandem the transaction ID in a short time window, which is usually not feasible.  But I read that older versions of DNS software such as BIND versions before 9 did NOT perform port randomization, and are therefore vulnerable.p  pThis brings me to the question  dont most UNIX OSs like Linux and BSD emautomaticallyem assign random ports when a codeSOCKDGRAMcode is used without a prior call to codebindcode  I thought that was the whole idea with ephemeral ports.  Why does an application like BIND have to go out of its way to perform port randomization  p  pMy understanding is that, essentially, an OS like Linux will have a RANGE of ephemeral ports available for use with each process.  A process can call codebindcode to bind a UDP socket to a specific port.  But if a UDP socket is used i.e. codesendcode is called without first calling codebindcode, the OS will lazily assign a random ephemeral port to the socket.  So, why were older versions of BIND not performing port randomization automaticallyp

Negative 305 pSimple table examplep  precodeCatID    ParentID    Name    DisplayOrder  1         NULL         A        1 2         1            A1       1 3         1            A2       2 4         NULL         B        2  etc. codepre  pI want to order by parents, and children within that parent. But I also want to obey the DisplayOrder. So first by parent by display order, and then children within each parent, by their display order. One level deep only. I want to avoid a complex query if possible, such as most CTE examples Ive seen.p  pWell, this works p  precodeSELECT  FROM      SELECT             CatID     ,ParentID     ,DisplayOrder AS LevelOne     ,NULL AS LevelTwo      FROM Table WHERE ParentID IS NULL      UNION ALL      SELECT         c.CatID       ,c.ParentID       ,d.DisplayOrder AS LevelOne       ,c.DisplayOrder AS LevelTwo      FROM Table c WHERE ParentID IS NOT NULL     INNER JOIN Table d ON c.ParentID  d.CatID  AS Cats ORDER BY Cats.LevelOne, Cats.LevelTwo codepre  pOkay so the above query works fine, but only on one condition... The DisplayOrder of the parents must be different. So if two parents have 1 as the DisplayOrder  for whatever reason , then result set ends up a complete mess. As long as I have the parents display order in sequence, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. Then it works. I understand emwhyem, but trying to find the best solution to solve it and account for the possibility of duplicate display orders.p

However, starting this HTTP server is not instantaneous it takes a little time for the IEDriverServer.exe to initialize it and be ready to receive HTTP requests from the language binding clients. When you call new InternetExplorerDriver from your Java code, the Java language bindings launch IEDriverServer.exe, but then has to wait for the HTTP server to be ready. It waits by polling the server with the HttpClient class until it receives a valid response.

Negative 305 pDoesnt using Browserify to load scripts like jQuery preclude the potentials benefits of using a CDN outlined herep  pa hrefhttpencosia.com3reasonswhyyoushouldletgooglehostjqueryforyou relnofollowhttpencosia.com3reasonswhyyoushouldletgooglehostjqueryforyouap  blockquote   pPotentially the greatest benefit of using the Google AJAX Libraries   CDN is that your users may not need to download jQuery at all. No   matter how well optimized your site is, if youre hosting jQuery   locally then your users must download it at least once. Each of your   users probably already has dozens of identical copies of jQuery in   their browsers cache, but those copies of jQuery are ignored when   they visit your site. However, when a browser sees references to   CDNhosted copies of jQuery, it understands that all of those   references do refer to the exact same file. With all of these CDN   references point to exactly the same URLs, the browser can trust that   those files truly are identical and wont waste time rerequesting the   file if its already cached. Thus, the browser is able to use a single   copy thats cached ondisk, regardless of which site the CDN   references appear on.p blockquote  pif so, would that mean you would want to include jQuery in the codeltheadgtcode and keep it out of your Browserify bundlep

Negative 305 pim new to Pygame, and still learning Python. Im using Python 3.4.  I followed this amazing game creation tutorial a hrefhttppythonprogramming.netpygamepython3part1intro relnofollowhttppythonprogramming.netpygamepython3part1introa after completing the lessons I decided to change the game slightly, and have succeeded in added some more movement and fixed some bugs. however now im trying to figure out how to change the sprite when I press an arrow key, as to make it appeal like it tilting.   I have a file call racecar.png which is the plane and moveright which looks like it is tilted. My end goal is to have it when I press the right arrow, the moveright.png is displayed until I release the key, in which case it returns to racecar.png. I have looked up how to use sprite sheets, which failed, how to animate, watched youtube, googled my problem but I cant find anyone else who has this problem. most of what I found talked about moving the sprite around the screen. here is the codep  precodeimport pygame import random import time  pygame.init  carwidth  100 carheight  100  displaywidth  800 displayheight  600  gameDisplay

As a result, it can appear to a fast client that the server has hung because the client can be waiting for a minute or two after sending the the last few bytes before getting the response.p  pIs there a way either within Tomcat or within the servlet API to throttle back the speed at which the server accepts the file I would like it to appear to the client that the server is accepting the file at for example 10MBsecond rather than it accepting the file at 50MBsecond and then taking a few minutes after receiving the body to return a response.p  pThanks.p

Negative 305 pAs the Title states, I have a stock dropdown menu with some CSS layout and stuff. The problem is, as soon as I add my D3 code into the page, the dropdown menu stops working. They only relate to each other in one function and I really dont get why they affect each other.p  pJavascriptp  precodeltscript srcd3d3.v3.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt function

Negative 305 pIve been tearing my hair out over this for two days, and every time I think Ive solved it, it just pops up again.p  pIn my codeheader.phpcode I have the following code for displaying the number of items in the cart, and a simple showhide div displaying the items themselves, along with a totalp  precodelta idminiart hrefltphp echo WCgtcartgtgetcarturl gt classcart icon red relativegt     ltdiv classnumber boldgt         ltphp echo sprintfd, WCgtcartgtcartcontentscount gt     ltdivgt      ltdivgt         ltphp returnIconcart    This function simply displays an inline SVG  gt     ltdivgt      ltdiv idcartcontentsgt         ltdiv classwidgetshoppingcartcontentgt             ltphp woocommerceminicart gt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltagt codepre  pI also have a filter to return the cart fragments via AJAX when a new item is addedp  precodefunction woocommerceheaderaddtocartfragmentfragments       obstart      gt         ltdiv classnumber boldgt             ltphp echo sprintfd, WCgtcartgtcartcontentscount gt         ltdivgt      ltphp      fragments[minicart .number]  obgetclean      return fragments   addfilterwoocommerceaddtocartfragments, woocommerceheaderaddtocartfragment codepre  pThe filter always works  Ive never had a problem with that. Whats totally throwing me is that the standard, preprocessed calls in the header codecartcontentscountcode amp codewoocommerceminicartcode seem to be totally cached. If I add a new item, the AJAX will update both to display strong1strong and the actual item added but if I change the page or refresh, it defaults back to strong0strong and strongNo itemsstrong. If I go to my cart, despite the minicart still saying I have nothing, the emactualem cart page displays the cart contents correctly.p  pIt only appears to update if I go to my cart page and delete something from my cart for example, if Ive emactuallyem got 7 items in my cart but the minicart displays 0, and then delete an item from my cart, suddenly the minicart will corectly display 6. However, from that point it will stay at 6, even if I add another dozen items. p  pHeres what Ive triedp  ul listrongChange the classesIDs of the elementsstrong i,e, codeminicartcode to codetinycartcode, etc.  works once, then immediately starts caching again.li listrongTurned off the filtersstrong This has no effect, since the filter is only for returning fragments when new items are added. Also worth noting that there doesnt appear to be any kind of AJAX call fired at page load that would interfere with the minicart display.li listrongTurned off all plugins except WooCommercestrong made no difference.li listrongTurned off Enable AJAX add to cart buttons on archives in WC settingsstrong This emkindaem works, insofar as it reloads the entire page when an item is added, and the minicart displays number of cart items correctly emhoorayem, but obviously disables the ability to add items via AJAX, which is a requirement of the site emboo.emli listrongDeleting my own codeminicart.phpcode template filestrong Just in case, to see if that was an issue. Made no difference.li listrongPutting the codewoocommerceminicartcode function literally anywhere elsestrong This, infuriatingly, works. If I take this function and the codeecho sprintfd, WCgtcartgtcartcontentscountcode line and put them emanywhereem  within the header, within the page body, even inside the emsame elementem thats getting cached, they work. They display the correct number of items, and the correct list of items. But the other calls to this function, as noted above, still appear to be cached.li ul  pAs noted, this occurs even with no other plugins running it happens both locally a completely standard XAMPP installation on Windows and remotely a niftier nginx setup, slightly newer PHP version, and neither have any kind of caching enabled. p  pAny suggestions would be very gratefully received, as I have totally lost my mind on this one.p
Negative 305 pI making a Windows 10 Universal App to connect to my database and display the table. I build sort of a api on my server that if called it returns mysql table data in json. Now, this recived json data wont be always the same, so I want to display whatever table from my database on my server, by record. So that it will show only one record at the time, and when you press forward it will go to the next record. I can figure this out on my ownthe buttons. But I dont know how to deserialize the unknow json data which will be always diffrent from table to table and display it on table by record. I tried the Dictionarylt deserialize but it gave me an error, that the recived string json must be a json object, which I later convertet it to but it still wasnt working. I doing this just for learning and personal project. If anyone knows a sollution it would be great  p
