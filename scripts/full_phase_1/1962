Positive 1962 pSo Ive looked all over for an example on how to do this, but Im still stuck.p  pI have an executable that I want to disassemble, modify the assembly code, and reassemble it into an executable.

Positive 1962 pI am newbie on XV6 and currently trying to understand it working. I have successfully downloaded the source code,built the kernel using make and I am able to run it under qemu.p  pIn xv6 folder I can see many executables like cat,sh,rm etc. Out of curiosity I want to run one of these exes in gdb directly without using qemu. As per my understanding,i cannot run the xv6s kernel executable directly in gdb as kernel requires raw x86 hardware to run and hence I have to run it through qemu as it will emulate the environment for the kernel.But,cat or rm are user programs and ideally should run in an isolate manner.I tried the below mentioned steps in gdb.p  pgdb catbreak mainrunp  pAs soon as I run the exe,a SIGKILL is received and the exe terminates.Same happened with rm and sh.p  pIs my understanding wrong or am I missing out something Some help will be useful.p  pThanks in advance.p
Positive 1962 pSo Im trying to debug a program that takes user input through the terminal. Im using the GNU Debugger gdb to do so. When I reach the point where the program is waiting for user input it no longer allows me to control gdb and instead forces me to give input to the program.p  pThe difficulty is, I want to debug the program at this exact point, but before there is any input given. So how do I switch between giving input to the program and controlling gdb Ive tried googling and searching through the manual for gdb but cant seem to find anything on switching between input to the program and input to gdb.p

Make breakpoint pending on future shared library load y or [n] y Breakpoint 2 strcpy pending.code but when debugging  GDB skip second breakpoint and go directly to third.p  pWhat I doing wrong Thanks for any advice.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pI find answers  While compilation, if in code is some specific function as strcpy or memcpy, GCC use his own builtin function, not function from headers. Its increase efficiently of programm but in exchange we cannot set breakpoint on it. To bypass this issue, while comipilation, one should add this codefnobuiltincode. It disable builtin function and give a possibility to set breakpoint on demand line.br More info a hrefhttpsgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocsgcc4.1.2gccCDialectOptions.htmlCDialectOptions relnofollow titleoptional titleherea p

Negative 1962 pThere is a general rule of OO design that you should model isa relationships using inheritance and hasa relationships using containmentaggregation and forwardingdelegation. This is further narrowed by the admonishment from the GoF that you should generally favor containment over inheritance, suggesting, perhaps, that if you could make a strong case for either one in a particular situation, that containment should generally get the nod due to the maintenance problems inheritance can sometimes cause.p  pI understand the reasoning behind this thinking, and I dont necessarily disagree with it. However, when I see a class with scores of methods, each just forwarding to some instance variable, I see a form of code duplication. Code duplication is, in my opinion, the ultimate code smell. Reimplementing an enormous protocol of methods just because the relationship between two classes isnt strictly isa seems like overkill. It is additional, unnecessary code added to the system, code that now needs be tested and documented like any other part of the systemcode that you likely wouldnt have had to write if you just inherited.p  pDo the costs of adhering to this containmentoverinheritance principal ever outweigh its benefitsp

Negative 1962 pThank you all for your help. A number of you posted as I should have expected answers indicating my whole approach was wrong, or that lowlevel code should never have to know whether or not it is running in a container.  I would tend to agree.  However, Im dealing with a complex legacy application and do not have the option of doing a major refactoring for the current problem.p  pLet me step back and ask the question the motivated my original question.p  pI have a legacy application running under JBoss, and have made some modifications to lowerlevel code.  I have created a unit test for my modification.  In order to run the test, I need to connect to a database.p  pThe legacy code gets the data source this wayp  pjndiName is a defined stringp  precodeContext ctx  new InitialContext DataSource dataSource  DataSource ctx.lookupjndiName codepre  pMy problem is that when I run this code under unit test, the Context has no data sources defined.  My solution to this was to try to see if Im running under the application server and, if not, create the test DataSource and return it.  If I am running under the app server, then I use the code above.p  pSo, my emrealem question is What is the correct way to do this  Is there some approved way the unit test can set up the context to return the appropriate data source so that the code under test doesnt need to be aware of where its runningp  phr p  pFor Context  MY ORIGINAL QUESTIONp  pI have some Java code that needs to know whether or not it is running under JBoss.  Is there a canonical way for code to tell whether it is running in a containerp  pMy first approach was developed through experimention and consists of getting the initial context and testing that it can look up certain values.  p  precodeprivate boolean isRunningUnderJBossContext ctx          boolean runningUnderJBoss  false         try               The following invokes a naming exception when not running under              JBoss.             ctx.getNameInNamespace               The URL packages must contain the string jboss.

Negative 1962 pI have this old Perl script that is supposed to act as a proxy of sorts between HTTPbased clients and nonHTTP Java server the client POSTs some data to this Perl script and the script would in turn call the Java server, get the response and return it to the client.p  pThe Perl part calls the server like thisp  precodeservervars  DREMOTEHOSTENVREMOTEHOST  a few other server variables passed this way  system java servervars cp varwww javaserver codepre  pand then the Java server would gop  precodeInputStream serverData  System.in serverData.read and read, and read it on .... print response System.out.printContenttype applicationoctetstreamnn System.out.write... codepre  pProblem is, this works just fine when the Perl script is invoked via CGI, but doesnt work at all if the Perl script is handled by modperl modperl2 actually. Apparently the Java part doesnt get the STDIN from Perl serverData.available returns 0 and Perl doesnt get the STDOUT back. The latter can be remedied by doing print codejava...code i.e. backticks instead of system java..., but I dont know what to do about STDIN.p  pThe Perl script itself is able to read the POSTed data in STDIN. Ive also tried to spawn a test Perl script instead of the Java application, and that doesnt get the parent scripts STDIN either.p  pJudging by the description, spawnprocprog from Apache2SubProcess could do the trick i.e. pass the POST data as STDIN to the child process and get back the child process output, but it doesnt seem to work if I run anything but another Perl script.p  pIs there any way to make the child process inherit the parent scripts STDIN I can read the stream in the Perl script and pass its contents as a commandline parameter, but I presume that would be the subject to commandline length limitations, and sometimes there can be a lot of data like an picture, so I would really like to figure out how to inherit the stream.p
Negative 1962 pIve got an old web app written in Classic ASP which used to run on an IIS6 server no problem, then long story short, I moved it onto a Linux server running SunOne ASP which also worked fine after a couple of minor tweaks, and now in a bid to access some 3rd party COM controls the app originally used, Ive moved it back again to a Windows server, this time 2008 running IIS7.  p  pOn the whole the app works fine, but there seems to be a random problem now with the session variables getting lost.

Negative 1962 pIm trying to write a table trigger which queries another table that is outside the schema where the trigger will reside.  Is this possible  It seems like I have no problem querying tables in my schema but I getp  precodeError ORA00942 table or view does not exist codepre  pwhen trying trying to query tables outside my schema.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pMy apologies for not providing as much information as possible the first time around.  I was under the impression this question was more simple.p  pIm trying create a trigger on a table that changes some fields on a newly inserted row based on the existence of some data that may or may not be in a table that is in another schema.p  pThe user account that Im using to create the trigger does have the permissions to run the queries independently.  In fact, Ive had my trigger print the query Im trying to run and was able to run it on its own successfully.  p  pI should also note that Im building the query dynamically by using the EXECUTE IMMEDIATE statement.

The account Im using ME is given privileges to the involved tables via the schema users themselves.  For example USERTABPRIVSp  precodeGRANTOR        GRANTEE TABLESCHEMA    TABLENAME PRIVILEGE GRANTABLE HIERARCHY MAINSCHEMA    ME       MAINSCHEMA    EVENTS     DELETE    NO        NO MAINSCHEMA    ME       MAINSCHEMA    EVENTS     INSERT    NO        NO MAINSCHEMA    ME       MAINSCHEMA    EVENTS     SELECT    NO        NO MAINSCHEMA    ME       MAINSCHEMA    EVENTS     UPDATE    NO        NO OTHERSCHEMAX ME       OTHERSCHEMAX TARGETTBL SELECT    NO          NO codepre  pAnd I have the following system privileges USERSYSPRIVSp  precodeUSERNAME   PRIVILEGE            ADMINOPTION ME         ALTER ANY TRIGGER    NO ME         CREATE ANY TRIGGER   NO ME         UNLIMITED TABLESPACE NO codepre  pAnd this is what I found in the Oracle documentationp  blockquote   pTo create a trigger in another users   schema, or to reference a table in   another schema from a trigger in your   schema, you must have the CREATE ANY   TRIGGER system privilege. With this   privilege, the trigger can be created   in any schema and can be associated   with any users table. In addition,   the user creating the trigger must   also have EXECUTE privilege on the   referenced procedures, functions, or   packages.p blockquote  pHere a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comdocscdB1930601appdev.102b14251adfnstriggers.htm relnofollowOracle Docap  pSo it looks to me like this should work, but Im not sure about the EXECUTE privilege its referring to in the doc.p

Negative 1962 pI have a university project which is already 99 completed. It consists of two partswebsite PHP and desktop Java.p  pPeople have their accounts on the website and they wish to query different information regarding their accounts. They send an SMS which is received by desktop application which queries database of website MySQL and sends the reply accordingly. This part is working superbly. The problem is that some times website wishes to instruct the desktop application to send a specific SMS to a particular number. Apparently there seems no way other than putting all the load to the DB server... This is how I made it work. Website puts SMS jobs in a specific table. Java application polls this table again and again and if it finds a job, it executes it. Even this part is working correctly but strongunfortunately it is not acceptable by my university to poll the DB like thisstrong. p  pThe other approach I could think of is to use clientserver one. I tried making Java server and its PHP client. So that whenever an SMS is to be sent, the website opens a socket connection to desktop application and sends two strings cell  and SMS message. Unfortunately I am unable to do this. I was successfully to make a Java server which works fine when connected by a Java client, similarly my PHP client connects correctly to a PHP server, but when I try to cross them, they start hating each other... strongPHP shows no error but Java gives StreamCorruptedException when it tries to read header of input streamstrong.p  pCould someone please tell what I can try to make PHP client and Java server work together Or if the said purpose can be achieved by another means, howp  pRegards, Yasirp

Negative 1962 pI need to pass an event as a parameter to a function. Is there a way of doing thisp  pThe reason is that I have a sequence of two lines of code that is littered all over my program, where I dynamically remove the handler to an event, and then set the handler again. Im doing this for several different events and event handlers, so Ive decided to write a function that does this.p  pAs an example, lets say I have a combobox in my code called combobox1, and I have the handler called indexChangedHandler. In several places of my code, I have the following two linesp  precodeRemoveHandler combobox1.SelectedIndexChanged, AddressOf indexChangedHandler AddHandler combobox1.SelectedIndexChanged, AddressOf indexChangedHandler codepre  pNow, I dont want to keep on repeating the above two lines of code or similar all over my program, so Im looking for a way to do thisp  precodePrivate Sub setHandlerevt As Event, hndler As eventhandler      RemoveHandler evt, hndler      AddHandler evt, hndler End Sub codepre  pso that everywhere where those two lines of codeor similar occur in my program, I can just replace them withp  precodesetHandlercombobox1.SelectedIndexChanged, AddressOf indexChangedHandler codepre  pSo far, the evt as Event part of the argument of the setHandler function is giving an error.p  pP.S Ive asked this question on a couple of other forums and keep getting asked why I would want to set the handler immediately after removing it. The reason is because dynamically adding an event handler ntimes causes the handler to be executed ntimes when the event occurs. To avoid this, that is, to ensure that the handler is executed just once when the event occurs, I first remove the handler each time I want to add the handler dynamically.p  pYou might be asking why the handler would be added several times in the first place... The reason is because I add the handler only after a particular event, say E1, in my form has occurred I add the handler within the handler of event E1. And event E1 can occur several times within my form. If I do not remove the handler each time before adding it again, the handler gets added and thus executed several times. p  pWhatever the case, the processing occurring within the function is not of ultimate importance to me at this time, but rather just the means of passing an event as a parameter.p

I have obtained the best results from OpenCV function, but still, the accuracy is not sufficient. The results are impaired significantly, when the center is anchored in subpixel regions.  The accuracy I obtained is not sufficient even when dealing with the modeled data, which is bad, as eventually, the procedure will have to deal with the data captured by comeras.

Negative 1962 pWhile creating a Firefox addon, Ive run into a weird problem.br I have an array of nodes, returned by some iterator. Iterator returns only nodes, containing codeNode.TEXTNODEcode as one or more of its children. The script runs on page load.br I have to find some text in that nodes by regexp and surround it with a codeSPANcode tag.  p  precodebeginning skipped   var node  nodeList[i]     var nodehtml  node.innerHTML   var nodecontent  node.textContent   ifnodecontent.length gt 1       var newstr  ltSPAN classbargt  foo  ltSPANgt       var regexp  new RegExp foo , g        nodehtml  nodehtml.replaceregexp, newstr       node.innerHTML  nodehtml    codepre  pBasic version looked like this, and it worked except one issue  codenode.innerHTMLcode could contain attributes, event handlers, that could also contain codefoocode, that should not be surrounded with codeltspangtcode tags.br So I decided to make replacements in text nodes only. But text nodes cant contain a HTML tag, so I had to wrap them with codeltdivgtcode. Like thisp  precodevar node  nodeList[i] forvar j0 jltnode.childNodes.length j     var child  node.childNodes[j]     var childcontent  child.textContent     ifchild.nodeType  Node.TEXTNODE ampamp childcontent.length gt1         var newChild  document.createElementdiv           var newTextNode  document.createTextNodechildcontent           newChild.appendChildnewTextNode         var newhtml  childcontent                     var newstr  ltSPAN classbargt  foo  ltSPANgt         var regexp  new RegExp foo , g          newhtml  newhtml.replaceregexp, newstr         newChild.innerHTML  newhtml         alertnewChild.innerHTML         node.replaceChildnewChild, child       codepre  pIn this case, codealertnewChild.innerHTMLcode shows right html. But after the page is rendered, all codeltdivgtcodes created are empty Im puzzled.br If I uncomment this codep  precode          var newTextNode  document.createTextNodechildcontent             newChild.appendChildnewTextNode   codepre  pcodealertcode also shows things right, and codeltdivgtcodes are filled with text textNode adding works ok , but again without codeltspangtcodes. And another funny thing is that I cant highlight that new codeltdivgtcodes content with a mouse in browser.br Looks like it doesnt take new codeinnerHTMLcode into account, and I cant understand why.br Do I do something wrong I certainly do, but what Or, is that a FF bugfeaturep

Negative 1962 pI have a Facebook iFrame application Id like links in my application to point within my website, so that users can changes pages without having to reload the entire Facebook chrome each time.  However, this raises two issuesp  ol liIf a user opens a link in a new tab, that tab wont have the surrounding Facebook chrome, giving them no way to get back to Facebook.li liIf they press reload, it will reload the outer frame, bringing them back to the first page they navigated to in my application, rather than the one they were currently at.li ol  pFramebusting fixes the first issue but not the second.  What Id like to do is detect whether links are opened in a new tab  window or the current tab  window, and then do thisp  ul liUser clicks on link to codeexample.comaddresscodeli liemIf opened in current tabem  Open codeexample.comaddresscode in the iframe ideally by AJAX loading it, and use Javascript to change the document fragment of the parent frame to codemyappnameaddresscode.li liemIf opened in new tabem Open codeapps.facebook.commyappnameaddresscode in the new tab instead.li ul  pThe document fragment changing is done to solve the reload problem aside from performance reasons, the AJAX loading is done in order to keep track of the parent frames base URL which is necessary in order to set the document fragment correctly we cant read the parent frames URL due to crossdomain restrictions, but we can figure it out when our iframe is initially loaded.p  pIs there any way to achieve this in HTMLJavascriptp  pBefore its suggested, I have considered binding an onclick event to every link, and checking if the Ctrl  Cmd key is pressed down however, this doesnt account for other ways of opening new tabs, e.g. middleclicking, pressing the Enter key when the link is active, or rightclicking and selecting Open in New Tab.p

Negative 1962 pNote This is a followup question to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5676413purevirtualmethodswithdifferentdatatypesthis.ap  pI have a group of template classes that do completely different things in completely different ways using completely different datatypes.  They do, however, share common method names.  For example, codeGetcode, codeSetcode, codeResizecode, etc. are valid methods for each of the classes in question.  Additionally, they accept arguments in the same order.  This allows for generalized nonfriend, nonmember functions to work on each of the classes.

Negative 1962 pRight now Ive got the validation plugin to display labels with one of two background images depending on if the field is valid or not. However, the error text is still inserted in to the not valid labels the valid labels dont have any error messages for them by default.p  pI want to remove the text from displaying on a not valid error label, and place it inside the label as a value for an attribute. This way, I can use the tooltip plugin to display it as a tooltip on mouseover.p  pThe problem is, I dont know how to go about doing this.p  pI know I have to intercept the error messages in the strongmessagesstrong validator option to stop them from appearing.That option can take a function for a given requirement that returns an error string which ill set to . However as far as I know, I dont have access to the error label object from there to insert a message as an attribute . The description for the option states that the function takes the element as the second parameter, but Im not sure if that means the DOM element or the JQuery.val rule elementp  blockquote   pmessagesp      pKeyvalue pairs defining custom   messages. Key is the name of an   element, value the message to display   for that element.Instead of a plain   message another map with specific   messages for each rule can be used.   Overrides the title attribute of an   element or the default message for the   method in that order. Each message   can be a String or a Callback. The   callback is called in the scope of the   validator and with the rules   parameters as the first and the   element as the second arugment, it   must return a String to display as the   message.p blockquote  pI assumed it was the field DOM element and tried to do something likep  precode createAccount is the id for the form  messages                 eMail                     required functionparam,element                        createAccount label[classerror][for  element.getAttributename  ]                        .attrmessage,Required return ,                     email functionparam,element                        createAccount label[classerror][for  element.getAttributename  ]                        .attrmessage,Not valid email return                                  ,             success valid     ...     ... codepre  pBut for some reason its manipulating the strongsuccessstrong validator option, which I use to choose which background image to display. So its marking things valid that it shouldnt.p  pI was just wondering if this was the right way to go about it, or if there is an easier wayp

Negative 1962 pI need to encrypt sections of my web.config file for a client. Most of the references Ive seen are to using aspnetregiis to do the encryption. However, as far as I can see, this needs to happen on the web server which will host the site, which means the encrypted values will be different for each server. I dont have access to this clients servers.

The responses generally dont arrive in the order the requests were sent out. If I could guarantee timely responses, a regular codeMapcode would be enough for that, but there are occasional failures where I also need to resend orphan requests in the order they were added to the queue. So Id use a queue emandem a map, but then I need a way to remove items in the middle of the queue when I get responses that are out of order.p  pIf I cant avoid synchronized thats ok, but it would be nice to use a concurrent data structure too.p  pAny suggestionsp  hr  pemNOTEem The keys have no ordering so an ordered map e.g. a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavase6docsapiindex.htmljavautilconcurrentConcurrentSkipListMap.html relnofollowcodeConcurrentSkipListMapcodea wont help me.p

Negative 1962 pIn several different places in my application, I need to take a codeSeq[SalesRow]code and return a codeMap[String,SalesRow]code, where the string is the name of a country.p  pI need to use this in several places. For example, I take a list of all SalesRows and get a global breakdown of sales by country. But in other places, I want to break down my sales by month and then by country so codeMap[Month,Seq[SalesRow]]code becomes codeMap[Month,Map[String,Seq[SalesRow]]]code  in still other places, I want to break down by day and then by country.p  pMy question is where do I put the small amount of logic that takes a codeSeq[SalesRow]code and returns a map of countries to rows Right now, Im putting it in a companion object method, codeSalesRow.byCountryrows  Seq[SalesReport]code. Is that optimalp  pA slightly crazier idea occurred to me, which is to create an implicit conversion from codeSeq[SalesRow]code to codeEnhancedSalesRowSeqcode, which has a codebyCountrycode instance method. This appeals to me, because the operation is applicable to any sequence of SalesRows.p  pIs this a good ideap  pIs adding the logic to the companion object my best choice, or are there better optionsp  pThanks.p

Negative 1962 pIn my program there are two modes With GUI and without a GUI. when there is a GUI, its imperative that all logging statements be sent to the GUI, otherwise theres really no point. Without a GUI though it doesnt really matter. p  pThe issue is that I expect most 75 of my users to use the program in GUI mode with default settings. The remaining users I expect will want more advanced logging logging to a file, logging to a database, no logging at all, etc. The issue though is that if I cater to the 75, from what I know it will cause pain for the remaining users as my logback.xml file is provided emin my applicationem.p  pThe next option would be to force everyone to download the default logback.xml and put it somewhere in their app. It adds flexability, but its just another piece of the setup. Besides, I think its bad to tell everyone You must put this file in your resources or the GUI wont work. Shouldnt the app provide some default statep  pNote that the last option, setup everything problematically, wont work because other parts of the application might load first. For example some Hibernate code runs first which produces a big wall of debug output in the command line. I also think that the GUI should show everything since the application started, not just from the point the GUI loaded.p  pAny suggestions on what I should dop

Negative 1962 pApple JVM on various OS X version have apparently been broken in that they do not generate the WindowClosing event when they should for example if you close an apps main JFrame using by clicking on the close button.p  piin the most recent Apple Java updates you can set a property forcing the event to be generated but this is not what Im looking forip  pMy problem is simple Id like to display a tip when the user closes the app.  However I cannot due to the fact that no event is generated detected that the user closed the window.p  pSo I thought I could use a shutdown hookp  precodeRuntime.getRuntime.addShutdownHook... codepre  pHowever apparently creating a JFrame from a shutdown hook seems problematic its like if the EDT was already gone once the shutdown hook is called.p  pI tried several things and nothing really seems to makes sense like my Tip JFrame staying all gray despite it working fine when called from anywhere but the shutdown hook or the program exiting immediately.  I tried using a latch and waiting on the latch from the shutdown hook but its as if the EDT wasnt there anymore.p  pIm currently seriously considering spawning a second Java app just to display the tooltip as a workaround but I think its a bit overkill but at least it would work.p  pDid anyone ever try to create a window from a shutdown hook and invoke things on the EDT and are there any gotchas to be aware of remember that I cannot reliably catch the window closing events on OS X due to known verylongstanding Apple VM bugs.p

Negative 1962 pWe are building a system that needs to store yearly versions of some entities. Are there any patterns or best practices on how to design a relational database model with this in mindp  pRight now we are thinking of splitting the tables for the yearly entities into two. One table that stores data that does not change during the years and one table that stores data that may change during the years. Every year we are then going to make a new row in the table with information that may change every year. Then in our code we plan to use a middle layer to merge data from the two tables back into a single object with data from a specific year.p  pLet me give you an example. Lets say we have a business contract of some sort in the database. This particular contract will always exist in the database. It will have its own id and other entities will relate to this contract. Now, every year some details about this contract will change. What I want to do is, once a year save changes to this contract. But I also want to be able to go back in time and see what the contract looked like a specific year. p

Tipically, when I run the program, it will run at around 550 FPS. p  pHowever, if I start a second instance of the program, the FPS drops for both at around half 220 FPS.

Negative 1962 pHas anybody successfully imported the eigen library using the ndk  I was thinking about using it to do all the math matrix operations for an app Im working on. I found a few people mentioning it in some forums but aside from the fact that I dont know if they successfully got it working most of the forums I read start off mentioning some error related to neon code.....which I havent messed with before either. p  pWhat would be really helpful is if some one can point me towards a tutorial on how to compile an existing library like eigen using the ndk. That way I can just do it for myself later on.

Negative 1962 pIm working with SmartGWT  ExtGWT and want to know about implementation of JSON communication between server and client in these frameworks.p  pIn my case data is stored on server side in session. If there is no data in session, server reads it from the specified XML and saves to session.  Fetch client requests data from server in JSON format, server reads data from session and sends it to client in JSON. Update client sends information about update to server in JSON format, server parses it and updates session. Actually I need only implement communication between UI components and server via JSON.p  pWhat I do not understand is how its possible to implement such communication between server and client. I know that clients UI components in SmartGWT and ExtGWT can work with JSON, but have for this quite specific format. But I have no idea how to implement such JSON service on the server side. I think that there are should be some approaches in ExtGWT  SmartGWT, but I couldnt find them. The only way I see is implementing servlets which will generate dynamical JSON responses, and will parse JSON requests. But I think that its not very good idea. Honestly I hope that theres the way that is such trivial as RPC service. Also I hope that there is easier way than implement my own REST service. Now Im reading about AutoBean, but as far as I understand I can use it only for translation to and from JSON format, not for implementation of service.p  pPlease tell me, what is the best way to implement such JSON service in SmartGWT or ExtGWT.p  pstrongUPDstrong I want to emphasise that I need communication between server and UI components. REST or some other services are not required. Therefore I hope that ExtGWT and SmartGWT provides some tools for this I found tools from client side, but nothing from server side. I would appreciate if you tell me what that tools are, or that therere no such tools.p
Negative 1962 pI have a stored procedure that is not only huge, but very memory intensive. This first stored procedure is created for a detail report.  The second stored procedure calls the first stored procedure, places the information into a Temporary table and then selects the information from that temporary table and summarizes it.p  pNow, the second stored procedure doesnt need all of the information in the detail stored procedure, it only needs some of it.  p  pOur DBA has called this approach reckless and has made other suggestions, such as persist this to a real table so that it is run onetime per day.  This actually isnt going to happen because numerous users can run either report numerous times per day and for different date ranges.  His other suggestion was to SUM without the temp table, but Im not sure how you select from one stored procedure only certain fields.p  pI have two questions  How would I follow his second suggestion of SUM without the temp table and if that cant be done, does anyone have any suggestions on the best approach to use to summarize the needed data for the Summary reportp  pBoth of these stored procedures are for separate reports.

Negative 1962 pI had a layout all nicely designed in Qt, but as soon as I clicked on the parent window and set it to a grid layout, things got all wonky. Ive read every tutorial I can find as well as the Qt designer manual and just cannot figure out why this is happening. I have attached a screenshot to show the problem img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRLSE1.png altenter image description herep  pAs you can see, the vertical layout on the left insists on being wider than the children it contains. Both the label and the treeview are set to sizePolicy maximum, and the maximum width is set to 260px. The children themselves stay the correct size, but the vertical layout that contains them doesnt.p  pThe vertical layout in the middle is set to expanding, and the one on the far right is setup the same as the one on the left, only that one appears to work. How do I make the first vertical layout conform to its childrens widthp  pAlso, if I may sneak a second question in, I have a QTextEdit inside the tab widget in the lower right, but it will not fill to take up the space of the full tab view. You cant see that in the screenshot, but if I pull the tabview up, the textedit within it doesnt stretch with it. How do I make it conform to the size of the tab Its already set to sizePolicy expanding, but that doesnt seem to help.p

It acts as a distributed hashmap. The number of buckets in the hashmap is fixed. For each map key, it computes its hashcode, and apply a modulo, so that it knows for each key to each bucket it belongs to.p  pFor exemple, if i have 113 bucket which is the default number of buckets in gemfire, and my map key is the String Keyp  precodeKey.hashCode  113  69 codepre  pThus GemFire knows Key belongs to the 69nth bucket.p  pNow i have a C applicationp  ul liThis application is already aware of the number of buckets used by Gemfire 113.li liThis application needs to be able to compute, for any random key, the bucket number in which GemFire would put that random key.li liThis application needs to be able to compute it fastly, we cant use a webservice.li liThis application should be easy to deploy, and i dont any bridge technology between CJava    that would require a JVM to be installed to run the C applicationli ul  pSo if you know how to do that without having to writeuse a Java hashcode port in C, please tell me.p  pstrongEditstrong to avoid confusion im not looking for a anything else, but Jim Balter you suggested i do not need what i claim to need so tell me if you see any other solution, except using like you said a custom or popular hash algorithm.p  pAnd in the future i may need to do the same for an Erlang partitionning application with a C client application, and other languagesp  hr  pstrongEditstrong I would like to avoid using a nonjava hash algo as someone suggested using md5sha1 or any faster nonsecurityoriented hash algo. This is because my solution aims to be deployed on legacy distributed systems oftenly written in Java, which already contain a lot of data, and any change in the hash algorithm would require a heavy migration process of the data. However i keep this solution in mind since it could be a sweet second option for people starting a new distributed system from scratch or ready to do their data migration.p  hr  pstrongSo in the end, what i am looking for is not some people to tell me to implement the Java String hash algorithm in C, i already know i can do that thanks I want to know if someone already did it, and not only for implementing all primitive java algorithms in C, but also in other languages, and from other languages Im looking for a multilanguages library that provides for each other language, a port of the hash algorithms.strongp  pThus if there would be only 3 languages in earth C, Java and Python, my question is is there any polyglot library that providesp  ul liA port of Java hash in Cli liA port of Java hash in Pythonli liA port of C hash in Javali liA port of C hash in Pythonli liA port of Python hash in Javali liA port of Python hash in Cli ul  pFor all primitive types available, and eventually basic structures.

Negative 1962 pI am using a third party assembly with a bunch of classes, organized in a hierarchical way. They have private constructors and get instantiated by invoking a codeCreateXxxcode method on an instance of another class one level higher. On the top of the hierarchy, a singleton class is used. For example, application code looks something like thisp  precodeTopClass top  TopClass.GetInstance SecondLevelClass secondLevel  top.CreateSecondLevelElement ThirdLevelClass thirdLevel  secondLevel.CreateThirdLevelElement codepre  pSimilarly, finalization is done using a codeDeleteXxxcode method, which has to happen on the same object used for codeCreateXxxcode.p  pI will not go into the reasons why this particular approach was taken. However, I would like to encapsulate the creation for these classes with my own set of classes that do have public constructors, such that the code will look better, like thisp  precode No TopClass anymore, see explanation below MySecondLevelClass secondLevel  new MySecondLevelClass MyThirdLevelClass thirdLevel  new MyThirdLevelClasssecondLevel codepre  pMy initial approach was for the codeMyXxxcode classes to invoke the relevant codeCreateXxxcode method in the constructor and maintain a reference to the result. Also, a reference to the constructor parameter is required in order to invoke the codeDeleteXxxcode method on at finalization time. For that, I was thinking about implementing codeIDisposablecode and invoke codeDeleteXxxcode inside codeDisposecode.p  pWith this approach, the codeTopClasscode has become superfluous for the application developer, because its single purpose was the creation and destruction of SecondLevelClass instances. This now happens under the hood inside the codeMySecondLevelClasscode constructor.p  pAll in all, I think this is technically sound. The only problem I run into is the fact that the original classes implement interfaces that have a lot of methods, which I still want to be exposed via my codeMyXxxcode classes. I am not looking forward to redefining all those methods on my own classes, only to forward all invocations to the encapsulated reference to the instance of the original class . It would be nice if I could do something like overloading the dot operator. Or, it would be nice to tell the compiler that the encapsulated reference to the instance of the original class actually implements the interface  sort of adding an extra indirection in the VMT.p  pThose options are not supported of course, and I have not found a way around this duplication of all methods. Does anybody have an idea of how to do this in a smarter way Any feedback is appreciated, thanks in advance.p

Negative 1962 pI am using phpseclib to ssh to my server and run a python script. Here is phpseclib a hrefhttpphpseclib.sourceforge.net relnofollowhttpphpseclib.sourceforge.neta The thing is, the python script is is made so that you can not end it once you run it. The only way to end it is to end the ssh session. Please dont ask why it is like that, as its a long story... But ctrlc doesnt end it, nothing does except for ending the session. I know that phpseclib is supposed to automatically close the connection after the command is done executing, but technically, my command is never done executing until I end the session, so I need a function in phpseclib that will end the ssh session. I tried using exit and die in my php script, the script just hangs the php script because it thinks it is still executing the command so it doesnt get past that line of code. Terminating the php code via browser or command line does not stop the python script either. It would be great if someone could help. Thanksp
Negative 1962 pIm pulling information from an API, the information is presented as an array of objects, i loop through and pull the information i need, sometimes it involves pulling from several objects for example i might want to pull the username from the users object and then from the activity object how many hours that user has worked.p  pIve coded with php and i can display the information but i want to be able to drill and sort the information so im thinking creating a Mysql temp table, insert all the values and sort them whatever way i like.p  pIs that the best choice, this is a clockin system so i will be the main one running reports so speed isnt really an issue, some of these queries are simple and some a little more complex, but were only talking about 100200 records a day and for the most part ill be only running the queries on 12 months of data only a few thousand records.p  pMy main reason for using SQL is to easily sort by date, from, between, after type thing. Also whats the best way to handle deleting the temp table, i presume deleting it every few day will suffice.p  pAlso one thing im unsure on, lets say most of my reports will be run on the last 60 days, by default i should basically run the report on the last 60 days and when someone filters it within those 60 days it will show me the relevant data from the temp table and basically reuse the information over and over. I could then put in an IF statement that if the from date exceeds 60 days i would need to pull all the information again from the api and do another new temp table or should i just load all the data into mySQL for all time and filter as i want using the same table with 1 large initially queryp  pFWIW retrieving the information from the api is the slowest part seems to be a few secs delay so working directly with the info from SQL should be smoother.p  pIm new to SQL so im not sure of what the best solution is, i could be way off on the approach im taking so im basically looking for the most efficent option that minimizes coding and is newbie friendly. Im coding in php btwp

Negative 1962 pI have a problem with a redirected source of a swf file in chrome and IE only. This is needed for a theme management system that redirects the virtual theme swf modrewrite to the original swf with additional color parameters. The user can select the color with a combobox, for example default, black, gold, orange etc.p  pFor examplep  precodeUser select black in combobox virtual source httpmyservermythemeblack.swf redirects to httpmyservermythemedefault.swfcolor10000ampcolor2ampFFFFFFamp ...... codepre  pThe virtual source is linked to a theme manager called theme.php. This theme manager applies the correct parameters for the default.swf file from a database and redirects it to the default.swf file with applied parameters.p  pFinally, the swf default.swf applies the color query parameters and change some objects to the colors specified.p  pThis is working OK in Firefox and Opera. But in Chrome and IE the query parameters are lost, the swf shows the default colors. I think that this is because the src parameter is still pointing to the virtual file the one without query parametersp  pCan somebody explain to me what is going on or better, does anyone know a solution to this  p

Negative 1962 pIm currently working on a Java web application which will take data submitted by a user from a form and write it to a database. The input page is a JSP file with lots of textboxes, dropdowns, textareas, etc. I would like to know how to go about processing data from the form and putting it into a database when the form could have a variable number of inputs.p  pIll give you an example that illustrates my problem A user has multiple phone numbers that they want to give us. On the form, there is a single input box for phone number, and an add button which uses JQuery to add another phone number input box. When the user submits the form, a servlet receives all the data. At this point, what is the most robust way to process this data so that I can add it to the database My first thought would be to have the javascript increment the name of the phone number box ex phonenumber1, phonenumber2, etc and have the servlet loop through the inputs, but it seems like their should be a more robust way to do it. I would really appreciate any advice I can get. Thanksp  pEdit spellingp

If it doesnt come from the database, so if its a raw input data, escaping is fully needed. But Im using PDO prepareexecute to escape all variables. Questions nowp  ol liIs it OK to use PDOs prepareexecute both in select and insert statements Isnt it escaping variables twice li liLets say I get some variable through PDO exeute statement  is it ok to display this variable simply with POST[variable] without escaping it if it was already done in PDO function li liIs htmlspecialchars enough to escape things such as GET variables which dont come from the databaseli ol  pAnd the most important  is all of this, PDO prepareexecute, and htmlspecialchars, enough to prevent all XSS attacks Or should I also do more If so, what should this be Removing all html tags from the input Using BBCode insteadp

Negative 1962 pI am using embedded C and trying to make application for GPRS terminal. My main problem is working with AT commands. I send AT command using serial line, but if it is some network oriented command its response could take time and because of that I have a lot of waiting, while processor dont do anything. Idea is to make this waiting to be done in same way parallel like in different thread. Does anyone have idea how to do that because my system does not support threads    I had idea to use some timers, because we have interrupt which is called every 5ms, but I dont know ho many seconds I have to wait for response, and if I compare strings in interrupt to check if all message is received it could be very inefficient, rightp

Negative 1962 pIm using codeJTextPanecode in an application for wiki source editing. Ive added a simple spell checking functionality to it which underlines mispelled words by changing character attributes to a different style via codeStyledDocument.setCharacterAttributescode.p  pThere are only these two styles used the default and the mispelled one. The text editor control does word wrapping, which is the expected behavior. p  pMy problem is that there are cases not always, but is reproducible with a specific wiki document this character attribute changing somehow disables the word wrapping. More specifically, I delete three lines from the middle of the document, and the next run of the spell checker, when resets the character attributes to the default style before rerunning the spell checking, the word wrapping functionality gets disabled and it remains that way. If I undo the deletion, the word wrapping goes back to normal.p  pCommenting out the single line that resets the stylep  precodeeditorPane.getStyledDocument.setCharacterAttributes0, editorPane.getStyledDocument.getLength, defaultStyle, true codepre  psolves the issue.p  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pIve extracted the problem to a simple test case.

Negative 1962 pstrongWhat I want to dostrongp  pI would like to implement a gridview where the user can select rows and have the text from cells within the selected row appear on multiple textboxes on the page to be edited. I would also like for an image to be updated depending on the text in the selected row.p  pstrongHow Im doing it nowstrongp  pCurrently, Im using a custom clickable gridview control found a hrefhttpaspadvice.comblogsjotekearchive2006010714576.aspx relnofollow titlehereherea. In essence, the custom control causes a postback on clicking anywhere in the row as well as provides an OnRowClicked event which I can attach an event handling function. Within this function, I save the rowindex in a viewstate and then use code likep  precodeprotected void GridViewClickedobject sender, GridViewRowClickedEventArgs e     TextBox1.Text  System.Net.WebUtility.HtmlDecodee.Row.Cells[0].Text  codepre  pTo fill the text in textboxes and code likep  precodestring filepath  Bitmaps  TextBox1.Text  .bmp     if File.ExistsServer.MapPathfilepath              bitmap.ImageUrl  filepath          else              bitmap.ImageUrl  BitmapsNoImage.bmp      codepre  pTo update the image max size 500kb on my webpage based on the row clicked.p  pstrongSo whats the problemstrongp  pWell, everything is functioning as it should. However, the issue is that each row click has a notable delay between when the mouseclick occurs and when the fieldsimage is updated 0.5s which is quite annoying. However, I dont know what I can do to improve the performance or even if its an issue with the code or with the hosting service. Therefore, what Im asking is whether or not the delay experienced is something that can be fixed or whether its something I just have to deal with Or perhaps I implemented this solution in a really inefficient way Any input is appreciated.p

Negative 1962 pOk, Ive been researching the best way to solve this problem for some time so let me break down my needs and findings for you.p  pNeedsp  ul liAn Activity [SendMsg] composes a message body which may include attachments of images up to 5MB.li liWhen the user sends this message, the message must be uploaded to my server li liThis upload must happen synchronously in the sense that I block the user from using the app until it has completed or failedli liWhen complete, the SendMsg Activity is destroyed if the send was successful  otherwise an error dialog is displayedli liThe upload and user experience must persist given any phone rotation or home button presses  phone calls etcli ul  pThe last bullet here turns out to be the hardest.p  pfindingsp  pI thought about just doing the work in a static AsyncTask but I dont think that works for me  state gets really messy and it seems as though I have no guarantee the OS doesnt kill the thread when the app is in the background.p  pI decided to go with a Service in which it is created and boundunbound from the Activity.  The service spawns an AsyncTask, does the work and then signals the Activity according to its result SUCCEEDFAIL.  This paradigm seems to work fine except for my large messages.  The ServiceActivity communication Message communication is not made for marshalling such large payloads.  NOTE if it is not clear, when the user hits send, this form data and file must be made available to the Service.  In some cases this is an image taken from the camera which DOES not and CAN not exist on disk for purposes of the app.p  pClearly what I want here is some sort of shared memory store where I can save the data from the Activity.  Then the Activity can signal the Service that it can go ahead and upload that data.  p  pCan such a shared area exists in memory  Can I get the Application object from a Service and store the data therep  pThe other problem comes about when the upload finishes but no Activity is bound to the Service but I think I may have figured this one out.  Please let me know if the following makes sensep  ol liService finishes uploadli liService checks to see if an Activity is currently boundli liIf yes, return error Message which Activity handles via its Message queueli liIf no, store the return code in that shared memory area and flag a boolean there as wellli liWhen a client Activity is created  resumed, it should first always check this boolean to see if the process is already complete.  If so, dispatch a Message it its own handler and handle the code as beforeli ol

Negative 1962 pIm quite new in Apache so please be patient.  Im trying to write distributed application which uses WebSocket protocol to communicate with each node.  What is important it must work in client  sever architecture. It means that client for example web browser connects to single node and makes some requests. This requests can be distributed between other nodes using webSocket protocol and after computing send back to client.  As a servers I must use Apache with modpywebsocket.  If any node, for some reason, lose connection this situation should be detected by rest of nodes. Whats more, after reconnect this node should be able to send some kind of ping to other servers, to let them know that he is now available. p  pNow I have one client and two servers. Im able to connect to one of them, which then makes connection to the second one, downloads some data and sends them back to client. All of this is done by using pywebsocket handlers and some modifications of echoclient.py from pywebsocket examples.  What I want to do is to make permanent connections between all servers and check their availability by sending WebSocket pingpong frames between them. If one of Apaches disconnects this should be detected very easy by using this.  The problem is that I have no idea how to force Apache to connect to other servers on startup using WebSocket. This should be some kind of module which starts after Apache reboot and which connects to all addresses from  for example  configuration file. When the connection is established it should start sending pingpong frames to other servers to let them know that he is available. p  pMy question is if there is any way to force Apache to make this kind of connection on startup to many servers  I hope my explanation is clear enough.

FROM zencustomersbasket, zenproducts WHERE zencustomersbasket.productsid  zenproducts.productsid             AND zenproducts.productsavailability  out of stock codepre  pI then check all the records and then delete them. Its fairly quick and painless, but I need a query that will automatically delete these records so I can automate it with some other queries that are scheduled to run once per hour. Any and all help would be appreciated. I know how to delete records but Im not sure of the proper syntax here since Im selecting things from two different tables and I dont want to screw anything up.p
Negative 1962 pIm trying to debug an issue on a clients machine.  The problem is that the problem is a runtime error with very little clue as to where it is.  It is an intermittent problem.  I know ADL allows me to run the application in a debug mode.  The problem is that to tell the user to download and manage the ADL invokation is going to be very difficult.  It would be a lot easier if I could just give the end user one installexecutable to install and run and then send me the trace of the issue.  So what Im looking for is easy steps for the client to be able to run the AIR app in debug mode.  Downloading ADL and finding the install location of the app is going to be difficult to manage remotely with the end user.p  pUpdate You have to make sure you are working with AIR 3.5 and Flash 11.5 and also include the following flag swfversion18 in additional compiler settings.  You then have to catch the global error as mentioned in the answer and it will show you the location of the error.  No line numbers of course. Just routine names.  Thanks a milion to Lee for the awsome answer. p

Negative 1962 pId like to create a small overlay view that would float on top of all the others. I need the view to accept touches and I need it to stay in place even during transitions between the underlying views. What I have tried so farp  ol lipStandalone view inserted into the key codeUIWindowcode. The obvious downside is that the view is not attached to any view controller, which means handling at least rotation events by hand.pli lipcodeUIViewControllercode containment, have a root view controller that would contain the floating view and all navigation would be done underneath it. This is very much a firstclasscitizen solution, but presenting a modal view controller overlaps the floating view.pli lipSecond codeUIWindowcode with a root view controller containing the floating view. This goes against Apple recommendations and I had some trouble filtering which events should go to which window.pli ol  pDoes anyone have a working solution that doesnt require too much brittle hackingp

Negative 1962 pstrongGoalstrong What I need is to display a SQL DataTable to the user on a webpage through ASP.NET and allow them to select a number of rows very quickly and easily, and then hit any of a number of different buttons to signify different operations. The selected rows are to be sent off to be processed generally sent to a webservice or similar through codebehind. This is a somewhat generic solution, as I will be using this same setup in many places  thus the data, and the available operations will be different.p  pThe goal is to be able to know basically nothing about the data  that is for the user to understand. If this concept is already impossible though I believe it is not, please let me know.p  pPulling from TSQL SQL Server 2008 R2 or later. Using ASP.NET to make aspx webpage. Codebehind is done in VB.NET, in both cases were using 4.0 Im fluent in C and VC, so if you cant easily translate your code, dont worry about that.p  pstrongThe problemstrong My problem has been creating a row selection process for the user which persists while sorting or paging the table, is quick for the user and relatively quick in response time, and which is reflected in the GridViews bound data as this allows me to use a filter on a DataView to produce a DataTable for passing. If theres another way to know the selected rows then Im all game so long as it is persistant and quick for the user.p  pIm not debugging and Im not having syntax issues I do not believe  I dont know how to proceed. I dont necessarily need code as a solution  I need to understand if my metaphor is either bad practice, or simply uncommon and thus not well supported. In either case, what is an appropriate way to proceed If nothing else, where do I look for a solution besides endless API and Tutorialsp  pstrongMy original planstrong I wanted to use aspGridView for binding the DataTable pulled from TSQL since I can autogenerate columns. This allows me to display data without needing to know what it is. I planned to add a specific boolean Column left most for storing the Users row selection. Then I can simply run a filter on the DataTable to produce a DataView, get the resulting DataTable from that DataView, and pass it down the chain. p  pAll the columns except our specific selection one would be ReadOnly. The user isnt editing data  their selecting records and view their selection sidebyside with the viewable relevant data.p  pOf note, I planned to check for name collision so our added Column doesnt collide with any existing Column in the DataTable  Id rename it as needed using Select followed by an integer produced by looping through, comparing my name to other columns, incrementing as needed. p  pI presumed that once I set this up, it would just handle itself the user could click the resulting checkbox column cells and it would change the data on the fly. The point of saving the selection was their selection persisted through sorting and paging for convenience I save the GridViews DataSource and rebind when necessary. It didnt really matter if the user refreshed the page and completely and lost their checkboxes  they would need to review any changesnew data, and they wouldnt need more then a brief moment to check off whatever they wanted. p  pThis did not happen.p  pI found that AutoGenerateColumns does not produce checkboxes for boolean DataColumns. It produces text, so I end up with the word True or False.p  pI began looking for a way to get check boxes in the cells for a boolean DataColumn. I found that for the added boolean column, I could bind an aspCheckBoxField to it using the attribute DataField. Of course, I have to figure out how to point it at a variable DataField...p  precodeltColumnsgt   ltaspCheckBoxField DataFieldSelect HeaderTextSelect     ReadOnlyFalse SortExpressionSelectgt     ltItemStyle HorizontalAlignCenter gt   ltaspCheckBoxFieldgt ltColumnsgt codepre  pHowever, because a GridView is designed for RowByRow editing, all the resulting CheckBoxes are disabled and cannot be checked. This is because their containing row is not in Edit Mdoe. I do not want to enable RowByRow editing using a button or similar metaphor as the user often needs to check off several rows. More clicks is bad, and annoying. They should be focused soley on their data and making their selection, not worrying about remembering to enter and end edit mode. Also, the metaphor seems poorly placed here since the checkboxes are the ONLY editable data  and are not part of the represented data.p  pI could, of course, make a new class which inherits from GridView, overload the method which generates columns to produce checkboxes instead of text fields  but I felt there had to be a more straightforward path. Maybe this is the way to go But maybe it would have the same editing issue as above  Im not sure.p  pSo, next I tried looking at using an aspTemplateField as a column in my GridView. This TemplateField contains an aspCheckBox whos Checked state is based on the underlying bound data value. The issue here is trying to make changing the checkstate update that bound value. I would need some way of looking up a GridView value I could then use to find the same row in the DataTable. Ive seen great examples using a Primary Key. While I could assume everyone keeps a Primary Key for any possible table, this might not be the case I could further add a Primary Key myself, but now it looks like I would be adding and removing two columns before I pass a DataTable off to a WebService instead of just one. Again, I also would need to be able to assign a Column name which is dynamic to avoid collision.p  precodeltaspTemplateField HeaderTextSelectgt     ltItemTemplategt       ltaspCheckBox runatserver IDCheckBox         Checkedlt DataBinder.EvalContainer.DataItem, Select gt         AutoPostBacktrue OnCheckedChangedSelectCheckBoxCheckChanged gt       ltItemTemplategt ltaspTemplateFieldgt codepre  pI stopped myself  This path is also fairly indirect. Surely there is a much cleaner, simpler way to do this. Is it uncommon for someone to display ReadOnly data where records are selected to be submitted, in one fashion or another, for processingupdatingalterationp  pIs my choice of GridView poor I havent yet found another good way to represent Table data.p

Is there a way for me to use their UDID and generate an .ipa file to send them to test on their device via email, without them having to physically provide me with their actual device  I have heard of TestFlight as a possible solution, but can it be used for a device that is located in another part of the world, and I simply have the UDID to work with  Please bear in mind that the people whom I wish to have test my app are NOT iOS developers, and are therefore NOT registered with Apples Developer program.

Negative 1962 pIm looking reproducibility between android system AOSP daily builds against repos collections of git repositories and the impact of using fastforward merges.p  pThe problem is that when doing daily builds you will get a tipoftree while development is happening elsewhere.  If HEAD hasnt changed when the change is pushed, it will do a fastforward merge and time will be rewritten.  So effectively the physical state of the repository 3 days ago will be different than asking git to go back three days.p  pThe prime solution I can see is to use git with noff to force merge commits. This injects a lot of noise for smaller commits, and seems to be considered bad practice in keeping a clean tree.   p  pThe background on this is trying to have reproducibility in an android build environment.  For those that dont know, an android build is a collection of disparate git repositories.  My ultimate use case is that I want to be able to say, put the code base in the state it was for developers 3 days ago.  With fastforward merges, we lose some critical information on how to correlate between changes on multiple repo projects ie git repositories.p

Negative 1962 pSometimes we find our self in situation where we have to choose one from database size or performance.p  pI am working on application for bill accounting in which i store details of bill in table design p  precode BillNo ProductName  Qty Rate  1       aaaa        1   12 codepre  pI learned that its not good to store data we can calculate at run time in database like codeAmountQtyRatecode code, TaxAmount5100code.p  pBut at some point i need Total amount and total vat for thousands of entries, if i follow above approach first i need to select  codeQty , Ratecode then perform multiplication for each row then perform addition which will be definitely time consuming.p  pWhat i was thinking  Move on with approach which stores data like p  precode BillNo ProductName  Qty Rate  Tax   Amount  1       aaaa        1   12     4      16 codepre  pstrongDisadvantagestrongp  ol liNeed to store extra data in database and which will increase some performance overhead also for insertion of Tax and Amount.li ol  pstrongAdvantagestrongp  ol liNeed to select only one value from database.li liNo need to perform multiplication operation, which will improve my performance. li ol  pWhich one is better and efficient in condition like this .p  pAbove question is just an example to explain the condition. Mainly question is about whether i go with computed columns or calculation during retrieval. As Calculation during retrieval is good if you dont have large no of records but it is against database rules. Is choice between computed columns or calculation during retrieval depend upon no of records.p

This UIView is a subview of the main view controllers view.p  pA lot of the answers on StackOverflow point to making a transparent UIButton covering the whole view controller and adding the UIView on top of that and detecting when the UIButton was tapped.p  pTo me that seems a little hacky, but I might be wrong. Im afraid that in a future release Apple may make it so you cant interact with transparent objects or something, and it will break the solution. p  pIs this really the best solution Or is there another way to do it that would be more cleanp

Negative 1962 pI am using this a hrefhttpsgithub.comcardinalbluerestmore relnofollowrestmorea repository, which contains many implementations of the webapi such as Facebook or Linkedin. I forked that repository, and in my branch I added my own implementation of another web api.p  pHowever now I find that it is pretty hard to keep updated with the original repository.

Only one commit is touching a file from the original repository.p  pIs there an easy way to move my commits into a new repository I want to do this so I can preserve my commit histories.p

Negative 1962 pI am using jQuery Dialog to load other pages into a dialog on the main page.  The other pages may have anchor tags, and I am using the completed event of the load function to select all of the anchor tags in the div into which the content was loaded.  I then  wire up the anchor tags click event handler so that the content is loaded into the div which is contained on the main page.  This works, however only twice.  When you run the sample code below, Partial1 appears in the dialog.  When I click on the Partial2 link in the dialog, Partial1 is loaded into the dialog, however, this time when I click on the Partial2 link, it loads in the main page.

Negative 1962 pI want to write a wrapper around codefstreamcode class. As I can see the most common way to check if stream works well is to see result of codegoodcode function. However, Ive heard that this is mostly historical function and it is not really safe to use it to be more correct, there may be some situations when stream doesnt work well but function returns codetruecode. So Id like to share experience and to know from others what is the most correct way to check codefstreamcode for errors.p  pIt would be great if there could be a possibility to check different types of errors like if file doesnt exist, can be opened only for reading, etc. It is also necessary to leave such programs to be crossplatform however, the main target is Linux.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1962 pI have a UITableView that sometimes has rapid insertions of new rows.  The insertion of the new rows is handled by a notification observer listening for the update notification fired whenever the underlying data changes.  I use a synchronized block around all the data model changes and the actual notification post itself... hoping that each incremental data change and row insertion will be handled separately.  However, there are times when this still fails.  The exception will tell me that it expects 10 rows based on the count from the data model, it previously had 8 rows, but the update notification only told it to insert a single row as this is the first of two rapidly fired notifications.  p  pIm trying to understand how other people tend to handle these types of situations.

Negative 1962 pI have an array of values set up likep  precodearray[0][Year, Value] codepre  pWhere there are 100 or so arrays inside of the main array, each with 30 value pairs of Year and Value.

So, the new array need to be [1900, array[0][Value]], null] to indicate that the array[1] doesnt have a value there, but is still a series on the graph.  Then [1901, array[0][Value], array[1][Value]], etc etc.p  pIve been drawing out diagrams and trying to wrap my head around creating a series of loops to take my old array and convert it... but Im at a loss.

Negative 1962 pI have 2 SQL queries that I need to combine into one due to the sheer size of the database most of the retail store locations, it is fine, but some have much much more transactionsp  pBasically, I need the number of transactions per employee for a given day. To do this, I am counting the distinct number of transaction numbers per employee each item in a transaction gets its own row with the same transaction number, thus it needs to be distinct. However, there is a column txnvoidmod. Basically the goal is that if the value of this column is 0, I simply count the transactions normally, but if the value is 1, I need to subtract off one because the transaction was actually voided. p  pHere is some sample datap  precode  transnum txnvoidmod  salesprsnid    115568  0           1339          115568  0           1339          114566  0           1339          114566  0           1339          115504  0           2555          105551  0           0452          105551  0           0452          105551  0           0452          105552  1           0452          105552  1           0452          105552  1           0452          codepre  pI am omitting some fields that are unnecessary for this example.p  pHere is the query that I am usingp  precode select txnpostransactions.cashiernum as salesprsnid,      countdistinct MS.transnumas transcnt     from TxnMerchandiseSale MS       INNER JOIN txnpostransactions ON MS.transnumtxnpostransactions.transnum      Where MS.modtime like 20130601  AND MS.itemdatetime like 20130601       and txnvoidmod0 or txnvoidmod1      Group by txnpostransactions.cashiernum order by salesprsnid codepre  pI am leaving out the fact that this query also is querying for netsales and units sold, so I must take that into account.

Negative 1962 pI am trying to get my FTP site to use an SQL database table for authentication.  I found this a hrefhttptechblog.edwardting.com20100721creatingacustomdatabasedrivenauthenticationforaniis7ftpsiteusingvisualstudioc relnofollowguidea.  And followed it almost to the letter, except I am using IIS 8 and Visual Studio 2010.  Now because the GAC is no longer put in CWindowsassembly I found my .dll in the new location CWindowsMicrosoft.NETassemblyGACMSIL.  After a lot of research I managed to find the properties for this the Culture, Version, and Public Key Token that are required.  I added this as a custom provider.  Now it seems like everything is in place like it should be but when I log onto the ftp site it fails to log in withp  precodeResponse   530 User cannot log in. Error  Critical error Error  Could not connect to server codepre  pI have been doing some trouble shooting and it doesnt look like the .dll is even being referenced.  I set it to always return true so that it would grant anyone with any password access, and received the same error.  I have been looking all over the place but all I can find is stuff about IIS 7 and things where the GAC is located in the old location. The FTP site was working fine, I was able to connect to it, with the basic authentication that is build in to IIS so I am pretty sure the site isnt the problem. p  pSo my question is where do I go from here  Is IIS 8 not looking in the new GAC location for my .dll  Is this why it seems like the code isnt being run at all  Or am I missing something that is obvious that will make me feel like an idiot when it gets answeredp  pI am stuck so even pointing me in a new direction would be helpful at this point.p

Negative 1962 pThe code below is SUPPOSED to do this Wherever current athlete is, when you tap a next button the code below is executed.

Negative 1962 pI know it sounds like something thats been asked before, but for all my hunting, I cant find anything matching what Im looking for.p  pIm working on a project thats rather heavily based on Ajax. Im using jQuery, but even with its beautifully streamlined code, its still messy when Ive got it to the point that the code is exactly the same, except for one single command passed through the codedatacode field.p  pSo I tried setting it up inside a handler function, like sop  precodefunction calltask, opts, async      iftypeof async  boolean  async  true      opts  .extend, opts, options     .ajax         url myphpfile.php,         dataTypeJSON,         typePOST,         asyncasync,         data  task task, opts opts      .donefunctiondata  return data   codepre  blockquote   pemFor those who read through, youll notice that theres a var,em   codeoptionscodeem, that hasnt been defined in the example. It has actually   been assigned, its just been omitted for clarity purposes.emp blockquote  pI came to realize that this doesnt work, as even when its set to codeasync falsecode, the code still continues after the call of codecall...code, therefore not getting the results in time. Ive tried a few different variations, including passing an anonymous function to the handler and then using that as the code.donecode function, but it wouldnt interact with outside variables, defeating the purpose.p  pAll Im looking for is a system that will let me use it something like thisp  precodevar returnedData  callthisismytask var returnedDataWithOptions  callthisisanothertask, option option1 codepre  pI really hope this is possible. Im sure it would be, as the main purpose of functions is to remove the need for unnecessarily repeated code. p  pThanks. p
Negative 1962 pWhile searching for an answer to this question, Ive run into similar ones utilizing LINQ but I havent been able to fully understand them and thus, implement them, as Im not familiarized with it. What I would like to, basically, is thisp  ol liCheck if any element of a list contains a specific string.li liIf it does, get that element.li ol  pI honestly dont know how I would go about doing that. What I can come up with is this not working, of coursep  precodeif myList.ContainsmyString     string element  myList.ElementAtmyList.IndexOfmyString codepre  pI know WHY it does not workp  ul licodemyList.Containscode does not return codetruecode, since it will check for if a whole element of the list matches the string I specified.li licodemyList.IndexOfcode will not find an occurrence, since, as it is the case again, it will check for an element matching the string.li ul  pStill, I have no clue how to solve this problem, but I figure Ill have to use LINQ as suggested in similar questions to mine. That being said, if thats the case here, Id like for the answerer to explain to me the use of LINQ in their example as I said, I havent bothered with it in my time with C. Thank you in advance guys and gals.p  pEDIT I have come up with a solution just loop through the list, check if current element contains the string and then set a string equal to the current element. Im wondering, though, is there a more efficient way than thisp  precodestring myString  bla string element    for int i  0 i lt myList.Count i      if myList[i].ContainsmyString         element  myList[i]  codepre

Negative 1962 pWe are developing a search application. All of the stuff is done, like SOLR schema, search queries, faceted search etc. I tried to develop a cxf web service that returns a list of SolrDocument. Everything is OK until I try to make the return type of the service function as SolrDocument. I know that CXF does not generate return types for java objects that does not have an empty constructor. For SolrDocument object is this the case Besides, I succeeded to return complex java object types with CXF. For returning SolrDocument as an object what is your proposed solutions p  pAn idea that came to my mind was to create my own Document object and convert SolrDocument to that type but it is expensive since I already have the search results as SolrDocument.p  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 1962 pI am an elementary school teacher currently working with a developer through Elance on a reading log app for iPhoneiPodiPad. The app allows for multiple users to create individual profilesreading logs. Users will then access their logs via a Students page which lists all users and then by entering a password. To avoid the need for each student to log out after each logging session some elementary students might forget to log out and then another student could unintentionally record her reading activity on the previous users log. we have it coded so that the app closes when the home button is pressed. However, this setup is not ideal, and gets a little frustrating when multitasking. One solution, after closing the app with the home button, would be to have it reopen displaying the Students page. I have 2 questionsp  ol lipIs possible to close an app from one page and have it reopen on a different page within the apppli lipAre there any other solutions to this problempli ol

Negative 1962 pI am wondering if you can run Ant on a buildfile that would be located inside a JAR.  The reason why I am interested in this is because I would like to include a deploy target in my buildfile that could be called after the jar has been moved to its destination.  That deploy target would take care of extracting resources and other libraries required to run the program.p  pSo, for instance, I would package up properties, images and external jars inside of my jar when building.  The deployment process would then consist of moving the jar to the location it is meant to run in, and call codeant ltsomeOptiongt myjar.jarbuild.xml deploycode or something like that.p  pDoes that make sensep

Negative 1962 pI have a questionchallenge for the community. p  pI am working with [several] databases that are new to me, and thoroughly undocumented. As I explore and learn them, each time I look at a new table I have to start poking and prodding it to determine what each record is telling me, more specifically which fields actually make up a unique record. p  pOne of these databases is created by a process designed by my predecessors which involves loading a series of csv files to individual tables. No care was taken to do any form of validation or indexing, and all fields are brought in as nvarchar50, so I really have no clues via table structure as to what should be treated as a primary key. In almost every case, there is no one column in which I can count distinct values and have that equal the number of records, so what makes up a record is a combination of two or more fields. p  pMy questionchallenge is this Can someone get me started as to a procedure, algorithm, or even manual process that would test the possible combinations of fields for uniqueness, and report back the possible field combinations using the fewest number of fields that result in a set of unique records. p  pManually, I have just been cross joining a table to itself on every field, then commenting out fields. By comparing countem on the cross join with countem on the original table, I can know that my selected fields for joining are making unique records, but this requires a lot of typing, and my personal time to test combinations. Im hoping to figure out a way to machineautomate the process, and throw back possibilities that I may not have even caught doing it manually. The fact is, when all Ive got to go on is the data in the table, there are probably a bunch of possible answers using the fewest possible number fields. p  pI have hundreds of tables with widely varying sizes in both row count and number of fields. Most of them are modestly few columns lt20ish fields.p  pIdeas anyone Open to any approach. p

Negative 1962 pI need to import files that were created with SQL Server 2005 into R. I need R to read the current format or else I need a method for my data provider so that my colleague can save in a format that R can read, with csv being the first choice.p  pA colleague is sending me quite a few large files that have been saved with MS SQL Server 2005 on a server. I am using R 2.15.1 on Windows 7.p  pUsing R I am trying to read in the files using standard techniques. Although each file has a csv extension, when I go to Excel or WordPad and do SAVE AS I see that it is Unicode Text. Notepad indicates that the encoding is Unicode.

Negative 1962 pHere is my problem p  pA student has decided to celebrate the start of Thanksgiving  break a tad early by getting a bit smashed.p  pHer home is at corner 0 on Main Street, and the Jail is at corner 10 on Main  Street. The student starts at corner 5, and wanders one corner to the left or to  the right with probability 0.5 for each she repeats the process until arriving  safely at home or landing in jail. That is, at each corner, the drunk student has  a 5050 probability of staggering left or right, to the next highernumbered or  next lowernumbered corner.p  pWrite a method named drunkWalk using a while or a dowhile loop that  simulates the drunk students walk your method should return with a single  integer that both indicates how many steps were taken and whether the  student landed in jail or at home. You can do this if you return the number of  steps taken as a negative number if the person lands in jail, and as a positive  number if the person ends up at home. You should not print out each step taken  in your nal version of the method, though you might want to do this while  you are debugging.p  pOnce you have your method working, have your main program call upon  your drunkWalk method N times where N is a nal variable. Finally, have  it calculate and print the average number of steps that the student took for one  trip.

Negative 1962 pso this is my first time posting a question here so please bear with me. I am studying computer science for my bachelors, and I would like some help. We have created various Classes that are all part of a Roster Management System. I have all the classes set up and such, and I can figure out how to store everything in a dynamically allocated array later on, for the time being I am having a difficult time just reading the data needed from a file. p  pThe format for the text file is as followsp  precodecourse1name  course1code  numbercredits  professorname student1 first name  student1 last namecreditsgpammddyyyymmddyyyy student2 first name  student2 last namecreditsgpammddyyyymmddyyyy endroster course2name  course2code  numbercredits  professorname student1 first name  student1 last namecreditsgpammddyyyymmddyyyy endroster codepre  pAs you can see, the rosters only have four data fields, course name, course code, number of credits and the professors name. p  pStudents have 6 fields, 7 if you include the endroster marker the endroster marker is literally just that, not a bool value or anything. p  pAnyway, I cant seem to figure out how to read this input properly. I can read it all in and tokenize it, but then I dont know how to append each section to its correct class. This happens to give me each token not 100 clear what that is, but it seems to append each set of characters into a string. I do not know how to assign it into their proper places from this point forward though.p  precodeifstream myrosterrosters.txt while  myroster.eof       getlinemyroster, line     cout ltlt line ltlt endl ltlt endl     char c[line.length  1]     strcpy c,  line.cstr     char  p  strtokc,      while p  0              cout ltlt p ltlt endl         p  strtokNULL,          counter       myroster.close codepre  pIve also tried the followingp  precodeifstream myrosterrosters.txt while myroster.eof      getlinemyroster, line,      counter  codepre  pBoth methods had some form of counter implementation my first attempt. For example if counter  4 itll be appended to roster, or counter  6 and its students, but nothing worked I realized the flaw later onp  pThe reason I dont just hardcode the program to implement line one for roster1 information, line 2 for student 1, line 3 for student 2, and etc is because the data needs to be edited in the program, and one of the options is to add studentsremove them and add rostersremove them, after which the file needs to be updated again, and then read in again after.p  pCan anyone shed some light on thisp

Negative 1962 pI recently started playing around with the SharpDX wrapper to get high performance graphics output from a C application. According to its creators, the performance penalty associated with using SharpDX their own numbers indicate that going via SharpDX is about 2X slower than interfacing with DirectX from native code is emmainlyem stemming from the marshalling of draw calls from managed code to the underlying API.p  pTherefore I wonder if it would be a good idea to create some sort of batching of those calls in a lightweight description language to cut down the number of marshalleded calls per screen update to one. Im thinking about an approach where Im translating the calls into a bytearrayish table that could be sent in one go to a C method that in turn would decode that into appropriate native D2D calls.p  pFor examplep  pMy custom layout system in C would collect everything that is supposed to be rendered for the next screen update in a list,  la so quasi descriptionp  precode 1. define brush1colorFF, 00, 00  2. define brush2color00, FF, 00  3. draw ellipsebrush1, origin0, 0, radius15, 15  4. draw ellipsebrush2, origin127, 127, radius255, 255  5. draw ellipsebrush2, origin127, 0, radius255, 255  6. ... codepre  pThis list could then be encoded as a byte array for simplicity, coordinates are given as bytes in this rough examplep  precode1. 01 01 FF 00 00 2. 01 02 00 FF 00 3. 10 01 00 00 0F 0F 4. 10 02 7F 7F FF FF 5. 10 02 7F 00 FF FF 6. ... codepre  pThen at codeRendercode this sequence is sent to a custom C method all at once i.e. with just one marshalled call, rather than hundreds, maybe thousands which parses this and does the corresponding, actual calls to the Direct2D API natively.p  pIs such an approach viablep

Negative 1962 pI am working in nodejs with express for a web app that communicates with mongodb frequently. Currently I running production with my own job queue system that only begins processing a job once the previous job has been completed an approach that seems to be taken by a hrefhttpsgithub.comlearnboostkue relnofollowkuea.p  pTo me, this seems wildly inefficient, I was hoping for a more asynchronous job queue, so I am looking for some advice as to how other nodejs developers queue their jobs and structure their processing.p  pOne of my ideas is to process any jobs that are received immediately and return the resulting data in the order of addition. p  pAlso to be considered currently each user has their own independent job queue instance, is this normal practice Is there any reason why this should not be the case ie, all users send jobs to one universal queuep  pAny commentsadvice are appreciated. p

Should I just use a bunch of rows of textboxes But then if the user runs out of rows, Im screwed.

Negative 1962 pIm starting a new project and also trying to get a better understanding of OOP in PHP. What I really want to see in action is the pros and cons of emencapsulationem. My ideal goal is to see there is no emclasspropertyem exposed to the global scope, so there should be only emmethodsem publicly available to others, and they will rely on emprivateem or emprotectedem classproperties.p  pThe other thing that Im really looking into is to have a good eminheritanceem as well However Im facing difficultly on how to combine both at the same design  probably I have a wrong understanding or too much expectations from inheritance. To picture it better imaging the following structurep  ol liClass codeAppcode is the base class.li liI have a couple of other classes like codeStoragecode class also, which they all emextendsem codeAppcode class.li liUnderneath, I have a MVC structure as well. So I want to have access to codeStoragecode methods just inside of my codeModelcode class, ideally by getting use of eminheritanceem not emdependency injectionem for example.li ol  pNow if I want to have my codeStoragecode methods available to others, I can simply make a public property in the codeAppcode class and store the codeStoragecode instance in there, so every other class can simply access all the codeStoragecode methods, but I want to avoid it and implement a true encapsulation and see how it works in the real world.p  pOn the other hand I want to have a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSingleresponsibilityprinciple relnofollowSRPa on board as well. If I implement even just a single method in the codeAppcode class that somehow gives you access to the codeStoragecode class for example, then Im violating SRP, because thats not the business of codeAppcode class  codeAppcode cant see the child methods, so I need to provide a way of accessing it. p  pAlso in the above case, whenever I extend the codeAppcode in another class, then I have to come back to the codeAppcode class and provide some form interface to that class as well. That means touching an alreadyworking code and I think its not a good practice at all unless you want to debug the code, but not for adding features or even worst when youre extending that class by others.p  pSo the question is can I implement such a design without any compromise, and ideally in a battletested structurep

Negative 1962 pBasically I have a script that allows members to register, passwords currently must contain at least 1 lowercase, 1 uppercase, 1 numeric and 1 special character, the password must also be at least 8 characters in length.p  pOn the registration and password change pages I want to suggest 3 randomly generated strong passwords but not sure if my methods are the best way of doing it.p  pbasically i run substrstrshuffle against 4 set of characters, the first is lower case, the second is upper case, the third is numeric and the fourth is special characters.p  pCertain lettersnumbers have been ommitted such as zero and O to avoid confusion between the 2. I have also repeated each character to allow for the option of each character to be included more than once.p  pI then do a final substrstrshuffle on the output of the first 4 results to generate a password that is 10 characters in length and contains at least 2 of each of lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special characters.p  precode Generates a secure random password randomLC  substrstrshuffleabcdefghjkmnpqrstuvwxyzabcdefghjkmnpqrstuvwxyz, 0, 2 randomUC  substrstrshuffleABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ, 0, 2 randomNC  substrstrshuffle2345678923456789, 0, 2 randomSC  substrstrshuffle[]ampltgt[]ampltgt, 0, 4  randomPW  substrstrshufflerandomLCrandomUCrandomNCrandomSC, 0, 10 randomPW2  substrstrshufflerandomLCrandomUCrandomNCrandomSC, 0, 10 randomPW3  substrstrshufflerandomLCrandomUCrandomNCrandomSC, 0, 10 codepre  pThe output could then be echoed through randomPW, randomPW2 etc.p  pA current example of what the above code outputs isp  precodevH[2pW2amp 5wM6qP qM5w6P PM65wq codepre  pI believe that if i simply did 1 substrstrshuffle against all the characters there is a good chance that it would not meet the requirements of at least 1 of each character type being included in the output.p  pIs there an easier way to produce a random password that meets the above requirementsp

Negative 1962 pI have done quite some researches on the topic, most answers I got is that cookie will NOT work on localhost since cookie expects the domain to contain at least 2 dots. But my question is, since ASP.NET WebSecurity class is able to set the authentication cookie from the server side, and javascript is able to set the cookie on client side when I am using localhost as domain. So there must be a way to do it, I would like to know how could it be done from the server side. p  pUpdate Currently I am trying to do it with Java server. p  precodeCookie tokenCookie  new CookieToken, token  will work if I include this line and use 127.0.0.1 to access my page userNameCookie.setDomain127.0.0.1  tokenCookie.setPath response.addCookietokenCookie return Response.ok.build codepre  pstrongI have no idea why there are two people trying to close this question as a duplicate.

Now, when I inject the codeFTPConnectionFactorycode into an EJB, I sometimes get an InjectionException as WELD tries to inject the codeSFTPConnectionFactorycode instead this is of course consistent during a run of the appserver I either consistently get the right or the wrong one.

Negative 1962 pIm fairly inexperienced in PoSh, however I think I can hold my own on the noob circuit.  Im trying to work on a mechanism to retrieve direct attached storage DAS from a list of servers in a SQL table via PowerShell.  The commands to grab the DAS must be run locally from the server its attached to.  Because each server can have several DAS devices attached, Ive opted to create an array for each server and populate that array with an object for each DAS unit.  Ive gotten the process nailed down and am able to iterate through each server and run the commands on each server remotely and capture the data I want within the remote sessions, however Im having trouble getting the array of objects back out of the remote sessions so that we can write this data to a database table.  If I call the array within the invokecommand scriptblock, all is well and I get the data I need  its only when I attempt to call it afterwards.  I dont plan to establish SQL sessions on each of these servers hundreds to write the data, so Id prefer to do it from the machine Im running this from.p  pBecause this data will be written directly to a database, Id also prefer to leverage it natively within PowerShell within the same script, rather than mess with exportingimporting files, csv, etc.  p  pI realize that PowerShell serializes objects on the wire, but my understanding is that it rehydrates it once its back to the local machine.

Thats the only response.p  pThe team working on the Go server is not very well versed with having a Go client based on websocketsajax nor do I.

Negative 1962 pI have just reinstalled Visual Studio 2013 Professional on Win 8.1 to try and fix this If I try to create a new Web Project, for either .Net 4.5 or 4.5.1, then I see the screen below.p  pIf I try to open an existing MVC 5 website one Ive just created through that wizard on another machine  then it works just fine.p  pEqually, if I set the target framework to 4 then I get the previous MVC 4 template appear, and emthatem works.p  pIf I look in the codeMicrosoft Visual Studio 12.0Common7IDEProjectTemplatesWebCSharp1033code folder then I see codeWebApplication45code which appears to contain the content that this project template uses  so why is it brokenp  pThe machine did emuseem to have VS2012 on it, and I notice that in the list of installed products for 2013 it has ASP.Net Web Frameworks and Tools 2012.2  which I believe is a VS 2012 thing.

Negative 1962 pIm doing a form where multiple tags appear when certain conditions in the request met, I wonder whether using jQuery to dynamically generate new HTML input tags, or doing all the HTML tags I need in the .jsp file.

Negative 1962 pIve been  working on my raytracer again. I added reflection and multithreading support. Currently I am working on adding refractions, but its only half working. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuoPCp.jpg altSpheresp  pAs you can see, there is a center spherewithout specular highlight, a reflecting sphereto the right and a refracting sphereleft. Im pretty happy about reflections, it does look very good. For refractions its kinda working...the light is refracted and all shadows of the spheres are visible in the sphererefraction index 1.4, but there is an outer black ring.p  pEDIT Apparently the black ring gets bigger, and therefore the sphere smaller, when I increase the refraction index of the sphere. On the contrary, when decreasing the index of refraction, the Sphere gets larger and the black ring smaller...until, with index of refraction set to one, the ring totally disappears.

So, I also cant display the banner message there, since the code wont get executed.p  pWhat could be the reason why the callback does not get called when the app is in background When it is in foreground, it works perfectly. Is it normal If yes, where else would I put my code to display the banner messagep  pIm using SDK version 3.4.0 on an iPhone 5 with iOS 8.1.1p  pPlease note that sending the banner text through the apnpayload is not the solution. There are other usecases. For example, when the server needs to tell the client that there is new content to sync, where the user does not even need to get notified for. The client should just download the new content in background just when the notification arrives.p

Negative 1962 pI am trying to make a snake game but I run into a few problems. I have this thread which contains the game loop but it doesnt seem to work. This is a simple form of my loop, I simplified it because it didnt work at first but it doesnt still. What happens is that my codestatecode variable gets reset to 0 after the first loop and I really have no clue why.

Negative 1962 pAlright, so I have a database, each with an ID, a name and a textvalue. p  pI wish to be able to print each of a specific row individually. When I use p  precoderesult  mysqlquerySELECT  FROM mytable, db row  mysqlfetcharrayresult echo row[text] codepre  pI am only able to print the first row, as it doesnt select any specifics. The problem is, Im not sure how to use the WHERE IDX, as I want the first one to print the first column, the second to print the second column and so forth there are a total of 13 lines. I want to echo them on different places on the page, so just calling everything at once is not what Im looking for.p  pThe way things are now, Ill have to use the code above for each time I want to print it, and manually edit the WHERE ID1 on the first print, the second to WHERE ID2 and so on, which is rather a pain in the ass.p  pAny suggestions is appreciated.p

The reason I know it isnt despite any errors is the fact that my codeloginCancelledLabelcode does not trigger when I click cancel.p  pIs there a way to associate the native way of creating the login button via codeFBLoginViewcode to the Parse functionality, or will I have to create a button and use a Facebook login image that sends the Parse functionality on the clickp  pHere is my AppDelegate.swiftp  precodeimport UIKit  UIApplicationMain class AppDelegate UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate       var window UIWindow       func applicationapplication UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions [NSObject AnyObject] gt Bool             Set Parse Application ID         Parse.setApplicationIdxxxxx, clientKeyxxxxx          Initialize Facebook         PFFacebookUtils.initializeFacebook           return true             func applicationWillResignActiveapplication UIApplication           Sent when the application is about to move from active to inactive state.

What I can do to make this feature happen as smoothly as possible.p  pEDIT More detailed explanationp  pIn normal signup formsactivity you have a fileds to double confirm your password. One is you type the passwod and again the other time to confirm that you have typed the correct password as you want, this is pretty self explanatory. In my application I want to make these two in to only one EDITTEXT controller, SO which means once the user types in the password for the first time AND loose focus, i want to bring the focus back to the same EDITTEXT controller and ask him to type the confirmpassword, so once he does that and when he presses the signup button in my activity then I will check if the password typed the first time and the second time matches and proceed to signup. Hope this is clear enough this is the part i am not sure how to capture how to loose focus once he finishes the typing of password the second timep

Negative 1962 pIs it necessary to write an entire function to get a swipe gesture to select an index row Typically for a table view you would use codeindexPathForSelectedRowcode. But if you dont want to have it be necessary for a user to actually press the cell and then swipe to get the correct index object to load in the detail view is there a class available for that, a connection in Storyboard, or do you need to write your ownp  pCurrently the correct objects load when a row is selected and then swiped but if I just swipe I get the default value I set instead of the what would appear for codeindexPathForSelectedRowcode. p  precodeoverride func prepareForSeguesegue UIStoryboardSegue, sender AnyObject       var upcoming AnswerTable  segue.destinationViewController as AnswerTable      if segue.identifier  loadAnswerTableView           let indexPath  self.tableView.indexPathForSelectedRow          printlnindexPath          let obj PFObject  self.objectAtIndexPathindexPath      upcoming.parseObject  obj      self.tableView.deselectRowAtIndexPathindexPath, animated true       codepre  pThis codeprepareForSeguecode function is triggered by a UISwipeGesture that is implemented in Interface BuilderStoryboard. Because the function gets the data to pass to the detail view from  codelet indexPath  self.tableView.indexPathForSelectedRowcode the cell must be physically selected by the user touching the table cell and selecting it. Instead of the user having to do this I want the UI to recognize that I want the data from the cell that was swiped over to be passed to the detail view controller. p  pIm sure this can be done programmatically, though I dont know the correct implementation yet. But before going in and doing it programmatically I am wondering if there is a way to assign the swipe gesture to the codeprepareForSeguecode method through Storyboard or if there is a class in the UIKit that can handle this. p

Negative 1962 pIm writing a userscript for tumblr that makes ajax calls to its API over an array of data and I need the responses to come in the order the data was in the array. I was advised to use Promises for that as the article shows a hrefhttpwww.html5rocks.comentutorialses6promisestocparallelismsequencing relnofollowhttpwww.html5rocks.comentutorialses6promisestocparallelismsequencinga. p  pIt works on individual tumblr blog pages, but not on the dashboard, where native implementation of Promise is overwritten by their a hrefhttpssecure.assets.tumblr.comclientprodappvendorindex.js relnofollowindex.jsa. As the result, their Promise lacks .resolve ability and my code doesnt work.p  pCan I still find a way to use the native Promise or do I have to seek other ways Id prefer to stick with Promises to avoid having different code for a single use case. Alternatively, I would have to use jQuery for same functionality and I dont really know how.p  pRight now Im solving this by forceloading of Promise polyfill from GitHub, but this doesnt feel right.p

Negative 1962 pWhen you create a Controller, Symfony2 states that it is possible to use the command line codephp appconsole generatecontrollercode.

Since I want to do the latter can I just manually make one in an existing Controller class If yes would I have to update any other files in my project Thanks in advance.p

Negative 1962 pI have a shortlist no more then ten or so items that I want a user to match against another list. The order may be random and they may reassign any value as they see fit. I want to indicate values already assigned but not necessarily prevent their reassignment. How would one achieve this in Qt  Preferably PyQt but cpp is good too.p  pThese requirements indicate that one should use the QSortFilterProxyModel which proxies a QListItemModel QAbstractItemListModel and possibly a QSelectionModel. p  pAs an example lets argue that we have the categories First, Second and Third Language. We have the options English, Afrikaans, German, Dutch and Russian. We would expect the user to assign say Afrikaans to first, English to second and German to the Third Language boxes. Later they may decide they speak better Russian then say Afrikaans and want to change the first block again. Alternatively they may want to swap German and English.p  pMy first bash at this is as follows  p  precodefrom PyQt5 import QtGui, QtWidgets, QtCore  class QListModelQtCore.QAbstractListModel    def initself, args, data  [], kvps   super.initargs, kvps    self.updatedata   def rowCountself, index   return lenself.data   def updateself, data  []   self.data  data   def dataself, index, role  QtCore.Qt.DisplayRole    if not index.isValid      printinValid   object  self.data[index.row]   roles   0strobject,     object.textrow,col       if role in roles.keys     return roles[role]   else     return None     def maindata   app    QtWidgets.QApplicationsys.argv  main   QtWidgets.QMainWindow  cntr   QtWidgets.QWidgetmain  hbox   QtWidgets.QHBoxLayoutcntr  vbox   QtWidgets.QVBoxLayoutcntr  model  QListModeldata  data   proxy  QtCore.QSortFilterProxyModel  proxy.setSourceModelmodel  enum   QtWidgets.QListViewmain  enum.setModelproxy  select  enum.selectionModel  combos  [QtWidgets.QComboBoxmain for i in range3]  [item.setModelproxy for item in combos]  [item.view.setSelectionModelselect for item in combos]  [vbox.addWidgetitem for item in combos]  hbox.addLayoutvbox  hbox.addWidgetenum  main.setCentralWidgetcntr  main.show  app.exec  if name  main   import sys  Move  main[,English,Afrikaans,Russian,German,Dutch] codepre  pThis uses a single list between the different combos. The list on the right is to visualize whats potting when I make a selection. What I feel is missing is the highlighting of selected options within the Comboboxes. p  pI am considering the following approach p  pAllow each combobox to have its own selection model and feed the selectionChanged signals into a separate selection model in this case the one for the list which would retainmanage the entire selection. There is a problem in how one then updates the selections when one combobox picks another comboboxes option. I also can not see how the selection would feed back to the model, ideally one would disable an option once it was selected or atleast indicate its been selected elsewhere. Is it possible to feed the active selection into a QSortFilterProxy, using the active selection to modify the appearance of data in the different comboboxes p

Negative 1962 pIm trying to make a game that will tie into website content, and users accounts will be shared across the site multiple versions of the client.p  pThe problem is that the password needs to be salthashed in codePHPcode, and I need to be able to verify through codeJavacode, and I cant find any information on secure codecryptoscode like codePBKDF2code and ensuring that the generation is identical between codePHPcode and codeJavacode.p  pIve seen some info on using codePBKDF2code on codePHPcode, OR codeHmaccode with codeSHA1code, but not combining them as is suggested in the name of Javas codePBKDF2WithHmacSHA1code. I have a handle now on the individual hashing for codePHPcode or codeJavacode.  p  pHow do I set up the methods to be able to generate a salt and hash on codePHPcode, store it in codeMySQLcode and be able to verify passwords through Javas hashing functions  p  pWould prefer to stick with codePBKDF2code, if at all possible unless someone can suggest an equivalent that would work better for crosscompatibility.p  pP.S.

Negative 1962 pIm currently writing on a FileHandler, a class that simplifys operations on files which I need for my program. p  pMy question is which way would be best to save the file in my class. Would it be best to save the path of my file as a stdstring and reopen it in every function that uses the file, or would it be best if Id save the actual stdfstream variable. Since its a codeFileHandlercode itll perfom a lot of operations on the same file in a lot of different functions. Down below is a quick demonstration of both waysp  pOpt. 1 would look like this p  precodeclass FileHandler  public     void foo               stdfstream fmpath         operations with f..      private     stdstring mpath save path of file here  codepre  pand Opt. 2 would look like this p  precodeclass FileHandler  public     void foo              operations on already opened mfile      private     stdfstream mfile save actual file  codepre  hr  pWhich version is quicker, saver and over all betterp  pOr is there even a better way For example copy the whole file into a vector and after every operation on the vector copy vector to file..p  pId appreciate you help.p

Negative 1962 pPlease consider metafunctions likep  precodeinclude lttypetraitsgt  template lttypename T, T N, T Mgt struct Sum  stdintegralconstant ltT, N  Mgt   template lttypename T, T N, T Mgt struct Product  stdintegralconstant ltT, N  Mgt  codepre  pTheir result can be extracted through the codevaluecode memberp  precodestaticassert Sum ltint, 3, 4gtvalue  7, 3  4  7 staticassert Product ltint, 2, 5gtvalue  10, 2  5  10 codepre  pBoth metafunctions have a similar static signature. That is, they associate a codeTcode to every pair of codeTcodes where codeTcode is subject to the same restrictions as those imposed by codestdintegralconstantcode and either being summable or multipliable. So we can create a generic metafunction to do the evaluation.p  precodetemplate lttypename T, template lttypename U, U, Ugt class F, T N, T Mgt struct EvaluateBinaryOperator  stdintegralconstant ltT, F ltT, N, Mgtvaluegt   staticassert EvaluateBinaryOperator ltint, Sum, 3, 4gtvalue  7, 3  4  7 staticassert EvaluateBinaryOperator ltint, Product, 2, 5gtvalue  10, 2  5  10 codepre  pWhen used solely in this form, it feels redundant to to pollute codeSumcode and codeProductcode with the structure of an codestdintegralconstantcode. To show you that we can do without indeed, please consider the followingp  precodetemplate lttypename T, T N, T M, T R  N  Mgt struct Sum  template lttypename T, T N, T M, T R  N  Mgt struct Product  template lttypenamegt struct EvaluateBinaryOperator  template lttypename T, template lttypename U, U, U, Ugt class F, T N, T M, T Rgt struct EvaluateBinaryOperator ltF ltT, N, M, Rgt gt  stdintegralconstant ltT, Rgt   staticassert EvaluateBinaryOperator ltSum ltint, 3, 4gt gtvalue  7, 3  4  7 staticassert EvaluateBinaryOperator ltProduct ltint, 2, 5gt gtvalue  10, 2  5  10 codepre  pInstead of using members of codeSumcode and codeProductcode, we specialize on a default argument and extract it only in codeEvaluateBinaryOperatorcode. As an added bonus, codeSumcode and codeProductcode can remain without definition, rendering them trivially noninferrable and nonconstructable and the syntax looks much cleaner too. Now, heres the catch. What if we would like all our metafunctions to have a uniform static interface That is, what if we introducep  precodetemplate lttypename...gt struct Tuple  template lttypename T, Tgt struct Value codepre  pand require all our metafunctions to look like codetemplate lttypenamegt structcode For instance,p  precodetemplate lttypenamegt struct Sum  template lttypename T, T N, T Mgt struct Sum ltTuple ltValue ltT, Ngt, Value ltT, Mgt gt gt       stdintegralconstant ltT, N  Mgt   template lttypenamegt struct Product  template lttypename T, T N, T Mgt struct Product ltTuple ltValue ltT, Ngt, Value ltT, Mgt gt gt       stdintegralconstant ltT, N  Mgt  codepre  pNow, we would like to transform them to something likep  precodetemplate lttypename, typenamegt struct Sum  template lttypename T, T N, T M, typename R  Tuple ltValue ltT, N  Mgt gt gt struct Sum ltTuple ltValue ltT, Ngt, Value ltT, Mgt gt, Rgt  template lttypename, typenamegt struct Product  template lttypename T, T N, T M, typename R  Tuple ltValue ltT, N  Mgt gt gt struct Product ltTuple ltValue ltT, Ngt, Value ltT, Mgt gt, Rgt codepre  pSuch that we can extract values withp  precodetemplate lttypenamegt struct Evaluate  template lttemplate lttypename, typenamegt class F, typename I, typename Ogt struct Evaluate ltF ltI, Ogt gt      typedef O Type   staticassert stdissame lt     Evaluate ltSum ltTuple ltValue ltint, 3gt, Value ltint, 4gt gt gt gtType,     Tuple ltValue ltint, 7gt gt gtvalue, 3  4  7 staticassert stdissame lt     Evaluate ltProduct ltTuple ltValue ltint, 2gt, Value ltint, 5gt gt gt gtType,     Tuple ltValue ltint, 10gt gt gtvalue, 2  5  10 codepre  pThose of you familiar with the C standard will immediately point to 14.5.58 The template parameter list of a specialization shall not contain default template argument values., accompanied by the teasing footnote There is no way in which they could be used.. Indeed, feeding just about any modern compiler this code yields a compiler error on the codeSumcode and codeProductcode template specializations about violation of the standard. Apart from proving the aforementioned footnote to lack the imagination of the author weve created ourselves a valid use case for them.p  pMy question can now be put Are there any other ways to achieve a similar effect where codeSumcode and codeProductcode remain undefined  incomplete types, thereby trivially being noninferrable and nonconstructable, while still carrying responsibility for performing the operation Any suggestions are welcome.

Negative 1962 pI have a section of C code for a PIC device, it actuates 4 separate relays to a predefined pattern, each individually set by counting on times, and frequency of occurrence. This pattern continues adinfinitum, but found the timing on standard delayms not accurate enough. I wish to convert it to ISR routine, I enclose the code below that relies on standard delay for your perusal, my main concern is how to abstract this code to ISR as I know not to stick all this code in the actual ISR routine, any advice greatly appreciated.p  precodeCONFIGFOSCXT amp WDTEOFF amp PWRTEOFF amp MCLREOFF amp CPOFF amp CPDOFF amp         BORENOFF amp CLKOUTENOFF amp IESOOFF amp FCMENOFF   use BORVHI for latest PICC compiler CONFIGWRTOFF amp PLLENOFF amp STVRENOFF amp LVPOFF         define XTALFREQ  4000000  unsigned long int SamplePeriod 20 unsigned long int SampleDuration  2 unsigned long int SampleON  0 unsigned long int WriteTXPeriod  21 unsigned long int WriteTXDuration  1    unsigned long int WriteTXON  0 unsigned long int DepassPeriod  60 every 7 days for depass event unsigned long int DepassDuration  10   depass for 120 seconds unsigned long int DepassON  0  unsigned long int DepassCounter  0 unsigned long int SampleCounter  0 unsigned long int WriteTXCounter  0 unsigned long int count  0 unsigned char input char data  1  void SkipLinevoid     printfn     printfr   void main      INTCON  0                  disable interrupts.

Negative 1962 pIve got three Programs codeProgramAcode, codeProgramBcode, codeProgramCcode.p  pcodeProgramAcode is a licensing tool for codeProgramBcode and codeProgramCcode.  Before codeProgramCcode came along, codeProgramAcode was installed into the install directory of codeProgramBcode and everything worked great.  p  pcodeProgramCcode is in development as a replacement for codeProgramBcode.  Since codeProgramBcode and codeProgramCcode need to have codeProgramAcode and Product Management didnt want to have two identical versions of the same executable installed into the Start menu, the decision was made to treat codeProgramAcode as its own product, create its own installer which would install it into its own specific install directory and have codeProgramBcode and codeProgramCcode reference it.  In order to do this, codeProgramAcode installed its interface DLL into the GAC for easy use with all three Programs.p  pNow heres the problem...p  pcodeProgramAcode will likely need to be upgraded at some point to support new features in codeProgramCcode.  Since customers will still need codeProgramBcode to support older hardware and it will only know to reference a specific version of codeProgramAcode, how can codeProgramAcode be updated so that it is able to support both codeProgramBcode and codeProgramCcode  p

The time is shown a separate column, so the user can pick a date then add a time.p  pThe datasource for the Datagridview is a datatable which has a datetime column called starttimep  pI think this isnt working because the combobox vales are just dates, and the dataproperty values are dates and times.p  pIve added a complete worked example below.p  precode    Private Sub Form1Loadsender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles MyBase.Load     Dim dt1 As New DataTable      dt1.Columns.AddStartDate, Type.GetTypeSystem.DateTime     dt1.Columns.AddStringData, Type.GetTypeSystem.String     dt1.Columns.AddNumberData, Type.GetTypeSystem.Double      Dim newrow As DataRow     newrow  dt1.NewRow     newrowStartDate  Date.Parse24072015 1200     newrowStringData  AAA     newrowNumberData  123     dt1.Rows.Addnewrow      newrow  dt1.NewRow     newrowStartDate  Date.Parse25072015 0900     newrowStringData  ABC     newrowNumberData  234     dt1.Rows.Addnewrow      newrow  dt1.NewRow     newrowStartDate  Date.Parse26072015 1000     newrowStringData  DEF     newrowNumberData  678     dt1.Rows.Addnewrow      DataGridView1.DataSource  dt1      Dim dt2 As New DataTable      dt2.Columns.AddDayDate, Type.GetTypeSystem.DateTime     dt2.Columns.AddDayName, Type.GetTypeSystem.String     dt2.Columns.AddTest, Type.GetTypeSystem.Double      Dim newrow2 As DataRow     newrow2  dt2.NewRow     newrow2DayDate  Date.Parse24072015     newrow2DayName  Date.Parse24072015.ToStringdddd     newrow2Test  123     dt2.Rows.Addnewrow2      newrow2  dt2.NewRow     newrow2DayDate  Date.Parse25072015     newrow2DayName  Date.Parse25072015.ToStringdddd     newrow2Test  234     dt2.Rows.Addnewrow2      newrow2  dt2.NewRow     newrow2DayDate  Date.Parse26072015     newrow2DayName  Date.Parse26072015.ToStringdddd     newrow2Test  678     dt2.Rows.Addnewrow2      Dim comboBoxColumn2 As New DataGridViewComboBoxColumn     comboBoxColumn2.DataPropertyName  StartDate      comboBoxColumn2.DisplayMember  DayName     comboBoxColumn2.ValueMember  DayDate      comboBoxColumn2.DataSource  dt2      comboBoxColumn2.Name  WorkingDay      DataGridView1.Columns.Insert0, comboBoxColumn2  End Sub codepre  pI get an errorp  blockquote   pSystem.ArgumentException DataGridViewComboBoxCell value is not valid.p blockquote  pIm guessing this is because the value in the combobox is 24082015 and the value in the datatsource of the datagridview the DataPropertyName is 24082015 0800.p  pIf I change these two valuesp  precode    comboBoxColumn2.DataPropertyName  NumberData      comboBoxColumn2.DisplayMember  Test codepre  pThe sample works as expected with no error.p  pHow can I set the DataPropertyName to just the Date and not the Date amp Timep

Negative 1962 pI have two comboboxes where the first one has categories and I can fill that easily from the source file.

Negative 1962 pI read the other day that the next standard of C will have modules which can be used like the well known Fortran modules .mod extension.p  pA C11 was foreseeing it, and I think it referred to the C14 standard, but if it will be in the standard was still uncertain.p  pFor what I heard we will have to wait until the next maybe C17 standard.p  pNow since we have object files, headers and libraries if we wish, I still do not understand what is so different about modules. p  pCreating a module in Fortran will hide the definitions for the user which in a header usually can be seen by the user, of course as forward declaration.

Negative 1962 pThis is not a practical question, I just want to discuss and learn data structure design here, I heard its asked by Google during onsite interview. Please advise me how to improve my design, thanksp  pAt the beginning I wanted to use a deque to store pairs of x,y coordinates for snakes body parts. p  precodedequeltpairltx, ygtgt snakeBodyParts codepre  pBecause its very easy to push front when snake move  create new coordinate pair as the new head base on old head position and current direction, then pop back to remove the tail. In this way move, eat, check head hit wall are all O1 operations and easy to implement with deque. But checking if new head position overlap with snakes body will require looping through all body parts position  OL time complexity, L is number of body parts.p  pTo improve it, I thought about putting all coordinates into an unorderedsetC or hashsetJava while still keeping my old deque, it can give me O1 for checking if head hits body now. But I dont know if its a good idea because it almost doubles the memory and amount of codes, whenever I addremove to deque, I need to do it to my hashset.p  precodeunorderedsetltpairltint, intgt, pairhashgt bodyPartsSet codepre  pI also thought about creating my own structure which is like linkedlist, except it points to previous nodep  precodeSnakeBodyNode      int x     int y     SnakeBodyNode  prev  codepre  pThen I also need two pointers pointing at head and tail as well as a direction variable.p  precodeSnakeBodyNode  head SnakeBodyNode  tail char dir codepre  pHowever I dont see any advantage of this, still need to hash to get O1 for checking if head hits body..p  pIs there any flaw in my deque  hash design or any one have better idea to share p

Negative 1962 pi am working for a company and my manager wanted a map for the employees in which they can see where our clients are and who is responsible for the single clients.

Negative 1962 pI have started a new domain for a client, and made sure everything works well, however it still has to resolve.  I was Setting nameservers from clients server to our own. p  pBut the client already wanted to send emails. So I have made him a few using DirectAdmin. Although they dont work yet and I get the standard 550 error. And so I was thinking this probably has something to do with either the domain or mail not being resolved yet.p  pSo I was wondering what the standard resolve time is for mailboxes or does this entirly depend on the domainname resolve time I could not find anything via the DA documentation. Any tips or help would be greatly appriciated. p
Negative 1962 pI have tried this with an empty project. Integrating the FacebookSDK.a lib which is linked by the official Unity Facebook plugin makes the size of the stronginstalled appstrong appname.app jump from 89MB to 70MB.p  pNote that I am not talking about ipa size which stays normal, but really the installed app size.p  pI dont think this is normal and I am wondering if there is a way not to link the FacebookSDK.a and do it with the normal FBSDKCoreKit.framework instead  or actually any other way that doesnt have such a huge impact on installed app size.p

Negative 1962 pI have a Maven WAR project, managed under Eclipse using codem2ecode and codem2ewtpcode. In my codepom.xmlcode, I configure the codemavenwarplugincode to filter some resources in codesrcmainresourcescode, and to put them in the classpath.p  pMy files are correctly filtered, both in codeprojecttargetfinalnameWEBINFclassescode and in codeprojecttargetm2ewtpwebresourcesWEBINFclassescode. However, when I run my webapp using codeJ2EE Previewcode, the values are read unfiltered. p  pAfter investigating, I discovered that the files read, in my webapp launched on the codeJ2EE Previewcode server, were located in codeWORKSPACE.metadata.pluginsorg.eclipse.wst.server.coretmp0projectWEBINFclassescode, and that they were unfiltered. p  pSo it seems that codem2ewtpcode is correctly doing his job here, but that the server adapter somehow messes up the filtering. It seems to acquire the unfiltered resources directly from codesrcmainresourcescode, to put them in the code.metadatacode dir, instead of acquiring them from codeprojecttargetcode. p  pHow could I make sure that the server adapter acquires the filtered resourcesp
Negative 1962 h3BackgroundExampleh3  pI currently have a class like the followingp  precodeclass Element    Large l1   OtherLarge l2   Small s1   VerySmall s2  codepre  pwhere codeLargecode and codeOtherLargecode are relatively big 80 bytes whereas codeSmallcode and codeVerySmallcode are fairly small 4 to 16 Byte.p  pOn these elements, I operate in two waysp  ul lisorting them in various ways. During this, only members codes1code and codes2code are accessedneeded.li licombining the large members in various way e.g. matrixmatrix multiplication.li ul  pThe second class of operations is already fairly fast and can be parallelised easily, hence Id like to speed up the first class of operations more. Comparing with another class codeElement2code where I replaced the two big data members by 8byte integers doing nothing tells me that if I can somehow replace the direct data members codel1code and codel2code by pointers of one sort or another to dynamicallyallocated elements elsewhere, Ill already get a big win.p  pFor reference, all member types have both copy and move constructors and can be both copied and moved, but moving them is much much cheaper. codeLargecode and codeOtherLargecode also allocate a lot of memory by themselves, so allocating a bit more isnt necessarily horrible.p  h3Concrete questionh3  pIs it possible, and if so, what is the best way, to replace a direct member object of a class with a pointer to a dynamicallyallocated object elsewhere preserving the behaviour of a direct member as closely as possible w.r.t construction, destruction, member variable access etc If I use a codestduniqueptrltLargegtcode naively, I assume Ill have to dereference it half the timetake care of copying specially Ideally Id like the new member object to behave just as if the old, big member object was still there.p
