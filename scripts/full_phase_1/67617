Positive 67617 pI have a custom routing system on my web application where i have a database with my routes codeurlcode, codeControllercode, codeActioncode and some more info. Every request that is made to the server goes to the database, queries that route by the url and returns a set of that i need to keep accessible for the future rendering codeFiltercode, codeControllercode and codeViewcode, i keep this data at a global var at my Global.asax filep  precodepublic static class GlobalVars      public static Redirect reqContext  get set      public static UnidadeHotSite HotSite  get set   codepre  pMy problem is that right now this information is getting mixed through users, sometimes when im at my browser and i have 3 open tabs and i refresh them at almost the same time the last one will get the route data of the previous loaded one.p  pFor example my codeHotSitecode var keeps some subsite information like codenamecode, codeurlcode, codeIDcode, etc., the subsite url would be abc.comsubsite. When i load the first tab i get the right data which is the subsite data, the second tab is off the subsite area, abc.com, and i get the same data as the last loaded tab.p  pNow, what could be the problem  I already used the codeNoStorecode on the codeOutputCachecode and tried to disable the session but nothing seems to work.p  pThis is my Route Handlerp  precode[OutputCache NoStore  true,

Below is my complete data source as stated in web.config.p  precodedata sourcelocalhostinitial catalogDatabase1integrated securityFalseUser idsapassword12345 codepre  pThe issue is when I call codeconStr.Database.Connection.ConnectionStringcode for my dbcontext in my code above. When I check the value of my connection string, I found out that the password is missing, so it return the following connection string value     data sourcelocalhostinitial catalogDatabase1integrated securityFalseUser idsap  pMy password is missing in the return connection string value, but its clearly listed in the web config. p  pAfter lots of investigation, I found the solution to make sure the password is there when I use ADO net connection property is to include codePersist Security InfoTruecode in my web.config. Then, my complete connection string can be called without any missing element. p  pThis solve my earlier issue BUT I also found articles stated that codePersist Security Infocode must not set the True for security purpose. p  pI had consulted my senior and he suggested to put remove the user Id and password from web.config, encrypt both user id and password value, and put them as an App Key, then modify the data source as belowp  precodedata sourcelocalhostinitial catalogDatabase1integrated securityFalsePersist Security InfoTrueUser id0password1 codepre  pWhen I call the data source from my code behind, I should get the encrypted user id and password App Key, decrypt them, then use string.format as below to reformat the string valuep  precodestring strConStr  string.FormatstrConStr, strAppKeyUserId, strAppKeyPassword codepre  pNow my question is, is my senior suggestion a suitable method to cater for Persist Security InfoTrue I feels like its the same but cant really tell the exact impact by applying the suggested method or not. Either way, as long as Im setting codePersist Security InfoTruecode, the password will return back to the connection. p  pAlso, a side note, I cant use codeSystem.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[ConStr].ConnectionStringcode because the code above locate inside a repository solution that doesnt have web.config, only app.config. I can only format the connection string value in my application and pass the complete connection string value into the method. p  pPlease enlighten me on this. Thank you. p

Positive 67617 pIn my asp.net mvc application session factory is cached on application level. Than new session is created and closed on each request.  Unfortunately logging service which is subscribed on PostUpdate, PostInsert events of the session factory requires current user id. Thus it is created in request scope. So its possible that more than one instance of the logging service exists at the same time and listen events from the session factorysession in case if more than one request is handled at the same time. As a result changes of one user will raise event on session factory which will be stored by all existing instances of the logger service.p  pThe solution could be subscribing on session rather than on session factory. This will shrink scope of the logger services dependencies to a single requests scope.p  pMy questions is Is there any way to register event listener for particular nhibernate session rather than for whole session factoryp

Negative 67617 pHeres a question that I dont quite understandp  pThe command, codesystempausecode is taught to new programmers as a way to pause a program and wait for a keyboard input to continue. However, it seems to be frowned on by many veteran programmers as something that should not be done in varying degrees.p  pSome people say it is fine to use. Some say it is only to be used when you are locked in your room and no one is watching. Some say that they will personally come to your house and kill you if you use it. p  pI, myself am a new programmer with no formal programming training. I use it because I was taught to use it. What I dont understand is that if it is not something to be used, then why was I taught to use it Or, on the flip side, is it really not that bad after allp  pWhat are your thoughts on this subjectp

Negative 67617 pThank you all ahead of time. This is my first time developing a jQuery plugin and first time developing in javascript as well actually, and I have to say Im pretty geeked It probably has many hideous things to you seasoned jsjquery developers, but this is my first attempt  please bear with me .

This needs to be as customizable as possible, so I am attemping to provide some hooks    anonymous functions  the user can use to pass custom code to the plugin.p  pThe problem I am having is providing parameters to the user function. If I use the keyword this, I can pass the msg variable fine and the user function can use it. But when I pass msg instead of this the user gets a blank variable. I would like to pass more than just the msg  also an array of data passed in the ajax call and a jQuery object of the model box is what I would really like to do.p  pBelow is the snippet  the function is inside of and called within the plugin I just grouped some code into functions for organizationdevelopment purposes.p  precode Submits the form inside of the model box  and calls the user hooks of onFormSuccess and  onFormFailure for ajax success and error function submitForm  var URL  form,contentNode.attraction,  method  form,contentNode.attrmethod, data  form,contentNode.formSerialize  .ajax url URL, type method, data data, success functionmsg   Doesnt work, but I would like it too settings.onFormSuccess.callmsg, breakDatadata   Does work settings.onFormSuccess.callthis , error function XMLHttpRequest, textStatus, errorThrown  setings.onFormFailure.callerrorThrown   closeModel  codepre

Negative 67617 pI have a class that represents the state of the world.

The presentation layer has only reference to the IWorld object which World implements, and it has no way to access the elements within. p  pThe UI thread should lock the strongcompletestrong state of the world so the world cant be changed by the server during the drawing that would make an inconsistent world picture. Since it has only reference to the IWorld object, this is the only thing to be locked. p  pMy question is whether this lock would suffice that is, lock all fields and properties  this object has, recursively, or each object should be locked separately. What is the right approach to this problemp  pstrongNotestrong UI has no way to contact server meaning it cant tell server to stop changing the world, and then tell it to resume after rendering.p  pstrongEDITstrong  If the World and all classes in hierachy implement ILock interface which provides Lock method which would call Lock on all lower levels recursively, this would probably be prone to deadlock cyclic references or simply be too expensive.p  pemI guess design change is in order.emp
Negative 67617 pIm building a SaaS app and have some issues in dealing with authorization and ASP.NET MVC. I have a previous a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1392074helpwith2partquestiononaspnetmvcandcustomsecuritydesignquestiona and this is kind of taking a cue from comments there. I need to provide somewhat granular security e.g. lots of permissions for each user. I realize that any discretionary system can be modeled as a roles system by just creating more roles. But thats a lot more roles than I want to deal with. I dont think roles is going to work for me and would like to work more at the permissions level. p  pI know the standard response to any question dealing with ASP.NET and authorization is create all your application users as Windows users and implement the ASP.NET Membership Provider. One issue, Im not going to create Windows users. My question is can the standard ASP.NET MVC AuthorizeAttribute and AuthorizeCore be made to fit with a permissions modelp  pAlso, apparently, the impetus here is really that ASP.NET MVC Caching will break a custom security implementation. Obviously, I dont want my pages to run slowly but Im not sure I want this caching at all. Im building a business application is caching everything really appropriate It seems that caching would just make concurrency problems much more difficult than they already are. For example, if I am caching all of my customer info pages, including the edit pages, then wont I be defeating any concurrency controls I would have in place say, timestamp checking p

Negative 67617 pIm doing a simple forum with a series of codeServletscode that each represent a home, topic, postedit, login and userlist page.

In order to do this, I see two solutions.p  pThe first solution is to have an HTML codeFormcode with a login button and an invisible field that will contain information that will say what page to redirect as a codeParametercode.  This is doable but Id like to try something else.p  pThe second solution is to add an codeAttributecode to the codesessioncode that represents the first page in some way. This could contain a String but this is no different from the first approach. Another twist would be to add a reference to the HttpServlet and to use instanceof or a static String variable that could be used to identify the Servlet in some way. However, this would require creating a common ancestor class for all the codeServletscode.p  pPerhaps there is another simple solution that you can see that would form a good compromise  Or, maybe one of the above solutions is perfectly acceptable p

Negative 67617 pI need to choose an authentication method for an application installed and integrated in customers environment. There are two types of environments  windows and linuxunix. Application is user based, no web stuff, pure Java. The requirement is to authenticate users which will use my application against customer provided user base. Meaning, customer installs my app, but uses his own users to grant or deny access to my app. Typical, rightp  pI have three options to consider and I need to pick up the one which would be a the most flexible to cover most common modern environments and b would take least effort while stay robust and standard.p  pstrongOption 1strong  Authenticate locally managing user credentials in some local storage, e.g. file. Customer would then add his users to my application and it will then check the passwords. Simple, clumsy but would work. Customers would have to punch every user they want to grant access to my app using some UI we will have to provide. Lots of work for me, headache to the customer.p  pstrongOption 2strong  Use LDAP authentication. Customers would tell my app where to look for users and I will walk their directory resolving names into user names and trying to bind with found password. This is better approach IMO, but more fragile because I will have to walk an unknown directory structure and who knows if this will be permitted everywhere. Would be harder to test since there are many LDAP implementation out there, last thing I want is drowning in this voodoo. p  pstrongOption3strong  Use plain Kerberos authentication. Customers would tell my app what realm domain and which KDC key distribution center to use. In ideal world these two parameters would be all I need to set while customers could use their own administration tools to configure domain and kdc. My application would simply delegate user credentials to this third party using JAAS or Spring security and consider success when third party is happy with them.p  pI personally prefer 3, but not sure what surprises I might face. Would this cover windows and nix systems entirely Is there another option to considerp

Negative 67617 pIm in the process of writing a kind of runtime systeminterpreter, and one of things that I need to be able to do is call cc functions located in external libraries.p  pOn linux Im using the codedlfcn.hcode functions to open a library, and call a function located within. The problem is that, when using codedlsysmcode the function pointer returned need to be cast to an appropriate type before being called so that the function arguments and return type are know, however if Im calling some arbitrary function in a library then obviously I will not know this prototype at compile time.p  pSo what Im asking is, is there a way to call a dynamically loaded function and pass it arguments, and retrieve its return value emwithoutem knowing its prototypep  pSo far Ive come to the conclusion there is not easy way to do this, but some workarounds that Ive found arep  ul lipEnsure all the functions I want to load have the same prototype, and provide some sort mechanism for these functions to retrieve parameters and return values.

Negative 67617 p1 I understand that when youre converting binary to decimal the left most bit represents 0, 1...so on. So for example to convert 0001 to decimal it is 020021022123 so the decimal value would be 8. p  p2 When for example you have signed hex 0x80 which will be converted to binary 1000 0000 however in order to compute the decimal value for this binary representation it is signed so we have to invert 7 bits so we get 1111111 and add 1 which gives us 10000000 which is 128.p  pMy question is why in the second case when were computing the decimal for the signed byte we had to start from right most bits as 0 so we have ....128. Why isnt the 20 the left most bit as we computed in 1 for the second casep  pThanks.p

Negative 67617 pIm trying to understand what logic determines whether a user can log in with a particular MLS sensitivity level. At first I suspected that pamselinux.so reads the etcselinux...seusers file to understand which user is bound to which seuser and then restricts the user to sensitivities equal to or lower than the high component of the MLS range.p  pHowever, after scratching through its source code I found that, after asking the user if he would like to change their security context from the the default context, pamselinux checks that the new MLS labels are appropriate by calling into the kernel policy.p  pThe following code is in modulespamselinuxpamselinux.c from the Ubuntu libpammodules 1.1.14ubuntu2 package.p  precodestatic int mlsrangeallowedpamhandlet pamh, securitycontextt src, securitycontextt dst, int debug    struct avdecision avd   int retval   unsigned int bit  CONTEXTCONTAINS   contextt srccontext  contextnew src   contextt dstcontext  contextnew dst   contextrangesetdstcontext, contextrangegetsrccontext   if debug     pamsyslogpamh, LOGNOTICE, Checking if s mls range valid for  s, dst, contextstrdstcontext    retval  securitycomputeavcontextstrdstcontext, dst, SECCLASSCONTEXT, bit, ampavd   contextfreesrccontext   contextfreedstcontext   if retval  bit amp avd.allowed  bit     return 0    return 1  codepre  pIt seems to me that this check is actually checked in the kernel policy, seen in the securitycomputeav call. This turned my understanding of SELinux login on my head.p  pSo, could someone please explainp  ul lipHow is the validity of a userchosen login security level determinedpli lipHow exactly is that logic implemented in the policy, in pamselinux, and in the kernelpli ul  pCurrently, Im not too interested in type enforcement multi, categories security, or role based access control, so no need to explain how those components are validated if they dont affect MLS sensitivities.p

Negative 67617 pLet me give a back ground for everybody before I go to my problem. My company hosts website for many clients, my company also contracts some of the work to another company.  So when we first set up a website with all the informations to our clients, we pass that information to the other company we contracted and three of us have the same data. Problem is once the site is up and running, our clients will change some data and when ever they do that we should be able to update our contracted company. The way we transfer data to the contracted company is by using a web service httppost, xml data. Now my question is what it the best way to write a program which sends updated data to the contracted company everytime our clients change some data.p  p1 Write a windows service having a timer inside my code where every 30min or so connects to the database and find all changes and send it to the contracted company 2 Write the same code as 1 with out the timer in it but this time make it a simple program and let windows scheduler wake it every 30min 3 Any other suggestion you may havep  pTechenologies available for me are VS 2008, SQLServer 2005p

Negative 67617 pIm applying an AVMutableAudioMix to a asset Ive created, the asset generally consists of 35 audio tracks no video. The goal is to add several volume commands throughout the play time, ie Id like to set the volume to 0.1 at 1 seconds, 0.5 at 2 seconds, then 0.1 or whatever at 3 seconds. Im just now trying to do this with an AVPlayer but will also later use it when exporting the AVSession to a file. The problem is that it only seems to care about the first volume command, and seem to ignore all later volume commands. If the first command is to set the volume to 0.1, that will be the permanent volume for this track for the rest of this asset. Despite it really looks like you should be able to add any number of these commands, seeing as the inputParameters member of AVMutableAudioMix is really an NSArray which is the series of AVMutableAudioMixInputParameters. Anyone figured this outp  pEdit I figured this partly out. Im able to add several volume changes throughout a certain track. But the timings appear way off, Im not sure how to fix that. For example setting the volume to 0.0 at 5 seconds, then 1.0 at 10 seconds and then back to 0.0 at 15 seconds would make you assume the volume would go on and off promptly at those timings, but the results are always very unpredictable, with ramping of sounds going on, and sometimes working with sudden volume changes as expected from setVolume. If anyone got the AudioMix to work, please provide an example.p

Negative 67617 pSimilar topics have been covered in other threads, but I couldnt find a definitive solution to my problem.p  pWhat were trying to achieve is to design a web app which is able to p  ol liread a datasource configuration at startup an XML file containing multiple datasource    definitions, which is placed outside the WAR file and its not the applicationcontext or hibernate configuration fileli licreate a session factory for each one of them considering that each datasource is a database with a different schemali liswitch at runtime to different datasources based on user input users can select which datasource they want to useli liprovide the correct dao object to manage user requests.li ol  pAt the moment we have a DAO Manager object which is able to read the datasource configuration file and instantiate multiple session factories, saving them in a map. Each session factory is created with a configuration containing the proper hibernate mapping classes different for each database schema. Moreover we have multiple DAO interfaces with their implementations, used to access their database.p  pAt this point we would need a way to get from the DAO Manager a specific DAO object, containing the right session factory attached, all based on the user request basically a call from the above service containing the datasource id or a custom datasource object.p  pIdeally the service layer should use the DAO Manager to get a DAO object based on the datasource id for instance, without worrying about its actual implementation the DAO Manager would take care of it, by creating the correct DAO object and injecting in it the right session factory, based on the datasource id.p  pMy questions arep  ul liIs this a good approach to followli liHow can I use Spring to dynamically inject in the DAO Manager multiple DAO  implementations for each DAO interfaceli liOnce the session factories are created, is there a way to let Spring handle them, as I would normally do with dependency injection inside the applicationcontext.xmlli liWould the 2nd Level Cache still work for each Session Factoryli ul

Negative 67617 pI am working on a tool which generated a few thousand ASCII files constraints, the contents of which include floating point numbers. I would like to run these constraints for comparison through an similar tool, which cannot handle floating point values with more than 20 decimal places. Testing manually indicates that simple truncation will suffice. So, how can I truncate all floating point values in a file which are uniquely marked by a period to no more than 20 decimal placesp  pThanks,p  pJonp

I think its been explained by Leonid, also in a comment in brief, try codeClearAttributes[Dynamic, ReadProtected]code then codeDynamiccode and you can see that there is a definition codeDynamicMakeBoxes[BoxFormxDynamic,StandardForm]code etc. As my understanding of frontend programming is negligible I wont try to explain it here, so if anybody does post an answer explaining that, it would be appreciated.p

Top Heading My test string My sub Heading My second My deep Heading string now again Top Heading My test string My sub Heading My second My deep Heading string now againp  pThe basic theory is this.p  pWhen you hit your first [H1], you increment the counter to 1. When you hit the h2, your second level counter is incremented to 1. When you hit the h3, your third level counter is incremented to 1.p  pThis will obviously output 1.1.1.p  pNow when you hit the next h1, they sub levels ie not the main level are reset to 0, and then the first level is incremented to 2. You hit the h2, and it goes to 1 again... Then you have first level 2, sub 1, sub 1  2.1.1.p

Negative 67617 pI am using jQuery and jQueryui and want to animate various attributes on various objects. p  pFor the sake of explaining the issue here Ive simplified it to one div that changes from blue to red when the user mouses over it.p  pI am able to get the behavior I want when using codeanimatecode, however when doing so the styles I am animating have to be in the animation code and so are separate from my style sheet. see strongexample 1strongp  pAn alternative is using codeaddClasscode and coderemoveClasscode but I have not been able to recreate the exact behavior that I can get with codeanimatecode. see strongexample 2strongp  hr  h2Example 1h2  pLets take a look at the code I have with codeanimatecodep  precodesomeDiv   .mouseoverfunction     this.stop.animate backgroundColorblue, duration500      .mouseoutfunction     this.stop.animate backgroundColorred, duration500    codepre  pit displays all the behaviors I am looking forp  ol liAnimates smoothly between red and blue.li liNo animation overqueueing when the user moves their moue quickly in and out of the div.li liIf the user moves their mouse outin while the animation is still playing it eases correctly between the current halfway state and the new goal state.li ol  pBut since the style changes are defined in codeanimatecode I have to change the style values there, and cant just have it point to my stylesheet.

Negative 67617 pI have been given the task to design and develop a web application for a NGO Non Govt Org which runs primary schools in many towns and villages. The application will keep a record of all the schools, students, volunteers and the teachers of every school. Currently there are about 30 schools in the NGOs umbrella but they have very ambitious plan to increase the number very rapidly. We will host the app on strongWindows Azurestrong using strongSQL Azurestrong as the database. Now I am facing a tough task on how to design its database with minimum expenditure as the NGO is funded completely by charities and donations. As you might know that the databases in SQL Azure is offered in specific sizes like 5,10,20 to 50 GB, it puts a restriction on the maximum size of each database. I have came out with following approachesp  p1 For every school create a separate database of 5 or 10 GB size. Each database will have tables like student,subject,attendance etc. The problem in this approach is that a lot of databases will have to be created. One for every school. This would drastically shoot up the cost. Also initially a large portion of 10 GB size will be underutilized, but in future it may happen that 10GB would seem less for storing a schools data.p  p2 Keep a single database with tables like school,student,attendance etc. This would keep the cost low initially but during course of time the database would start filling up and may reach the max limit of 50GB as more schools are opened by the NGO. Also a single table for student and especially attendance will have huge number of records and would make the queries slow. Even if we add another database in future then how easy would it be to split the tables across several databases.p  pKeeping the limitations in mind we are unable to proceed further. Any approach or suggestion by you will be very helpful for us. Thanks in advance.p  pEDIT Thanks a lot to the people answered my question. i got the point 5O GB is a huge space and it would not get filled any time soon. But that brings me a question Consider a situation when the number of schools grow up to 200, 300 or 1000  Then how should be my database design  I suppose 50 GB would not be big at that situation. p
Negative 67617 pIm programming C on an embedded system.  The processor architecture is 32 bits codesizeofintcode is 32 bits, codesizeofshortcode is 16 bits.

Negative 67617 pI have implemented almost the same code in Objectivec, and it runs two to three times faster than it does in Java.  Im trying to figure out which instructions may be the most resource intensive and see if there is a better way of doing the same thing that is more efficient in Java.p  pThis is part of a routine that reads a large resultset from the database, and for each word that is returned, it checks to see if that word can be made from the letter tiles the player has.  It includes support for blank tiles, which can be used as any letter.  A blank tile will be represented by an underscore character.p  pBasically, for each word that is returned from the database, I iterate through each of the letters of the word, and look through the players array of available letters. If I find that letter, I remove it from the players array and keep going.  If I dont find the letter, the word is discarded and the next word read.  Unless, I find an underscore character in the players array, then, Ill use that for the letter, and remove it from the array.  If I get to the end of the database words array of letters and have found each one, then the word is saved in a list.p  pIve already timed various parts of the whole function and the database query happens pretty fast.  It is just the processing of this cursor that is very slow.

The only way I know is to write a C program that interprets the Xml. which doesnt seem like a great solution So how to I go about making a nice human readble form out of an XML document If not with tables then at least with headingsp

Negative 67617 pAllow me to explain a little better.p  pI have a VS2010 Solution, split into 2 projects a WCF Web Service, and a Class Library that uses the Web Service.p  pThe WCF Web Service is a simple logging service namespace LogService, service LogService, contract ILogService.p  pWhen you use the Add Service Reference utility that comes with VS2010 to add a reference to the WCF, into the consuming Class Library project, you will see that the tool correctly adds a reference to a Web Service that can be called through LogService.LogServiceClient. No problem here.p  pNow, I have another Solution this is also split into 2 projects another WCF Web Service, and a Web Application that uses this new Web Service. p  pThis particular Web Service provides operations performed on a database namespace BLService, service BLService, contract IBLService.p  pUsing that very same Add Service Reference utility in this project, however, adds a reference whose client name is actually BLService.IBLServiceClient. Please notice there is a I prepended to the service client class name. The utility seems to have decided it should use the contracts name, instead of the services name, to create the service client class. p  pI dont understand why does the tool behave differently on both Solutions. Ive tried checking everything I could from both, and I cant find no significative differences to my knowledge, at least. p  pDo you people know why does this happen What things should I check, and correct, in my Web project or anywhere else in the solution so this odd behavior does not happen anymorep

I cant get a clear picture of what to do.  The fact that Im installing on a system with a serverthinclient arrangement possibly complicates things.p  pAnyway, I can spend the next few days researching how registry keys work and how they affect AddIns, learning how to make .MSI packages, exactly how certificates work and if I need one to publish or if I can deploy into the Program Files directory, or if that option in the .NET 4.0 framework even applies to a VSTO AddIn, etc., etc., etc.  p  pTheres just a lot of variables and I would appreciate advice that pertains to my exact scenario.  Or, barring that, exactly what subjects I need to study up on to know what to do, and links to them.p  pEdit I need to deploy to 1 user on the server first, for testing, and then eventually all or most of the users, so help for singular and broad deployment would be appreciated.p

Negative 67617 pIm working on an android game, and the concept is quite sound, but im constantly frustrated by outofmemory errors and finding myself spending the majority of my time attempting to avoid them. p  pAs of now, all animation is done in a canvas using png image resources. Im guessing that some of the bigger apps dont quite use this method since much more graphically impressive games than mine exist and run much better.p  pWhere im getting the problems is when I first load the image resources and assign them to variable handles. I load all the images from the very beginning of the app starting in a constructor, and I often hit the outofmemory error at this point usually on devices running android 2.1 more so.p  pSo my question is how can I avoid this or change the way im doing the animation to be easier on memory.p  pRescaling helps temporarily, but is unacceptable as a long term solution, I want the images to look good. And like I said, other apps look good and have much more animation so im sure its possible to do this. p  pThe other option Ive been suggested is to more closely control the object lifecycles to only allocate images when I need them. This doesnt seem to be an ideal solution either because do to the setup of my app, most of the images need to be drawn most of the time, or at least may be called at any time. p  pMy last idea is to possibly add in some code that deallocates the memory when an image is not immediately being used. Again this doesnt seem ideal because in circumstances when for instance there is a single enemy on the canvas, every time his frame changes he would need to reallocate an image for it, killing performance. p  pAnyone have any general ideas I should look into I know im missing something big. Can I manually make the available memory larger Is there a format of image with a smaller memory footprint.p  pIm trying to get a better knowledge of the basics of whats at work here. My entire drawable folder is only 864kb, That seems ridiculous to me. What is happening that makes 864kb worth of images exceed the memory limits Id like to know specifically where the problem is occurring. I need a solution, not a workaround.p  pEdit Ive also noticed that OpenGL seems to be the alternative to canvas Ive been using. Ive never used OpenGL... is this what im looking for and if yes, how difficult would it be to switch from simply drawing to canvas to the equivalent in OpenGL  p

Negative 67617 pIm working on a paint bucket tool for a drawing application.p  pIm using codecontext.getImageDatacode to find out the color values for all the pixels in the canvas.p  pHowever, it seems that by default all the rgba values are 0, even though the canvas is white by default. Now my paint bucket tool doesnt work on shapes outlined with black because black has the rgb code0,0,0code and the default canvas image data does as well, even though the canvas is white.p  pSo my question is whether or not I can change the default image data so that it is reflective of the canvas actual default color white, or, code255,255,255code, or how to quickly clear the canvas to that color. A solution I see being possible but incredibly inefficient is, when clearing the canvas, to set every single pixels values to 255. This causes a couple seconds of lag when performed, though, because of the size of the canvas.p  pAre there any other alternatives that I am overlooking Thanks.p

Negative 67617 pIm trying to accomplish something that I think is quite easy, but Im baffled on how to accomplish it using the PreferenceActivity class and the xml preferenceheader tag.p  pWhen the user taps the app settings icon I would like them to be presented with a small list of checkboxes and lists.  I have only a single preference fragment.  So far I can set up the PreferenceActivity xml files preferences.xml, and preference fragments xmls to show the single header for the preference fragment.  When the user selects that header the preferences screen is exactly how I want it, however, I cannot figure out a way to skip showing the first header screen.p  pIt seems a waste to have to tap the settingspreferences icon, show a single header that is then tapped to get to the actual settingspreferences.p  pI understand how this can be very helpful if you want to categorize your preferences, but for something simple, this adds overhead and seems rather clunky.p  pI hope that I was clear.  In short heres my questionp  pWhat is the new preferred way to use the PreferenceActivity class and preferenceheader tag to simply show a single screen of options with no header p  pAfter looking around some more it looks like I am trying to do what the older methods did in a straightforward manner.  Im trying to do this with without using any of the deprecated functions.p  pThanks in advance, B.p

At the top of the pages is a menu.

But, I can leave the menu links at the top of the page codehttpcode, and theres no problem.p  pSo, am I correct in saying that things that are being emloadedem onto the page, such as style sheets and images, need to have codehttpscode in the link, but that plain old codehrefcode links can just have codehttpcode in themp  pThanks for your advice.p

Negative 67617 pWhat is the best way or options for accessing spring components at layers deep within the application that arent managed by springp  pFor example, say I have some Controllers. Via some layers of abstraction via POJOs that arent managed by spring, those Controllers might end up using a POJO that needs a Service injected into it.p  pOne option would be to make all the layers in to spring components, but that seems like Im hacking my design to force spring to help me. I have some complex things going on that wont be nearly as clean if I have to Autowire everything. Another option might be to manually inject the component in the low level class, but Im not really sure if this is possible or the right solution.p

Negative 67617 pI am working on a quite large existing monothreaded C application.

Moreover, to avoid interference from outside world, I tried as much as possible to launch the application in a system without any other applications running on a side note, because CLOCKPROCESSCPUTIMEID returns process time and not wall clock time, other applications should in theory only affect cache and not directly the process execution timep  pI was suspecting instruction cache effects, maybe the instrumented code that is a little bit larger few bytes fits differently and better in the cache, is this hypothesis conceivable  I tried to do some cache investigations with valegrind toolcachegrind but unfortunately, the instrumented version has as it seems logical more cache misses than the initial version.p  pAny hints on this subject and ideas that may help to find why instrumented code is running faster are welcomes some GCC optimizations available in one case and not in the other, why , ...p

Negative 67617 pHi Im trying to write a media query that will affect all phones but not iPads.p  pIm having a hard time doing so because apparently android devices change their devicewidth as they change orientation.  Portrait to Landscape means the width becomes the height and vice versa.  Apple devices report their device width as the same value regardless of orientation.  The fact that there are android phones with higher resolution than iPads further complicates the issue.p  pIf there is an android phone with a device height of 1280px and iPads have a device height of 1024px, how can I write a media query that will affect all Android phones but not iPadsp

Negative 67617 pYes other people have asked this question before, but not in the same context or to my satisfaction. So, here goesp  pI am writing an application using python, the program using pygame ergo opengl to display the graphics. The graphics are generated in the program itself so no directory issues whatsoever. p  pThe application also needs to access the input parallely from a user. To achieve this I use a multiprocessing block with a pipe and read the input key using pygame event loop. The below code runs in a loop. The first loop iteration works fine, but on the 2nd iteration I am thrown that XIO error.p  precode   parent, child  PipeduplexTrue     this function draws the canvas    switches, retOrient  self.drawCanvascond, count, dispSize, moves     this function gets the user input in another thread  stage 1    p  ProcesstargetuserInput, argsself.button, child     p.start    bpress  parent.recv    parent.close  def userInputbutton, child     buttonpressed  button.blockAndWait     child.send sbuttonpressed.keyname      child.close codepre  pI am a little perplexed at how this error occurs, what are the internals in XIO that cause it. None of the other answers actually explain the root cause of this error. Considering it works fine as a single process application, the multiprocessing module is closing some IO channel the input registered object, the display object or the event loop or opening some unnecessary channels. How can I decipher what exactly is causing this XIO error  p

Negative 67617 pI currently have an issue with Firefox where it receives a cookie with httponly flag. However when a subsequent response is sent to the server the request does not contain any httponly flag which may be correct behaviour, however when the response comes back down it returns the cookie however it does not have the httponly flag attached, as I assume it is returning it in the same state it got it.p  pSo is this correct behaviour should I be manually updating the httponly state of the cookie on the server for each request or should the httponly state be persisted between calls I am sure there may be some different behaviour per browser but just assume modern mainstream browsers.p

Negative 67617 pWhat is the best way to handle missing values in a dimension tablep  pIn the case of a textual column, it is easy to write NA Missing, but what should be done for numeric columns where it is important to retain the strongspecific valuesstrong. Note I do not want a solution that uses banded values e.g., textual columns for 050, 50100, NA Missing.p  pFor instance, a customer dimension may have a yearofbirth. How should missing years of birth be handled Leave it null Add in an arbitrary number as a placeholder such as 1900p  pSometimes, it may be difficult to find a placeholder number. For instance, if salestodate are nonnegative, but can be zero I wouldnt want to put 0 as a placeholder for null. I could use negative values such as 1, but that would ruin queries that use sums.p

Negative 67617 pI have an ASP.NET MVC 4 application, in which Im trying to implement claimsbased authentication and authorization.  We have an SSO proxy that inserts certain info about the user such as username in the header.

Negative 67617 pSorry if it is trivial but I am a very beginner. In Javascript what is the best way to extend an already defined object class with propreties which are classes themselves For example suppose I have a class codeSpritecode with some built in properties and methods. I want to have an extra property codeSprite.positioncode where the codepositioncode part is a class with say two properties codeposition.xcode and codeposition.ycode. And I want it applied all the instances of the class codeSpritecode past and future, not to one single instance. If codepositioncode would be a simple input data number or string then I could just write codeSprite.prototype.positiontherecode. Also if codepositioncode was an array it would have been easy just write codeSprite.prototype.positiontherecode, or even an array of array would work like this... But what if codepositioncode is a class Usually to build classes one would use the object constructorp  precodefunction positionx,y      this.x  x     this.y  y   codepre  pbut then I would need to instantiate the codepositioncode objects with codevar myPosition  new position0,0code  but I want the position object to exist every time I instantiate a new codeSpritecode object. If I write codeSprite.prototype.positionnew position0,0codethan there is a problem if I define codemySprite1.position.x2code the value code2code is also given to the property codeposition.xcode of every istance of the class Sprite. This doesnt happen with the command codeSprite.prototype.positiontherecode, in this case every istance will have and keep his own separate values. I want every istance with separate independent position objects.p  pIs it possible to do what I want in an easy linear wayp

Negative 67617 pWe are using the iPad to make an adhoc wireless connection to our proprietary device. DHCP is not available, so we are using addresses in the AutoIP range. The user selects the device from the list of wireless networks on the iPad and about twenty seconds later, DHCP fails and an AutoIP address is assigned. The device has a fixed IP address of 169.254.20.10.p  pThe problem we are having is that from time to time, the iPad loses its ability to connect with the device. This issue appears to happen much quicker with the iPad 4th generation and iPad Mini. Usually a combination of switching to another wireless network on the iPad and then back to the adhoc network andor turning WiFi off then back on again fixes the issue, but sometimes the iPad needs to be restarted.p  pWhen it gets in this state, the socket errors we receive in our app when we try to unicast to 169.254.20.10 or broadcast to 169.254.255.255 are either Host is down or No route to host. This is confirmed by using an app such as IT Tools to ping the device.p  pAny ideas what might be going on or how we fix this issuep

Negative 67617 pIm working on an application that uses a scroll load system of 20 or so results loading into a feed at a time as you scroll. This feed consists of constantly added user generated content. Which means the result set can change per query that is offset by X.p  pSo lets say we load 20 results, then scroll, another 20, and then before scrolling more to load the next 20, another user has uploaded a new piece of content, which effectively would present a duplicate in the next set of 20 results for the feed because were using OFFSET to get additional results, and the total result set is getting shifted by 1 with this addition of new content that falls into the conditions of the query.p  pWhat is the best and most efficient way around this Weve dabbled with using the id of a row in a where condition to prevent duplicate results, and only using limit without offset for new results fetched.. so we could do WHERE id lt 170 LIMIT 20, WHERE id lt 150 LIMIT 20, WHERE id lt 130 LIMIT 20, etc.. to control and prevent duplciates... HOWEVER, this does not work in every possible scenario as our result sets arent always ordered with the id column ordered by DESC..p  pSoo.. what other options are there..p

Negative 67617 pstrongBackgroundstrong  Lets suppose for the sake of argument that you have 100,000 views partials.  Lets also suppose you have accompanying viewscoped controllers, and potentially viewscoped services and filters as well.  Try to envision an aggregating application that hosts 100,000 disparate small applications. p  pstrongIssuestrong  When you have partials that require accompanying controllers, the typical solution is to do something like thisp  precoderouteProvider.whenapp1,          templateUrl partialsview1.html,         controller controller1      codepre  pThe controller is typically loaded from index.html viap  precodeltscript srcjsdirectivesController1.jsgtltscriptgt codepre  pThe problem with this approach is that it doesnt scale.  There are solutions out there for dynamically loading controllers, but they still require adding touch points in various config.p  pstrongIdeal Solutionstrong  Ideally  again for very small applications whose numbers are in the 000s, the controller could be loaded dynamically, and from within the partial itself.  This would alleviate the need to manage several files and several configuration touch points not to mention network requests, and keep each partial very well contained.p  pstrongIt would look something like thisstrongp  pIn routerp  precoderouteProvider.whenappsappId,          templateUrl partialsappframe.html,         controller AppCtrl      codepre  pIn containing html appframe include the relatively disparate mini appp  precodelth1gtCurrently hosting appIdlth1gtlthrgt ltdiv classnginclude appUrlgtltdivgt codepre  pIn partial resolved with appUrl, define controller strongandstrong markup in onep  precodeltscriptgt   myApp.controllercontroller1, [scope, function scope      scope.foo  bar   ] ltscriptgt   ltdiv ngcontrollercontroller1gt      foo ltdivgt codepre  pFor cases like this, where there are a lot of partials and a 11 mapping for controller and view, it can make sense to couple the two for development efficiencies and maintenance.  Its a lot cleaner than using several files and additional configuration touch points.p  pThe problem is, this doesnt work.  It could be as simple as forcing the script to load prior to applying the directive... but not sure how to do thatp  pstrongHere are some similar explanations of the problemstrongp  pa hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicangularH4haaMePJU0httpsgroups.google.comforumtopicangularH4haaMePJU0ap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12987001loadingpartialpagewithangularandcompilethecontrollerLoading Partial Page With Angular and Compile The Controllerap  pstrongIgor from the AngularJS team saysstrongp  precodeI see.. we looked into supporting script tags in jqlite, but what needs to be done to get a crossbrowser support involves a lot of black magic.

Negative 67617 pSo Im coding a calendar from the jQuery UI datepicker and this renewing of instance thing is driving me insane.p  pThe goal is to fill the calendar with events from a normal table, with the correct information Date is given within the table it works fine. It populates the calendar with events and you can drag and drop them to update the table with correct information. All this is done.p  pHOWEVER I want too be able to click on a date, and create a event for the specific date selected, this is easy. However when I click all the previous events get removed because the instance of the Calendar is refreshed. Its really hard to explain.p  pThe function initialize is what gives every TD in the calendar a UL for dragndrop with correct date attr, and populates the UL with LIs from an external table.p  pSo if I dop  precodedatepicker.datepicker      firstDay 1, MonSun     onSelect function  initialize   codepre  pNothing happens.. But if i do itp  precodedatepicker.datepicker      firstDay 1, MonSun     onSelect function  initializealert   codepre  pYou can actually see the calendar being populated correctly, the alert prevents code from going further, but when pressing OK the calendar instance is refreshed and events are gone.p  pSo what Id need is an kind of afterNewInstanceCreated command to work from..

Negative 67617 pIn my SSAS cube I have a dimension with attributes A and B, and I want both to be displayed in the sort order specified by a third attribute C. If I specify C as the OrderByAttribute for A and reprocess the cube, then A is sorted correctly. p  pIf I then specify C as the OrderByAttribute for B as well and reprocess the cube, then A continues to be sorted correctly but B does not. Values of B are displayed in an order that seems arbitrary. I have triplechecked that there is no difference in the way A and B are configured.p  pIs there some conceptual reason why two attributes in a single dimension cannot be both sorted by the same third attributep

Negative 67617 pIm developing a game via Andengine and Im stuck somewhere The problem is It is adding a sprite where I touch on scenetouchX, touchY and one sprite is adding at touchX100, touchY. These two sprites always have 100px between eact other on x axis. Untill now, I touch one time and added two sprites on scene.

Negative 67617 pI have a database that has a form that generates an ID for a particular set of information in MS Access Database. This ID is meant to be the current date and a random 6 digit number. Currently I have the date field with a default of codeDatecode and the random number field with a default of this codeRightFormatRnd1000000,000000,6code to get the 6 digits, then I use this code[DateRequested] amp  amp [RandomNumber]code in the ID field to get a concatenated version of the fields with a dash in the center. Both are working correctly, but when I close and reopen the database I am getting the same progression of numbers. I have seen a little on here about issuing a codeRandomizecode statement in the code, but I am not very good at code and do not know how to implement this.p  pI tried doing this this from what I could put together from threadsp  precodePrivate Sub FormLoad Randomize End Sub codepre  pbut I get this error messagep  blockquote   pCompile error Expected p blockquote  pI just need to know what I need to change in order to get the database to pull a new 6 digit number every time the database is opened, rather then the same set of numbers every time.p
Negative 67617 pI have a some python code that occasionally needs to span a new process to run a shell script in a fire and forget manner, ie without blocking. The shell script will not communicate with the original python code, and will in fact probably terminate the calling python process, so the launched shell script cannot be a child process of the calling python process. I need it to be launched as an independent process. p  pIn other words, lets say I have mycode.py and that launches script.sh. Then mycode.py will continue processing without blocking. The script script.sh will do some things independently, and will then actually stop and restart mycode.py. So the process that runs script.py must be completely independent of mycode.py. How exactly can I do this I think subprocess.Popen will not block but will still create a child process that terminates as soon as mycode.py stops, which is not what I want.p

All kinds of aligns should be supported  left, right, top, bottom, horizontal center, vertical center or even evenly spaced. To reduce the amount of duplicated code, I came up with the solution to implement class codeDirectioncode, which can be horizontal and vertical and works in the Facadeish mode with regards to the codeElementcode. It this is passed as an attribute to the aligning function. Similarly, I am handling the leftrightmiddle and distribute evenly distinction, but to keep it simple, lets ignore it here.p  pHere is the class.p  precodeDirection  functionselector      this.selector  selector   Direction.prototype.get  functionelement      return parseIntelement.style[this.selector]   Direction.prototype.set  functionelement, value      element.style[this.selector]  value  px  codepre  pHere are the constants available to the client.p  precodeDirection.VERTICAL  new Directionleft Direction.HORIZONTAL  new Directiontop codepre  pHere is the public method performing the minimal align left or top.p  precodealignMin  functionelements, direction      var min  Number.MAXVALUE     for var i  0 i lt elements.length i          min  Math.minmin, direction.getelements[i]          for var i  0 i lt elements.length i          direction.setelements[i], min       codepre  pAnd the client here demonstrates the intended use.p  precodealignDivsToLeft  function      alignMindocument.getElementsByTagNamediv, Direction.VERTICAL  codepre  pWorking example on a JSFiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net7Tpam relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.net7Tpamap  pstrongQuestion againstrong All this works, I was just wondering, if instead of codeDirection.getcode and codeDirection.setcode methods I could do something a reference to a value to directly access the proxified attribute, so the codealignMincode function could use just p  precode... min  Math.minmin, direction.value      possibly with parseInt ... codepre  pandp  precode... direction.value  min                     possibly with  px ... codepre  pIf there is a simple solution for this, it would be a shorter, clearer and more elegant way, especially in cases with more attributes position, dimension, ....

Negative 67617 pI have the following problemp  pIm using a SQL Server CE 4.0 DB to store data. The database file can be located on any computer in a private network and should be accessible by multiple client computers from the same network. If one user loads an object from the database to modify it, this object should be locked against access by other clients until the owner saves and thereby releases an object. p  pSo my simplified DB looks like thisp  pTable codeprojectscodep  precodeint ProjectID           string SomeValue            bool IsLocked        01                    Value1                       false       02                    Value2                        true ... ... codepre  pand so onp  pIt works fine so far, but if a client computer crashes while editing an object, this object will be locked forever. To avoid this I could think of several approachesp  ul liIf a user wants to open a locked object, hes given the chance to unlock it, so he can unlock an object which he knows is not to be locked.li liSwitch from SQL Server CE to a proper DB and manage connections and locks by server programming or use of triggers. This would afford to install a DB Server which I want to avoid. Only the application should be installed on cutsomers systems. The place of the DB shall be chosen with a simple filechoser.li liMy favorite a client modifying an object has to actively contact the DB in a fixed timespan to maintain the lock. To implement this, I added a column to the DB in which a client who locks an object writes a timestamp every five minutes. Then, if another client wants to edit a locked object which timestamp is older then five minutes, he is allowed to do so, for the lock is invalid. Problem is All clients have to use the same time.li ul  pMy questionsp  ul liIs there a way to let the SQL Server CE database determine a reference time Like the time on the machine its running onli liDoes anyone know another way of locking objectstable rows Maybe there is same buildin functionality in SQL Server CE or in the EF6 which I useli ul

Negative 67617 pIve been trying to pin down an annoying performance bug in my C 2d game engine.p  pIt only occurs when I have sound enabled, and I am trying to figure out what I am doing wrong. I suspect multiple things, since the sound functionality was implemented quite a while ago to achieve basic functionality. At this stage in development it is now a higher priority. I need to resolve it.p  pWhen I implemented sound it was after much experimentation with sound APIs. I tried SoundPlayer, MediaPlayer, and WindowsMediaPlayer  with the latter the only one I could get working in an acceptable manner.p  pMy implementation was based around setting up an array of players for each sound I wanted to play. They are all instantiated upfront. The method by which they are used isp  ol lipSearch through player array until you find one which isnt currently playing.pli lipPlay the sound.pli ol  pNow for some reason, which I cant figure out, this implementation is causing a wierd problem. I have a method which fires when you die, and from what I can tell this does NOTHING with sound whatsoever. It basically waits 5 seconds before restarting the game. But with sound on the screen flickers for a millisecond, something in sharpdevelop refreshes, and its as if there is a sudden lag in the game. From a functionality point of view I dont have a problem   but the performance is unacceptable.p  pTo give you an idea of what Im doing, here is some code from my sound initialisation methodp  precode                ifsoundLibraryWindowsMediaPlayer                                    Music player                 WMPMusic  new WMPLib.WindowsMediaPlayer                 WMPMusic.settings.autoStart  false                 WMPMusic.URL  DProgrammingSFXMUSICINGAME1.wav                   Array of players                  WMPEATENGHOSTArray  new WMPLib.WindowsMediaPlayer[EATENGHOSTnoOfPlayers]                 WMPEATENPILLArray  new WMPLib.WindowsMediaPlayer[EATENPILLnoOfPlayers]                 WMPEATENPOWERPILLArray  new WMPLib.WindowsMediaPlayer[EATENPOWERPILLnoOfPlayers]                 WMPKILLEDBYGHOSTArray  new WMPLib.WindowsMediaPlayer[KILLEDBYGHOSTnoOfPlayers]                      forint i0iltWMPEATENGHOSTArray.Lengthi                                      WMPEATENGHOSTArray[i]  new WMPLib.WindowsMediaPlayer                     WMPEATENGHOSTArray[i].settings.autoStart  false                     WMPEATENGHOSTArray[i].URL  DProgrammingSFXEATENGHOSTHit55.wav                       WMPEATENPILLArray[i]  new WMPLib.WindowsMediaPlayer                     WMPEATENPILLArray[i].settings.autoStart  false                     WMPEATENPILLArray[i].URL  DProgrammingSFXEATENPILLHit43s.wav                       WMPEATENPOWERPILLArray[i]  new WMPLib.WindowsMediaPlayer                     WMPEATENPOWERPILLArray[i].settings.autoStart  false                     WMPEATENPOWERPILLArray[i].URL  DProgrammingSFXEATENPOWERPILLHit49.wav                       WMPKILLEDBYGHOSTArray[i]  new WMPLib.WindowsMediaPlayer                     WMPKILLEDBYGHOSTArray[i].settings.autoStart  false                     WMPKILLEDBYGHOSTArray[i].URL  DProgrammingSFXKILLEDBYGHOSTHit55.wav                   codepre  pSo with these set up, heres the code which plays the soundp  precode        public void PlayPCMWindowsMediaPlayerFXstring effectIn              int i1         bool found  false          ifsoundEnabled                      switcheffectIn                              case KILLEDBYGHOST                      1.

Negative 67617 pI found a VB script in an Excel file that implements RungeKutta integration for solving a differential equation. I converted the implementation line by line to Javscript. However, the Javascript program does not yield the exact same results as the VB one... The numbers are close enough to be marginally acceptable, but I trust that the VB implementation is correct as it was part of a PhD Dissertation. So this leads me to believe that my Javascript implementation, running on NodeJS, suffers from some rounding ghosts.p  pIn particular, I have noticed that as I continually add code0.01code to my time counter, the values are eventually unable to be represented properly, and I get values like code5.299999999999999934code instead of code5.3code. This makes sense to me, as I have read about this quirk of Javascript in some books.p  pstrongMy Questions Arestrongp  pIs my observation correct that Visual Basic does not suffer from this same precision shortcomingp  pDoes this mean plain vanilla Javascript math is inherently less accurate than plain vanilla VB math Without using other math libraries.p  pIf I clamp my time variable, as in, force the value to be 5.30, instead of 5.299999999, will this actually make my results more correctp  pedit Using a codeMath.roundX100100code clamp changes the output of all my time values to have only 2 decimal places, but does not actually change the values of any computations.p

However, with different sized fonts and header tags here and there, this doesnt work well.p  pI think I just misunderstood what it is that the codegtcode selector does, but what Im trying to look for is a selector that styles an element, without applying said style to children elements.

Negative 67617 pSome organizations have automated their telephone system so that messages can be sent via pushing the buttons on the telephone. The buttons are labeled with both numerals and letters as shownp  pNotice that certain letters are omitted, presumably for historical reasons. However, it is common to use  to represent letter q and  to represent letter z. Common schemes do not use a onetoone encoding of each letter. However, if we wanted such an encoding, one method would be to use two digits for each letter The first digit is the key containing the letter. The second digit is the index, 1, 2, or 3, of the letter on the key. For example, to send the word cat, wed punch 2 3 2 1 8 1 c a t An exception would be made for q and z, as the only letters on the keys  and  respectively. Give the dfa for communicating a series of any of the twentysix letters, where the input alphabet is the set of digits 1, ...., 9, ,  and the output alphabet is the set of available letters. Note that outputs occur only every other input. So we need a convention for what output will be shown in the transducer in case there is no output. Use  for this output.p

Negative 67617 pIn Ada, a hrefhttpen.wikibooks.orgwikiAdaProgrammingObjectOrientationPrimitiveoperations relnofollowPrimitive operationsa of a type T can only be defined in the package where T is defined. For example, if a codeVehiculescode package defines codeCarcode and codeBikecode tagged record, both inheriting a common codeVehiclecode abstract tagged type, then all operations than can dispatch on the classwide codeVehicleClasscode type must be defined in this codeVehiclescode package.p  pLets say that you do not want to add primitive operations you do not have the permission to edit the source file, or you do not want to clutter the package with unrelated features.p  pThen, you cannot define operations in emotherem packages that implicitely dispatches on type codeVehicleClasscode. For example, you may want to serialize vehicles define a codeVehiclesXMLcode package with a codeToXmlcode dispatching function or display them as UI elements define a codeVehiclesGTKcode package with codeGetLabelcode, codeGetIconcode, ... dispatching functions, etc. The only way to perform dynamic dispatch is to write the code explicitely for example, inside codeVechicleXMLcode p  precodeif V in CarClass then    return CarXML Car V else    if V in BikeClass then       return BikeXML Bike V    else       raise ConstraintError           with VehicleXML is only defined for Car and Bike. end if codepre  pAnd a Visitor pattern defined in codeVehiclescode and used elsewhere would work, of course, but that still requires the same kind of explicit dispatching code. emeditem in fact, no, but there is still some boilerplate code to writep  pMy question is thenp  pstrongis there a reason why operations dynamically dispatching on T are restricted to be defined in the defining package of Tstrong p  pIs this intentional Is there some historical reasons behind thisp  pThanksp  hr  pEDITp  pThanks for the current answers basically, it seems that it is a matter of language implementation freezing rulesvirtual tables.p  pI agree that compilers are developped incrementally over time and that not all features fit nicely in an existing tool. As such, isolating dispatching operators in a unique package seems to be a decision mostly guided by existing implementations than by language design. Other languages outside of the CJava family provide dynamic dispatch without such requirement e.g. OCaml, Lisp CLOS  if that matters, those are also emcompiledem languages, or more precisely, language for which compilers exist.p  pWhen I asked this question, I wanted to know if there were more fundamental reasons, at language specification level, behind this part of Ada specifications otherwise, does it really mean that the emspecificationem assumesenforces a particular implementation of dynamic disapatchp  pIdeally, I am looking for an authoritative source, like a emrationaleem or emguidelineem section in Reference Manuals, or any kind of archived discussion about this specific part of the language.p

Negative 67617 pI am currently working on a trading card game in the very early phase of it. I have a question about how to approach the database schema, excuse my terminology if Im misusing it.p  pA little back ground on how it will be used. The client is coded in Unity3d and all commands will be passed to a server via php. The php will handle and logical functions for the game. This in theory should significantly reduce cheating. The server returns the state of the game back the client which displays the results to the user.p  pI am somewhat familiar with SQL and I am using MySQL for the database. I have read things about scalability issues with it. Im not too concerned with it as I have no disillusions about have thousands of players and besides if it does Ill worry about that then.p  pMy abridged database structure is as followsp  precodeusers gt userIDunique device ID , name card gt cardID, name, type, cost, image, rarity, attack, defense, description tag gt tagID, name, description ability gt abilityID, name cardtag gt cardID, tagID cardability gt cardID, abilityID codepre  pI not sure how to structure the database for saving each individual users info. I do at least know, or believe I do, what I require. The database should save each card they user has and what deck its currently in. Im thinking of allowing 3 decks and an individual card may be apart of none or more of them. The cards themselves will be able to gain exp and levels. Also upon leveling up the cards stats and abilities may change. When a card levels up the users will be presented with different options to enhance it. So two of the same card leveled differently will have slight differences, example one will have 1 attack the other may have 1 defense. p  pI was thinking a solution would to be create a table for each user to contain their card with the card experience, level, decks membership, and other things that are unique to it contained there. I can see this getting possibly getting out of hand.p  pAnother possibility would be to have a very large table containing card instances and reference the user in it as well.p  pIm sure there are other approaches as well, but you dont know what you dont know. Any help is very much appreciatedp  pEdit The players will be able to take the cards they have and assign them into decks for grouping. A deck will consist of 60 or so cards, it will be the cards used while in gameplay. A small example a user has cards A,B,C,D,E, and 2x of F. Deck one consists of cards A, B, C and F. Deck two of B, C, D, and F. While deck three consists of A,B, D, and 2x F. p

Negative 67617 pHaving a number of problems with this sorting. Im trying to sort by name, but strcmp is not behaving the way that I believed it to. TextArt is just an array of structs, I made sure the values are properly stored. So I believe the problem lies with how I am passing the values to strcmp.

If as Steven V below says, the client app cookie is created by the httpmodule  how does any page get authenticated For example if I am in my client RP app page landing.aspx, say and click a link to the IP authentication server to restricted content restricted.aspx, say  how does the server magically create a cookie on the client before it redirects to restricted.aspx after logging me in. Using WIF Id still have to do a codeFormsAuthentication.CreateAuthCookiecode or similar in code. p  pWhat is happening if I click on the link to my restricted page, is that I am redirected to the IP CAS server pages as expected, and after sucessful login get an infinite redirect, because presumably the app does not have a local client cookie and tries to authenticate, so redirects to the server which has already authenticated and redirects back to the client, which does not have a local cookie, so needs to authenticate.. forever.p  pstrongEdit againstrong I have read further on this there is not much available out there and found that this authentication happens at a very low level and is supposed to happen on the client app RP setting the cookie before the page redirect. This clearly is not happening for me, and I have no clue as to how to go about working out what is going wrong.p

Negative 67617 pI need some help with a python script. It is the Penn Phonetics Audio Aligner.

However, the compiler spit out a message saying that extended initializer lists are not available..., which tells me that I botched the code such that the compiler doesnt even recognize my structure type as a structure otherwise it would accept my list of three values.br Ive just today learned of arrays, structures, pointers, and dynamic allocation of variables, and when it comes to arrays of structures statically assigned, and structures and arrays dynamically assigned separately, I completed the exercises on the first try but dynamicallyassigned arrays of structures are giving me copious grief. Please help.p

Negative 67617 pI know that when dealing with polymorphism in Java, you can have a different declared type for an object than the object type. For example p  precode    Parent foo  new Child  codepre  pI mostly see it when the declared type is an interface such asp  precode    MapltInteger,BigIntegergt memo  new TreeMapltInteger,BigIntegergt     codepre  pI see this a lot in peoples Java code. What is the benefit of declaring foo as a Parent when it is a Child object I also understand that if we do this, foo can no longer call any methods that are not declared abstract or defined in Parent. What puzzles me is I see this done when we can have both the declared and actual type Child and still pass as an argument to methods which require a Parent parameter object. For examplep  precode    Child fooNew  new Child     public void showObjParent o         System.out.printlno      showObjfooNew codepre  pemSo what givesem In what circumstance would it be beneficial to have different declared and actual types for an object My book says its important for generic programming but doesnt explain. I see it consistently used but with no clue why. And it even seems to have some drawbacks of its own.  p
Negative 67617 pI have created a smal incident management tool in OneNote 2010. Im looking for a way to be able to extract stats from it. All my pages under 2 sections are build up on a template and have sames fields.p  pNow I was looking on exporting my NoteBook in access but I have so many images and files inserted in my pages that I can find a way. Excel is realy not a good format for my incident and file would be way to big.p  pIm the only one using this tool could be used by other but not nesseracy.  Cannot install or request for a real incident program like Chorus Remedy or other.p  pIm looking for an idea in order to be able to provide stats to my boss such as how many tickets I have created within the month, how many are resolved, list of user etc....

Negative 67617 pI am using Visual Studio Professional 2013 Update 3 and I have created a Node console Application with the hello world log instruction. If I set a breakpoint in this instruction and then I run the debugger, it works perfectly fine. It hits the breakpoint and then I can debug as expected just to make clear that my .map files are created and working correctly.p  pNow, I clean the project remove the app.js and app.js.map generated files. I edit the .njsproj file and I addp  precodeltTypeScriptOutDirgtlibltTypeScriptOutDirgt codepre  pI open the project again, update the startup file path by adding the additional lib folder and I start debugging. It runs the code but it does not hit the breakpoint.p  pWhy is not hitting the breakpoint How the Visual Studio hit detection is working for typescript node.js projects since no .pdb files have been created when compiling And how can I fix that so I can debug a compiled code that its not located at the same folder as my source filesp  pAny suggestion, idea, feedback will be really appreciated. Thank you.p  pNotep  pChecking the .js.map file generated in lib I can see how the .ts file reference has an additional .. So the reference is alright.

Negative 67617 pI need your help.p  pI am trying to implement a paint system with livetracking, you may think Livetracking What do you meanp  pSo I am implementing a solution to track each touch movement on the display, so I can decide, if I want to paint on a specific spot or not, this decision must be in realtime, right when the user touches the display.p  pThere will be some images where the user should paint the inner white space inside of the respective shape figure 1 shows an example of this shape.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comInTZa.png altFigure 1p  pThe user should paint the inside of the shape in a specific directionorder I still dont know how I can configure this orderdirection in the image.

The arrows are there just to show the right direction of drawing.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgYWd9.png altFigure 3p  pIts not just about direction, the specific spots on the image matter, there will be different types of images, and I cant use only the direction.p  pHow can I determine the specific spots in an image with a specific order to be paintedp  pThe only idea that came to my mind, would be some kind of training mode, where I the developer would draw the image with the order I want, and the system behind would create virtual points on the code, with a small distance between each of them. Then I would have an array with all the spots saved with the order I draw them, do you understandp  pI dont know if this will work, and if it will be fast enough to travel my array of spots when the user is trying to draw on the image Because I want this to work on realtime, the system should check if its a valid spot to draw right when the user touches the displayp  pDo you think it will work Do you have some recommendations about this What are the best structures and stuff like that I am not asking for written code, I just need some guidelines.p  pI think I explained my problem well, if you have any question please ask me.p  pThank you very much in advancep

Negative 67617 pI have developed an application with the new codeLaunchImage.xibcode feature of Xcode 6. This LaunchImage is simply a blank view with the color of the upcoming rootViewController.

For that kind of application start I would like to show an alternate LaunchImage which informs the user that the file is being processed.p  pWhat I have seen so far is that I can only have one codeLaunchImage.xibcode and there is no way to work with a custom class to execute some code in appDelegate such as simply showinghiding some labels on that screen.p  pAre there any ideas on how I can accomplish thisp

Negative 67617 pI was reading up on C Image class. This class is abstract.

Negative 67617 pSo I am having a problem figuring out how to convert a word that the user input into a int array that has each of the letters of the word in their own unicode values so something like A would turn into 65 in the array.

The problem is that I am lost on where to go. I am not sure how I would split the word up into separate chars, and then have those chars be converted, and go into an int array. Any help is greatly appreciated Also just as I side note I need to be able to find the maximum, minimum, and average of all the values as well.p

Negative 67617 pI am new to Rails and am trying to put together a little app that will read cucumber results from a mongo database.  The results stored in the document are parsed into html. In the rails app I am taking those results and displaying them using the raw method call.  The string that I get back is fairly large and as it turns out, the raw method is truncating the text that I pass into it. When I output the text without raw I get the entire string as expected except that it has been escaped and not rendering as html.p  pMy question is, is there any way to get around this  I really dont want to have to do the html conversion in the rails app or on the client. Both seem too costly.  Especially when I can do it elsewhere and just store it in monogdb as an html string.  Anyone have any ideasp  pThanks,p  pJakep

Negative 67617 pSuppose that I create TSQL SELECT statement in a WHILE loop say to iterate over year records.  I have a total count of records in the SELECT, and a count of a subset of records matching certain criteria.  Each loop iteration is added to a temp table as a new record.  p  pCan I use a COUNT total and a subtotal to calculate a percentage strongemwithin the same SELECTemstrong  This would require the order of evaluation in the SELECT to be deterministic  that is, first appearing is first evaulated.  Examplep  precodeWHILE yr lt CurrYr BEGIN      INSERT INTO tmpMatchestotalct, matchct, pctmatch, yr                               some other fields                                      SELECT COUNT AS totalct,             SUMIIFcd.ismatched  1, 1, 0 AS matchct,              CASE                 WHEN totalct gt 0                     THEN tmpmatchct  1.0                              tmptotalct  1.0  100                     ELSE 0               END              AS pctmatch,              yr         FROM candidate cd             INNER JOIN  ...         WHERE  ...            AND YEARclosingdt  yr    SET yr  yr  1  ... END  while codepre  pIf I couldnt rely on the evaluation order, it seems to me that Id have to have a similar SELECT statement preceding this one, in order to get the overall total and subset before running the statement shown above.p  pIn any case, is there a clearer, more SQLlike way to get this resultp
Negative 67617 pEarlier there was one Wicket Application with two databases say Database A and Database B. Now the problem is Database A is maintained by one client and database B is maintained by anotherSay an associated child company . Due to some problem they decided to split and the entire code was reused by Client B which connected to only Database B and Client A connected to only Database A.  Now the problem is they do not want the customer to know the split. So is there a way where one wicket application say Wicket A can extract data from another wicket application B in some way. Does wicket provide any services or provisions for this I tried to search the entire net but was not able to find an exact answer.p  pThe closest i got was this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6599892howcanireusecodewhentwodifferentwicketapplicationssharecommonfunctioHow can I reuse code when two different wicket applications share common functionalitya but it talks about reusing the code. But I do not want to reuse anything. They would run as two different application, have two different Svn resource and so on.p  pWe are using wicket 1.5 and Spring.p
Negative 67617 pI am interested in what is the correct way to write functions with optional arguments in R. Over time, I stumbled upon a few pieces of code that take a different route here, and I couldnt find a proper official position on this topic.p  pUp until now, I have written optional arguments like thisp  precodefooBar lt functionx,yNULL   ifis.nully x lt xy   returnx  fooBar3  3 fooBar3,1.5  4.5 codepre  pThe function simply returns its argument if only codexcode is supplied. It uses a default codeNULLcode value for the second argument and if that argument happens to be not codeNULLcode, then the function adds the two numbers.p  pAlternatively, one could write the function like this where the second argument needs to be specified by name, but one could also codeunlistzcode or define codez lt sum...code insteadp  precodefooBar lt functionx,...   z lt list...   ifis.nullzy x lt xzy   returnx  fooBar3  3 fooBar3,y1.5  4.5 codepre  pPersonally I prefer the first version. However, I can see good and bad with both. The first version is a little less prone to error, but the second one could be used to incorporate an arbitrary number of optionals.p  pIs there a correct way to specify optional arguments in R So far, I have settled on the first approach, but both can occasionally feel a bit hacky.p

Negative 67617 pIve inherited a .NET webforms dashboard application that runs off of a nontransactional SQL Server 2012 reporting database.p  pThe reporting database takes 6 hours to build. Often this happens overnight when no users access the frontend. However, we have some new use cases which necessitate build during business operating hours, while users are trying to access the system.p  pWhile the database is still building, the data on the frontend is inaccurate.p  pI need a solution which enables me to have 2 separate databases  codebuildcode and codeservecode. The application should connect to codeservecode. The databases should change roles dynamically  i.e. in build iteration k1, codebuildcode becomes codeservecode and vice versa. This will allow one static unchanging database to serve users in the morning while the latest database is building. As soon as it finishes building, the latest database becomes the serving one.p  pWhat is the best way to achieve this using these technologiesp  pIve considered 4 options so far and would like some feedback from the community before prototyping the implementations.

Negative 67617 pI have an update query that has an inner join.

In this example that I have, I only cared if the value was YES because I only need to know if the customer bought a specific product.

Negative 67617 pI am working with neo4j and in order to implement a JPA style lazyloading, I came across a solution that uses aspect to prefetch full objects from neo4j when getters of the domain model are called.p  pIn an attempt to implement this solution I have built a small Maven project with a minimalistic domain model and an aspect that should fire when getters are calledp  precodehttpsgithub.comsamuelkerrienneo4jaspectautofetching codepre  pFor some reasons the Aspect is initialising but the advice doesnt seem to get executed. To reproduce the issue, just run the following JUnit testp  precodeplayground.neo4j.domain.UserTest codepre  pHaving not worked extensively with aspects before, I am suspecting I may have poorly configured the project in Maven.

Negative 67617 pIm writing a crossplatform text parser that, among other things, word wraps text so that another crossplatform program which I dont control can properly render the text in a variablelength font. Word wrapping requires getting the pixelwidth of the text, but width varies depending on which OS I run my program on. The following code, for example, says the word Wings has length 31 on OS X 10.10, but on Windows XP, it says 30.p  precodefrom Tkinter import Tk import tkFont  root  Tk font  tkFont.FontfamilyTimes New Roman, size12  Note the negative value of size, showing the font size is the same. print font.measureWings codepre  pThis means that text wrapped on one platform wont be displayed properly when the other program is run on the other platform. If I word wrap on XP and display on OS X, the text that I wrapped assuming it was 30 pixels is now 31 pixels. That one extra pixel could cause an error in how the wrapped text displays on the other program, and that was from just one word. Longer words cause more pixel differences, which makes the word wrapper less accurate.p  pIm aware that the Tkinter widths should be different because the different OSs render the font differently. Since the font Im using in my actual program is wider in Windows than OS X, Id like to have Tkinter use the Windows measurement, even if Im on OS X. This seems to be the only way to get a crossplatform font measurement that doesnt risk word wrapping too late. How can I go about doing this If I cant, how else could I get a crossplatform width measurement thats consistent, reasonably accurate, and not too smallp  pstrongEDITstrong The program that reads the output of my program expects a string of text for it to display, and I cannot control how it displays it, or convince it to accept an image. The only thing I can control is that string.p

When I click the delete button on the dialog, it doesnt close the dialog I know how to do this no worries but when I do add the functionality to close the dialog it will still show the event I previously deleted. Therefore I want to refresh my page because when I do that the event is gone seeing as they are rendered from my getlogs and read straight from the database so it will no longer show the event that has already been deleted, I tried a couple of things to get this to workp  pIn the jquery dialog function for the delete button I addedp  precode window.location.reload and later location.reload codepre  pThis does reload my page however, it somehow breaks off my post to the remove function.p  pIn my controller I added p  precodereturn Redirectroutecalendar codepre  pto return to the calendar page, this didnt redirect me but the post still works so at least it didnt break anythingp  pI also triedp  precodereturn Redirectback codepre  pseeing as this worked for my other post where I create a log difference here was that that post was created using a form submit, this didnt work eitherp  pI am wondering if anyone has any ideas of how I can make this happen with the current setup I have without changing too much of the code its taken me ages to get everything to work and document how I did it and I wouldnt want to rewrite any of that p

Negative 67617 pI have been working on this on and off for the last two months, and despite how many times I look at it, I cant make it work. This script checks daily log files for a user defined variable, so they dont have to look through every one manually. It worked great checking the current month, but if the user wants to check back 20 days, and today is the 12th of this month, I wanted to be able to then go back to the previous month not look for the log file with a date of 20150399 and so on. I have checked the logic for my dateday computations, and they seem okay if there is a better way to do that in BASH, I am open to suggestions. What happens when I try to debug is unexpected end of file. I am somewhat new to writing scripts that contain more than 20 or so lines, but I just cant come up with what I am missing. I have tried various fixes, to no avail, but I think this is the last iteration. Ideasp  precodebinbash   multilogchk.sh  This script will take input from the user and report which  CyberFusion MFT logs contain what the user is looking for.

I use tons of functions in order to make a minirpg game for that peculiar website. brbr For example, a button closer and a button maker. Both are functions the button maker uses code.appendcode to make some buttons to the games UI, and the button closer uses code.removecode to remove those buttons. Then, I use code.onclick,function code code to bind codeonClickcode to some buttons. The functions also include a bunch of other functions with buttons to go back to a previous function and etc.brbr Unfortunately, it seems they loop between themselves endlessly.

The problem with it is that its a bit nastyp  ul liI have to create new message types e.g. codeGetCacheEntryResultcode for each response sent back to the requester, which will quickly bloat the code andli liEach time one actor responds to another, all of the emcontext variablesem that are in scope likely need to be bundled up and sent back to the requesting actor as sidecars, so that they are available to the requester when they receive the answer and need to continue processing see codebuzzcode below. In a more complicated orchestration between emseveralem actors, this context map is going to get fairly big andli liAt the end of the day, this solution just emfeelsem like code smell to me...li ul  pSo I ask strongis there a better way to do this in Akka Maybe using codeFuturescode or the codeask...code methodstrongp

Negative 67617 pI have been scouring the internet for some time now trying to figure out how to send data from C which will read an input .txt file to an Arduino. Because there does not seem to be a native way in Arduino to read files directly, I chose to use C to read the file and then send it over to the Arduino. The primary method of doing this seems to be communicating via Serial. So my question is thisp  blockquote   pHow do you communicate to Serial in C using an OS X device and subsequently read it in Arduino Further, are there other, simpler methods of transferring data to Arduino via C or natively in Arduinop blockquote
Negative 67617 pI have a storyboard with Autolayout and Size Classes. Pretty complicated layout, and unfortunately I cant really pin down how to reproduce the problem in a new project.br But the view in question is pinned to the left and right edge of the screen with a constraint that has 750 priority i.e. code0750[myView]0750code, additionally it emhas a greater or equalem than constraint with a priority of 1000 i.e. codegt0[myView]gt0code. That is done to limit the width on an iPad, so there is a width constraint of codewidth lt 600 1000code, and a emcenter horizontal in containerem constraint as well. On top of that the view has a aspect ratio constraint of 31. As I said, rather complicated. p  pInterface Builder doesnt show any problems with the constraints. The Xcode layout preview renders correct for all devices.p  pWhen I run the app iOS tells me that it has conflicting constraints. p  precodeUnable to simultaneously satisfy constraints.     Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you dont want. Try this 1 look at each constraint and try to figure out which you dont expect 2 find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it. Note If youre seeing NSAutoresizingMaskLayoutConstraints that you dont understand, refer to the documentation for the UIView property translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints       ltNSLayoutConstraint0x7fd72853ff80 DMXKit.DipSwitchAssembly0x7fd72990d0e0.width  3DMXKit.DipSwitchAssembly0x7fd72990d0e0.heightgt,     ltNSLayoutConstraint0x7fd728574e50 UITemporaryLayoutWidth H[DMXKit.DipSwitchAssembly0x7fd72990d0e0400]gt,     ltNSLayoutConstraint0x7fd72856e9c0 V[DMXKit.DipSwitchAssembly0x7fd72990d0e0133]gt   Will attempt to recover by breaking constraint  ltNSLayoutConstraint0x7ffb19798000 DMXKit.DipSwitchAssembly0x7ffb1979a000.width  3DMXKit.DipSwitchAssembly0x7ffb1979a000.heightgt codepre  pThis is repeated a couple of times, with the exact same i.e. same pointer constraints.

This is because Table1.date only records the date, and puts in all zeroes for the time i.e. YYYYMMDD 000000.000. My CTE gets the current datetime, and obviously that will have something other than zeroes in the time so I am using CONVERT to turn them both only into dates and ignore the times, as they are irrelevant.p  pNo matter what I seem to do Ive played around with different joins, and not using the CONVERTdate,, to no avail. The output seems to always be the same it only returns 5 records with values, when I need 2 more which should just read null0.p

An object could then be created byp  precodetemplate ltclass T, class Measurergt Object createlabelconst Tamp value, Measurer op      return Objectvalue, opvalue  codepre  pShould this method be somehow incorporated into the codeObjectcode class something like a policy I was thinking something similar to allocators in the STL. Is there a generic design pattern for this kind of problem and how would you write such a classp  pAlso, should the constructor codeObjectconst Tamp content, const Rectamp boundingboxcode be marked as codeprotectedcode, so that the user is pointed to the codecreatelabelcode methodp

In addition, codedb2connerrorcode and codedb2connerrormsgcode do not contain anything.  On the flip side, when I do provide a valid library list, my codeIFcode statements evaluate the same exact way, the only difference is an error isnt output to the screen by codeinisetdisplayerrors, 1codep  pI realized that instead of failing due to the invalid library list it instead is making a connection using the default library list for the DB username provided.  This can be scary for me because if for some reason my library list is invalid it will default to the wrong list main concern being a mixture of development and production environments.p  pCan anyone else reproduce this behavior  I dont know if this is just my system and I need a PTF, or if this is typical.
