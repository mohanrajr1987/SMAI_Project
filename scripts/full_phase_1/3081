Positive 3081 pI am working on an assignment in Ruby.. I had to write RSPEC tests for a method that removes an entry from my addressbook app.. and also had to write a test and a method for importing 5 entries from a CSV. In my removeentry method when I run the Specs it says that I have an undefined method of delete. I have already asked a couple fellow ruby devs and they could not figure it out at first glance. The next error is that when I run the tests for my CSV imports.. The data is not being imported in the proper order.

Positive 3081 pWhen I am testing for a particular project I create a new instance of an ActiveRecord object usingp  precodeObjectType.newparameters codepre  pThis instantiation in RSpec 3.3 the latest version calls the aftersave callback within that model though. This behavior does not match what actually happens in the development environment and what I expect when that new instance in memory is created. Additionally if I do a binding.pry on the test that this is ran on I can examine the database and in fact there is a persisted object in the database that is created by RSpec instead of just using the in memory object.p  pWhy is this behavior occurring and how should I fix itp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pSo it appears that if you have a dependency object that relies on the in memory ActiveRecord object and then that object is saved to the database, the in memory object will also be saved.p  pFor example.p  precodeobj  ObjectType.newparameters DependencyObject.createrelieson obj codepre  pThe codeobjcode object will be persisted to the database first and then the DependencyObject will be saved.p
Positive 3081 pFrom time to time, I find myself spending quite a bit of time diagnosing and troubleshooting false positives that come from my automated tests.  Out of a few hundred tests driven in a browser, around 4 of them fail with seemingly no rhyme or reason, and they tend to be different each and every time.  For example, some simple shared steps may work in one example but then fail for no reason in another.p  pIve continued to spend time troubleshooting and improving these areas improving waiting on elements, improved preconditions, etc but it seems to only help marginally.  Anecdotally, this phenomenon seems to worsen when using IE11 vs Chrome.p  pIve come across a neat gem called coderspecretrycode which simply retries any failed tests as they come along.  Im wondering what the consensus is with this approach, as Im adamant of making sure that Im testing the right way.p

Ive written JavaOracle systems that can happily do thousands of insertsupdates in the same time in both cases running local databases MySQL 5 vs OracleXE.p  pNow in something like Java or .Net I could quite easily do one of the followingp  ol liWrite the data to an inmemory writebehind cache ie it would know how to persist to the database and could do so asynchronouslyli liWrite the data to an inmemory cache and use the PaaS Persistence as a Service model ie a listener to the cache would persist the fields orli liSimply start a background process that could persist the data.li ol  pThe minimal solution is to have a cache that I can simply update, which will separately go and upate the database in its own time ie itll return immediately after update the inmemory cache.  This can either be a global cache or a session cache although a global shared cache does appeal in other ways.p  pAny other solutions to this kind of problemp

Negative 3081 pIm trying to inject some CSS that accompanies some other HTML into a C managed WebBrowser control. I am trying to do this via the underlying MSHTML DomDocument property control, as this code is serving as a prototype of sorts for a full IE8 BHO.p  pThe problem is, while I can inject HTML via mydomdocument.body.insertAdjacentHTML and Javascript via mydomdocument.parentWindow.execScript, it is flatout rejecting my CSS code. p  pIf I compare the string containing the HTML I want to insert with the destination page source after injection, the MSHTMLs source will literally contain everything emexceptem for the codeltstylegtcode element and its underlying source.p  pThe CSS passes W3C validation for CSS 2.1. It doesnt do anything too tricky, with the exception that some backgroundimage properties have the image directly embedded into the CSS e.g. codebackgroundimage urldataimagepngbase64code ..., and commenting out those lines doesnt change the result.p  pMore strangely and I am not sure if this is relevant, was that I was having no problems with this last week. I came back to it this week and, after switching around some of the code that handles the tobeinjected HTML before actual injection, it no longer worked. Naturally I thought that one of my changes might somehow be the problem, but after commenting all that logic out and feeding it a straight string the HTML is still appearing unformatted.p  pAt the moment Im injecting into the codeltbodygtcode tag, though Ive attempted to inject into codeltheadgtcode and thats met with similar results.p  pThanks in advance for your helpp  ptomp

What happens is that the first menu item slides up and the newly clicked slides down, just like expected. But the arrow gif doesnt change back on the menu that slides up. This happens because its toggle function is still in the first state, and if I click on it again, thus removing the detailsPanelSelected class, all that happens is that the image changes back. Looking at the code, this is expected.p  pSo my question is, how do I make it so that a menu items detailsPanelSelected is removed when another menu header is clicked Can I somehow reset the pending toggle functionp

Negative 3081 pI am trying to setup a php page which uses cURL to hit a third party server to log them in. Right now my code does successfully log in to the third party server, but since cURL is not sending the SESSION cookies to the user, the user must login in themselvesp  pHow can I get cURL to forward cookies to the client. Thanksp
Negative 3081 pI want two special methodsp  ul lione that runs for all URLsli lione that runs only for a specific path emadminemli ul  pI thought the most general would be using codebegincode, and the method for emadminem would use codeautocode.

What is the correct solutionp  pstrongEDITstrong the problem is that codeAddminautocode is never called, not when I access emadminem or emadminemp  pAfter more tests, codeautocode is never called. Ive tried to put auto at different places, it is never called.p

Negative 3081 pI have a subclass of codeNSProxycode designed to forward messages to either an object instance or to Lua functions if they are defined for the selector. This works in most cases. codeUITableViewControllercode, however, is a different case altogether. When I set up my proxy object with an instance of codeUITableViewControllercode or a stub subclass it doesnt seem to ever receive any of the codeUITableViewDelegatecode or codeUITableViewDatasourcecode messages that I expect it to.p  pI have the necessary methods implemented up in Lua, and they respond correctly when called manually, but they never seem to be called when I add the proxy codeUIViewControllercode view to the hierarchy. What might I be missingp
Negative 3081 pWere looking to iron out issues in our different devtestprod environments.  p  pCurrently we have to remember to change the name of linked servers in stored procedures when we migrate from UAT into Production. For example, in Production, a sproc in SMOLDB calls across a linked server to LSAUTH.AuthenticationDB.dbo.SomeSproc because AuthenticationDB is on a different server.  But in Dev and UAT SMOLDB and Authentication are on the same server. p  pTo get around this risk, were thinking well set up consistent references to linked servers in all our environments.   So even in UAT wed create a LSAUTH linked server, and SMOLDB will still call LSAUTH.AuthenticationDB.dbo.SomeSproc p  pDo calls to linked servers go out onto the network before they are resolved  Not sure if we want to impact network traffic in those cases when the two databases are on the same server and dont need to go through a Linked Server.p  pThe idea of ServerVariables I guess is an option...p

Negative 3081 pI have a Moose class with an attribute that is an ArrayRef readonly and is manipulated internally by the object. But when someone calls the accessor method I want it to return an Array or list not a reference.

Negative 3081 pim quickly finding im quite the beginner to php, so please bare with mep  pI have a quick problem, I have a remove button for a shopping cart and the code works for it everytime except for the last product thats in the cart. If a person pushes the addtoCart button the URL is reloaded with buyproductproductNumber and when the remove button is pushed the product is removed. Right so everything is good, but when you try to remove the last item, it keeps reading the product thats in the URL. so the quantity remains 1 for the current productNumber.p  pive tried adding the action in the form method tag so that the page reloads without the buyproductproductNumber, which does work however there are page numbers and sections that were also in the URL and these get reset also.p  pi know the remove is working because once the buyproductproductNumber is gone from the URL which can happen for example if they go to another section in the catalog then the cart can be completely emptied. p  pThank you so much ahead of time for any1s help, Ive used this site before and you guys are geniussp

Negative 3081 pIm parsing text documents and inserting them into PostgreSQL DB. My code is written in Java and I use JDBC for DB connectivity.

Ive simplified my code to isolate the error  simplified version doesnt parse any text but I simulate it with generated words. strongSource files are includedstrong java and sql at the end of my question.p  pIn simplified example of my problem I have onethreaded code, one JDBC Connection, 3 tables and few SQL statements involved full Java sources are less than 90 lines.p  pMain loop works for documents  20 words with subsequent docid integer.p  ol liBuffer table codespbword4objcode is cleared for docid to be just inserted.li liWords are inserted into buffer table codespbword4objcode,li liThen unique new words are inserted into table codespbwordcode li liAnd finally  documents words are inserted into codespbobjwordcode  with word bodies replaced by wordids from codespbwordcode references.li ol  pWhile iterating this loop for some time e.g. 2,000 or 15,000 iterations  it is unpredictable it fails with SQL error  cannot insert null wordid into codespbwordcode. It gets more strange as repeating this very last iteration by hand gives no error. It seems like PostgreSQL have some issue with record insertion and statement execution speed  it loses some data or makes it is visible for subsequent statement after small delay.p  pSequence of generated words is repeatable  every time code is run it generates the same sequence of words, but iteration number when code fails is different every time.p  pHere is my sql code to create tablesp  precodecreate sequence spbwordseq  create table spbword    id bigint not null primary key default nextvalspbwordseq,   word varchar410 not null unique   create sequence spbobjwordseq  create table spbobjword    id int not null primary key default nextvalspbobjwordseq,   docid int not null,   idx int not null,   wordid bigint not null references spbword id,   constraint spbakobjword unique docid, wordid, idx   create sequence spbword4objseq  create table spbword4obj    id int not null primary key default nextvalspbword4objseq,   docid int not null,   idx int not null,   word varchar410 not null,   wordid bigint null references spbword id,   constraint spbakword4obj unique docid, wordid, idx,   constraint spbakword4obj2 unique docid, word, idx  codepre  pAnd here goes Java code  it may just be executed it has static codemaincode method.p  precodepackage WildWezyrIsAstonished  import java.sql.Connection import java.sql.DriverManager import java.sql.Statement  public class StrangePostgresBehavior       private static final String letters  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz     private static final int llen  letters.length     private Connection conn     private Statement st     private int wordNum  0      public void runMe throws Exception          Class.forNameorg.postgresql.Driver          conn  DriverManager.getConnectionjdbcpostgresqllocalhost5433spb,                 wwspb,          conn.setAutoCommittrue         st  conn.createStatement          st.executeUpdatetruncate table spbword4obj, spbword, spbobjword          for int j  0 j lt 50000 j               try                  if j  100  0                      System.out.printlnj    j                                   StringBuilder sb  new StringBuilder                  for int i  0 i lt 20 i                      sb.appendinsert into spbword4obj word, idx, docid values                               getWord  ,  i  ,  j  n                                  st.executeUpdatedelete from spbword4obj where docid    j                  st.executeUpdatesb.toString                  st.executeUpdateupdate spbword4obj set wordid  w.id                           from spbword w                           where w.word  spbword4obj.word and docid    j                  st.executeUpdateinsert into spbword word                           select distinct word from spbword4obj                           where wordid is null and docid    j                  st.executeUpdateupdate spbword4obj set wordid  w.id                           from spbword w                           where w.word  spbword4obj.word and                           wordid is null and docid    j                  st.executeUpdateinsert into spbobjword wordid, idx, docid                           select wordid, idx, docid from spbword4obj                           where docid    j              catch Exception ex                  System.out.printlnerror for j    j                 throw ex                                 private String getWord          int rn  3  wordNum  llen  llen  llen         rn  rn  llen  rn  llen  1         rn  rn  rn  2  10          StringBuilder sb  new StringBuilder         while true              char c  letters.charAtrn  llen             sb.appendc             rn  llen             if rn  0                  break                                return sb.toString           public static void mainString[] args throws Exception          new StrangePostgresBehavior.runMe       codepre  pstrongSo again is it me doing something wrong what exactly or is it serious flaw in PosgreSQL SQL Engine than  is there a way for workaroundstrongp  pIve tested above on Windows Vista box with Java 1.6  PostgreSQL 8.3.3 and 8.4.2  JDBC PostgreSQL drivers postgresql8.2505.jdbc3 and postgresql8.4701.jdbc4.

Counting files in the project directory I find that an unlogged version produces 1373 whereas a logged version produces 1294.

Negative 3081 pIm using the standard autocomplete plugin a hrefhttpdocs.jquery.comPluginsAutocomplete relnofollowherea.p  pI have two text boxes on my form, item name and item id. The idea is that I want the user to search for the item by name, but on form submit I actually need the item id.p  pI am returning json from an ASP.NET MVC action which is used in the autocomplete.p  pThe user starts typing an item name, the autocomplete list appears and is formatted to show the item name from the json object. The user can then click on a name from the list and the item id will be populated in the other textbox which will actually be a hidden field once everything is working. I can then check that there is a value in this second textbox before submitting the form.p  pIn the above scenario everything works great. But there are two huge bugs in what Ive got so farp  p1 The user has to actually click on the item in the list for the coderesultcode function to fire. So if there is an item strongapplesstrong, and the user simply types strongapplesstrong directly into the textbox, the item id doesnt get populated.p  p2 The user could select strongapplesstrong from the list, which populates the item id. The user then changes his mind and goes back to the text box and types strongorangesstrong. Again, if he doesnt actually click on the item in the list, the item id doesnt change and now when the form is submitted the wrong item id is submitted. Same thing if the user types something which isnt a valid selection, for example he changes the textbox to strongapplesblahblahblahstrong, the item id of strongapplesstrong is still going to be submitted even though a valid item choice wasnt made.p  pIve seen examples which suggest this can be solved by firing the codesearchcode event, but Ive tried that and it doesnt really seem to do much.p  pDoes anyone know how to solve this problemp  pMy code so far is below, its all pretty standard at the moment...p  precodeItemSearch.autocompleteMyActionFindItems,      dataType json,     parse functiondata          var parsed  []         for var i  0 i lt data.length i              parsed[parsed.length]                   data data[i],                 value data[i].Value,                 result data[i].Key                               return parsed     ,     formatItem functionrow          return row.Value      .resultfunctionevent, data, formatted      this.valdata.Value     ItemId.valdata.Key .blurfunction       this is where I was trying to force an update of the item id textbox,       but it doesnt work.     this.search  codepre  pId be greatful for any pointers.

Negative 3081 pI posted this question originally in the MigLayout forum since it is to some extend specific for that specific of Layout Manager, Id say. Unfortunately its a week old now without any comments at all, thus Id like to repost the question here, in hope its not considered Xposting.p  pWell, I have the following problem In general Id like to grey out some content the content of a JPanel more precisely. I nearly managed to achieve the desired effect via placing another JPanel flowing over the desired area with a transparent colour. Theres one major problem left though Once I set the overlay panel visible, the components below will not immediately paint correct. Instead they will initially paint with some white colour, until for example I minimize and remaximize the frame which would cause the transparent effect to be drawn correct.p  pAs example I attached a screenshot of the buggy appearance. Mind the radio buttons and check boxes with their white appearance. Additionally I attached code to reproduce the effect. Currently Im working on Windows 7, 32bit with Java 1.5. Java 1.6 didnt make any difference.p  pI played around quite a lot with the various paintrepaintinrevalidateetc. methods. Nothing worked to paint the overlay panel correct right after setting it visible.p  pAny ideasp  pBR, Chrisp  pEDIT1 Regarding the code sample  if you run it you have to click the check button to trigger the overlay panel.  Another thing which I noticed is that the appearance problems differ based on the UI LampF used. In my case I used once Windows and once the native Java UI is it called metal and they showed different results, even though none of them worked properly Pp  pLink for a screenshot of the bug a hrefhttpsdocs.google.comleafid0B2V067ThMVaZYTQ0ODdiYTktMjBmMC00ZmY3LWE4YzAtZjhlNGYzMzE2MmVjamphlen relnofollowScreenshotap  precodeimport java.awt. import java.awt.event. import javax.swing. import net.miginfocom.swing.MigLayout  public class MigTest    public static void mainString[] args      JFrame f  new JFrame     f.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE     f.addnew TestLayeredPane     f.pack     f.setVisibletrue      public static class TestLayeredPane extends JPanel      private JPanel pnloverlay  public TestLayeredPane    super   this.setLayoutnew MigLayoutfill, wrap 2, ,     initLayout  private void initLayout    JPanel pnldirection  new JPanelnew MigLayoutwrap 3, ,    JPanel pnlsettings  new JPanelnew MigLayoutwrap 1, ,    JPanel pnlinput  new JPanelnew MigLayoutwrap 3, ,     JLabel lblaskfor  new JLabel   JLabel lbltranslation  new JLabel    ButtonGroup btngroup  new ButtonGroup   JRadioButton radiobtnasklang1  new JRadioButton   JRadioButton radiobtnasklang2  new JRadioButton   JRadioButton radiobtnaskrandom  new JRadioButton    JCheckBox chkboxloop  new JCheckBox   JCheckBox chkboxrepeatfalse  new JCheckBox   JCheckBox chkboxlettercount  new JCheckBox   JCheckBox chkboxaskall  new JCheckBox    JLabel lblprogress  new JLabel   JLabel lblquestion  new JLabel    JButton btncheck  new JButton   JButton btnpushback  new JButton    JTextField tfieldanswer  new JTextField     Customize all elements of our layout    lblaskfor.setTextAsk for    lbltranslation.setTexttranslation    radiobtnasklang1.setText1st language   radiobtnasklang2.setText2nd language   radiobtnaskrandom.setTextRandom language    btngroup.addradiobtnasklang1   btngroup.addradiobtnasklang2   btngroup.addradiobtnaskrandom    chkboxloop.setTextLoop   chkboxrepeatfalse.setTextRepeat false answers   chkboxlettercount.setTextShow letter count   chkboxaskall.setTextAsk for 1st and 2nd language    btncheck.setTextCheck   btncheck.addActionListenernew ActionListener       public void actionPerformedActionEvent e        finishTraining            btnpushback.setText Push back     Add all elements to this panel    pnldirection.addlblaskfor, span 1 3   pnldirection.addradiobtnasklang1   pnldirection.addlbltranslation, span 1 3   pnldirection.addradiobtnasklang2   pnldirection.addradiobtnaskrandom    pnlsettings.addchkboxloop   pnlsettings.addchkboxrepeatfalse   pnlsettings.addchkboxlettercount   pnlsettings.addchkboxaskall    pnlinput.addlblquestion, align center   pnlinput.addlblprogress, span 2, align center   pnlinput.addtfieldanswer, span 1 2, align center, w 200   pnlinput.addbtncheck, growy   pnlinput.addbtnpushback    pnloverlay  new JPanelnew MigLayoutfill, ,    pnloverlay.setBackgroundnew Color127, 127, 127, 100   this.addpnloverlay, pos 02px 02px 1002px 1002px    pnloverlay.setVisiblefalse    this.addpnldirection, gapbefore push   this.addpnlsettings, gapafter push   this.addpnlinput, span 2, gapbefore push, gapafter push   private void finishTraining    disable all visible items in the content area   for Component comp  this.getComponents       if comp instanceof JPanel        for Component comp2  JPanel comp.getComponents          comp2.setEnabledfalse                 else        comp.setEnabledfalse           pnloverlay.setVisibletrue      codepre

Negative 3081 pSo I havent been coding in C for quite a while now, but Im pretty sure this issue is related to SOCI and not some general knowledge of memory usage in C.

Here is the code  p  precodestring enginegetReviewint revid       try          session sql         string post          sql.openmysql, dbrankingdev user password         sql ltlt SELECT post FROM reviews WHERE id  3, intopost Faulty line          return post          catch exception const ampe          cerr ltlt Error  ltlt e.what ltlt n         return        codepre  pIm positive that this line is the root of the error. I tried to initialize the post variable, but to no avails. Also, if I retrieve an integer value from the table and thus store the data in an integer, theres no SEG FAULT. And so I guess the issue is related to the way Im using this string, but I can see anything overly wrong in my function. Any ideas on thisp

Negative 3081 pIm currently trying to create a procedural planet generating tool.

That is, the view that woud be receiving these inputs if the current topmost view had userinteractionenabled set to no.p  pSetting userinteractionenabled works but i feel like its a dirty hack. The gist is this topmot view is mostly transparent and i want the events when touched in the specified region to end up on the other stack.p  phere is a picture to help visually explain, and keep in mind both blue views are 100 of parent.p  pa hrefhttpc.crap.ps35a5 relnofollowhttpc.crap.ps35a5ap

Negative 3081 pI have a Java web application that uses JNDI to determine its home directory where various configuration files and logging takes place.  During a Maven build, we set the home directory location in a property that is located in settings.xml.  This property in turn gets put into the JettyTomcat JNDI file during the build by Maven resource filtering.  Everything works great.p  pHowever, this set up requires that only one Maven build can happen on a machine at a time, which will be a problem soon for our Hudson CI server.  It also requires that users create this directory ahead of a build, which helps to break build portability.  Ideally I could use the target directory of the parent POM project as the home directory by defining a variable in the parent POMp  pcodeltwebapphomegtproject.basedirtargetltwebapphomegtcodep  pBut this doesnt work because each Maven module redefines codewebapphomecode to be something different.  I have no idea why.  If I could solve THAT problem, Id be all set.p  pOtherwise, what can I use as a good temporary home or working directory, that is unique to a build and is constant across all Maven modules in the build  And the bonus question is  Can I have Maven create the directory for me if it doesnt existp

Im having some trouble understanding the working directory concept in git vs. SVN.  p  pWhat I didp  ol liI created a local repo and pointed it to the folder where my project files are.li liAdded and committed all the files in the folder.li liEdited a file. Showed up as modified. li liAdded and committed the file.li ol  pThese steps worked. p  pSo far I have not been asked for the location of the working directory and I cannot checkout the master HEAD the option is disabled. My question is Is my original folder acting as the checkout working directory When does the checkout command work Does it only come to play when I have multiple branches  p  pHope someone can clarify this before I go any further.p

I am compiling a shared library that includes a templated class codeDerivedltTgtcode, whose base is codeBasecode and some explicit instantiations of this class.

The problem arises when I try to codedynamiccastcode the users instance from codeBasecode to codeDerivedltTgtcode.p  pI have narrowed down the problem to this MWEp  pThe shared library contains the following filesp  pemBase.hemp  precodeifndef BASEH define BASEH  class Base  public     Base     virtual Base   endif  BASEH  codepre  pemDerived.hemp  precodeifndef DERIVEDH define DERIVEDH     include ltBase.hgt  template lttypename Tgt class Derived  public Base  public       Derived     virtual Derived   endif  DERIVEDH  codepre  pemDerived.cppemp  precodeinclude ltDerived.hgt  template lttypename Tgt DerivedltTgtDerived      Base    template lttypename Tgt DerivedltTgtDerived     explicit instantiations template class Derivedltfloatgt template class Derivedltdoublegt template class Derivedltlong doublegt codepre  pemHelper.hemp  precodeifndef HELPERH define HELPERH  include ltBase.hgt  class Helper  public     HelperBase m     virtual Helper    endif  HELPERH  codepre  pemHelper.cppemp  precodeinclude ltHelper.hgt include ltBase.hgt include ltDerived.hgt  include ltiostreamgt  using namespace std  HelperHelperBase m       cout ltlt after received  ltlt m ltlt endl     cout ltlt after fom  ltlt  dynamiccastlt Derivedltfloatgt gtm ltlt endl     cout ltlt after dom  ltlt  dynamiccastlt Derivedltdoublegt gtm ltlt endl     cout ltlt after ldom  ltlt  dynamiccastlt Derivedltlong doublegt gtm ltlt endl     cout ltlt  ltlt endl   HelperHelper   codepre  pAnd a simple code that uses the library could bep  pemtest.cppemp  precodeinclude ltDerived.hgt include ltHelper.hgt  include ltiostreamgt  using namespace std  class MyModel  public Derivedltdoublegt  public     MyModel  Derivedltdoublegt            virtual MyModel                  int mainint argc, char argv[]       MyModel om1     cout ltlt created mymodel  ltlt ampom1 ltlt endl     cout ltlt before fom  ltlt  dynamiccastlt Derivedltfloatgt gtampom1 ltlt endl     cout ltlt before dom  ltlt  dynamiccastlt Derivedltdoublegt gtampom1 ltlt endl     cout ltlt before ldom  ltlt  dynamiccastlt Derivedltlong doublegt gtampom1 ltlt endl     cout ltlt  ltlt endl     Helper rootampom1      return 0  codepre  pThe problem is that when I create a shared library and link codetest.cppcode against it, the codedynamiccastcode fails.

Negative 3081 pI wrote some code to tackle a workrelated problem. The idea is that the program is in an infinite loop and every 10 minutes it checks a certain folder for new files and if there are any, it copies them to another folder. My code reads all the files in the folder and drops the list into a txt file. After 10 minutes it checks the folder again and compares the old list with a new list. If they are identical, it doesnt do anything.  This is where I stopped, because my idea is iffy and stupid and started to think of better ways.

Negative 3081 pIm updating an application to be 64bitcompatible, but Im having a little difficulty with our movie recording code.  We have a FireWire camera that feeds YUV frames into our application, which we process and encode out to disk within an MPEG4 movie.  Currently, we are using the Cbased QuickTime API to do this using Image Compression Manager, etc., but the old QuickTime API does not have support for 64 bit.p  pMy first attempt was to use QTKits QTMovie and encode individual frames using codeaddImageforDurationwithAttributescode, but that requires the creation of an NSImage for each frame which is computationally expensive and it a hrefhttpwww.mailinglistarchive.comquicktimeapilists.apple.commsg00370.htmldoes not do temporal compressiona, so it doesnt generate the most compact files.p  pId like to use something like QTKit Captures QTCaptureMovieFileOutput, but I cant figure out how to feed raw frames into that which arent associated with a QTCaptureInput.  We cant use our camera directly with QTKit Capture because of our need to manually control the gain, exposure, etc. for it.p  pOn Lion, we now have the AVAssetWriter class in AVFoundation which lets you do this, but I still have to target Snow Leopard for the time being, so Im trying to find a solution that works there as well.p  pTherefore, is there a way to do nonQuickTime framebyframe recording of video that is more efficient than QTMovies codeaddImageforDurationwithAttributescode and produces file sizes comparable to what the older QuickTime API canp

RECT rect HDC hdc  GetDChwnd GetClipBoxhdc, amprect  D2D1SIZEU size  D2D1SizeU     rect.right  rect.left,     rect.bottom  rect.top    Now create the render target ID2D1HwndRenderTarget hwndRT  NULL  hr  mpD2DFactorygtCreateHwndRenderTarget     D2D1RenderTargetProperties,     D2D1HwndRenderTargetPropertieshwnd, size,     amphwndRT        And then the bitmap render target ID2D1BitmapRenderTarget bmpRT  NULL  We want it 3x as wide amp 3x as high as the window D2D1SIZEF size  D2D1SizeF     rect.right  rect.left  3,      rect.bottom  rect.top  3  hr  originalTargetgtCreateCompatibleRenderTarget         size,         ampbmpRT            Now I draw the geometry to my bitmap Render target...   Then get the bitmap ID2D1Bitmap bmp  NULL bmpRTgtGetBitmapampbmp   From here I want to draw that bitmap on my hwndRenderTarget.  Based on where my mouse was when I started panning, and where it is  now, I can create a destination rectangle. Its the size of my  drawing window D2D1RECTU dest  D2D1RectUx1, y1, x1size.width, y1size.height hwndRTgtDrawBitmap     bmp,     NULL,     1.0,     D2D1BITMAPINTERPOLATIONMODELINEAR,     dest      codepre  pSo when I check the size of my bitmap, it checks out OK  its the size of my bitmap render target, not my hwnd render target. But if I set x1 amp y1 to 0, it should draw the top lefthand corner of the bitmap which is some geometry off the screen. But it just draws the top leftcorner of what strongisstrong on the screen.p  pDoes anyone have any experience with this How can I create a fairly large bitmap, and then render a portion of it on a smallersized render target Since Im panning, the render will take place on every mousemove, so it has to be reasonably performant.p

Or   if one method returned an object and the other returned an integer, for example. If the inconsistency between two methods is just a different type of object for example, the Fractions add method takes a Fraction object as its argument and returns one, and the Complexs add method takes and returns a Complex object, the compiler will still generate the correct code because memory addresses that is, pointers are passed as references to objects anyway.p blockquote  pI dont quite get it that the first part of the paragraph says that the compiler strongmightstrong generate incorrect code if I declare 2 methods in different classes with the same name and different type of arguments. while the last part of the paragraph says that it is fine to have 2 methods with the same name and different arguments and return types...oh no...p  pI have the following code and they compile and run finep  precodeimplementation A  int addinta      return 1  a  end implementation B  int add B b      return 100  end id a  [[A alloc] init] id b  [[B alloc] init] NSLogA i, B i, [a add100], [b addb] codepre  pEdit As the text I cited, the code above is supposed to cause errors, but it only produces some warning messages, strongMultiple methods named add foundstrong, strongIncompatible pointer to integer conversion sending id to parameter of type intstrongp  pI have Java and C background, I know polymorphism in ObjectiveC is slightly different from that of those languages but I am still confused about the uncertaintytext in bold.p  pI think I must have misunderstood something, would you please explain in more detail about dynamic binding in ObjectiveC for me and those who need itp  pThanks youp

Length is set in characters         global post         text  postgtpostexcerpt         if    text               text  getthecontent             text  applyfiltersthecontent, text             text  strreplace]]gt, ]]gt, text                  text  stripshortcodestext  optional, recommended         text  striptagstext  use  text  striptagstext,ltpgtltagt  if you want to keep some tags          text  substrtext,0,length         excerpt  reversestrrchrtext, ., 1         if excerpt               echo applyfilterstheexcerpt,excerpt          else              echo applyfilterstheexcerpt,text                     Returns the portion of haystack which goes until the last occurrence of needle     function reversestrrchrhaystack, needle, trail          return strrposhaystack, needle  substrhaystack, 0, strrposhaystack, needle  trail  false      codepre  pThis can then simply be used e.g. codeltphp printexcerpt50 gtcode. The code below changes the excerpt length based on the title length. How would I go about combining these two pieces of codep  precode        ltphp          Dynamically resize excerpt according to title length         remlen   clear variable         titlelen  strlenpostgtposttitle get length of title         iftitlelen lt 35             remlen188 calc space remaining for excerpt         elseiftitlelen lt 70             remlen146         elseiftitlelen lt 105             remlen104         elseiftitlelen lt 140             remlen62                  truncex  substrpostgtpostexcerpt, 0, remlen truncate excerpt to fit remaining space         ifstrlentruncex lt strlenpostgtpostexcerpt truncex  truncex .

Negative 3081 pSince recently NetBeans started coming up with Upload Files on Save failed mistakes over and over again. And I cant do antything about it. I tried using passive mode and downgrading JDK back to 6th version. But it just wont work properly. Sometimes I randomly approve pop up windows and it would turn FTPSFTP support off alltogether until I restart the IDE... A few times I had issues with case sensitivity and someFolder would end up being somefolder on remote nix server, while still showing as someFolder on my Windows machine. Well, it also completely blocks itself during FTP download process.  Before that I used to work with Remote File System plugin and it was ok, but I cant get it to work with the 7 version.

Negative 3081 pI intend to build a delegated login system for an existing app. Ill be implementing both the OAuth client in a web application and the OAuth server a simple authorization and resource server, that really only has a user resource for now.p  pWith that in mind, I came across the following section in the current a hrefhttpstools.ietf.orghtmldraftietfoauthv2 relnofollowOAuth 2 drafta version 22p  precode3.1.2.1.  Endpoint Request Confidentiality     If a redirection request will result in the transmission of an    authorization code or access token over an open network between the    resource owners useragent and the client, the client SHOULD    require the use of a transportlayer security mechanism.     Lack of transportlayer security can have a severe impact on the    security of the client and the protected resources it is authorized    to access.  The use of transportlayer security is particularly    critical when the authorization process is used as a form of    delegated enduser authentication by the client e.g. thirdparty    signin service. codepre  pThis specifically warns me that I should be using TLS on the client. We emwillem be using HTTPS on the server, of course, but enabling HTTPS on all clients will be difficult if not impossible.p  pFrom my limited understanding of security, I imagine someone could steal the authorization grant. This brings me to my questionp  pstrongWont client authenticationstrong using the client secret strongprevent an eavesdropper from using the authorization grantstrong Because the malicious party wont know the client secret, hopefully.p  pIf it doesnt, or if theres another attack vector here Im not seeing, is there anything I can do to make this work securely without HTTPS on the clients Would, for example, OAuth 1 help Perhaps because it has the additional request token step.p  pP.S. I was planning on doing client authentication using TLS client certificates, rather than secrets, if that makes the situation any better.p

Negative 3081 pI have a custom android view that extends Button and acts as a multilevel spinner  when it is pressed it displays a series of spinnerlike dialogs that allow a user to refine their selection. In this case, it allows the user to select the day, then hour, then minute in 5 min intervals that they want a pickup to occur. When the dialog is not active, a text description of the current selection is shown on the button.p  pI want to visually indicate that the user can change the selection by pressing the button, and think that the look of a spinner is exactly what I need for it. I want the look to be the same as other spinners on the device, and be able to easily change the text on the button, but Im not sure how to achieve that without it being kludgy. How should I go about displaying a button as a spinnerlike icon that is consistent with other spinners on the devicep

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasureltpgt                          lth3gtSection 1.10.33 of de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum, written by Cicero in 45 BClth3gt                          ltpgtAt vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga.

Rackhamlth3gt                          ltpgtOn the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.ltpgt                     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt                 ltdiv idfootergt                     Footer                 ltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 3081 pIm trying to get a div to wrap around a dynamic number of child elements and Id like to do this without setting a value for the width of the parent.p  pIve got the content wrapping by floating both the child and parent elements, my problem is when the child elements wrap onto the next line theres free space left over on the right side and Id like the parent to wrap tightly.p  pIve set up a demo here a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netUMgct4 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netUMgct4ap  pparent shows the current behaviour, Id like it to behave like parent2 and parent3, but without explicitly setting the width.

Negative 3081 pOther questions dealing with use of matchparent pre 2.2 have answers stating one should use fillparent for safe backwards compatibility.p  pWhat Ive noticed is when your targetsdk is set to 8 or greater and a minsdk is set to 7 or lower, use of matchparent or fillparent is irrelevant. Im guessing this is bc the xml gets compiled down to a binary blob so the use of either one is irrelevant once the app is packaged into an apk.p  pWhat I find curious is why theres no runtime error for use of codeLayoutParams.MATCHPARENTcode on 2.1 devices in java code. Id expect to see some kind of RuntimeException for NoSuchClassMember when trying to access LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT in code.p  pIm guessing that maybe this deals with how how a class file gets compiled in java.

Negative 3081 pI dont use tables a lot, but when I do get some tabular data it goes in a table. But I was wondering if there was a better, or proper, way of aligning cells other than using empty cells.p  pFor example, Im working with a checkout table that lists each product, price, etc in a row adding as many rows as needed. At the end, theres the standard sub, shipping, total fields.p  pNow they want the last section all on the right and this is a pretty standard setup that Ive come across. Not everyone has it that way but enough that Ive seen it. So Im not against it, but the only way I can see to do it is to add a lot of empty cells to get the aligning correct.p  precodelttrgt     lttdgtltThis cell should be emptygtlttdgt     lttdgtltThis cell should be emptygtlttdgt     lttdgtltThis cell should be emptygtlttdgt     lttdgtltThis cell should be emptygtlttdgt     lttdgtltThis cell should be emptygtlttdgt     lttdgtSubTotallttdgt lttrgt lttrgt     lttdgtltThis cell should be emptygtlttdgt     lttdgtltThis cell should be emptygtlttdgt     lttdgtltThis cell should be emptygtlttdgt     lttdgtltThis cell should be emptygtlttdgt     lttdgtltThis cell should be emptygtlttdgt     lttdgtTotallttdgt lttrgt codepre  pSince I normally try to follow semantics pretty closely, this doesnt feel right. Like Im missing something. But in other areas, some cells just arent filled becuase there is no particular data to put there, i.e. if one product has an option but the other products dont. So it cant be wrong since those fields MUST be empty. So Im caught and dont really know if this is right, wrong, opinion, or what.p

Negative 3081 pIm trying to create a test app in which the user can pause an animation by clicking in the SceneView.

Negative 3081 pHere is what I dop  pI have bitmaps which I draw into another bitmap.p  pThe coordinates are from the center of the bitmap, thus on a 256 by 256 bitmap, an object at 0.0,0.0 would be drawn at 128,128 on the bitmap.p  pI also found the furthest extent and made the bitmap size 2 times the extent.p  pSo if the furthest extent is 200,200 pixels, then the bitmaps size is 400,400.p  pUnfortunately this is a bit inefficient.p  pIf a bitmap needs to be drawn at 500,500 and the other one at 300,300, then the target bitmap only needs to be 200,200 in size.p  pI cannot seem to find a correct way to draw in the components correctly with a reduced size.p  pI figure out the target bitmap size like thisp  precodefloat AvatarCompositegetFloatWidthfloatamp remainder const      float widest  0.0f     float widestNeg  0.0f     forsizet i  0 i lt mcomponents.size i              ifmcomponents[i].getSprite  NULL                      continue                   float w  mcomponents[i].getX                mcomponents[i].getSpritegtgetWidth  2.0f               mcomponents[i].getScale  getWidthToFloat         float wn  mcomponents[i].getX                mcomponents[i].getSpritegtgetWidth  2.0f               mcomponents[i].getScale  getWidthToFloat          ifw gt widest                      widest  w                  ifwn gt widest                      widest  wn                   ifw lt widestNeg                      widestNeg  w                  ifwn lt widestNeg                      widestNeg  wn                   remainder  2  widest  widest  widestNeg     return widest  widestNeg  codepre  pAnd here is how I position and draw the bitmapsp  precodeint dw  mcomponents[i].getSpritegtgetWidth  mcomponents[i].getScale         int dh  mcomponents[i].getSpritegtgetHeight  mcomponents[i].getScale         int cx  getWidth  mremainderX  getWidthToFloat  2         int cy  getHeight  mremainderY  getHeightToFloat  2         cx  mremainderX  getWidthToFloat         cy  mremainderY  getHeightToFloat         int dx   cx  mcomponents[i].getX  getWidthToFloat  dw  2         int dy   cy  mcomponents[i].getY  getHeightToFloat  dh  2         ggtdrawScaledSpritemcomponents[i].getSprite,0.0f,0.0f,             mcomponents[i].getSpritegtgetWidth,mcomponents[i].getSpritegtgetHeight,dx,dy,             dw,dh,0 codepre  pI basically store the difference between the original 2  longest extent bitmap and the new optimized one, then I translate by that much which I would think would cause me to draw correctly but then some of the components look cut off.p  pAny insight would help.p  pThanksp  pEssentially,  imagine you have a plane. That plane starts at 0,0 which will be the center of the target bitmap. By target bitmap I mean render target  framebuffer object. Im drawing avatar components into a bitmap, then I render that bitmap to the screen.p  pThe way it currently works is by finding the furthest the plane will extend. So the longest extent might be at 600,700 on the plane. In order for an object at 0,0 to land at the center of this bitmap while still being able to see everything, the dimensions must be longest extent  2, so the bitmap that everything is drawn into is 1200,1400. The longest extent may also be on the other side of the plane. If the longest extent on the left was 800,800, then the target bitmap should actually be 1600,1600 in size.p  pThe problem is this, that tends to waste a lot of video memory. You might have a character whose  a lot on 1 side of the plane but barely on the other. Thus, if you have an object at 100,100 and an object at 200,200, then the effective space you need is roughly 300,300 to display this and not 400,400 which the current method does. To correctly display this, I need to change the size of the target bitmap, offset the position of the components in the bitmap, and offset where the final result is drawn on screen so that it appears the object at 0,0 is at the center of the screen. p

Negative 3081 pIm writing a C NUnit test that makes 100 simultaneous TCP connections to a server. The purpose of the test is to stress the server.p  pTo do this, the test creates 100 new threads, loops over them and calls codethread.Startcode, then loops over them again and calls codethread.Joincode.p  pEach thread will execute a method that makes the TCP connection, requests some data, checks if the received data is not null, then prints how long it took to complete.p  pWhat Ive noticed is that with 100 connections, the time required for each thread to complete its task rises from 2 seconds to 50 seconds, for threads that write to the console later. However, when I introduce a 2 second delay between each call to codethread.Startcode, the time required is 2 seconds for every single thread.p  pW.r.t. the nodelay scenario, Im wondering if the increase in time required could be due to issues on the machine running the unit test i.e. my dev box.

Negative 3081 pI am working on a large web site, and were moving a lot of functionality to the client side Require.js, Backbone and Handlebars stack. There are even discussions about possibly moving all rendering to the client side. p  pBut reading some articles, especially ones about Twitter moving away from client side rendering, which mention that server side is faster  more reliable, I begin to have questions. I dont understand how rendering fairly simple HTML widgets in JS from JSON and templates is a contemporary browser on a dual core CPU with 48 GB RAM is any slower than making dozens of includes in your server side app. Are there any actual real life benchmarking figures regarding thisp  pAlso, it seems like parsing HTML templates by server side templating engines cant be any faster than rendering same HTML code from a Handlebars template, especially if this is a precomp JS functionp

This codeSessionFactorycode only exposes an codeopenSessioncode and codecloseSessioncode.

I introduced codehibernate.connection.releasemodeafterstatementcode to my codeltbean idsessionFactory classorg.springframework.orm.hibernate4.LocalSessionFactoryBeangtcode definition.p  pOnly afterstatement seems to work.  With this setting in place, the program executes wo issues for trivial and nontrivial runs.  Note that codehibernate.currentsessioncontextclassthreadcode does not seem to have any impact. Overall using releasemode feels very hacky.  The need to aggressively release connections after each statement must have unwanted consequences for an app under load.  p  pSo  what is happening Why doesnt codegetCurrentSessioncode return a session without an active Transaction bound to the Thread  Is the codeTransactionalcode annotation the only way codehibernate4.LocalSessionFactoryBeancode can work out when to kick in a transaction  Spring Docs seems to be very sparse on topic.p  pFurther, switching down to codehibernate3.LocalSessionFactoryBeancode and switching other configs referencing hibernate4 back to hibernate3 yields the nasty codejava.lang.NoClassDefFoundErrorcode codeorghibernatecacheCacheProvidercode, which is covered by other threads on stackoverflow.p  pAny ideas Really appreciate some input.

Negative 3081 pIm busy working on a project involving knearest neighbour regression. I have mixed numerical and categorical fields. The categorical values are ordinal e.g. bank name, account type. Numerical types are, for e.g. salary and age. There are also some binary types e.g., male, female.p  pHow do I go about incorporating categorical values into the KNN analysisp  pAs far as Im aware, one cannot simply map each categorical field to number keys e.g. bank 1  1 bank 2  2, etc., so I need a better approach for using the categorical fields. I have heard that one can use binary numbers  is this a feasible method  Advice would be much appreciated.p

Negative 3081 pI have an account key that I check when processing items. This key prevents me from spending time working on items that are no longer valid.

It has not been modified in weeks or months depending on the key.p  pThis query periodically fails to retrieve a result. Roughly 1 in 10,000 times. Errors appear to be distributed among the keys i.e. the problem is not with just one record.p  pAny suggestions on how to get rid of these errors I need the information that is stored inside AuthorizedKey in order to accurately process the requests. If data is coming in that does not have a key, I want to stop processing it as quickly as possible.p  pUpdate  The record that matches the query is typically created a few days before it is ever used. These records have been in place on average for months. They have worked millions of times, existed before, and continue to exist. Sometimes, the response to the get call is None.p  pWhile multiple records have exhibited this problem, one particular record has been consistently accessed since about 2 days after its creation. I just added monitoring code on the inner loop a few days ago. There is no error message returned. p  precodeif not authorizedkey  codepre  pright after the code above returns False roughly once out of every 10,000 times. Accessing before and after works. An entity with a secretkey that matches my argument has existed for just shy of 8 months and has been successfully accessed millions of times. This is the reason for my question, to ask for help. I quietly fail in this case and automatically retry later. The retry works fine. Exactly the same data.p  pAside from the odd nature of the issue, the main reasons that I worry about this are  Reliability of the core system  Other areas of the system may not be degrading as gracefully as this one.p  pThank You,p  pJacobp

Negative 3081 pIs there any simple way to move picture parts any stuff created with codeDrawImagecode or codeDrawStringcodep  pMy smart idea Override codeDrawImageDrawStringcode method adding ability to store width, height, left, top, of drawn image and may be boolean variable sizable if I use codeDrawImagecode method to a list of objects. Attach function WhatToMove to PictureBoxs codeMouseMovecode event, which walks through a list of stored rectangle objects, detects what rectangle cursor is over, in case of resizeable rectangle detect if cursor is over any of rectangles borders and pass this stuff as parameters to the codeMouseDowncode function, when I click. Then codeMouseDowncode function will attach new function MoverResizer to codeMouseMovecode event, which redraws picture box with moved or resized parts of image, updates proper rectangle object in list, and also detachs WhatToMove from codeMouseMovecode. On codeMouseUpcode and Leave events of PictureBox detach MoverResizer and attach WhatToMove.p  pIf you think this idea can live you will really help me if tell me how to override DrawImage.p  pMy dumb ideap  pCreate Labels without text and with borders and locate them over PictureBox right over proper image parts. Then make them draggable and sizeable with their own events. Then translate positions of labels to positions of parts of picture and redraw picturebox. This is simply but I think not so perfect as method above.p

Negative 3081 pI want to use a video player using html 5 and flash. Now the video player will be displayed on  online exams and teachers will simply upload video files. I have basic extension validation where the teacher has to choose either code.mp4, .ogg, .wav or .flv.code. p  pNow I want the video player to work on all major browsers and I do not want users to mess about converting formats. I want a video player which works for the above formats stright away on all browsers without any problems or conversions needed.p  pCould somebody recommend a video player which can do this I tried to use jwplayer but realised after uploading an .mp4 file that it would not display the video until I convert the video. I dont want teachers or students who have no knowledge or no access rights to be able to do this so that is why I want a different video player which just works straight away with ease.p

Negative 3081 pI am trying to do addapt the contenteditable directive I foud on angularjs website a hrefhttpdocs.angularjs.orgguideconceptsdirectives relnofollowhttpdocs.angularjs.orgguideconceptsdirectivesa.p  pMy problem is that if I change the value inside the contenteditable div inside my controller, the scope value is updated but the value in the div isnt. I would like to be able to do something like this in my main controller  p  precodescope.content  scope.content.concatadded text codepre  pThis updated the scope.content but it does not update the contenteditable div. And so, if I click in the div to edit it, my modification is gone.p  pIn order to make it work, I would have to call ctrl.render from my controller but I cant find any documentation on what is this 4th parameter of the link function.p  pDoes anyone have an idea what this ctrl parameter represents and if by change some know how to solve my problem p

Negative 3081 pim developing a theme and for some reason i need to move the default position for breadcrubms also for many other things over woocommerce themes. Then i realised to do something like this on my functions.phpp  precodefunction woocommerceremovebreadcrumb     removeaction woocommercebeforemaincontent, woocommercebreadcrumb, 20  addactionwoocommercebeforemaincontent, woocommerceremovebreadcrumb  function woocommercecustombreadcrumb     woocommercebreadcrumb      addaction woocustombreadcrumb, woocommercecustombreadcrumb  codepre  pAnd then on any template file, output the breadcrumb just withp  precodelt doactionwoocustombreadcrumb gt codepre  pAnd works. My question is more than that. Is this the correct approach for something like this I mean for anything over woocommerce, not just breadcrumb, for any pice, ratings, titles, buttons, sidebar, and so on. What im thinking on is why woocommerce templates dont come with more deep code. I mean, why theres no such a singlecontentloop.php template where you can just change the order of things, title, category, content, images, etc. in an easy way rather that hooking into functionsp
Negative 3081 pI have an existing database with a table structure like thisp  precodeTABLE [Parent]   [ParentID] UNIQUEIDENTIFIER   TABLE [ChildA]   [ChildAID] INT   [ParentID] UNIQUEIDENTIFIER FK gt [Parent].[ParentID]  TABLE [ChildB]   [ChildBID] INT   [ParentID] UNIQUEIDENTIFIER FK gt [Parent].[ParentID] codepre  pTo support future functionality, I need link rows of codeChildAcode and codeChildBcode so that there is exactly one codeChildBcode for each codeChildAcode. The new structure should bep  precodeTABLE [ChildA]   [ChildAID] INT   [ParentID] UNIQUEIDENTIFIER FK gt [Parent].[ParentID]  TABLE [ChildB]   [ChildBID] INT   [ChildAID] INT FK gt [ChildA].[ChildAID]   [ParentID] UNIQUEIDENTIFIER FK gt [Parent].[ParentID] codepre  pNow, both tables contain several rows in both the codeChildAcode and codeChildBcode tables that are nearly duplicates. For the sake of this question lets assume that the number of rows in each table is the same for any given codeParentIdcode. I need to pick a unique codeChildAcode for each codeChildBcode, even if I have to pick them at random.p  pThis works for cases where there is exactly one row in each tablep  precodeUPDATE b SET    [ChildAID]  a.[ChildAID] FROM   [ChildB] b        INNER JOIN [ChildA] a ON a.[ParentID]  b.[ParentID] codepre  pI dont have any other criteria to add to the codeJOINcode. I think codeROWNUMBERcode would work, but this database is running on SQL Server 2000. How would I go about assigning a codeChildAIDcode to each codeChildBIDcode when there are multiple records p
Negative 3081 pI can find lots of information on how Long Polling works For example, this, and this, but no simple examples of how to implement this in code.p  pBasically, how would I use Apache Tomcat to serve the requests, and how would I write a simple app  spring  which would longpoll the server for new messagesp  pThe example doesnt have to be scaleable, secure or complete, it just needs to work I would appreciate it if anyone could give me such a tutorial or refer any other.p

Negative 3081 pI am using visual studio 2010 on windows server 2010 with Sharepoint 2010 server. I am deploying webparts to a Sharepoint instance running on the same server. p  pMy new webpart makes use of a custom library, codeAE.Net.Mailcode. When I deploy this webpart, I get the codeCould not load file or assembly...code error for codeAE.Net.Mailcode. I have run codegacutilcode but I do not see the assembly in codeCWindowsassemblycode. I do see it in a subdirectory of codeCWindowsMicrosoft.NETassemblycode. p  pNow I am not sure about this but I think when my Sharepoint instance runs, it only looks at codeCWindowsassemblycode. And that is why it is not able to find the library. The reason I believe this is that the name of my webpart is present in codeCWindowsassemblycode. Its being cached there and not in a subdirectory of codeCWindowsMicrosoft.NETassemblycode.p  pI am using version codeAE.Net.Mail Version 1.6.0.0code which is compatible with code.NET 3.5code. I think my Sharepoint server is using 3.5 although 4.0 is present on the machine. I think so because when I tried to install the the library using nuget, I couldnt install the latest version that requires .NET 4.0. The error said that my project is using 3.5. Version 1.6.0.0 is compatible with 3.5p  pSo, what do you guys think is going on and how do you think I can get codeAE.Net.Mailcode into codeCWindowsassemblycode Been at this for hours now and I cant figure it out Dragging and dropping doesnt workp  pThanks guys. p

Negative 3081 pId like to embed some of my code on GitHub into my blog.

Its not clear to me how authentication could work in this case  since any auth token I might use will need to be part of the JavaScript on my blog, so it will basically be public... p  pAnd also, even if I could somehow authenticate this usage by perhaps connecting my codeOrigincode domain with my GitHub user account, wont that mean that all readers of my blog will count against this shared rate limit, vs. the unauthenticated case where every reader is counted against his own 60hour limitp

Negative 3081 pI am learning HTML 5 and CSS3 and am having trouble with my tabbed navigation bar.  I thought the liactive css stlye would achieve my goal but that only is upon click and doesnt stay that way.  I have looked at many tutorials across the web and cannot find out how to do this with just CSS and HTML. I would like to avoid using javascript or php if possible.  I have found information in a few places on child elements and using the zindex properties, and think this may be a possible solution, but do not understand how to implement them.  They look how I want on hover, but I want them to stay that style when I click them to give the effect of an active tab.

Negative 3081 pIs there a quick way to clear the menu bar i.e. Remove all menus in PyQt.p  pThe reason I ask is that I am developing a modular application. Each module provides its own menus and gives a weighting to where that menu should appear. Each module can also add a menuAction to another modules menu, however when that happens it changes the order of the menus. What i want to do is when the menus have finished being created is to remove them all and then re add them.p  pI know this will work because I can re add them now and they appear in the correct order but all the previous menus are still there.p

Negative 3081 pIm trying to solve the exercice 5.10 of the book Foundations of Multithreaded, Parallel, and Distributed Programming.p  pThe exercice is p  pAssume one producer process and N consumer processes share a bounded buffer having B slots. The producer deposits messages in the buffer consumers fetch them. Every message deposited by the producer is to be received by all N consumers. Futthermore, each consumer is to receive the messages in the order theu were deposited. However, consumers can receive messages at different times. For example, one consumer could receive up to B more messages than another if the second consumer is slow. Develop a monitor that implements this kind of communication. Use Signal and Continue discipline.p  pCan someone help me, pleasep  pThank you very muchp  p EDITp  pIm commenting now what I already made cause I thought that the question was very big if I wrote everything that.p  precode creating a buffer of B positions.  global buffer[B]   Monitor   cond okwrite cond okread int stampbuffer[B]  [0, 0, .., 0]  requestwrite int pos     if stampbuffer[pos] gt 0         waitokwrite     writemessage buufer[pos]     stampbuffer[pos]  N     signalAll okread   requestread int pos     if stampbuffer[pos]  0         wait okread     stampbuffer[pos]    releaseread int pos     if stampbuffer[pos]0         signalokwrite    codepre  hr  pSo, I think that I still have that problem A reader can read the same message two times.p  pThe basic idea of my algorithm is The writer write in a position pos and set the value of stamp[pos] to N. Then, when each reader read the position pos, it do stamp[pos]  1. So, if stamp[pos] is zero, the message buffer[pos] was already readed N times and the writer can write in this position again.p  pBut, if some reader read a message two times or more, the writer can wirte a new message in the position pos and some reader will not read the old message.p

Doing this synchronously, as I have it now, makes everything outside of this function work the way it should, but none of my ajax calls are successful and this.url is undefined.  p  pI am using the jquery node module to do this btw.p  pThis is the error that gets logged in the console  [TypeError Cannot read property headers of undefined]p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  precodefunction myFunction catname, myurl   var htmlresult    .ajax     type GET,     url  httpmyurl,     dataType html,     context this,     async false,     cache false,     error functionxhr, status, ethrown       console.logTHERE WAS AN ERROR       console.logthis.url       console.logcatname       console.logstatus       console.logethrown        htmlresult  myurl     ,     success  functionresult       console.logthis.url       console.logSUCCESS       console.logcatname       console.logresult        htmlresult  result        return htmlresult  codepre  pThank you for taking the time to read this.p
Negative 3081 pI have an application that uses several different forms to perform various actions. Some of the forms access data from submissions in other forms. p  pFor example a user places a new order on one form and adds a new item in another, the items can be added to orders.p  pSo this leads to the possibility that a user may be adding an order and realize that an item must be added first. So naturally a new tab will be opened to do so instead of losing the information added to the order.p  pCurrently I have a codeSESSION[form]code variable to let the form handling script know which function to use after form submission. The problem is that with multiple tabs open, this value will get overwritten by the last opened tab. I have had a couple ideas on how to handle this but so far nothing ideal.p  pstrongIdea onestrong use a hash value to identify different page loads and send the hash as a hidden fieldp  precodehash  POST[hash] form  SESSION[hash][form] codepre  pIssue session overloading. This method will make a new session value each time a form is loaded to uniquely identify the form submission. I could unset the value upon submission, but what if a form page is loaded and never submit, or if the page is refreshed. I would prefer to keep the session as light weight as possible.p  pstrongIdea twostrong use AJAX to set the codeSESSION[form]code value upon clicking submitp  pIssue users that do not use JS. I would like to be able to continue providing support to users that prefer to disable JS if possible, although this method seems like it could be a bit better. However, I am unsure whether there could be browser compatibility issues here.p  pstrongIdea threestrong create a hash id for each windowp  pIssue PHP cant distinguish between browser tabs. This would be the most ideal by far.p  pstrongIdea fourstrong split the form handling script into multiple files, thus removing the need for a value to select which function to use.p  pIssue inconvenient, but I am open to this idea if it proves to be the only real method to handle this issue. It would require a fair bit of restructuring though.p  pAny ideas on how to securely manage different tabs and session information in PHPp

From the main threads point of view, it uses the Cond to signal the rendering thread to perform an action and can also wait on the COnd for the rendering thread to complete that action. The rendering thread waits on the Cond for the main thread to send rendering requests, and uses the same Cond to tell the main thread its completed an action if necessary. The error Im getting occurs when the rendering thread tries to lock the Cond to checkwait for render requests, at which point it shouldnt  be locked at all because the main thread is waiting on it, let alone by the same thread.

Negative 3081 pOn our site we load stylesheets dynamically based on whether the display is retina or not. Right now, we are using codedocument.writecode for each codeltlink hrefstylesheet.cssgtcode we insert in the page, with different css files if the display is retina. p  pHowever, this hurts performance because it causes the css files to load synchronously, as the browser has no way of parsing the javascript to load the next file before the previous one is finished. I believe we can reduce page load time if we take advantage of modern browsers capability to look ahead and fetch resources asynchronously  in another words, if we load the CSS files in parallel instead.p  pMy current solution is to create a codeltlink idlinktagid hrefgtcode tag for every stylesheet to be loaded, immediately followed by a script which determines the retina status, then fills in the quotations with the appropriate file, along the lines ofp  pcodedocument.getElementByIdlinktagid.setAttributehref, retinastylesheet.csscodep  pThis seems to work fine, and when I examine the network waterfalls in Chrome developer tools, as well as on WebPageTest.org  running Chrome, Firefox, and IE, the stylesheets indeed load in parallel. However, it seems a little hacky. I was wondering if there are any dangers to creating a codeltlinkgtcode tag with an empty codehrefcode attribute, and if so, what are theyp  pOn a broader note, are there any other recommendations on how to load CSS dynamically and asynchronouslyp  pThanks for your helpp  pEDIT I just discovered this works toop  pcodedocument.getElementByIdlinktagid.href  retinastylesheet.csscodep
Negative 3081 pIm working within Facebook with the Koala gem and finally have to deal with a user having changed their password.

HOWEVER, the page delivered in response to the FB redirect is returned with XFrameOptions set to DENY with the result that the user never sees the reauthentication results.p  pIm lost as to why the XFrameOptions are set to DENY.p  pI have tried setting the XFrameOptions to SAMEORIGIN from within the Rails 3.2.6 application by adding the following line to the actionp  precoderesponse.headers[XFrameOptions]  SAMEORIGIN codepre  pNo luck.p  pI have also tried adjusting the response headers via Apache.

Negative 3081 pI am new to jQuery Mobile, and I am trying to replicate a native iOS app.p  pThe problem I am facing is the that I cannot find a way to smoothly swipe between pages which is common on iOS. In jQuery Mobile, it seems to register a swipe occurred and then swipes the page for you, but I like the feel of having the page follow your swipe. p  pIn iOS, you could use a UIScrollView with page control, but it was also really easy to do yourself by listening to touch events in a UIView. p  pAre there any librariespackages that will help me create smooth swiping transitions If not, are there jQuery bindings to track where the finger is on screen as it moves, so I can move the page and create such a transition myselfp  pThanksp

Every time I call execute on a new instance of worker after button is pressed, a new thread in SwingWorker thread pool is created up to 10 threads total created. After exceeding this limit, threads are reused as I expect. Because new workers are created sequentially after the previous one is finished, I dont understand, why the first thread is not reused immeadiately, because the previous worker already done its work. Say there can be only one single thread, which does some work at the time. I would expect thread pool to create only one thread, which is enought to serve all tasks. Is this usual behaviour Or there may be something wrong what denies reusability of the first thread and forces thread pool to create another onep  pIf it is normal I think it is waste of time for creation unwanted thread and memory for keeping the threads ready. Can I avoid it somehow Can I force SwingWorker to have only one thread in his pool  I think no, because number of threads is constant and dependent on Java implementation as far as I know.p  pCan I make SwingWorker to finish the thread after task was completed calling this.cancel in done method did not workp  pHere is code of my real world worker, for case there is some dependency that may cause the problem.p  precodepublic class MapWorker extends SwingWorkerltLong, Objectgt      Override     protected Long doInBackground throws Exception         try                  long requestId  handleAction                 return requestId     catchException e         logger.error Exception when running map worker thread., e         SwingUtilities.invokeLaternew Runnable             Override             public void run                 requestFinished                               MapUtils.showFatalErrore           return 1l           Override     protected void done         try             requestId   get             logger.infoReturned from map request call, ID , Long.toStringrequestId         catchInterruptedException e             logger.error Done interrupted  wierd, e         catchExecutionException e             logger.error Exception in execution of worker thread., e               codepre  pIn method handleAction a new thread with some blocking call is created and thread id is returned, which should not be anything weird.

Negative 3081 pI have read and read about this and I am still confused. We need to port a VB.NET library to something that will run on Android. We are trying to avoid switching to C because all our apps that rely on the library are in VB.NET. p  pI was investigating options and I came across MonoDevelop or it seems to be called Xamarin Studio now, and Xamarin.Android. It appears that with Xamarin Studio has support for VB.NET, but with Xamarin.Android installed only the C project types seem to include Android projects.p  pI understood that VB.NET and C compile to ostensibly the same intermediate code, so is it foolish to assume that there should also be options for VB.NET projects to work with Android projects The development environment already supports VB.NET and C compilation for other project types.p  pThanks for any comments.p

Negative 3081 pI need to write to recursive functions, where in the first one, I need to sum two integers digit by digit. I have written some code, but it gives me the final result multiplied by 10.

It seems like, for whatever reason, when I get to the line that creates the data reader, code execution simply leaves the library and returns to the winforms app.p  pWhen code execution appears to have returned to the UI, if I return to visual studio it appears that code execution is continuing, at least I can not click continue play.  The code execution is not paused.p  pWhat is also strange is that if I close the form dialog, it breaks back into the debugger on the line from the main form on the linep  precodefrmImportTextDelimited.ShowDialog codepre  pas though I were still debugging.p  pHopefully this makes sense  I cant figure out why, when debugging, I cant step past the line where I create the data reader, and why code execution goes back to the UI, but returns to the debugger with the dialog is closed.  No error is ever thrown.p  pThanks for any advicep

Negative 3081 pin the program for BLE112 I measure RSSI and then turn ON the LEDs. I have written a program for this purposes. I get RSSI and if the value is more then 70 dBm I turn on the LEDs in P03 and P04, and if the value is less then 70 dBm the LEDs are OFF.  But there is a problem when I flash my module all is OK  the LEDs are OFF, but when I connect my phone with BLE112 the LEDs turn on and thats all They dont respond to the statements of RSSI.

Instead of using a user name password system he wants to have the server maintain a list of approved cellular numbers the employee numbers that is queried and compared on each visit to web pages by mobile devices.

Negative 3081 pI am working on an app using objective C and Xcode. p  pFor the moment I am using a table view and returning rows with cells containing an image thumb and title. My problem is that now i need to change the layout and for 4 of the cells I need to make them fall on the same row so each article of the 4 should be 50 width. So basically create 2 columns but only for 4 of the articles. The rest remain on 1 column full width.p  pI would add an image but I dont have enough rep points.p  pI know there is some thing like collection view...but I am not very familiar with that one and I was hoping maybe theres an easier way than redoing the viewcontroller and all the connections I already have created there.p  pSince I am already using tableview..whats the best way to change the layout to fit what I need now p
Negative 3081 pIm curious if this can be done... I have a grid that contains several rows.  For various design reasons, I would like to maintain the height of the rows as codeheightAutocode.  Listbox is spanning across three rows within the grid. Unless I set its height to something specific codeheight70code, while items are added or removed, itll adjust its height dynamically, while also adjusting rows heights, since theyre set to codeAutocode.  This is a normal behavior and everything is functioning as it should  Im just trying to get around that behavior.p  pIs there a way, at all, to have this ListBox stretch vertically within current height of the rows it occupies, while having no direct control over the rows heights  I understand that rows height property being set to codeAutocode causes it to expand and contract based on its contents, but Im wondering if I can prevent my ListBox from having that authority, while allowing other items to do their normal thing.p  pI can get a fairly precise static height on the ListBox to make the whole interface look good, but I was hoping to have it stretch and occupy the space of the designated row, while maintaing rows height as codeAutocode and effected by any other content strongexceptstrong that ListBox.p  pIf it cant be done, does anyone have a suggestion for what Im trying to accomplishp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pBased on Sheridans excellent answer, I was able to achieve the desired outcome.

Negative 3081 pThe a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docstechnotesguidessecurityjsseJSSERefGuide.html relnofollowSSLEngine documentationa gives indication on how to properly close an SSL connection. More specifically, it gives instructions on how to handle a severed connectionp  blockquote   pIn addition to orderly shutdowns, there can also be unorderly shutdowns in which the transport link is severed before close messages are exchanged. In the previous examples, the application might get 1 when trying to read or write to the nonblocking SocketChannel. When you get to the end of your input data, you should call engine.closeInbound, which will verify with the SSLEngine that the remote peer has closed cleanly from the SSLTLS perspective, and then the application should still try to shutdown cleanly by using the procedure above.p blockquote  pBasically, if the link is severed, codeengine.closeInboundcode should be called. However, the documentation of this a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavaxnetsslSSLEngine.htmlcloseInbound2829 relnofollowcloseInbounda method indicates that it will throw an exception if it is called before receiving the proper closing message from peer. It seems to me that if the connection is severed, this closenotify message will never be received, so this method will always throw that exception. p  pI made the test, made a simple shutdown procedure where is codesocketChannel.readcode returns 1, I call codeengine.closeInboundcode and I indeed get the following exceptionp  precodejavax.net.ssl.SSLException Inbound closed before receiving peers closenotify possible truncation attack codepre  pWhat am I missing Arent those 2 parts of the documentation in contradictionp

Negative 3081 pI have a static array of struct objectsp  precodetypedef struct     MyObj superobj    MyObj subobj1    MyObj subobj2    bool slotused  MyObj codepre  pThe array is statically defined in a C modulep  precodeMyObj objs[MAXOBJS] codepre  pI have a codenewobjcode function that returns a codeMyObjcode to a place in the array that had code.slotused  falsecode, it also runs an codeinitobjcode on that object.  Theres a complementary codedelobjMyObj objcode that sets the codeslotusedcode to false.p  pHowever, I would like each object, even after being deleted to stay alive for as long as possible.p  pIf the array fills up and all code.slotused  truecode then code0code is returned by codenewobjcode.  This is for an led light show library on embedded projects, so thats okay, theres only a limited number of active light shows at any given moment.p  pHowever, what other members of codeMyObjcode do I need such as coderebuildcode, and what algorithm should I use to choose one of the keptalive but deleted objects from the array, once codeMAXOBJScode have already been newd, and are still alive  And how do I indicate to codenewobjcode that an object is indeed still alive though deleted, and doesnt need reconstructing  Im thinking an codeunsigned short instanceidcode, that goes back to zero once it reaches max value.  p  pAlso note that in your answer you can make use of the fact that each object may have a mother super object look at the pointers in the struct definition, so you could possibly store a coderebuildcode flag for each subobject in the mother, assuming the mother stays alive.  In fact there is a grandgrandgrand..mother object for each of the light shows that isnt stored in the array so is indeed never deleted and always alive.  For instance codeLSvolstepcode is a codeLSLSScode light show sequence object aka. codeMyObjcode here that is statically declared, similarly theres codeLSvolmaxcode.  But subobjects of the latter two are allocated on the static array upon initialization of the latter two.  I think this is the proper way to do things, so that I can call codeLSseqactivateampLSvolstepcode upon press of the up or down buttons.  Any other way here also welcome.p  pWould appreciate any ideas on a solution. Thanks  p  pBy alive I mean that the object hasnt been written over by another object. See each object has many properties not listed above to set.  Which gives each light show object unique behavior.  For instance I have function pointers codefunc1, func2code that define light shows actually set values to led PWM registers.  So each object prefers to stay alive, so that the construction process doesnt need to be called upon emeveryem activate with codeLSseqactivatecode.  Wouldnt it be insane if I had to construct a light show sequence object for turning the volume up one step which in turn only changes the value of one led in the end  lt thats why I need this try to keep alive thing.p

Negative 3081 pCodekit only allows you to disable compilation of JS files on a perfile basis, but whats worse is it consistently reverts JS files Ive already marked as no compilationoutput. p  pIt happens when you open a JS file to edit it, or when you switch Git branches. You dont notice the change, Codekit does a background refresh, and automatically updates your config.codekit. Next thing you know, youre saving the file, and Codekit is compiling a JS file you dont want.p  pI can work around by reverting changes to config.codekit, but in a large JS app, this is at best a poor workaround, and sitewide disabling of JS compilation should be an option.p

Negative 3081 pI want to build a large application in Dart using material design. To accomplish this I included paperelements into my project.

Negative 3081 pSo I am working on my first multiple file, nontoy, c project. I have a class that represents a multispectral image and all the information that goes along with it. p  pMy problem is how to design the part of the program that loads and object of this class with a file from diskp  pI dont think I need a class for this. Would switching to a functional approach be better for the file loading. This way I can have just a source file .cpp that has functions I can call while passing in pointers to the relevant objects that will be updated by the file accessed by the function.p  pI dont think static functions are what I want to use As I understand it theystatic functions are for accessing static variables within a class, arent they p  pIf I go the functional route, from codemaincode, how do I access these functions I assume I would include the functions .cpp file at the beginning of the codemaincode containing file. From there how do I call the functions. Do i just use the function name or do I have to prepend something similar to what you have to prepend when including a class and then calling its methods.  p  pHere is some example code of what I have tried and the errors I get. p  pOpenMultiSpec.cppp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  void test     stdcout ltlt Test function accessed successfully ltlt stdendl  codepre  pmain.cppp  precodeint main      test      return 1  codepre  pThe error says  test was not declared in this scope p

Negative 3081 pIve searched around and havent found a solution that sounds reasonable to me or that seems relevant to my specific problem even here on Stack Overflow.p  pThe problem is simple I have most of the work needed to do custom checkboxes on any cell of a list view I just need to detect hover onhover off to draw the hot images. These images are set as the controls state image table, so I want to change the subitem state on hovers and clicks.p  pI tried using codeNMHOVERcode, but after doing all the work to get things working it didnt work. Upon further research, it seems this is only issued if codeLVSEXTRACKSELECTcode is on, which I dont want I just want to handle hovers, not select on hoverp  pI looked into using codeNMHOTTRACKcode and codeNMACTIVATEcode, but that would only give me half the answer I would not know when all items stop being hovered over to coldify the last hot item.p  pI found some CodeProject project that does wacky things with internal tooltips. I dont want to touch internal data structures at all.p  pMy List View is subclassed. I require Common Controls 6. I need to run on XP or newer though a Vistaspecific option is also acceptable for the future.p  pDo I have any options here Thanks.p

Negative 3081 pIm using the sqlalchemy modules orm features to store objects.  These objects are custom Task objects that perform arbitrary tasks.  When retrieving these objects for later execution, I use a base class to make the retrieval.  The other objects inherit from this class when theyre created and inserted into the database.  Each one overrides the part of the base class that does work.  Lets call this the work function.  Unfortunately, after retrieval, my objects execute the base class work function instead of the derived class.p  pIt looks like thisp  precode    class Parent       def workself         print I am a parent      class ChildParent       def workself         print I am a child codepre  pThe sql alchemy session generation is like sop  precode    from sqlalchemy import createengine     engine  createenginemysqlmysqldbrootlocalhost3306mercury, poolrecycle3600      from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker     session  sessionmaker     session.configurebindengine codepre  pCorrect so far, I think.

Negative 3081 pIm working with Unity and RPC calls. Very basic stuff as my ability would be low atm. At the moment I have a client and server. When the client connects to the server, the user on the server can hit a button what is 22 and the client gets the answer to it and sends it back. The client doesnt calculate it, it has the answer and sends it back over. I am going to attempt the working out part now. However later on I would like to be able to show that 2 pcs are greater than one. I would like to have  two calculations or something that would take one pc a long time to work out and then split those so that there is one calculation to one pc. p  pAm I thinking about this all wrong in that its not going to be a long sum or anything like that What kind of calculation should I be usingp  pThe purpose of this is for a project. I am looking at distributed processing hence the whole 2 calculations takes too long on one machine so send one to another to save time, when I get the basics down I will be moving on to applying this to a game.p

Negative 3081 pIm working on a JavaScript form its not actually a form  its a Knockout interface that makes a request to another JavaScript object, but thats not important and Im a bit worried about some behavior Im not sure I can rely upon.p  pLets say I have an input and Ive attached a change event, either natively through onChange or via jQuery change. That change event updates a model that Im going to validate and then send off to the server as part of my form submission.p  pI also have a button with a click event that performs the submission.p  pIf I click the button, as far as I can tell, the form element change event triggers first. But can I rely on this behaviour Is the fact the change event fires first part of a recognized specification, or just a browser implementation detailp  pI took a look at the events specification a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTR2014WDDOMLevel3Events20140925 relnofollowhttpwww.w3.orgTR2014WDDOMLevel3Events20140925a but couldnt find an answer to my specific question, just that click, blur and focus events are treated synchronously  that is, theyre added to a queue and executed in order. But I dont know if the order is consistent between user agents.p  pIs this behaviour guaranteed by any specificationp

Negative 3081 pI encountered a strange issuefeature when I try to rotate a codeQGraphicsSvgItemcode object and set a position. p  pCheck the following example I have one code.svgcode for the sake of simplicity that is a blue rectangle. I create two codeQGraphicsSvgItemcode using the file and I rotate on of them with 90 degree. I set both of them to the same position, however the rotated one positioned wronglymaybe that is the correct behaviour. It looks like that the x,y coordinatetopleft corner is now the topright corner, remains like that it is not rotated.

Negative 3081 pThe best way to sum up the issue would be with a screenshot, but unfortunately my screenshots autosave to downloads and so I cant upload them. Whats happening is that when I enter the file select dialog in trying to upload a file, its automatically in the drive folder and wont move to any other folder. Ive tried restarting and resetting my machine, tried the upload process on a bunch of different platforms, tried using the other user account on my machine, tried updating my software, but none of these have made any difference. I can get into my downloads folder and open files from it fine outside of this context, and I can workaround by using the draganddrop to upload on platforms which have this feature, but otherwise Im stuck.p  pIve googled extensively to see if anyone else is having this issue and have found this thread a hrefhttpsproductforums.google.comforumtopicchromebookcentrald7g9EEDsr8w relnofollowhttpsproductforums.google.comforumtopicchromebookcentrald7g9EEDsr8wa but theres no helpful solution there recommended a powerwash but the asker has already done this several times. Ive also tried to find a solution with the help of my programmer employer, but no luck so he recommended asking here. It seems like it wouldnt be a hardware issue when I can still access the folder outside of this specific function, but if it were a problem with the running system it seems it would be happening across the board and therefore show up more in a google If anyone has any suggestions Id be very grateful as its getting quite tiresome having to drag and drop things into Facebook messages to get them uploaded The machine is less than a year old so if I cant find any solution Ill see about getting it replaced under warranty.

Negative 3081 pI have a massive log file that includes an example of a device driver failing. The driver is supposed to provide data from a buffer, which the client application reads. The driver logs the amount of data in the buffer before and after the read, and transfers data to the client in 512 byte chunks. There is a lot of junk data randomly scattered across multiple lines in the log file. Below is a brief example or a normal working case.p  precodeBefore Transfer 1 Available 512 bytes ... junk data After Transfer 1 Available 0 bytes ... junk data Before Transfer 2 Available 512 bytes ... junk data After Transfer 2 Available 0 bytes codepre  pIn the error case, it looks like so the Transfer number is just from a specific example the issue doesnt always occur on transfer 35p  precodeBefore Transfer 34 Available 512 bytes ... junk data After Transfer 34 Available 0 bytes ... junk data Before Transfer 35 Available 512 bytes ... junk data After Transfer 35 Available 512 bytes codepre  pSo, Im trying to match a multiline query where a single transfer reports the same amount available in the Before and After logging statements.p  pIve tried this codesBefore Transfer. 512 bytes.After Transfer. 512 bytescode, and it helps find strongsomestrong of the issues, but the amount might be 1024, or 256, or some multiple of 256 bytes in the Before and After logging statements.p  pAdditionally, this query seems to highlight more than half of the file buffer in VIM. Im assuming this is because it finds matching queries within other queries ie nested results because I havent provided it with a way to only match with strongcorrespondingstrong BeforeAfter instance numbers in the log file.p  pI would like to set up a regex that goes through each strongmatchingstrong Before and After log line, and see if the data value number of bytes is the same both Before and After. If both of these criteria are met, it is a match as far as the regex search query is concern. The desired output, in the case of a file I moreorless manually parsed, was like sop  precodeBefore Transfer 35 Available 512 bytes After Transfer 35 Available 512 bytes Before Transfer 105 Available 256 bytes After Transfer 105 Available 256 bytes Before Transfer 220 Available 512 bytes After Transfer 220 Available 512 bytes Before Transfer 250 Available 2048 bytes After Transfer 250 Available 2048 bytes codepre  pHow do I go about creating such a queryp  pThank you.p

Negative 3081 pCouldnt find any useful tutorials online so I tried to freestyle an algorithm for this collision. p  pBasically, Ive modelled the strongPlayerstrong main character and strongPlatformstrong a tile that strongPlayerstrong can collide with as rectangles for the sake of collision detection. In my code, playerRect is the rectangle representing the player and getRect is the rectangle representing the Platform. p  pAs it stands my Player only moves from left to right, so he can only collide with 3 of the Platforms sides left, up and bottom.

So far so good Now Suppose emuser logs outem and somehow this time emlogs in with Twitterem. How should I connect the user table data since I have no idea its the same user already have registeredp  pI could use email, but some people have different email for Facebook and Twitter Account. In that case I will have duplicate profiles in user table. I know I can tell user to login and associate his social account with his twitter or create new profile. But am trying to check if there is anything I can do to associate user Twitter profile with same data in user table that user filled in when he used facebookp

Negative 3081 pI am trying to show three different vertical sections in my Android layout on one screen, each taking up one third of the screen, one on the top, one in the middle, and one on the bottom. Each section has a codeTextViewcode and a codeListViewcode, and the codeListViewscode can scroll so that you can see all items, but the overall page does not move. I have tried putting each codeTextViewcode and codeListViewcode in a codeLinearLayoutcode and setting the height of each codeLinearLayoutcode to one third the total height of the screen, but the first codeListViewcode just shows all the items in it, taking up most of the screen, and the other sections are pushed down. I also tried using layoutweights, but for some reason it did not work.

Negative 3081 pI have a web application where I want to handle the pinch zooming gesture in javascript rather than allowing the browser to scale all of the UI.

Ive wired up the pointerdown, pointerup, and pointermove events in javascript and Ive added my own calculations to determine the level of zoom to perform based on distance between two active pointers pinch gesture.p  pIn IE11 on the desktop, this works exactly as Id expect however, on the mobilemetro version of IE Ive been testing on surface pro, I can never seem to detect more than one pointer event at a given time. It simply fires a pointercancel on the first captured event and fails to fire the second pointerdown.

Since I know the type hierarchy, I know the lowest common ancestor of codeAcode and codeBcode, say codeCcode, and can just havep  precodepublic void fooCollectionlt super Cgt collection codepre  pI would rather not do this, though, since I very well might change the type hierarchy and would like codefoocode to be as generic as possible.p

Negative 3081 pI am building a web application which plays a single stream of audio when the user clicks a button. At least, thats the goal.  I am using audio.js. It works fine on desktop browsers, if I use a click event or if I use the touch event thats the code below when emulating an iPhone. However, as I saw with many other posts, I ran into problems when trying to actually run it on a mobile browser. Upon clicking the button in the mobile browser, its as if it is not detecting the ended event listener. The audio does not play and it gets stuck in the document.body.className  talking state see code in the function playAudio below. It never moves back into neutral state. Im rather new to this so I apologize if Ive missed something obvious but Ive tried many of the suggestions on other posts and I just cannot figure out what obvious thing it is that I am missing.p  precodelt Page LanguageC AutoEventWireuptrue CodeBehindquinn.aspx.cs InheritsQuinnSDS.quinn validateRequestfalse gt  ltDOCTYPE htmlgt  lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt lthead runatservergt     ltmeta nameapplemobilewebappcapable contentyesgt     ltmeta nameviewport contentwidth  devicewidthgt     lttitlegtlttitlegt     ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefcssrobotui.cssgt  ltheadgt ltbody class neutral gt     ltform idform1 runatservergt         ltdiv ideyesgtltdivgt         ltdiv idmouthgtltdivgt         ltbutton idtestButton classaction ontouchstartgtTestingltbuttongt         ltdiv idoverlaygtltdivgt       ltformgt      ltscript srcjsaudio.jsgtltscriptgt    ltscriptgt         document.addEventListenertouchend, function e              playAudio         , false         function playAudio             var music  new Audiofilestransformed.wav             music.addEventListenerended, function                  document.body.className  neutral                         document.body.className  talking            music.play              ltscriptgt ltbodygt   lthtmlgt codepre  pOnce I solve why its not playing on a button click, I ultimately need to somehow trigger the audio to download and play automatically on a timed event. On a normal browser, I simply had a timer which triggered a check to the server. If the check was true, the server would refresh the page and the audio would download and play on the page load. Given the limitations on iOS Im not sure how Im going do this on a mobile browser  I was thinking that perhaps I could use Websockets and have the server push the audio when its available. After the first user interaction, I believe you can then play audio whenhow you want If anyone has any suggestions on this particular problem as well, all advice is welcomep
Negative 3081 pI have a SAP Crystal Report in which maximum records I get from database will be 12. The number of records can vary from 0 to 12 depends on the conditions. Now I need to display fixed 12 rows in my Crystal Report regardless of the number of records retrieved from database.p

Negative 3081 pI am fairly new to iOS development, and have a project in mind that would benefit from a thirdparty calendar interface.  However, Im having trouble just getting started.

The first three are as followsp  ol liClone the Kal git repository codegit clone gitgithub.comklazukaKal.gitcode.

Drag Kal.xcodeproj and drop it onto the root of your Xcode projects Groups and Files sidebar. A dialog will appear  make sure Copy items is unchecked and Reference Type is Relative to Project before clicking Add.li liNow you need to link the Kal static library to your project. Select the Kal.xcodeproj file that you just added to the sidebar. Under the Details table, you will see libKal.a. Check the checkbox on the far right for this file. This will tell Xcode to link against Kal when building your app.li ol  pI have dragged the Kal.xcodeproj file  from Finder into the root of my project in the Project Navigator as seen in this image img srchttpi.imgur.comIEarwvt.png alt p  pIs this the correct place to drop the Kal.xcodeproj file  I was not presented with a dialog upon doing so.

Negative 3081 pI have a list of lets say size 10, I want to aggregate using max size 6. In this case it should work like this first six messages are aggregated into one message and then right away without any timeout the next 4 messages are aggregated into second message. How can I achieve this in spring integration I tried using releaseStrategy but I can only define in it the max size, and then the messages that are left 4 messages in my case are waiting in the aggregator for more messages so the max size condition is met. I dont want to wait for aggregator timeout cause I know that my lists size is 10, so there is nothing to wait for after the 4th message, it should create the second aggregated message right away.p

Negative 3081 pI am working on an access database that was built for me to use. I am familiar with writing VBA code to perform functions, however, I am not at all versed in debugging certain errors. p  pThere is a form in the database that allows me to clean up and manipulate data in files that I can select from my computer. It uses a folder as the main root to look into where I supply the form with the names of the files located in the folder. There is also a button that is connected to perform the data clean up and manipulations.p  pNow that the background is out of the way, there is an error that I cant seem to get passed. It also looks like if I solve the error, it snowballs into something else. Essentially the error is a Cannot find Project or Library. After going into my resources I noticed that there is a Microsoft Excel 15.0 Object Library that is missing.

Negative 3081 pI have a list of tasks in HTML..p  pWhen a task is done, jquery fadesOut the li, moves it to the bottom of the list, adds the checked class, and then fades in.. all good, except when it fades in, it not only removes the displaynone property it added with FadeOut but adds an inline style displaylistitem or any other display property the element had when it was hidingp  pI need the li to be exactly the same as it was before, so after the fadeIn, I dop  precode            li.fadeInfunction                 remove display property                 li.cssdisplay,               codepre  pIt is working fine, except when the user checks a task too quickly after one task has been checked, then this code does not run, and the element keeps the display property added by Jquery, which is breaking the list because of some other styles I have applied.p  pMy question is either why the fadeIn doesnt run when another fadeOutFadeIn starts too fast, or how could I stop the fadeIn from adding the attribute.p

Negative 3081 pId like to ask you a thing. I have one Rec actor and more Sen actors.

Is there a way to improve the Rec actor I dont like the whiletrue, but i cant extract the first number whenever i receive a message messages could stay in too long in the list. Should i use synchronizedwaitnotify or is there something better for Akka Thank you and sorry for my bad english.p
