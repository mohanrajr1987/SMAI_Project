Positive 1609 pI have deployed a JAXWS web service hosted in a JBoss 7.1.1. The webservice is acceded by a reverse proxy. To access the service from the public internet, it has to be done by the httpstrongsstrong protocol, but the communication between the reverse proxy and the JBoss is in http. So the host present in the wsdl file is http  codeltsoapaddress locationhttpexample.comWSgtcode and it has to be codeltsoapaddress locationhttpsexample.comWSgtcode.p  pThe JBoss configuration is as followsp  precodemodifywsdladdres  true   wsdlhost  jbossws.undefined.host codepre  pHere is the reference for the webservices configuration a hrefhttpsdocs.jboss.orgauthordisplayAS71Webservicesconfiguration relnofollowhttpsdocs.jboss.orgauthordisplayAS71Webservicesconfigurationap  pBut I can find where to force the protocol to be https in the soap addres.p
Positive 1609 pDescription of my situationp  pCurrently I am trying to generate a WSDL file.  This WSDL should be fully valid and represent the documentliteral wrapped style.  Moreover this WSDL should link to external xsd files which are contained in a specific FOLDER located in the same place as WSDL. As an additional info I can say that In this FOLDER have been located many subfolders and each of them contain 3 different XSDs.  I suspect, that in the Types section is only required to include the master file and the other two will be linked automatically.p  pProblemQuestionp  pAlways when I try to open file with i.e. XMLSPY I gain an error communicate which told me that the file have a problems with namespaces, with including of  the XSD files and also that elements that I put to the WSDLparts of the messages which should be a references to the mentioned earlier XSDs which  are not defined in the wsdl.p  pI am not proffesional in that area so  I would like to kindly ask you for help in the following areasp  p1.If I include every section needed to the WSDL file creation and its proper execution and validationp  p2.Is my file in the the documentliteral wrapped styleOr what sholud I changep  p3.How to include external xsd to the WSDL parts of communicate. I want to achieve a wsdl document which after import to i.e. xml spy would import my xsd from specific folder.p  p4.What are the role of namespaces and How to define it properlyp  pI enclose my WSDL file. p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8 standalonenogt ltwsdldefinitions xmlnstnsurnnoelhubemifwsdlmarketprocessesv1 xmlnswsdlhttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgwsdl xmlnssoaphttpschemas.xmlsoap.orgwsdlsoap

Positive 1609 pI found a question that asks the opposite of what Im trying to do here.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2142813addingmethodstothewebservicedooldclientsneedtoupdatewebreferencesAdding methods to the webservice do old clients need to update web referencesap  pBut, basically I have a web service that I inherited and there were originally grand plans but ultimately only a handful of methods were actually being called. Id like to remove to clean up the code some. p  pIt is used only internally and I can verify the only methods being used. The problem is that I cant update the client wsdl at the moment. So if I remove the calls from the web service but the clients wsdl isnt updated does that cause problems p  pKeep in mind I am completely positive these methods arent used as its all internal and we control the programs that use the web service. We can update the wsdl for the clients the next time these programs are updated but that will likely be next year.p

Positive 1609 pI ran into a nasty problem on Monday.  I have a java client application that integrates with a thirdparty SaaS provider.  The integration was done in 20122013, so the team wrote a WSDL document, implemented the serverside of the web service in JavaScript and the providers framework, and then used Apache CXF 2.5.10 to generate client stubs, and all was well.  Until our team discovered a security issue with the SaaS provider, and decided we needed to set a security setting to require authorization for requests to the WSDL document.  After my client bounced, the integration was broken, and every request to the web service gets a 401 error message Caused by javax.wsdl.WSDLException WSDLException faultCodePARSERERROR Problem parsing a hrefhttpscompany.saasprovider.comSaasProviderTicketManager.doWSDL relnofollowhttpscompany.saasprovider.comSaasProviderTicketManager.doWSDLa. java.io.IOException Server returned HTTP response code 401 for URL a hrefhttpscompany.saasprovider.comSaasProviderTicketManager.doWSDL relnofollowhttpscompany.saasprovider.comSaasProviderTicketManager.doWSDLap  pThe SaaS provider was very helpful, monitoring things on the wire and identifying the issue as the request for the WSDL was not coming with authorization headers that were being sent when making the actual SOAP request.p  pHow do I tell CXF to add the authorization headers on the request for the WSDLp

Positive 1609 pIm having a confusing problem. Im trying to make a Web cleint that uses codeWSDLcode. Im using C RAD Studio 10 Seattle, but the same problem occured in RAD Studio XE8older version.p  p1.I create a MultiDevice Application, add one Edit component and one Button. p  p2.I create a codeWSDLcode Importer by changing the location of the WSDL file to  a hrefhttpwww.w3schools.comwebservicestempconvert.asmxWSDL relnofollowhttpwww.w3schools.comwebservicestempconvert.asmxWSDLa and leave all other setting to default.p  p3.On ButtonClick event of the button I write two lines of code p  precode diTempConvertSoap Converter  GetTempConvertSoaptrue,      httpwww.w3schools.comwebservicestempconvert.asmxWSDL   Edit1gtText  ConvertergtCelsiusToFahrenheit32 codepre  pSo after these three steps I have one unit, which is the main Unit with the Form and with the button event. And one file emtempconvert.cppem that the WSDL Importer has generated. It quite actually just translates the WSDL code to a C one and defines the method to communicate with the server. In my case I have two methods  codeFahrenheitToCelsiuscode and codeCelsiusToFahrenheitcode, in the example I use codeCelsiusToFahrenheitcode.p  pI compile it to 32bit Windows platform, run it and when I click the button, the result 89.6 appears in the text of the Edit component. So this is working as expected.p  pBut when I change the target platform to Android and use my mobile phone Samsung GTI8262 with Android 4.1.2 and run the project, it just stops and exits.

Positive 1609 pI have a WCF service deployed in my development and test environment, same code and configuration. However, when I tried to use SOAP UI to test the service, in test environment I dont get parameters of a method, just an empty tag with an operation name. I used the Export Definition option in SOAP UI to compare what is downloaded from both environments. One wsdl file from dev points to 3 xsd files, but the same wsdl from test environment points to 3 another wsdl files, shows to be duplicates. There are no xsd files downloaded for test environment.p  pCan anyone explain what could be the cause of thisp

Positive 1609 pI have to use this exact XSD, so no changes are possible. I could narrow down my problem to the following codelocalisationNameTypecode.  When publishing the webservice without the codelocalisationNameTypecode all works fine and soapUI can generate a request. When adding the type it simply makes an empty project. Accessing by browser the wsdl can be opened. It is no proxyproblem because I ran it on the localhost.p  pI also tried with soap 1.2 and 1.1 so that cause can be excluded as well.

I found out about DTE.Debugger.Breakpoints.Add that able to add a breakpoint. However, I couldnt find any way for tracepoint. Or where is the breakpoint info for a project stored I couldnt find it in sln or vcproj. Or is there a way to convert breakpoint to tracepoint programatically I see that I can change it manually by changing the When Hit property dialog. p  pThanksp

Negative 1609 pDoes anyone have a valid alternative for using commented out code checked into the repository for findability reasons p  pThe reason I ask is because I had a discussion with a fellow developer recently on checking in code that is commented out. My stance is that commented out code should never be checked into our VCS since it is not technically part of the codebase, and thus annoying cruft which does not deserve the bytes it is taking up, so to speak.p  pHis counterpoint was that some of the commented out code he checked in still illustrated some work he would like to fix in the future in this particular point the commenting out occurred 2 years ago, but that is besides the point. He wanted to keep it in the codebase so he could easily find it, and even though it would not currently compile, it still showed in global lines the correct way to solve it.p  pIn the end he agreed, sort of, that commented out code does not belong. But when we were thinking of possible alternatives to his we came up pretty short. p  pThe only options I could think of werep  ul listrongWikistrong just paste it somewhere on a wiki. Drawback of this is that it will get mixed with other noncode related wiki content which may make it hard to search on it.li listrongIndex all VCS revisionsstrong This is largely theoretical for me, but are there systems which make a codebase and its entire history searchableli ul  pDoes anyone know ofuse any alternatives Both my options sound like more work than its actually worth, but that may be skewed by my reasoning that commented out code is worthless anyway. Id hate to have to go the Hey, if you dont have time to fix it now its not important enough to stay in the codebase anyway route but I will if there are no viable alternatives.p  pemSorry for the horrible title, I could not come up with a better oneemp

Negative 1609 pI am developing a C application used to simulate a real world scenario. Based on this simulation our team is going to develop, test and evaluate different algorithms working within such a real world scenrio.p  pWe need the possibility to define several scenarios they might differ in a few parameters, but a future scenario might also require creating objects of new classes and the possibility to maintain a set of algorithms which is, again, a set of parameters but also the definition which classes are to be created. Parameters are passed to the classes in the constructor.p  pI am wondering which is the best way to manage all the scenario and algorithm configurations. It should be easily possible to have one developer work on one scenario with his algorithm and another developer working on another scenario with his different algorithm. Still, the parameter sets might be huge and should be sharable if I defined a set of parameters for a certain algorithm in Scenario A, it should be possible to use the algorithm in Scenario B without copyamppaste.p  pIt seems like there are two main ways to accomplish my taskp  ul lipDefine a configuration file format that can handle my requirements. This format might be XML based or custom. As there is no Clike reflection in C, it seems like I have to update the configfile parser each time a new algorithm class is added  to project in order to convert a string like MyClass into a new instance of MyClass. I could create a name for every setup and pass this name as command line argument.p  ul liThe pros are no compilation required to change a parameter and rerun, I can easily store the whole config file with the simulation resultsli licontra seems like a lot of effort, especially hard because I am using a lot of template classes that have to be instantiated with given template arguments. No IDE support for writing the file at least without creating a whole XSD which I would have to update everytime a parameterclass is addedli ulli lipWire everything up in C code. I am not completely sure how I would do this to separate all the different creation logic but still be able to reuse parameters across scenarios. I think Id also try to give every setup a string name and use this name to select the setup via command line arg.p  ul lipro type safety, IDE support, no parser neededli licon how can I easily store the setup with the results maybe some serialization, needs compilation after every parameter changeli ulli ul  pNow here are my questions   What is your opinion Did I miss    important proscons    did I miss a third option   Is there a simple way to implement the config file approach that gives    me enough flexibility   How would you organize all the factory code in the seconde approach  Are there any good C examples for  something like this out therep  pThanks a lotp

Took me 5 minutes to throw together.p  p... but I simply dont trust that Ive got all the possible values, so I want to have a default to return something like Unexpected notification code 7410 if no matches are found.p  pUnfortunately, I cant think of anyway to return a valid pointer, without forcing the caller to delete the strings memory ... which is not only nasty, but also conflicts with the simplicity of the other return values.p  pSo I cant think of any way to do this without changing the return value to a parameter where the user passes in a buffer and a string length.  Which would make my function look like p  precodeBOOL GetDirectShowMessageDisplayText int messageNumber, TCHAR outBuffer, int bufferLength       ... etc ... codepre  pI really dont want to do that.

Negative 1609 pHmmmmm I worked on some PHP code that pulls stock levels from my supplier and inserts the stock level into the database based on the products SKU. Ive inserted it into the class.product.php file which contains all the code used for the individual product page.  The issue Im having is that when the product page loads, it doesnt show the updated inventory levels unless you hit refresh. Ive moved the code all over the place and cant get it to update the database and have the updated number loaded before the page is displayed. p  pEven when placed before all other code, I still have to refresh the page to see the update. I dont know what else to do about this. I feel like perhaps, I dont truly understand how PHP loads code. Ive been working on this every day for weeks. I tried running it as an include file, on a separate page, at the top, in the middle, all over the place.p  pIn the class file, it looks like I have the code before it calls the code to display the stock levels, thats why Im so confused as to why it wont load the updates.p  pAny thoughts on why Im unable to see the changes unless I refresh the pagep  pThanksp

This is jittery and slow.p  pSo I wanted to put some simple checks to limited it to only retrieving the contacts when 2 letters have been entered, and not retrieving anymore unless it goes below 2 letters then back to 2 again.p  pSo around my QueryContacts functions I addp  precodeifname.length lt 2                 mGotContacts  false             If the length is two letters long and we havent queried already, query for the name.             ifname.length  2 ampamp mGotContacts  false                Cursor code  Populate list with cursor data.  codepre  pProblem is now the autocompleteTextView no longer drops down, I have checked and the variable peopleLists which populated my SimpleAdapter is being correctly updated. p  pSo, am I doing this a daft way Should I just grab all of the data in one go and let the AutoCompleteTextView filter itp  pIs their a better way of doing this and why does it no longer work with those checks in my QueryContacts functionp

Thats all, now newViewController will get rotation events, etc.p  pBut UIView does not reference its controller, so how is this possible, how iOS know it should make newViewController an active one Does iOS do some magic, it internally references controller from view or whatp  pUPDATEp  pI think I was misunderstood I dont ask how to make some view controller an active one  I know that. Im just curious, how is it possible that I pass some view to UIWindow object [window addSubviewview] and it somehow finds view controller although view doesnt know its controller.p

Negative 1609 pIn my C application, I have a stored procedure which returns some kind of data from the database. The input parameters which I pass to the procedure are start date, end date and a such called number of lines parameter. Each line represents an entry in the database. Due to the database call restrictions I cant pass more than 5000 lines to the procedure per a call. Thats why I want to create a some kind of loop to send 5000 lines, get the corresponding data, then another 5000 lines, etc, until I get an output of lines less than 5000 which would mean that there are no more lines left.

Negative 1609 pIm trying to build some iOS apps while learning and am having some trouble understanding the proper way to do this.p  pWhat I have currently is a view that is a subclass of UIView. It is clear and I want to use it as a drawing surface. It will sit on top of something else, like tracing paper.p  pThe user should be able to click on one spot then another spot and a line should draw between the 2 points.

When everything loads up and drawRect is calle, it will draw a line just fine. But how do I make it draw new stuff or alter stuff that is already drawn based on what the user is doing. I know I need to call setNeedsDisplay, but not how to get the data to the view to draw stuff.p  pIve read a bunch of tutorialsexamples and they all stop at Override drawRect and draw some stuff... done. How do I pass data down in to the view to tell it hey, redraw this stuff and add this new line.p  pOr am I going about this all the wrong wayp  pstrongEDITstrong Ill try to explain better the setup I have.p  pI have a VC. Inside this VCs view I have a toolbar at the bottom. The rest of the area is taken up by 2 views. One is an image view that holds a reference image. One is the custom view that is clear tracing paper that sits at the top. They click a button on the toolbar which turns on a gesturerecognizer. They click on the screen, and I collect the tap data, turn off the gesturerecognizer and HOPEFULLY draw a line. Ive got it all working except the drawing part.p

Negative 1609 pMy app will let users cut out things from photos. Theyll be able to either select a photo already in their iPhones photo library, or take a new one with the camera. From what I understand, UIImagePicker is the simplest way to accomplish picking a photo from the library or taking a new one. However, I also understand that it only provides basic image editing zoom, crop. I want my image editing to allow for the creation of Bezier curves that, once all joined together, will cut out the enclosed area, saving it without the surrounding background.p  pThe official apple documentation on UIImagePicker suggested that the AV Framework is required for providing custom image editing as opposed to the basic zoom and crop. So my first questions arep  ol lipIs the AV Framework indeed what I want to usepli lipWill it get used in conjunction with UIImagePicker i.e., UIImagePicker is used to select the photo or take a new one, and then my AV Framework code takes over for the image editingpli lipCan anyone offer good resources on getting started on learning the code for this processpli ol  pMy final question is about the actual Bezier curve generationmanipulation. It appears that the Core Graphics Framework has support for this, but there is also the UIBezierPath object, which is apparently some kind of wrapper for the Core Graphics tools I would otherwise use.p  pSo my final question will I want to use the UIBezierPath object, or does what I previously described require more finegrained control that UIBezierPath cant provide, thereby forcing me to use the Core Graphics framework directlyp  pThanksp

Negative 1609 pI have been troubleshooting this for a while, and I am kind of new to programming.  Even when I find an error, its very difficult to figure out how to correct it.  Right now, I am trying to figure out how I have used xpath wrong because someone told me that I am using xpath wrong.  I hope someone can give me a jump start by telling me what I am doing wrong, specifically with iterating, if I am doing anything wrong.  This is my last night to work on this project, and I really want to finish it if I can.  So, I could really use help.

It doesnt work, so dont even go there.     currenttarget  currentsingletarget     countxmlgtxpathdoccurrenttarget      Puts the targets for keying into iterable arrays.  gt1 makes the array start from 1, so the ids will be right.    At this point, we have multiple elements that we want to key, each having a unique name.  Theres ltelementtype1agt and ltelementtype1bgt, etc.  We want each one to have its own id set.  So, we have to embed iteration within iteration.  foreachkeytarget This will ensure that every unique element that we want to key gets its key set.      id  currentkeytargetgt1 This allows us to reset the id to 1 gt1, each time the key algorithm starts for a new element.   foreachkeytarget as id I tried fori0, keytarget[i] igtkeytarget i, and it didnt work, so dont even go there.     addAttributeid, id      Adds an id attribute and a unique number to each target.  xmlgtasXMLnew.xml saves the output as a new xml document, new.xml codepre  pI also have a generic XML filep  precodeltdocgt     ltinfotype1gt         ltelementtype1agtnotuniquedataltelementtype1agt         ltelementtype1bgtuniquedataltelementtype1bgt         ltelementtype2agtnotuniquedataltelementtype2agt         ltelementtype2bgtnotuniquedataltelementtype2bgt         ltelementtype2c langfrgtnotuniquedataltelementtype2cgt         lt ... gt         ltelementtypeNxMgtuniquedataltelementtypeNxMgt     ltinfotype1gt     ltinfotype2gt         ltelementtype1agtrepeatdatainfotype1element1altelementtype1agt         ltelementtype2agtnotuniquedataltelementtype2agt     ltinfotype2gt     lt ... gt     ltinfotypeNgt         ltdescendantsgtltdescendantsgt     ltinfotypeNgt ltdocgt codepre  pDesired outputp  precodeltdatatablesgt     lttable idelementtype1gt         ltelementtype1a id1gtuniquedataltelementtype1agt         ltelementtype1b id2gtuniquedataltelementtype1bgt         lt ... gt         ltelementtype1N idMgtuniquedataltelementtype1Ngt     lttablegt     lttable idelementtype2gt         ltelementtype2a id1gtuniquedataltelementtype2agt         ltelementtype2b id2gtuniquedataltelementtype2bgt         lt ... gt         ltelementtype2N idMgtuniquedataltelementtype2Ngt     lttablegt     lttable idelementtype2frgt         ltelementtype2a langfr id1gtuniquedataltelementtype2agt         ltelementtype2b langfr id2gtuniquedataltelementtype2gt         lt ... there are five languages gt         ltelementtype2N langfr idMgtuniquedataltelementtype2Ngt     lttablegt     lt ... gt     lttable idelementtypeNgt         ltdescendantsgtltdescendantsgt     lttablegt ltdatatablesgt codepre  pand p  precodeltintermediarytablesgt     lttable idintermediarytabletype1xtype2gt         ltelement id1gt             lttype1IDgt1lttype1IDgt             lttype2IDgt1lttype2IDgt         ltelementgt         ltelement id2gt             lttype1IDgt1lttype1IDgt             lttype2IDgt2lttype2IDgt         ltelementgt         ltelement id3gt             lttype1IDgt2lttype1IDgt             lttype2IDgt1lttype2IDgt         ltelementgt         ltelement id4gt             lttype1IDgt2lttype1IDgt             lttype2IDgt2lttype2IDgt         ltelementgt         lt ... gt         ltelement idNgt             lttype1IDgtMlttype1IDgt             lttype2IDgtZlttype2IDgt         ltelementtype2Ngt     lttablegt      lttable idintermediarytabletypeMxtypeNgt         ltdescendantsgtltdescendantsgt     lttablegt ltintermediarytablesgt codepre  pI have also seen many very similar questions asked, and I have some resources that I gathered from them and read p  ul lia hrefhttpwww.ibm.comdeveloperworksxmllibraryxxmlphp1index.html relnofollowhttpwww.ibm.comdeveloperworksxmllibraryxxmlphp1index.htmlali lia hrefhttpwww.php.netmanualensimplexmlelement.addattribute.php relnofollowhttpwww.php.netmanualensimplexmlelement.addattribute.phpali lia hrefhttpwww.learnxslttutorial.com relnofollowhttpwww.learnxslttutorial.comali lia hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms256103.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms256103.aspxali lia hrefhttpphp.netmanualenclass.domdocument.php relnofollowhttpphp.netmanualenclass.domdocument.phpali ul  pThese are the most useful linksp  ul lia hrefhttpwww.capcourse.comLibraryNormalizingXMLPart1.html relnofollowhttpwww.capcourse.comLibraryNormalizingXMLPart1.htmlali lia hrefhttpforums.tizag.comshowthread.phpt17821 relnofollowhttpforums.tizag.comshowthread.phpt17821ali ul  pAnd I found that none of the applications of the questions were able to produce the result I am trying to achieve.

Negative 1609 pIs Javascript intended to be running as little as possible on a websitewebapp By that I mean is the usual intention to run through all your js files as soon as the page loads and put them aside, and then when functions come up to execute them right away and be done with itp  pIm working on a project using google maps and I have a custom marker object scripted out, and a debugger has told me that the browser runs through all my js files before anything even appears on the page. p  pMy problem comes in here I wanted to animate certain markers to bounce up and down continuously with jQuery similar to OS X icons in the dock and my several attempts at infinite loop functions all just crash the browser. So I understand that the browser doesnt like that, strongbut is there a way to have a simple script be repeating itself in the background while the user navigates the pagestrong Or is Javascript just not supposed to be used that wayp  pI worked with Flash for a long time so my mindset is still there.p

Negative 1609 pI have the following queries the first as a count for pagination, the second to fill the resulting table with data. They both worked very well, but I want to add Ordering functionality to the table also, and have made some hamfisted efforts in that direction. p  pEssentially, I have broken up the MySQL query into portions stored in variables, which may or may not be assigned based on the wishes of the user as expressed by the submitting and GETting of forms. Im only at a beginner level, and this is what made logical sense to me. It is probably not the correct methodp  pThe data is ordered by default as it is entered in the database. The table is filled 15 rows at a time. Ideally, the user could then choose to order the animals data in another way  by age, or colour, for example. The choice is made via submitting a form to the page itself, the query is resubmitted, and the result is outputted in 15row pages again.p  pSo far, here is my codep  pPAGINATIONp  precodegenderid  GET[groupid] sortby  GET[sortby]    if issetGET[pageno]  pageno  GET[pageno]      else  pageno  1       initialcount  SELECT count                  FROM profiles                 WHERE ProfileName  Unknown          if genderid gt 0              genderquery   AND ProfileGenderID  genderid                                       if sortby  age              orderby   ORDER BY ProfileYearOfBirth ASC                       elseif sortby  colour              orderby   ORDER BY ProfileAdultColourID ASC                   finalcount  initialcount .   . genderquery .   . orderby      result  mysqlqueryfinalcount or triggererror     querydata  mysqlfetchrowresult     numrows  querydata[0]      rowsperpage  15     lastpage  ceilnumrowsrowsperpage      pageno  intpageno     if pageno gt lastpage          pageno  lastpage          if pageno lt 1          pageno  1           limit  LIMIT  .pageno  1  rowsperpage ., .rowsperpage       if pageno  1                       echo ltp classpaginationgt             echo ltspan classfirstgtltlt Firstltspangtltspan classpreviousgtlt Previousltspangt               else                          echo ltp classpaginationgt             echo ltspan classfirstgtlta hrefSERVER[PHPSELF]pageno1gtltlt Firstltagtltspangt             prevpage  pageno1             echo ltspan idclassgtlta hrefSERVER[PHPSELF]pagenoprevpagegtlt Previousltagtltspangt               echo ltspan classpaginationnavgt .

Negative 1609 pWe need to store many rows in a MySQL InnoDB table, all of them having a 8byte binary string as primary key. I was wondering wether it was best to use the BIGINT column type which contains 64bit, thus 8byte, integers or BINARY8, which is fixed length.p  pSince were using those ids as strings in our application, and not numbers, storing them as binary strings sounds more coherent to me. However, I wonder if there are performance issues with this. Does it make any differencep  pIf that matters, we are readingstoring these ids using hex notation like pageid  0x1122334455667788. We wouldnt use integers in queries anyway, since were writing a PHP application and, as you surely know, there isnt a unsigned long long int type, so all integers are machinedependant size.p
Negative 1609 pI have an app where I am programmatically controlling Bluetooth pairing and unpairing.  I can pair before connection and unpair afterwards.

But this is in fact unnecessary, because by the time the user sees this, my app has already used codesetPincode.  Id really like for that notification to either a not appear at all, or b be dismissed automatically somehow.p  pI realize this may not even be possible, but I thought I would ask in case someone has a creative idea.p

For example if I have an Integer array like thisp  precodeidsType   2, 3  codepre  pand I have a list codearrayOfIdscode with 5 elements, then when I use the codescheckboxlistcode, 5 checkboxes will be shown and the second and third checkbox will be checked.p  pBut if I do this using codesjcheckboxlistcode, then only the first checkbox will be checked and also the checkboxes will change dinamically according to the codesjselectcode value, which wont happen when I use a codescheckboxlistcode.p  pIm really lost as to how can I solve this issue, if anybody can help it will be very much appreciated.p

Negative 1609 pI am having a problem with codestrncpycode copying an extra character at the length I need. I need to copy the 10 most significant bits from one string to another both in codecharcode format.p  pThe size of the larger variable does not intuitively matter, and the smaller only affects the output when it is significantly smaller than the value I need I dont know why this is either.p  pThe n value in my codestrncpycode may be whats causing the problem, but I have no idea why its acting the way it is. If Im not mistaken, n, the length of the destination string, should be 1 longer than the data, to account for the null character at the end.p  pMy string is not behaving this way at all.

Negative 1609 pI keep having troubles with my NSTimers and background selectors. It is driving me nuts and takes a very long time to try out each tweak. To preserve my sanity, and the sanity of future generations of cocoa programmers, Im asking this questionp  pIs there an absolutely 100 sure way to have a scheduled, longterm timer fire at a later point in time, regardless of whether it was called from a background thread, main thread, etcp  pIt seems that I keep having to solve the same problem over and over again for the majority of my classes that use NSTimers. they work during shortterm testing, lets say I set the timer to fire through a background thread to fire in 10 seconds. It works, because theres still a run loop running. But once I change the fire time to what I really want, like 1530 minutes, theres dead silence. The run loop is gone and I dont know how to handle such a case. Nothing happens, and I discover such bugs a few days later, once Ive already forgotten which timer would be responsible for that. p  pCurrently Im doing some really, really ugly dance with selectors, for example heres a test methodIt seems to work for 10 minute timersp  precodethis is a test method to simulate a background task requesting a timer   [self performSelectorInBackgroundselectorbackgroundReminderLongTermTest withObjectnil]  this is a method similar to the one that the background thread would be trying to invoke     voidbackgroundReminderLongTermTestidsender              [self performSelectorOnMainThreadselectorbackgroundReminderFromMainThread withObjectnil waitUntilDoneNO]       this is a wrapper for the background method, I want the timer to be added to a thread with a run loop already established and running     voidbackgroundReminderFromMainThreadidsender                  [playTimers addObject[NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval1800 targetself selectorselectorstart userInfonil repeatsNO]]       codepre  pI like the convenience of not having to worry about creating a fire date object with the scheduled timers, but should I just forget about them and use timers with specific fire dates It seems that the scheduledTimer works well for short term tasks, when the run loop is already present, but I simply cannot see this kind of bugs during the apps execution. At one point, it seems that the timers are firing normally, but at a later point they stop firing completely.p  pThank you for any help or clarification. strongIm looking for a method that schedules timers without having to worry about whether or not a run loop is present every time I need to schedule a timer. I want to be sure that as long as the app is running, my timers, scheduled through this method would fire at predictable points in the future .strongp

Negative 1609 pWe have a feature similar to the Related questions on SO where we show related records when viewing a given record. The related records were being retrieved by calling the db every time the page was loaded. To reduce the load on the db, I created a static List of these records which I load on ApplicationStart and am now using Linq query to query this List. p  pFor the most part this seems to work fine. The load on the db has reduced and the Sql profiler shows there are no more related records query. I had pushed this change last night and this morning I found the IIS worker process to be with CPU at 100 and the website unresponsive. I switched back to the old code where I query db and things were fine on the web server but db load increased. So I switched to the new code again and have been looking at the cpu load on the web server. This is what I noticed.p  pWhen using the old code which queries the db, the cpu usage of the IIS Worker process is negligible and there are hardly any variations straight line seen in the performance tab of task manager However, when using the new code which creates and queries the static List, I see spikes in the cpu usage of the IIS worker process. Mostly it is between 1 and 5  but every now and then it spikes over that and the max I have seen is 40 since I started observing. I am wondering why this is happening and whether under heavy load, this could have resulted in the worker process crashingp  pHere is some of the code which is querying the static Listp  precode    if validSearchLatLong ampamp usePincodeLatLong  distanceFilterLimit  distanceLimit                      filteredRecords  StaticRecords.Wherejob gt LatLongDistancecenterLatitude, centerLongitude, job.lat, job.lon lt distanceFilterLimit  string.IsNullOrEmptythis.PreferredJobCity  job.city  this.PreferredJobCity  false.ToList                  else                      filteredRecords  StaticRecords.Wherejob gt this.PreferredJobCity    job.city  this.PreferredJobCity  this.City    job.city  this.city  state    job.state.Trim  state.Trim  false.ToList                   if RecordsearchFilter.JobCategories.Count gt 0 ampamp RecordsearchFilter.EnableFilter                      filteredRecords  filteredRecords.Wherejob gt this.RecordsearchFilter.JobCategories.Containsjob.JobCategoryClass.ToList                  else                      filteredRecords  filteredRecords.Wherejob gt MatchJobCategoriesjob.JobCategory, shortthis.jobCategory.SqlId gt 0.ToList          codepre  pList supports multiple concurrent readers, so StaticRecords should not be the blocking factor. And after that I am creating filteredRecords which is a new filtered List which should be independent of other threads. p  pWhat could be the possible reasons for spikes in CPU and could it have resulted in the earlier crash of the IIS worker process p  pEDITp  pI now know that the crash was not caused due to this code, but another bug. The static List approach has been stable and seems to have worked well to achieve its purpose. p  pBut my question still remains, why the spikes in CPU p  pWhen I say p  blockquote   pList supports multiple concurrent readers, so StaticRecords should not   be the blocking factor.

Negative 1609 pQuestion Regarding Eclipse plugin development, what is the distinction between actions bars vs. menus, toolbars... when adding actions in particular, to a Java Editorp  pI would like to add actions to a Java editor in Eclipse.

Negative 1609 pApologies if this is classic ASP 101, but its been so long since I did any ASP Im struggling to understand  track this error down. What makes it worse is Ive inherited this application and I cant ask the original author..p  pI have a shopping cart that includes an input checkbox and numerous other fields. When the form is processed and submitted it is run through some javascript and then if all is ok, redirected to another page. Nothing unusual there. Firebug shows that at this point the value of the check box is different depending on its checked state.p  pWhen the form is submitted it goes to another page that iterates over the session.Contents collection, and builds up a string that is sent to a 3rd party. Using fiddler, it appears that whilst the name of the checkBox is in this string, the value is always on p  pFrom reading Google, I see that the session.Contents collection is all parameters that have been placed in the session  application. but a grep across all the files in the project directory doesnt turn up anywhere that the checkbox is added to the session.p  pSo, is the cb there simply because it is on the form or used in javascript, or are there other ways of adding the variable into the session. Grep on the name doesnt turn up any other instances.p  pAnd secondly, if the variable is in the session, no matter how it got there, why is it always set to on. Im assuming that somehow it has been added to the session and set to On before the form is processed. But the checkbox defaults to unchecked, so Im confusedp  pCan anyone help explain this, or even suggest how I can track it down  fix it. The obvious answer is to try to force it into the session with the correct value, but Id like to know why it is misbehaving rather than just ignore it in case I meet something like this againp  pThanksp

Negative 1609 pI am testing an existing application in the Windows 8 consumer preview and it crashes upon launching.

However, the same site has a list of a hrefhttpsocial.technet.microsoft.comwikicontentsarticleswindows7wmiclasseswithmethods.aspxWindows 7 WMI classes and methodsa too, and these arent in that either Even though it works on Windows 7 no problem.p  pSo from the look of that, it is not supported.  p  pThe MSDN for the ManagementClass indicates that the method a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary15s5468528vvs.11029.aspxis still present in .NET 4.5a.  Additionally, a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa38927328vvs.8529.aspxthis Microsoft resourcea does explicitly list Win32Processor and Win32NetworkAdapterConfiguration, with the methods I need.p  pSo, from the links, you can see I have tried to research this, so this is my last stop in trying to solve this mystery.p  pMy app is originally a .NET 2.0 solution created in Visual Studio 2005.  I have installed Visual Studio 2011 Beta into my Windows 8 Consumer Preview VM, along with the latest SQL 2012 Express.

Therefore I cannot debug this issue on the machine itself.p  pSo my question is specifically do these classes exist in Windows 8  If they do, then what am I doing wrong  If they dont, then I need to find out a way to still get this information  but I guess thats a separate question p

Negative 1609 pI have seen plenty of discussion regarding the fastest way to select a first child element using jQuery.  As can be expected, the native DOM firstChild property is much faster than using a jQuery selector or combination of selectors  see a hrefhttpjsperf.comjqueryfirstchildselectionperformance6 relnofollowhttpjsperf.comjqueryfirstchildselectionperformance6a.  This is not usually a problem  either its being used in a place where performance is not a big deal, or its easy enough to just access the DOM element and use its .firstChild property.  However, there are a couple problems with thisp  ul lifirstChild could return a text or comment node, rather than an element, as a jQuery selector would returnli liIf I need to select the first child of multiple elements, I must either use a slow selector, or go to a lot of extra work iterating over DOM elements, adding them to a collection, then putting them back into a jQuery object.li ul  pIt seems to me that the cost of adding a firstChild method to the core jQuery library would be far smaller than the benefits.  I took my own shot at creating such a method for my own usep  precode.fn.firstChild  function      var ret  []      this.eachfunction          var el  this.firstChild          the DOM firstChild property could return a text node or comment instead of an element         while el ampamp el.nodeType  1             el  el.nextSibling          if el ret.pushel           maintain jQuery chaining and end functionality     return this.pushStackret  codepre  pIn the tests I created at a hrefhttpjsperf.comjquerymultiplefirstchildselection relnofollowhttpjsperf.comjquerymultiplefirstchildselectiona, this function performs more than five times faster than any other option.  The tests are based on the tests mentioned above, but are selecting the first children of multiple elements, rather than a single element.p  pIs there something I am missing  A technique that I should be using  Or is this an issue than one should never worry about  Is there a reason to not include a function like this in jQueryp

Negative 1609 pI want to implement a webapp  a feed that integrates data from various sources and displays them to users. A user should only be able to see the feed items that he has permissions to read e.g. because they belong to a project that he is a member of. However, a feed item might and will be visible by many users.p  pId really like to use CouchDB mainly because of the cool changes feed and mapreduce views. I was thinking about implementing the app as a pure couchapp, but Im having trouble with the permissions model. AFAIK, there are no perdocument permissions in CouchDB and this is commonly implemented using peruser databases and replication.p  pBut when there is a lot of overlap between what various users see, that would introduce a LOT of overhead...stuff would be replicated all over the place and duplicated in many databases. I like the elegance of this approach, but the massive overhead just feels like a dealbreaker... Lets say I have 50 users and they all see the same data....p  pAny ideas how on that, please Alternative solutionp

Negative 1609 pRight now Im working on a application that spreads data between two different storage mediums, particularly SQL and SharePoint. In specific, the application tracks Projects in SQL and then generates an associated website in SharePoint for each project, storing the URL of the site in SQL.p  pRight now my domain consists of a bunch of POCO entities representing the data stored in SQL. NHibernate handles the persistence piece of all of these entities. The one exception is the Website entity, which is a POCO representing a website in SharePoint. Ive written a custom SharePointDataContext class which allows me to load websites, track changes to sites once theyve been loaded, and then persist those changes back to SharePoint with a method call on the SharePointDataContext class. Basically the whole class is like a very simplified Session object for the Website class only.p  pCurrently, theres no direct relationship between Website and Project. Instead the Project contains a property SiteUrl which I can pass into my SharePointDataContext like so p  precodeWebsite web  SharePointDataContext.GetWebsiteByUrlProject.SiteUrl codepre  pWhat Id like to do is rewrite my project class the have a Property like thisp  precodepublic class Project      public virtual Website Web get protected set    ... Other Properties ...  codepre  pAnd then let NHibernate handle lazy loading the site from SharePoint as needed. Then whenever the session gets flushed, I want NHibernate to handle invoking the save method on my SharePointDataContext.p  pI suspect the answer has something to do with CustomTypes, but what Im not clear about is how this will work with the object tracking piece of my SharePointDataContext. Right now, the way that class works, is that you have to load a Website from a given instance of the SharePointDataContext, make your changes, and then call save on the same instance of that context, like sop  precodevar context  new SharePointDataContext var web  context.GetSiteByUrlsiteUrl web.Title  New Title context.SaveChanges codepre  pIm not sure how I could have my IUserType implementation access the same instance of the SharePointDataContext during both the save and load events short of static objects or other nasty approaches. p  pIs there a way to handle this scenario where I need NHibernate to map certain properties to objects outside of the standard persistence mechanisms p

Negative 1609 pI am currently trying to develop an image uploading website by using CodeIgniter. The thing is, I came across an issue today and I would really appreciate any kind of help in order to solve it.p  pSo basically, the site is working. But the thing is, that the files are not private. A user may want to ensure that the files the users upload are only visible by them, and not by someone who just guesses a bunch of urls. eg. user1 uploads image1 which he wants to keep private, for himself [localhostlocalhostuploadscriptfilesimage1.jpg], user2 can access image1 by guessing and typing the url [localhostuploadscriptfilesimage1.jpg] which is what we dont want to happen.  I have done some research and I think that this would probably require another controller for serving the files which checks for session data.  I have been playing with sessions etc in PHP for quite some time in the past, but I am not that familiar with them in CodeIgniter. Is this the only way I dont think I need to create separate directories for each user, do I Can you please tell me how to head to the right direction or give me an examplep  pThanks in advance,p  pharris21p

But that argument doesnt apply in the other direction, as far as I know.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2576910howtoconvertadynamicdlltostaticlibHeresa someone saying its impossible to convert .dll to .a on Windows, but I think theyre just talking about the impossibility of breaking a .dll or .exe back up into its original .o files, not necessarily saying it would be impossible to create a linkable .o file with the same contents. Also, the situation on Windows is a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinebb985014.aspxslightly odder than real PICa, although I dont think thats relevant.p

Negative 1609 pI have a little problem with an interface.  A bunch of my classes implement the codeILayoutObjectcode interface.  A method declares a variable as codeILayoutObjectcode defaulting it as Nothing and then runs some code which decides which object it should be.

The object would be affected by the changes in the method and everything would be OK.  Howeverm, when using an interface, the variable in the calling code remains codeNothingcode and behaves like a normal variable.

Negative 1609 pI am working on a project that has to read and output barcode data. It uses a standard logitech camera to take a picture. It uses JavaCV Javas OpenCV package to access the webcam and take a picture. After the picture is stored, it then uses Zxing package to read and output the barcode data.p  pThe program works, but not well enough. It can handle a rather large barcode but cannot read anything normal size. My theory is that the resolution on the camera is not good enough. However, I would like to ask if anyone here knows how I could improve the barcode reader through code. i.e focusing the camera through JavaCV or somethingp  ptldr version Is there anyway I can improve image quality though JavaCV for the purpose of barcode readingp

Negative 1609 pIn my own answer for a hrefhttpcodereview.stackexchange.comquestions18997ajavascriptvmthatinterpretscodewritteninjsonA JavaScript VM that interprets code written in JSONa I stated that the public properties of a JavaScript closure cannot be accessed in a private function.p  pThe example given in that post is p  precodefunction anobject     var privatefunction  function         publicfunction wrong you have no access to it         console.logthis refer to the global object, not the object creating          this.publicfunction  function         console.logthis refer to the object creating       codepre  pI think the reason is for some backward compatibility issues codeprivatefunctioncode must belong to the global object. So the public function is only an anonymous function that assigned to a property of codethiscode. This explains why calling codepublicfunctioncode will fail because it need to have a reference to codethiscode first.p  pHowever, the following fix is still not workp  precodefunction anobject     var privatefunction  function         publicfunction wrong you have no access to it         console.logthis refer to the object creating     .bindthis     this.publicfunction  function         console.logthis refer to the object creating       codepre  pAs I explicitly specify that codeprivatefunctioncode should be bound with the object creating, calling codepublicfunctioncode should work but it does not. I have to do the followingp  precodefunction anobject     var privatefunction  function         this.publicfunction         console.logthis refer to the object creating     .bindthis     this.publicfunction  function         console.logthis refer to the object creating       codepre  pAnother workaround the way that I am using is the followingp  precodefunction anobject     var privatefunction  function         publicfunction         console.logthis refer to the object creating          var publicfunction  function         console.logthis refer to the object creating          this.publicfunction  publicfunction  codepre  pNow is the question part. What is the reason behind this behavior What is it trying to avoid by disabling access codethiscodes properties without explicit specificationp  pUPDATE the main part of the question is  When the interpreter cannot find a name in the scope chains, why shouldnt it have a look at the codethiscode propertiesp
Negative 1609 pI just wrote this simple methode that must return a double value. Its a function to withdraw money from the bank account. The function must let the user get the money only if he entries a value smaller than his the amount of money he has in his account. There is a condition where, if he is a special user, he can take the money even if he tries a value  balance1000.p  pAs Im a beginner to java, Im not yet familiar with this thing of types Im a php programmer, so I never really had to worry about this, but Im getting troubles to make this code work, because Im returning a double, if its ok, but a false, if its not, and I cant do this in java..

Negative 1609 pThis is a tricky one to describe but here goes.p  pA select control with a size  1 is positioned in the browser down the bottom of the screen such that there is a scrollbar present in the body and only the first item in the select control is visible the other items are there but you need to scroll the page down to see them.  There is an onclick event in the  select box or any parent above it but such does not fire when the select is clicked the first time.  What happens is that chrome automagically scrolls the page to show all the items in the select, but apparently forgets to pass the click event to the handler.p  pThis behavior only seems to occur in chrome. works fine in FF and IEp  pChrome developers are notoriously slow to fix bugs and especially given the obscure nature in this case, I suspect it will never be fixed.p  pUsing setTimeout in the onfocus event in addition to the onclick event solves the problem as the onfocus doesnt seem to be inhibited.  However I would like to find a less hacky solution if there is one.p  pIdeasp

Is there a good way to handle this  And if so, how to best implement thisp

Negative 1609 pis it possible to implement your own cast rules and to make the compiler give a warning about it rather than an errorp  pIm currently working with SFML doesnt really matter if you dont know it and it has a simple Vector2 structure like thisp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt struct Vector2      Vector2ltTgtT,T     T x,y  codepre  pNow Im using this quite often and would like to setup a custom cast rule for this structure, since I cant modify the source code. I currently have a function that needs a codeVector2ltintgtcode, but a function I use returns a codeVector2ltunsigned intgtcode and the compiler doesnt seem to be able to cast the one into the other which is a bit weird.p  pI know I can use the casts and codestaticcastcode works, but it seems a bit too elaborate for a a simple conversion like this, and a bit stupid that I cant test my program because of this. So what Im probably searching for are compiler commands that can setup such cast rules.p

Im using the a hrefhttpsimplehtmldom.sourceforge.net relnofollowPHP Simple HTML DOMa and it works with the normal scripts but not the one stored in CDATAblocks. Therefore, Im looking for a way to scrape data within the CDATAblock. Unfortunately, all the help I could find was for XMLfiles and Im scraping from a HTML file.p  pThe javascript Im trying to scrape is a followsp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt lt[CDATA[ var data  [value8.41,color1C5A0D,text1711,value9.86,color1C5A0D,text1811,value7.72,color1C5A0D,text1911,value9.42,color1C5A0D,text2011] ]]gt ltscriptgt codepre  pWhat I need to scrape is the valuevariable in the var data.p  pThe problem was that I tried to replace the CDATA string on an object.

Negative 1609 pIm trying to write simple application where I can swipe between photos like that standard gallery app on each device. Standard one demonstrates impressive performance  it displays next photo instantly while takes only about 15 MB of memory. It seems like it keeps next and previous images in memory so it doesnt have delay due to loading them from sdcard. I think that if the application keeps at least 3 codeBitmapcode objects of such size in memory, it will take much more than 15 MB. So how it works Dont use codeBitmapcode or what Thank you.p

I had to eventually restart the program to kill it I know of other ways of killing it but thats not the problem... p  pI monkey patching using gevent.monkey.patchall as well.

So a few words of explanation first I only compiled the program as executable and wanted to compare to my Lua code, which calls the isMandelbrot function from C. So I created a shared object to call it from lua  and had big time differences. But couldnt understand why they were growing with number of iterations. In the end found out that it was because of the fPIC. When I create a little c program which calls my lua script so effectively I do the same thing, only dont need the .so  the times are very similar to C without fPIC. So I have checked it in a few configurations over the last few days and it consistently shows two sets of very similar results faster without fPIC and slower with it. p
Negative 1609 pIn a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15868414realtimegitdiffthis questiona I am exploring how to go about monitoring my project directory for changes so that I can keep a terminal that shows an always uptodate git diff so that I can skip typing codegit diffcode over and over into the shell and further streamline my workflow. p  pSupposing that I have a sufficiently intelligent tool that knows exactly when the filesystem has changed, how can I go about disrupting the display of git diff The ultimate solution would be able to figure out where the current display is scrolled to, and rescroll to the same position where reasonable, as everything could potentially have been changed, of course. Im sure theres a way to find out how far down in the buffer you are with codelesscode and then pass that along with the new instance of it. p  pBut the question here is how do I programmatically control an interface that is strongalsostrong interactive Is this something that is possible to do Could I make use of certain heavyduty tools like tmux, to send input into the program In my experience of customizing tmux to do many things it does have the ability to receive commands from the shell and also to execute shell commands, and it does have a command which sends keys. p

Im coding in c.p  precodewrapper function int tableinordersuccessor      node  temp     temp  root     inordersuccessorroot, temp     Find the inorder successor int tableinordersuccessornode  root, node  temp      ifroot  NULL return 0      ifrootgtright  NULL              ifrootgtdata  tempgtdata                     inordersuccessorroot, tempgtright      inordersuccessorroot, tempgtleft      return tempgtdata  codepre  pThe idea I had was to get the function to go right once from the root and then continue left as far as possible.  To get it to go right once I want to only go right if my rootdata is equal to my tempdata  the data is just a randomly generated int.  p

Negative 1609 pI am trying to store an enum value in coredata, though I understand the way doing it with normal coredata.

Negative 1609 pMy app is currently parsing CSV files from a web service by using a combination of codecomponentsSeparatedByCharactersInSetcode and codecomponentsSeparatedByStringcode methods. As the files are quite large  1 mb on average, parsing takes a couple of seconds on an iPad, which is too slow. The memory footprint of my solution is an issue too I am holding the full text file in memory. This is why I am looking for a faster and more memoryefficient solution. I came across codeCHCSVParsercode which can parse codeNSInputStreamscode directly, e.g. p  precodeNSInputStream stream  [NSInputStream inputStreamWithFileAtPathfile]  CHCSVParser  p  [[CHCSVParser alloc] initWithInputStreamstream      usedEncodingampencoding delimiter] codepre  pemSource from the sample project on a hrefhttpsgithub.comdavedelongCHCSVParser relnofollowCHCSVParseraemp  pstrongMy questionstrongp  pHow can I get an codeNSInputStreamcode as the result of an codeNSURLRequestcode emCurrently I am getting the whole CSV file as a codeNSDatacode object and converting it to codeNSStringcode in order to parse it.emp  pCould I use the codeNSInputStreamcode from an codeNSURLRequestcode directly with codeCHSVParsercodep  pWould you generally recommend using codeCHCSVParsercodes codeinitWithInputStreamcode method with a codeNSURLRequestcode or rather download the document to memory and parse if after the full downloadp
Negative 1609 pIt seems to be all right. Authorization is working, and users get the roles. I protected the methods of using annotations for example PreAuthorizehasPermissionpost, READ , it works and I get access denied. I created a database in which he described the rights of users to objects. I created a database which contains the users permission on objects.p  pMy problem is that after the users authorization, it is not getting permissions, and even if the user has the authority to object, he gets access denied. Also, I noticed that after a user login in the log file of the server should get a string which will write what permission he got, but I have no such line.p  pPieces of my filesp

Negative 1609 pI am running into an issue deploying a website. Shadow copy is turned off after previous deployment issues with it and deploying the site.p  pSpecifically at deploy time I find that even after copying codeappoffline.htmcode and verifying that the siteapplication is offline, the files in codebin.dllcode are often locked.p  pWith shadow copy off I would still expect the locks on the dlls to be freed when the codeappdomaincode is unloaded on codeappoffline.htmcode appearance.p  pI have tried deploying a temporary codeweb.configcode found on codeStack Overflowcode which aims to prevent changes to codebincode being picked up immediately just before I try to delete the contents of codebincode I even pause for code10scode after copying the new codeweb.configcode.p  precodexml version1.0 encodingutf8 gt ltconfigurationgt   ltsystem.webgt     lthttpRuntime waitChangeNotification300        maxWaitChangeNotification300gt   ltsystem.webgt   ltsystem.webServergt     ltmodules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequeststrue  gt   ltsystem.webServergt ltconfigurationgt codepre  pI have confirmed with the handles util that my application pool codew3wp.execode process is the holder of a lock on the dlls so am assuming this is the reason why I cannot deleteoverwrite the files. If i manually recycle the app pool it frees it up and I am able to deploy just fine. Unfortunately as part of the deploy process copying the appoffline and changing the web.config are possible but performing codeIIScode appcmd recycles are not for permissionsgroup policy reasons so I really need to be able to free up this lock with just codeappoffline.htmcode and the web.config.p  pTurning shadow copy back on does solve this particular issue but if a lock is still held on the dll. However I wonder  and concerned if I am just postponing the problem. Unless the lock on the old dll is freed when the codeappdomaincode is loaded againp  pWhen copying the codeappoffline.htmcode the codew3wpcode process id doesnt change like it does with a hard recycle but I assume it is unloading the codeappdomaincode which should free the codebin filescode it has locked.p  pAnother interesting point is that this only appears to happen on our production servers, I cannot recreate it locally or on our devstaging sites. I dont believe there is any config difference with the codeapppoolscode or codeIIScode config but could this possible cause this behavior. p  pAlso to clarify codeshadowCopyBinAssembliescode has been set to false for over 3 years without this problem happening same deploy process so I really feel like something that happened recently caused this, but I have no idea what.  p  pThanks for any ideas on how to solve this or even what might be causing it.p  pI believe the server is codeIIS7code or code7.5codep

Negative 1609 pBefore I begin, I would like to express my appreciation for all of the insight Ive gained on stackoverflow and everyone who contributes. I have a general question about managing large numbers of files. Im trying to determine my options, if any. Here it goes.p  pCurrently, I have a large number of files and Im on Windows 7. What Ive been doing is categorizing the files by copying them into folders based on what needs to be processed together. So, I have one set that contains the files by date for long term storage and another that contains the copies by category for processing and calculations. Of course this doubles my data each time. Now Im having to create more than one set of categories 3 copies to be exact. This is quadrupling my data. p  pFor the processing side of things, the data ends up in excel. Originally, all the data was brough into excel. Then all organization and filtering was performed in excel. This was time consuming and not easily maintainable over the long term. Later the work load was shifted to the file system itself, which lightened the work in excel. p  pThe long and short of it is that this is an extremely inefficient use of disk space. What would be a better way of handling this p  pThings that have come to mindp  ol liOverlapping Folders ul liIs there a way to create a folder that only holds the addresses of a file, rather than copying the file. This way I could have two folders reference the same file. li liTo my understanding, a folder is a file listing the memory addresses of the files inside of it, but on Windows a file can only be contained in one folder.li ulli liMicrosoft SQL Server ul liNot sure what could be done here.li ulli liSymbolic Links ul liIm not an administrator, so I cannot execute the mklink command.li liAlso, Im uncertain about any performance issues with this.li ulli liA Junction ul liApparently not allowed for individual files, only folders in windows.li ulli liSearch folders .searchms ul liMaybe Im missing something, but to my knowledge there is no way to specify individual files to be listed.li ulli liHashing the files ul liCreating hash tags for all the files, would allow for the files to be stored once. But then I have no idea how I would handle the hash tags.li ulli liXML ul liMaybe I could use xml files to attach meta data to the files and somehow search using them.li ulli liDatabase File System ul liI recently came across this concept in my search. Not sure how it would apply Windows.li ulli ol
Negative 1609 pIm using PHP version 5.3.1 and CakePHP 2.3.8 with XAMPP on localhost, and only some errors are actually displayed. I can say for certain that no PHP syntax errors are displayed.  I cant figure out whats going on, but sometimes Cake will throw out an error, and other times it wont at all, but when this happens my browser will say No data received.p  pFor example, if I type the following, it will go to the No data received screen for sure p  precodeecho test   no semicolon codepre  pIve tried it on Chrome, Firefox and Safari so Im sure its not browser specific. I checked my errorlog file and for each time this happens, the error is something likep  precodechild pid 90396 exit signal Segmentation fault 11 codepre  pstrongUpdate  I got it workingstrongp  pI was sick of hunting it down for nearly an hour so I backed up all of my projects and uninstalled XAMPP and downloaded the latest version and its working now. Thanks for your advice. p
Negative 1609 pI am using codeactionbarsherlockcode and a codetabhostcode of fragments and in one of my tabs I display a fragment called codesegmentedControlFragcode that includes 4 segmented control buttonslabeled 2hrs, 8hrs, 24hrs and 1wk and a frame that takes up the rest of the screen. p  pWhen one of the buttons from the codesegmentedcontrolcode group is selected a codeasynccode request grabs some important info , the frame is replaced with a  new codevisualFragmentFragcode fragment which includes the important info from the request in as a extra. p  pIt works just fine, I can click each of the buttons from the segmented control group and they each load their own variation of codevisualTrendsFragcode just fine. I can even select a completely different tab and return and it will load up on the segmented control I last selected just fine. p  pThe problem only starts when I add this line of code inside codeonCreateViewcode of the codesegmentedControlFragcodep  precodesegmentText.checkR.id.buttonone codepre  pThe issues in the logcat when I add this line of code are null pointer errors all relating to context. While it does work if I leave out the line above I suspect the way I am managing fragments in codesegmentedControlFragcode is wrong as well.p  psegmentedControlFragp  precodepublic class

Negative 1609 pI have a decent background in C but Im new to Python. Im trying to write a basic program that allows the user to specify the number of shareholders in a company and then ask about each Shareholders rating in each of three qualities usefulness of work, significance of work, difficulty of work.p  pI want to store the users ratings on these three scales somewhere and then display it later. Im still not sure whether using 3 lists for each of the 3 qualities is the most efficient way of doing it. Anyway, what Ive tried to do in the following code is assign a variable codeuserremcode as the identifier using which new items in the list will be added. p  pSo, for example, the initial value of codeuserremcode is 0. So, my understanding is that codeusefulness[userrem]  inputcode should add the inputted value as the first item in the list. Then, as you can see in the code, the while loop progresses and codeuserremcode gets increased by 1. So I thought for the second iteration of the loop, codeusefulness[userrem]inputcode should add the inputted value as the second item in the list.p  pHowever, I keep getting the error codeIndexError list assignment index out of rangecode right after inputting the value to codeusefulness[userrem]code in the first iteration of the loop.p  pSo, my questions are as followsp  ol liIs using lists even the most efficient way of doing this li liWhat would be an alternative way to achieve what I want to achieveli liWould it be better to have a list for each shareholder with three items each for the three qualities instead of having 3 lists with an unknown number of items possibly infinite But if we have a list for each shareholder, then the number of lists may be unknown and possibly infinite even though the items in each list will be only 3.

Negative 1609 pSo, I have a two column layout and cant seem to get the height to work like I want. These both have content that needs to grow and cause the page to be scrollable  so fixed and absolute values are out. However, when using relative on these columns and their containing div and minheight percentages i.e. minimum of 100 so it always at least fills screen if no content present. However, it isnt working. The minheight isnt getting recognized and I get no height unless there is content.p  pI realize I could have a div thats in a fixed position and solely for background.

Negative 1609 pI have a text file with about 1000 values strings, to be precise, each of which has a key attached to it. The keys are not necessarily unique that is, there can be 5 values with the same key. I am creating a program that organizes this data into a tree such that each node of the tree is organized by its key, storing a list of that keys associated in the node. p  pI do not know how many values per key I can expect  it would probably be from 1 to 5, thereabouts. p  pAlso, once the values are stored, I will not need to perform any changes on them. I will only need to read them. p  pMy question is this p  pFrom a memoryusage standpoint, would it make more sense to use vectors or arrays of size 5 to store the values p  pUsing the vectors would mean that I would only need to store as many as I needed. However using an array would mean I dont have to use the vector object. Im not sure which one would be more efficient.p  pThank you very much for your time.p
Negative 1609 pI recently started using Android Studio instead of Eclipse.

Since Im making just a widget and not an activity the first two arent the right ones and the third one doesnt seem to be what I want either. p

Negative 1609 pId need to do an app that runs on google app engine that would be able to automatically create some image files from GWT graphics on server that would be later automatically attached in an email that would be automatically sent once a week.p  pBut as far as Ive investigated I see no possible way to do it on server, first off, I havent been able to use ImageCharts on google appengine I had to use ColumnCharts and LineCharts, so that would complicate the process to turn then into images, althoug I think it could be done although it could take a while, although maybe it would be impossible to do it.p  pBiggest problem I see is that Google App Engine has File IO absolutely banned, so although there might be a workaround, I guess its a difficult one, I know about blobstore, but from what Ive seen it just allows you to upload already existing files from you own PC, not to create new ones.p  pIs there something that could be donep

Negative 1609 pIm working on a video game for my project and im running into a animation problem. Basically im doing a Final Fantasy style game where your recharging your ATB bar and once its full, you can do a skill. So I have 3 functions here. The first one is clearing my ATB bar so that it resets. This code works. The second one is refilling the timebar by moving a DIV block into place. This works as well. The third function is my attack skill function, which also works except for the fact that it does not do both of these animation functions in the order I placed them.p  pIf you look below, youll notice I have the code to first run the clear ATB function, and then run the time bar function, hoping that every time I click the button it would reset my ATB. The problem is, it completely ignores the FIRST function and runs the second one. I tried switching them and same thing occurs. So basically Im stuck where my code will always ignore the first one and operate the 2nd one if both of my animation functions are in the code. So now Im confused on how to fix this because I want BOTH codes to work. They work separately and independently as it stands now, but when I combine them, only the 2nd one registers.  p  precode    5.

Negative 1609 pI have been working on a 2dimensional object creator program in python 3.2.5 that handles manipulations of arbitrary shapes and calculates collision detection between them. The program allows you to input a shapes coordinates, and from there it will do whatever else you want it to do draw the shape to the screen, expand the border, manipulate individual coordinates, make it symmetrical, etc..p  pBut Ive run into a problem when trying to calculate the interior angles of an arbitrary polygon. While the algorithms Ive used to calculate the angles technically output the correct angle, I have no way of telling whether or not the program spits out an interior angle or an exterior angle since the arbitrary shape the user inputs could have concave vertices.p  pOn paper this would seem like a piece of cake, since you can visualize the shape and you can interpret which angle is interior and exterior automatically. But since the program only stores the values of the coordinates and doesnt actually visually create the object to extrapolate data, this problem becomes a little bit trickier to solve.p  pSo my question isp  pWhat method should I use to calculate the angle between two lines and how should I go about using it to determine the difference between an interior and an exterior anglep  pFor example, if I have a shape that has coordinates 30,50,35,47,40,50,37,43,35,35,33,43 which ends up looking sort of like an upsidedown spire with a concave base, I can easily calculate the angles between the lines, but which angle I am calculating is a mystery.p

Negative 1609 pIn particular I am interested in using PostgreSQLs codejsoncode type. p  pThe core of the problem seems to be that there is no internal mapping in Eclipselink to codejsoncode  type. So, using a naive approach withp  precodeColumnname  json, columnDefinition  json public String getJson      return json  codepre  p... and trying to insert an object, I get an exceptionp  precodeInternal Exception org.postgresql.util.PSQLException ERROR column json is of type json but expression is of type character varying codepre  pFair enough I suppose. p  pLooking through the EclipseLink docs, it seems that the applicable customizations Transformation Mappings, Native Queries, Converters rely on the data being made up of the supported mappings numbers, dates, strings etc so it makes this quite awkward to get around using vendor specific types.p  pThe main reason this is so frustrating is that codejsoncode type in posgresql is expressed the same as textvarchar and I believe at the moment, but not forever is just an alias of that type  therefore the driver is more than capable of transmitting this, its just validation rules in my way. p  pIn terms of the solution, I dont mind losing portability in terms of being database agnostic and using vendor specific types but just want a solution that allows me to use a codejsoncode type as an attribute on a normal JPA Entity and retain all the other behavior it is accustomed to schema generation, merge, persist, transactional code p

As a result, the path for Person.php  is, codehttplocalhostclassesPerson.phpcode.p  pThe Person.php class contains a method, Hello.

Negative 1609 pI am running some node js unit tests using Istanbul cover test.js, where test.js is the master test file which will call the actual scripts in our codebase.

Pardon me if this is a dumb question, but how do I get it to show coverage for the actual files that the tests refer top

If this happens, how can I disablep  pI found thisp  blockquote   pTips for running Linux on a flash device by David Hrdeman   p      pIf you are running your NSLU2 on a USB flash key, there are a number   of things you might want to do in order to reduce the wear and tear on   the underlying flash device as it only supports a limited number of   writes.p      pNote this document currently describes Debian etch 4.0 and needs to   be updated to Debian squeeze 6.0 and Debian wheezy 7.0. Some of   the hints may still apply, but some may not.p      pThe ext3 filesystem per default writes metadata changes every five   seconds to disk. This can be increased by mounting the root filesystem   with the commitN parameter which tells the kernel to delay writes to   every N seconds.p      pThe kernel writes a new atime for each file that has been read which   generates one write for each read. This can be disabled by mounting   the filesystem with the noatime option.       Both of the above can be done by adding e.g. noatime,commit120,... to etcfstab. This can also be done on an   already mounted filesystem by running the commandp      pmount o remount,noatime,commit120 p      pThe system will run updatedb every day which creates a database of all   files on the system for use with the locate command. This will also   put some stress on the filesystem, so you might want to disable it by   addingp      pexit 0p      pearly in the etccron.dailyfind script.p      psyslogd will in the default installation sync a lot of log files to   disk directly after logging some new information. You might want to   change etcsyslog.conf so that every filename starts with a  minus   which means that writes are not synced immediately which increases   the risk that some log messages are lost if your system crashes. For   example, a line such asp      pkern.                          varlogkern.logp      pwould be changed top      pkern.                          varlogkern.logp      pYou also might want to disable some classes of messages altogether by   logging them to devnull instead, see syslog.conf5 for details.p      pIn addition, syslogd likes to write  MARK  lines to log files   every 20 minutes to show that syslog is still running. This can be   disabled by changing SYSLOGD in etcdefaultsyslogd so that it readsp      pSYSLOGDm 0p      pAfter youve made any changes, you need to restart syslogd by runningp      petcinit.dsyslogd restartp      pIf you have a swap partition or swap file on the flash device, you   might want to move it to a different part of the disk every now and   then to make sure that different parts of the disk gets hit by the   frequent writes that it can generate. For a swap file this can be done   by creating a new swap file before you remove the old one.p      pIf you have a swap partition or swap file stored on the flash device,   you can make sure that it is used as little as possible by setting   procsysvmswappiness to zero.p      pThe kernel also has a setting known as laptopmode, which makes it   delay writes to disk initially intended to allow laptop disks to spin   down while not in use, hence the name. A number of files under   procsysvm controls how this worksp      pprocsysvmlaptopmode How many seconds after a read should a   writeout of changed files start this is based on the assumption that   a read will cause an otherwise spun down disk to spin up again.p      pprocsysvmdirtywritebackcentisecs How often the kernel should   check if there is dirty changed data to write out to disk in   centiseconds.p      pprocsysvmdirtyexpirecentisecs How old dirty data should be   before the kernel considers it old enough to be written to disk. It is   in general a good idea to set this to the same value as   dirtywritebackcentisecs above.p      pprocsysvmdirtyratio The maximum amount of memory in percent to   be used to store dirty data before the process that generates the data   will be forced to write it out. Setting this to a high value should   not be a problem as writeouts will also occur if the system is low on   memory.p      pprocsysvmdirtybackgroundratio The lower amount of memory in   percent where a writeout of dirty data to disk is allowed to stop.   This should be quite a bit lower than the above dirtyratio to allow   the kernel to write out chunks of dirty data in one go.p      pAll of the above kernel parameters can be tuned by using a custom init   script, such as this example script. Store it to e.g.   etcinit.dkernelparams, make it executable withp      pchmod ax etcinit.dkernelparamsp      pand make sure it is executed by runningp      pupdaterc.d kernelparams defaultsp      pNote Most of these settings reduce the number of writes to disk by   increasing memory usage. This increases the risk for out of memory   situations which can trigger the dreaded OOM killer in the kernel.   This can even happen when there is free memory available for example   when the kernel needs to allocate more than one contiguous page and   there are only fragmented free pages available.p      pAs with any tweaks, you are advised to keep a close eye on the amount   of free memory and adapt the tweaks e.g. by using less aggressive   caching and increasing the swappiness depending on your workload.p      pThis article has been contributed by David Hrdeman   p      pGo back to the Debian on NSLU2 page.p blockquote  pa hrefhttpwww.cyrius.comdebiannslu2linuxonflash relnofollowhttpwww.cyrius.comdebiannslu2linuxonflashap  pSomeone has some more tipp

Negative 1609 pPlease can some Laravel intellectual point me in the right direction. In the interests of DRY and using Laravels awesome helpers etc I want to know if anyone has a solution to this  For registering a new user, all the examples and documentation I can find, seem to have a form which asks for email, username etc  The input is verified or not and a user is created and added to db. Some examples go on to send a welcome email to the new user. I have an issue with this process as anyone can sign up using any email address even if it is not theirs. Hence my desire to incorporate an email with an activation link to ensure ownership of the address before user activation.p  pAm I missing something or does Laravel have some sort of token generating function that can assist in generating a token andor emailing to a new user I have setup password reminders and see there is an awesome method  Passwordremind which generates a token etc and sends an email to the user, and was wondering if there is such a thing I could use for activation email.p  pIf not the only way I can see this being possible is to add 2 fields to the db token and useractivated then in controller when user is saved, gen a token somehow and save it and a value to the useractivated field. Then send out an email with a link to a controller which when clicked checks the token, matches the user and updates the useractivated field and logs the user on etc.p  pMany thanksp

Negative 1609 pMaking a game that uses an android tablet as a controller. Both the game and the controller being written in Flash  AS3.  Mostly it is working well. However, on occasion, the controller will just stop sending data. The server is receiving messages they are just blank.  I am using the accelerometer on the device to control the game, and send the angle at 50ms intervals. Sometimes I can play through all three game levels 10 times with no issue. And then once in a while Ill be playing and the accel data is blank.  Not sure what is happening... Im not getting a disconnect or other error  the server keeps replying showing that the clientMessage handler is being called  it just shows blank data.p

Negative 1609 pi am writing a program that parses xml files that hold tourist attractions for cities.  each city has its own xml and the nodes have info like cost, address etc...  i want to have a thread on a timer to check for new xml files or more recent versions of existing ones in a specific directory.  creating the thread is not the problem.  i just have no idea what the best way to check for these new files or changed files is.  does anyone have any suggestions as to an easy way to make do that. i was thinking of crating a csv file with names and date altered info for each file processed and then checking against this csv file when i go to check for new or altered xml, but that seems overly complicated and i would like a better solution.  i have no code to offer at this point for this mechanism i am just looking for a direction to go in. the idea is as i get xmls for different cities fitting the schema that it will update my db automatically next time the program runs or periodically if already running. p

That is, until there is some allocation happening in part c. p  pWhen the GC decides to cleanup the minor heap, the double pointer may become invalid. Since this can only happen to parameters in b, Id like to signal the GC do whatever you want, but never move the content in these blocks until I tell you so. Is there a way to achieve this using the OCaml API p

Negative 1609 pI am working with System.Speech.Recognition in VS2012 on Windows7 64 bit. p  pMy issue is that when a user starts to speak the recognition engine seems to listen to everything that was spoken i.e. the whole sentence Please close the active program and tries to match that whole sentence to my grammar. Due to reliability I dont want to have to match whole sentences and would like to listen only for key words, such as close and active program. p  pFrom what I understand, the engine will map the user input Please close the active program to a single correct response while I would like some way for it to recognize that there were multiple hits in that single input. p  pWhat I have now works fine if the user puts gaps between each word so they are all processed as individual inputs, but the issue is when you speak normally and it accepts the whole sentence as a single input. p  pIs there any way I can get the engine to detect just the key words out of the input without having to find a match in my grammar for the entire input or possibly a way to set up a regex in my grammarp  pI am using a simple SpeechRecognitionEngine with a Grammar built from Choices.p

Negative 1609 pData.frames seem to keep the underlying structure of the data, which can be inconvenient at times.  In particular, I have a data.frame constructed from two lists combined using rbind.  Because the underlying list structure is maintained, this means I cant easily pull a column vector from the data.frame and functions that are often run on column vectors dont work.  Is there a way to convert the underlying structure of a data.frame to a more predictable format.p  pHeres a simple examplep  precodedf1 lt data.framea  21, b  43            standard data.frame df2 lt data.framerbindlista  2, b  4,    sad data.frame                         lista  1, b  3 codepre  pA quick check of codestrdf1acode and codestrdf2acode show that the former is a vector and the latter a list. As such, this confounds some common things we might try to do with a data.frame, for example, trying to order the data.frame by ap  precodedf1[orderdf1a, ]   works fine df2[orderdf2a, ]   returns Error in orderdf2a  unimplemented                                type list in orderVector1 codepre  pI know I can work around these issues with unlist, e.g., codedf2[orderunlistdf2a, ]code, but Id really like to be able to make df2 act like df1.  Especially since it is likely, in my case, that someone else may end up using my code.  Is there a simply way to accomplish this without unlisting each column one after the otherp

Negative 1609 pI have a watchdog system service that monitors an OpenGL application for crashes, freezes, overheating CPUGPU, scheduled onoff periods, etc. When the application is not running, due to this being a kioskstyle deployment, I call codeBlockInputcode and power down the display with codePostMessageHWNDBROADCAST, WMSYSCOMMAND, SCMONITORPOWER, 2code. When the monitored application is running again, the display is unsuspended with codePostMessageHWNDBROADCAST, WMSYSCOMMAND, SCMONITORPOWER, 1code.p  pWell, it turns out that if the OpenGL application is launched with the display in low power mode, when the display comes on, vsync doesnt work in the application, regardless of graphics driver settings and calls to codewglSwapIntervalEXTcode. If the display is unsuspended before the application is launched with some delay to give it time to actually power up, vsync works just fine. Whats the fix here I need the display blanked so random people in the mall dont see the desktop while the application is launching, but I also need vsync because were seriously electrical power limited and it makes a huge difference running topend NVIDIA cards drawing a lot of juice.p  pThe vsync signal comes from the graphics card, not the monitor, so this makes no sense. Even if the graphics card doesnt send out a vsync signal during the low power display mode, why wouldnt OpenGL latch on to the signal once it reappears when codeSCMONITORPOWERcode is sent to unsuspend I really need a workaround, as I doubt Microsoft andor NVIDIA will fix this any time soon, if theyre even aware of it and Id be going on a fools errand trying to contact either  Im just some poor dev in the middle of nowhere.p

This works with the codeclientIdcode and coderedirectUricode that I captured from Fiddler from Power Query. I am pretty certain that to get it working with my clientId I need to give Dynamics Marketing permissions in the Azure Application Registration, permissions to other applications. The problem is Dynamics Marketing is not an application that is available to add and the Dynamics CRM delegate permissions does not have a role for Dynamics Marketing.p

The success callback can be put directly inside the codeservice.Barscode call as the first argument.

Negative 1609 pOn the DUT I have two channels each consisting of a data interface and a sideband interface. The transactions that are sent down these channels must in order but one channel can stall back while the other channel catches up. I.E I send transaction A down channel 0, transaction C down channel 1, but channel 1 will not accept transaction C until channel 0 has recieved transaction B.p  pFurthermore the data interface can be slower than the sideband interface on each channel and certain sideband transactions do not require data to be sent with them. p  pCurrently the tests are set up to create the individual data and sideband sequences, place them into queues then split the queues into the number of channels and send them. However this is becoming difficult to maintain with interface changes on the channels and varying number of channels per configuration. So ideally Id like to write the test sequence so that it has no knowledge of how many channels are there or what interface needs data for the abstract transaction.p  pThe top sequence should just generate sequences like thisp  precodeuvmdoopendatastreamsequence uvmdowithsenddatasequence, senddatasequence.packetnumber  0 uvmdowithsenddatasequence, senddatasequence.packetnumber  1 uvmdowithsenddatasequence, senddatasequence.packetnumber  2 uvmdowithsenddatasequence, senddatasequence.packetnumber  3 uvmdoclosedatastreamsequence codepre  pThe problem with this approach is that I do not want one channel to block the other or one interface to block the other unless both are stalled back. If I use a virtual sequence like above, the opendatastreamsequence may stall for that individual channel when I want to pipeline the senddatasequence into the other channel or it may stall on the sideband interface but I want to pipeline the senddatasequence data transaction onto the same channels data interface.p  pHowever Im struggling to figure out how to implement the arbitration between the subsequencers. I thought about sequence layering and the use of fifos to only stall when all interfaces are saturated in a kind of middle layer. Is there asny UVM tricks Im missingp

Negative 1609 pI was wondering if codesocket.setdefaulttimeoutcode set the codeSORCVTIMEOcode and codeSOSNDTIMEOcode socket options, so I tried thisp  precodeimport socket socket.setdefaulttimeout0.1  100 milliseconds c  socket.socket x  c.getsockoptsocket.SOLSOCKET, socket.SORCVTIMEO, 16  I think SORCVTIMEO uses a struct of two 8 byte ints,  the first being an amount of time in second and the  second an amount of time in milliseconds. So, I expect  x[8] to be a little endian 8byte int equal to 100. printx  this outputs a 16 bytes of 0. codepre  pSo pythons codesocket.setdefaulttimeoutcode doesnt work like I expect. So, I tried setting the codeSORCVTIMEOcode myselfp  precodeimport socket c  socket.socket c.setsockoptsocket.SOLSOCKET, socket.SORCVTIMEO, 0.tobytes8, little  100.tobytes8, little printc.getsockoptsocket.SOLSOCKET, socket.SORCVTIMEO, 16  The first 8 bytes are 0 as expected, but the last eight bytes as an int  is 4000, and not 100 codepre  pDoes anyone know why the value returned in codegetsockoptcode is different from the value I set with codesetsockoptcode Im using Ubuntu 14.04.1, and I looked at the man page for sockets in section 7, but I cant figure out what Im doing wrong. I know that when you set codeSORCVBUFcode, the OS doubles the size you specify. Is something similar going on here I dont want my sockets to block for 4 seconds.p

I want to filter the products with the available tags. I have a solution that is already working, but it shows signs of weakness with only 40k rows in the table. I want to optimise the underlying query, so it doesnt hurt me in the long run.p  pstrongThe table with the tagitem relationshipstrongp  precodeCREATE TABLE tagsassoc    associd int10 unsigned NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,   tagid int10 unsigned NOT NULL,   itemid int10 unsigned NOT NULL,   PRIMARY KEY associd,   KEY tagid tagid,   KEY itemid itemid  ENGINEMyISAM DEFAULT CHARSETutf8 codepre  pstrongThe way the page is supposed to workstrongp  ol lipThere is a huge list of tags. The user chooses a codetagidcode and the page is filtered to only show the codeitemidcodes tagged with that certain codetagidcode.pli lipThe backend examines the filtered codeitemidcodes and lists all the codetagidcodes that are available for further filtering.pli ol  pstrongQuery1  list of itemsstrong  p  precodeSELECT    itemid,    counttagid as count  FROM    tagsassoc  WHERE    tagid IN ...  GROUP BY    itemid  HAVING   count  ... codepre  pstrongQuery2  list of remaining tagsstrong  p  precodeSELECT   ta.tagid,   t.tagname,   COUNTta.tagid as count FROM   tagsassoc ta LEFT JOIN   tags t ON ta.tagid  t.tagid  WHERE    AND itemid IN ...   AND ta.tagid NOT IN ... GROUP BY   ta.tagid codepre  pstrongHow it worksstrongbr Lets say in the first round we choose codetagid  250code. This means Query1 will contain codeWHERE tagid IN 250code and codeHAVING count  1code. The returned list will contain the following itemids code1, 2, 3, 4, 5code.p  pNow to get the remaining tags we run Query2 with the following parameters codeAND itemid IN 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 AND ta.tagid NOT IN 250code.p  pThe users chooses an other tag from the remaining ones, lets say codetagid  300code. This means Query1 will contain codeWHERE tagid IN 250, 300code and codeHAVING count  2code. The returned list will contain the following itemids code1, 2, 3code.p  pTo get the remaining tags we run Query2 with the following parameters codeAND itemid IN 1, 2, 3 AND ta.tagid NOT IN 250, 300code.p  pstrongThe problemstrongbr When the user chooses the first tag, the returned itemid list can be quite long. This means that Query2 will be long too as it can contain the following codeAND itemid IN 1, 2, 3, ... 7500, 7501, 7502code. I had 37k character long queries. Regarding performance, it is not horrible, but it can cause hiccups. And this is with only 7k row in items table and 40k rows.p  pstrongWhat Ive already triedstrongbr I rewrote Query2 not to contain the long itemid list, but instead use a subquery much like the one in Query1 codeAND itemid IN SELECT itemid FROM tagsassoc WHERE tagid IN ... GROUP BY itemid HAVING COUNTtagid  ...code. Performance wise it was horrible, so I abandoned this alternative.p  pstrongCan someone guide me to a better directionstrongbr Sorry for the long post, I hope I made the problem as clear as possible.p

Negative 1609 pI read a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryIOsdocumentationSpriteKitReferenceSKLabelNodeRef relnofollowthe SKLabel class referencea and it says a SKLabelNode is a node that draws a string. I also read a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationUikitreferenceUILabelClassindex.html relnofollowthe UILabel class referencea and it says basically the same thing it shows a static text view. How is this different from UILabel and which should I use Is UILabel just for more ways of controlling the aspects of a text viewp

Negative 1609 pIve been reading the book a hrefhttpswww.safaribooksonline.comlibraryviewheadfirstdesign0596007124ch04.html relnofollowHead First Design Patternsa, which I have found to be a good introduction to design patterns. However, Ive got a question about a claim they make in Chapter 4p  pThey define the Simple Factory pattern as follows Java pseudocodep  precodepublic abstract class Product   Product characteristics  Concrete Products should subclass this      public class SimpleFactory      public Product createProduct          Return an instance of some subclass of Product       public class Store      SimpleFactory factory     public Product orderProduct         Product product  factory.createProduct          Do some manipulation on product         return product       codepre  pThe Factory Method is defined as follows class Product remains the same and is omittedp  precodepublic abstract class Store  Concrete Stores must subclass this and override createProduct     public abstract Product createProduct      public Product orderProduct         Product product  createProduct          Do some manipulation on product         return product        codepre  pThen the authors go on to claim that the Factory Method Pattern is much more flexible than Simple Factory, because while Simple Factory is a one shot deal, with Factory Method you are creating a framework that lets the subclasses decide which implementation should be used page 135.p  pNow I dont get why this is true. The way I see it, Simple Factory is, in some senses, slightly strongmorestrong flexible than Factory Method you can subclass the Simple Factory instead of subclassing the Store to get essentially the same behavior. You can even change the behavior at runtime if you wish The only disadvantage of Simple Factory I could think of is when the product creation depends on state variables of the Store class is this what the authors are calling flexibility, or am I missing somethingp

Negative 1609 pI used the Child Theme Configurator plugin to generate a child theme.  Only 2 files were generated into the child theme functions.php and styles.css.  Parent theme is pinstrap.  Child theme is pinstrapchild.  Both are in the wpcontentthemes. folder.  There is a file called loop.php in the parent theme and what I want to do is modify this file so that my nggallery code will show up.  I coped the loop.php file from the parent theme into the child theme and then renamed it to loopindex.php because thats what the file saysp  precode            ltphp          Run the loop to output the posts.

Negative 1609 pI know you can change the cell format in openoffice Calc to make a number appeardisplay a certain way, like 1236 if you enter 1236,  but the actual value seems to be just the number. The spreadsheet Im making needs to be read by a programme that I didnt make and probably cant alter so values in certain columns need to have an exact format, either 1252 or 1252, when its read into the programme, but the gathering nature of the environmental surveying data means its easy for people to overlook small details like that. Is there any way I can force Calc to change the actual value, not just the format the number displays as Or possibly just display an error if its entered the wrong wayp  pThanks.p

Negative 1609 pWe are looking at doing some data import. There is a very large complex sheet which has some items grouped together using borders around cells in one column. The only indication that the items are grouped is the fact the group is surrounded by a border. Items ungrouped have no left and right border on the cell may have top and bottom border as items above and below maybe grouped. As an initial exercise we want to add a column that displays true if an item is grouped. So if there is a border display a value like one. Does anyone know if this possiblep

How to do thisp  pIf there is a way to catch the Cloudwatch alarm event from within the instance running the application, then this might be an easy way to proceed, but I cant find out how to do that.  p  pThere is a similar question posted here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13389737howtorestartec2instancefromcloudwatchalarmHow to restart EC2 instance from CloudWatch alarma. In my case however, I dont think that Auto Scaling is a viable option because of licensing restrictions on some other software running on the instance.p  pIm running a windows based EC2 instance.p  pThanks, Yugp

Negative 1609 pIve creating a new game class that is basically a GUI for my game. Im wanting to add a mouselistener so that I can check when the user is clicking on different things. However, Im struggling to get the basics working. Here is what I have so far. The game class is significantly more complex but works fine, only the mouselistener does not.

Negative 1609 pI apologize for the question as I know I am asking it wrong.  Please edit. Here is the issue I ran into regarding nthchild property.  I am developing on a chrome browser and I have also tested this in IEs latest browser too.  p  pI came across the ability to target an nthchildn5 div and further select a class I wanted to set a property on.  Without a media query it works great.  p  phere is the code p  precodedivnthchildn5 .clearingthumbs li          paddingtop 0      codepre  pThe issue comes when I try to use a media query to do the exact same thing but start at n3. The media query works but the nth child selector is ignored. p  phere is the code p  precode media smallonly  divnthchildn3 .clearingthumbs li  paddingtop 0        codepre  pI know I am having this exact issue because when I add the media query and nthchild select a specific child property it works fine. p  phere is the code that works as normalp  precodemedia smallonly  .clearingthumbs linthchildn3  paddingtop 35px        codepre  pSo my question become is there anyway to do what I want by selecting the parent div and sub class the way I did originally.  I thought it was a really cool feature I figured out until the media query didnt work.  p  phere is the html p  precodeltsection classthumbnailsectiongt ltdiv classrow collapsegt ltdiv classsmall6

Negative 1609 pSo I have a view controller that has a codeUITableViewcode that covers the bottom half of the controller.  I have a button in the top section header that allows the user to minimize or maximize the codeUITableViewcode.  When the button is pressed the y component  of the codeUITableViewcodes position is modified so that the codeUITableViewcode appears to have minimized to the bottom of the screen.  When the button is pressed while the codeUITableViewcode is in its minimized state the codeUIableViewcodes y position is returned to its original value. Both the maximizing and minimizing of the codeUITableViewcode are animated to provide a smooth transition between the opened and closed states of the codeUITableViewcode.p  pThis all works very nicely and provides a user experience that allows the user to utilize the information displayed in the table view and the information displayed within the view controller behind it.  The problem comes when a second controller is presented over top.  For some reason when the user dismisses the second controller the table view always returns to its initial position regardless of the position it was in at the time the second controller was presented.  This creates many issues as the initial view controller still thinks the table view is in the position it was at the time of presentation.  Why is this Why are the positions of components reset when a view controller is presented over top and then dismissed p  pHere is how I defined my codeUITableViewcode as a propertyp  precodeproperty nonatomic, strong IBOutlet UITableView reviewTable codepre  pHere is how I minimizemaximize my table viewp  precode IBActionbtnExpandCompressidsender      UIImage downImage  [UIImage imageNamedarrowDown.png]     UIImage upImage  [UIImage imageNamedarrowUp.png]     UIButton btnExpandCompress  UIButton sender     [btnExpandCompress setEnabledNO]      global flag to tell if the table view is maximized or minimized     if showingReviews              [UIView animateWithDuration0.7 animations             CGRect frame  reviewTable.frame             frame.origin.y  reviewTable.frame.size.height  30             reviewTable.frame  frame          completionBOOL finished              showingReviews  NO             [btnExpandCompress setEnabledYES]             [btnExpandCompress setBackgroundImageupImage forStateUIControlStateNormal]         ]          else              [UIView animateWithDuration0.7 animations             CGRect frame  reviewTable.frame             frame.origin.y  reviewTable.frame.size.height  30             reviewTable.frame  frame          completionBOOL finished              showingReviews  YES             [btnExpandCompress setEnabledYES]             [btnExpandCompress setBackgroundImagedownImage forStateUIControlStateNormal]         ]       codepre  pIf there is any other information needed to answer this question please let me know.p

Negative 1609 pWe have a large web based application that is built on ASP.Net MVC. We also have a public website that is just HTMLJavascript except for a couple places where we need to submit some information for back end processing. Case  1 is a simple contact form submission. If that was the extent of it, Id just process the from via PHP and be done. Case 2, however is more complicated. I need to save data to a database, run a Crystal Report, export the report as a PDF, email the PDF, and send results back to the browser. I already have the ability to do all these tasks on the ASP.Net MVC application. So heres my question. How do I leverage the code I already have in .Net MVC my web app from my public HTMLJavascript site p  pI do not want to use ASP.Net MVC on the public site because I dont want to change the routing of the public website.p  pI have identified two possibilities so farp  p1 Submit to a webforms ASPX page. The downside of this approach is that the Web Forms way of doing things creates extra files that I dont need such as designer files, plus I have to consider things like viewstate and postback.p  p2 Create a Web Service. I dont really know a lot about this, but I have done a little research. If I go this route do I use WCF Service or a Web Service What are the pros and cons of using this method over the above listed method of submitting to an ASPX page Is a webservice overkill for what I am trying to dop  pAre there other alternatives besides what I have thought ofp  pNote I am only interested in the server side aspect of this. I already know I will be using JQuery and AJAX to submit the post and receive back the results. Also business logic is already in a seprate project so that is not a concern either.p

Negative 1609 pI am trying to solve regression task using recurrent neural network I use pybrain to build it. After my network is fit I want to use it to make predictions. But prediction of recurrent network is affected by its previous prediction whih in turn is affected by prediction before it etc.p  pQuestion is  once network is trained and I want to make predictions with it on a dataset, how to properly kickstart the prediction process. If I will just call .activate on first example from a dataset for predictions that means that the recurrent connection will pass 0 to network and it will affect the subsequent predictions in an undesireable way. Is there a way to force fully trained recurrent network to think that previous activation result was of a some special value If yes, which value is the best here maybe mean of possible activation output values or smth like itp  pUPDATE. Ok, since no one had any ideas within a day on how to do this with recurrent network in pybrain, let me maybe a bit change a formulation to forget about pybrain. Consider that I build a pybrain network for regression for example, predicting price of a stock. Network will be used with a dataset which has 10 features. I add one additional feature into the dataset and fill it with previous price of from a dataset. Thus I replicate a recurrent network aditional input neuron replicates recurrent connection. The questions arep  p1 In the dataset for training I fill this additional feature with previous price. But what to do with the FIRST record in a training dataset I dont know previous price. Should leave it 0 It should a bad idea, previous price WAS NOT zero. Should I use mean of prices in training dataset Any other suggestions 2 Again, same question as 1 but for running fully trained network against test dataset. While running my network against test dataset I should always pick up its prediction and put the result into this new 11th input neuron before making next prediction. But again, what to do when I need to run first prediction in dataset since I dont know previous pricep

Negative 1609 pBefore getting into my issue, please have a look at this image.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comw9r4S.png altenter image description herep  pHere is the actual data model img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUyJhv.jpg altdata modelp  pI retrieve a set of Records from a web API, create objects out of them, save them in core data  and display them in the Today view. By default these records are returned for the current date.p  pThe user can tap on Past button to go to a separate view where he can choose a past or future date from a date picker view and view Records for that selected date. This means I have to call the API again passing the selected date, retrieve the data and save that data in core data and display them. When the user leaves this view, this data should be discarded.p  pThis is the important part. Even though I get a new set of data, the old original data for the current date in the Today view must not go away. So ifwhen the user returns to the Today view, that data should be readily available as he left it without the app having to call the API and get the data for the current date again.p  pI thought of creating a separate codeNSManagedObjectContextcode to hold these temporary data. p  pI have a separate class called codeDatabaseManagercode to handle core data related tasks. This class initializes with an instance of NSManagedObjectContext. It creates the managed object classes in the given context.p  precodeimport CoreData import Foundation import MagicalRecord import SwiftyJSON  public class DatabaseManager       private let context NSManagedObjectContext      initcontext NSManagedObjectContext          self.context  context           public func insertRecordsdata AnyObject, success  gt Void, failure error NSError gt Void          let json  JSONdata         if let records  json.array              for recordObj in records                  let record  Record.MRcreateInContextcontext as Record                 record.id  recordObj[Id].int                 record.name  recordObj[Name].string                 record.date  NSDatestring recordObj[Date].string                          context.MRsaveToPersistentStoreAndWait             success                codepre  pSo in the Today view I pass codeNSManagedObjectContext.MRdefaultContextcode to codeinsertRecordscode method. I also have a method to fetch Records from the given context.p  precodefunc fetchRecordscontext NSManagedObjectContext gt [Record]      return Record.MRfindAllSortedByname, ascending true, inContext context as [Record]  codepre  pThe data is retrieved from the API, saved in core data and gets displayed successfully. All good so far.p  pIn the Past View, I have to do basically the same thing. But since I dont want the original data to change. I tried to do this a few ways which MagicalRecord provides.p  pstrongAttempt 1strong  codeNSManagedObjectContext.MRcontextcodep  pI create a new context with codeNSManagedObjectContext.MRcontextcode. I change the date in Past view, the data for that selected date gets retrieved and saved in the database successfully. But heres the issue. When I fetch the objects from core data, I get that old data as well. For example, each day has only 10 records. In Today view I display 10 records. When the fetch objects in the Past view, I get 20 objects I assume its the old 10 objects plus the new ones. Also when I try to display them in the tableview, it crashes with a strongEXCBADACCESSstrong error in the codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode method.p  precodeoverride func tableViewtableView UITableView, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath NSIndexPath gt UITableViewCell      let cell  tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierCell, forIndexPath indexPath as UITableViewCell      let record  records[indexPath.row]     cell.textLabel.text  record.name  EXCBADACCESS     cell.detailTextLabel.text  record.date.toString      return cell  codepre  pstrongAttempt 2strong  codeNSManagedObjectContext.MRnewMainQueueContextcodep  pThe app crashes when I change the date with the following error.p  pementityForName nil is not a legal NSPersistentStoreCoordinator for searching for entity name Recordemp  pstrongAttempt 3strong  codeNSManagedObjectContext.MRcontextWithParentNSManagedObjectContext.MRdefaultContextcodep  pSame result as Attempt 1.p  pstrongAttempt 4strong  From Hals a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma288925251077789Answera I learned that even though I create two MOCs, they both refer to the same codeNSPersistentStorecode. So I created another new store to hold the temporary data in my AppDelegate.p  precodeMagicalRecord.setupCoreDataStackWithStoreNamedRecords MagicalRecord.setupCoreDataStackWithStoreNamedRecordsTemp codepre  pThen when I change the date to get the new data, I set that temporary store as the default store like this.p  precodefunc getDatedate NSDate      let url  NSPersistentStore.MRurlForStoreNameRecordsTemp     let store  NSPersistentStorepersistentStoreCoordinator NSPersistentStoreCoordinator.MRdefaultStoreCoordinator, configurationName nil, URL url, options nil     NSPersistentStore.MRsetDefaultPersistentStorestore      let context  NSManagedObjectContext.MRdefaultContext     viewModel.populateDatabasedate, context context  codepre  pNote that Im using the default context. I get the data but its the same result as Attempt 1 and 3. I get 20 records. They include data from both the old date and the new date. If I use codeNSManagedObjectContext.MRcontextcode, it would simply crash like in Attempt 1.p  pI also discovered something else. After creating the stores in App Delegate, I printed out the default store name codeprintlnMagicalRecord.defaultStoreNamecode in the Todays view. Strangely it didnt print the name I gave the store which is strongRecordsstrong. Instead it showed emReports.sqliteem. Reports being the projects name. Weird.p  pWhy do I get the old data as well Am I doing something with when initializing a new contextp  pSorry if my question is a little confusing so I uploaded a demo project to my a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsaus177822puj7dmReports.zipdl0 relnofollowDropboxa.

Negative 1609 pI have gone through most of the links here on stackoverflow and i have some doubts regarding InApp Subscriptions and Google Wallet.p  pWhat i knowp  ol liInApp Subscriptions basically allows a user to be able to subscribe to an app, say for example if it offers one year trial period, then once thats over, Google automatically handles the subscriptions then after.li liGoogle Wallet, its a method that can be used to perform the purchase. strongWhat i dont understand is, can i use this method in order to allow users to use the app for one year, and then make them pay for the next yearsstrongli ol  blockquote   pBilling continues indefinitely at the interval and price specified for the subscription. At each subscription renewal, Google Play charges the user account automatically, then notifies the user of the charges afterward by email. For monthly and annual subscriptions, billing cycles will always match subscription cycles, based on the purchase date. Seasonal subscriptions are charged annually, on the first day of the season.p blockquote  pThis is what happens in my app  1. A user logs in, and i get a date that probably keeps track of the billing cycle  2. If the sessions expired, the user is asked to pay using the inApp Billing serivce  3. Based on TrivailDriveApp Example, where we have the success log printed on subscription, we update the date of payment.p  pSome questions i havep  ol lipAs per the quote from android, if the user is automatically subscribed to the service, and if a mail is sent to the user, does that mean that i would never be able to get a notification about the payment extension How do i sync that with the server thenpli lipIs my approach wrong in handling this kind of scenario Or do i have to select a different method of handling app extensionspli ol  pP.S There is no way of testing inapp subscriptions also. I wonder if i could do that without using real creditdebit card credentials.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI would also want to keep track of when the purchase or billing was done, if subscriptions are autorenewed, then should i take up the purchase flow as an InApp Product instead of an InApp Subscriptionp  pPlease help.p

Negative 1609 pI have implemented Google Maps JavaScript API v3 to contrive a custom store locator for my companys website. Let me start by saying that the code I have works for the strongtwostrong stores, but it would not be efficient or feasible if I added any more stores because of the hacky code used to make it work.p  pI am using the Google Maps Places Library to send place details requests to Google using the codegetDetailscode method. On the callback, I am receiving the codeInfoWindowcode information emname, address, locationem for each of my store locations.p  pI create a marker for each place, then use codegoogle.maps.event.addListenercode to coordinate the Place, Marker, and InfoWindow objects. strongThis is where I encounter problems.strong The emplace details requestsem are not always received in the same order they are sent which throws off the indexing of my buttons that have a codedatamarkercode attribute set to 0 and 1, respectively, to correlate to the map markers.p  pemIs there anyway to delay the second request until the first is finished or write the script in a way that maintains ordinal integrityemp  pThe first snippet of code below is my event handler to bind the codeclickcode listener to each button using the code.place.placeIdcode property of the marker rather than the strongpreferred techniquestrong of using the index of the codemarkerscode array the codemarkerscode array holds the emplace detailsem for the two stores.p  pstrongemNone of the demos or examples in the Google Maps API documentation Places Library delineate the procedure for multiple places.

Negative 1609 pI have a maybe slightly unconventional question. Im working on an app that has two different core data entities sessions and routines. Subsequently I have two different view controllers in interface builder to fill the attributes of those entities. The thing is that those two entities are identical aside from the fact that I need sessions to have a many to one relationship with a clients entity and routines to have no relationship. p  pThe question is this. Id like to use the same view controller in interface builder for both my session and routine classes, is there a way that I can programatically determine what class the interface builder viewcontroller is assigned to based on a segue identifier I know it would have to be some sort of codeif segue.identifier  myIdentifier   code for changing destination view controllers classcode statement but Im not sure what the code would be, and I also want to hear other suggestions of ways to possibly do this more efficiently.p  pThanksp

Negative 1609 pIve been using C for a while, and have done my share of webforms, but Im very new to MVC and I dont really know how to phrase this question to get help from the googles. p  pIm developing an MVC site backed by EF and just trying to get the hang of things. So I have a view which allows the User to Create an entity A. Entity A has a reference to entity B, its address, which in turn has a reference to entity C, the address region.p  pSo Ive figured out that I can create an Editor Template which can be injected into the Create view for entity A, and returns the A model with its entity B reference populated. I can do the same thing on the entity B template, injecting an editor template for entity C and getting back the correct entity in Bs reference property. p  pMy problem is that entity C is a rarely created entity. The User needs the ability to create one, and its a very trivial entity has name and countryenum, so I dont want the user to have to visit a special page just to create this entity after theyve figured out that the correct C entity isnt yet in the list, then come back to the page and reenter all the other fields they might have already filled. p  pHow can I create a conditional view or set of views, which will allow the user to either select an existing entity C, or create a new entity C if they need to, without leaving the Create  Entity A pagep  pFor clarity this is my current setupp  pEntityACreate.cshtmlp  precodeusing Html.BeginForm    Html.AntiForgeryToken   Html.HiddenForA gt A.ParentID   ltfieldsetgt     Entity A editors etc...

Negative 1609 pHello there guys and ladies, p  pRight now Im developing a contentproviding application, which should be able to get liveticking content.  So if content is uploaded to a server, the user should get the recent news. It dont have to be imediatly. Im more thinking of an APICalling method, which is doing an APICall every now and then. p  pBut whats more important right now The content is provided in a List. So after fetching the content ive an arraylist, which is filled with contentobjects.  Those contentobjects will have a timestamp. p  pI wanna create a timeline. The thing is, if there is new content coming in, it should be marked. for example in a different color. p  pSo imagine a timeline, when ur looking at the content. Then you put your phone away. and after you looked at the app again, there are e.g. 4 new contentobjects available. These 4 contentobjects should be marked in the timeline. p  pCan I dynamically color a listview or would you rather recommmend another layoutelement to reach my goal p  pIve never done any design aspect in Android before, so Im quite lost in this field. Do you guys know any good tutorials or books for designing android applications. p

Negative 1609 pId like to create a Swift framework that others can import into their project and use, but I dont want to distribute the source code.

Negative 1609 pI am now trying to modulize my javascript code using RequireJS. I have 2 JS files lets say A and B. A is a big file that has main code for my html page. B is a small utility library which is designed to be used by A and any other code in the future.p  pMy plan is to firstly modulize B since B is small. After this I can write all my new code using RequireJS in the future and use B. On the other hand I will gradually modulize A. My concern now is that after I modulize B, is there a way that file A can continue use code in B so that my app can work correctlyp  pI cannot find out anything about this. Any suggestions, articles or sample code are welcome.p

Negative 1609 pNote the following mentions a hrefhttpswww.gnu.orgsoftwaregnulibmanualhtmlnodeexecinfo002eh.html relnofollowexecinfoa   a hrefhttpwww.gnu.orgsoftwarelibcmanualhtmlnodeBacktraces.html relnofollowcodebacktracecodea, but this is only an example. The behavior in the question appeared with various libraries.p  hr  pConsider a utility library that tracks the resource allocations of some application linked with it. As functions allocate and deallocate resources, they call a tracking function that records the details of the operation, as well as some information which can be used to reconstruct the call path. Occasionally, the library is queried for a breakdown of operations by call paths.p  pIn the settings of this question, tracking is required to be low overhead, but querying not necessarily. Consequently, for tracking I stored the minimal information identifying the call path, e.g., by calling a hrefhttpswww.gnu.orgsoftwaregnulibmanualhtmlnodeexecinfo002eh.html relnofollowexecinfoa  a hrefhttpwww.gnu.orgsoftwarelibcmanualhtmlnodeBacktraces.html relnofollowcodebacktracecodea. Translating the symbols, unmangling, and so forth, are deferred to queries, and are not part of this question. p  pTo my surprise, simply calling codebacktracecode slowed down execution by 4000 relative to the a hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferencecstdlibmalloc relnofollowcodemalloccodea call. Since codebacktracecode takes the requested maximal stack depth as an argument, and it can be called by call paths with different stack depths, I tried to see how these parameters affect its performance. As far as I can see, simply calling this function in any way has a huge penalty.p  pFor the measurements I wrote the following simple code see also the a hrefhttpideone.comtT3LQa relnofollowfull versionap  precodeconst sizet maxbacktracesize  100 void backtracebuf[maxbacktracesize]    static void track      ifbacktracesize gt 0         backtracebacktracebuf, backtracesize   static void opsizet i      ifi  0              track         return          opi  1  codepre  pThe first of these two functions, codetrackcode, simulates the actual tracking note that codebacktracesize  0code completely disables the call to codebacktracecode the second one, codeopcode is a recursion that terminates by calling codetrackcode. Using these two functions, I varied the parameters and measured the results see also a hrefhttpnbviewer.ipython.orggistanonymous6a91106b4c3a25b6ee7a relnofollowthe IPython Notebooka.p  pThe following figure shows the tracking time, as a function of different stack sizes, for each of calling codebacktracecode with codebacktracesize  1code or not calling it which has such low time that it lies on the X axis, and can hardly be seen in the figure. codebacktracecode has a huge overhead even if called with small parameters.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1L6J5.png alttime as function of stack depthp  pThe following figure further shows the overhead, now as a function of both the backtrace size and stack depth. Again, there is a huge jump simply calling this function.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcqUbj.png alttime as a function of stack depth and backtrace sizep  ol lipIs there any technical way to reduce the overhead of finding the backtrace perhaps a different library, or different build settings.pli lipIn the absence of 1., is there a completely different viable alternative to the problem at the toppli ol

Negative 1609 pMy question is not deeply technical but more of a system architectural one. p  pIm designing an API backend in Go Lang. Id like to have several clients, like a web server, cell phones etc.. I imagine that all these clients should have a secret API key so to validate that they can use the API. At the same time the web frontend is going to have a lot of users with different restrictions. Id like for these users to be able to log in with their facebook or Google account. That should require OAuth authentication as I understand. My question is now where should I add the OAuth. Only in the frontend and then save the user in session or also between the frontend and the backend. Im highly confused about how I should set up this communication and authentication.p  pIm building the web  server in PHP and Id like the web frontend to be really light weight and more or less only function as en empty shellview for the Go API. Ive build systems in plain PHPMySQL before but Id like to make a shift to Go based APIs.  p  pHow would a URI look like to the API from the web server frontend for lets say a show profile page I imagine something like a GET call to http.backend.com3000[apikey][apisecret][oauthtoken]profile. Then some middleware to authenticate the web client and another piece of middleware to authenticate the user. Would that be the right approach p  pI hope you guys can point me in the right direction. p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1609 pI have a layout that Im working on that requires the sidebar to become fixed after a certain distance has been scrolled.p  pThis works fine except when the user scrolls to the very bottom of the page and my sites footer starts overlapping the sidebar. p  pWhat I want to be able to do is, once a user has scrolled down the page and reached the top of the footer Determined using jQuery code.offsetcode the sidebar will take on CSS codetransformtranslateYXXcode values where the codeXXcode represents the distance the user has scrolled since reaching the top of the footer.p  pSo for example, my footer is 190px in height, so if a user has scrolled to the very foot of the page, my sidebar will have a CSS property of codetransformtranslateY190pxcode.

Negative 1609 pId like to reformat PDF main content, so I need to extract its main content, not just text, but also tables, diagrams, etc. with their layout information. Im only interested in the main part of the content, for example, for technical paper, Im only interested in the columns of text, tables, and diagrams. The headers, footers, and text on the margin can be ignored. p  pIt would be like to scan content stream from PDF pages, recognize them whether they are text paragraph or other.  If they are text paragraph, I may apply certain format treatment to it.  If they are other like table, or diagrams, or anything not like a paragraph, Ill just keep them as is, or just shrink or enlarge to fit in the new display. p  pFor example, the following stream, Id collect the text, and make note of the starting point of the text relative to the pagep  precodestream BT F1 20 Tf 120 120 Td Hello from Steve Tj ET endstream codepre  pContinue to decompose the stream content to organize in an array of document elements with relative position information, whether they are paragraph to be able to reformat the associated text.p  pI guess even just decompose a stream and tell whether they are paragraph of text and note down its relative position may not be trivial. p  pI found that pdf.jss page.render might have the opportunity to help me to achieve the goal, but I havent figured out how it could be adapted. p  pAlso pdf2htmlEx might have similar mechanism to do so, as it can convert PDF file to html. p  pBut not sure at what level the above tools do the renderingconversion, if they directly do them as image, then they may not help to my purpose. p  pAdobes PDF viewer on Android provides function of reflow of PDF content on mobile phones small screen. it may use some mechanism of full content capture, and transformation that Id like to have. p  pSo my question is for pointers how my requirements could be achievedp  pThanks a lotp

Negative 1609 pIm working on a deploy that, at first, clones the previous release and then secondly, updates the release from the remote repo. This gets tricky when there are submodules involved. The main repo is handled like thisp  precodegit clone pathtolocal.git pathtonewrelease git remote seturl origin ltmy remote repogt codepre  pThat way subsequent calls to git pull will use the remote repo. What Id like to do is the same thing for the submodules within the repo. In pseudocodep  precodegit submodule foreach git clone each submodule from local repo git submodule foreach git pull from remote repo codepre  pIve read quite about this and cant seem to wrap my head around it. Thanks in advance for any help.p
Negative 1609 pstrongEDIT SKIP TO BELOWstrongp  pI am trying to make a reddit app for android, the only problem I am running into is the comments section now.  I get the JSON file from reddit and then turn it into a GSON object and the problem you start to run into is with the replies.  So a comment can have replies, which is a list of more comments and those comments can have replies and so on.  When trying to display this in android it becomes confusing.  So what I have done is made a xml object that has a listview inside of it as well as the the textviews for author and the comment itself above this listview.  Now in my custom adapter it can tell if the replies has a list of objects and update that listview otherwise it hides the listview.  I know you are not supposed to put a listview inside anysort of scrollable view but how else am I supposed to handle this.  It almost works the way I am doing it but the problem is the listviews are scrollable inside each other sometimes and so what I am asking is how to make the inner Listviews wrap content or atleast act like they do.p  pstrongNEW PROBLEMstrongp  pAfter Doing some research I am seeing that the only way I can make my app work the way I want to is to ditch the listviews and move onto LinearLayouts.

Negative 1609 pIm planning on creating a C windows form application that will use a local database for only one user.I dont know what software the client has installed on his computer but I want my application to work.It should have .NET installed ofc.

I did have success with MS Access database but I heard here that this solution is depricated.p
Negative 1609 pSo a very common feature in many applications is searching for usernames in the database. Common suggestions are using a LIKE with searchname, however the problem with this method is that it will return the results in no particular order, not placing more relevant results above less relevant ones.p  pFor example, if my table contains Bob, Hobobo, Tabob and Bobert, the search for bob will return all of them, but it will potentially put Tabob and Hobobo at the top of the results.p  pI was thinking something along the lines of doing a LIKE searchname, and concatenating it with the LIKE searchname table and then applying UNIQUE to it, but I was wondering if anyone had a more powerful, less search intensiveideally 1 query solution for properly organizing the results with more relevant ones on top.p  pThis seems like a simple enough issue, but I havent actually seen a nice clean solution for it.p

Negative 1609 pId like to visualize a number of points on a map. Unfortunately, there is no consistent address associated with each one. Ive used Google Fusion tables to get a rough read on where the points are, and am relatively satisfied with the approximate locations of most points sometimes Google figures out where theyre located based on a landmark, sometimes based on an intersection provided, sometimes by street address, etc..p  pMy goal, then, is to create a choropleth map of a city NYC, in this case, showing the number of points located in each neighbourhood. Is it possible to do this by somehow counting the number of points that fall within each neighbourhoodp  pI suspect that if fusion tables give me a passable visual, I may be able to use googles geocoding service in the same manner to figure out the number of points in each area, and use this to then build a choropleth not a heat map  Im after some level of interaction, like tooltips over each neighbourhood.p  pIs there any way to do this, or am I way, way offp

Negative 1609 pWe have a backend C Solution which provides web services. And a frontend website which accesses the backend.p  pBoth of them should be deployed automatically on one server for testing.p  pDeploying the backend is no problem  I can use the TFS Build for building the projects and deploy them to the server.p  pBut how can I deploy the frontend website It is not integrated in any Solution or Project in Visual Studio. Because it is just simple HTML, JavaScript etc. and doesnt contain any ASP code or something. The only place, where I can find the website files, is at the Build Server in the local src folder.p  pSo the only options I see is one of the following 1. Access the src folder on the Build Server via BatchFile. Or 2. Create a new project that contains all the website Filesp  pBoth of them do not look as a proper solution. The first one because I think its bad practice to pick my own files out from the buildserver. The second because I would have to add every file manually to this project.p  pAny better ideas or experiencep
Negative 1609 pMaybe I just dont know where to look or dont exactly understand how threads work, but I have two different JFrames J1, J2. J1 is the main JFrame that has a drop down menu that will select J2. When this J2 becomes visible I need J1 to wait until J2s foobar value to become something other than 1.

The value will be assigned when the user clicks submit. It isnt doing the job. What am I doing wrong here and more importantly, if this is a thread thing, where is my concept of threads failingp

It is really annoying, so I can either mute text the GroupMe server and stop getting messages or mute my phone vibrations altogether. The problem with these solutions is that I dont want to completely mute the messages from the server altogether. I want to be able to read them when I decide to. I also dont want to mute my phone altogether because then I cant tell if someone else tried to text me.p  pI tried searching online for help on the topic and I came across the a hrefhttpsplay.google.comstoreappsdetailsidac.vibrationamphlen relnofollowContact Vibratea application. It had a bunch of features and seemed pretty messy in organization. You could set custom vibrate patterns for each of your contacts. I noticed that it had plenty of default vibrate patterns, but none that just vibrated once and none that vibrated zero times. I tried to create one that didnt vibrate, but that didnt work. I ended up deleting the app altogether.p  pI still havent found a way to silence the vibrate messages for that specific contact while allowing the messages themselves to be received. Solutionp

Negative 1609 pI am relatively new to database programming. I use firebird 2.5 with IBPP. I have at least two applications using the sampe firebird database. I want to connect with the embedded variant fbembedded.dll, icudt30.dll, icuc30.dll, since it will be a host application on customer PCs. I wrote a simple test application reading data from the database and started this application three times at the same time. Everything worked.p  pBut now I am not shure if this works always and if this works stable without the danger to corrupt data. Because when I have a connection with the database with the viewer ibexpert my test application cannot connect to the database. Additionally, the documantation sais a hrefhttpwww.firebirdsql.orgmanualufbcsembedded.html relnofollowfirebirdEmbeddedap  blockquote   pYou can have multiple embedded servers running at the same time, and   you can have multiple apps connecting to the same embedded server.   Having a regular server already running isnt a problem either.   strongHowever, an embedded server locks a database file for its own   exclusive use after successful connection. This means that you cannot   access the same database from multiple embedded server processes   simultaneously or from any other servers, once an embedded server has   locked the file.strongp blockquote  pIs the documantation right My sample application seems to show the opposite. I had a firebird superserver installed on my pc a while ago but uninstalled it before testing this.p
