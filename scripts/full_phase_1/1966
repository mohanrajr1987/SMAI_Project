Positive 1966 pWhile I was watching some dramas, I stumbled upon viki.com. Vikis videos have a comment system inside the video.

Can I make an HTML element containing my comment system and place it inside the video tag with the appropriate CSS and Javascript Would that allow me to do thisp  pHow would I go about it Im open to any suggestions.

Negative 1966 pMy application is using workflow designer rehosting to let endusers develop workflows. I have an Activity available that requires the user set some state. To accomplish this, in the designer I override InitializeActivity and show a form which I then use to set values in my Activity. This is for setting the state when the Activity is initially added. I also have a double click event handler in the designer in case they need to edit that state later.p  pI now have a situation where, depending on the values in the form, I may need to add or remove a child activity. Ive been successful in adding the activity, but not always in getting it to show up in the designer.p  pWhen Initialize is called, there are no child activities. I may need to add a child Activity. At this point, it works fine and shows up in the designer. The problem happens when they edit it later by double clicking. In my designer, I override OnActivityChanged to detect this. I make the same call to add a child, however the designer is not getting updated. Oddly enough, when the situation is such that the child is removed, the view updates fine.p  pStepping through with the debugger shows that I am adding a child activity to the Activities collection. Normally when I have problems updating the view, I can make a call to IComponentChangeService.OnComponentChanged, but I cant seem to find a way to make this work.p  pAny suggestions p  pIt looks like I needed to use RemoveActivities and InsertActivities in the designer. It seems as if the designer doesnt listen to list change events on the Activities list. Does anyone know if this is how its supposed to workp
Negative 1966 pI did some looking around at how other sites might handle this and didnt really see anything that jumped out at me. Im working on a project where you can create pages that get linked to from every other page. Here is where the issue is coming up for me.p  pIm not sure how I should go about linking to these pages. Ive only really thought of two ideas, them beingp  ol licodewebsite.compageMyPageNamecodeli licodewebsite.comMyPageNamecodeli ol  pTo note, Im using modrewrite to redirect them to a file that takes the page name as a parameter and grabs all the relevant info from the DB and displays it. This is where an issue develops for idea 2.p  pstrongIdea 1strong works and is solid, but I think its kind of ugly and you dont see a lot of websites that link to other pages of the site with other information padded in the URL.p  pstrongEDITstrong for a bit of clarity. The intention of said pages are to be static in the sense they will only ever display what the user sets them to display. They will never except any sort of data in which case pages formatted like in this example would be more appropriate. Id compare these page more so towards SOs faqs or about page which dont have URLs formatted in this manner.p  pstrongIdea 2strong looks cleaner but runs into some issues when using modrewrite and creating said pages.p  pThere are other parts of the site that are linked to that could be mimicked and cause conflicts if you named the page the same. For example, codewebsite.compage1code points to page1 which already exists, but a conflict would arise if someone wanted to create a page called page1.p  pSo implementing this idea Id have to filter and limit the user in what page names they could use and at the same time this could make the feature a bit unintuitive and leave them scratching their head. As well as it seems a bit ugly coding it, having an array of unacceptable page names and having to check against it.p  pThe last bit dealing with modrewrite to redirect to something like that codeRewriteRule [AZaz09] getPage.phpp1code gets a bit ugly as it gets a bit greedy even while limiting what itll except.p  pSo does anyone have any insight on any other possible methods to tackle this issue with or how the implementation of one of the two mentioned could be different  betterp  pThanks.p

Negative 1966 pA question of ColdFusion ORMp  pWe are using ColdFusion 9 for the past 6 months and while weve used some of the new features, ORM is something weve avoided because we usually work on the same very large website. Over the years weve used Apache OBJ but then we moved back to CF and used our own DAO objects generated from tables to handle basic CRUD. These objects are basic and need to be regenerated manually for schema changes and do not model table relationships at all. To supplement these we have a set of gateway classes for multitable queries. While all this is very bespoke, these DAOs and gateways do, however, give us great control over the SQL we execute, for example using locking hints and optimiser hints. Our site is busy but our database is very efficient.p  pSo much for the history lesson the point of this is that we have a new site upcoming soon that will be written from scratch to handle financial transactions. We would normally use our aforementioned DAO objects to handle CRUD and then the usual set of gateway objects for multitable joins but I thought we might investigate using bakedin CF ORM...p  pSo with that in mind, Id love to hear of the lessons, tips and tricks others might have to share in regard to using ORM on a busy financial site. For examplep  pWhats the best way to flush your SQL  What tips do you have for transactional ORM How do you setup development and live sites for ORM What about HQL When should we just do the SQL ourselves by handp  pThanks in advancep

Its like an static attribute but codeenumcode has no lazy initialization.

Unfortunately, it means we have to inject the codeApplicationContextcode into the codeenumcode somehow. So we need a global variable for that. emcringeemp  pWhats worse Looking up the value in codegetBarcode is way too slow. We can codesynchronizecode codegetBarcode and use codeifbar nullbarcontext.getname.barcode to solve this.p  pBut is there a way without this that is as safe and fast as using the codeenumcode values themselvesp

On a scale of 1 to 5, users are asked to rate how well they like each piece of art, and then are shown the next photo.  Eventually, the app is able to get an sense of the persons style and is able to recommend artwork that heshe may find pleasing.p  pThe whole concept is similar to Netflix.  I understand how to do all the preference matching logic although not as sophisticated as Netflix.  emButem Id like to find a way to do this without requiring that users create an account first.  This is a novelty website that a typical user might use only a handful of times.  Requiring registration is overkill and will likely drastically reduce its utility.  Id like to allow people to begin rating artwork within five seconds of their initial pageview, yet maintain the integrity of the voting since recommendations are predicated on how other people have rated the various pieces of artwork.  p  pCan it be donep  pSome ideasp  ul listrongOpenIDstrong.

Negative 1966 pTake the following scenario. I have multiple ASPX pages. Login, Logout, Main, Messages, etc... They all inherit from System.Web.UI.Page of course.

I could easily copy and paste the same code into each page like sop  precodeprotected override void RenderHtmlTextWriter writer       Code Logic Here  codepre  pBut if I had many pages, lets say 20, maintaining the code in each page could get very time consuming and error prone.p  pThat made me think a bit and I thought okay lets try this...override the function in each page but call a static function. That way changing the static function would result in a change for every page.  Which works fine... But its not really nice and clean, having to override like that on every single page.  Anybody have any ideas or thoughts on this one  Perhaps something simple I am overlooking  Thanksp  pEDIT Some pages use the System.Web.UI.Page class and some pages inherit from another class called ModifiedPage which inherits and overridies other functions of the System.Web.UI.Page class. So its not as simple as inheriting all the pages from one class.p  pEDIT2 All pages need this behavior, some already derive from another class, and I am unable to change the implementation or inheritance hierarchy of that other class.p

Negative 1966 pmy name is Timothy Sassone.  I am working on developing some scheduling software of a sort in C, but have run into some trouble.  This last part of the program is intended to take a large list of weekly events stored as days of the week and a start and end time, and sort them into sublists containing events that overlap with oneanother such that no one could possibly have attended two of the events in the sublist.p  pAt the moment, it does this by finding the longest event in the list endTimestartTimenumDays, and adding it and every course it overlaps with to a sublist.  It then finds all the conflicts events which do not overlap and resolves them while removing the fewest number of courses possible.  This much I have, but with the number of ranges I have to deal with, I end up with a rather high number of sublists.  Is there any better way to split the list, such that I end up with fewer sublistsp  pI have considered a bruteforce method, simply trying every possibility and going with the best, but the number of ranges is high enough anywhere from 100500 on average that doing so could be rather slow.  Any suggestions or pointers would be most appreciated.p  pThank you for your time,p  pTimothy Sassonep

Negative 1966 pIve set up a codeTabHostcode containing a codeTabWigetcode with three tabs in it  each of which loads a separate activity.

Negative 1966 pA friend of mine and I recently were having a debate about this, so I was wondering if anyone here might actually know the answer.p  pGenerally, to emulate the codeLIMIT startindex,resultcountcode syntax of MySQL and the codeLIMIT resultcount OFFSET startindexcode functionality of MySQL and PostgreSQL in Oracle, we usep  precodeSELECT P. FROM    SELECT COL1...COLN, ROWNUMBER OVER IDCOLUMN AS RN FROM MYTABLE  WHERE P.RN BETWEEN STARTINDEX AND ENDINDEX codepre  pInstead of an explicit limit function, this alternate means needs to be used. If there is a better way, please let me knowp  pOne of us argued that this means that Oracle actually fetches ENDINDEX records and then only returns those records which have a rn over STARTINDEX. This means that when looking for records 123,432123,442 Oracle would retrieve 123,431 unnecessary records. It was then argued that it followed that the two open source DBs mentioned MySQL amp PgSQL by implication have a means of shortcutting this.p  pThe counter argument is that DBMSs are optimized to handle subqueries, meaning that the syntax does not necessarily imply the behavior. Further, the LIMIT syntaxes are likely merely syntactic sugar which are really wrappers around what has to be stated explicitly in Oracle.p  pIs there any who can determine which of these is the correct interpretation Perhaps both are correct in some wayp

Negative 1966 pI have an application that requires the creation and download of a significantly large SQLite database.  Depending on the users data, creation of the db and the syncing of data from the server can take upwards of 20 to 25 minutes some customers have a LOT of data.   The data is downloaded as JSON and processed with Androids built in JSON classes.p  pTo account for OutOfMemory issues I was having with some devices, I needed to limit the percall download from the server to 500 records at a time.  But, as of now, all of the above is working successfully  although slow.p  pRecently, there has been talk from my team of creating the complete SQLite db on the server side and then just downloading it to the device in binary in an effort to speed things up.   Ive never done this before.  Is this indeed a viable option OR should I just be looking into speeding up the processing of the JSON through a 3rd party lib like GSON or Jackson.p  pThanks in advance for your input.p

Granted the thread pool and all accompanying code was written to run using older versions of Spring 1.2.6 and old ojdbc driver, but is there really that big of difference in the way OracleConnectionCacheImpl works versus Universal Connection Pooling  Am I looking at rewriting my domain model if I want to accommodate the latest versions of Oracles JDBC driver code.  I have tried OracleDataSource connection and it failed miserably with NullPointerExceptions after working on several files concurrently. I then went to UCP at the suggestion of another post in this forum which works fine in all but one application.  At this point Im trying to figure out whether I can further optimize the Spring config bean for my datasource or do I need to start thinking about upgrading the code base.  As stated previously, this code runs very well against the old ojdbc class, but I have had issues every step of the way trying to implement UCP.  Im startg to wonder if its even worth upgrading.p

Negative 1966 pPlease refer to my question asked at tektips.com a hrefhttptektips.comviewthread.cfmqid1663735amppage1 relnofollowhttptektips.comviewthread.cfmqid1663735amppage1ap  pAs I mentioned in a couple of my other threads, Im building a control to pretty much replicate the SMS text messaging on the iPhone. This consists of simply a bubble on either side of the control containing text. I already have a working version, but need to rebuild it from scratch. Id like some advice on some things...p  pWhat do you think is the best method to store the list of message data I was thinking using a TCollection, but that could be way too heavy. Currently Im using a TStringList containing raw text data which is parsed out and translated appropriately. This works great because I dont have to create any extra objects with loads of unnecessary properties. Its just...p  precodedata syntax ltusersizegtltdeliminatorgtltusergtltmessagesizegtltdeliminatorgtltmessagegt  which could look like 9djjd4713023This is a test message  characters SDTTTTTTTTTSSDTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT  usersize  9 deliminator   user  djjd47130 etc....... codepre  pAnyway, I expect possibly thousands of messages in this control. Which brings me to my next question. The best way to draw it. Currently, Im using a TDrawGrid, and am in the process of converting it to a TStringGrid so I can contain the text directly in the grid rather than the TStringList. However thats where I stopped because Im wondering if theres another better way than to use a grid. Its easy because it automatically manages storing the rect of each cell, etc.p  pHow about using a TImage instead Theres another concern about the largest possible control size. This control automatically grows higher with the more messages, so again, if theres for example 1,000 messages, with an average message bubble height of about 80 pixels, that would mean the grid control needs to be 80,000 pixels high. Using a TImage though could be tough, because I would then have to manually calculate the position on that canvas to draw each balloon, similar to how grids internally keep track of that.p  pBy the way, this grid or otherwise canvas is inside of a TScrollBox final control will inherit from a TScrollingWinControl. This is how it can scroll, while the actual canvas its self is much larger than the control, big enough to draw all the message balloons. Scrolling in the control is actually moving up and down in the TScrollBox to see portions of the control canvas displaying the messages.p  pTo summarize the pieces I need to perfect  Lightweight method of storing message items in a list inside grid, string list, collection, or other list  Scrollable canvas with list items of variable height grid, image, or other list  Allowing maximum number of messages to be kept with variable heights  Ability to customize how the control reacts to user actions to automatically scroll up or downp  pIm not necessarily asking for a fix for anything, but rather advice to make it the best possible way.p

Negative 1966 pIm making a static library of my gui api. On OSX it depends on Cocoa framework. The library builds fine but when I try to compile a cpp that uses it, I would expect the cocoa dependency to be taken care of and for the user only to need to link to my library. However, the application fails to compile and the linker has a bunch of errors regarding unresolved external symbol, essentially it is missing cocoa. If I add framework cocoa to the g command line, the app builds fine. I want to avoid having to write that for each application I compile with it. What could I be doing wrong when compiling Im using CMAKE and telling it to link to cocoa.p  pIs there something I do not understand about how static libraries work I have another library that uses cocoa and when I use it I do not need to supply framework Cocoa.p  pThanksp

Negative 1966 pIm writing a game that uses WPF for its interface, and Direct3D11 for rendering the world. The rendering happens on its own thread but it needs to make use of a D3DImage in the window, so I need to use a SynchronizationContext to switch to the UI thread when rendering. When the game first starts up I make a DispatcherSynchronizationContext from the Application.Current.Dispatcher. Some time after this happens, a window is created and then is stored in Application.Current.MainWindow. When its time to render I have to switch to the context like sop  precodeasync      ...     do Async.SwitchToContext state.Context     render stuff   codepre  pEverything is fine up until the main window closes. Once that happens my handler for Application.Exit runs, which tells all subsystems to shut down and then waits for their responses. The problem is the render thread hangs either on the next Async.SwitchToContext, or if the switch already happened just before the window closed then it hangs sometime during the actual rendering, so it can never respond to the shutdown request.p  pThe DispatcherSynchronizationContext doesnt become null, and both the value of DSCs HasShutdownStarted and HasShutdownFinished are false. Im not getting any exception either. The application is still running, it wont exit until it gets a response from all the subsystems.p  pWhat is happening at this point in the program The application is still running, so its dispatcher should still be there, so I should still be able to switch to its context. There is no change in the SynchronizationContext before and after the window closes that would lead me to believe its no longer valid, so I have no idea how to check if its safe to switch or not. p

Negative 1966 pIm running into a problem with the WPF TreeView control. I think I ran into a memory leak issue with this control and also some performance issues. Ive prepared a simple demo solution where you can see these problems. Download link a hrefhttpwww.customprojects.comTreeViewMemoryAndPerformanceIssue.zip relnofollowhttpwww.customprojects.comTreeViewMemoryAndPerformanceIssue.zipap  pIm creating the tree based on some domain objects. The objects are wrapped in view models. The number of levels is not restricted, but currently we have a maximum of 3 levels.p  pSo, each view model can have children.p  pWhen you click on the updown buttons of the UpDown control and dont release the mouse button you will see, that the update speed of the int value will get slower and slower and the memory consumption constantly rises.p  pWhat Im doing When you click on the updown button the value is sent to the view model via data binding. In the setter Im raising a event. Our application consists of different view models and if someone is changing data in one of them, the others are notified through these DataChanged events.p  pFor simplicity, my demo solutions just consists of the NavigationViewModel. So it listens for the DataChanged event and if fired, the tree is rendered.p  pBecause we dont have a list which will always be the same and just rows are added or removed, Im not using a ObservableCollection. We always have to regenerate the list based on the objects the user has addedcreated.p  pAnyways, Im adding these view models to a list and raise the NotifyPropertyChanged event so that WPF updates the tree. Works well but the more the list is updated, the slower the application gets and memory goes up.p  pI checked, that the item view models are garbage collected and they are, so I dont see something wrong on my side. I also did some performance profiling. It looks, that the issue is on the WPF side, because my code does not slow down. The Application.Run method execution time rises... Strange thing.p  pDoes anyone has an idea, why the memory is going up and never gets released and why the performance starts to decrease the more often the TreeView updates itselfp  pI would appreciate any help or comment on this issue.p  pThanks, Christianp

Negative 1966 pHeres the issue. I have an application where I want to press a button, start a new activity that displays a list of items, allow the user to select any number of items, click submit and send that data to the original activity that called the new activity with the list of items. Heres the basic structurep  precodeActivity A gt Activity B select items, press submit gt [already running] Activity A receive sent items codepre  pI have no problem sending data back and forth. The problem that I do have is that when I try to restart Activity A, it goes through the Activitys codeonCreatecode method. I prefer not to do this because I want to be able to set up everything beforehand in the codeonCreatecode method, then supplement what is already in there through the codeonRestartcode method. Im not exactly sure why the codeonCreatecode method is being called every time I restart the activity. My guess is the way I call the activity in Activity Bp  precodeIntent intent  new Intentthis, PatientChartActivity.class intent.putExtrachecked, checked intent.putStringArrayListExtrachecked, checked startActivityintent codepre  pI have been looking at the Android activity lifecycle and Im not sure why it is not automatically returning to the previous activity, unless I do indeed have to force it do do so. One thing that I am sure of is the the activity that is running is not being destroyed. I put in a codeLog.vTAG, DESTROYcode log message in the codeonDestroycode method ensuring it doesnt destroy the activity. I have tried using different flags when I start the activity to tell the system that I want to restore a previously started activity, but those dont seem to work either. I may misunderstand them. I have researched exstensiveley on the topic but none of the solutions I found have helped. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7293820howtoopenalreadyopenedactivityinsteadofcreatingnewoneHerea is an issue that I found that seems to be identical to mine but didnt seem to solve what I was looking for.

Negative 1966 pCan strongSimpleMembershipstrong be used with strongEF modelfirststrong  When I try it, I get Unable to find the requested .NET Framework Data Provider when I call codeWebSecurity.InitializeDatabaseConnection.codep  pTo put it another way I cant get the call to codeWebSecurity.InitializeDatabaseConnectioncode to work when the connection string employs the codeSystem.Data.EntityClientcode provider as it does when using the strongmodelfirststrong paradigm.p  pTo repro the issue, create an MVC 4 app, and replace the strongcodefirststrong UserProfile entity class which you get for free with the MVC 4 template with a strongmodelfirststrong User class that you have created in the Entity Designerp  ol liCreate an MVC 4 app in strongVS 2012strong and add a new, blank Entity Data Model.li liAdd a new Entity named codeUsercode to the model, with fields for codeId,code codeUserName, and FullNamecode.  So, at this point, the codeUsercode data entity is mapped to a codeUserscode table and is accessed via a funky connection string that employs the codeSystem.Data.EntityClientcode provider.li liVerify that the strongEFstrong can access the codeUsercode entity.  One easy way to do that is to scaffold out a Users controller based on the User table and its associated DbContext.li liEdit the codeAccountModels.cscode file to remove the codeUserProfilecode class and its associated codeUsersContextcode class. Replace the references to the now missing codeUserProfilecode and codeUsersContextcode classes with references to your new User class and its associated codeDbContextcode class.li liMove the call to InitializeDatabaseConnection from the InitializeSimpleMembershipAttribute filter class to the ApplicationStart method in Global.asax.cs.  While youre at it, modify the arguments to use your new User entitys connection string, table name, and UserId column name.li liDelete the no longer used codeInitializeSimpleMembershipAttributecode class and the references to it.li ol  pWhen you run the repro, it will get an strongExceptionstrong at the call to codeInitializeDatabaseConnection.codep  pBobp

Negative 1966 pMy apologies if this is the wrong site for this problem, as it is more mathrelated than programming.I am trying to write a series of 7 page links, in a Googleesque fashion.

Negative 1966 pWere working on an embedded software UI framework based on Qt which would currently power 2 types of devices   a phone and a tablet. Later on there might be other form factors which will have completely different UIs. The UI currently is similar for both the phone and the tablet with differences mostly being in dimensions. We would like to expose a common API to application developers internal, no external apps so that they dont have to write separate screens for each platform.p  pTo develop a screen, the app developer has to inherit from a Screen class, or from a more specialized screen such as PrefScreen class. We wanted to expose a uniform interface for each component to app developers, but with platform specific implementations in the framework. We have the following classesp  pScreenBase Exposes interfaces common to all platforms ScreenPhone  ScreenBase ScreenTablet  ScreenBasep  pPrefScreenBase Exposes interfaces common to all platforms br  PrefScreenPhone PrefScreenBase PrefScreenTablet PrefScreenBasep  pTo achieve it we have the following type defsp  precodeifdef PHONE typedef ScreenPhone Screen typedef PrefScreenPhone PrefScreen elif TABLET typedef ScreenTablet Screen typedef PrefScreenTablet PrefScreen endif codepre  pThe inheritance structure is as follows ScreenBase br  ScreenPhone br  ScreenTablet br p  pPrefScreenBase  Screen resolves to ScreenPhone or ScreenTablet based on the platform its built for br  PrefScreenPhone br  PrefScreenTablet br p  pScreen would resolve to ScreenPhone on the build for the phone, and resolve to ScreenTablet on the build for the tablet. PrefScreen would resolve to PrefScreenPhone on the build for the phone, and resolve to PrefScreenTablet on the build for the tablet.p  pOn the phone, the hierarchy would be ScreenBaseScreenPhonePrefScreenBasePrefScreenPhone On the tablet, the hierarchy would be ScreenBaseScreenTabletPrefScreenBasePrefScreenTabletp  pIn essence, the platform specific classes derive from the common Base classes, and the Base classes derive from the appropriate class based on the platform it is built for. We considered using the Bridge Pattern httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBridgepattern to solve the problem but our deadlines dont seem to allow that. Also since our framework is based on the Qt framework,  separating the implementation from the interfaces would be complicated.p  pIs the above mentioned approach being used in any frameworks Do you see major problems with the mentioned approach If so, what would be the alternative Our main goals are to abstract away the platform differences to application developers, and to ensure maximum code reuse.p

Negative 1966 pI want update a column in mysql with a loop. I have two arrays that are pulled from another database every 4 hours. The first has a station number that is in my db as an index.

Negative 1966 pI am using Ember Data revision 8 and calling the find method on the store with an ID.br If the server does not find a record for this ID then Im not sure how to let my controllers and views know.p  pThe find method in the adapter does not receive an instance of the record so if the server returns an empty hash I can not access the records state manager to transition it into another state. p  pI was looking at the Store and did not see any method I could call directly from my adapter to say Hey I did not find a record with this ID for this Type. Move it [record in the record cache] out of loading into deleted. I guess I could call Store.load... to transition the record but this sounds like a dirty workaround.p  pAt the moment, the records isLoaded computed property will always be false which means that if I implement some kind of spinner based on this property then it will just hang.p  pHas anyone faced this beforep  pThanksp

Negative 1966 pI recently added 7 views to a database.  When I go to may project that contains the data models for that db and use Reverse Engineer Code First in EF 4.3.1 several views are not generated.p  pAt first I thought there was some sort of order issue where a few of the views which depended on other views were somehow out of order and might be impacting the process.  I renamed my views so that in the SQL Server Management Studio they appeared alphabetically in order they are needed.p  pThis did not seem to help.p  pThe 5 views which are generated are indeed the first 5 views that need to be there.  However, the final 2 views are the ones not being generated.p  pAll the views except for the first 3 contain joins on other views so I dont expect joins to be an issue.p  pHowever, it looks as though both the missing views contain aggregates SUM and appropriate GROUP BY functions whereas the first 5 dont.p  pIve done some searches but I dont see anywhere that there is a restriction on aggregate functions in regards to Reverse Engineer Code First.  Is there a workaround to this issuep  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI made a new project and, instead of using my own convoluted existing database, I tried using Adventureworks. When I reverse engineered it the view with aggregates did indeed get modeled properly by EF.p  pWhen I looked at this view Sales.vSalesPersonSalesByFiscalYears I noticed that the all the aggregates were done using pivot. So I then rewrote my views that use aggregates to use pivots instead.  They still do not get imported.p
Negative 1966 pI use NSUserDefaults to save a switch onoff and so far it is good. It remembers the switch position in next session.p  pNow to the thing which I do not understand. I use the same switch with the same namein another view, lets say a flip view which is pushed in from the first view. If I change the switch in the first view it is automatically changed in the flip view. But the other way round, if I change it in the flip view it is not changed in the first view when I go back. Only if I restart the application the first view is also changed.p  pHow can I solve this to be changed at the same time Or kind of refresh the first view without need to restart.p

Negative 1966 pI have went through a myriad of resources including, but not limited to, a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforummsgandroidopencvLIixgriYSscEZWqxp5O3QJ relnofollowOpenCV4Androids Google groupa, StackOverflow and a hrefhttpanswers.opencv.orgquestion2658staticinitializationproblem relnofollowOpenCVs answersa page trying to resolve this, reaching a point where suggestions become redundant. The problem may be more or less similar to a previous yet to be resolved a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14588578opencvusingandroidndkcouldnotberesolvederrorquestiona of mine, but a different situation and thus perhaps a different source of error. p  pI have added an Android Activity to a package containing a successfullyrunning app OpenCVs tutorial 3 sample demonstrating ndk use. The activity uses OpenCVs java API, but there is a call to codeSystem.loadLibrarynativefilecode where codenativefilecode represents a native library. The block where the codeloadLibrarycode is called is mentioned below it is in the codeonManagerConnectedcode method. At the codeloadLibrarycode line, Logcat emitsp  precode0217 192739.239 EAndroidRuntime10872 FATAL EXCEPTION main 0217 192739.239 EAndroidRuntime10872 java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError Library nativefile not found 0217 192739.239 EAndroidRuntime10872    at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibraryRuntime.java461 0217 192739.239 EAndroidRuntime10872    at java.lang.System.loadLibrarySystem.java557 codepre  pSuch error indeed did occur multiple times in other questions and I have tried the suggestions I came across. However, there is a noteworthy observation to this problem the app that successfully runs the OpenCV sample calls the same library through codeSystem.loadLibrarynativefilecode. p  pThe code is rather long and thus not helpful to place in the question. However below summarises what I presume are key elements regarding the problem, it also summarises some of the previous answers related to the matter.p  ul liThe .cpp file called has the correct method name, where I verify that it includes the package name and the class name, as well as the method name, in a pattern similar to codeJavapackageNameSeperatedWithUnderScorescallingClassNamemethodNamecode. Morever the code is surrounded within an codeextern Ccode block, as with other OpenCV sample cpp files for native development.li liThe Android manifest is updated to learn that it launches the activity in question.li lipBelow is the codeAndroid.mkcode filep  pcodeLOCALPATH  call mydir include CLEARVARSbr include ....sdknativejniOpenCV.mk LOCALMODULE     nativefilebr LOCALSRCFILES  nativefile.cppbr LOCALLDLIBS   llog ldlbr include BUILDSHAREDLIBRARYcodepli lipBelow is the codeApplication.mkcode filep  pcodeAPPSTL  gnustlstaticbr APPCPPFLAGS  frtti fexceptionsbr APPABI  allcode  pli lipI have tried replacing codeallcode in the codeAPPABIcode line with codearmeabicode and also again tried with codearmeabiv7acode, no different results however. pli liIve also verified, as suggested in a comment a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13385265ndklibrarynotfoundherea, that the apk after being extracted contains the needed code.socode file in codelibcode folder under the various architecture type folders.li lipBelow is the codeBaseLoaderCallBackcode instantiation block, not much unlike that in the OpenCV sample, however I do not call the OpenCV camera, since the app performs image processing on images read from the SD card.p  precode BaseLoaderCallback loader  new BaseLoaderCallbackthis  public void onManagerConnectedint status       switchstatus              case LoaderCallbackInterface.SUCCESS               System.loadLibrarynativefile break            default                super.onManagerConnectedstatus break           codepreli lipUnlike OpenCVs sample however, in the Activity in question the line codeloader.onManagerConnectedLoaderCallbackInterface.SUCCESScode is added to the codeonCreatecode method, since the method codeonManagerConnectedcode didnt seem to be called otherwise. pli liBefore every OpenCV block of statements, the condition codeif OpenCVLoader.initDebugcode is checked. Ive also tried the a hrefhttpdocs.opencv.orgtrunkandroidservicedocJavaHelper.html relnofollowrecommendeda  codeOpenCVLoader.initAsyncOpenCVLoader.OPENCVVERSION243, this, loadercode conditional check, but still no different results.li liAlso, the ndkbuild runs successfully building the code.socode files for the native library codenativefilecode.li ul  pGiven that the other activity, within the same package, load the library and utilises it finely of course after amending the manifest file and cpp method name accordingly, I presume the project properties are correct such as adding OpenCV library, and necessary environment paths, etc. p  pI reviewed the OpenCV sample multiple times and followed the same practice with slight variances, as detailed above. p  pAny ideas what could be the source of the problem   p  pThank you for your time.p

Negative 1966 pIm curious to know if there is some way to call a function using an associative array to declare the parameters.p  pFor instance if I have this functionp  precodefunction testhello, world      echo hello . world  codepre  pIs there some way to call it doing something like thisp  precodecalltest, arrayhello gt First value, world gt Second value codepre  pIm familiar with using codecalluserfunccode and codecalluserfuncarraycode, but Im looking for something more generic that I can use to call various methods when I dont know what parameters they are looking for ahead of time.p  pEdit The reason for this is to make a single interface for an API front end. Im accepting JSON and converting that into an array. So, Id like different methods to be called and pass the values from the JSON input into the methods. Since I want to be able to call an assortment of different methods from this interface, I want a way to pass parameters to the functions without knowing what order they need to be in.

Negative 1966 pI been trying to figure this out for hours now. Ive searched for answers, but I cant find an answer. I have never bothered to ask before and this is the first time Im asking a question. Basically what I am doing is breaking up  my coding for organization purposes. The following snippet works just fine, but when I take it and place it into another class the urlConnect connects just fine. Ive marked it below.p  precodepublic String downloadUrlString strUrl throws IOException     String data       InputStream iStream  null     HttpURLConnection urlConnection  null      try         URL url  new URLstrUrl         String line             Creating an http connection to communicate with url          urlConnection  HttpURLConnection url.openConnection           Connecting to url          urlConnection.connect ltworks in this snippet           Reading data from url          iStream  urlConnection.getInputStream         BufferedReader br  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderiStream         StringBuffer sb   new StringBuffer          whileline  br.readLine  null             sb.appendline                  data  sb.toString         br.close          catchException e         Log.dException while downloading url, e.toString          finally          iStream.close         urlConnection.disconnect          return data  codepre  pSo this following snippet, is pretty much identical.

Negative 1966 pI have for quite some time now tried to find a good way to serialize or send a state object over tcp socket. My problem is that I am not able to use any 3. party libraries like boost.p  pMy state object contains multiple objects. The most essential is that it got some objects and a vector of objects, but no pointers eg. probably no deep copying, if vector dont require this.p  pTo my question Since I cant use boost or any other libraries, what is the best way to send a object with objects over socket I have been thinking that I probably could make a copy constructor and send this to a stream, but I am not quite sure about the consequences of doing this.p

Application Folders inherit all Web.config settings from their parent sites, yet expect to have their own copies of all the dlls referenced by those settings in their own bin folder. You can resolve this problem by a changing the app folder to a virtual folder, b adding a copy of ImageResizer.dll and plugins into the bin folder inside that application also, or c using  statements in the child Web.config to cancel out the inherited  statements from the parent Web.config. Option c will disable image resizing within the subapplication.li ol  pYes there is a web.config file in the views directory.

Negative 1966 pIm going to deliver a website for a schoolproject tomorrow and while Im going over bugs I found out that to increase the level of userfriendliness I should change the color of the active page in the header. p  pI know well how i can do this in a basic htmlsite, but now Ive used asp.NET masterpage and after what I understand it would be a bit different this time since I do not have access to the links from other stylesheets than the masterpage.cssp  pSo to simplify the question p  pI got ahover on the links to change color when i hover over them, but want the link of the active page to be in another color to show the user where he is at all times not avisited. p  pHere is my code p  precode    ltnav classnavMaingt             ltulgt                 ltligtlta classahome hrefDefault.aspxgtHjemltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefKampanje.aspxgtOm konkurransenltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefDefault.aspxgtltimg idnavPic srcPicturesheaderMunch150.png altmunch logo gtltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefBildegalleri.aspxgtBidragltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefInfoside.aspxgtOm ossltagtltligt             ltulgt      ltnavgt codepre  pAnd cssp  precode    .navMain  position relative bottom 43px right 80px height 25px width 1000px zindex 100 codepre  pp  precode.navMain navPic      position relative     top 93px     width 120px     height 125px   .navMain a      textdecoration none     color black     fontsize 1.5em       .navMain ahover          color rgb255, 255, 255         .navMain li      liststyle none     display inline     paddingleft 5em   .navMain ul      width 1000px  codepre  pHoping for fast response, thanksp

FB.Event.subscribeauth.authResponseChange, functionresponse       Here we specify what we do with the response anytime this event occurs.      if response.status  connected         The response object is returned with a status field that lets the app know the current        login status of the person.

In reallife usage, you wouldnt want to immediately prompt someone to login         like this, for two reasons        1 JavaScript created popup windows are blocked by most browsers unless they         result from direct user interaction such as a mouse click        2 it is a bad experience to be continually prompted to login upon page load.       FB.login      else         In this case, the person is not logged into Facebook, so we call the login         function to prompt them to do so. Note that at this stage there is no indication        of whether they are logged into the app. If they arent then theyll see the Login        dialog right after they log in to Facebook.

Negative 1966 pHeres a really strange question.  p  pI have a very simple shader with a single uniform vec4, running in a program using GLEW and GLFW.  The program works perfectly fine on several machines with nVidia graphics cards that Ive run the program on.  p  pProblem is, when I switch over to my laptop with an Intel Graphics 3000 chip which supports OpenGL 3.1, the version Im targeting, ANY function call that attempts to set the value of a uniform variable glProgramUniform4f, glProgramUniformMatrix4fv, anything else, the game crashes with an Access Violation.  p  pFurthermore and I know this isnt directly a problem, but I think it may have something to do with the solution, calls to glGetUniformLocation on the nVidia machines return small values, while the same calls on the Intel machine return large   6 digit values.  p  pI would post code, but Im not quite sure exactly what would be helpful.  If a solution doesnt jump out at you, but you have an idea of what sort of code I should post, let me know, and Id be happy to oblige  p  pThank youp

Negative 1966 pI have an html form that has a field that needs to become hidden and replaced with another when a button is clicked.  I cant get rid of this field altogether because its value still must be submitted.  Here is some sample code for referencep  precodeltselect idId.0 onChangechangeTextBoxgt ltinput typebutton idaddButton valueAdd onclickaddQualgt codepre  pBasically what needs to happen is when the addButton is clicked, Id.0 must disappear but remain a member of the form and be replaced by an identical field with idId.1 then upon clicking again idId.2 and so on.p  pIs there a way, using JavaScript or jQuery, to hide and replace this field upon clicking this button Thanksp

Negative 1966 pWhen using VSTO 2012 to manipulate an MS Word Document, I see that the document has a WordOpenXML string property, which is an XML representation of all the files constituting the .docx package which would be saved to disk when saving this Word document as a .docx.p  pI want to convert this string to an equivalent System.IO.Packaging.Package object strongin memorystrong.p  pThe a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7608426howtoconvertthewordopenxmlpropertyintoasystemiopackagingpackageSO question herea is very similar. Indeed, the OP even mentions in memory in his question. However, the answers given involve saving the Package to disk using the codeSystem.IO.Packaging.ZipPackage.Opencode method. I do not want to save the Package to disk and then have to open it again using codeWordprocessingDocument.Opencode method. Rather, I want everything to be done in memory and not involve the file system at all.p  pI see that codeWordprocessingDocument.Opencode has an overload which takes a Stream. However, Im not sure how I would prepare such a Stream from the WordOpenXML string, although I suspect the post referenced above gives much of the answer.p

Negative 1966 pSo I am basically learning SQL injection because I want to be a pen tester.  Here is an example of a query Im running on localhostphpmyadminp  precodeSELECT  FROM ipstealer as ipstr WHERE id  9 union select 1,2,3,4,5 ORDER BY ipstr.id ASC LIMIT 0 , 30 codepre  pWhere I can inject after WHERE ID  inputherep  pSo basically, the query works fine if I do thisp  precodeSELECT  FROM ipstealer WHERE id  9 union select 1,2,3,4,5 ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 0 , 30 codepre  pBut I want to inject it using aliases ipstr.  So my question is, how can I fix this problem with the injection so that it works as wanted in the first query  I cant figure out how to do this only using one query.

Negative 1966 pIm trying to solve problem which appears during this casep  ol liUser can initiate data loading from external source, when data is loaded, it is saved via CoreData. Then it is displayed in some views and some other classes got references to NSManagedObjects.li liData loading can be initiated by other condition for example, when application resumes from background. New external data is received, dataController deletes previous and creates new data. And here is the problem.  I want to notify all data consumersclasses that they should load new instances send them references to deleted objects, so they can compare references with ones they own and determine should they ask for new data version or not. But after deletion consumerclass has reference to fault without properties, its ObjectID is useless because new instance was saved and I dont know how load its new version.li ol  pI can implement some NSManagedObject wrapperp  precodeinterface Model  NSObject   idinitWithUniqueIdiduniqueId dataObjectNSManagedObject dataObject  property nonatomic, strong, readonly id uniqueId property nonatomic, strong, readonly NSManagedObject dataObject  end codepre  pThis object can reload itself after dataObject becomes fault. But maybe this approach is wrong and this overhead is not needed And NSManagedObject should be deleted only if it is really deleted, not updated And then if object is updated, we can use KVO to handle properties changes, and if object is deleted, we can observe NSManagedObjectContext notifications for changes and look for deleted objects.p  pI just want to know which way would you prefer and why maybe you like some other approach Thanks in advance.p

Negative 1966 pI have a bridge table codebookpersoncode between tables codebookcode and codepersoncode to provide manytomany relation. In this table I also have roledefinitions, to set which roles author, editor, illustrator, translator etc. a person has on particular book. Now I consider to split roles to separate role tables like codebookauthorcode, codebooktranslatorcode etc. But I am in doubt, is it good idea or not For pros, it makes DB more clean and one simple benefit I see that DBIC schema loader detects such simple bridgetables and creates manytomany accessors to me. For cons I see that aggregating functions for roles will need more joinings.p  pWhat are the benefits of using separate rolebridgetable over allinone rolebridgetable And what are shortcomings I am trying to upgrade my apps using ORM DBIxClass, but not knowing it well yet, so considerations towards it are also really welcome.p

Negative 1966 pIm writing a simple window manager as a hobby project, and Ive chosen python and xlib to implement it. Id like to have some fancy effects like windows sliding from left and right, and from what Ive been able to dig up, the best way to go about this is to use the composite extension to render windows to offscreen buffers, and then manipulate those buffers and paint them however I want.p  pHowever, with pythonxlib documentation somewhat lacking, I found no way to do this, and I havent found any examples of using pythonxlib with the composite extension. Where can I find this information, and has anyone used pythonxlib with compositep  pI suppose I could always switch to xcb which seems to support composite for python, but Id prefer not having to rewrite the whole thing and figure out a different API with somewhat lacking python documentation.p  pTo summarize, my questions are p  ul liIs there a way to use composite with pythonxlib  li liWould it be a better idea to switch to xcb for thisli ul  pAny additional suggestions and advice are welcome.p

Negative 1966 pI had a project where I was using Region monitoring with a varied amount of success, for the most part it worked, but not as accurate as i hoped, but soon discovered its not supposed to be dead accurate and this is fine, just physically testing it was difficult. Nevertheless they wanted a complete user interface overall hall done in a day. so here is what i did.p  pI took the old project, duplicated it and renamed it, bundle ID and all and the where ever else i think needed it to make it essentially a different project. I then created a storyboard as i was using xib files previously. And then changed the launch procedures to make it use the storyboard instead of the preexisting xib files. all worked dandy. have the new interface and essentially the same code.p  pProblem...p  pThe regions never trigger...ever, even though locations services is working as i use location services to tell me if im within the radius of one or not, but the fence callback API just never goes off. I then tested it on multiple devices. and finally one of them triggered...But low and behold it was the old app, it triggers fences no problem. whereas the new one does not. I cant even begin to fathom what i have done wrong that would cause this. I even use the api did fail and did succeed methods and it says the fences register no problem.p  panother vexing issue is, if I use GPX files to simulate location, the fences trigger in code...Frustrating stuff I must say.p  pAny suggestions will provide code examples if needed.p

Sometimes the user has to spend time abbreviating their notes to make it fit on the page.  I was thinking I could allow them to change the fontsize and save that info.  Then they can recreate the PDF and see if it fits.  I can see where a global fontsize might be a little tricky.  I need some type of dialog box to allow the user to make a global font selection. p

Negative 1966 pfirst time posting here.p  pI am experiencing the strangest problem and can honestly say I have never seen this before. I have an internal URL forwarding service where my clients can create a keyword and have that keyword redirect to the target they specify. This has been working GREAT, however, today I was informed of an issue with a redirect to a PDF.p  pOne of my users created a shortURL to a PDF and complained the clickthrough stats were way off. When I researched the issue, I noticed quite a few clients attempted what I would call a redirect loop.p  pEssentially they kept requesting the shortURL over and over, with different byte ranges. This keeps happening sometimes I see 6070 of these in a row. Ive tried changing the cache headers etc. etc, but nothing I do seems to be able to fix this. Even tried changing the 302 to a 301. No Luck.   Any feedback would greatly be appreciated. Thanks Guysp  pHere is a snippet I captured via tcpdumpp  precodeGET ShowcaseGuide HTTP1.1 Accept  Referer wwww.someinternalserver.com AcceptLanguage enUS UserAgent Mozilla5.0 compatible MSIE 10.0 Windows NT 6.1 WOW64 Trident6.0 AcceptEncoding gzip, deflate Host goto.mydomain.org DNT 1 Connection KeepAlive Cookie spersxxxxxx   HTTP1.1 302 Found Date Tue, 19 Nov 2013 200952 GMT Server Apache2.2.3 Red Hat XPoweredBy PHP5.3.3 Expires Thu, 19 Nov 1981 085200 GMT CacheControl private, mustrevalidate Pragma nocache Location httpinternalserver.mydomain.orglinksGettheMostOutoftheShowcase.pdf Vary AcceptEncoding ContentEncoding gzip ContentLength 20 KeepAlive timeout5, max200 Connection KeepAlive ContentType texthtml charsetUTF8  GET ShowcaseGuide HTTP1.1 Accept  Range bytes21785602179071, 21790722179369 AcceptEncoding gzip, deflate UserAgent Mozilla5.0 compatible MSIE 10.0 Windows NT 6.1 WOW64 Trident6.0 Host goto.mydomain.org DNT 1 Connection KeepAlive Cookie spersxxxxxx  HTTP1.1 302 Found Date Tue, 19 Nov 2013 200956 GMT Server Apache2.2.3 Red Hat XPoweredBy PHP5.3.3 Expires Thu, 19 Nov 1981 085200 GMT CacheControl private, mustrevalidate Pragma nocache Location httpinternalserver.mydomain.orglinksGettheMostOutoftheShowcase.pdf Vary AcceptEncoding ContentEncoding gzip ContentLength 20 KeepAlive timeout5, max199 Connection KeepAlive ContentType texthtml charsetUTF8  GET ShowcaseGuide HTTP1.1 Accept  Range bytes18677761884159 AcceptEncoding gzip, deflate UserAgent Mozilla5.0 compatible MSIE 10.0 Windows NT 6.1 WOW64 Trident6.0 Host goto.mydomain.org DNT 1 Connection KeepAlive Cookie spersxxxxxx  HTTP1.1 302 Found Date Tue, 19 Nov 2013 200957 GMT Server Apache2.2.3 Red Hat XPoweredBy PHP5.3.3 Expires Thu, 19 Nov 1981 085200 GMT CacheControl private, mustrevalidate Pragma nocache Location httpinternalserver.mydomain.orglinksGettheMostOutoftheShowcase.pdf Vary AcceptEncoding ContentEncoding gzip ContentLength 20 KeepAlive timeout5, max198 Connection KeepAlive ContentType texthtml charsetUTF8 codepre

Heres a description of itp  blockquote   pDesign a game where each player picks a number.  One player is the   user and the other is the computer.  The players take turns guessing   the window range of the number or the number.  If the player selects   the correct range, it costs a turn.  If the player selects an   incorrect range, it costs 2 turns.  If the player tries to guess the   number it does not cost a turn.  The game ends when the player guesses   the correct number.p blockquote  pBelow is the code I have written so far.

My question, though, is why when I emdontem use pkgutil, this still works fine, but only on some platformsparticularly, in OSX and Ubuntu 10 and 12 that Ive seen, it works, but in Windows 7 it doesnt. What I worry is that there is some sideeffect of using pkgutil that Im not considering.p  pThe specific nonworking behavior is that PYTHONPATH appears to be constructed correctly after that script is run in the code.bashrccode equivalent in PowerShell, i.e. I can debug print PYTHONPATH from within Python and it is identical to the path constructed on another platform. However, codefrom projectname1 import foocode succeeds, and codefrom projectname2 import barcode fails presumably because projectname2 is globbed later by alpha. Thats actually the behavior I would expect without pkgutil. Why isnt that the behavior in OSX and Ubuntu Is this problem from some pathing mechanism of Windows or PowerShell, or the Python binaries as compiled on Windows, or something else entirelyp  pEDIT Adding the below for more clarityp  precode dprojectsgt [Environment]SetEnvironmentVariablePYTHONPATH,dprojectsprojectname1libpythondprojectsprojectname2libpython  dprojectsgt echo envPYTHONPATH  dprojectsprojectname1libpythoneprojectsprojectname2libpython  dprojectsgt python  import sys sys.path  gt [, ..python install dir..libsitepackagespip1.2.1py2.7.egg, dprojectsprojectname1libpython, dprojectsprojectname2libpython, ...usual stuff...] import logicalpackage logicalpackage.path  gt [dprojectsprojectname1libpythonlogicalpackage] import logicalpackage.projectname1 as p1 import logicalpackage.projectname2 as p2   Traceback most recent call last    File ltstdingt, line 1, in ltmodulegt  ImportError No module named projectname2  exit codepre  preplace the empty codeinit.pycode with the pkgutils code mentioned abovep  precode dprojectsgt python import sys sys.path  gt [, DusrPython2732bitlibsitepackagespip1.2.1py2.7.egg, dprojectsprojectname1libpython, dprojectsprojectname2libpython, dprojects, ...etc...] import logicalpackage logicalpackage.path  gt [dprojectsprojectname1libpythonlogicalpackage, dprojectsprojectname2libpythonlogicalpackage] import logicalpackage.projectname1 as p1 import logicalpackage.projectname2 as p2 codepre  pNote No exception.

Negative 1966 pI am using an OFX download function written in Python similar to ofxclient to download bank and credit card transactions. However, it only retreives posted transactions, not ones that are in progress.  This results in the account infomation frequently being out of date by a day or more. I realize these pending transactions could be temporary holds, etc. But most of the time they turn into permanent transactions after they post or drop.  But is there some different OFX command I can use to request pending transactions, with the understanding that they are subject to change It is possible to see them from the web site of every financial institution I have tried, but trying to scrape web sites is out of the question and OFX I though was designed to avoid the need for such nonstandard procecures.p

The way Ive written this function it can handle only one. If a query handles more than that, I would have to write another function for each one that binds a different amount of parameters. That mainly copy and paste work but it kind of negates the usefulness of putting this in a function.p  pwhen it comes to the type, this is simply a string, so if a query binds 5 parameters, I can simply give itp  precodetype  sssss codepre  pNot a problem. I havent found out how I can do this for the variables that will be bound. Is there a way that I can somehow feed my function a scope or array of variables function within the function perhaps that will generate them automatically so I can keep all of these queries within a single functionp  pSay if I need to bind 3 parameters.

Negative 1966 pIve been having some trouble applying correct velocity changes to my ball when it hits bricks in my Breakout clone. In a previous question, I was advised to use continuous collision detection, as well as other methods such as finding the intersection between the ball and the brick when it hits a corner to determine which direction the ball should reflect. Ive applied this to my code below, but there are still occasions when the ball will just completely plow through a collection of bricks.

Negative 1966 pI am writing a program to serve a live audio stream to a browser. The language is Purebasic with its builtin networking functions. I am trying to serve audio to Mozilla Firefox running an HTML5 page. The HTML5 code works fine as I can receive other online audio streams e.g. from Triton sites. The program uses PortAudio and serves packets of audio delivered by PortAudio written to disk and encoded to mp3 using the Lame encoder. PureBasics SendNetworkData is used to send the mp3 data. It returns the number of bytes transmitted by my server program. Upon examination I am able to send a few packets successfully and then for some reason the transmissions stop being successful  the SendNetworkData function returns 1 which means the packets were not successfully sent. If I use a client program of my own creation I am able to send packets indefinitely. Ive tried disabling the firewall, no joy. After a couple of dozen packets its as if the connection goes dead, but with Firefox only, not with my own client program. I am also sending a header with HTTP 1.1 200 OK and ContentTypeaudiompeg. OS is Windows 7. The PortAudio part works fine.p

Negative 1966 pI saw this description in the Oracle website  Since TCP by its nature is a stream based protocol, in order to reuse an existing connection, the HTTP protocol has to have a way to indicate the end of the previous response and the beginning of the next one. Thus, it is required that all messages on the connection MUST have a selfdefined message length i.e., one not defined by closure of the connection.

So if, for instance, I click a back button on a covering surface, and theres a back button on the surface below it, both back buttons will fire and remove both surfaces.p  pWhen I remove FastClick, the problem is solved, but the 300ms delay returns.p  pIve checked the problem on a desktop and it is not occurring, even when FastClick is present.

Thats all I want to do  but from an external app. Im not looking for a symbol, just a line. p  pIm using Delphi XE5 at the moment, so Im interested in newer Delphi versions, not preXE2 or so.p  pPart of the question is, how do I ensure that if the IDE is already open, the the file is opened in anew tab inside of the current IDE rather than in another instance of the IDEp

There is about 100 user at peak time may grow to 300 in the near future which makes it about 200.000 records of logs which is pushed to the MySQL Database each day.

I cant find a single solid example, or tutorial, on where to do this.  I was hoping someone had some insight in to thisp

Negative 1966 pI am trying to understand the way the codeYourCastcode codeRcode package works and make it work with my data.p  pFor example, if a function produces errors, I p  ul liget the source code of that function using codeYourCastbad.fncodeli liadd outputs of critical values at critical stagesli liuse codereassignInPackagenameoriginal.fn, packageYourCast, valuemy.fncodeli ul  pOnce I find the cause of the error, I fix it in the function and reassign it in the package.p  pHowever, for some strange reason this does not work for nonhidden functions.p  pFor examplep  precodeinstall.packagesYourCast LibraryYourCast YourCastcheck.depvar codepre  pThis will print the emhiddenem function codecheck.depvarcode. One line codeif allix  13code will produce an error message if any of the codexcode is missing.p  pThus, I change the whole function to the following and replace the original formulap  precodemzuba.check.depvar lt functionformula   return grepllog[],as.characterformula[2]   reassignInPackagecheck.depvar,                    pkgNameYourCast,                    mzuba.check.depvar rmmzuba.check.depvar codepre  pNow codeYourCastcheck.depvarcode will print my version of that function, and everything is fine.p  pHoweverp  pcodeYourCastyourcastcode or codeYourCastyourcastcode or simply codeyourcastcode will print the emnonhiddenem function codeyourcastcode. Suppose I want to change that function as well.p  precodereassignInPackagenameyourcast,                pkgNameYourCast,                valuetest codepre  pNow, codeYourCastyourcastcode and codeYourCastyourcastcode will print the new, modified version but codeyourcastcode emstill gives the old versionemp  pThat might not a problem if I could simply call codeYourCastyourcastcode instead of codeyourcastcode, but that produces some kind of error emthat I cant trace back because suddenly RStudio does not print error messages at all anymoreem, although it still emdoes somethingem if it is capable top  precodegt Uagh do something gt 1  1 [1] 2 gt Why no error msg gt codepre  pRestarting the Rsession will solve the errormsg problem, though.p  pSo my question is strongHow do I reassign nonhidden functions in packagesstrongp  pFurthermore this would faciliate testing a lot, is there a way to make all hidden functions available without using the codecode operator I.e., strongHow to export all functions from a packagestrongp

Negative 1966 pIm a big fan of the Javafx 2 builder notation, however it has been deprecated in Java 8 and I need to replace my old code in a large codebase.  Id like to keep a similar programming style.

My question is does this have any drawbacks similar to double brace initialization  The object itself is not an anonymous class, but am I essentially doing the same thing by creating an anonymous class for the lambda  The lambdas should be garbage collected, correct  Do I even need to worry about this now that permgen space is gone in JDK8  Does anyone else have better way of initializing javafx classes besides using FXMLp  pEdit updated example with suggestion from BenjaminGalep

I have a strongUserstrong which can have many strongRolesstrong, but the strongRolesstrong are global, so I have set up a table structure as followsp  precodeCREATE TABLE [dbo].[Users]     [Id] [nvarchar]128 NOT NULL,     [UserName] [nvarchar]max NULL,     [Email] [nvarchar]max NULL,     [DateCreated] [datetime] NOT NULL,     [DateModified] [datetime] NULL,     [LastLoginDate] [datetime] NOT NULL,     [PasswordHash] [nvarchar]max NULL, CONSTRAINT [PKdbo.Users] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED   CREATE TABLE [dbo].[UserRoles]     [UserId] [nvarchar]128 NOT NULL,     [RoleId] [nvarchar]128 NOT NULL,  CONSTRAINT [PKdbo.UserRoles] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED       [UserId] ASC,     [RoleId] ASC   CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Roles]     [Id] [nvarchar]128 NOT NULL,     [Name] [nvarchar]max NULL, CONSTRAINT [PKdbo.Roles] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED       [Id] ASC  codepre  pThe strongUserRolesstrong table has foriegn keys set up for both the strongRolesstrong and strongUsersstrong table on the respective strongIdstrong columns.p  pIn my code, I have thisp  precodepublic class User  IUser      public string Id  get set        Stripped for brevity      public IListltUserRolegt Roles  get set       public User              this.Id  Guid.NewGuid.ToString        public class UserRole      public string RoleId  get set      public string UserId  get set    public class Role  IRole      public string Id  get set      public string Name  get set      public IListltUserRolegt Users  get set       public Role              this.Id  Guid.NewGuid.ToString       codepre  pstrongEntityFrameworkstrong is fine with this class and with my mapping as followsp  precodemodelBuilder.EntityltUserRolegt.HasKeym gt new  m.UserId, m.RoleId  codepre  pEverything for the mapping works. Now what I would really like, is for the strongUserstrong class to have a list of strongRolesstrong and not strongUserRolesstrong.p  pSo, I would like it to look like thisp  precodepublic class User  IUser      public string Id  get set        Stripped for brevity      public IListltRolegt Roles  get set       public User              this.Id  Guid.NewGuid.ToString       codepre  pI am sure you can see the problem here. Can someone think of a solution where my table structure stays the same, but I can access the strongRolesstrong instead of the strongUserRolesstrongp  pSorry if my explanation is not good.p

I suspect that I require a multitude of Threads, but where do I place them and how can I update my objects from within the Threadp  pPerhaps I misplaced the Ball and Paddle objects into the wrong classp  pstrongMain Classstrongp  precodepackage com.N00744323.pingpong  import javax.swing.JFrame  public class Display          static JFrame frame     public static void mainString[] args               frame  new JFramePing Pong         frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE          frame.getContentPane.addnew GUI          frame.pack         frame.setVisibletrue       codepre  pstrongGUI frame classstrongp  precodepackage com.N00744323.pingpong  import java.awt.Color import java.awt.Dimension import java.awt.Graphics import java.awt.event.KeyEvent import java.awt.event.KeyListener  import javax.swing.JPanel  public class GUI extends JPanel      private static final long serialVersionUID  1L      final private int WIDTH  750, HEIGHT  500      private Paddle p1, p2     private Ball b      public GUI                 addKeyListenernew DirectionListener         p1  new Paddle1         p2  new Paddle2         b  new Ball         setBackgroundColor.black          setPreferredSizenew DimensionWIDTH, HEIGHT         setFocusabletrue           public int getWIDTH              return WIDTH          public int getHEIGHT              return HEIGHT           public void paintComponentGraphics page              super.paintComponentpage          page.setColorColor.black         page.fillRect0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT          page.setColorColor.white         page.fillRectp1.getLocX, p1.getLocY, p1.getWIDTH, p1.getHEIGHT         page.fillRectp2.getLocX, p2.getLocY, p2.getWIDTH, p2.getHEIGHT          page.fillOvalb.getLoc[0], b.getLoc[1], b.getSIZE2, b.getSIZE2           private class DirectionListener implements KeyListener              public void keyPressedKeyEvent e                       int key  e.getKeyCode             ifkey  KeyEvent.VKUP                              p1.setLocY3                 System.out.printlnUp                          else                     ifkey  KeyEvent.VKDOWN                                      p1.setLocY3                     System.out.printlnDown                              repaint                   public void keyReleasedKeyEvent e                       int key  e.getKeyCode              ifkey  KeyEvent.VKUP                              System.out.printlnUp stopped                          else                     ifkey  KeyEvent.VKDOWN                                      System.out.printlnDown stopped                                    public void keyTypedKeyEvent e                       int key  e.getKeyCode              ifkey  KeyEvent.VKUP                              p1.setLocY2                 System.out.printlnUp                          else                     ifkey  KeyEvent.VKDOWN                                      p1.setLocY2                     System.out.printlnDown                               repaint                codepre  pstrongPaddle object classstrongp  precodepackage com.N00744323.pingpong  public class Paddle      final private int WIDTH  10, HEIGHT  45     private int locY, locX      public Paddleint player              ifplayer  1                      locY  5002  HEIGHT             locX  20                  ifplayer  2                      locY  5002  HEIGHT             locX  750WIDTH20                    public void setLocYint locY              iflocY  this.locY gt 0 ampamp this.locY  locY lt 500  HEIGHT             this.locY  locY           public int getLocY              return locY           public int getLocX              return locX           public int getWIDTH              return WIDTH           public int getHEIGHT              return HEIGHT       codepre  pstrongBall object classstrongp  precodepackage com.N00744323.pingpong  public class Ball      final private int SIZE  5     private int x, y      public Ball              x  7502  SIZE2         y  5002  SIZE2           public int getSIZE              return SIZE           public int[] getLoc              int[] pos  x, y         return pos           public void setLocint[] pos              x  pos[0]         y  pos[1]       codepre  pThanksp

Negative 1966 pI got specs that need a little work before I can be sure it can be implemented. Id appreciate to hear comments and suggestions on the following scenariop  pI need a web software where users log in. All users have a user account AND can have 03 secondary user accounts, which they can use via the main website while authenticated. The secondary user accounts are controlled by a thirdparty javascript library, but I can control the usernames and passwords that are stored in a database.p  pGoal is to enable users to not have to authenticate several times, only using one user account and the ohter ones should work automatically via script.p  pSo, is there a viable, secure and proper way to accomplish this I know playing with user names and passwords in script is a security issue in itself but hopefully I can find the next best thing if this cant be done properly. I will use Asp.Net MVC as a platform, with all calls made using ajax, so the software will look and feel like a single page application. The underlying technology is irrelevant though, any server side technology can be used here.p  pThere are some options to play with p  ul liBasically I can use any user name and password for authentication, its just a matter of which fields in which tables to compareli liI can force all of the user accounts passwords to be the same so user doesnt have to rememberuse many passwordsli liI can retrieve the secondary user names from db in the login call so the website will have access to secondary user names, but obviously I cant do that to passwords as they are hashedsalted in the dbli ul  pHeres one thought Ive been toying around withp  pFirst show a login page. Authentication is done via ajax and credentials are saved on the login form, which gets hidden when user logs in. In the success callback event of the login call we can show the main content that the ajax call can return this could be something like the main page of the authenticated users. Since the original credential fields are still on the page they can be accessed via script and used for the secondary system credentials.p  pHowever, Im not convinced this is a secure way to handle the secondary system logins, even though I could have https throughout the site. I just dont know what the actual security issue here would be. Comments, experts Better ways to accomplish the samep  pThe login page and main structure could look like this a VERY simple examplep  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt     ltmeta charsetutf8 gt     ltscript typetextjavascript srcScriptsjquery2.1.0.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt         function VerifyUsername, pass, remember, container              .ajax                 type POST,                 contentType applicationjson charsetUTF8,                 url AccountVerifyUser,                 data JSON.stringify userid name, password pass ,                 processData false,                 success function response                      if response.Success                           Here I could stash the password somewhere if needed.

Negative 1966 pIm using the coderequestcode npm module to access a REST service, that needs at some point requires a backslash codecode in part of the path to escape a especial character it implements a small query DSL.p  pTo my surprise, request is converting those backslashes to forward slashes codecode. Ive drilled down the problem a little bit more and it seems that it is calling codeurl.parsecode under the hood and that is the culprit. I can pass a codeurl.parsecode result with the proper path, but I dont see any option to avoid the back to forward slash conversion.p  pThe ugly option might be to hack the codeurl.parsecode result myself...p

Negative 1966 pSo Im making a program which calls a function to do some calculations, and there are buttons to press to change the inputs and recalculate.p  pIt works great, except if a button is pressed before the calculations are finished, the new values are calculated and outputted before returning back to the previous values.  Basically, the program does what I want, except it returns to the first calculations after button press and completing second calculations all the variable values return.p  pA general schematic of the problem 1. Root mainloop 2. Values inputted 3. Press Go 4. Calculations printed to screen Monty Carlo sim by the way 5. Press button to change input values 6. New calculations printed to screen 7. Once new ones finish, calculations for old variable values return until completionp  pIs there a way to prevent python from returning to the previous variable values like this  My hope is that there is a way to return to the mainloop so that the calculations on the screen stay correct.

Negative 1966 pI had SQL Server Express 2012 on my old laptop and my SQL batch process used to complete in about 12 hours. Then I got a new better laptop, copied the database over but now the batch takes a lot longer, about 2430 hours. I checked the indexes, constraints etc. They are exactly the same. The only difference is that on old laptop I had SQL Server 32 bit and new one has 64 bit.p  pI notice that it starts running faster than the old laptop but then slows down as the batch progresses. When I restart the SQL Server process, it again starts running fast but then slows down again. So the same query in exactly the same database condition is often taking a lot longer to complete depending on when I did the restart.p  pIs there any way I can fix this problem. If not, is there any way to automate the restarting of sql server so that the batch runs smoothly without manual intervention.p

Negative 1966 pI would like to know what would be the best mechanism to implement multiple Producer  single Consumer scenario, where i have to keep the current number of unprocessed requests up to date.p  pMy first thought was to use ConcurrentLinkedQueuep  precodepublic class SomeQueueAbstraction       private QueueltSomeObjectgt concurrentQueue  new ConcurrentLinkedQueueltgt     private int size      public void addObject request          SomeObject object  convertIncomingRequestrequest            concurrentQueue.addobject         size            public SomeObject getHead          SomeObject object  concurrentQueue.poll         size            other methods codepre  pProblem with this is that i have to explicitly synchronize on codeaddcode and codesize code, as well as on the codepollcode and codesizecode, to have always accurate codesizecode which makes codeConccurentLinkedQueuecode pointless to begin with.p  pWhat would be the best way to achieve as good as possible performance  while maintaining data consistency p  pShould I use codeArrayDequeuecode instead and explicitly synchronize or there is a better way to achieve this p  pThere is sort of similar questionanswer herep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions435069javautilconcurrentlinkedqueue435941435941java.util.ConcurrentLinkedQueueap  pwhere it is discussed how composite operations on codeConcurrentLinkedQueuecode are naturally not atomic but there is no direct answer what is the best option for the given scenario.p  pNote I am calculating size explicitly because time complexity for inherent .size method is On.p  pNote2 I am also worried that getSize method, which i havent explicitly written, will add to even more contention overhead. It could be called relatively frequently.p  pI am looking for the most efficient way to handle Multiple Producers  single Consumer with frequent getSize calls.p  pAlternative suggestion  If there was elementId in SomeObject structure, i could get current size from ConcurrentLinkedQueue.poll and only locking would have to be done within mechanism to generate such id. Add and get could now properly be used without additional locking. How would this fare as an alternative p

Negative 1966 pMy question is pretty simple how do I get the standard outputinputerror of a process I did not start Lets say I have some program that is not mine XYZ that runs all day and prints things to stdout. I want to be able to start my C application and start reading XYZs output. Then close my C application and restart it 2 hours later and continue reading the output not necessarily where I left off but that would be a plus.p  pI know this can be achieved if XYZ is a child process of mine withp  precodeserverProcess  Process.Startnew ProcessStartInfo      RedirectStandardError  true,     RedirectStandardInput  true,     RedirectStandardOutput  true,     WorkingDirectory  WorkingDir,     Arguments  Args,     FileName  XYZ,     UseShellExecute  false  serverProcess.OutputDataReceived  serverProcessOutputDataReceived serverProcess.ErrorDataReceived  serverProcessOutputDataReceived serverProcess.BeginOutputReadLine serverProcess.BeginErrorReadLine codepre  pBut this is not the case since XYZ is is completely independent of my application, and needs to keep running regardless of what I do to it. It is worth noting that if it helps I can start XYZ myself with those redirection parameters. Its just that my lifecycle needs to be completely independent of XYZ, and I need to be able to reattach after I relaunch.p  pI have seen some suggestions using GetSetStdHandle but most of them claimed to not work, and I dint quite understand how to apply them anyways.p  pThanks for any advicep

Negative 1966 pIm developing a booking system for hostels. Each room has a different amount of beds inside room.capacity.  Its possible that different reservations share a single room with three beds for example. Its also possible that a single reservation takes up a whole room and its capacity, or even take up multiple beds from different rooms. The idea is, rather than in a classical hotel booking system where you book on a perroom basis, in my system all works on a perbed basis. Basically in the backend you add a new room and define a capacity, rather than adding every single bed. It its not necessesary to know who has which bed, but its important to know which room and if the capacity limit is reached or if there are still rooms left in a room.p  pIm looking for a way to select ALL ROOMS with their CAPACITY  AVAILABLE BEDS depending on the entries in reservationroom.p  pI tried around for hours with a massive query likep  precodeSELECT room.id, room.name, room.roomcategoryid, room.status, room.capacity  FROM room WHERE SELECT COUNTreservationroom.id         FROM reservationroom         WHERE reservationroom.id  room.id AND  WHERE SELECT reservation.start, reservation.end         FROM reservation         WHERE NOT reservation.start gt date1 AND              NOT reservation.end lt date2        UNION        SELECT COUNTid AS bedsavailable        FROM reservationroom        WHERE reservationroom.id  room.id codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4Kkq1.png alttable layoutp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1966 pIf I use a bunch of temporary variables in a script and dont unset them e.g. arrays used to collect error messages, my assumption is that they will remain in memory until the script ends.p  pSince PHP is so dynamic, its possible that I could refer to the variable later in the script, like thisp  precodeltphp someTempVar  array... lots of stuff ...  never used again directly  but used indirectly theVarName  someTempVar echo implode, , theVarName codepre  pAnd because of this, anything outside of a function cannot be garbage collected until the script ends.p  pThere are four approaches I can think of to deal with this problem.p  ol liIgnore it  assume memory usage is not an issue.li liSeparate all script execution into functions, so that temporary variables always go out of scope relatively quicklyli liUse codeunsetcode to destroy variables when done using themli liUse the same variable names over and over for temporary objectsli ol  pI think most people follow approach 1, but IMO the memory usage of all the scripts running on a busy server can add up quickly, especially if the scripts run for any reasonably not short length of time.p  pApproach 2 isnt too bad and has the benefit of making the code selfdocumenting, but making functions that wont be reused anywhere else is frowned upon by some.p  pApproach 3 is probably the easiest to implement and does exactly what we want, but its prone to bugs.p  pApproach 4 will limit you to having as many things in memory as the maximum number of temporary objects that you need at any one time, so it may not reduce your memory footprint depending on how the program is structured, and is incredibly bad for selfdocumentationness.p  pWhich of these approaches do you use Or do you use another approach Is there a best practices guideline about this that many people are following And is my understanding of the limits of the garbage collector correctp

Negative 1966 pOur current authorization strategy on our site is very tightly coupled to our RDBs schema  which in some ways is a good thing, since it means the permissions available to a user exactly match what he should have, assuming a correct interpretation of the data. So when we query for authorization, were asking about foreign keym2m relationships.p  pI see two main problems with this first, interpreting relational data is much more difficult to get right than reading explicit permissions from a separate table. The bigger problem I see is that this does not scale. As the app has grown, our permissions checks have gone from a single query across three tables to multiple queries across ten or more tables. p  pThe strategy Ive seen in a lot of places that solves this problem is explicit authorization roles or claimsbased for example. Because this kind of thing is simple enough to just stick in a single table, it seems simpler, faster, and more scalable. The thing that bothers me about it is this how do you avoid duplication of data p  pFor example, I have a User that owns a Design. Thats currently accomplished with a foreign key. In switching to explicit authorization, I would add the users id to a table containing the designs id and type. Should I remove the foreign key as well Should permissionsrelevant relationships always be mediated by the permissions table, or should I duplicate the data between the relational representation and the permissions table p  pIt seems like one the downsides of moving to explicit authorization could include performance, especially if a service call or something was required to fully discover permissions.p

It creates p  ol liuserli lidetails about himname, address etcli lihis content 0..10 links on images on my pcli liOne his postli liAdds links from this post to some of his contentli liAdds links from post to 0..10 users users, that liked this postli ol  pI want to go at least 10.000 times through this iteraion creating 10k full accompanied users. I made some improvements from first version, they reduced perfoming time a lot, but anyway it takes too long. Now after 5k it needs like 3 seconds to go through iteration.p  pI dont know how to improve further. All methods work equally, but ill give you whole controller for better understanding.

Negative 1966 pThis is an oddly specific question. Suppose I had a cell that yields a value of 0.

Negative 1966 pI have a form that makes some calculations based on the data submitted and outputs the results on the same page. I tried setting up a post redirect get script using a header 303 redirect, but that 303 only works in chrome for some reason and not other browsers like firefox or safari. p  pHow can I prevent my form from duplicating a submission if the page is refreshed without using a header redirect p  pIm not asking for a code critique, but if you could suggest some methods to handle this properly it would be appreciated.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI did originally state that header redirects are not working, but I went ahead and gave it another shot as you suggested. Im not sure where Im going wrong w my logic. p  pIf there are posts all the variables are set as sessions, the page is then redirected to clear the post array. When the page reloads the sessions are assigned to variables then unset and destroyed, and those variables are then passed.p  pBut whats happening is the page reloads from the redirect and the data is either not set to the session or the sessions are being unset with the redirect as well.p  pHere are the two blocks of code that processes the POST array and sets them to sessions, and the the second block assigns the sessions to variables then unsets and destroys the sessions.p  precodesessionstart errorreportingEALL inisetdisplayerrors,1  ifcountPOST gt 0      issetPOST[dobmonth] SESSION[dobmonth]  POST[dobmonth]SESSION[dobmonth]  null     issetPOST[dobday] SESSION[dobday]  ltrimsanitizeNumInputPOST[dobday],0SESSION[dobday]   null     issetPOST[dobyear]SESSION[dobyear]  sanitizeNumInputPOST[dobyear]SESSION[dobyear] null      SESSION[dobmonth]  POST[dobmonth]     SESSION[dobday]  POST[dobday]     SESSION[dobyear]  POST[dobyear]          ifissetPOST[submit]     SESSION[submit]  1       headerLocation testform,TRUE,303   if issetSESSION[dobmonth]issetSESSION[dobday]issetSESSION[dobyear]     issetSESSION[dobmonth] month  SESSION[dobmonth]month  null     issetSESSION[dobday] day  ltrimsanitizeNumInputSESSION[dobday],0 day  null     issetSESSION[dobyear]year  sanitizeNumInputSESSION[dobyear]yearnull     issetSESSION[submit]submit  SESSION[submit] submit  null                 Put databaseaffecting code here.            sessionunset     sessiondestroy  codepre

Negative 1966 pOn the sails documentation a hrefhttpsailsjs.orgdocumentationconceptsORMAssociationsOnetoMany.html relnofollowherea it shows modeling one to many associations with what looks like high level referencing. Lets say I want to use mongo to make a post that has a lot of comments on it. I will take the post as the document and in it I will embed all the comments in one attribute. If I did it like the documentation, would the mongo adapter automatically, create a document with the comments embedded or would it do something relational and reference the commentsp  pIf it doesnt embed, how would I go about putting the embedded comments in my modelp  pThanksp

Negative 1966 pI wrote a program called load, to show a loading bar for 045 seconds while another program is starting which has no indication that it is loading. It works exactly as I want when the system is already running, but I have it so it runs at startup which causes the program to take a 145 to start. I am trying to figure out a way to check if it is a fresh system start. I dont have any code yet since I dont know where to start. The only solutions Ive thought of are just making a load1 and load2 where load1 has a loading bar of 145 that is run at startup and load2 is 045. My other idea is trying to schedule a task if that is possible. The only problem with that is that it would display nothing for 100 which kind of defeats the purpose. I dont really like either of these solutions.p  pAnother possibility that would work is if I can check if I am calling it from the desktop or the startup folder. Im having no luck with that though.p

Negative 1966 pI have a .war in which we have a Kinesis Application which processes a stream which contains a single shard. We deploy two instances of the war in production. As a result, I would end up with two workers working on a single stream with a single shard. What is the recommended way to deal with this issue I tried deploying two wars on my dev machine locally, and it seems to be fine in the sense that each record is being processed only once. I know that AWS recommends one instance per shard. From their docsp  precodeTypically, when you use the KCL, you should ensure that the number of instances does not exceed the number of shards except for failure standby purposes. Each shard is processed by exactly one KCL worker and has exactly one corresponding record processor, so you never need multiple instances to process one shard. codepre

Negative 1966 pThere are two techniques for implementing Comet. One uses HTTP streaming, which uses a single persisted TCP connection to send and receive multiple HTTP requestsresponses between clientserver.The second is HTTP long polling, which keeps a connection open by the server, and, as soon as an event occurs, the response is committed and the connection is closed. Then, a new longpolling connection is reopened immediately by the client waiting for new events to arrive.p  pI am using the Faye ruby gem and I noticed it uses CometBayeux out of the box. But I cannot find out which type of Comet technique it uses. I just gather that Bayeux is publishsubscribe protocol. Im curious to know if it suffers the same shortcomings of HTTP streaming and long polling. Does it allow fullduplex communication communication in both directions, and, unlike halfduplex, allows this to happen simultaneously.p

Negative 1966 pI am building a hybrid mobile app using cordova and AngularJs. I have setup a WebSQL to store data locally on my app. I am trying to abstract my WebSQL queries to an Angular service. However, whenever I make a call to method in the service from a controller, nothing gets returned. The results variable clearly returns data from the database when I do a console log on it. However it doesnt seem to return the data to my controller. I understand if you are using plain vanilla JS  or other frameworks with angular then the code needs to be wrapped inside digest  apply function. Im not quite sure how to apply it in this instance since the scope variable is not available inside Angular Services.

Negative 1966 pThis is quite a long description, but stay with me. I am building an iPad application where I need to animate objects over time. The structure of the application is a tableview on the left side, a main view on the right side and a timeline in the bottom.p  pFrom the table view I can drag objects to the main view. I can then change the time using the timeline slider in the bottom. If I now change a position of one object the object saves the position and the time value. This can be done repeated times. When I then hit play on the timeline the objects should animate by moving between the points they where given at the specific time instances.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comXZarH.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXZarH.png altenter image description hereap  pNow my first thought was to implement this by just using UIView.animate between two positions and calculating the duration, and do this repeated times until timeline hits the end. This however doesnt give me good control of the objects since I cant break the animation, so if I wanted to pause that would be hard. Also, a extended implementation might be if I drag on the timeline slider the objects should animate their paths as I drag, which is hard to do with animation, if at all possible.p  pMy second thought was just to use numerical analysis and actually calculate all points for the objects at all defined time instances. This wouldnt be very hard, but my question is if this is good for performance The objects are implemented as custom UIViews and to move them seamlessly I would need to update them at 30 times per second. Right now my timeline sends a notification through NotificationCenter everytime it updates it value, so this should be done 30 times per second, and then I let all objects listen to it and update their position. p  pThe custom view is implemented as followsp  precodeIBDesignable class CircleComponent UIView      var backgroundLayer  CAShapeLayer     var lastLocationCGPoint  CGPointMake0, 0     var dancer Dancer     var color UIColor      initinout dancer Dancer,side Int,posx Int, posy Int          self.dancer  dancer         self.color  dancer.color         super.initframe CGRectx posx, y posy, width side, height side           required initcoder aDecoder NSCoder          super.initcoder aDecoder           override initframe CGRect          super.initframe frame           override func layoutSubviews          super.layoutSubviews         self.backgroundColor  UIColor.clearColor         if backgroundLayer  nil              backgroundLayer  CAShapeLayer             layer.addSublayerbackgroundLayer              let rect  bounds             let path  UIBezierPathovalInRect rect             backgroundLayer.path  path.CGPath             backgroundLayer.fillColor  color.CGColor                   backgroundLayer.frame  layer.bounds       codepre  pThe drag and drop from the tableview and inside the main view is also implemented by using pangesturerecognizers and all this works good. The only thing Im worried about is sending so many notifications and letting all the custom views translate at that frame rate. Is this good for performance or are there other standardized ways of doing this p  pI also looked into SpriteKit and Metal, but since the interaction is so close with the tableview and navigation of the rest of the application I didnt use them. Should I instead look more into SpriteKit or Metalp
