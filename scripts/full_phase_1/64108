The choice there seems to be look at what you need and choose the option 1 or 2 that best fits you.  p  pMy understanding for hasmany through situations seems to be when you have a relationship and you need extra meta data you can use it.  I think that fits this situation.p  pDid I set up option 1 correctly and am I right that indexing the array of [shoeid and active] will give me a faster search Is option 3 an appropriate use of hasmany through  Would my explanation of option 3 workp

Positive 64108 pI have a use case question. In Rails 4.1 if you run a controller method and have redirectto or render at some point in your method you are still allowed to continue execution at that point. Sometimes this results in a AbstractControllerDoubleRenderError if you dont handle your control flow properly. Why is this allowed in Rails It seems like a funny use case to redirect and not stop execution, when would this be appropriatep  pThe full error message is listed belowp  precode  AbstractControllerDoubleRenderError        Render andor redirect were called multiple times in this action. Please note that you may only call render OR redirect, and at most once per action. Also note that neither redirect nor render terminate execution of the action, so if you want to exit an action after redirecting, you need to do something like redirectto... and return. codepre

Positive 64108 pI have just started using caching in a production application to speed things up.  Ive read the primary Rails guide, various blogs, the source itself, etc.  But my head is still not clear on one simple thing when it comes to fragment cachingp  pWhen you destroy the cache after updating the object, are you only updating the single object, or the class  I think just the single object.p  pHeres an examplep  precodelt jobs.each do job gt    lt cachejobsindextableenvironmentsession[merchantid]jobjob do gt     stuff    lt end gt lt end gt codepre  pI use the code above in my jobs index page.  Each row is rendered with some information the user wants, some CSS, clickable to view the individual job, etc.  p  pI wrote this in my Job class modelp  precodeaftersave do     Rails.cache.deletejobsindextableenvironmentmerchantidjobself   end    afterdestroy do     Rails.cache.deletejobsindextableenvironmentmerchantidjobself    end codepre  pI want the individual job objects destroyed from the cache if they are updated or destroyed, and of course newly created jobs get their own cache key the first time they pop on the page.p  pI dont do the Russian doll thing with jobs because this is my god object and is changing all the time.  The cache would almost never be helpful as the collection probably morphs by the minute.p  pIs my understanding correct that in the above view, if I rendered, say, 25 jobs to the first page, I would get 25 objects in my cache with the cache key, and then if I only change the first, its cached value would be destroyed and the next time the jobs page loads, it would be recached while the other 24 would just be pulled from the cachep

Positive 64108 pin a Rails 3 application there are two models assinged to each other by strongbelongstostrong and stronghasonestrong. On both sides there is strongdepended  destroystrong configured for this association.  now I had to add a strongbeforedestroystrong callback in one of these models. the problem is now that this callback is triggered twice when an entity which includes this callback is destroyed.

Negative 64108 pI recently wrote a quickanddirty proofofconcept proxy server in C as part of an effort to get a Java web application to communicate with a legacy VB6 application residing on another server. Its ridiculously simplep  pThe proxy server and clients both use the same message format in the code I use a codeProxyMessagecode class to represent both requests from clients and responses generated by the serverp  precodepublic class ProxyMessage     int Length  message length not including the length bytes themselves    string Body  an XML string containing a requestresponse      writes this message instance in the proper network format to stream      helper for response messages    WriteToStreamStream stream  ...   codepre  pThe messages are as simple as could be the length of the body  the message body.p  pI have a separate codeProxyClientcode class that represents a connection to a client. It handles all the interaction between the proxy and a single client.p  pWhat Im wondering is are they are design patterns or best practices for simplifying the boilerplate code associated with asynchronous socket programming For example, you need to take some care to manage the read buffer so that you dont accidentally lose bytes, and you need to keep track of how far along you are in the processing of the current message. In my current code, I do all of this work in my callback function for codeTcpClient.BeginReadcode, and manage the state of the buffer and the current message processing state with the help of a few instance variables.p  pThe code for my callback function that Im passing to codeBeginReadcode is below, along with the relevant instance variables for context. The code seems to work fine asis, but Im wondering if it can be refactored a bit to make it clearer or maybe it already is. p  precodeprivate enum BufferStates        GetMessageLength,      GetMessageBody    The read buffer. Initially 4 bytes because we are initially  waiting to receive the message length a 32bit int from the client   on first connecting. By constraining the buffer length to exactly 4 bytes,  we make the buffer management a bit simpler, because  we dont have to worry about cases where the buffer might contain  the message length plus a few bytes of the message body.  Additional bytes will simply be buffered by the OS until we request them. byte[] buffer  new byte[4]   A count of how many bytes read so far in a particular BufferState. int totalBytesRead  0   The state of the our buffer processing. Initially, we want  to read in the message length, as its the first thing  a client will send BufferStates bufferState  BufferStates.GetMessageLength   ...ADDITIONAL CODE OMITTED FOR BREVITY...   This is called every time we receive data from  the client.  private void ReadCallbackIAsyncResult ar      try              int bytesRead  tcpClient.GetStream.EndReadar          if bytesRead  0                       No more datasocket was closed.             this.Dispose             return                    The state passed to BeginRead is used to hold a ProxyMessage          instance that we use to build to up the message           as it arrives.

The codeMessageBuffercode would then worry about things like the current codeBufferStatecode and fire an event when it received a complete message, which the codeProxyClientcode could then propagate further up to the main proxy server code, where the request can be processed.p

Negative 64108 pThere are a number of discussions on stackoverflow.com about what is the best iPhone game platformengine.  My question is not necessarily what is the best, but what is the best for an experienced iPhone developer but not not experienced in game design.  This will also be a solo project plus a graphics designer.  Consider I will be working fulltime at my day job and will  need to support a number of other iPhone apps.  In other words, designing the game will be very much a parttime project but needs to go out in 2  4 months.  Ramp up time needs to be quick. Id like to build 2D in the beginning and then go to 3D.p  pI lean toward Unity 3D since it has lots of documentation and help.  From what I can see, the iPhone basic version is 399 and you get the IDE for free.  Can anyone confirmp  pUnity3D is for 3D but Ive read you can still do 2D.  Im trying to find out what is involved there.  One drawback with Unity3D is the 815 second Unity splash screen. Ive also read this doesnt get much better with the higher priced version. But I suppose that is the price you pay for the convenience of having a simpler framework available.p  pCocos2d is a great framework and free but lacks documentation. It also requires much ramp up time to learn its framework and choose a suitable physics engine.  I dont see this route as practical.  I can see learning it across a long timeline as a side project but then you eat into getting your game out the door fairly quick.  If I go with Unity, I probably abandon Cocos2d altogether since I will have invested so much into Unity.p  pDoes my reasoning for Unity sound feasiblep  pEDITp  pBased on some of the comments, here is the type of game Im referring to initially A 2D shooter similar to Zomebieville but most likely without its large feature set.p

I try to hold down SHIFT when clicking and also do the rigthmouseclick, and nothing happens. When I move the mouse away from the 1pixel perimiter I get a greyandred marquee stripes.p  pBottom line is nothing happens no matter what I do.p

Negative 64108 pIn MVC and MVP and similar patterns theres often the approach of the passive view which is as stupid contains as few logic as possible. This should facilitate unit testing and create a clearer separation of view and model.p  pI know that those patterns come in very different flavours and especially the understanding of MVP seems to differ from article to article. Therefore my question is not how do i implement this pattern correctly.p  pI want to improve view and model separation and go for better testability of the application. Therefore id like to go for a passive view. But my question is, where would you put logic that is clearly only view related like a textviewer should scroll the text when the scrollbar is moved. would you put the logic for this into the Presenter Lets say the textviewer has some extended functionality. like setting markings on textpassages. The logic for this makes clearly sense to be put into the Presenter. However, if it is mixed with all the direct logic of the view like scrolling the text the Presenter could become very big, which is also not really a nice design.p  pSo my question is where to put display related logic of a passive view and what functionallity to mix in the Presenter.p  pThanksp

Negative 64108 pSo, Im new to dynamic web design my sites have been mostly static with some PHP, and Im trying to learn the latest technologies in web development which seems to be AJAX, and I was wondering, if youre transferring a lot of data, is it better to construct the page on the server and push it to the user, or is it better to pull the data needed and create the HTML around it on the clientside using JavaScriptp  pMore specifically, Im using CodeIgniter as my PHP framework, and jQuery for JavaScript, and if I wanted to display a table of data to the user dynamically, would it be better to format the HTML using CodeIgniter create the tables, add CSS classes to elements, etc.., or would it be better to just serve the raw data using JSON and then build it into a table with jQuery My intuition says to do it clientside, as it would save bandwidth and the page would probably load quicker with the new JavaScript optimizations all these browsers have now, however, then the site would break for someone not using JavaScript...p  pThanks for the helpp

Negative 64108 pI am in the process of porting an iPhone app to iPad. The layout on the phone is a tab bar with three tabs, two of which contain nav controllers where the user drills down a table view hierarchy.p  pHowever, on the iPad, navigation works as expected in landscape mode, but its not possible to drill down the table view hierarchy in portrait from inside the popover. The root table view shows up OK instantiated in the nib, of course, but the child view shows up without any data in it.p  pThe child table view controller is instantiated alright, but the delegate method tableViewcellForRowAtIndexPath is not called. If one rotates to portrait when already further down in the hierarchy, it is possible to go backwards through it, so popping view controllers from the stack does not seem to be the problem.p  pIm really scratching my head on this one. The view controllers view does appear viewDidAppear is called, but the delegate method for filling the table view cells with data does not fire.p  pI started from the split view template in Xcode, which you would think should make it easy to hook things up the right way.p  pAny help on this most welcome.p  pCheers,p  pGregor Tomasevic Swedenp  pUpdate it is possible to make the data of the child views to appear in portrait by calling [self.view reloadData] in viewDidAppear but not viewWillAppear. However, this displays the data only after the view has slid in place, which is not the behavior one expects as a user. Strangely, it still works as expected in landscape. Me, Im just confused on a slightly higher level now. Anyone got any tipsp  pUpdate2 it may be a bug in the simulator. Seems to work just fine on the device.p
Negative 64108 pI have a solution but it is one that I know is not the greatest and would better be solved with a full rewrite.  Basically I have 3 rewrites that will go to the correct areas I want and do what they need to do.

It all works out great but the urls are a pain in the ass specially if not formatted exactly.p  precodeRewriteEngine On RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteRule bsiadmin bsiadminindex.php [L,QSA] RewriteRule bsiadmin. bsiadminindex.phppage1 [L,QSA] RewriteRule . index.phppage1 [QSA] codepre  pSo the first rule will make sure to direct everything to the directory and not the root index.php, the second rule does the same if there is a page specified.  The last rule will take anything else and make sure it uses the root index.php and goes from there.p  pExample of urlsp  precodehttpmysite.testicecreamid2 codepre  pMy custom uri class would strip this clean and set id as a REQUEST var.p  pI guess what I really want to know is how can I just rewrite a simple url such asp  precodehttpmysite.testpageicecreamampid2 codepre  pASp  precodehttpmysite.testicecreamid2 codepre  pWithout any limitation on how many vars can be passed and the directory that does exist bsiadmin to display without me having to use a uri class to direct it.p  pThanks for the help.p

Negative 64108 pI have a Keil ULINK2  USB emulator box attached to the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiJointTestActionGroup relnofollowJTAGa connector on my board, which is working fine with the CortexM3 CPU onboard TIStellarisLuminaryMicro LM3S series. It seems that both a JTAG and a SWJDP port share the same pins and thus connector on your board on these CPUs.  One appears not to have ITM printf capability, the other does.  p  pThe previous firmware people have always used stdio to UART serial port,  but I need the serial port freed up so that debug messages do not interfere with other data being sentreceived tofrom the serial port, thus I need for trace messages to go elsewhere. Sadly I only have one serial port on this board. I thought that the ITM Trace feature in this CPU meant that I could send debug printf messages directly to my debuggerIDE Keil uVision. The TIStellaris CPU documentation call this feature Serial Wire JTAG Debug Port SWJDP, support for which, I have read, is definitely a feature implemented in the Keil uVision IDE.p  pAdding a printf message to my code causes my code to lock up when I start debugging. The lockup seems to be here in the RTL libraries which are linked into my application, in the function sysopen, at the BKPT instructionp  precode                 sysopen   0x00009D7A B50E      PUSH     r1r3,lr   0x00009D7C E9CD0100  STRD     r0,r1,[sp,0]   0x00009D80 F7FFFC0F  BL.W     strlen 0x000095A2   0x00009D84 9002      STR      r0,[sp,0x08]   0x00009D86 4669      MOV      r1,sp   0x00009D88 2001      MOVS     r0,0x01 gtgt0x00009D8A BEAB      BKPT     0xAB   0x00009D8C BD0E      POP      r1r3,pc codepre  pThe above appears to be part of code called by codertlibinitstdio1code.p  pWhat is going on  I dont know what BKPT does. I assume it raises a software breakpoint which should then be handled by the debugger   Shouldnt the KeilARM ULINK2 software and hardware already be configured for this Is there some trick to making debug printf work with Keil JTAGsw portsp  pI am unsure what the difference between an sw and JTAG port is.  sw means what exactly, I believe it refers to one of two possible modes for the JTAG physical connector on a board, where JTAG is a classic but more limited mode without trace support, and sw mode adds trace support without adding any pins to the JTAG connector layout But this is embedded systems, where being cryptic is the norm. I am new to CortexM3 development, and a lot of this stuff is new to me since the old ARM7TDMI days. But the Keil uVision prints this message out ITM works only with SW port, not with JTAG.   Is SW a different physical port that you have to design on your board I am using a custom designed application board, not a development starter board.p  p[Googling around lets me in on the fact that codesysopencode and some pragma codeusenosemihostingswicode and something else are intimately involved in this puzzle, BRKPT instructions in ROM might be some ARM variant on the SWI softwareinterrupt ARM instruction.]p

When I turned on error checking in the index.php file, and tried to add a product to the cart, I received the followingp  precodeFatal error Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted tried to allocate 62914560 bytes in homebubblegepublichtmlappcodecoreMageCoreModelSessionAbstract.php on line 234 codepre  pIve tried upping php memory to 128M, 512M, even 2048M inside php.ini, .htaccess, and even setting it in index.php withp  precodeinisetmemorylimi, 2048M codepre  pUpping the memory limit to 512 or above doesnt produce the above Fatal Error, but wont allow any item to be added to the cart. It produces the following messagep  precodeThe item cannot be added to the cart. codepre  pNow heres the kicker We moved my client over to a VPS running 768MB Guaranteed w 1.5GB Burst RAM, and I worked extensively with the server techs to optimize the server.p  pHowever, since moving to the VPS, the errors have continued. The site works fine until you try to add an item to the shopping cart.p  pIve searched every magento message board looking for a solution to this bug. Ive disabled all extensions, and even tried installing from a new version of Magento and from a previous version.p  pIve done database repairs, optimization, did a compare and fix with a clean database running a clean version of Magento.p  pAs of now, Im authorized to offer up to two hundred dollars to find someone who can fix this issue once and for all. If you have any insights and answers to this, and think you can fix this, please contact me either here or directly. I can provide server access details and would be able to walk through any questions and possible solutions with you.p  pAlso, my background is not really serveradmin centric but I know my way around a box, and Ive been working with Magento for a few years. Several of my other clients are running sites without issue.p

Negative 64108 pI have a supervisor with two worker processes a TCP client which handles connection to a remote server and an FSM which handles the connection protocol.p  pHandling TCP errors in the child process complicates code significantly. So Id prefer to let it crash, but this has a different problem when the server is unreachable, the maximum number of restarts will be quickly reached and the supervisor will crash along with my entire application, which is quite undesirable for this case. p  pWhat Id like is to have a restart strategy with backoff failing that, it would be good enough if the supervisor was aware when it is restarted due to a crash i.e. had it passed as a parameter to the codeinitcode function.

Negative 64108 pI know that there are several ways to define a function in JavaScript. Two of the most common ones arep  precode1  function add a, b           return a  b        2  var add  function a, b           return a  b       codepre  pI am comfortable with the idea of a function as an object that can be passed around just like any other variable. So I understand perfectly what code2code is doing. Its creating a function and assigning to codeaddcode lets say this is in the global scope, so codeaddcode is a global variable the said function. But then what is happening if I use code1code instead I already know that it makes a difference in execution order if I use code1code then I can refer to codeaddcode before the point in the code where codeaddcode is defined, but if I use code2code then I have to assign my function to codeaddcode before I can start referring to codeaddcode.p  pIs code1code just a shortcut for code2code, albeit one that happens to behave like other Cstyle languages in allowing us to define a function below the point at which its used Or is it internally a different type of function Which is more in the spirit of JavaScript if that isnt too vague a term Would you restrict yourself to one or the other, and if so which onep

Negative 64108 pY  I have 6 parameters for which I know maxi and mini values. I have a complex function that includes the 6 parameters and return a 7th value say Y. I say complex because Y is not directly related to the 6 parameters there are many embeded functions in between.p  ol liI would like to find the combination of the 6 parameters which returns the highest Y value. I  first tried to calculate Y for every combination by constructing an hypercube but I have not enough memory in my computer. So I am looking for kinds of markov chains which progress in the delimited parameter space, and are able to overpass local peaks.li liwhen I give one combination of the 6 parameters, I would like to know the highest local Y value. I tried to write a code with an iterative chain like a markovs one, but I am not sure how to process when the chain reach an edge of the parameter space. Obviously, some algorythms should already exist for this.li ol  pQuestion Does anybody know what are the best functions in R to do these two things I read that optim could be appropriate to find the global peak but I am not sure that it can deal with complex functions I prefer asking before engaging in a long for me process of code writing.

Negative 64108 pIve run the Visual Studio Profiler on my development machine and created a VSP file. On my development machine, the Function Details view lets me see the lines of code that are taking long to run. My question is, how do I send this file to someone else without losing functionality p  pWhen I copy just the VSP file to a different computer and try to open it up in Visual Studio, I get some of the functionality, but I cant see any of the code in the Function Details view, and instead see Source code not available. You may not have the appropriate symbol paths or there was an error loading the symbols. p  pIve tried copying the source and PDB files as well but the same results occur. In the output window, it seems that Visual Studio is trying to look for the PDB files in a path that existed on my development machine, but since its running on a different computer it cant find them.p
Negative 64108 pI have a WPF window, which contains a codeWindowsFormsHostcode element. I need to draw things on top of this element, but the nature of codeWindowsFormsHostcode means that its always on the top of the drawing pile. As I cannot draw in the same WPF window on top of the codeWindowsFormsHostcode component, can I overlay another window on top of itp  pIve tried this in a rudimentary way, but I have a few problemsp  p1 I cant stop windows from other apps going in between the main window, and the overlay window.p  p2 When I AltTab, the overlay window appears in the window list, which is pretty ugly.p  pBasically I need the concept of a child window, and window which to all intents and purposes appears as part of another window. UserControls wont work for me, as the codeWindowsFormsHostcode will emalwaysem draw on top of it.p  pAny Ideasp  hr  pstrongUpdate [May 23 11 at 1013 ]strongp  pThank you both for answers.p  pIve tried the codeChildWindowcode approach, and the codeWindowsFormsHostcode element still draws on top. As I understand it, only a true window can draw on top of a codeWindowsFormsHostcode, anything in the same window will go under the codeWindowsFormsHostcode.p  pAn element with the codeWindowsFormsHostcode will still draw under a WinForms component, they are always drawn on top, and that seems nonnegotiable...p  pI guess what Im looking for is a way to dock an external window to act as part of the main window. On the Mac, there is the concept of a true child window, Im looking for something like that.p

Negative 64108 pA little back ground first, Ive made a doubly linked list using templates. I have an account class in which Ive overloaded the  operator to compare the account IDs. Ive created a linked list to hold the accounts. p  pWhen I add a new account to the list, it calls the contains method which calls the  operator. This is where the error is invoked and g tells me p  blockquote   psll.h In member function bool listcontainsT [with T  account]p      pcustomer.h2535   instantiated from herep      psll.h2613 error no match for operator in tempnodedata  itemp      paccount.h366 note candidate is bool accountoperatoraccountampp blockquote  pIve been investigating for a few hours now and I cant get to the bottom of it. I suspect it may have something to do with the fact that Im using templates.

Negative 64108 pI know there are A LOT of similar or the same questions, but i still cannot understand  find the right way for me to work with modules. Python is my favorite language, and i like everything in it except working with imports recursive imports when you try to reference a name that is not yet there, import paths, etc.p  pSo, I have this kind of a project structurep  precodemyproject     package1         init.py         module1         module2     package2         init.py         module1         module2 codepre  pcodePackage1code may be used a standalone unit, but is also expected to be imported by codepackage2code. What am i doing now, is that, for example, in codepackage1.module1code i write codefrom package1 import module2code, i.e. using full path to imported module. I do this because if i use codeimport module2code  this will not work when the module will be imported from another package codepackage2code. I also cannot use codefrom . import module2code  this will not work when running codemodule1code directly.p  pOK, so for codefrom package1 import module2code in codepackage1.module1code to work in both cases when running directly codepackage1.module1code and when importing it from codepackage2code i add these lines at the beginning of codepackage1.module1codep  precodeimport os, sys currDir  os.path.dirnameos.path.realpathfile rootDir  os.path.abspathos.path.joincurrDir, .. if rootDir not in sys.path  add parent dir to paths     sys.path.appendrootDir codepre  pFor me this works, but i feel this is not pythonic. Am i doing something wrongp  pShould i, instead, always run codepackage1.module1code from project root If so, this makes inconvenient to run it from an IDE  i need somehow to set paths in it.p  pUPDATE I tried to add a file coderoot.pthcode to codepackage1code dir with contents of code..code. But it didnt work  i guess its intended for something else.p  pstrongCONCLUSIONSstrongp  ol lipAlways use absolute imports codeimport package1.module1codepli lipAdd a bootstrapper to the root folder to start some of the modules as a standalone script. This solves running the script form an IDE and is a pythonic approach.pli ol  pOn 42207, Brett Cannon wrotep  blockquote   pThis PEP is to change the codeif name  main ...code idiom to   codeif name  sys.main ...code  so that you at least have a chance   to execute module in a package that use relative imports.p      pRan this PEP past pythonideas.  Stopped the discussion there when too   many new ideas were being proposed.    I have listed all of them in   the Rejected Ideas section, although if overwhelming support for one   comes forward the PEP can shift to one of them.p blockquote  pIm 1 on this and on any other proposed twiddlings of the codemaincode machinery. The only use case seems to be running scripts that happen to be living inside a modules directory, which Ive always seen as an antipattern.

Negative 64108 pI need to perform a comparison between two XML documents. Ive been looking at a lot of different xmldiffing tools typically mentioned here on Stack Overflow, but my needs are, of course, very peculiar and so they dont really fit. In short, I need to compare not the emdocuments as a wholeem, but rather the element emcontentsem While taking emorderem into account, and I need a very specific output format rather than a traditional diff patch.p  pPlease excuse this volume of text, but I find it difficult to explain it shorter.p  pstrongFirst, my limitationsstrongp  pThe solution must be Javabased, or integrateable with a commandline java application. It must also be free, because Im not allowed to spend real money on this, only my work time but not too much of course I have a deadline looming over me ... sounds familiar Lastly, my goal is not a traditional diff patch result but a nonstraightforward combination of both source files.p  pstrongSecond, a description of my datastrongp  pEach document contains nodes of type codetextcode or codesectioncode texts are simple strings but sections can contain both text and more sections they also have a name, given as an attribute. Furthermore, each node is tagged with revision information.p  pHeres a sample document. Note that for brevity, this appears to be a list in actuality its more proselike  that is to say, element order is very important.p  precodeltdocument diff revision1gt   lttext diff revision1gtAppleslttextgt   lttext diff revision1gtChxrrieslttextgt   ltsection diff revision1 nameBlue onesgt     lttext diff revision1gtGrapeslttextgt     ltsection diff revision1 nameMoregt       lttext diff revision1gtBlueberrieslttextgt     ltsectiongt     lttext diff revision1gtOrangeslttextgt   ltsectiongt ltdocumentgt codepre  pThis needs to be compared to a new version, which contains changes but no revision information yet. In this example, Ive fixed a typo in the 2nd element, and Ive moved another element, but there could be much more extensive changes, such as addition or deletion of entire sections.p  precodeltdocumentgt   lttextgtAppleslttextgt   lttextgtOrangeslttextgt   lttextgtCherrieslttextgt   ltsection nameBlue onesgt     lttextgtGrapeslttextgt     ltsection nameMoregt       lttextgtBlueberrieslttextgt     ltsectiongt   ltsectiongt ltdocumentgt codepre  pThe goal is to create a third XML document with all information. Note that the codediffcode tags of the affected elements have been changed  represents a change within the element and their coderevisioncode numbers have been bumped unchanged elements keep their old revision info.p  precodeltdocument diff revision2gt   lttext diff revision1gtAppleslttextgt   lttext diff revision2gtOrangeslttextgt   lttext diff revision2gtChxrrieslttextgt   lttext diff revision2gtCherrieslttextgt   ltsectio diff revision1n nameBlue onesgt     lttext diff revision1gtGrapeslttextgt     ltsection diff revision1 nameMoregt       lttext diff revision1gtBlueberrieslttextgt     ltsectiongt     lttext diff revision2gtOrangeslttextgt   ltsectiongt ltdocumentgt codepre  pThe result, then, is not a diff patch, but a full document with updated revision information.p  pstrongThird, what I do have working  and my problemstrongp  pI have most of this working, using a custom java function that does linebyline comparison  except that it fails in one particular use case, namely that when the old version contains a particular text emmore than onceem, and the nonlast of them is changed in the new version. This would trick the comparator into matching the oldversion text with the emfollowingem newversion text, instead of recognising the onetext change for what it is. Although the result is emtechnicallyem correct, the added noise of unnecessary additions and removals mask this fact, and for humans its plainly a mess to look at and, incidentally, this markup is intended emforem human readability. Now, exactly because of my linebyline approach, I find this very difficult to fix.p  pHeres an example of a use case that tricks my code. First, a simple fruit basketp  precodeltdocument diff revision1gt   lttext diff revision1gtAppleslttextgt   lttext diff revision1gtOrangeslttextgt   lttext diff revision1gtAppleslttextgt   lttext diff revision1gtCherrieslttextgt   lttext diff revision1gtAppleslttextgt ltdocumentgt codepre  pNow, lets alter the 2nd Apples itemp  precodeltdocumentgt   lttextgtAppleslttextgt   lttextgtOrangeslttextgt   lttextgtBananaslttextgt   lt Ive only changed this   lttextgtCherrieslttextgt   lttextgtAppleslttextgt   lttextgtGrapeslttextgt ltdocumentgt codepre  pThe result, incorrectly, becomesp  precodeltdocument diff revision2gt   lttext diff revision1gtAppleslttextgt   lttext diff revision1gtOrangeslttextgt   lttext diff revision2gtBananaslttextgt   lt Addition, okay   lttext diff revision2gtCherrieslttextgt   lt Incorrectly added   lttext diff revision1gtAppleslttextgt   lt Incorrectly matches the next occurrence   lttext diff revision2gtCherrieslttextgt   lt Incorrectly removed   lttext diff revision2gtAppleslttextgt   lt Incorrectly removed   lttext diff revision1gtGrapeslttextgt   lt Back on track, after the next occurrence of the changed element ltdocumentgt codepre  pTrue, I could probably alleviate this issue but implementing some form of lookahead, but I wouldnt be able to tell how far to look ahead, and it therefore sounds like a very messy workaround rather than a true solution.p  p...so in closing, Im desperate for an xml diff tool that allows me to analyse the data content and create this very particular output. Either that, or any tips to how I could avoid this particular pitfall.p  pIf you have any suggestions, or questions for elaboration, Im very eager to hear from you.p  hr  pThis is a restatement of a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5508954customxmlfilecomparisonprevious questiona. Unfortunately, Im not able to offer any bounties to advertise it, but hopefully my new explanation here will fare better.p  hr  pFor what its worth, heres my algorithm, which does emnotem seem to be listed on the a hrefhttpc2.comcgiwikiDiffAlgorithm relnofollowDiffAlgorithma page that LarsH linked top  pCompare two lists call them lL and lR for the left and righthand sides. Create two primary pointers iL and iR and set them to the first elements of each list. For the loop, use these primary pointers to set primary elements eL and eR, so that eLlLiL and eRlRiR. Compare eL and eR. If eL matches eR, we can copy eL to the result as a match and advance both primary pointers by one slot. If eL and eR do not match, create a secondary pointer iR2, initialise it to the slot after iR iR2iR1 and scan the remainder of lR setting eR2lRiR2 as we go. If eL is not matched in the remainder of lR, eL must have been deleted, and we can add eL to the result as a deletion and advance only the primary pointer iL so that the next comparison will compare the next eL with the same eR. If eL is found to match eR2 at position iR2iR, then all elements in the range [iR,iR2[ must have been added. We can then add each element in that range of lR to the result as an addition, and set iRiR2. We can also add the element eL to the result as a match because it was matched at eR2, and finally repeat the comparison at the new primary pointer positions. Do all this while iterating over the shorter of the two lists then, add the remainder of lL as deletions or add the remainder of lR as additions.p

Negative 64108 pI am facing a problem on getting a solution on Ordering of Columns. I have used many 3rd party libraries like danvk library,jqGrid for dragging the columns. But what i want to do is. I have a div and have five fields in it. FirstNJame,LastName,Address,Phone,Designation also having up and down button so that i can move the fields up and down. On the Ok button, I want to have my table order according the order of fields which i have set on that div. so in short, change in thead and tbody, of what kind of order has been set in that div. Ihave programmed up and down, back and forward. I just need a solution to move the column position in javascript or in jquery. Thanks.p
Negative 64108 pI have a series of methods being called for my networking code. An event gets fired from the networking thread. Inside this event, which Ive hooked into from a singleton class, I route messages to form level methods which they register on form load to handle certain messages they care about. Inside of these form message hooks I need to close the current form which I was able to do but also show a different one which is giving me the trouble.p  pThe new form sort of shows but its hangingnot updating. Im sure this has something to do with that form because its .Show was basically called from another thread sort of doesnt have a message loop, but Im not sure how else to solve this. The network message that gets received indicates on the client machine what forms to close and show.p  pThe flow might be confusing so Ill try better to explain.p  pLogin form attaches user defined functions inside that form to a singleton class list of messages. For example when a message called LOGINSTATUS is fired I assign a function from the Login form to a list defined in this singleton class.p  pThe singleton class has the network class defined in it which actually runs on another thread, but this is all handled inside the class. In the private ctor I subscribe to the OnData event of this network class.p  pWhen OnData gets fired from the network class to the singleton class it passes to it the type of data. I loop through the list of function pointers to see if any of them are linked to LOGINSTATUS and if so call them. This will call the Login forms function. Inside that function I need to close the Login form and open the Lobby form. Thats when the Lobby form shows, but is hung up and not updating.p  pHope that makes sense.p  pThis is all being done in VB.NET where I have the close when last form closed setting on which is what I want. VB.NET also makes it easier to manage forms since I can just for formname.Show instead of having to keep a list of the forms and manage them myself like in C so if thats still possible with the solution that would be ideal.p
Negative 64108 pI have a table which consists of 2 foreign keys. And those are only elements of the table. The table is meant to create association between 2 other tables.

Negative 64108 pIn an app I am working on, I use reflection to dynamically load animation assemblies and create instances from them. However, when I am done with the animation, I dispose of the wrapper on the animation and forget about it . . . which works until I need the animation again.p  pCreating the animation calls codeAssembly.CreateInstanceAnimationUnit.TypeNamecode to dynamically create an instance from the animation assembly, since each assembly is a uniquely named dll file. Is the Silverlight Runtime smart enough to only load the assembly once, even if I make this call multiple timesp

Negative 64108 pI am using this DataBaseHelper.class and I am stuck on the onUpgrademethod. I do not know how to figure out what the version number of the database is. I could set the version to 1, the first time i publish it and when I publish an update I simply could set the version to 2 codemyDataBase.setVersion2code.

Negative 64108 pIve got an app that, in some situation I cant reproduce, locks up both Firefox and Chrome.  I have no insight into whats causing the problem.  I cant get any information because both browsers just lock up  even firebug and Chromes developer tools freeze.

Negative 64108 pI am trying to refactor my code to make reuse existing code but wanted some suggestions as to how this should be done in the best possible way using REST resources Jersey in this case.p  pI have a resource that deals with Domains. Such methods in this resource include getting a domain, getting multiple domains, and posting for bulk gets too many to use a GET.p  pHowever, I also have a resouce that does the same for URLs. Except that what I do here is to extract the domains from the URL and effectively perform the same logic that I do with the DomainResource class as once I have the domain from the URL, I need to execute the exact same lookups. However instead of reusing the existing DomainResource methods, I am duplicating and calling the same methods in my URLResouce class.p  pSo is it better to have duplication in this case and keep the resources separate, or is it possible badgood preactice to call one resource from another, in the case, the URLResouce would delegate to the DomainResource How does this soundp

Negative 64108 pIm a designer not a programmer and after days of googling I have to turn here for help. Im sure this is fairly simple for a programmer. What I need is a code that lets users select checkboxes to set cookies that will display corresponding images on the page.p  pFor example a checkbox form with options [a] [b] [c], if a user selects boxes [a] and [c] then a cookie will be set and display somewhere on the page p  pcodeltimg srca.gifgt ltimg srcc.gifgtcodep  pIf the user goes back to the form and selects different options then other images will be displayed.

Negative 64108 pI have a rather large site where the site builders have all of the internal paths automatically set to lowercase in the pages themselves, menus, etc..

This is a problem as its a high visibility site with a lot of external links to the old URLs. p  pThe sitebuilders also attempted to manually enter a redirect of codeAlzheimerscode  codealzheimerscode and, of course, this created an infinite redirect loop, black hole, zombie war, etc.p  pI attempted to handle this with apache modspeling, with no success, though I dont have extensive experience with this mod. I am wondering if I am possibly missing something  does it need specific rule for capitalization changes The instructions I followed had me enable the mod and restart Apache. It didnt help.p  pSo Im wondering if I need to hook into the theme codehookinitcode to grab the requested URL and throw in a little PHP to just set the string to lower. Any ideas I dont have any problems coding it, but if there is a simpler way to handle this, any help would be tremendously appreciated. p  pBeing as this would be a typical issue for any site written for Windows and transferred to Drupal or LAMP in general, I cant possibly be the first person to need a fix for this.  p  pIf custom Drupal code is needed, where is best to hook it in for something like thisp

Also not shown, there are several events and these queries can also be filtered by eventID. Also, not all questions have a correct answer at the time theyre answered.

Negative 64108 pI work on a php website that deploys to our servers with capistrano.  The site has a very large media folder that needs to be moved into the current deploy every time.  Currently what happens is I have a shell script that does a mount bind every time it deploys.  And on the before deploy it does an unmount of that folder.  The problem is that it isnt reliable and sometimes on cleanup it rms my media folder.  I thought about putting the media folder in the github, but it is 500 mbs and needs to change as users create accounts. p  pSo options I have thought of and want your opinions on, or your options that is better then I can think of.p  ol liAn .htaccess rewrite that whenever it looks for the media folder it reroutes it to a subdomain that has the folder on it.  I just dont know if this rewrite will work for creating files and directories or only reading them. ul liI tested this today and it worked, for reading from the subdomain, but I could not get the create or write to workli ulli lipFind a beter way to deploy the media folder without having to rely on shell commands that seem to fail and destroy the folderpli lipRestarting the server on every deploy this unmounts all folders then just do the mount after the deploy and server restarted.  This is just time consuming if I am doing many deploys it wouldnt work well because I have staging and production on the same server, so if I am testing on staging, restart it, it also restarts my production site, thus unmounting production well I am on staging testing.pli ol  pThose are the only options I could think of.

Negative 64108 pI know how function comparison works in Python 3 just comparing address in memory, and I understand why.p  pI also understand that true comparison do functions codefcode and codegcode return the same result given the same arguments, for any arguments is practically impossible.p  pI am looking for something in between. I want the comparison to work on the simplest cases of identical functions, and possibly some less trivial onesp  precodelambda x  x  lambda x  x  True lambda x  2  x  lambda y  2  y  True lambda x  2  x  lambda x  x  2  True or False is fine, but must be stable lambda x  2  x  lambda x  x  x  True or False is fine, but must be stable codepre  pNote that Im interested in solving this problem for anonymous functions codelambdacode, but wouldnt mind if the solution also works for named functions.p  pThe motivation for this is that inside codeblistcode module, it would be nice to verify that two codesortedsetcode instances have the same sort function before performing a union, etc. on them. p  pNamed functions are of less interest because I can assume them to be different when they are not identical. After all, suppose someone created two sortedsets with a named function in the codekeycode argument. If they intend these instances to be compatible for the purposes of set operations, theyd probably use the same function, rather than two separate named functions that perform identical operations.p  pI can only think of three approaches. All of them seem hard, so any ideas appreciated. p  ol lipComparing bytecodes might work but it might be annoying that its implementation dependent and hence the code that worked on one Python breaks on another.pli lipComparing tokenized source code seems reasonable and portable. Of course, its less powerful since identical functions are more likely to be rejected.pli lipA solid heuristic borrowed from some symbolic computation textbook is theoretically the best approach. It might seem too heavy for my purpose, but it actually could be a good fit since lambda functions are usually tiny and so it would run fast.pli ol  pEDITp  pA more complicated example, based on the comment by delnanp  precode global variable fields  [id, name]  def myfunction   global fields   s1  sortedsetkey  lambda x  x[fields[0].lower]    some intervening code here    ...   s2  sortedsetkey  lambda x  x[fields[0].lower] codepre  pWould I expect the key functions for codes1code and codes2code to evaluate as equalp  pIf the intervening code contains any function call at all, the value of codefieldscode may be modified, resulting in different key functions for codes1code and codes2code. Since we clearly wont be doing control flow analysis to solve this problem, its clear that we have to evaluate these two lambda functions as different, if we are trying to perform this evaluation before runtime. Even if codefieldscode wasnt global, it might have been had another name bound to it, etc. This would severely curtail the usefulness of this whole exercise, since few lambda functions would have no dependence on the environment.p  pEDIT 2p  pI realized its very important to compare the function objects as they exist in runtime. Without that, all the functions that depend on variables from outer scope cannot be compared and most useful functions do have such dependencies. Considered in runtime, all functions with the same signature are comparable in a clean, logical way, regardless of what they depend on, whether they are impure, etc.p  pAs a result, I need not just the bytecode but also the global state as of the time the function object was created presumably codeglobalscode. Then I have to match all variables from outer scope to the values from codeglobalscode.p

Negative 64108 pI am getting the following error when I am trying to use the library during runtime java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError com.google.api.client.extensions.android2.AndroidHttp I have added this library to my project, it is the first jar of the Maven dependencies I am not 100 used to Maven though.p  pAlso,My understanding is that Ant is looking for the jars in a libs folder, but Maven is using its own folder, and that works fine for an other project. So I am lost..any clueshelp on how should I troubleshoot this would be much appreciatedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5oEfV.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNGamn.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlm1hg.png altenter image description herep
Negative 64108 pDelegate  I understand. But when I move to event, many things I dont understand so much. I read book, MSDN and some simple examples on Network, they both have same structures. For example, here is the link  a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comArticles11541TheSimplestCEventsExampleImaginable relnofollowEvent Examplea p  pI take the first example, that the author said its the most easiest example about C Event.p  pHere is his code  p  precodepublic class Metronome      public event TickHandler Tick     public EventArgs e  null     public delegate void TickHandlerMetronome m, EventArgs e     public void Start              while true                      System.Threading.Thread.Sleep3000             if Tick  null                              Tickthis, e                              public class Listener      public void SubscribeMetronome m              m.Tick  new Metronome.TickHandlerHeardIt          private void HeardItMetronome m, EventArgs e              System.Console.WriteLineHEARD IT        class Test      static void Main              Metronome m  new Metronome         Listener l  new Listener         l.Subscribem         m.Start       codepre  pYou can notice line codepublic event TickHandler Tickcode. When I change to codepublic TickHandler Tickcode, program still run the same. But new line I understand because its just a pure delegate. p  pSo, my question is  what is the real purpose of codeeventcode keyword in line  codepublic event TickHandler Tickcode. This is very important, because all examples always use like this, but I cannot explain why.p  pThanks p

Negative 64108 pI am using Selenium2WebDriver to test my web applications. All the tests are written in Java and run with Maven.p  pWhile opening a page with webdriver Id like to capture all the requests made by page images, js and css files, etc. I use this data mainly for two reasonsp  ul lichecking for 404 and other errors in callsli lichecking if analytics code is working checking if its sending proper requestsli ul  pDepending on the project I use either Firebug with Netexport or Browsermob proxy. In both cases I can easily obtain a HAR Html ARchive file, parse it and extract the data I want.p  pHeres the problem I am not happy with neither of these solutions. I have especially problems with getting HAR file when a page contains video that is being loaded too long. I am looking for something more stable.p  pSo, the questions arep  pIs there any alternative to Browsermob I know about FiddlerCore but its a .NET library and my tests are written in Java. Ive also heard about Ajax DynaTrace and I know that there is some way to integrate it with Selenium but the documentation I found was for SeleniumRC not WebDriver.p  pIs there any way to integrate DynaTrace with WebDriver or use FiddlerCore with Javap  pIs there any other way to achieve the goals I mentioned I am looking for a proxy that I can easily control from my code. Exporting data to HAR would be a great plus.p

Negative 64108 pI have many different nodes connected with relationships. On those relationships, I use some properties of type Enum, and I am trying to query through the relationships using the Cyper language and only return those who have the Enum property being in an array. Also, the relationship I am trying to query against is a subclass of another one which has the property I want to query with. Heres an examplep  precodeRelationshipEntity public class Mother       IndexedlevelLevel.INSTANCE Visibility visibility     public Visibility getVisibility          return visibility          public void setVisibilityVisibility visibility          this.visibility  visibility        public class Child extends Mother      StartNode StartNode start     EndNode EndNode end  codepre  pImagine that the visibility is an enum that can be either Private, Network or Public.

Using the IN operator is a bonusp  pEdit 1 I am using springdataneo4j 2.0.1.RELEASE. I am trying to do this in Unit testing, using codeorg.neo4j.test.ImpermanentGraphDatabasecode, but I just realised that the query codeQuerystart snode0 match s[rTYPE]gte where r.visibilityPrivate return rcode works when running the server, using the default configuration, but it still doesnt work in unit testing. Also, even when running the server, the IN clause still throws an error. Is this related to the version I am using I remember trying to use a more recent version but then dependencies failed, maybe I should try again.p  pEdit 2 So I updated the version of springdataneo4j to 2.1.0.BUILDSNAPSHOT, upgraded neo4j version to 1.7 also. Now I dont have an error for the IN keyword, but I dont know what syntax should I use to pass along the values to search against. So havingp  precodeQuerystart snode0 match s[rTYPE]gte where r.visibility in [1] return r IterableltChildgt findChildrenStartNode start, String visibility codepre  pworks if I pass along a simple String like codePubliccode, but not if I pass along codePublic, Privatecode which never returns anything, even though codePubliccode does return matches.

Negative 64108 pI am fairly new to excel vba and I cant seem to fix this problem with vbArrays. I created the function cumsum in vba just to make my life easier. However, I want to make the code flexible such that I can pass in both variants from a function and also a range. In my code, when I added the line vecvec.value if I am passing in a range, it works perfectly fine but it doesnt work if I want it to work if I call the function and pass in a non range type.

Negative 64108 pI am trying to send UDP over a network to a microcontroller. The microcontroller has had almost all of the IP stack stripped out to keep it lean, so cannot engague in ARP. The microcontroller is outputting broadcast packets, which I can receive so I know its IP address and MAC address.  I can send broadcast UDP packets to it, which it receives fine, but when I try to send packets using its IP address, I can see ARP messages in wireshark, Who has 192.168.1.205 Tell 192.168.1.18, 205 being the micro, 18 is my PC. The micro does not respond with its MAC address, so I cant send the packet, but I know the MAC address from the packets the micro is sending out anyway.p  pSo my question is can I specify the IP and MAC address using the UdpClient so it does not need to use ARP.. is there anything else Im not consideringp  pThe broadcast method that works looks like thisp  precodemyUdpClient.EnableBroadcast  true myUdpClient.ConnectIPAddress.Broadcast, port myUdpClient.SenddataBytes, dataBytes.Length codepre  pThe fixed IP method that doesnt currently work looks like thisp  precodeIPEndPoint ep  new IPEndPoint192.168.1.205, port myUdpClient.SenddataBytes, dataBytes.Length, ep codepre  pI have looked at using things likep  precodemyUdpClient.Client.SendTodataBytes, SocketFlags.DontRoute, ep codepre  pbut this doesnt work, and is still not making use of the microcontrollers MAC address.. which my application knows and needs to use I think. I was also hoping some ARP table on the network would have known where the MAC address was seeing as packets with this info are being sent from it.. p  pAs a note, I want to keep broadcast to a minimum to reduce the load on other microcontrollers on the network. p  pThanks in advance,  Garethp

Negative 64108 pMy goal is to develop a crossplattform based application in C and OpenGL.p  pSince I am using a Macbook Pro, its natural IDE is Xcode, so I would like to use it. Ive successfully compiled pure C code in Xcode, by using the Command Line tool as a template for the projects.p  pMy question is how can I compile OpenGL code without messing with Cocoa and ObjectiveC. The main reason behind this is that since I want to deploy crossplattform applications, I want to stick to C as much as possible.p  pWhile this is true, It wouldnt be that much of a problem if I necessary had to use a little of ObjectiveC and Cocoa. But I would like to get my main project code in C and the less possible amount of ObjectiveCCocoa, understanding by main project code the code specific to my application, such as my classes, objects, and stuff related to the aim of the application, ie. , the main body of the code.p  pIf using COpenGL without messing with ObjCCocoa is not worth in terms of complexity, then the question could be reformulated as simply what is the way to compile simple OpenGL code in Xcodep

Negative 64108 pSome architectures have a prefetch write instruction to indicate to the CPU that youre going to be writing to a memory location before you actually do it. I understand that on a multicore machine this can be used by the core as a hint that it should try to get ownership of the given cache line now so that it can write to the location more quickly later. However, AFAICT that should only matter in situations when there are two cores potentially contending for the cache line.

Negative 64108 pI need to render an arbitrarily large codeNSAttributedStringcode, in this case ANSIcolored text from an arbitrarily long telnet session. The text need not be editable inline. I have explored a few optionsp  ul licodeUITextViewcode seems to have by far the best performance and, since Im targeting iOS 6, its very easy to use with attributed strings. However, the textview gets progressively slower to render as more text is added, as it hits an HTML DOM parser each time I call codesetAttributedStringcode and blocks the UI. li liIve tried a few core text rendering frameworks, codeTTTAttributedLabelcode and codeOHAttributedLabelcode, that also get progressively slower with more text. To be fair, theyre labels probably not intended for this sort of thingli licodeUIWebViewcode emgagem has some issues with rotation and keeping the text properly sized and framed, but I think I could work around it. I can convert my attributed string to HTML and use JavaScript to append inject new text as it is received. Surprisingly good performance here. li liA friend suggested I think of the users current scroll position as a viewport into a larger document and probably with core text render only the visible part of my attributed string. Im worried about how this might impact scrolling performance. li ul  pSo I turn to you, brave interwebs. Ideas for an indie developer Is a webview my best betp

Negative 64108 pI saw a project, in which they are doing a Dynamic build script in php that will build static html pages out of php pages. That is the html file will look exactly like the php file.

Same with JS unit test scripts.p  pMy Question is, is there any specific PHP framework to achieve this functionality i.e Build architecture, php to html conversion etc...

Negative 64108 pFrom the Ruby on Rails documentationp  blockquote   pThe first feature of the pipeline is to concatenate assets. This is   important in a production environment, because it can reduce the   number of requests that a browser must make to render a web page. Web   browsers are limited in the number of requests that they can make in   parallel, so fewer requests can mean faster loading for your   application.p blockquote  pThis is widely considered a best practice around the web. But doesnt conventional logic tell us that loading even three files in parallel is faster than loading a concatenated version serially. So even if there is an upper limit on the number of parallel connections, it should be faster than waiting for one huge file on a single connection. Or does it have to do with the overhead for each requestp

Negative 64108 pIm using Netbeans to automatically create webservice clients based off WSDL files. This works well, except the webservices Im using require that I pass in a custom cookie in the HTTP header to every webservice in order to prove my identity. p  pI use one webservice named codeUtilitycode to get my authorization. This sets a cookie which needs to be provided in all subsequent calls to any webservice.p  pThis can be accomplished by setting codejavax.xml.ws.session.maintaincode to codetruecode on the BindingProvider of the port for the webservice. This works great for subsequent calls to the methods in the codeUtilitycode webservice. The problem is that this only maintains the sessioncookie for that single webservice.

Negative 64108 pGood evening people. I have this Django question.. I have a view that renders a form with a header information from a masterdetail like models. Below this form, I want to load another view that renders a form that fills the detail table and next to it, the list with the detail. I want to load inside the template of the header view, the details view but I want to do it without ajax. I was reading the  include  tag but, from what I understand, it loads a template, not a view. I might be wrong, is there a way to load a view inside the masters templatep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 64108 pIm working on an application and have a little problem right now. Let me explain what is the purpose of this applicationbr  there is a main menu with different buttons lets say 16 buttons.   each time the user clicks on a button, it sends a request to a database and display a listview of results with different results depending on the button you clicked.br  in the database, there is a column with a category number. actually there are 3 columns with CatNumbers but lets keep it simple.br  the request asks to display all the elements where this category number equals some values these are the inputs of my method, called myVariableN sent from the MainActivity to the ListView activity via putExtragetExtra.  In my ListViewActivity which displays the results  p  precodeprivate void displayListView      Bundle bundle  getIntent.getExtras     String title  bundle.getStringtitle, Choose here      int myVariable1  bundle.getIntmyVariable1, 500     int myVariable2  bundle.getIntmyVariable2, 500     int myVariable3  bundle.getIntmyVariable3, 500     int myVariable4  bundle.getIntmyVariable4, 500     int myVariable5  bundle.getIntmyVariable5, 500     int myVariable6  bundle.getIntmyVariable6, 500 codepre  pSo what I have so far is this  if you click on button 1 for example, it sends 6 variables myVariable1, 2, 3 ... 6 and ask to display all elements WHERE CatNumber IN myVariable1, myVariable2, ... myVariable6.    p  precodepublic Cursor findPoiInTableint myVariable1, int myVariable2,         int myVariable3, int myVariable4, int myVariable5, int myVariable6       String inInterval  ,,,,,     String where  COLCAT1   IN   inInterval   OR   COLCAT2               IN   inInterval   OR   COLCAT3   IN   inInterval     String[] whereArgs  new String[3  6]      for int i  0 i lt 3 i               whereArgs[6  i]  Integer.toStringmyVariable1         whereArgs[6  i  1]  Integer.toStringmyVariable2         whereArgs[6  i  2]  Integer.toStringmyVariable3         whereArgs[6  i  3]  Integer.toStringmyVariable4         whereArgs[6  i  4]  Integer.toStringmyVariable5         whereArgs[6  i  5]  Integer.toStringmyVariable6          Cursor c  myDatabase.queryDATABASETABLE, new String[]  KEYROWID,             COLNAME, COLSTREET, where, whereArgs, null, null, null    return c    codepre  pProblem is, out of these 16 buttons from the main menu, there are a few buttons which would require to get data from the database with a much bigger range of category numbers. For example, something like SELECT .... FROM.... WHERE CatNumber IN myVariable1, myVariable2, ..... myVariableem50em.br And unfortunately, the method must be the same for every button, no matter if there are 2 or 50 input variables.    p  pI feel like if I do this, my method is gonna be too heavy and will slow down my whole application, because in most of the cases, even when the request will be supposed to find 2 or 3 CatNumbers, the method will be defined for 50 inputs or more so it will have to make the whole calculation every time.     p  pWhat I was thinking about wasbr strongastrong Modifying my method with a IF statement, so for example, IF there are less than... lets say 6 variables sent, it will make the light method with only 6 myVariable input, ELSE, its gonna run the heavy method with 50 inputs. So the heavy method will be used only in a few cases, the wrong thing is that even if there are only 7 inputs, it will run the heavy method. Or in the same kind of idea, I could send a boolean sent via putExtra and set to TRUE for using the light method and FALSE and then it would use the heavy method.br strongbstrong Set the value by default to 500 as done in my code, so only the specific myVariables have a value different than 500. And then my question is strongis it possible to define a method with 50 inputs and to make it only use the input whose value is different from a certain number, so the method isnt always too heavy to runstrong  For example in the code above with the method, would it be possible to say to only look for two variables if the four other are equal to 500 myVariable1 and myVariable2 instead of all the variables even if the whole method is defined for the rest.br Thanks in advance p

Fast web services can be called by an xml ajax bound grid, with server filters that limit the returned xml. Slow web services can be called outside of the grid which is later pointed to and xmlstring cached by the client. Data filters, in the later scenario, become client xmlreader dynamic filters applied to the xmlreader.row level.p  pemstrongINITIAL QUESTIONemstrongp  pMy scenario is thisp  ul liTwo jqgrids, one master, one detailli liInitially fed from fast web service ajax call, datatype xml, with xmlreader like this for the detail gridli ul  pcodeid  rowid,br repeatitems  false,br root  responsegtclaimsgtclaimgtunits,br row  unitcodep  ul liSwitch the same grids to disconnected mode, data type xmlstring basically, client stored xmlstring variable received from web service that takes too long to do multiple ajax callsli liWhen master grid row is clicked, I build dynamically a filter to filter down the detail gridli liBoth grids are fed now, in disconnected xmlstring mode, from copies of the client stored xmlstring javascript variableli ul  pFrom my prior experience with subgrids, I know you can filter the xmlstring grids by applying a selector to the xmlreader root section. So, I attempted first the following dynamic xmlreader complete xmlstring data sample at the bottomp  precodeid  rowid, repeatitems  false, root  responsegtclaimsgtclaimgtunitshasclaimIdcontains6002950,unitIdcontains6003434, row  unit codepre  pThis didnt work, both rows came back and shown in the detail grid.  At this point I looked back at my subgrid example, and saw that there I was going one level deeper with the filter. So I tried a deeper root filterp  precodeid  rowid, repeatitems  false, root  responsegtclaimsgtclaimgtunitsgtunithasclaimIdcontains6002950,unitIdcontains6003434, row  unit codepre  pThis didnt work, either. First, the has filter seems to not work even if I went deeper. Something must be wrong with this chained contains filter. Moreso, now the xmlreader row section didnt make sense anymore to be unit.p  pAt this point, I had spent too much time with the xmlreader selector, and I was thinking to try removing the xml nodes that dont match the filter and leave the xmlreader filterless. Tried a negative match filter on the selector I was trying in the root, by applying not to it.p

Negative 64108 pI would like to implement an activity with 2 fragments in tablet app. Fragment A on left and second fragment B with some additional info on the right. Lets say each fragment has half of the screen width. Now I would like to add the option to slide the right fragment B to the right side of screen and let the fragment only e.g. 10  of width so fragment A can expand to 90.p  pSo fragment A now can has more space and fragment B can be slided to the middle back again. I would like to ask if there is a library that can help me or if there is already functional solution of this.p  pI have never worked with SlidingDrawer that seems to be right but now it is deprecated.p
Negative 64108 pI have an image with CLFLOAT format and stores all RGBA channels. Now every 4th pixel of image has integers stored there, I store them clasically asp  precodeimage[i  4  3].x  floatampsomeInt image[i  4  3].y  floatampsomeInt2 etc. codepre  pAnd as I need these to be integers and not floats, the rest of the pixels have to store floats, so I dont have much options here.p  pWhen I read image back from OpenCL I get the values correctly, the problem arises in OpenCL kernelp  pWhenever I read image like this sampler is set just to nearest filteringp  precodefloat4 fourthPixel  readimagefimg, sampler, coords codepre  pAnd I try to convert it to integer asp  precodeint id  asintfourthPixel.x codepre  pI dont read correct number it always returns 0, unless number is quite high in integer form.p  pI got few points so far  if I store number like 1505353234 it WORKS, giving me back 6539629947781120.000000  which is correct. If I store smaller numbers, it seems that readimagef just clamps then down to 0.p  pSo its quite obvious, that ALL denormalized numbers are clamped down to zero. So, is there any good way to actually force readimagef to not clamp down denormalized numbers to zero, without adding further instruction ye i could add 0x7f000000 or such  but I need performance in the code, so this solution is unacceptablep

Am i right. and Can we convert the codeTypecode of a codevariablecode at any point. [say, we are using a codevariablecode x inside the codescriptcode for our doing calculations Ex x  10  5, later on meaning after 5 lines of codecodecode can we use the same codeinteger variablecode for codeString manipulationscode.] I am little bit confused at this moment.p  pI am learning codeJScode [Migrating from codeVB.Netcode]p

Negative 64108 pI am using Python and I have a swig interface to a c program. This program is a scientific application that also handles a database. We use it to fetch and save data, but the problem is that it does not support parallel calls.

What I had in mind is wrapping this module some way that the functions would only run one at a time, so I can actually use more threads on the number crunching part of the program without having to worry about having two or more functions of this module being executed at the same time.p

Negative 64108 pAlright, I have a really troubling CUDA 5.0 question about how to link things properly. Id be really grateful for any assistancep  pUsing the separable compilation features of CUDA 5.0, I generated a static library .a. This nicely links with other .cu files when run through nvcc, I have done this many times.p  pId now like to take a .cpp file and link it against the host code in this static library using g or whatever, but not nvcc. If I attempt this, I get compiler errors like p  blockquote   pundefined reference to cudaRegisterLinkedBinaryp blockquote  pIm using both codelcudacode and codelcudartcode and, to my knowledge, have the libraries in the correct order meaning codelmylib lcuda lcudartcode.

Maybe Im wrong, but I feel Im missing a step and that I need to do something else to my static library device linking before I can use it with g.p  pHave I missed something crucial Is this even possiblep  pBonus question I want the end result to be a dynamic library. How can I achieve thisp

Negative 64108 pI have a pointset representing a set of polygons which I pass to a polygon boolop clipping algorithm.

So if A is the pointset before the operation and B is the pointset after the operation, I want to know which points are in B but not in A.p  pShould I use an ordinary set type like C stdset with an appropriate comparison defined and then do a difference, or would it be best to implement a quadtree and then do a difference Do such opensource quadtree implementations exist which provide differencing I googled for quadtree but most seem to relate to nearestneighbour problems which are not relevant for my requirements.p  pI would be having a maximum of 1000 points per operation.p  pThank youp

Negative 64108 pI want to model linguistic syntax trees in my database. In my design, a syntax tree consists of inner nodes and terminal nodes both types of nodes are weak entity types that are identified by the syntax tree they belong to. Syntax trees themselves are also weak entities they are identified by the sentence whose syntactic structure they are to represent. A given sentence may have more than one syntax tree. A terminal node can be associated 1mrelation with a token from the sentence its syntax tree is identified by. Tokens, too, are weak entities that are identified by the sentence they belong to. p  pSo overall, after translating my ER diagram into relation schemas some of my relation schemas look like this simplifiedp  blockquote   psentencesentenceIDp      psyntaxTreesentenceID, treeDiscrp      ptokensentenceID, tokenDiscrp      pterminalNodesentenceIDFromTree, treeDiscr, nodeID, sentenceIDFromToken, tokenDiscrp blockquote  pAs you can see, the relation schema of terminalNode contains two foreign keys that each reference a sentenceID One holds the ID of the sentence the syntax tree represents, and one holds the ID of the sentence the token belongs to. Of course, the values of these sentenceIDs always need to be the same. Thus, for terminalNode the following two functional dependencies holdp  blockquote   psentenceIDFromTree  sentenceIDFromTokenp      psentenceIDFromToken sentenceIDFromTreep blockquote  pFor neither of these dependencies does the right side correspond to a subset of the left side, i.e. they are not trivial nor does their left side correspond to a superkey  i.e. the relation schema is not in BCNF. In order to make the relation schema be in BCNF, I thought that I could merge sentenceIDFromTree and sentenceIDFromToken into one attribute after all, the two attributes always need to have the same values anyway. As far as I understand, in SQL I cannot make one foreign key reference several tables at the same time directly, so I would probably have to work with some additional triggers to make sure that both the syntaxTree and the token table get referenced by the single sentenceID.  As I do not have much experience with database design and have admittedly no idea what is considered good DB design, I wonder now whether I should really merge the two foreign keys, or leave my design as it is or maybe there are further ways to deal with this. Additionally, I fear that the whole problem might indicate that there is something really wrong about my conceptual design, but I have no idea how I could model this scenario differently. Any help will be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 64108 pstrongThings are working, and I dont know why. This scares me.strong p  pI recently asked another a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17715912unabletogetresponsesfromlocalserverwhenconnectingviaiosdevicequestion on stackoverflowa that had me confused for many hours. You can read the long description of the problem there, but Ill describe the gist of itp  pI have a simple iOS project that asks for JSON data from a simple rails server. The requests work fine if I am running the project from the simulator, but kept failing when I ran it from my device.p  pI quickly discovered my first problem, using localhost as the base url for my AFNetworking client, and started using my IP address instead which allowed me to communicate with the server. p  pWhen making my GET requests, I could see that the request was hitting the server by watching my terminal window and that the server was returning a 200 response which should include the JSON representation of the items requested. However emthe AFNetworking getPathparameterssuccessfailure method was failing every time.em I could inspect the response and see that it was of type 200, and if I simulated a failed request such as 422 with a JSON error, I could see the error messages. p  pA a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma17728531827441response to my questiona said that the JSON returned may not be valid which could be causing the request to fail. p  pNow the weird partp  pI stumbled around for hours and found a hrefhttpnsscreencast.comepisodes41authenticationwithafnetworking relnofollowa projecta that used a rails server to retrieve a JSON response using AFNetworking. I compared it to my project and the two are essentially the same when it comes to AFNetworking. I then inspected the rails server. Here is the kicker the only difference I could find was the use of the Thin gem. I installed the gem and now my requests are completing successfully and I am getting back the JSON data.p  pCan anyone provide any insight as to why using Thin rather than WEBrick for my Rails server cause JSON data to be passed back to my device successfullyp

Negative 64108 pInternally HashMap has method emhashem which defends against poorly written hashcode by applying special function.  Next step is that returned value by emhashem method is used to calculate index at which new Entry is stored inside backing array called emtableem. It can happen that emindexem is the same for two different keys. For that linked list is used but it is clear to me.p  pstrongWhy can index of backing table be the same for two different keysstrongp  pI know that hashcode can be poorly overriden but method emhashem states that it protects from hashcode collisions.

Dunkan Jones resize is done automatically when amount of elements you put into HashMap emsizeem is more or equal to threshholdcalculated according to initialCapacity and loadFactor provided in constructor.

Negative 64108 pI am planning to write an electric circuit simulator in the Racket language.br To do this I would have to save the initial electrical state of the whole circuit in any form a list in case of Racket, and repeatedly pass this value in a function until the circuit state gets into a given time.brp  pBut wouldnt this, passing a data into a function repeatedly, grow up in the stack and eventually have an impact on the programs performancebr Ive heard that in case of recursive functions, at compile time the code first expands to the final stage where recursion finishes and then gets evaluated one at a time, from the most deeply nested one.br If the same applies on this situation not only mine but in any program that includes a state machine should I rely on mutable data structures the language rather reluctantly offersbrp  pAfter reading bunch of articles praising FP I am trying to make a switch as well. Looking back to days when I went through these cases drinking mutablestate koolaids like crazy now I feel like a criminal.br If the question is another duplicate or a similar one please give me a link, I would take it happily and shut this one down or can I.p

Negative 64108 pIm creating a simple game using Three.js as the renderer and Physijs for the physics engine, although this question can easily be generalized to games as a whole. p  pIn games, the player often has physicsmovement that seems separate from the physics engine it inhabits. They move with instant acceleration and stop just as instantaneously. Players can fall from a height and collide with other objects or players according to the rules of the physics engine, however. p  pNote that for the purposes of my problem, the player has a camera object which isnt bound by physics, although it can be easily attached to a physical object.p  pWhats the best way to achieve this effect Ive thought of a few solutions, but none seem entirely sufficientp  ol lipNo physical attachment, translate the players camera. This, however, would ignore collisions, bypassing the physics engine. pli lipPhysical attachment, and apply force to the physical object. This, however, involves frictional forces and places the players movement at the mercy of the physics engine. pli ol  pThoughts there was a similar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15822168howtomakeawalkthoughlikefpstpsgameswiththreejsandphysicsengineHow to make a walkthough like FPSTPS games with three.js and physics enginea, although it received no answersp
Negative 64108 pIm currently attempting to draw a 3d representation of euler angles within a 2d image no opengl or 3d graphic windows.  The image output can be similar to as below.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuaT1k.png alteuler anglesp  pEssentially I am looking for research or an algorithm which can take a Rotation Matrix or a set of Euler angles and then output them onto a 2d image, like above.  This will be implemented in a C application that uses OpenCV. It will be used to output annotation information on a OpenCV window based on the state of the object.p  pI think Im over thinking this because I should be able to decompose the unit vectors from a rotation matrix and then extract their x,y components and draw a line in cartesian space from 0,0.

You can assume the image above has the correct cameraviewing angle.p  pAny help would be appreciated.p  pThanks,p  pEDIT The example source code can now be found in my repo.

There is a menu that just loads one of a variety of user controls designed as forms in a single update panel clear controls, load new one, etc. The user does what ever inputs, clicks save, delete, etc.  Within these user controls, there are several databound and intradependant controls, which is the main reason I am loading them into an update panel.  p  pNow, I have had this issue where when the user selects a new menu, and then goes to change the value of a databound control, the control loses its value on only the first postback.  Im quite sure this is due to the clearing of the container that the usercontrol resides in, as I have tried clearing and loading a regular panel, and I would have the exact same issue.  As using IsPostBack does not work in my case, i just created a boolean session variable to perform the same logic between the page and the usercontrol, in terms of databinding. To further test my issue, I changed the application to a multipage app, and the problem disappeared values are retained on postback. p  pSo, to get to my original point, as I see functionality in using mulitples pages i figured that within the single page version, if I just added Server.Transferthedefaultpage.aspx to the code, I would retain the functionality I gained from the multipage approach, while keeping the user on the same page. It works great.  No loss of data, it works just as it should.  Is this in poor taste All user functions and duties are always carried out on a single page, and navigation does nothing for them.p  pI am just worried that essentially refreshing the page is just bad practice or hacky, but it works for the purpose of the application, as well as save having to create 23 dozen pages when it may not be necessary.  Ive read a few threads where someone would do this just to clear results, or something minor, but that is all. p  pIf this is poor practice or even if it is not, would perhaps anyone have a solution to the first time postback value loss I have enableviewstatetrue and viewstatemodeenabled on the master, page, usercontrol, and child controls that are databound.  Thanks in advance for any input.p

Negative 64108 pI just started using jbox2d yesterday in my game and Im currently having some issues and I cant find a way to fix them. I have many static bodies and one dynamic body which is the player and I want to simulate collisions.p  pBasically as soon as the method world.step is called my dynamic body moves out of the original position on both the x and y axis from 18.0 to 19.25 and from 26.0 to 70.76 . I tried to print everything else the position of static bodies and the movement of the dynamic body and its correct.p  pI though it had to do with the gravity which I dont need, but after I set the world and dynamic body to 0.0f, it still gives the same problem. The I figured out the problem is the fixture of my dynamic entity If I remove it the problem doesnt occur anymorep  pAlso the body and the dynamic entity are moving slightly differently in pixels, so I guess my setLinearVelocity method might be wrongp  pHow can I fix this and whats these problemsp  pThis is my code I avoid useless stuffs and I keep only those regarding jbox2dp  pMap class, which contains a map of the game.p  precodefields Code public static final float METERINPIXELS  40.0f private World world ...    constructor Code public Mapint startPosX, int startPosY     world  new Worldnew Vec20,10.0f    ...    called every 33ms Code public void updateint delta     world.step160.0f, 8, 3    player.updatedelta  to update the players movement         ...  codepre  pPhysicsMovingEntity the class used by all the moving entities at the moment its extended only by the playerp  precodefields Code private Body body private float physicsX private float physicsY  constructor  public PhysicsMovingEntityfloat x, float y, World world Code     super.setXx    super.setYy    physicsX  x  Map.METERINPIXELS    physicsY  y  Map.METERINPIXELS    initPhysicalBodyworld    init method  Code public void initPhysicalBodyWorld world     BodyDef bd  new BodyDef    bd.type  BodyType.DYNAMIC    bd.position.setphysicsX, physicsY    bd.gravityScale  0    PolygonShape ps  new PolygonShape    ps.setAsBoxgetFrameSize.width  Map.METERINPIXELS, getFrameSize.height  Map.METERINPIXELS    FixtureDef fd  new FixtureDef    fd.density  1    fd.shape  ps    body  world.createBodybd    [colorFF4000]body.createFixturefd[color]  this toggles the problem    called every 33ms Code public void updateint delta      super.updatedelta    [colorFF4000]body.setLinearVelocitynew Vec2getLastDirection.getX  getSpeed,           getLastDirection.getY  getSpeed[color]  probably giving the second problem  codepre  pI really hope you guys can help me solving this problem.p  pThanks a lotp

Negative 64108 pIm deploying some REST services in an Osgi bundle using Jersey. The services are notated like p  precodePOST Pathadduser ConsumesMediaType.APPLICATIONXML,MediaType.APPLICATIONJSON ProducesMediaType.APPLICATIONXML public Message addUserUser user   ...  codepre  pThe first problem I have is that the service doesnt accept both of the MIME types I put into the Consumes notation but just the first one.p  pThe second and worst is that receive the following exeception when I try to call to the services. I can Consumes textplain and I can Produces applicationxml for example but if I try to Consumes an applicationjson or applicationxml the server throw the exception.p  pThe exception is throwed when I make the call with a wellformed json or xml using a REST client or an ajax call, if the service just receive textplain or doesnt receive anything the response to the client is made correctly in xml so the serializer is working ok when I send POJOs but not receiving them.p  precode javax.servlet.ServletException org.glassfish.jersey.server.ContainerException java.lang.LinkageError loader constraint

Negative 64108 pFirstly I may say that I know there are a lot of resources dealing with the communication between services and activities, I have also read the servicerelated part of the android developer guide. However, Im still not sure about the best approach in my case.p  pWhen it comes to the communication between services and other components like activities, embound servicesem are described as the solution in most cases. But from my unterstanding, the use of a bound service always results in a requestresponsemodel  an activity invokes a method on the service request and gets a return value response. The android dev guide calls this a clientservermodel.p  pIn my scenario, a service generates a list of POJOs on a regular basis, but not exactly predictable lets say every 1.5  2 seconds. Every time this happens, the list should be transferred to an activity in order to display it on the screen. In my opinion, a bound service is not the solution here, since my scenario does not match the requestresponsemodel. In fact, the activity is passive and not really aware of the service. Of course I could use a polling strategy together with a bound service, but imho this is not the best approach in my case.p  pWhat would you recommend I found solutions using a BroadcastReceiver in the activity the service acts as sender, is this the only way or are there any other approaches Or do I have a wrong unterstanding of bound services and they are not limited to requestresponsescenariosp  pstrongeditstrongp  pAs I already mentioned, a new list java.util is generated every 1.52 seconds by the service and should immediately passed to the activity. Such a list contains 2025 POJOs that represent model objects they contain 5 Strings and 3 integers each. Just to give you a feeling of the complexity.p  pIs the BroadcastReceiver adequate for this amount of data and frequencyp

Negative 64108 pI should preface this with saying I come from a JavaAndroid background which has colored my understanding of the word member. That said, Im starting to learn ObjectiveC and I ran across the isMemberOfClass method and the name confuses me.p  pI understand that isMemberOfClass returns a Boolean value that indicates whether the receiver is an instance of a given class. However, I dont understand why it is called isMEMBER when it checks if it is an INSTANCE.p  pIs there something about the language protocol that I dont know that would make sense to name it this Does member mean something different in ObjectiveC than it does in Javap  pThe way I understand the definition of member, it is something a class HAS method or data, rather than something a class IS a type.p  pCan anyone clear this seemingly odd naming convention up for me  Thanks for helping a newbiep

Negative 64108 pHi I wondered if this query was within the remit of SharePoint Server 2013 or if someone can point out something quite obvious that im missing.p  pI wanted to create a Survey and offer different Questions based on the answers to those questions. I have tried building something similar in info path and it doesnt seem to meet my requirements and workflows on surveys are proving to be extremely frustrating.p  pBasically what I need is when someone answers Yes or Maybe to the first question it proceeds to the other questions and records the results in a viewable format this works finep  pHowever when a person answers No to the same question I want it to end the survey saving the results of how many people answered No and offer some sort of message. I only administor the site collection and familiar with but not confident enough to play around with scriptp  pI thought Branching might be my solution but it only offers the option for another question. I had hope in an IF statement after looking at the required syntax but nothing seems to fit.p  pAny help is much appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 64108 pI am trying to find sum of all given numbers in an array. And I have to split the array in equal size and send to each process and calculate the sum. Later send back the calculated sum from each process to root process for final answer. Actually, I know I can use MPIScatter. But my problem is what if my list is in the odd number.

There are two reasons this could occur  1. this process did not call init before exiting, but others in the job did. This can cause a job to hang indefinitely while it waits for all processes to call init. By rule, if one process calls init, then ALL processes must call init prior to termination.  2. this process called init, but exited without calling finalize. By rule, all processes that call init MUST call finalize prior to exiting or it will be considered an abnormal termination  This may have caused other processes in the application to be terminated by signals sent by mpiexec as reported here. codepre  pI know I am doing wrong..

So upon a tripletap, both methods are called.  p  pObviously this isnt an inherent issue with the code or underlying SDK, since its fully expected.  However, Im curious if anyone has a clever way to somehow prevent the doubletap functionality to be called if a tripletap is done  I am assuming I may have to set the doubletap functionality on a delayed timer maybe which would wait a split second to confirm whether a tripletap is done, but Im not sure if theres a better way, or even the best way to set this kind of thing up in a clean fashionp  pThanks in advance for any advice you can offer on thisp

Negative 64108 pI would like to split a string, with multiple delimiters, but keep the delimiters in the resulting list. I think this is a useful thing to do an an initial step of parsing any kind of formula, and I suspect there is a nice Python solution.p  pSomeone asked a similar question in Java a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions275768isthereawaytosplitstringswithstringsplitandincludethedelimitersherea.p  pFor example, a typical split looks like thisp  precodegtgtgt stwoplusthreeplusfour gtgtgt s.splitf, plus [two, three, four] codepre  pBut Im looking for a nice way to add the plus  back in or retain itp  precode[two, plus, three, plus, four] codepre  pUltimately Id like to do this for each operator and bracket, so if theres a way to get p  precode[, two, plus, three, , plus, four] codepre  pall in one go, then all the better.p

Negative 64108 pWe are developing a custom fixed assets solution for a customer using RFID tags and Motorola 919Z handheld reader. So far it has been going well, as we based on the Motorola examples for its EMDK. We are using VB.NET.p  pThe problem is, we have a set of Confidex Steelwave tags that cannot be tagged in a printer as they are hard tags, and so they were tagged using an example software, saving the relevant data into the USER memorybank, while another different set of printable Confidex tags was tagged using a Zebra RZ400 printer, and the relevant data was written to the EPC Tag ID field.p  pNow, we are asked to read both fields EPC Tag ID in one case, USER memorybank in the other, at the same time. That is, if the relevant data was tagged in the USER memorybank, the Tag ID contains irrelevant hex numbers, and if the EPC Tag ID was used, the USER memorybank is blank or zerofilled.p  pNow, we cannot find the way to read both banks at the same time without the user stopping reading and switching banks in software, so we are wondering if it is even possible in the first place. p  pIm not sure if I should post code, as it is kinda long... maybe the relevant part is that p  pIf we use  Inventory.Perform  ...it doesnt read the USER memorybank, and it doesnt seem to take access filtersp  pIf we use  OperationSequence.PerformSequence ...it forces you to specify the memorybank.p  pThanks for your time.p

Negative 64108 pLike many other people, Ive always been confused by volatile readswrites and fences. So now Im trying to fully understand what these do.p  pSo, a volatile read is supposed to 1 exhibit acquiresemantics and 2 guarantee that the value read is fresh, i.e., it is not a cached value. Lets focus on 2.p  pNow, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma10590927857807Ive reada that, if you want to perform a volatile read, you should introduce an acquire fence or a full fence after the read, like thisp  precodeint local  shared Thread.MemoryBarrier codepre  pHow exactly does this prevent the read operation from using a previously cached value According to the definition of a fence no readstores are allowed to be moved abovebelow the fence, I would insert the fence embeforeem the read, preventing the read from crossing the fence and being moved embackwardsem in time aka, being cached.p  pHow does preventing the read from being moved forwards in time or subsequent instructions from being moved backwards in time guarantee a volatile fresh read How does it helpp  hr  pSimilarly, I believe that a volatile write should introduce a fence emafterem the write operation, preventing the processor from moving the write forward in time aka, delaying the write.

Not only I normally wouldnt need it, but it also seems completely redundant as the response is served with a codeCacheControl nocachecode header must be revalidated and no means of validation no codeLastModifiedcodecodeETagcode, rendering the response unusable by any cache. Hence, it seems completely redundant.li licodeproxyrevalidatecode seems redundant due to the same reason above.li licodepubliccodecodeprivatecode seem redundant as well, as the response is unusable by any cache mechanism.li licodeprecheck0, postcheck0code are IEspecific values, which I believe to be unnecessary as well.li ul  hr  h2Contexth2  pIm not using SSLHTTPS, so the IE8 bugs which are said to appear with codeCacheControl nocachecode dont apply to this question.

Negative 64108 pIm trying to figure out why one of the queries in my rails app is under performing quite considerably. Im using Postgres 9.3, and rails 4.0.3 with jRuby 1.7.10 so potentially its an issue with the JDBC driverp  pBut basically, its a VERY simple queryp  precodeSELECT  FROM table codepre  pThe table contains code851code rows so its hardly a massive dataset, so Im expecting a fast query. When I execute this query in pgAdmin 3, I get exactly what I expect all rows returned in anywhere between 15 and 35ms. Nice and fastp  pFrom rails however its a different story. Running the query in a rails console, the fastest Ive been able to achieve is code189mscode whilst generally it is around the code200mscode mark. This query is run by calling codeTable.allcodep  pMy initial thought was simply that ActiveRecord is adding overhead in the instantiation of 851 objects, so thats obviously slowing it down. To test this, I ranp  precodeActiveRecordBase.connection.executeSELECT  FROM table codepre  pThere was a slight speedup, but again, almost all queries were taking around code150mscode, still a long way off the pgAdmin mark. As a last attempt I tried p  precodeActiveRecordBase.connection.execqueryrawSELECT  FROM table codepre  pBut this didnt improve the performance at all.p  pIm really stumped now as to why this is so much slower, given that I am seeing a 10x performance decrease between pgAdmin and Rails. Having executed just the raw SQL in Rails, I know its not ActiveRecord slowing things down, so Im really confused now as to what is.p  pDoes anyone know why this is so much slower than it should bep  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIve done some more digging, and it seems to be in the way rails is handling Date fields. If I manually select all of the columns in the table, it is just as slow, but if I select them all except for codeupdatedatcode and codecreatedatcode, the query runs in around 24ms which is perfectp  pMy only issue now then, is how to get around this. Is there a way of fixing rails performance issue with dates, or having rails not parse them as dates and keep them as strings or similarp  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pSo after doing some more digging and stonehz pointing me to the bug raised from this post, Ive upgraded to codeJruby 1.7.12code and coderails 4.1.0code and noticed a considerable speed up. Its its not a lot closer to the performance of pgAdmin, but I think that without removing the date columns completely, Im not going to get anything better. Below is the benchmark Im now gettingp  precodeSELECT                         4.080000   0.330000   4.410000   5.243000 SELECT datefields              1.960000   0.020000   1.980000   2.032000 SELECT   datefields          3.070000   0.070000   3.140000   3.247000  total 9.530000sec                                       user     system      total        real SELECT                         3.700000   0.060000   3.760000   4.663000 SELECT datefields              1.790000   0.020000   1.810000   2.021000 SELECT   datefields          2.330000   0.060000   2.390000   3.180000 codepre  pThis benchmark is querying 851 rows. The first test is a simple codeSELECT code statement. The second test only selects the date fields, and the final test selects all fields emexceptem for the date fields. Each query is being run 100 times to get the final result.p  pAs this shows, the codeselect code statement is now only taking 4 seconds to run 100 times, so each query is taking only code40mscode which is much closer to the pgAdmin time of 30ms. MUCH BETTERp

Negative 64108 pCross posting from a hrefhttpforums.gradle.orggradletopicsminmanifestmffilegeneratedthroughgradle relnofollowhttpforums.gradle.orggradletopicsminmanifestmffilegeneratedthroughgradleap  pI am seeing a problem with the jar manifest file in my gradle project. I am generating a manifest file for the jar in my build as p  precodeprojectmyproject          jar              manifest                  attributes ImplementationTitle My Project,                     ImplementationVersion project.version,                     BuiltBy System.getPropertyuser.name,                     BuiltDate new Date,                     BuiltJDK System.getPropertyjava.version,                     CreatedBy Gradle,                     GitCommit getSCMRevision,                     GitBranch getSCMBranch                        codepre  pwhere codegetSCMRevisioncode and codegetSCMBranchcode are static methods that are exposed through a custom plugin.p  pAfter the build executes, the MANIFEST.MF file has all the right information, however, it seems to add one or more M characters at the end of every line. Due to this, when I try to execute a java command using a main class that is contained in this projects jar, java errors as  codeError Could not find or load main classcode. This is presumably because the jar has a corrupt MANIFEST.MF. As soon as I unpack the jar, remove the M characters and rebuild the jar using jar cf, the java commands work.p  pI can see this error when I build both on OSX Mavericks as well as Centos 6.3. I am using gradle 1.11p  pIf this has to do with file encoding, is there a recommended way of setting the encoding Any other possible solutions to thisp  pThanks in advance,p  pBhooshanp  hr  pUPDATE This issue seems to occur because the methods codegetSCMRevisioncode and codegetSCMBranchcode are defined in a custom plugin. If I remove these methods, the MANIFEST.MF file does not contain M characters. If I completely move the manifest definition to the custom plugin, I see the issue. If I define everything in my projects build.gradle instead, I do not see the M characters. They seem to show up only if I invoke any functionality from the custom plugin in the manifest closure.p  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 64108 pI am trying to build mobile app which can stream video from both sidesi.e something like video calling.p  pI looked into webrtc, but thats not yet ready for mobile native apps as such and anyways what webrtc was doing was allowing browser to capture camera and audio directly without requiring plugins etc. But in native mobile apps capturing camera and audio isnt a issue and basically a very low latency and dual transport layer is needed. In many articles and places I read about using webrtc over websockets. p  pSo I thought I can stream the video using websockets. Is it correct or am I missing anythingp  pI understand that there is one more difference that webrtc is directly client to client...whereas websocket would be clientserverclient, is there anyway to avoid it.

Although I not new newbie, the lot of homework done regarding this was futile.p  pstrongSituationstrong Lets take an example and focus on it This theme allows the choice between two options for displaying the list of products Grid and List. On click on one of their anchors, the product list change from Grid to List without neither page reload, nor url change in the adress bar.p  pstrongProblemsstrong My goal is to add some data to the list displayed in both display options. So, I customized the template file codeproductlist.tplcode in order to print the additional attribute.The line of code executed. Butp  ul liThe printed element appear only in the Grid displaying not the List.li liWhen I swap between the two styles going back from List to Grid the added element dont show.li ul  pstrongMy current understandingstrongp  pI used to use developement tools in Chrome to find event listener breakpoints. In other words, a click on an anchor with class codelargecode lead me to the file where the code.large.onclickcode event is binded and let me find the javascript performed actions. But under the defaultbootstrap theme, this operation only leads me to codejquery1.1.10.min.jscode which isas you know a minimified file of the jQuery library. I expected finding another file that contains the event listener that uses this library something like code.large.onclick....code. p  pstrongQuestionsstrong How to find the specific javascript code that performs the update of page content on click Which is the filefiles that hold the reponsiveness of the current theme In all my js files, I dont find any   classname of elements triggering actions something like codelargecode.p  pstrongEdit Based on David Taiaroa answerstrong The class of the unordered list codeltulgtcode changes from codegridcode to codelistcode after click on the anchors. But there is not much styles attached to these classes. What is happening is that all the content of the codeltligtcodes is altered. Normally I should find something like codeul.toggleClassgridcode andor some jQueryAJAX  How to find AJAX code if any exist in this actual theme Even in Network, there is no GET requests after click like usually when AJAX is used. Thats odd, is it maybe related to the way Bootstrap worksp  pYour help is so much invaluable to me. Thanks in advance.p  pstrongSolutionstrongp  pThe file that contains the concerned javascript in the defaultbootstrap theme of Prestashop 1.6 is codeglobal.jscode.

Ive also made a neat little gem that also has a pretty little copyright next to it. Its not open source.

So, to test the whole application I might dop  precode rspec spec  cd customgem ampamp rspec spec codepre  pThats nice, but what if I want to run the whole suit from one line Well I could dop  precode rspec spec customgemspec codepre  pBut, this doesnt work in my case because the gem is also a Rails engine.

Negative 64108 pI have been going through pagination tutorials for past 1 week. I have an html page wherein user enter values into the textfields and click submit button. The page then redirects to a php page which displays corresponding output from the sql database. The database makes use of variables which were received by the php script from the HTML page.

When I run this query again to calculate total number of rows and also total number of page links to be displayed in pagination, that works as well. However, whenever I click next page using pagination, the code forgets the value of variables imported earlier from html page. I tried to pass it using the url but has been unsuccessful. I believe somehow the values from html page must be retained by the program at all times to make query execute successfully at all times. Can anyone provide me some basic example or a url that could help me understand the process Thanksp

Negative 64108 pIm not sure how to go about this. I have a relational database that information was just migrated too. Since the schema was changed from the old database, it took about 3 weeks to transfer the data properly. The old production database was still being used during that time. I have no transferred the remaining data, however this second migration just inserted new rows into the main table called tVehicleDeal and inserted the new values into the log table called tVehicleLog. My question is.. how can I update tVehicleDeal based on the last entry made into the tVehicleLog My idea is that since the newest logs were inserted into the tVehicleLog table, then that should be the latest entry and I can use that entry to update tVehicleDeal. I know I can do something similar to this, but not sure how to get the last one for a deal.p  precodeUPDATE dbo.tVehicleDeal  SET InternalLocationID  l.InternalLocationID FROM dbo.tVehicleLog l WHERE l.DealID  tVehicleDeal.DealID codepre  pIs there a way to do this properly Any suggestions are helpful p

Whats going on herep  pstrongUpdatestrong I made the parameter optional, and then the method IS called, but the parameter is not passed, and instead uses the default.

Negative 64108 pI am totally new to iOS development and have been requested by my company to jump into some code written by another amateur that left us and fix it. The main view of this app is just a table view and we would like the user to be able to select one cell from the table, which would highlight it and set some other buttons on the page to do something to that particular cell.p  pMaking the other buttons on the page works just fine, as long as I know what cell is selected, so I am not too worried about that. But the code this other guy wrote to select one cell at a time is atrocious, and the code I tried to replace his with was better, but still very buggy.p  pMy code is this written below sort of adopted from the old stuff that I dont completely understand. The issue with it is that the background turns black when the cell is clicked twice in a row or if you change views and come back to this table view.p  precode     voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath       for int i  0 i lt [tableView numberOfRowsInSection0] i          [tableView deselectRowAtIndexPathcurrentSelection animatedtrue]           ifcurrentSelection.item  indexPath.item         [tableView deselectRowAtIndexPathcurrentSelection animatedtrue]            UITableViewCell cell  [tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathindexPath]      highlight bg to light grey     cell.backgroundColor [UIColor colorWithRed200255 green200255 blue200255 alpha1.0f]     currentSelection  indexPath      code for other button functions      voidtableViewUITableView tableView didDeselectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      UITableViewCell cell  [tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathindexPath]      set bg back to white     cell.backgroundColor [UIColor colorWithRed255255 green255255 blue255255 alpha1.0f]     noSelectedRows  true  codepre  pIf that is too terrible too look at and try to fix, I was looking at a tutorial provided by Apple that I wanted to understand a little better anyway.

However, if I add a destructor     PolygonPolygon  delete [] vertices then     cout ltlt pl ltlt endl will not work because the codePolygoncode has gone out of scope and the destructor frees the vertices.p  pI could have the codePolyListcode destructor call a codePolygongtfreecode function. Alternatively, I could have the codePolygonPolygonVertex vcode deep copy all the vertices in v. Then codePolyListPolyListPolygon amppcode could deep copy p.p  pI could also make a codePolyListcreatePolygonint x1, int y1, int x2, int y2...code but that flies in the face of OO.p  pWhat is the proper way to handle this kind of situation in C Never mind my actual example where a memory leak would not be a problem, Im talking in principle. If I make an hierarchical object tree, I want to copy the pointers, not deep copy the objects.p  pEDIT Im trying to learn C on a deep level, so this is not about using vectorlt or another canned solution that is not what Im after here, though Im sure that is a good solution if the above example was an actual problem I was having. The example above is just the briefest example I could think of to explain my question.p
Negative 64108 pI am working on a piece of code that computes some values based on timing data.

What would be causing this and can it be avoided without using the volatile keyword.p  pNoteI am not that familiar with the volatile keyword beyond that it can be used to prevent unused variables from being optimized out.p

Negative 64108 pI am creating an Android app using one main activity and multiple fragments. I am using the navigation drawer which has two items in it  Fragment A and Fragment B. From Fragment A you can go to 2 lower level fragments and the same for Fragment B. In my case there is a button in Fragment B.1 and Fragment B.2 which allows you to go directly to Fragment A.3. see image belowp  pThis all works well with the back stack however I want to also implement the home Up button. Usually if you are using multiple activities you would use the NavUtils class but I cant use this for fragments. Instead I have implemented the solution found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma199540263992651herea. Unfortunately this does not follow the navigation pattern correctly in my case as when I click on the button in Fragment B.2 to go to Fragment A.3 and then click the the up button it takes me back to Fragment B.2 instead of up to Fragment A.2.p  pThe navigation pattern I am talking about is shown here i.stack.imgur.comEsoTl.pngp  pMy app navigation looks like this i.stack.imgur.com8WjBr.pngp  pThe codep  precodeprivate FragmentManager.OnBackStackChangedListener         mOnBackStackChangedListener  new FragmentManager.OnBackStackChangedListener      Override     public void onBackStackChanged          setActionBarArrowDependingOnFragmentsBackStack         Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.main       get the title of the current page     title  drawerTitle  getTitle       load slide menu item titles     navMenuTitles  getResources.getStringArrayR.array.navmenuitems      navMenuLayout  DrawerLayout findViewByIdR.id.navmenulayout     navMenuList  ListView findViewByIdR.id.navmenulist      navMenuItems  new ArrayListltNavMenuItemgt       Instantiate a NavMenuItem object and add it to an ArrayList.     for int i  0 i lt navMenuTitles.length i         navMenuItems.addnew NavMenuItemnavMenuTitles[i]            setting the nav menu list adapter     adapter  new NavMenuListAdaptergetApplicationContext,navMenuItems     navMenuList.setAdapteradapter       enabling action bar app icon and behaving it as toggle button     getActionBar.setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabledtrue     getActionBar.setHomeButtonEnabledtrue       setup the onItemClickListener to load correct page when user clicks on navigation item     navMenuList.setOnItemClickListenernew AdapterView.OnItemClickListener          Override         public void onItemClickAdapterViewltgt parent, View view, int position, long id              displayFragmentposition                      mDrawerToggle  new ActionBarDrawerTogglethis, navMenuLayout,             R.drawable.icdrawer, nav menu toggle icon             R.string.appname,  nav drawer open  description for accessibility             R.string.appname  nav drawer close  description for accessibility              public void onDrawerClosedView view              getActionBar.setTitletitle                   public void onDrawerOpenedView drawerView              getActionBar.setTitledrawerTitle                    navMenuLayout.setDrawerListenermDrawerToggle     getSupportFragmentManager.addOnBackStackChangedListenermOnBackStackChangedListener       if this is the first time the app is being opened then open the first page from the list.     if savedInstanceState  null           on first time display view for first nav item         displayFragment0         Override protected void onDestroy      getSupportFragmentManager.removeOnBackStackChangedListenermOnBackStackChangedListener     super.onDestroy   private void setActionBarArrowDependingOnFragmentsBackStack      int backStackEntryCount              getSupportFragmentManager.getBackStackEntryCount     mDrawerToggle.setDrawerIndicatorEnabledbackStackEntryCount  0   Override public boolean onOptionsItemSelectedMenuItem item       if mDrawerToggle.isDrawerIndicatorEnabled ampamp             mDrawerToggle.onOptionsItemSelecteditem          return true      else if item.getItemId  android.R.id.home ampamp             getSupportFragmentManager.popBackStackImmediate          return true      else          switch item.getItemId                   handle other items in actionbar             default                 return super.onOptionsItemSelecteditem                codepre

Negative 64108 pMy problem is hard for me to explain in words, so Ill just explain briefly, and hope you understand what Im trying to say. p  pIm trying to access a protected and final variable inside a class located in an interior package in the same project  that is, codecom.example.Maincode accessing codecom.example.package.SomeClass.thisVarHerecode.

Is there even a way for me to accomplish this, or am I forced to set it as public and hope that no outside parties will access it Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thank youp

Negative 64108 pI am confused about the point at which a web application diverges into microservices  is it at url level or models level As an example, Suppose I have a monolithic app that serves 3 pages. Say each page serves a separate usecase and i want to back eack of them with their own microservices. Now, which of these is the correct way of implementing a microservice based architecturep  ul liI create three different appsmicroservices, each containing the route, controller, models, templates for one of the pages. And then based on which ever page is requested, I route the request to that particular app. This means that the whole page from database to HTML is served by a separate app. Basically, different pages in the same website are being completely served by different apps on the backend.li liThe 3 microservices do not handle the UI stuff but only the data for their usecasesmodels, controller, no templates and expose it over a REST api. I have one public facing app. This app queries the three different appsmicroservices only for the data and then builds the html pages to be returned to browser.

Negative 64108 pI have noticed a big issues with xcode 6. The app data folder keeps switching and there are usually a couple of copies out there. I dont really know why xcode is doing this but its very troublesome. The big issue is that when I start the app sometimes it looks at one folder and sometimes another, if I had saved some data in the data folder, sometimes the data is inconsistent between the two. p  pI use the SimPholders2 App to find these folders. Which was quite a challenge already. So the question is, is there a safe and secure way to save the data in the simulator to make sure that it stays consistentp

Negative 64108 pIve implemented an OnTouchListener for my GridView so that I may detect if the user touched a TextView and if so I change its shape, then upon release its supposed to reset the shape to the original. It works, except in one case. If I touch down on a TextView then drag the finger to a different TextView and then release, it will reset the shape of the TextView that the finger was over upon release, when I need it to reset the first TextView touched.p  pTo solve the issue I would like to add an OnTouchListener to each TextView instead of the entire GridView. Then I can be sure upon release the shape gets reset. How do you do that though, there is no OnItemTouchListerner I can apply to the GridView.

Negative 64108 pIn the browser debugger, tab Inspector theres a field search, but when I enter the id of tag the seach does not offer any result, in spite of the fact that the tag with this id emisem there. Can it be that this search field can only find tag names, like span or div If so, is there a way for me to seach tag IDs using firefox debuggerp  pUsually I use Chrome debugger where the search in the debugger works like I expect it. But now I need to debug an issue that is specific to firefox. So I am unfamiliar with the firefox debugger. My googlesearch for codefirefox debugger search htmlcode did not return any helpful results.p  pIm using Firefox version 36.0.p

Negative 64108 pI have an object containing cyclic references. According to the XStream Json documentation, cyclic references are NOT supported, and one should therefore use a hrefhttpxstream.codehaus.orggraphs.html relnofollowthe NOREFERENCES XStream modea when marshalling an object to Jsonp  blockquote   pWhat limitations has XStreams JSON supportp      pJSON represents a very simple data model for easy data transfer.   Especially it has no equivalent for XML attributes. Those are written   with a leading  character, but this is not always possible without   violating the syntax e.g. for array types. Those may silently   dropped and makes it therefore difficult to implement   deserialization. References are another issue in the serialized   object graph, since JSON has no possibility to express such a   construct. You should therefore always set the NOREFERENCES mode of   XStream. Additionally you cannot use implicit collections, since the   properties in a JSON object must have unique names.p blockquote  pBut I tried setting the mode to IDREFERENCES and it appears as though the Object is marshalled emwithem references, and the object can be unmarshalled properly. Is the XStream documentation simply outdated, or have I simply inadvertently created the object graph in such a way that I havent hit any of the limitationsp  pSorry, but I cant post my exact graph as an example as it contains applicationdomainspecific code and it might take some time to construct a clean alternative.p
Negative 64108 pI recently downloaded the Bitbucket plugin for Android Studio Im running 1.1.0. Initially, I downloaded it from this link a hrefhttpsplugins.jetbrains.complugin6207prphpStorm relnofollowhttpsplugins.jetbrains.complugin6207prphpStorma which should be compatible with Android studio. p  pWhen I tried to clone a project in my repo, it prompted me for login credentials.

Then I installed the plugin from the plugin settings page seen here img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMV7AV.png altscreenshotp  pI made sure that the plugin was enabled. Im thinking this is an issue that has to do with proxy settings Im currently on my college campuses network, but I can connect to other VCS services like Git without problems so I doubt thats the problem. p  pAny suggestionsp  pstrongEDITstrong Going into Bitbuckets settings and testing it shows this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comndH4E.png altscreenshotp
Negative 64108 pI have recently discovered the following factsp  pThe first time I navigate through pages of my application, perm gem is growing up significantly. Thats normalp  pMy perm gen is growing up when I am navigating through pages of my application that I have already navigated through.  But this is only happening if I stop using my application for a few minutes. If I dont do that perm gen remains the same though I keep navigating. The increase is not much but I think is not a normal behaviour. p  pI also noticed that perm gen never goes down or It goes down a little bit.p  pWhat can be the cause of thatp  pI am using Java6, Tomcat6, Hibernate, Spring 3.3.4 and JSF 1.2.p

Or alternatively not even expecting a reply from the server.  p

Negative 64108 pLately Ive been working in some project and the thing is that weve encountered a situation in which we need to be able to do stuff like this.p  precodedefine TYPEDType      virtual Type typedThis const  return Type this   class A  public  TYPEDA virtual void describe  stdcout ltlt I am type An  static int x   int Ax  1  class B  public A  public  TYPEDB  virtual void describe  stdcout ltlt I am type Bn  static int x   int Bx  2  int mainint argc, char argv      B b  new B     A b2  b      bgtdescribe     b2gtdescribe      stdcout ltlt bgttypedThisgtx ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt b2gttypedThisgtx ltlt stdendl  AQUI DEBERIA DAR 2  c  codepre  pThis is of course just a toy example. The basic idea of what we would like to do is to define a function typedThis who does the casting of the pointer into the correct type and then access to the correct variable x, and printing out 2 instead of 1.p  pHowever, the output is the followingp  precodeI am type B I am type B 2 1 Here should also be 2 codepre  pWhat I find really interesting is that the virtual method describe seems to be working the way we want. Therefore, I could infer that the method typedThis is also working the way we would like to. But if so, why does C see this pointer as an A instead of an B. If C saw this pointer like a B then it would have used the correct variable x. strongCan someone explain this to mestrongp  pI tried using CRTP, however I dont feel like this would make things easier, because in the project we will be using a lot A LOT of different classes who derive between them constantly, I saw some articles of how to use CRTP when having multiple inheritance, however they are really messy and hard to integrate with what we have so far.p

Negative 64108 pI am using Weka for text classification.  I have 24 columns in my dataset out of which only 2 are required for classifying the text. Hence I removed unwanted columns in Weka through preprocessing step.  Now my two columns are the class label Numeric and Text Nominal. I want to divide my data into training and testing set. Build multinomial classifier using training set. and predict the numeric label for remaining set.  In classify, I want to classify, the text column and have to analyze metrics for the predicted class label. How do I do in classify Classify does not allow Nominal data type for Naive Bayes. I am new to Weka and going through tutorials however not able to figure out what exactly should I do in this case p

Negative 64108 pI am using angular directive for date picker from UI bootstrap. I also use ngrepeat to add multiple rows. I have added date picker code in ngrepeat. I have displayed these date pickers in bootstrap modal. Also ngrepeat is work fine. But if I add multiple row and click on single calendar icon then all calendar popups of all date picker are shown. I dont know why should this happened. I use codeisopenparent.opened1code to perform click on calendar button. If I use only codeisopenopened1code then calendar popoup will open only once means can not open after selecting any date. And if I use codeisopenparent.opened1code then after adding multiple rows all calendar popup is open.

Negative 64108 pI have pages that I have to print, but when I launch printing, the preview is ugly and I cant select and modify the elements I want theres only few elements I want to print, and others that I hide only for the printing.p  pI dont succeed to do it with less with codemedia printcode, so I made a template and I inject inside it the elements I want to show for the printing with AngularJS. The problem is that the original page is something like codehttpexample.comidpagenametabmediacode. But I put in my script a listener which catch the print event and redirect the user on codehttpexample.comidpagenametabmediaampprinttruecode.p  pThen a timeout launches the printing script codewindow.printcode, and when the user leave the printing page, the script redirects him to codehttpexample.comidpagenametabmediacode. p  pThe problem is that it makes a lot of closingopening windows, and it may be uncomfortable for the user. I think my solution is weird and awkward, but I found nothing else to do it...p  pSo do you have a solution to print a distant page, which will not make a lot of closingopening framesp  pFor example, when I codeCtrlPcode on codehttpexample.comidpagenametabmediacode, it prints the codehttpexample.comidpagenametabmediaampprinttruecode page, and not the original p  pA thing like codedocument.location.hrefhttpexample.comidpagenametabmediaampprinttrue.printcode or codeprinthttpexample.comidpagenametabmediaampprinttruecode p  pI hope its possiblep
Negative 64108 pHello guys just wanted to check with you if the use case diagram for the following question is correct brp  blockquote   pHomework assignment and collection are an integral part of any educational system. Today, this task is performed manually. What we want the homework assignment distribution and collection system HACS for short to do is to automate this process.  HACS will be used by the instructor to distribute the homework assignments, review the students solutions, distribute suggested solution, and distribute student grades on each assignment.  HACS shall also help the students by automatically distributing the assignments to the students, provide a facility where the students can submit their solutions, remind the students when an assignment is almost due, remind the students when an assignment is overdue.p blockquote  pThis is the screenshot of what i did in StarUML img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comamqWh.png altenter image description herep  pAccording to you, is it correct Im confused whether the instructor and students need to have an association and whether theres the need for the Automated System actor. Any suggestions will be appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 64108 pI just wonder to know the logic of paperclip when files are being saved and used later..p  pSo what is surprising mep  pI have model with paperclip attachment.

Is there separate table to show attachment filename synonyms p

In the Contexts Execute method where the modified tree was passed into the IQueryables Provider.CreateQuery call I simply wrapped the IEnumerable.AsQueryable in a ConstantExpression and that appears to be have made things function now.  That said, I am slightly concerned that I have lost other functionality here, but its unclear what that lost functionality is, at this time. p

Since the application domain is very technical, Ill illustrate my problem with a simple example.p  pSuppose I have the following interfacesp  precodepublic interface Animal      public void feedAnimalFood food   public interface AnimalFood       some methods  codepre  pAnd the two following classes implementing the interfacesp  precodepublic class DogFood implements AnimalFood       some methods   public class CatFood implements AnimalFood       some methods   public class Dog implements Animal      public void feedAnimalFood food          can only eat dog food        public class Cat implements Animal      public void feedAnimalFood food          can only eat cat food       codepre  pThis means that everytime I feed a codeDogcode or a codeCatcode instance, Ill have to validate if the received instance of codeDogFoodcode or codeCatFoodcode and throw an exception if this is not the right kind of food.p  pThis smells bad to me, and I am pretty sure to violate the Liskov substitution principle p  pIs there a design pattern, or what would be an elegant way to manage this situationp

Negative 64108 pI have a multi device project in Delphi Xe8. I have a TListBox component that i load with database records.p  pThe problem is that sometimes the list can be really big and so the loading will take long. So I want to load it partially and when I scroll down load new records. How do I do thatp  pRight now i load every record of my table using a TFDQuery.p  pstrongUpdatestrong After some timing I have realized that the problem doesnt lay with loading all the records from the database, but rather with creating all the TListBoxItems in the TListBox. So I still want to do pretty much the same, but now load all the database records but not create TListBoxItems for all of them.p

Negative 64108 pIm looking for an algorithm that finds the smallest box enclosing a polyhedron.p  pMy idea is as follows find the largest side, and move the solid so that side aligns with the x axis. Find the next largest side that meets this side, and align it as close as possible to the z axis, while leaving the other side on x. Then, calculate the greatest differences in x, y and z. Use those dimensions to create the surrounding shape and then shift the box back to the objects original location. p  pIs there a more efficient strategy for this Does my idea overlook some corner casesp  pEdit For now assume the object to be bounded is convex. Though, an answer for the general case would also be welcome.p

Negative 64108 pWe have a couple of projects in our branch. I checked them out with the help of eclipse and subclipse. I would like to achieve  the following I want to automatically merge changes for all the projects from the trunk into the branch and commit them in one commit via commandline. So I make an svn update on all of the projects, perform the merge but cant get it to work that I can commit all the projects at once basically a kind of atomic commit, that is because every of the project has its own working copy, but for performing a atomic commit they need to be in the same working copy. It must be somehow possible to create a working copy that contains all of the projects, because if I do the merge using eclipse I have this all or nothing atomic commit, so eclipse seems to create a working copy with all projects inside somehow.p  pIn a nutshell How do I create a new working copy that contains all of the projects without doing a completly new checkout of the complete branch, so that I can commit the projects all or nothing if an error occursp  pI am using svn 1.6 at the moment.p

Negative 64108 pI have been trying to make a responsive dashboard using D3. I have some previous experience but havent used bootstrap extensively before. Posts I have researched mentioned using bootstrap and then ViewBox to make D3 SVGs reactive. p  pHowever, when I tried this I found my SVGs didnt show up. Specifically the bootstrap row  remains at 1px of height even after I have entered the SVG. Even more weird is that if I hardcode an SVG with height  960 width  500 i.e. hardcoded in html then the row still remains at 1px.p  pIve looked everywhere but I cant find what is wrong.

Negative 64108 pIm in the process of creating a sidescrolling action game where you play a wizard that can cast spells. The spells are Box2D bodies that start in the middle of your player who is also a Box2D body and go outward in the direction you clicked on the screen.p  pI have all the collision detection working to where the spells you cast dont collide with each other and they dont collide with you. This works moreorless flawlessly  except for one instance. The first spell I cast creates a collision with the player that causes a brief period of physical knockback. The spells path is not affected otherwise, and I dont notice a major change in the players position. The only reason I know there is knockback at all is because the camera I have following the player suddenly shakes in that instant and Ive gone through the contact listener to verify that these particular bodies are forming a contact. p  pThis is not the case for subsequent spells that are spawned from the same position, and it doesnt seem to be a problem that is related to the players move speed or the projectiles cast angle. It may have something to do with how Box2D initializes items, but I couldnt promise that.p  pDoes anyone know how I could fix thisp

I made a test codeRecyclerViewcode stripped down to match the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.android.comtrainingmateriallistscards.html relnofollowofficial documentationa, using a single image for 200 codeCardViewcodes with an codeImageViewcode, but the problem persists. Most of the images are loaded from memory green and scrolling is smooth, but about every tenth codeImageViewcode loads the image from disk blue. When the image is loaded from disk, a memory allocation is performed, thereby increasing the allocation on the heap and thus the heap itself.p  pI tried removing my own setup of the global codePicassocode instance and using the default instead, but the problems are the same.p  pI did a check with the Android Device Monitor, see the image below. This is for a Galaxy S3. Each of the allocations done when an image is loaded from disk can be seen to the right under Allocation count per size. The size is slightly different for each allocation of the image, which is also weird.

Negative 64108 pI am making a website that helps manipulate an SQL table. At the moment, I want to be able to reload my page but with some new variables like a new County Code or something. The way Ive done it is by making a form called rerouter with a few hidden textareas and an action which is just currentPage.php. Like sop  precode    ltform actionconnect.php methodpost idreroutergt         ltinput typehidden namefoo idfoogtltinputgt         ltinput typehidden namebar idbargtltinputgt         ltinput typehidden namefoobar idfoobargtltinputgt     ltformgt codepre  pWhen it comes time to reload the page I populate those textareas with the new values Ill want, then I submit the form, like this the getRequest calls another PHP file which just creates an SQL string and executes it. Im just including it here to show that theres logic before the rerouting process which still executesp  precode    ...     getRequeststr, succ, err      document.getElementByIdfoo.value  fooText     document.getElementByIdfoo.value  barTest     document.getElementByIdfoobar.value  foobarText     document.forms[rerouter].submit codepre  pThis works great, except on occasion the whole page freezes. The only way to unfreeze it is to reload the page, then it prompts you with the Oh, snap error in Chrome which you need to reload. The getRequest still occurs fine, but the code hangs somewhere after. I have not found a way to consistently reproduce the problem except for calling this function over and over until it finally fails, but I will keep you all informed if I discover a pattern. Also, I do not have access to jQuery.p  pSOLUTION HaukurHaf pointed out I was using an asynchronous AJAX call unstably. On occasion the PHP called by getRequest had not finished when forms.submit was called. I moved some code around so my main function looks likep  precode            ...     document.getElementByIdfoo.value  fooText     document.getElementByIdfoo.value  barTest     document.getElementByIdfoobar.value  foobarText      getRequeststr, succ, err codepre  pand my succ function looks likep  precode    function succ          document.forms[rerouter].submit      codepre  pit was empty before. Now the form wont submit until were absolutely sure the PHP has finished executing.p

Sometimes, I cant even kbdBackspacekbd all the way back, but instead get stuck somewhere to the right of codelocode or whatever other command Im attempting to issue. I can still hit kbdEnterkbd, though, to try again.p  pThe arrow keys dont invoke command history. If I press kbd9650kbd, the cursor moves up, but Id have expected it to cycle through my command history.p  pThis issue seems to be related to Git Bash, because GHCI works correctly in PowerShell on the same machine. On other machines where Im running an earlier version of Git Bash git version 1.9.5.msysgit.1, I dont have this problem, so it seems to be related to this particular version git version 2.5.1.windows.1.p  pMy operating system is Windows 10 64bit. At first I thought that this issue was related to 64bit Git Bash, because this is the first time Ive seen a 64bit Git Bash on Windows, but Ive also tried installing the 32bit Git Bash, and it exhibits the exact same behaviour.p  pIs it possible to make GHCI behave correctly in this environmentp

Negative 64108 pIm looking for a way to display a tree in the first column of a tablegrid with three other columns, one with a combobox and the others with checkboxes.  Ive been trying to make this work with a TreeViewer but it doesnt quite fit what Im looking for.  The tree goes together fine. The Combobox column where I used the EditorSupport for the column and return a ComboboxCellEditor in the getCellEditor method but you can only see that there is a combobox in the column when you select a cell in that column. Then when you click out of the cell the selected value goes back to the default blank. The same goes for the checkbox columns where it is is only visible when the cell is selected.  Im looking for something that will display my tree with the combobox column and checkbox columns always visible.  Ive looked at TableViewer but couldnt find a way to force in a tree in the first column.  Ive looked at Nebula Grid but that doesnt look like it supports comboboxes. Any tips on how to get one of these to work like what I am looking for or if there is some other treetablegrid I should be looking at.

Negative 64108 pI am currently writing a set of Wrappers for some native C code.

But I recently learnt that some email platforms or software Outlook up to 2013 for instance does not support GIFs in emails.p  pI was wondering strongIs there any way to provide an alternative image if the animated GIF is not supported by the platformsoftwarestrong For example can I make a .jpeg image appear instead of the GIF if and only if the GIF is not supported or correctly displayed...p
Negative 64108 pI have an array of cars in a backend, whose length is user defined. So if the user selects 3 cars the array will have 3 elements in it.

Negative 64108 pMy Watch OS2 app has a glance, the top group is a static label, the bottom group is a WKInterfaceTable that gets populated via a call to HealthKit workouts.  I also have an image as the bottom groups background.  p  pThe main part of the app features the same data loaded in a WKInterfaceTable.p  pI am testing on an Apple Watch and iPhone 5s.  p  pThe app itself works fine, no delay in loading the data at all.  p  pHowever, the glance 9 times out of 10 only loads the top static label and not the bottom group not even the background image  Every so often it will load correctly.  Ive uninstalled and reinstalled but I cant figure it out.  Does the glance have anything to do with quality of network connection  Im stumped.  p
Negative 64108 pI am building an codeiFramecode to be used by third parties. Now, for the codeiFramecode, I need some vendor files like codejQuery, jQueryUI, jQueryvalidate, fontawesomecode. This has elongated the loading process. What are the solutions for faster loadingp  pSome solutions that I have in mind arep  p1 Most probably the client will have some of them already loaded. Some how if I could use them, that could shorten the loading time. But I tried doing that with no success.p  p2 The customer is likely to browse through the client site before using my codeiFramecode. If I could use that time to download the files and then inject them into the codeiFramecode, it could too shorten the time lag.p  pstrongMy Approachstrongp  pI added the codejQuerycode file to the codeheadcode of the codeiFramecode as shown belowp  precodevar s  document.createElementscript s.type  textjavascript s.src  httpscdnjs.cloudflare.comajaxlibsjquery.selectboxit3.8.0jquery.selectBoxIt.min.js pgiframe.contents.findhead.appends codepre  pHowever when the server renders the page of codeiFramecode, the head tag is replaced by the head tag of the rendered page. As a result, I need to have the codescriptcode tags in the html page too thereby ending with multiple downloads.p  pAm I thinking the right way or have messed it up. It could be great to have some feedback.p
Negative 64108 pI am using ASP.NET boilerplate for the first time. I have been able to apply the strongApplicationName.Corestrong, strongApplicationName.Applicationstrong and strongApplicationName.ORMstrong NHibernate libraries with success.p  pHowever, I need to make my application services available as a web service. My understanding is that once I deploy the library named strongApplicationName.WebApistrong as a web application to IIS, I automatically have a web service which exposes my application services through apiservices.p  pWhen I did this, I kept getting error 404.0 as shown below when I try to make requests to the API over my browserp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comGykJD.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comGykJD.png altError 404.0 for WebApia p  pI need some advice on where exactly I am getting things wrong.
