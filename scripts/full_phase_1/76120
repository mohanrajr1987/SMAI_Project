Positive 76120 pI am part of a large application and we are attempting to add translations to the app. We are using I18n and enUS.yml is our default file the translator refers to unless a user signs up with a different language. I have discovered in development that if a user isnt logged in, all translated phrases show up fine. However, once you log in, any new pages now render with errors like thisp  precodetranslation missing pages.perspectivemetricspage.weight codepre  pNow, any pages you visited before logging in will render with the translations and no error, and even if you log out any pages you have visited while logged in will continue to render with errors.

This is the gem we are using for putting I18n code in our javascript.p  precode allow rails internationalization to be used in javascript gem i18njs, gt 3.0.0.rc8  codepre  pIt seems to me there is some kind of issue with the way things are being cached or with the loading of I18n compared to the models.

Negative 76120 pI was wondering if it is possible at runtime to dynamically add new properties to an ObjectiveC object instance p  pMy initial thought would just to overrride the getValueForKey to fake a property but it seems like this doesnt work with CoreAnimation. What I want to achieve is to be able to animate custom properties. I have been able to get that to work if I create a subclass of CALayer and add declared properties to my subclass. If I try to use the getValueForKeysetValueForKey strategy it seems like CoreAnimation doesnt care for that and it is explicitly looking for declared properties.p  pI would like to be able to dynamically add the properties because I might not know what property I want to animate until runtime. I can of course create a CALayer subclass that has all the properties that I would ever want to animate...but just wondering if there is a nicer way to do this... p  pThanks,p  pPeterp

Negative 76120 pI have a VB.NET 2005 application designed by my boss that uses a over 100 input and display controls textboxes, comboxes, etc., many with labels associated. My boss asked me to set the tab order, and then trap keypress so the user can use enter to navigate controls. I have 2 apps like this to work on.p  pFor the tab order, I could not use the ViewTabOrder feature, since there are so many blue little tabindex popups showing, that I can not see any of the controls on the form to click. I tried clicking through the popup with some success, but it still did not give me the tab order I wanted. The tab assistant that came with CodeSMART did not give me the result I wanted, either, so I could use it. p  pThe controls on this usercontrol are spread among many groups, which in turn are spread among several splitcontainer panels. The 1st panel in the main splitcontainer has 3 main groupboxes which are selected via a toolstripbutton  which sets the desired groupbox to visible and turning the others to invisible. p  pExamplep  precodePrivate Sub ShowMainPanel     Note Panels are groupboxes     Me.MaterialPanel.Visible  False     Me.HaulPanel.Visible  False     Me.MainPanel.Visible  True  End Sub codepre  pEach of these groupboxes contain more groupboxes, each of which contain 1 to 15 controls. Some are read only, but others need information from the user. The required controls have their tab stop set to true.p  pSo I MANUALLY set each of the main group panels tabindexes as 0 thru 2. Then for the 1st groupboxmainpanel, I set the tabindex for each of its controls and groupboxes that are contained within. The noncontainer type controls have their tabindexes set to 0 thru 25, and then the groupboxes sub groups on the mainpanel are 26 thru 48. I then went to each control in these sub groups and set tab index for those controls starting at 0 thru Control.count1 for the group. p  pIn summary, my tab orders look like this abbreviatedp  precodemainPanel  0   1st fields  0.0   2ndfield  0.1   3rd field  0.2   1st group  0.3     1st field in 1st grp1  0.3.0     2nd field in 1st grp1  0.3.1   2nd group  0.4     1st field in 1st grp2  0.4.0     2nd field in 1st grp2  0.4.1 materialPanel  1   1st fields  1.0   2ndfield  1.1   3rd field  1.2   1st group  1.3     1st field in 1st grp1  1.3.0     2nd field in 1st grp1  1.3.1   2nd group  1.4     1st field in 1st grp2  1.4.0     2nd field in 1st grp2  1.4.1 codepre  pNote I did not actually enter, for instance, 1.4.0 for a tabindex, but 0 for the control, 4 for the sub group and 1 for main group.p  pI then set the zorder via the Document Outline panel in based on the tab order.p  pOnce I did all of this I was finally able to get the tab order I wanted to work for the mainpanel. p  pBut when I applied the same to the other 2 groupboxes materialPanel and haulpanel, the tabs are completely ignored. Tab does not work at all within the app. for the 2nd to main groupboxes MaterialPanel and HaulPanel. The app is Control Library so I use the built in UserTestContainer when debugging, and when one of the 2nd 2 groupboxes are showing, the tab key moves the focus out of the app and into the test container. p  pThis does not happen when on the 1st groupbox MainPanel. It works fine.p  pSetting this stuff out took me about 34 hours to tedious work. Due to the number of controls, this application is hard to work with, as anytime a change is made to the form designer, it takes a good 1520 seconds to process it.p  pDoes anyone have a clue about whats going on herep

Negative 76120 pIs there a way to fill the free RAM on a linux machine with random datap  pThe reason Im asking this Im working in a group where we do numerical programming in Fortran. Sometimes, people mess up working with double precision reals, so that programs that should give double precision results only give single precision.p  pIf my understanding is correct, one would see random fluctuations of the result after the single precision limit in such a program. That is, if you run the same program with the same input several times, you get randomly different result each time. What you see the random part depends on the random values in the free RAM of the machine. But in practice, if you run the program repeatedly on the same machine, the same parts of memory tend to be used repeatedly, which have the same random data in them, leading the same output every time. p  pMy idea is that if you could overwrite the memory with random data, you would actually see the random fluctuations in your program output. That would make it a lot easier to find these bugs.p  pIs this idea whack, or if not, how do I fill the memory Can I pipe devrandom into the RAM, or somethingp

Negative 76120 pIm new to Python I have been programming in Java for multiple years now though, and I am working on a simple socketbased networking application just for fun. The idea is that my code connects to a remote TCP endpoint and then listens for any data being pushed from the server to the client, and perform some parsing on this.p  pThe data being pushed from server  client is UTF8 encoded text, and each line is delimited by codeCRLFcode codex0Dx0Acode. You probably guessed the idea is that the client connects to the server until cancelled by the user, and then reads and parses the lines as they come in.p  pIve managed to get this to work, however, Im not sure that Im doing this quite the right way. So hence my actual questions code to followp  ol liIs this the right way to do it in Python ie. is it really this simpleli liAny tipstricksuseful resources apart from the reference documentation regarding bufferscodeasyncorecodeli ol  pCurrently, the data is being read and buffered as followsp  precodedef handlereadself     self.ibuffer  b      while True         self.ibuffer  self.recvself.buffersize         if ByteUtils.endswithcrlfself.ibuffer             self.logger.debugGot full line including CRLF             break         else             self.logger.debugBuffer not full yet s, self.ibuffer      self.logger.debugFilled up the buffer with line     printstrself.ibuffer, encodingUTF8 codepre  pThe codeByteUtils.endswithcrlfcode function simply checks the last two bytes of the buffer for codex0Dx0Acode.

Negative 76120 pFor reference this is the User Profile Properties section of Sharepoint where you can start an import.  Ours is configured to interface with Active Directory.  We have mapped the SPSBirthday field to a custom field in Active Directory since Active Directory doesnt natively store birthdays.  p  pEverytime we try to import a birthday from Active Directory into the SPSBirthday field in Sharepoint it seems to get absolutely nothing.  The SPSBirthday field remains null.  We have tried changing the format of the date in Active Directory, and we are still getting a null value.  p  pWe even created a new Profile Property, but gave it a string datatype, and it was able to import the data from our custom Active Directory field.  I think the issue might have something to do with the DateTime format that is expected in sharepoint for the SPSBirthday field.p

Negative 76120 pIm on to design my Data Access for a new solution i create. That solution though contains Compact Framework Device Application and libraries besides Desktop. All .NET 3.5. Desktop will handle all Data Access basically. I need the Data Objects to have in CF too, Desktop will communicate with SQL and then with Mobile and give the appropriate data...p  pI love LINQ, and more i love LINQ 2 SQL. There is a lot of hype out there and i dont buy internal Microsoft politics about recommending EF.

But i cant wait for months to create a project as every developer in here, i want something now After that said i want to use LINQ 2 SQL, my problem is that i cant just copy the generated dbml and use the generated classes. I dont need the DataContext cause i dont intend to use CRUD or any operations on a database with the Mobile App. i Just want the Objects. Anyone ever came in a situation like this The whole point is not to write all classes representing the tables by hand.

Negative 76120 pIve used the UrlRewriting.Net module for a couple years now without any problems in Windows XP and Windows 2003. I just recently upgraded my home PC to Windows 7 and started developing a new website.p  pThe plan was to use .html extensions and rewrite them to their .aspx counterparts using the UrlRewriting.Net module. Everything strongworks flawlessly in VWD 2008strong, but when I try running it through IIS7 it is a different story.p  pWhen I try to access a page via the .html rewrite I can no longer access Page.User it keeps returning null.  If I hit the page using its .aspx extension, Page.User is correctly populated. I should also mention that I have a LoginView controller in my Master Page and it suffers from the same symptoms When accessing via .html extension it shows the AnonyousTemplate When using .aspx extension it properly shows the LoggedInTemplate. Im guessing the two are related.p  p[Note Ive also tried extensionless URLs and they exhibit the same problem]p  pThe only way Ive gotten it to work is to switch the application pool to Classic, which then requires me to add an ASP.Net ddl handler for the .html extension [otherwise it is handled by the StaticFileHandler and comes up as a 404 error].  However, Id like my web app to run properly for people without having to fiddle around with IIS.p  pSo I am left with several questionsp  ul liDoes anyone have ideas as to why Page.User always equals null for .html  .aspx rewritten pagesli liWhy does it work in VWD 2008, but not IIS7li liWhat changed from IIS6  IIS7 that could have caused thisli liAny other thoughts on workaroundsli ul  p[Note I just tried a .aspx  .aspx rewrite and it did not exhibit the problem.

Negative 76120 pIm trying to figure out how this would be done in practice, so as not to violate the Open Closed principle.p  pSay I have a class called HttpFileDownloader that has one function that takes a url and downloads a file returning the html as a string.  This class implements an IFileDownloader interface which just has the one function.  So all over my code I have references to the IFileDownloader interface and I have my IoC container returning an instance of HttpFileDownloader whenever an IFileDownloader is Resolved.p  pThen after some use, it becomes clear that occasionally the server is too busy at the time and an exception is thrown.  I decide that to get around this, Im going to autoretry 3 times if I get an exception, and wait 5 seconds in between each retry.p  pSo I create HttpFileDownloaderRetrier which has one function that uses HttpFileDownloader in a for loop with max 3 loops, and a 5 second wait between each loop.  So that I can test the retry and wait abilities of the HttpFileDownloadRetrier I have the HttpFileDownloader dependency injected by having the HttpFileDownloaderRetrier constructor take an IFileDownloader.p  pSo now I want all Resolving of IFileDownloader to return the HttpFileDownloaderRetrier.  But if I do that, then HttpFileDownloadRetriers IFileDownloader dependency will get an instance of itself and not of HttpFileDownloader.p  pSo I can see that I could create a new interface for HttpFileDownloader called IFileDownloaderNoRetry, and change HttpFileDownloader to implement that.  But that means Im changing HttpFileDownloader, which violates Open Closed.p  pOr I could implement a new interface for HttpFileDownloaderRetrier called IFileDownloaderRetrier, and then change all my other code to refer to that instead of IFileDownloader.  But again, Im now violating Open Closed in all my other code.p  pSo what am I missing here  How do I wrap an existing implementation downloading with a new layer of implementation retrying and waiting without changing existing codep  pHeres some code if it helpsp  precodepublic interface IFileDownloader    string Downloadstring url   public class HttpFileDownloader  IFileDownloader    public string Downloadstring url        Cut for brevity  downloads file here returns as string     return html      public class HttpFileDownloaderRetrier  IFileDownloader    IFileDownloader fileDownloader    public HttpFileDownloaderRetrierIFileDownloader fileDownloader        this.fileDownloader  fileDownloader       public string Downloadstring url        Exception lastException  null     try 3 shots of pulling a bad URL.

Negative 76120 pI am currently developing a pluginbased system in C which provides a Lua scripting interface, for which I chose to use luabind. Im using Lua 5 and luabind 0.9, both statically linked and compiled with MSVC 8. I am now having trouble binding functions with luabind when they are defined in a derived class, but not its parent class.p  pMore specifically, I have an abstract base class called IPlugin from which all plugin classes inherit. When the plugin manager initialises, it registers that class and its functions like thisp  precodeluabindopenL luabindmoduleL [     luabindclassltIPluginIPlugin     .defstart, IPluginstart ]codepre  pAs it is only known at runtime what effective plugin classes are available, I had to solve loading plugins in a kind of roundabout way. The plugin manager exposes a factory function to Lua, which takes the name of a plugin class and a desired object name. The factory then creates the object, registers the plugins class as inheriting from the IPlugin base class, and immediately calls a function on the created object that registers itself as a global with the Lua state, like thisp  precodevoid PluginExampleregisterLuaObjectluaState L, string aname      luabindglobalsL[aname]  PluginExamplethis codepre  pI initially did this because I had problems with Lua determining the most derived class of the object, as if I register it from the plugin manager it is only known as a subtype of IPlugin and not the specific subtype. Im not sure anymore if this is even necessary though, but it works and the created object is subsequently accessible from Lua under aname.p  pThe problem I have, though, is that functions defined in the derived class, which were not declared at all in the parent class, cannot be used. Virtual functions defined in the base class, such as start above, work fine, and calling them from Lua on the new object runs the respective redefined code from the PluginExample class. But if I add a new function to PluginExample, here for example a function taking no arguments and returning void, and register it like thisp  precodeluabindmoduleL [ luabindclassltPluginExample, IPluginPluginExample     .defluabindconstructorltPluginManager     .deffunc, PluginExamplefunc ]codepre  pcalling func on the new object yields the following Lua runtime errorp  preNo matching overload found, candidates void funcPluginExamplepre  pI am correctly using the  syntax so the self argument is not needed and it seems suddenly Lua cannot determine the derived type of the object anymore. I am sure I am doing something wrong, probably having to do with the twostep binding required by my system architecture, but I cant figure out where. Id much appreciate some help p
Negative 76120 pIm writing a highloaded daemon that should be run on the FreeBSD 8.0 and on Linux as well. The main purpose of daemon is to pass files that are requested by their identifier. Identifier is converted into local filenamefile size via request to db. And then I use sequential codemmapcode calls to pass file blocks with codesendcode.p  pHowever sometimes there are mismatch of filesize in db and filesize on filesystem realsize lt size in db. In this situation Ive sent all real data blocks and when next data block is mapped  mmap returns no errors, just usual address Ive checked errno variable also, its equal to zero after mmap. And when daemon tries to send this block it gets Segmentation Fault.

JRuby is fine with Scalas Strings  because they are Java strings. But if I give it a Scala Int or Long, or one of the other Scala types List, Set, RichString, Array, Symbol or some other custom type.p  pThis seems unnecessarily hacky surely there has got to be a better way of doing RMIDRb interop without having to use JSR223 API.

I could then write a Ruby wrapper class or just monkeypatch Queue to would parse the JSON.p  pIs there any point in carrying on with trying to access DRb from JavaScala Might it just be easier to install a emrealem message queue If so, any suggestions for a lightweight JVMbased MQp

Negative 76120 pI have a project that uses Spring Webflow 2, extensively.  Theres well over 30 flows, each with a nontrivial number of beans.

Negative 76120 pI have recently been prototyping an application using WPF and Client Application Services.  I am trying to use all three features of the Client Application Services  Forms Authenticiation, Role Security, and Client Profile.  I have managed to get everything working, but I feel like my solution is a kludge and want a better way.p  pFor the discussion assume the followingp  pI have two WPF windowsp  pThe first window is my main Application form.  It has two buttons Login and Check Thread Principalp  pThe second window is a login form which implements the IClientFormsAuthenticationCredentialsProvider interface to use the GetCredentials method to return a new ClientFormsAuthenticationCredentials object with the entered username and password.p  pThe application starts, the Main Window is loaded and the user clicks the login button.  In the button click event, a call is made to System.Web.Security.Membership.ValidateUserString.Empty, String.Empty.  This causes the GetCredentials method in my login form to be called which in turns shows the login window.  The code in the button click event of the main window waits until the user enters information in the login window.p  pOnce the user submits the login information, the login form closes, the flow of execution is returned to the main window login click event. If the username and password submitted were valid, the Thread.CurrentPrincipal has the appropriate FormAuthentication Principal. p  pIf we go back to the main window form and click the Check Thread Principal button, and check the Thread.CurrentPrincipal on the button click event, we see that the Thread.CurrentPrincipal is no longer the FormsAuthentication Principal, but instead a Generic Windows Principal.p  pIn my research, Ive found a couple of ways to handle this p  pThe first is to call AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetThreadPrincipalThread.CurrentPrincipal just after the user is validated.  This will ensure that the FormsAuthentication Principal sticks around for the lifetime of the application.  The problem with this is that I cannot set it twice.  So if I call the ClientFormsAuthenticationMembershipProvider.LogOut method, and try to do the login process again.  I get an Default principal object cannot be set twice execption. p  pThe second method, and the method I chose for my prototype is to create a class called UserAuthentication.  In this class is a static property called Current which returns a singleton of type UserAuthentication.  In the UserAuthentication class I maintain my own CurrentPrinipal and Original Principal properties which are of type IPrincipal.  I also have LogIn and LogOut methods which manage the calls to System.Web.Security.Membership.ValidateUserString.Empty, String.Empty and ClientFormsAuthenticationMembershipProvider.LogOut and maintain the state of my encapsulated CurrentPrinipal and Original Principal properties.p  pBy doing this as a singleton, I can still access the IsInRole functionality by calling CommonAssembly.UserAuthentication.Current.CurrentPrincipal.IsInRoleSomeRole.  And I can implement the client profile feature by ensuring that just before I call Properties.Settings.Default.Save, I call System.Threading.Thread.CurrentPrincipal  CommonAssembly.UserAuthentication.Current.CurrentPrincipal.p  pThis works, but I feel like it is a kludge, and in my research I have not been able to find an adequate solution.  I understand that part of the problem is how WPF handles execution context, but I feel like there MUST be a better way.p  pI hope my explaination and inline code examples arent too confusing.  The code required to implement all of this is more than I can put in a post.  p  pFYI. I have seen similar threads on stack overflow, but none really adequately answer the question.  I have also seen client application services implementation examples on the web, but none specifically using nonsilverlight WPF.p  pSo is there a better method that allows me to use Thread.CurrentPrincipal for loginlogout which obviates the need for me to maintain my own Principalp  pI appreciate any help or insight that anyone can provide.p  pKind Regards,p  pBerniep

Negative 76120 pThis is generic to any language in which unit testing is done.p  pMost unit test libraries provide a way to control the order in which unit tests are run. Lets say I have a TestClass that defines twelve tests. Is there any good reason to try controlling the order the twelve tests run in Keep in mind that any startupshutdown code is already taken care of, because most libraries provide a way to do that to. The advantage I see to having an explicit test order is that you can compose your tests so each one uses only functionality that it tests directly or has already been tested by a prior test. The disadvantage is the maintenance cost of keeping the ordering up to date and ensuring that other developers understand why the order is what it is and work to preserve it.p  pIs this just not worth the effortp

Negative 76120 pI have a situation where I need to assign an appropriate rate to an employees timecard.

Negative 76120 pI have a VSTO addin for Word.p  pDeveloped with Visual Studio 2010 for Word 2007 and 2010 and also VS 2008 for Word 2003.p  pIt installs and runs in many different combinations of Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 as well as Office versions i.e. Office 2003, 2007, 2010.p  pExcept for one Word 2010 on Windows XP SP3.p  pThe symptoms are that when Words starts up it appears to load the addin for a while but in the end doesnt and the addin appears in the Inactive Application Addins list.p  pThere is code in the startup of the addin that catches exceptions and reports on them, but that code never gets executed.  So it seems that there is an exception somewhere before the addin even starts executing.p  pThat sounds something like an assembly not being found which makes me think maybe the Office 2010 PIA is not installed, but I tried installing that explicitly and it says its already there which is what is supposed to be the case because Office 2010 is supposed to install it unlike previous Office versions which didnt install it.p  pIt would also be a symptom of something like the code not being trusted, but I have continued using the code trusting mechanism of caspol.exe, which seems OK with all the other mixtures of Office and Windows, so Im guessing its OK with O 2010 and W XP.p  pAnd if it was one my assemblies that was missing, then it would be missing when the addin is installed on other Windows versions, because its the same install regardless of OS.p  pIm stymied.p
Negative 76120 pI manage an internal SharePoint portal Moss 2007 that has webparts, some of which fetch RSS feeds from yahoo news, while others from yahoo finance daily stock market charts, yet another one with current weather from NOAA.

I understand that this an authentication issue but I cant get any help from our IT security folks.p  pThe difference between the server and my workstation is that I login with a magnetic card and authenticate against the domain. The browser my PC uses goes through a proxy that has some exceptions listed including the SharePoint portal. Bypass proxy for local addresses is checked. The sever itself is locked down from any direct or via proxy internet access so the authentication requests have to be coded.p  pI didnt write this code, but it works fine on one server but will not on my SharePoint server. I have diligently compared setting and found that on a server where it is used as a web widget, it works fine. The web site uses impersonation using a domain account.

Negative 76120 pstrongOppsstrong This is the same as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3421932isthereawaytoresettheerrorbadgesinnetbeansIs there a way to reset the error badges in Netbeansa but I dont know how to mark it as such ...p  pMy version of NetBeans 6.9.1 is currently showing a large number of syntax errors in many files, in many projects.p  pBut, if I look at the errors, they are invalid. For example, one error says that an import is referencing a nonexistent file. However, that file exists and has no syntax errors.p  pMore importantly, despite all of the errors, the code compiles cleanly and runs correctly.p  pMy guess is that NetBeans is caching some data OSGi that is out of date or has been corrupted. This has happened before, but in the past it wasnt this bad and it magically cleared itself. p  pIve tried starting and stopping NetBeans, but that doesnt do it. If, as in the above case, I use NetBeans to resave the imported file, it goes away after a minute, but for large projects this is very timeconsuming. Note that I am using jVi, and saving with that embedded editor doesnt not fix the problem, it has to be the NetBeans save command.p  pId really like to find a simple way just to force the whole internal state to refresh itself.

Negative 76120 pI am considering using SLF4j to integrate multiple logging frameworks.p  pThe a hrefhttpdownload.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavautilloggingLogger.html relnofollowjava.util.logging.Loggera class has a nice method called setLevelLevel newLevel. It enables logging configuration at a class level, which helps creating readable and lean traces.p  pI could not find the equivalent in the SLF4J framework. Is there any  The SLF4J Logger interface does not offer such a method. I have seen the other questions on StackOverflow and I have read the SL4F doc, but I could not come to a definitive conclusion.p  pIf SLF4J does not allow the finetuning I am looking for, then what is the real benefit of SLF4J It seems to strip the interesting features of binding frameworks into a most common weak and useless denominator...p  pIf so, why shouldnt I convert all my code to my favorite Logging framework instead of going for SLF4Jp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOk, may be I am selfish in complaining about SLF4J not answering emmyem hopes here. Yet, I still dont see much value in using SLF4j to integrate logging frameworks, because in the process, one looses access to very interesting features of those binding frameworks. The only positive addition I can see is the deferred creation of objects for log record message printing.p  pSLF4J is IMHO surely not a best of many worlds, it is a minimal common denominator and that minimal is strongtoostrong low for proper software engineering. On the other side, existing logging frameworks are quite overengineered and often miss key features offered by competitors.p  pIf one needs to integrate logging frameworks, I see two options with strongrealstrong practical value i Pick your favorite logging framework and convert all your code to this framework or ii Create your own framework it is dead easy, it only took me a couple of hours.p  pMy 2 cents. I have no issue with people having a different opinion. Just stating mine from my practical experience.p

Only one 2560 bytes write request is sent from my driver.p  pOnce this write is serviced, an interrupt is generated which is intercepted by codedoIRQcode. Finally, the function codeblkcompleterequestcode is called. Keep in mind that we are still in the top half of the interrupt handler i.e., interrupt context, strongnotstrong kernel context. Now, we compose another codestruct biocode in codeblkcompleterequestcode and call the codemakerequestcode function of the lower level driver. We record a timestamp at this point say codeT0code. When the request completion callback is obtained, we record another timestamp call it codeT1code. The difference  codeT1  T0code  is strongalwaysstrong above 1 millisec. This experiment was repeated numerous times, and each time, the destination sector affected this difference  codeT1  T0code. It was observed that if the destination sectors are separated by approximately 350 sectors, the time difference is about 1.2 millisec for requests of size 2560 bytes.p  pEvery time, the next write request is sent only when the previous request has been serviced. So, all these requests are emchainedem and the disk has to service only one request at a time.p  pMy understanding is that since the destination sectors of consecutive requests have been separated by a fairly large amount, by the time the next request is issued, the requested sector would be almost below the disk head and thus the write should happen immediately and codeT1  T0code should be small at least lt 1 millisec.p  pThe Serial ATA AHCI 1.3 Specification page 114 states thatp  blockquote   pWhen a software specified number of commands have completed or stronga software specified   timeout has expiredstrong, an interrupt is generated by hardware to allow software to process completed commands.p blockquote  pMy guess is that this timer maybe the reason why the latency of each request is above 1 millisec. Thats why I need to disable CCC.p  pI did mail the author  Jeff Garzik  but I havent heard from him yet.

Negative 76120 pI have some code and data, both currently encapsulated within a struct, which in turn is within a namespace. Im trying to integrate an external library, which makes use of oldfashioned callbacks. I need access to my data within the context of the callback, but the callback API provides no means of adding personalized parameters.p  pThe only way I know to circumvent this is to either add a global pointer to my struct, so that the callback knows where to find the data, or use a tangle of boost classes to create a fake function pointer from my struct for the callback to use. Both options feel more like hacking around OOP limitations than actual solutions.p  pSo, Im debating whether or not to ditch the struct completely, and convert it to freestanding code and data. Essentially, the data would become global or more likely, wrapped within a global struct, but would be within the confines of its namespace.p  pJustification for making the data globalp  ul liThe code has a single purpose in the program, and always uses the same set of data for the life of the program. The data is never allocated or freed.li liThis code and data are never instanced. There never are and never will be multiple copies.li liI have no love for OOP I use C because it is the best tool for the job, so I dont feel the need to keep it encapsulated on principle alone.li ul  pHowever, there is one downside that I would like to avoidp  ul liEven though the data is in a separate namespace and ignoring the fact that I am the only person writing this program, there is nothing to prevent other parts of the program from accessing this data. And if it were to happen, I will have no easy way to track it.li ul  pThe only idea Ive had so far is to wrap the global data within an unnamed namespace. This should, for all intents and purposes, make it invisible to the rest of the code base, and remove the most common reason for not using globals. However, it also means that the code that emdoesem need to access it must all be contained within a single file, which could become a pain to work with if that file gets large.p  pIs there another option Im not thinking of, or is this as good as it getsp

Negative 76120 pIm trying to write an application that reads data from a View and uses a controller to communicate put  get data from a channel with an EventMachine instance.p  pThe design I have right now is that I will persist the EventMachine reactor and a dictionary  that contains the ID for the event machine loop and references to the channel inout. The event loop will connect to an IRC server and getsend requests driven by the front end.p  pCurrently I have a view that will post to a controller that references a fixed event machine myeventmachine and a dictionary of connections connections that I defined in an initializer. The problem now seems to be that the controllerview are disposed after a single execution so I cannot store connection state in it or can I.p  pThe whole idea of having something global in the application is making me cringe though, so I wonder if theres a better, more rails like way of persisting that information. This is my first railsruby project so Im a bit lost here. Most of the information I found deals with how to use the asynchronous nature of EventMachine, and not how to persist the reactorchannels across many instances of the viewcontroller.p

Negative 76120 pIm trying to performance optimize a page load in GAE, and Im a bit stumped what is taking so long to serve the page.p  pWhen I first got appstats running I found the page was calling about 500600 RPC calls. Ive now got that down to 3.p  pHowever, Im still seeing a massive load of extra time in App Stats. Another page on my site using the same django framework  templating loads in about 60ms, doing a small query to a small data set.p  pQuestion is, what is this overhead, and where should I be looking for trouble pointsp  pThe data in the request has about 350 records, and about 30 properties per record. Im cool with the data call itself taking the datastore api time, but its the other time Im confused about. The data does get stepped through a biggish iterator, and Ive now used fetch on most of these requests to keep the RPC call down, and make sure things are in memory rather than being queried as they go.p  pSlow Request  Look at all the extra bluep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCXKYk.png altSlow Requestp  pFast Request , RPC blue is matched against overall bluep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com22RvD.png altFast Requestp  pEDITp  pOK, so I have created a new model called FastModel, and copied the bare minimum items needed for the page to it, so it can load as quickly as possible, and it does make a big difference.

Negative 76120 pWhen running on a touchscreen device iPhone, in my case, but I presume it does this on others, when the virtual keyboard pops up for a form field, there are added navigation buttons at the top of the keyboard previous, next, done.

Its a touch device. You touch what you want to change. Theres no need for navigation buttonsp  pI suppose users may be familiar with this, IF they use their device often to fill forms on websites. Ive had an iPhone since the 3G, and never noticed this.

Negative 76120 pIm trying to setup a server that provides truerandom number from a device, codeQuantis  Quantum Random Number Generatorcode. I built the web application with the Grails framework, running on codeTomcatcode server on codeUbuntucode.p  pSince theres only 1 device, I have to schedule the threads that accesses it, correct So I set semaphores with 1 resource on the functions codeReadInt, ReadDouble, ReadFloatcode that call this device. The object that contains these functions is called codeQuantiscode stored in the Java Source Packages for the Grails app, its implemented as a singleton the controllers will then call and instance of this object and its functions. Then each of those function will call the Quantis Library on the system to read the stream from the device lt now this is the critical zone.

After that my application analyses created EMF files and extracts text information.br Here is the problem often if customer prints PDF file text information is missing in generated EMF file because PDF printing software replaces nonascii characters with their graphic representation.br To solve this problem i consider several ways. One of the ways is to extract text directly from source PDF file. But customers software is not able to put source PDF file to specified directory. It can only print PDF file to selected windows printer.br So my question is it possible to create virtual printer driver which will just store original PDF file to some directoryp

Negative 76120 pI am following the Linux Device Drivers. When it introduces spinlocks, it gives the following examplep  blockquote   pYour driver is executing and has just taken out a lock that controls access to its device. While the lock is held, the device issues an interrupt, which causes your interrupt handler to run. The interrupt handler, before accessing the device, must also obtain the lock. Taking out a spinlock in an interrupt handler is a legitimate thing to do that is one of the reasons that spinlock operations do not sleep. But what happens if the interrupt routine executes in the same processor as the code that took out the lock originally strongWhile the interrupt handler is spinning, the noninterrupt code will not be able to run to release the lockstrong. That processor will spin forever.p blockquote  pI dont understand why if the interrupt handler is spinning, the noninterrupt code cannot be executed. p  pIs it because the routine in the interrupt handler cannot be preempted If so, is that to say the interrupt routine must be atomicp

It seems that during reflection it finds a getter for a Serializable, but not a Long and it does not find a setter for the Serializable.  It does not do this consistently, so I suspect that calling person.getClass.getDeclaredMethodid will not always return the same Method, but I could be wrong about that.p  pAnyway, this inconsistent behavior is really maddening because, for example, it will work in Eclipse, but not in Maven, or it will work for a long time and then with some unrelated change somewhere else it will stop working.p  pClearly I dont understand generics well enough to understand what is happening, but can anyone explain it to me and also explain how to work around itp

Negative 76120 pI know this is a kind of multipronged question, but Im about to embark on a WebGL 2D game, and in the future I would like to port it to IOS and android. Ive got a little OpenGL experience but I would rather use an established 2d WebGL Library from the start, so does anyone have any experience with these and do you know what approach will be easiest to port to IOSAndroid in the futurep  pIm aware webGL isnt currently supported by IOS so perhaps the process of porting it will require rewriting all the non openGL code, which is why Im wondering if any WebGL libraries were built with this in mind..p  pIm also away IOS will probably in the future support WebGL so perhaps I should consider this a mute point and just assume that it will be supported before Im ready to port anyway..p  pAny resources that might help me get started on the venture are also very welcomep  pThanksp  pTLDR strongWhats a good 2D WebGL library that will save me heartache in the longrun porting to other devicesstrongp

Negative 76120 pIm writing some form views in my Rails 3 app, and I am wondering what others out there might be doing to validate forms on the front end and backend in a DRY way.p  pOf course, it seems there is no way to get around validating on the back end without rails validations. Knowing that, it doesnt seem very DRY to be writing the same validations on the front end. Ive read some other threads about writing validations in 2 places, but unless there is a really good reason to do that, Id rather not.p  pKnowing the magic of rails, there is probably a simple, easy way to validate both front in and back end in a DRY way, but I have yet to discover it. Perhaps a validation gemp  pSo Im thinking that it would be good to use ajax on my front end that calls a validator method on my User model. For example, my username field on the client end listens for jquery keypresses then sends the field contents to my user controller method called checkuser or something like that. Given that there are 5 or more fields per model, I may end up with a lot of extra fieldchecking methods in my controllers... too uglyp  pWould there be any caveats I should know about doing it this way Should I really be concerned about those who disable javascript p

Negative 76120 pstrongWhere should dynamic binding logic be placed when developing new language with DLRstrong p  pAs far as I know, there are two possible places to implement late binding. One is in binder and the other is in DynamicMetaObject subclass. p  pMy current implementation uses binders only to identify type of operation, to cary some custom data and to throw exception in fallback method. Actual binding is done in DynamicMetaObject. p  pIs there a suggestion for what goes where in DLR world p  pstrongWhen to create DynamicMetaObjectstrongp  pEvery impelmentation of codeIDynamicMetaObjectProvidercode that Ive seen every time when binding is needed creates new instance of DynamicMetaObject subclass and returns it. This seem a bit odd to me. For example, I have wrapper around Int32 in my language and when I execute something like thisp  precode11 11 codepre  pthere are 6 new DynamicMetaObjects created  one for each operand and one for each result. In my case, there is only one instance of int with same value in this example, only one instance of wrapper around int with value 1, so it doesnt seem right to have 4 instances of DynamicMetaObject. p  pIs there a way to use same codeDynamicMetaObjectcode for the same instance always I tried to create DynamicMetaObject once and then return same instance in codeGetMetaObjectcode method, but all i got was an error codeAn IDynamicMetaObjectProvider created invalid DynamicMetaObject instance.codep  pAlso, BindingRestriction parameter in DynamicMetaObject constructor doesnt seem to have effect when creating subclass I hoped that DLR will cache instance of DynamicMetaObject based on binding restrictions.  Is there a way to cache MO for instance or, idealy for typep

Negative 76120 pIve got a Prolog program where Im doing some brute force search on all strings up to a certain length. Im checking which strings match a certain pattern, keeping adding patterns until hopefully I find a set of patterns that covers all strings. I would like to store which ones to a file which dont match any of my patterns, so that when I add a new pattern, I only need to check the leftovers, instead of doing the entire brute force search again.p  pIf I were writing this in python, I would just pickle the list of strings, and load it from the file. Does anybody know how to do something similar in Prologp  pI have a good amount of Prolog programming experience, but very little with Prolog IO. I could probably write a predicate to read a file and parse it into a term, but I figured there might be a way to do it more easily.p

Negative 76120 pIm experiencing some problems with my understanding of the java compiler.p  pIf you know Minecraft you may know that there are many mods to the game, which are pieces of modified classes that are injected into the original .jar replacing the old original .class, the problem is that if you want to use 2 different mods that replace the same .class, this would be kinda impossible, unless you blend in the code of both of them and do some edition.p  pWell, I got the 2 mods that uses the same .class and decompiled both of the classes the decompilation were SUCCESSFUL, analyzed, modified and created a .java file that works for both mods at the same time. My problem now is that I have to recompile this .java into a .class file so I can inject into the minecraft .jar, but every time I try to compile it, I get a lot of errors, such as codeclass, interface, or enum expectedcode and codeselection does not contain main typecode those errors were expected, because the code mentions a lot of external classes and does not contain main type really.p  pId like to know if any of you know anyway to kinda translate the .java to a .class binary file ignoring all the errors Ive got due to what was mentioned before or if you have any other suggestion about how can I do it.p  pPS This code is not a full program, thats why I got those errors, it would work perfectly when inside the .jar, please dont answer that its pointless compile this file alone.p

Negative 76120 pNot sure if Im using the right terminology so this question may already be answered somewhere on stackoverflow if so, please let me know. Is there a way to designate multiple gravity points in a d3.js graph where the gravity point is one node with a fixed x,y value in each cluster For example, Im using the code from a hrefhttpbl.ocks.org2920551 relnofollowthis examplea to display clusters. The only difference in what my graphs will look like is that the nodes will have links to each other possibly to nodes in other clusters as well. I want to make sure the other clusters overlap as little as possible and still show any links between each cluster.p  pIve tried force.gravity0.1 with force.charge10. That seems to keep the clusters apart but the betweencluster distance continues to decrease as gravity increase because there is only one gravity point located in the middle of the graph by default.p

Negative 76120 pUsers can select from up to three dimensions of product data to choose the product they want. For example, for a pair of pants I might knowp  precodecolors  [red, blue, soylent green] waists  [28W, 30W, omg random description, 32W]  The values are not always numeric lengths  [26L, 27L, 28L, 29L] codepre  pRepresented in the DOM asp  precodeltul classcolorsgt   ltligtltbutton namered valueredgtltligt   ltligtltbutton nameblue valuebluegtltligt    ltulgt ltul classwaistsgt   ltligtltbutton name28W value28Wgtltligt   ltligtltbutton name30W value30Wgtltligt    ltulgt lt you get the picture gt codepre  pWe also know that you cant get every combination of color, waist and length. When a partial configuration is chosen, we mark up the HTML to indicate what configurations are available given that choice. The data that gives me the available combinations must be delivered as JSON, and it must deliver the emskuem string of the productconfiguration, but it can take any form that makes sense. What form should it takep  pIve experimented with a 3dimensional array where defined values are skus and codenullcode or undefined values are unavailable configurationsp  precode[  Arrays of colors   [  Arrays of waists     [  Array of lengths       sku1, sku2, sku3, null, sku4     ], [       skuabc, null, skudef     ]   ], [     [  ],    ]  ] codepre  pThis is the most compact, but leads to slow, unreadable code. When the customer hovers over a waist size button, I have to find the indices of that value in the waists array and eliminate all the other dimensions of waist, then get the indices of codenullcode values and mark them as unavailable. There are a lot of codeforcode loops here.p  pAnother approach I tried was with a nested object. Unavailable combinations are simply undefinedp  precode   red      28W        28L sku123,       30L sku456   codepre  pBut if the user hovers over, say, code28Lcode, I have to iterate through all the outer objects to find those that emdontem have a property of code28Lcode.p  pIf I just needed to know which configurations were unavailable, I could make a list of those configurations, but since I also need the codeskucode, its become complex. What data structure do you makes the best tradeoffs between size and speed and readable code, if possible, keeping in mind it will be run clientsidep

Negative 76120 pI have a general question about a threads and callbacks. Say for example we have a thread running continuously along with a main program. The main program has registered a callback function with the thread. So the thread can call the callback function at anytime.  Generally we register a callback by passing a function pointer to the thread.I want to know when a that callback function is called by the thread , will it be a part of that thread or, will it be part of the main program. I want to know the mechanism of this process like how the main program execution is stopped or interrupted when the callback is called by the thread.Other thing is how will the function call stack behave when callback is called.p  pThanks  Sanjay   p

Its great but I hate having to traverse through the file tabs which are usually hidden because I have so many files opened at once. I would ideally want something that will allow me to group these opened files almost like a folder structure where I can create a category for grouping the opened files together so as keep things that are related to one another close by.p  pFailing this please recommend what is the best approach when dealing with lots and lots of opened files.p  pI like how browser works because it allows me to open multiple instances and let me group the sites I want via tabs to each browser instance. Dreamweaver wont allow more than one instance. Is there anything out there that can do thisp

Negative 76120 pWe have a servlet that accepts requests and performs certain actions on external systems.  Many times these external systems respond slowly and the requests take longer than 60 seconds.  In the log we notice that exactly after 60 seconds a new request is made to the servlet with the same post parameters as long as the client is still connected.p  pGoogling found that the same is reported on other App Servers such as Glassfish etc.  The reason seems to be that after a timeout of 60 seconds the servlet or the web container are timing out the call and repeating the request.  Note that this seems to be a servlet or container initiated refresh and not really posted from the client.  Way to avoid this is to apparently increase the timeout.

Negative 76120 pI have been working on an application for a couple of years that I updated using a backend database.

Negative 76120 pIm using the GoogleDrive ObjectiveC SDK, and Im running into an issue.  I want to build up a path  ID mapping structure, so I ask Drive for a list of all of a users files.  Normally this works fine.  But, in cases where users have very large amounts of files, the server returns an internal error.  I can fix this by setting the maxResults property on my GTLQueryDrive to a lower number.  When I do that, everything works as expected, EXCEPT that the nextPageToken and nextLink property of the GTLDriveFileList is nil.  I believe I need this nextPageToken to continue grabbing file information.  I have tried setting the fields property on my query to nil, to a string that includes nextPageToken, and to a string that does not include nextPageToken.  The nextPageToken property appears to be nil in all cases.  Is there something I am missing  Thanksp

Negative 76120 pstrongShort versionstrong  Disabling hardware acceleration with androidhardwareAcceleratedfalse in xml changes the background color of my Theme.Sherlock.Light.DarkActionBar theme to a whiter white. emEDIT this used to be the main question. I changed the title to emphasize the second problem.emp  pDisabling hardware acceleration for the mapView only, causes constant redraws.p  pstrongLong versionstrongp  pAFAIK hardware acceleration is enabled by default on API level 14 and up. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11460958canvasnotdisplayingalldrawnpartsincustomviewreferenceap  pSince Im building and testing for API level 16, my hardware acceleration was usually on so thats what I was used to seeing. The theme is light but not quite pure white, its a light grey default.p  pI had some circle overlays being drawn on a map and when I zoomed in close, the mapview was becoming very laggy and I was getting a shape too large to be rendered into a texture error in logcat. I discovered that turning hardware acceleration off fixes the problem. p  pWhen I turn hardware acceleration off for the application or an individual activity in the android manifest, the background color of my layouts changes. It goes from a light grey to a very very light grey, almost pure white.

Negative 76120 pI would like to sample values, but have a constraint in place that demands two values are at least codewindowcode apart.

Negative 76120 pIs there some way to intercept text when it is typed in a text field and replace it with something else before it appearsp  pIm developing a Flash game for learning French and I want to allow users to type accents on a US keyboard. On the French keyboard, the  is produced by the 2 key.

Ive tried using keydown, keyup, textinput events, tweaking things a dozen different ways, but with no success I dont seem to be able to change the event properties, just read them.p  pI also tried stopping event propagation and inserting the accented characters manually. This works fine in normal use using codeappendTextcode, for example, but reproducing all the behavior of a text field would be too much coding inserting at the cursor, not just at the end replacing any selected text, and so on.p  pThe best Ive come up with so far is to add a replace function to a keyup handler along the lines of codetext.replace2, code. The problem with this is that the user can see the number 2 for half a second before it is replaced by the accented character in other words it looks amateurish. I would like the characters to just appear, as if they were using a French keyboard.p  pId be grateful for any ideas.p

Negative 76120 pIm not sure this is possible but heres my scenario I have this tableView with 3 sections. If you touch the white star in the 3rd section on accessoriesImage, it will insert that row to the Favorites section, just like accessories.sku. That works just fine.p  pNow, when you add rows to Favorites the Favorites section grows larger and pushes the third section down the screen. I understand that it obviously needs to do this when adding rows to section two. However, that last section has 400 rows in it and you can very quickly scroll the top two sections off the screen, its here that I want to stop scrolling. p  pWhat happens is, you scroll down looking at the rows in section 3 and the top two sections are way off the visible screen. Then you touch the star on a row to add a new favorite, this triggers that row to be inserted into section 2, the favorites section. But it also pushes down your current view down by one row when it does that insertion. I understand when the Favorites section is visible that this would be unavoidable, but when that section is off the screen I dont want to see my rows get pushed down because of the insertion.p  pThe second image below may help explain that more. Here, weve scrolled way down the screen. If I click a star to add a favorite, it inserts a row way up in section 2 and pushes the rows you see in that image down one row. I just want to keep those rows in place when it does the insertion above.p  pId love to hear your ideas.

Negative 76120 pIm trying to implement my own UITextInput however Im having trouble updating the position using the cursor key on a Bluetooth keyboard. Im trying to create a TextInput that loops, if you imagine the characters being numbered like thisp  precode1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 codepre  pThen pressing up at position 2, should take you to position 8 pressing left on 6 takes you to 4 etc. iOS seems to call positionFromPositioninDirectionoffset to figure how where to move from the current position. It then calls setSelectedTextRange to update the cursor position.p  pThis is fine so far, but it seem that sometimes iOS DOESNT call positionFromPositioninDirectionoffset for example if I press Up and then Down again, iOS appears to cache the previous position and just call setSelectedTextRange with that previous value. I dont understand this, is there a way of telling iOS that the selected position has changed and it should clear its cache, i.e. if someone presses a clear button or somethingp  pThe caching ONLY seems to occur for Up and Down cursor key presses, moving left and right never caches previous values and positionFromPositioninDirectionoffset is always called. Even if I dont consider the possibility of something reseting the cursor position I still have issues with positionFromPositioninDirectionoffset not being called occasionally, and I just keep getting setSelectedTextRange set to the same value by iOS. So if feels like theres something Ive misunderstood about how iOS is caching cursor movement. Can anyone help me outp

Negative 76120 pSuppose I have the following classp  precodetemplate ltclass T, class U, class Vgt Foo      ...  codepre  pThe template parameters have a distinct mapping, so I can deduce the other template arguments U and V based on what T is.

Negative 76120 pI am trying to implement in app billing in my android app. In my app i am trying to sell digital goods which are backed up by sqlite. I want that when a user purchases my app, some extra say 100 entries get added to my sqlite tables that are already created in the app. What is the way to do this. Is it possible that I create the whole database with all the entries including the ones i am trying to sell, and hide the paid entries. Then when the user pays for those entries, i unhide them. If i do something like this... is my application more likely to be easily hacked How can this be implemented. The in app billing version 3 documentation by google is very confusing.

Negative 76120 pI am currently working on a EJB 3.1 based project running on GlassFish that uses a custom built framework to configure the functionality of any SessionBeans.

I would like to set the selector a MDB is using based upon the configuration information and reconfigure this if the settings change. p  pUnfortunately I could only come up with a SessionBean that creates MessageConsumers natively on the JMS Sessions based upon the configuration and to have the JMS messages handleb by MessageListeners, but I was told this way we would be loosing concurrency and the transaction handling of the EJB system, as we would no longer be using MDBs this way.p  pSo is there any way to do what Im looking for using MDBs Someone told me there are some planned extensions in new EJB and JMS spec drafts, but I coulnt find a pointer to that particular topic.p

Intuitively, Im sure everyone would start from the top of the imaginary grid in this case, then analyze the problem first evaluating the rows as linear sets.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comp7a7J.gif altJust a regular sequence.p  pChange would be the difference between two elements.

How did I come up with the answer  Was my brain doing a special operation  If so, what is the operation  Without looking at every row and column, only choosing one linear set, how am I finding a relationship between the three numbers  Is there a way to make an accurate strongguessstrong of what the relationship between each element is  If not, is there a minimum number of elements that need to be present in order to make an adequate attempt at concluding a likely patternp  pI understand that computers are being forced to go through this process as they learn in unsupervised fashion, and I know that the field of artificial intelligence is relatively new and underdeveloped, so Im not expecting absolute answers.  Im moreso asking for a good approach if finding a pattern from three elements of a linear set is possible.  Perhaps, by asking this question, Ill gather relevent search queries of considerable specificity. p

Negative 76120 pI am a hrefhttpdocs.angularjs.orgguideconcepts relnofollowtrying to understanda the scope and how controller and view are clued together. When Angular first runs through the DOM elements, when it finds ngcontroller what does it do I know when it finds the binding variables, it creates either watch or keydown events and also for the events it injects itself and watch for the other related events. It is done by creating a scope for that given DOM element. so when an item changes in view or model it can push the value to proper places. My question is when does controller is instantiated and scope get injected into it and how scope calls associated methods when a event happens Thanksp

Negative 76120 pstrongBackground  Batch unfaultingstrongbr NSFetchRequest allows batch unfault  for example, use a query of 1000 results, it would bring all as faults, then it would unfault X objects at a time i.e. index 020, then 2140, etcp  pThis behavior is great when used in NSFetchResultsController for a UITableViewDataSource, and it allows fast UI scrolling as it doesnt unfault objects onebyone.p  pstrongNow to my problembrstrong Im using ordered relationships for lists of objects, lets say emPostsem.p  pSince a emPostem may appear on a lot of lists on my model, I cant store its index in every lists on emPostem entity and use it as a param for ordering results.p  pAs for now, I havent found a way for NSFetchRequest to fetch according to this order, so I cant use its batch unfaulting. So Im addressing to the relationship with an index, and I end up unfaulting onebyone, which causes bumpy scrolling.p  pIs there any way for NSFetchResultsController to fetch according to order relationships Or, is there a batch unfaulting API which isnt privatep
Negative 76120 pIm brandspanking new to PHP, so please be gentle.p  pIm trying to create a dynamicallypopulated page navigation for a frequentlyupdated site. I thought Id use something like codeGLOBONLYDIRcode or codeisdircode all the pages Im looking for will be in their own directories to generate an array that the navigation can build itself from, but from what Ive read frequent calls to the server like that scanning up to fifty directories, creating the array on every page visited, and who knows how many site visitors can be taxing on the server.p  pIs this true Id like to avoid using an XML for the directory, but does calling php that often create a memory drain on what is admittedly already a memoryheavy site  lots of motion graphics, transparencies, javascript animation, etc, or should it be no more a drain than your usual php page generationp  pThanks, gyzp

Negative 76120 pI am developing an android application which opens a video stream, using the class org.opencv.android.JavaCameraView offered by the opencv libraries, and captures frames from it, in order to process them before they are shown on the screen.p  pThe application is organized in this wayp  ol lipa main thread, which has the OnCameraFrame method, that acquires frame and send it to the thread A, and this method is also responsible for displaying the final frame on screen. So all the processing should be performed after the frame has been acquired, and before it is shown on screen,in the middle of this method.pli lipthe thread A, which saves the frame acquired into a buffer, a BlockingLinkedQueuepli lipthe thread B, which takes a frame from the buffer, and send it to the thread responsible for the processing, the thread Cpli lipthe thread C, which process the frame, and send it to the main thread.pli ol  pSo the question is how can I block the method OnCameraFrame, so it cant show any frame on the screen, until it has been returned from the last thread C If I dont implement any thing of this type, because of the processing requires a bit of time, I dont see the final frame correctly on the screen.p  pI hope I have been clear in explaining my problem.p

Negative 76120 pIm developing a Windows Service that will run every 15 minutes, and sends out push notifications to iOS, Android, and BlackBerry users. Each of these device specific operations will run in separate threads in the Windows service. Thats all well and good, but there is a chance that we will need to send out up to 50,000 push notifications at a time. If this happens, it could possibly take more than 15 minutes, so before its time for the next service to run, I want to know if the previous process has finished, and if it hasnt, wait and queue the Windows service to execute once the prior execution is complete. Im fine with the threading aspect, but I dont know the correct way to implement the scenario that Ive described above. Is there some sort of Wait or Queue mechanism in C p

Negative 76120 pI have a script that receives all kinds of different data arrays from a web based API.  That program returns all dates in the ISO 8601 format 20130812T0900000000600.

The site will use Facebook for user authentication and for retrieving initial profile data.p  pFor the authentication system I am using the new OWIN based ASP.NET Identity engine a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combwebdevarchive20130703understandingowinformsauthenticationinmvc5.aspxhttpblogs.msdn.combwebdevarchive20130703understandingowinformsauthenticationinmvc5.aspxa, since it greatly simplifies the process of authenticating with external providers.p  pThe problem is that once a user first logs in, I want to get its email address from the Facebook profile, but this data is not included in the generated claims. So I have thought on these alternatives to get the addressp  ol lipInstruct the ASP.NET Identity engine to include the email address in the set of data that is retrieved from Facebook and then converted to claims. I dont know if this is possible at all.pli lipUse the Facebook graph API a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsgettingstartedgraphapihttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsgettingstartedgraphapia to retrieve the email address by using the Facebook user id which is included in the claims data. But this will not work if the user has set his email address as private.pli lipUse the Facebook graph API, but specifying me instead of the Facebook user id a hrefhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsreferenceapiuserhttpsdevelopers.facebook.comdocsreferenceapiusera. But an access token is required, and I dont know how to or if its possible at all retrieve the access token that ASP.NET uses to obtain the user data.pli ol  pSo the question isp  ol lipHow can I instruct the ASP.NET Identity engine to retrieve additional information from Facebook and include it in the claims datapli lipOr alternatively, how can I retrieve the generated access token so that I can ask Facebook myselfpli ol  pThank youp  pNote for the authentication system my application uses code based on the sample project linked in this SO answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma184234744574httpstackoverflow.coma184234744574ap

Adapted from the link httpwiki.apache.orghadoopWordCount Hadoop wiki.   public class WordCount        Mapper for word count.             The base class Mapper is parameterized by       ltin key type, in value type, out key type, out value typegt.             Thus, this mapper takes Text key, Text value pairs and outputs       Text key, LongWritable value pairs. The input keys are assumed       to be identifiers for documents, which are ignored, and the values       to be the content of documents. The output keys are words found       within each document, and the output values are the number of times       a word appeared within a document.             To support efficient serialization conversion of data to and from       formats suitable for transport, Hadoop typically does not use the       builtin Java classes like String and Long as key or value types. The       wrappers Text and LongWritable implement Hadoops serialization       interface called Writable and, unlike Javas String and Long, are       mutable.           public static class WordCountMap extends MapperltText, Text, Text, LongWritablegt           Regex pattern to find words alphanumeric  .          final static Pattern WORDPATTERN  Pattern.compilew           Constant 1 as a LongWritable value.          private final static LongWritable ONE  new LongWritable1L           Text object to store a word to write to output.          private Text word  new Text           Actual map function.

Like the Mapper base class, the base class Reducer is parameterized by        ltin key type, in value type, out key type, out value typegt.             For each Text key, which represents a word, this reducer gets a list of       LongWritable values, computes the sum of those values, and the keyvalue       pair word, sum.           public static class SumReduce extends ReducerltText, LongWritable, Text, LongWritablegt           Actual reduce function.                      param key Word.           param values Iterator over the values for this key.           param context ReducerContext object for accessing output,                          configuration information, etc.                   public void reduceText key, IteratorltLongWritablegt values,                 Context context throws IOException, InterruptedException              long sum  0L             while values.hasNext                  sum  values.next.get                          context.writekey, new LongWritablesum                     Entrypoint for our program.

Negative 76120 pWeve been pulling our hair out just trying to just trying to get a basic example of the XSLT replace function to work.p  pstrongIm leaving this text in tact for context, but you may want to skip to the updatestrongp  pWere using a hrefhttpwww.mirthcorp.com relnofollowMirtha to pull in HL7 messages.  Were unsure whether this supports XSLT version 2, but we believe it uses SAXON  a hrefhttpsaxon.sourceforge.net relnofollowhttpsaxon.sourceforge.neta, which purportedly does support XSLT2 and hence the replace function.p  pIn any case, we tried using a hrefhttpwww.xsltcake.com relnofollowXSLTCakea to try and get even a demo replacement to work, to no avail. Weve seen this either referenced as codereplacecode or codefnreplacecode as well as a couple other suggestions using other libraries. p  pIf XSLT2 isnt supported by a hrefhttpwww.mirthcorp.com relnofollowMirtha, we would need a workaround for XSLT1.  We found one here  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3067113xsltstringreplaceXSLT string replacea   but have been unable to get this to work either.p  pThis is a tough to get down to a single question as Im asking alot, but here goes...

Negative 76120 pThis isnt really a question about some code I have not working, but rather Im looking for guidance on how to solve a problem. Given any programming or scripting language with which youre familiar, how would you solve this problemp  pYou are given two sets of data a JSON object that is retrieved from a remote system on a nightly basis, and a MySQL database that keeps track of the data within that JSON object. The JSON object may contain hundreds of records and the database tracks all of those individual records and also tracks any changes to those records. The order of the records within the JSON object also occasionally change. Each record has a UID associated with it in both the JSON object and in the MySQL database. p  pOccasionally, however, a record is deleted on this remote system. The JSON does not reflect this deletion by marking it as deleted or inactive in the object. Instead, this record is simply missing.p  pWhat is the best way to detect that there is a missing record, and precisely which record is missing, considering the fact that the ordering of the records in the JSON object may change nighttonightp  pemeditem p  pSomeone asked me what the application is. Im a software developer at a university. I receive a nightly dump of student schedule data JSON. I want to track changes in the schedule data and notify the students of changes in the schedule.p  pThe MySQL database keeps a record of all of the events ever in the schedule, and it is currently around 10,000 records large.p  pemedit 2emp  pEssentially, given a master database and comparing it to a subset of that database, Im looking for items missing from the subset.p

Negative 76120 pI am developing the WPF component of an MvvmCross application suite. I am seriously loving MvvmCross and can see that it is making cross platform development a lot easier.p  pThe issue I am seeing is when I use the SQLite plugins and run the WPF code as Any CPU then it is failing to load the native sqlite3.dll with a BadImageFormatException. If I select x86 or Prefers 32bit then it works fine in 32bit mode. However, in the WPF project I am using a COM component that needs to be loading in 64bit mode on 64bit machines and 32bit mode on 32bit machines. Mixing messes up the com component.p  pThus, is it possible to run MvvmCross in 64bit mode when SQLite is used.p  pWould I have to use System.Data.Sqlite instead and does this play nice with MvvmCrossp
Negative 76120 pI have been writing code to get all the possible cycles in a directed graph. a hrefhttpwww.geeksforgeeks.orgdetectcycleinagraph relnofollowHerea is an implementation that keeps track of back edges and whenever one back edge is found, it return true that one cycle is detected. I extended this to the following calculate all the possible back edges in a tree, the number of back edges should give the number of cycles. Not sure if this correct. using this, I implemented the following The codecountcode variable below is not useful. Initially I had it to give the count of each cycles. but that does not give the correct answer. but the size of codeedgeMapcode that stores all the back edges seems to give the correct number of cycles in some graphs but not all.p  pThe code works for G2 an G3 in the picture, but fails for G1.

Negative 76120 pHere goes a difficult one for the expert Numpyerp  pDoes someone know or can come up with a way to use pure Numpy arrays and functions to draw as well as fill colored polygons on top of a numpy array grid p  pThis I think would take two stepsp  ol liThe ability to fill the grid array with color values so that the polygon filling could be written in one color, and the outline in another one. What would be ideal and fastest for such a system, eg tuples of rgb values, color name strings, etcli liThe ability to draw and fill the inside of a polygon based on an array of its pixel coordinates. Drawing the outline of it I think should be pretty easy by just using the coordinates as indexes to the grid array and setting them to the outline color values. More difficult would be to fill the polygon. One way would be to iterate through all pixel cell coordinates or better yet only for the neighboring cells of each polygon coordinate point and test if its coordinates are within the polygon pixel coordinates. I know there are some simple insideoutsidebiggerthansmallerthan algorithms to test for point in poly using regular Python, but for my purpose this would be too slow and I am wondering if someone has the numpy skills to set up such an advanced linked code using only the speed of the numpy builtin functions to return True if a numpy pixel coordinate is inside a polygon.li liLastly, if someone would know how to draw a line between two pixelgridarray coordinates by filling in all the cells in between two pixels with a True or color valueli ol  pI know this is a tall order, but I was just curious to see if anyone would know. If so, then this could make for a pretty powerful and fast Numpybased drawing library. In the end I would like to save the grid array as an image which is easy by passing it to PIL. p  pI am aware that PIL and Aggdraw can do the polygon drawings and that this has been suggested in many similar posts, but they are not very effective when receiving a numpy array of xy polygonline coordinates. The assumption here is that my polygon coordinates are already in a numpy array format and I want to avoid the overhead of having to copy them into lists for every drawing when were talking about thousands of polygons frequently. So the difference in this post is about emhow to fill a polygon using pure Numpy.emp

However, when I click on Login, Register, or Manage, it is really slow 20 seconds. I suspect this might be related to the Membership provider. However, there is no membership provider in the template and it works without it, which might be because it uses Universal Membership. p  pThe Database is fine I checked it. It has been created, but it is still slow. When I first click on Hello, Serge it goes to the Manage.aspx page it takes 20 sec.

Negative 76120 pThere appears to be a difference between the default sorting of a TPair when compiling under 32 bit vs 64 bit. Under 32 bit, the default sort behaves like it is sorting on the Key of the pair, under 64 bit, it looks to sort by the Value. Is this to be expected, or am I missing something  p  pTested using Delphi XE2, update 4. In a VCL application, drop a button, checkbox and listbox onto the screen, declare the following type p  precodetype TPairComparer  TComparerltTPairltinteger,integergtgt codepre  pthen place the code below in the button OnClick and run. Under 32 bit, using the default sort, the pairs are listed by key i.e. 1,2,3,4,5,6. Under 64 bit, the pairs are listed by value i.e. 2,5,6,7,8,9 and NOT by key. p  pTo make the code work consistently across both platforms I have needed to specify my own comparer to force the sort by key on a 64 bit executable.p  precode procedure TForm1.Button1ClickSender TObject  var PriorityList            TListltTPairltInteger,integergtgt      Pair                    TPairltinteger,integergt      PairComparer            IComparerltTPairltinteger,integergtgt      iLoop                   integer  begin   PriorityList  TListltTPairltInteger,integergtgt.Create   PairComparer  TPairComparer.Construct  functionconst Left, Right TPairltinteger,integergt Integer  begin       case Left.Key  Right.Key of            true  Result  0       else        case Left.Key lt Right.Key of                        true  Result  1                   else        Result  1                   end       end  end   Pair.Key    6  Pair.Value  6  PriorityList.AddPair   Pair.Key    5  Pair.Value  5  PriorityList.AddPair   Pair.Key    4  Pair.Value  8  PriorityList.AddPair   Pair.Key    3  Pair.Value  9  PriorityList.AddPair   Pair.Key    2  Pair.Value  7  PriorityList.AddPair   Pair.Key    1  Pair.Value  2  PriorityList.AddPair   case Checkbox1.Checked of       true   PriorityList.Sort       false  PriorityList.SortPairComparer  end   ListBox1.Clear  for iLoop   0 to PriorityList.Count1 do      ListBox1.Items.AddFormatKey  d , Value  d,[PriorityList[iLoop].Key,PriorityList[iLoop].Value] codepre  pendp

Negative 76120 pI get an excel file from an ECHO machine where all measurements taken on the specific patient are collected these are always numbers, such as dimaters, areas, volumes or velocities.

You are in detached HEAD state.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may do so now or later by using b with the checkout command again. Example    git checkout b newbranchname  HEAD is now at d5b4c5e...

Negative 76120 pIm playing with the camelSQL component in order to run a quartzscheduled SQL report. My SQL is a lengthy query and I prefer to format it such that it spans many lines 92 lines to be exact even though it emcouldem be formatted into a single reaaaallly long line of text. p  pMy preference is to place this script into an external file and then run it. Alternatively, I could put it into a properties file not really my preference, but I tried that and even after adding a backslash  at the end of each line, it still causes an exception for some reason. Ignoring that issue for the time being, how might I run this script using camel SQL with the script residing in an external file Seems like it ought to be easy, but Im not sure how to do it.

Negative 76120 pIm completely perplexed by the behavior of a select box that I am experiencing. I have 2 consecutive codeselectcodes on my page in the django admin, for form codeidformcode and then section codeidsectioncode. If nothing is selected for the form, the section codeselectcode is disabled. When a form is selected, I use ajax to retrieve the sections of that form to display in the second codeselectcode.p  pMy AjaxjQuery retrieves and displays the correct sections, but I cannot change the selection.p  precodeidform.changefunction       var section  idsection     section.propdisabled, .trimthis.value        var evalformid  this.val     if evalformid.length gt 0          .getJSONsectionfilter  evalformid  , function data              idsection optionnot[value].remove             .eachdata, function index, value                  section.appendltoption gt.valvalue[0].textvalue[1]                                section.val1 .change codepre  pIf I  comment out the Ajax portion or when the empty option is selected for the form, the option 1 is selected, but when the ajax call occurs, it isnt. When I use the debugger in Chrome, the value in the select changes correctly at codesection.val1code, but for some reason it reverts to the empty choice at the very end of the jQuery.p  pThis is what I dont understand the jQuery changes the value whether the ajax call occurred or not, but it reverts the value before finishing.

Negative 76120 pFrom an abstract given in strongemHerbert Schildtemstrong book on strongemJavaemstrong.p  pTo write to a file, you can use the strongemwrite emstrong method defined by strongemFileOutputStreamemstrong.  Its simplest form is shown herep  precodevoid writeint byteval throws IOException codepre  pThis method strongemwritesemstrong the strongembyteemstrong specified by strongembytevalemstrong to the file. Although strongembytevalemstrong is declared as an integer, only the strongemloworder eight bitsemstrong are written to the file. p  pDoes that means only 28  256 combinations can be written. What if we have to include the strongemExtended ASCIIemstrong or strongemUnicodeemstrong ones.p  pSecondly,p  pJava defines two types of strongemstreamsemstrong strongembyteemstrong and strongemcharacteremstrong. Byte streams provide a convenient means for handling input and output of bytes. Byte streams are used, for example, when reading or writing binary data. Character streams provide a convenient means for handling input and output of characters. They use Unicode and, therefore, can be internationalized. Also, in some cases, character streams are more efficient than byte streams. p  precodeAt the lowest level, all IO is still byteoriented. The characterbased streams simply provide a   convenient and efficient means for handling characters. codepre  pConsole output is most easily accomplished with emprint em and strongemprintln emstrong. These methods are defined by the class strongemPrintStreamemstrong which is the type of strongemobjectemstrong referenced by strongemSystem.outemstrong. Even though strongemSystem.outemstrong is a strongbyte streamstrong, using it for simple program output is still acceptable. Because strongemPrintStreamemstrong is an output stream derived from strongemOutputStreamemstrong, it also implements the lowlevel method emwriteem . Thus, strongemwriteemstrong  can be used to write to the strongemconsoleemstrong. The simplest form of write  defined by strongemPrintStreamemstrong is shown herep  precodevoid writeint byteval codepre  pThis method writes to the stream the byte specified by byteval. Although byteval is declared as an integer, only the loworder eight bits are written. Here is a short example that uses write  to output the character A followed by a newline to the screenp  precodeclass WriteDemo      public static void mainString args[]       int b     b  A     System.out.writeb     System.out.writen     System.out.write65     System.out.writen     System.out.writeA     System.out.writen      codepre  pOutputp  precodeA A A codepre  pEven though strongemSystem.outemstrong is a strongbyte streamstrong, then why does it output in the form of Characters and not in the form of bytes. Or Am i taking it wrong. Byte Streams have nothing to do with the representation of the output.p

Negative 76120 pSome months ago I installed the CyangenMod 11 currently M10 on a Samsung Galaxy S2 and since M9 I found an annoying issue that has not been fixed so far when I plug in the headset, all notification sounds and ringtone of incoming calls are heard through the headset instead of the speakerphone. So Im trying to write  an app to redirect the incoming call ringtone to the speaker phone. I found some code on the net and I was able to write a small app that waits for an incoming call and, when a call is received, launches setSpeakerphoneOntrue and writes the caller number on a log file. The file is populated with caller numbers then the app is working but the speakerphone remains mute and the ringtone is heard through the headset. It seems that the call receiver app of the Cyanogenmod ROM overrides my settings. The manifest file has android.permission.MODIFYAUDIOSETTINGS set.p  pAny suggestion Thank you, regards.p  pBobp

Also because this is a class project I can only use what I have been taught so the only Layouts we have learned are BorderLayout, FlowLayout, and GridLayout. Any help would be appreciated. p
Negative 76120 pI have a script using threaded timers that manipulates 2 common lists at random.p  pBecause the class instances manipulate the lists on threaded timers, I cannot pass the variables to the classes amp back.  p  pAll instances of the classes need to manipulate a single, up to date list.p  pBecause of that, the scope of those lists are set to global.  However, I need the scope to be at the class level, yet be manipulated by multiple classes.p  pTo clarify...p  pHeres the basic program structurep  precodeGlobal list variable1 Global list variable2  class MasterClass      this creates instances of the threaded classes.

Negative 76120 pI have been trying to create a simple scrolling ground node in my SK game for quite a few days now. The problem is, no matter what I try, I have little gaps in between each piece of the ground. Basically what I have right now is a method that is called, which takes the node and animates it by moving it across the screen with a certain duration a variable called codegameSpeedcode and then on codecompletioncode it runs a block that calls itself again. Every time though, I get these little tiny gaps, maybe 4 to 5 pixels wide, that seem to be the result of the method being called .02 seconds after it is completed.p  pI am not sure what to do. I have legitimately tried at least a few dozen workarounds. Before, I had worked around the problem by having a ground node that looked messy, and so I would have multiple methods calling the ground drawing method on staggered intervals, and there would never be any gaps. The overlaps werent noticible because of the randomness of the ground. Unfortunately now that I have designed a ground node that I like the looks of, which has a discernible pattern, the brute force method of just shoving a bunch of nodes on top of each other to cover up the gaps will no longer work.p  pstrongOn top of that, during the course of one ground node traveling the distance of the screen, the gamespeed changes about 23 times. I need the ground to be responsive to these changes with its movement.strong Could anyone direct me towards a good solutionp

Negative 76120 pSo Im interacting with a 3rd party library, which raises exceptions someti0mes, but it raises the same exception for basically emeverythingem specifically codesuds.WebFaultcode. Its possible however to determine the exact type of exception it is from the data on the exception raised. Im looking to abstract this exception into exceptions that subclass this type, iep  precodefrom suds import WebFault  class MoreSpecificErrorWebFault     pass codepre  pI like the subclassing, because it wont break existing implementations that expect a codeWebFaultcode. The problem Im having is passing the data already on the codeWebFaultcode into the codeMoreSpecificErrorcode. What I would like to do is take the existing exception object and just turn it into the subclass, without any changes or rerunning codeinitcode. What Ive done so far to accomplish this is something likep  precodefrom suds import WebFault  class MoreSpecificErrorWebFault      You pass the old WebFault when instantiating this exception.      Then it gets poofed into a MoreSpecificError type     def newcls, internalfault         return internalfault      This is necessary to prevent the parent class init from being run     def initself, internalfault         pass codepre  h1Edit I now know this doesnt work, the new object will not be of the subclass typeh1  pWhich works, but the need to put that codeinitcode thats just a codepasscode feels really gross to me. Not to mention some stuff doesnt like custom codenewcode methods read codedeepcopycode, its not a choice, the testing framework we use lettuce uses it and were pretty far invested already.p  pIm wondering if theres a better way to do this I know the ideal way is just to raise the subclass initially, but Id really rather not start working with a forked copy of this library. Im really hoping theres some magic somewhere in Python I just dont know yet.p

Essentially I have a couple bundles of JS files aliased below as codehandlebarsTemplatescode and codeglobalJscode that have been prebundled with concat and I want to then bundle them in with some libraries.  Ive attempted to do this in my package.jsonp  precodebrowser      jqueryCookie .bowercomponentsjquerycookiejquery.cookie.js,     fitvids .bowercomponentsfitvidsjquery.fitvids.js,     history .bowercomponentshistory.jsscriptsbundleduncompressedhtml4html5jquery.history.js,     handlebars .websitegutsassetsjslibrarieshandlebarsv1.3.0.js,     oform .bowercomponentsoformdistoForm.min.js,     moment .bowercomponentsmomentjsmoment.js,     handlebarsTemplates .tempassetsjshandlebarsTemplates.js,     globalJs .tempassetsjsglobal.js   ,   browserifyshim      jquery globaljQuery,     modernizr globalModernizr,     jqueryCookie  exports null ,     history History,     moment moment,     oform Oform,     fastlick globalFastClick,     handlebars Handlebars,     fitvids  exports null ,     handlebarsTemplates        exports null,       depends [         handlebarsHandlebars       ]     ,     globalJs        exports null,       depends [         moment,         historyHistory,         oformOform       ]        , codepre  pthen in my browserify grunt taskp  precodebundle      options        transform [         [browserifyshim, global true]       ],       external globals,       require sharedWithoutGlobals     ,     src .gruntbrowserifyconfigbundleInit.js,     dest lt config.dist gtassetsjsbundle.js    codepre  pI have also tried below similar to the solution referenced in the link above p  precodebundle      options        external globals,       require sharedWithoutGlobals,       preBundleCB function b          b.transformglobal true, browserifyshim            ,     src .gruntbrowserifyconfigbundleInit.js,     dest lt config.dist gtassetsjsbundle.js    codepre  pBoth targets yield the same results that when I reference another alias as a dependency in the same task browserify shim will coderequirecode the path to the dependency code......websitegutsassetsjslibrarieshandlebarsv1.3.0.jscode rather than the dependence alias.  If I go through my bundle and manually replace these paths with the alias name, in this case codehandlebarscode, then my code works perfectly.  p  pI know this is probably a strange use case for Browserify but this is project with a lot of previously defined Global dependencies, and a specific build that is only possible in Grunt not Gulp, so Im trying to find a solution to integrate browserify without having to completely overhaul the build.p

In this case, this opens the dialog box of excels function wizard  a windows with n cells, each corresponding to one argument of F assuming that  F is a function taking n argumebts. strongNow, by default, has you enter something in one of the cells, excel trigger recalculation of the function.strongp  pThis is particularly handy when you dont know the function and want to discover it, because you can see if what you type represents a correct argument for F etc, for instance errors do appears etc.p  pBut strongif F relies on a very intensive numerical routine in c, then all the recalculations take a way too long time, and are freezing the wizard. Because each time a cell in dialog box is modified, a recalculation is triggerde.strongp  pTherefore I would like to do the following  strongdeactivate somehow the recalculation when the function is called through the function wizard. This is lets say the low quality solution.strongp  pstrongIdeally, I would like to do the following  autorize the recalculations to be triggered, but ensure in the c excel sdk code that they are done in a different thread that the one in which the wizard is called.

Negative 76120 pI am trying to scale an image on a mobile web page packaged via cordova for AndroidiOS so it always has a known width in centimeters. Regardless of the screen resolution  size  I need the image to have a known width in centimeters. If I would be doing this the native way I would check the screen ppi points per inch and then adjust image width in pixels accordingly. p  pI tried various solutions from stackoverflow but failed to find a solution. p  pIs developing a cordova plugin that would cover that on each platform separately is the only solution or this can be done via some javascript or cordova code.p
Negative 76120 pI am trying to populate a Kendo mvcGrid and I keep getting the error An item with the same key has already been added.p  pI have seen elsewhere that duplicate model properties is the likeliest source of the problem but I have no duplicate properties in my model. Ive even simplified everything to just a basic mock up to eliminate as many possible variables as possible..and I cant get the grid to load data.p  pIve tried it as a Html.Partial where its not loaded initially because of a empty model and then loading it through jquery...Ive tried with passing in am empty model so that the grid will load initially without data and then doing a datasource refresh...no luck there either.  Basically as soon as I try to add content to the grid with a populated model I get the error and no data is loaded.p  pBeen fighting this issue for 2 days now and had no luck.  Ill post my code here maybe someone else can see what Im missing.p  pOne variable that cant change is the grid resides on a partial view with a model different from its parent view.p  pin the parent view I have tried bothp  precodeltdiv id columnkgridgtHtml.RenderPartialColumns, new TestFieldIssue.Models.FieldListModelltdivgt codepre  pand p  precodeltdiv idcolumnkgridgtHtml.PartialColumns, new TestFieldIssue.Models.FieldListModelltdivgt codepre  peither way will succeed in posting a grid with no data..it has no data yet because its populated by the selection of a value in a dropdown list.p  pso as to not over complicate the sample Ive just set a hard coded value in the jquery function I have been using to refresh the grid.p  precodefunction loadgrid      var grid  grid.datakendoGrid     var val  1     grid.dataSource.read tablepk val      grid.refresh      codepre  pthe grid code in the partial once again kept it simple without any bells and whistles just to test.p  precode Html.Kendo.GridModel.fields                         .DataSourcedata gt data                             .Ajax                             .Modelmodel gt model.Idm gt m.fieldpk                             .Readr gt r.ActionColumns,Home                                                       .Namegrid                         .Columnsc gt                                                                                            c.Boundm gt m.fieldname.TitleField Name.Width100                                   codepre  pand the controller methods loading some mock data p  precodepublic ActionResult Columnsint tablepk                      FieldListModel model             if tablepk  null                              model  GetEmptyColumns                          else                              model  GetColumns                          return PartialViewColumns, model                  public FieldListModel GetColumns                      FieldListModel model  new FieldListModel             model.fields  new ListltFieldModelgt             model.fields.Addnew FieldModel  fieldname  field1, fieldpk  1              model.fields.Addnew FieldModel  fieldname  field2, fieldpk  2              model.fields.Addnew FieldModel  fieldname  field3, fieldpk  3              return model                  public FieldListModel GetEmptyColumns                      FieldListModel model  new FieldListModel             model.fields  new ListltFieldModelgt             model.fields.Addnew FieldModel  fieldname  , fieldpk  0              return model          codepre  pand a very simple Modelp  precodepublic class FieldListModel              public ListltFieldModelgt fields  get set        public class FieldModel              public int fieldpk  get set          public string fieldname  get set       codepre

Negative 76120 pI have no trouble performing CSS3 transitions and animations, but Im finding trouble combining them without some glitches.p  pI have a list of links. When the user hovers over one, it should glow using textshadow, but sort of slowly pulse in and out. But hovering and leaving the link should give a slight transition in and out of the glow. I cant seem to get the animation to end smoothly. Since the animation starts with a glow in, thats fine, but the moment the user leaves the link, it reverts to its ON state, and then transitions to OFF. This looks fine if the animation happens to be full on at the time of leaving, but if the glow is low, it will first blink full on and then go out.p  pIm aware of the need to use different vendor prefixes, for the example Ill just use the webkit versionsp  precodeli    textshadow 0 0 2px rgba255,255,255,0   webkittransition 0.5s   lihover    textshadow 0 0 2px rgba255,255,255,1   webkitanimation blink 0.5s easeinout infinite alternate   webkitkeyframes blink       0  textshadow 0 0 2px rgba255,255,255,0      100  textshadow 0 0 2px rgba255,255,255,1   codepre  pFYI, notice that Im using just 0 and 100, but with the alternate direction parameter set, which produces a reverseloop same as if I set a 0 50 and 100.

Negative 76120 pI have implemented a restful API where i receive a website and return path to screenshots I am using PhantomJS v 2.0.0 development to make the screenshots. I am making a console command that is executed with a secured, systemlike function. I use SU to log as a user phantomjs, which is restricted to use only specified commands, and then call my phantomjs script to render webpages as jpegs. The files outputted are owned by phantomjs and have permissions set to 644. We have added the user phantomjs to group wwwdata.p  pWe are putting lots of webshots in a directory, and separate them alphabetically in subdirectories.So far so good. Our work scenario requires that we occasionally delete webshots. So i implemented a restful deleteapi which clients can use to delete their webshots. The real problem emerges from the fact that the files are owned by phantomjs and with permissions set to 644, we cant delete the files through wwwdata. Since phantomjs is in the same group with wwwdata, we need the permissions to be set to 664 in order to be able to unlink those. p  pWe wouldnt like to allow the user phantomjs to use chmod or rm, because this would go against our design idea to restrict the user maximally, since this user runs shell commands. We dont like the solution to run a cronjob that changes file permissions, because the server is pretty busy, and this solution is very undesirable and should be our last resort We tried using ACL making every file in webshots dir to have default permissions of 664, but this didnt work with our NFS as expected. Upgrading the NFS is not an option for me right now. We tried umask 002, but this worked only with files created through the shell, so it couldnt help us either. p  pIve noticed that if i save an empty file through sublimetext , file permissions are 664. If i save a screenshot with phantomjs, f.p. are 644.  My questions are What governs default file permissions, the running process itself or some user preferences from which you run the application Can you give me any more ideas how to delete webshots securely or make phantomjs owned files have perms 664 without giving the user too much dangerous permissions.p  pAny help would be highly appreciated. Thank you.p

This is the first time Im using Jenkins and I was able to set it all up, it fetches the code from the gitlab repository, but right now there is no build action configured. For fun i tried to simply make it use a windows batchfile as build file and added codeecho testcode. Checking the console output it downloads the repository code and then tries to execute the batchfile, result isp  pcodejava.io.IOException Cannot run program cmd in directory varlibjenkinsworkspaceProject java.io.IOException error2, No such file or directorycodep  pThis of course makes sense, but I wonder now, is there a way to build a C project with jenkins on a debian server without resorting to mono or something I know that people build C projects for windows with Jenkins on a linux root, so there has to be some sort of cross compiling possibilities.p  pIf the Visual Studio 2015 is a dealbreaker I can also strap it down to VS13 or even below. Any help is greatly appreciatedp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIts probably important to say that Mono is strongNOTstrong an option. Im using features like WPF that are not available for Mono.p

Negative 76120 pI am new to the world of Django and Zeropush. I am trying to build a rest api for a mobile application, along with pushnotifications. After some research I decided to go with zeropush to push notifications to the phone. However as a new Django developer I could not understand the documentation to integrate zeropush into django. They provide sample code to pushnotifications to the user a hrefhttpsgithub.comhakanwdjangozeropushblobmasterREADME.md relnofollowhttpsgithub.comhakanwdjangozeropushblobmasterREADME.mda, however, I am confused as to where that code is supposed to go and how am I supposed to call the method that pushes the notifications to the phone its supposed to detect a new entry in the database,and call the function automatically . They also want us to add zeropush.url to the url.py file, I am not sure how to do this either. Please help, Ive never worked with pushnotifications before. Thanks a lot.p

Negative 76120 pIm having trouble figuring out how to launch a VM on a Windows 7 host machine with XP mode installed, but have it start minimized. Starting in the background in a noninteractive session with psexec or powershell is also ok. The main problem is that when trying to launch vmwindow.exe remotely, vpc.exe doesnt start. If I try to launch vpc.exe remotely, vmwindow.exe will not start, and both are needed to run. p  pI can launch the VM via command line on the host machine using the following command, which works, but will launch it in windowed mode. Ive tried variations on minimized, but cant get it to work.p  precodegt vmwindow file Cpathcomputer.vmcx codepre  pIf I launch the same command via powershell remotely, vmwindow will start in the process list, but vpc will not. p  precodeGetContent list.txt  ForEachObject  InvokeCommand ComputerName  ScriptBlock  amp cmd.exe C vmwindow file Cpathcomputer.vmcx   codepre  pOther things I have tried  Creating a shortcut to the VM and specifying Minimized in the Run box still launches in windowed mode or full screen.  Putting the command into a batch file and calling it through powershell on the remote PC vpc.exe will not start. Creating a VMwindow service to start in the background with the PC vpc.exe will not startp  pSo it seems I can start one or the other, not both remotely. But if I enter the command directly on the host PC, both will start normally. The idea here is to have the VM running if the PC is restarted or can be started with a remote monitoring script, but not have it visible to the local user. Any help is greatly appreciated. p

Negative 76120 pIm studying mutexes and deadlocks in c pthreads from a hrefhttpwww.yolinux.comTUTORIALSLinuxTutorialPosixThreads.html relnofollowhttpwww.yolinux.comTUTORIALSLinuxTutorialPosixThreads.htmlap  pI understood them but i stacked at a point. I didnt understand what is the problem of the below code. Can you explain it with simple and clear words please I quoted from this sitep  pMutex Deadlock ... Be careful when applying two or more mutexes to a section of code. If the first pthreadmutexlock is applied and the second pthreadmutexlock fails due to another thread applying a mutex, the first mutex may eventually lock all other threads from accessing data including the thread which holds the second mutex. The threads may wait indefinitely for the resource to become free causing a deadlock. It is best to test and if failure occurs, free the resources and stall before retrying.p  precode01  ... 02  pthreadmutexlockampmutex1 03  while  pthreadmutextrylockampmutex2    Test if already locked    04   05     pthreadmutexunlockampmutex1   Free resource to avoid deadlock  06         ... 07      stall here    08     ... 09     pthreadmutexlockampmutex1 10   11  count 12  pthreadmutexunlockampmutex1 13  pthreadmutexunlockampmutex2 14  ... codepre  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 76120 pI am interested in simple game programming with AndEngine. And I would like to do some basic round based strategy stuff. So I would like to have a top down view to some grid. Every square in this chess like grid should be clickable touchable on android of course. But I cant imagine drawing lines and squares is the best solution to do so. I would like to have some kind of abstract object list, which I can extend to different behaviours one click triggers menu to open, on other field a click triggers an explosion, whatever.... p  pI have been searching for this in several engines over the years now. It is a hobby, but I would like to find a solution for it. Can anyone give me a hint about how this could be done in an elegant way Double buffering, rendering and stuff isnt that important. The important thing is, every square should be an object that gets painted.p  pAnyone  Regards.p
Negative 76120 pI wrote this for an OS class assignment that Ive already completed and handed in. I posted this question yesterday, but due to Academic Honesty regulations I took it off until after the submission deadline. p  pThe object was to learn how to use critical sections. There is a codedatacode array with 100 monotonously increasing numbers, 0...99, and 40 threads that randomly swap two elements 2,000,000 times each. Once a second a codeCheckercodegoes through and makes sure that there is only one of each number which means that no parallel access happened. p  pHere were the Linux times p  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodereal    0m5.102s user    0m5.087s sys     0m0.000s codepre  pand the OS X times p  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodereal    6m54.139s user    0m41.873s sys     6m43.792s codepre  p I run a vagrant box with codeubuntutrusty64code on the same machine that is running OS X. It is a quadcore i7 2.3Ghz up to 3.2Ghz 2012 rMBP. p  pIf I understand correctly, codesyscode is system overhead, which I have no control over, and even then, 41s of user time suggests that perhaps the threads are running serially. p  pI can post all the code if needed, but I will post the bits I think are relevant. I am using codepthreadscode since thats what Linux provides, but I assumed they work on OS X. p  pCreating codeswappercode threads to run codeswapManyTimescode routinep  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodefor int i  0 i lt NUMTHREADS i      int err  pthreadcreateampthreads[i], NULL, swapManyTimes, NULL  codepre  pcodeSwappercode thread critical section, run in a for loop 2 million timesp  pre classlangc prettyprintoverridecodepthreadmutexlockampmutex     begin critical section int tmpFirst  data[first] data[first]  data[second] data[second]  tmpFirst pthreadmutexunlockampmutex   end critical section codepre  pOnly one codeCheckercode thread is created, same way as codeSwappercode.

Negative 76120 pI built a class that watches for changes in a directory and upload them to a server, it is working fine for strongonestrong dir.

I dont mind that it opens in Safari, since at this point it prompts you to open up these directions in the Google Maps app. But heres where it gets muddy.p  pWhen you click the use the app button from Safari, the custom route does not carry over to the app. You are shown default route choices based on Point A and B.p  pThe a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.commapsdocumentationdirectionsWaypoints relnofollowGoogle Directions APIa section on Waypoints and using the via prefix seems like the best way around this, but Im not sure how Id turn that into something clickable from an email.p  pFor reference, a hrefhttpsgoo.glmapsBNtz4 relnofollowhere is one of the mapsa I made with a custom route. Basically I want to have it go from Point A to B along one road. I had to make a handful of points along the route in order to keep the route on the same stretch of road. p  pFurther complicating this is Googles attempt to reroute even this map, based on realtime traffic.

Negative 76120 pIm frustrated, trying to add methods to a custom iterator.p  pFor an assignment in my second quarter Java class, we are supposed to implement, from scratch, a linked list. No problem I have created an outer class to implement the linked list and a static private inner class to implement the individual nodes, to encapsulate them, hidden from any client program.p  pThe nodes in this linked list are to have two distinct next fields one for names and another for places. Following one of the next fields will take me through all the nodes by one path following the other next field will take me another route. Think two distinct alphabetical orders, depending on name or on place. No problem to iterate through the nodes, following the names or following the places, I created two custom iterators. One abstract class implements codeIteratorlt Node gtcode and common code, and two inner classes implement the custom code for each iterator through either the nextName field or the nextPlace field.p  pThe codenextcode and codehasNextcode methods work beautifully, giving customized results depending on whether Ive instantiated a name or a place iterator.p  pThese nodes also contain data I want to print to the console and save in a file. The nodes were deliberately encapsulated inside the list class to protect them from rogue use by a client program. I thought to extend my iterators by adding accessor methods, such as codegetNamecode and codegetPlacecode methods.

Negative 76120 pI am building a website which uses two jQuery plugins simultaneously. Please forgive me in advance if there is an easy answer to this, I am pretty good with HTMLCSS but less experienced with JS. Essentially, this specific part of the site has a relatively positioned div container, with two divs on top the bottom one absolutely positioned and the top one relatively positioned. It looks like thisp  precodeltdiv styleposition relative height 500pxgt  ltdiv styleposition absolute zindex 1 width 100gt lt This is where an Image SliderCarousel should be gt ltdivgt  ltdiv styleposition relative zindex 2gt lt This is where I have my nav, which is a horizontal accordion gt ltdivgt  ltdivgt codepre  pIve tried a few different sliderscarousels such as UnSlider and SKDSlider, and the accordion nav is based off of Demo 2 on this page a hrefhttpwww.dynamicdrive.comdynamicindex17haccordion.htm relnofollowhttpwww.dynamicdrive.comdynamicindex17haccordion.htmap  pThe problem is, I can make each of these work separately, but they wont work together.  When the slideshow is working, the horizontal accordion wont expand, and when the accordion is working, the slideshow doesnt even appear.p  pI feel like the problem Im having is similar to what was brought up in this question, however the jQuery.noConflict  doesnt seem to be working for me. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24138530multiplejquerypluginsarenotworkingsimultaneouslyandaffectingeachothersMultiple Jquery plugins are not working simultaneously and affecting each others functionalitiesap  pAny help is appreciated, and I can supply more code if necessary. All I really want is to have the accordion expand with a slideshow playing in the background. Again, my apologies if this is an easy fix, Im still learning jQuery and may have just missed something. To give everyone a general idea, the result that Im going for is something like this a hrefhttpcamelliasinensis.comen relnofollowhttpcamelliasinensis.comena. Not exactly visually, but the idea that a horizontal accordion nav is on top of an image slideshow.p  pThanks again,p  pChristopherp

Negative 76120 pIm looking for any information on how to create a comment system, like Facebook or whatever, and I am having trouble finding one. The word comment is too ubiquitous to return any useful info and I have never seen anything that covered this topic so I have no starting point. Any help would be appreciated as I feel like I am going about this in an overly complicated way. I plan to download the comments from Parse, then I assumed I would put them into an Array in my app. Then update something like commentLabel.text to whatever is in the Array. If so how would you go about doing this Would it be something likep  precodelet comment  [String] codepre  pThen fill the array with comments from Parse and then something likep  precodefor comments in comment      var label  UILabelframe CGRectMake0, 0, 200, 20   label.text  comments   self.view.addSubviewlabel   codepre  pI know that code is incomplete. Im basically just asking if thats the way to do it and it seems like it would be, but then how do you go about making sure the labels are created at the correct position, just below the previous comment for example, and how do you ensure the CGRect adjusts to the text provided Im really struggling with this concept. If this is the correct way to do this, Ill muddle through it but I want to make sure that theres not some much simpler way that I have just not been able to find. Thanks.p

Negative 76120 h1Problemh1  pAfter I fill an codeNSMutableArraycode with objects and try to do something with it, it contains codeid0x0code on some indices. I thought adding nil to an codeNSMutableArraycode wasnt possible at all in ObjectiveC so I am wondering why this happens. p  h2When does this happenh2  pSometimes unfortunately. It is reproducible by downloading more than 5000 tiles, just to get the amount high enough for a chance for this to occur. Even with more than 5000 tiles it sometimes goes flawlessly. p  h2Contexth2  pMy app has a button which starts a download for map tiles for a specific region. The download happens parallel in background threads and reports back for every tile downloaded. p  pTo allow for canceling the download, in my downloader singleton I have a temporary codeNSMutableArraycode which saves a hash from every tile downloaded. After canceling, I can use that list of hashes to delete every saved tile in the database. p  pSaving the hashes during downloading seems to go fine, but when I actually want to do anything with it I use code[currentTileHashes copy]code to change it to an codeNSArraycode to give to the delete method, it throws an codeNSInvalidArgumentExceptioncodeon that line saying p  precode[NSPlaceholderArray initWithObjectscount] attempt to insert nil object from objects[3402] codepre  pWhen I use the debugger to inspect the codecurrentTileHashescode mutable array, I indeed see that one or two of the indices is actually nil or codeid0x0code.

Negative 76120 pIm using CodedUI in WPF, Visual Studio 2013, using a combination of the built in tools, and hand written tests.p  pIm trying to click a basic button on a popup window. I have similar windows that work fine, from external libraries, however this is from my own.p  precodeMouse.ClickUIMap.StubWindow.OK codepre  pThis creates an error, as it cannot find the OK button. Additionally callingp  precodeUIMap.StubWindow.DrawHighlight codepre  pFails also, not being able to find the window. However sometimes it draws an outline around the Start Button in Windows. Strangely, both of the below lines work correctly, after calling FindMatchingControls.p  precodeUIMap.StubWindow.FindMatchingControls UIMap.StubWindow.DrawHighlight Mouse.ClickUIMap.StubWindow.OK codepre  pThe problem is, it takes around 510s for FindMatchingControls to execute, as it has to search all top level windows on the system.

Negative 76120 pI would like to have a Show page for a specific Post, and I would like to use the same view for an Index page showing all Posts.p  pThe Index page renders Posts using codengrepeatpost as vm.postscode, so I show each Posts title with codepost.titlecode.p  pThe Show page renders a Post by using the controller to fetch the data based on the Postss ID passed in the URL, so I show the Posts title with codevm.post.titlecode.p  pI need to have both pages use the same syntax in order for the view to render. I can accomplish this easily using codescope.post  Post.getid idcode in the Show controller.

Negative 76120 pI have a best practice question related to adding listings to favourites on a classifieds website.p  pThe website will display 20 listings per page in the search results, and each listing will have a small add to favourites icon which when clicked will use Ajax to add the listing Id and user id to the favourites table.  The icon will then have its CSs class changed to show its a favourite.  If you click it again it will be removed from the favourites table.p  pEvery time I display a listing search page, I planned on running a MySQL query using to create an array of all favourite listing ids for the current user. then When looping round the listings to display, use inarray to check wether the current listing is A favourite, and display the correct icon.p  pThe only problem with this is that I would need to lookup all favourites on every page load.  Is this the best way, or would you advise keeping and updating the favourite list in sessionsp
