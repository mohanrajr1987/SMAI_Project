Positive 265 pIf I have an application App referencing a library Lib1 which itself reference another library Lib2, when App references Lib1, it will also copy the Lib2 dll and work fine.p  pIf I also add another reference to App to another different library, but with the same name as Lib2 Lib2bis, Lib1 will try to use the types from Lib2bis instead of Lib2 as the Lib2 file, I believe, gets overwritten by the Lib2bis file named the same.p  pSince the reference from App to Lib2 is indirect, I wont know that Lib2bis conflicts with Lib2 until the execution which will cause a runtime error.p  pIs there any way to preventresolve this issue apart from renaming the libraries... ideally, not using alias, but I would be interested in knowing the alias solution as well if one.p

Positive 265 pI have a question regarding FXCop analysis using SonarQube with the MSBuildRunner. I have realized that the MSBuildRunner loads a rules file from the server which matches the quality profile in Sonar and uses that file for the FXCop run.p  pIn our project we have a solution with several projects. For each project a rules file is configured depending on its type e.g. product or test code. We also use custom rules in own FXCop assemblies. p  pHow can I configure MSBuildRunner so that he uses the rules file which is configured in the project file How can I add our custom rules into Sonar Can I import our rules files somehowp  pThanks for your helpp

Positive 265 pI am having problems with a build server that I am trying to set up. We use telerik, and have installed the libraries with the telerik control panel. The build process searches for the dlls all the wrong places.p  pNeedless to say that the solutions builds perfectly on developer maschines.p  pThe solution contains many projects, and not a single main project. I really do not want to have to change all the projfiles. p  pWhat I want is to add the telerik directory to AssemblySearchPaths, but using the msbuild parameters from the gui only got me to overwrite the AssemblySearchPath  with the result that the location of everything else but telerik files became unknown to build.p  pSo I located a .targets file, which I read in the logfiles were utilized by build to set AssemblySearchPaths. And adding the telerik directory here did the trick alas I still cannot get the build server to find the nuget dlls but that is another story.p  pHowever, I see that depending on selected CPU and perhaps other circumstances, the build uses another similar named .targets file from another location. Also, I find it less than optimal that such crutial customization is hidden away in a automatically installed file somewhere obscure.p  pSo the question is how to add more searchpaths to the ones already defined by the frameworkp  pI am somewhat unfamiliar with ms build, but I did see an full fledged ms build file once which is why I knew it defines the build searh paths. However alternatives which does not require that I change the projects in the solution will work for me.p  pThanksp

Positive 265 pWe use TFSonline but have a local build server which defaulted to two build agents when we set it up. Our app is set for continuous builds on checkin.p  pWe found that when building packages the two agents had their own independent build number sequences, so that when agent1 ran it would save our package to NuGet as something like 1.2.3.37032 and then agent2 ran it would create a package 1.2.3.29321p  pHence our deployment server was picking an older build when updating the application.p  pI realise we should also increment the version number e.g. 1.2.4 each time as well, but for every single checkin thats rather laborious.p  pFor now we have had to disable one build agent to prevent this  is there a better way to do this, or a way to ensure the build numbers are sequentialp
Positive 265 pIm facing situation where team develops solution using VS 2015 on local machines and CI in this case TeamCity is configured to use VS 2013 to build solution and later create installation pack with compiled app. TeamCity version is 8.1 and VS 2015 is not supported. As an implication MSBuild uses two different toolset versions on CI on local machines. Im not sure if thats the right way to create software.p  pWhats your experiences Is there something you can suggest Or do you think its safe to do it that wayp
Positive 265 pIm using Visual Studio 2013. I have a Custom Build Tool I think thats the right terminology at least created which processes Simulink .slx files. The gist of how it works is that VS will compile a Simulink model by launching MATLABSimulink and telling it to build the Simulink model into a DLL and generate some headers for use in other VS projects in the Solution. That functionality works just fine from the MATLABSimulink side. p  pThis Custom Build Tool, called Real Time Workshop  SLX, consists of a .props file, a .targets file, and a .xml file. To use it, I have a VS project with its Configuration Type set to Utility Properties, General page and my Custom Build Tool checked in the projects Build DependenciesBuild Customization... dialog. Then I drag various .slx files onto the project in the Solution Explorer and it adds them. Then I can build the project and it will process each .slx file as described above. p  pEach .slx file is dependent on a number of MATLAB scripts and other files. Changes in one of those other files needs to trigger a rebuild of the .slx file by Simulink. Currently, whenever the .slx file itself is unchanged, VS just skips over it. I cant seem to set additional dependencies for the .slx files.p  pIf I go to the Properties dialog for an individual .slx file, the Item Type specifies my Real Time Workshop  SLX as expected. However, when I go to the General page underneath Real Time Workshop  SLX things are grayed out and there is no Additional Dependencies entry.p  pI thought the purpose of Custom Build Tools was specifically to enable special processing like this. How do I specify file dependencies for the individual .slx files to be processed by my Real Time Workshop  SLX Custom Build Toolp  pOne other thing to note is that it appears that additional dependencies can be added to the .props file within the codeltAdditionalDependenciesgtcode tag, but then that creates a dependency relationship for emallem .slx files, which is not a viable solution.p

While the users window is up, he receives 10 new messages. Since Im only showing him five, no big deal. The problem happens when the user starts to delete his notifications. If he deletes the five that are displayed, the five older ones will be displayed on the next ajax call or refresh.p  pId like to have my models save method delete everything but the 5 most recent objects whenever a new one is saved. Unfortunately, you cant use [5] to do this.

Negative 265 pIn todays world where a lot of computers, mobile devices or web services share data or act like hubs, syncing gets more important. As we all know solutions that sync arent the most comfortable ones and its best not to sync at all.p  pIm still curious how you would implement a syncing solution to sync between multiple entities. There are already a lot of different approaches, like comparing a changed date field or a hash and using the most recent data or letting the user chose what he wants to use in a case of a conflict. Another approach is to try to automatically merge conflicted data which in my opinion isnt so clever, because a machine cant guess what the user meant.p  pAnyway, here are a couple of questions related to sync that we should answer before starting to implement syncingp  ul liWhat is the most recent data How do I want to represent itli liWhat do I do in case of a conflict Merge Do I prompt and ask the user what to doli liWhat do I do when I get into an inconsistent state e.g. a disconnect due to a flakey mobile network connectionli liWhat do I have to do when I dont want to get into an inconsistent stateli liHow do I resume a current sync that got interruptedli liHow do I handle data storage e.g. MySQL database on a web service, Core Data on an iPhone and how do I mergesync the data without a lot of glue codeli liHow should I handle edits from the user that happen during the sync which runs in the background, so the UI isnt blockedli liHow and in which direction do I propagate changes e.g. a user creates a Foo entry on his computer and doesnt sync then hes on the go and creates another Foo entry what happens when he tries to sync both devices Will the user have two Foo entries with different unique IDs Will the user have only one entry, but which oneli liHow should I handle sync when I have hierarchical data Topdown Bottomup Do I treat every entry atomically or do I only look at a supernode How big is the tradeoff between oversimplifying things and investing too much time into the implementationli lili ul  pThere are a lot of other questions and I hope that I could inspire you enough. Syncing is a fairly general problem. Once a good, versatile syncing approach is found, it should be easier to apply it to a concrete application, rather than start thinking from scratch. I realize that there are already a lot of applications that try to solve or successfully solve syncing, but they are already fairly specific and dont give enough answers to syncing approaches in general.p

Negative 265 pSo i have a custom CMS running under .Net 3.5 written entirely in c. The engine is optimized to render for mobile devices, but also server to normal web browsers. It also supports cookieless sessions. Great...p  pIve chosen not to cache anything including browser data in order to control the rendering completely from data. This has been all good until lately.p  pThe engine implements a basic login function that simply logs the user state within a session object. p  pThe behavior is rather strange.

Negative 265 pMost views in my project accept an optional username parameter and if exists, filter the querysets passed to the templates for that user. So, for examplep  pthe index view handles both the following url patternsp  precode  general index page Pltusernamegt[w]  index page for the user  photos  photo index page Pltusernamegt[w]photos  photos for that user ... codepre  pAs there are a number of such applications, it doesnt seem very DRY to implement the same logic by replicating the patterns. I thought it may be possible to recursively include the main urls.py module, so I did thisp  precodeurlrPltusernamegt[w], includeurls, codepre  pMy reasoning was that, when an other urls module is included, the matched pattern is removed from the path. So, I was hoping that p  precodePltusernamegt[w]photos codepre  pwould become p  precodephotos codepre  pwhen it is matched by the recursively included urls module, with the extra username parameter. But this caused the development server to die silently when a request is made.p  pThe second approach I can think of is to write a middleware, which would match the pattern in the url, if exists, and add the viewed user to the request and remove the part that matches the username from the request path. But I dont want to mess with the path as this may have unpredictable results. p  pWhat would you recommend Am I too picky for DRYnessp  pThanks, oMatp

Negative 265 pI have the following question on SSLTLS.br After the server hello, starts the authentication phase of the server.br From various articlesbooks, it appears that this phase is optional. E.g. in wiki p  blockquote   pThe server sends its Certificate   message depending on the selected   cipher suite, this may be omitted by   the server.p blockquote  pBut I do not understand what it means to say that it depends on the encryption suite.br So my understanding is either a codeServerKeyExchangecode or a codeCertificatecode follows a codeServerHellocode.br So my question is, can the server authentication be omitted all togetherbr For example to omit client aunthentication in Tomcat, you just configure the connector to not request it.br How can the server authentication be omitted Does it depend on the java framework I use, if it supports itbr And what does it mean to omit the server authentication If the certificate is not send then the codeServerKeyExchangecode becomes mandatory, or usually frameworks allow provisioning of a local public key instead if one wants to by passauthentication phase for performance or because it does not make any sensebr Or does this depends on the encryption suite somehow, as wiki seems to implybr strongNOTEstrongbr I understand that server should always be authenticated. The context of my problem though is a client app and server running on the same machine and java runtime I guess so it can be considered safe to bypass server authentication I think.  p  pAny input is highly welcomebr Thanks  p

Negative 265 pI have a data warehouse based on Postgresql. p  pUntil now, I have been trying to run queries on a database containing just a fraction of my real database. Once I have written the queries in a way that make them efficient for this small test database I run the queries on the real one. p  pThe problem is that once I run the queries on the real database, the real database runs out of memory and starts writing things like indexes and temp tables to disk. This means that it could be that different queries would be optimal for for test database and the real database. Does this mean that I really have to run queries that take several minutes to complete in order to know, which query is the optimal one.p

Negative 265 pOriginal question is below. I fixed my problem.  I had the same view controller set for the tableview and the mapview.  AND I had all of my mapView init in viewDidLoad.  These both together made the following problems for mep  p1 When the tab bar controller was presented modally and I received a memory warning the viewDidUnload was called which I did nothing in before.  When the modal tab bar controller was dismissed and viewDidLoad was called, it reset my mapView. 2 When the tab bar controller was presented modally and I received a memory warning before moving to the tab with the view controller and then switched to that tab, my viewDidLoad was called in my mapViews controller which reset my map, AND it didnt reset the tables properties so that my tableView would not work.p  pMuch thanks to Anomie for helping me debug this issue, and gain a better understanding of how these pieces are all connected.  Things work great now, and my App has a better design.p  pOriginal Question I have an application that has a mapview and when I present a tab bar view controller modally, every once in a while when I cancel the modal view controller the map resets back to the world view like a reset button was pressed on it.

Negative 265 pI have an AutocompleteTextView working with an ArrayAdapter. The adapter is updated from a webservice, when the text changes.

There is a couple of problems related is this page, but none of the answers works for me.

What could be going wrongp  pIf thats an easy question to answer, I have a followup once Ive actually verified the request, how do I generate the request tokens  The codeoauth2code library is a little sketchy on documentation regarding this point, and most examples out there seem to be geared towards implementing consumers, rather then creating providers as well.p  pThanksp  pstrongUpdatestrong  Responding to my own question to give what I think is an answer.  From this a hrefhttpsgithub.comsimplegeopythonoauth2issues58 relnofollowbug reporta for codeoauth2code, it would appear that the inclusion of the codeoauthbodyhashcode parameter was messing up my signature verification since I was using codeGETcode.  Changing it to codePOSTcode fixed the problem.  Strange that this would occur anyway given that Im also emtestingem with this library.p  pAnd to answer the second part, I believe you can just generate any keysecret pair that is random and long enough.  Ive seen people split up sha1 hashes of some random source into two 20 character parts.  You can then us codeoauth2.Tokencode to automatically create the URL that you can then use in your codeauthorizetokencode step.p  pOf course, if Im wrong on any of this be sure to let me know.p

Negative 265 pI was wondering if there is a way to take an object in Visual Basic 2010 Express, FWIW and browse through its structure to visualize how the data inside is laid out.p  pFor example, I have an object called model that is populated by a function that is a black box to me. Model is set by a read function that loads a DXF file from disk. The read function isnt very welldocumented.p  pWhat Ive discovered is that model.Entities ends up containing a list of different objects, all with different properties. Id like to be able to simply browse this list of objects and view their associated properties and values at runtime, similar to how you can use Intellisense to view a list simply by typing blah. and waiting for the popup to appear.p  pA tree view that you can pop open and closed would be excellent. Obviously this has to work during runtime rather than in the editor because the file hasnt been loaded if the program isnt running.p  pIs this something thats possible in Visual Basic 2010 Is it a builtin feature I cant findp  pThanksp

Negative 265 pI need to prevent a certain application function from being run concurrently with itself.  The risk is significant because this function is in code submitted to java.util.Timer to repeat every minute for several hours and the process that sets up the function completes and goes back to the bash command line.  The user might then invoke the same program.  Another risk is from the user that has two or more console windows and they mistakenly run the program in both console windows.p  pI think an operating systemwide semaphore with a Java API might do the trick.

Negative 265 pIm working on a project that includes WebSockets, and data between the server Node.js and the client Chrome is sent using a custom very simple format for data exchange I set up.p  pIm sending data in pieces of 3 bits because Im sending items which all have 8 possibilities. The data format looks like thisp  precode            0          1 bit index   01234567 8901... item        aaabbbcc cddd... codepre  pCurrently, Im parsing the items out of the bytes like thisp  precodevar itemA  bytes[0] gtgt 5 var itemB  bytes[0] gtgt 2 amp 7 var itemC  bytes[0] amp 3 ltlt 1  bytes[1] gtgt 7 var itemD  bytes[1] gtgt 4 amp 7 codepre  pPersonally, this feels as being too sophisticated. The problem is that its only complex because Im getting data in bytes, which are a multiple of 8. To parse out items of 3 bits I have to bitshift, doing AND operations, and because 8 is not divisible by 3 I sometimes even have to combine parts of two bytes like for codeitemCcode.p  pIt would be much more effective to read this data as groups of 3 bits instead of groups of 8 bits.p  pWhat Ive come up with is converting all bytes into bits to a string using code.toString2code, then using code.substringcode to get a substring with length 3, and converting back to a number with codeparseIntbitString, 2code, but I guess thats not the way to do it, since string manipulation is slow and Im actually not doing anything stringrelated.p  pIs it possible to read bits in groups of e.g. 3 instead of parsing them from bytes Or is there a more efficient way to read bits out of bytesp

Negative 265 pI have two PHP classes. One is for connecting to the database, building queries, executing them, and disconnecting from the database. The other class is for users adding them, updating them, logging them in, etc.p  pIm debating whether I should connect to the database on the page globally and use that connection passing the database object into the method of the user object, or whether I should connect and disconnect from the database from within the a user method itself.p  pThe advantage I see for connecting globally, is that once connected I have that connection available for executing multiple methods. The disadvantage is that I 7need to worry about passing the database object around.p  pThe advantage of connecting within the method is that its completely transparent, however, there might be 4 or 5 connections established and disconnected, which may lead to an overhead.p  pIs there a best practice for using either, or does it really depend on the amount of users and the servers specs e.g. memory, cpu, etc. The system needs to support up to about 1,000 users, so its fairly small scale.p  pAny feedback would be much appreciated.p  pRyanp

Everytime I hit the home key and then reopen my app, it completely restarts my app. doesnt save state is something different in the debugging verison of the app Also note, if i install the app from eclipse, disconnect my device from the computer and run it that way, it still remembers the state like it should Only the exported copy will not work correctly.p

Negative 265 pI am trying to draw a linear CGGradient on an angle.

Negative 265 pI am using a hrefhttpen.literateprograms.orgMersennetwister28C29 relnofollowthisa implementation of the Mersenne twister for a diamondsquare terrain generator I am writing. The point of using a separate implementation rather than the built in rand is that I want the same seed to generate the same map every time. Diamondsquare requires a random error to be added on to every pixel, so I need to generate many, many random numbers from a single seed. Mersenne twister would be good for this, but as far as I can tell, this implementation generates only one random number. I have replaced the rand in mtinit with an integer argument. I can make no further head or tail of the code, however, so I must turn to you to ask what steps should I take so that mtrandomn returns the nth random number in the Mersenne twister series it belts outp

Negative 265 pHi guys i have been design a layout by making many sections such as header, footer, left panel and content panel and i have used the layoutweight property to divide the screen in the radio i need. And also i have pages which dont have any division of layout. The layout with several divisions takes more time to load while the other loads very much faster. Can anybody let me know why this is happening. Is this because of the slowness of the emulator, right now i dont have the tablet to test. Thanks in Advance.

Negative 265 pI am trying to learn how to convert a string to an integer. I think I am pretty close. My code works for numbers under 260. Once the numbers entered are greater than or equal to 260, then it just converts them to 0. I think it might have something to do with the size of a BYTE, but Im not sure how to fix it. Any suggestions Some Irvine functions are included, but Im trying to write my own ReadInt function.p

Negative 265 pMy file system contains a large number of folders, with the folder names in the format of 4 digits. Within each folder are varying numbers of files in different formats, with names corresponding to the folder name, some with letters andor dates appended to it. What I would like to do is search through each folder and if a year in the format 19 or 20 is found, create a folder labelled with that year. If the filename further contains the expression ED, create a subfolder with that label. Once all the folders are created, copy all files into their corresponding folders, and strip the names down to the first 6 characters.

Negative 265 pIm writing a server with boosts asio library.  The server handles many concurrent connections using a collection of Connection objects a wrapper class around boostasiotcpsocket.  Within the Connection class, the socket is constantly being read from using socket.asyncreadsome... and whenever the read handler is invoked with new data, socket.asyncreadsome is immediately called again for more data to be read.p  pNow, the server may decide to disconnect a client for some reason, so the natural thing to do is to call connection.close which in turn calls socket.close, which will cause all pending async operation to be canceled.  This causes the read handler bound to a method within class Connection to be invoked with boostasioerroroperationaborted.  And my problem is I dont want this to happen.p  pAfter socket.close, Id like to destroy the socket and the connection and then remove its pointer from the servers list of active clients.  However the read handler wont be called until the next iteration of ioservice.run, which means that I cannot immediately destroy the socket or the read handler I had passed to socket.asyncreadsome until the handler has been invoked with the error.  So I have to delay the destruction of those objects somehow thats annoying.p  pIs there a safe way to eitherp  ul liCancel pending async operations emwithoutem any handler to be invoked, so I can safely destroy the socket immediately after socket.close, orli lito safely know when no more handlers can potentially be calledli ul  pOr am I approaching this entirely the wrong wayp

Negative 265 pIve been searching for some information regarding microcontroller programming but the info I find is either way over my head or doesnt appear to exist. Im looking for something easier to digest Im relatively new to programming and come from an SQL DBA background and decided that it would be quicker for me to learn some programming fundamentals and then teach myself Delphi than it would to get some changes implemented through my companys insane design change note system    After a couple of years of Delphi programming I can cope with writing database applications without too much bother and I want to be able to move on a level.    We use PIC microcontrollers on our PCBs mainly the PIC18F family. The software on the PICS is written in C but there are parameters values  that are written to by a Delphi application that interface with the PIC using an ActiveX control.     Basically, SQL Database holds parameter info, Delphi client app retrieves those values, passes them to the ActiveX controll which does all the low level stuff on the PIC. For example the internal EEPROM will have a map and within any particular address a value will be stored to switch something on or off or hold an integer value etc.    Ive gotten hold of an MPLAB kit which has an ICD2 device that can read and write values to the internal EEPROM and I understand how to change these hexadecimal values using MPLAB software.     My hope isnt to learn embedded microcontroller programming rather that I can write a Delphi app that will do something similar to MPLAB software. E.g read and write values to certain memory addresses within the EEPROM.    Id be very gratefull if anyone can point me in the right direction of any libraries or components that may already exist for bridging this gap between simple Delphi form application and writing low level PIC EEPROM. I doubt such any easy interface exists but I thought Id ask. To summarise I want to be able to have a simple form app, with some edit boxes that the user types in or selects from dropdown boxes, parameter values, to click on a button and to assign those parameter values to specific EEPROM memory addresses. Thank you for reading and any comments would be gratefully received.p  pRegardsp  pKDp

Negative 265 pI have a Silverlight project which references a handful of web services. Each web service method returns a standard response wrapper object called codeGenericWebResponsecode. This class contains information about whether or no the call was successful, and some status codes if it failed to indicate why it failed. Common things are that the authentication ticket expired, or the user doesnt have permission to perform the action.p  pAnyway, whenever a web service call fails, I want to treat it the same way. I want to create a log entry, notify the user something went wrong, etc.p  pSince I have multiple services, each service reference generates a new instance of the same codeGenericWebResponsecode class. So I have codeProductService.GenericWebResponsecode and codeOrderService.GenericWebResponsecode, and obviously .NET treats them as entirely separate classes.p  pI want a way to write code against these objects generically. I know that the response will always be the same, but .NET doesnt know that. I get that. But is there some way I can write code against these objects so that I dont have to write an new version of my failure logging code for each service I havep

Negative 265 pIm making a PONG game for a school project using Kivy in Python. So far thanks to this forum Ive made myself some AI for the NPC paddle. This is the codep  precode    if self.ball.y lt self.player2.centery         self.player2.centery  self.player2.centery  4     if self.ball.y gt self.player2.centery         self.player2.centery  self.player2.centery  4 codepre  pThis is in a method of PongGame class called ArtificialIntelligence.p  pI use this to call itp  precodeClock.scheduleintervalgame.ArtificialIntelligence, 1300      codepre  pThis allows me to call it once every 1300th of a second. However, anything more than 1300, I seem to have no difference. I.e. 19001 does not call it once every 19001th of a second.p  pThe way it works is that it increases the y coordinate 4 pixels relative to the balls position, and it does this once every 1300th of a second, hence why it doesnt lag at this rate. This is basically an easy mode for the player. If I want to do a hard mode, I need to make the NPC more accurate. I can do this by doingp  precodeself.player2.centery  self.player2.centery  20 codepre  pSomething like this. This would be extremely accurate. HOWEVER, it does NOT look fluid, it looks laggy. I assume I could get the same amount of movement by emcalling the method more oftenem instead of changing the amount it moves via altering the pixel movement. However, I dont know how to do this, because, as I said, changing it from anywhere above 1300 seems to make no difference. p  pThis is how I use my paddlep  precodeif touch.x lt self.width3     self.player1.centery  touch.y codepre  pand I can move it as fast as I want because this updates as I move the mouse. And it looks fluid because it updates as often as it needs to update. I dont know how to do this with my AI.p  pDoes anyone know how I could basically make the NPC paddle more accurate, allowing me to do EasyNormalHard, etc, while retaining fluidity and no lag I see only one way I could do it Increase the amount the method is called. p  pHowever I bet there is a better way and I dont know how to do it. Does anyone have any Idea how I could do this Thanks.p  pEdit it looks like I can do it like thisp  precodeClock.scheduleintervalgame.ArtificialIntelligence, 1300      Clock.scheduleintervalgame.ArtificialIntelligence, 1300  Clock.scheduleintervalgame.ArtificialIntelligence, 1300  Clock.scheduleintervalgame.ArtificialIntelligence, 1300          Clock.scheduleintervalgame.ArtificialIntelligence, 1300  codepre  pBut that seems REALLY ugly and REALLY inefficient... Id MUCH prefer a cleaner way.p

Negative 265 pI want to write unit test for a class that contains linq to sql codes . I mean inside each method I have created a new DbContext and done database jobs .p  pI searched the web . first I came to use repository and Unit of Work patterns but I figured out that DbContext itself is a unit of work and its dbset works as repositories . another point is that I think there is no need to test Linq part because it works as it should  tested by .net team  . I want to test the logic I have added to the code . so I decided to create an interface with necessary methods with two implementations , one uses linqToSql while another is just a mock . something like this p  precode    public interface IDbManager              bool InsertMyEntity newEntity           public class RealDbManagerIDbManager              public bool InsertMyEntity newEntity                      using DbDataContext db  new DbDataContext                              db.MyEntities.InsertOnSubmitnewEntity                 db.SubmitChanges                                 public class MockDbManagerIDbManager              public bool InsertMyEntity newEntity                      return true               codepre  pis the whole idea correct  if so is this a correct implementation  p  pis it possible to define DbDataContext as a class variable instead of creating new instance inside each method p

Negative 265 pI have created an ASP.NET 4 based website.  At first I ran the default site as it was generated by Visual Studio ASP.NET 4 Internet Application template. I just hit the Debug button, and IE was launched, it connected to codehttplocalhost1341code and loaded the default welcome page of my website. Everything seemed fine, so I started to redesign the Index.cshtml.p  pAfter redesigning, I launched the website again. And while navigating, I noticed that if I click browsers Back button, I get the cached old version of the first page and I have to hit Refresh in the browser to get the new one.p  pSo I added p  precode    ltmeta httpequivPRAGMA contentNOCACHEgt codepre  pandp  precode    protected void ApplicationBeginRequestobject sender, EventArgs e               prevent caching         HttpContext.Current.Response.Cache.SetExpiresDateTime.UtcNow.AddDays1         HttpContext.Current.Response.Cache.SetValidUntilExpiresfalse         HttpContext.Current.Response.Cache.SetRevalidationHttpCacheRevalidation.AllCaches         HttpContext.Current.Response.Cache.SetCacheabilityHttpCacheability.NoCache         HttpContext.Current.Response.Cache.SetNoStore      codepre  pto my website.p  pThen I cleared the IE cache using IE Options. I also cleaned my LocalTemp folder.p  pBut still I got Result 304 in the IE developer tools Network tab when hitting Back button in the browser. p  pThe only way to get the new redesigned page is to use CacheAlways refresh from server. I could do that for development purposes, but it is just messing my mind up  where does it get that very old page from always when I hit Backp  pWhen debugging, in Visual Studio there appears a new tree item in the Solution Explorer. This new item is called Script documents. Under it, there is a Windows Internet Explorer item which contains localhost item ... and when I open it  yeah, thats the old page which is coming to IE when I hit Back button Where does Visual Studio or ASP.NET Dev server store that localhost pagep  pHow do I get rid of that stuck page and stop IE or maybe also the ASP.Dev server from caching my localhost front page How do I delete that old page for good p  pI hope, the new page wont be cached the same way, because I added   to it...p

Negative 265 pIts been a few years without working with dot.net and MVC and a week ago i decided to look at it for creating a business application for an idea I came up with. Alot happened since, MVC 4 and Azure. I really like Azure as it was fast and easy to deploy and will be easy to scale up if it hit off.p  pI found some topics on securing a WCF API using the Azure ACS and may have gotten abit narrow minded  atleast i vent down the path and created my solution in MVC 4. Creating a Website that also exposes and WebAPI. One week later I managed to get my site publised to azure with WIF enabled. Users can log in using ACS and the providers provided there.p  pToday i was looking abit around within MVC 4 and stuff that have been added since i last worked with MVC. Some nice features came along. I then discovered how it look like there as default are implementetenabled features to use OAuthWebSecurity and people could login and create users with their Social Networks Accounts. p  pSo have i wasted all my time getting ACS up and running together with WIF I ask myselfp  pCan anyone take a moment to talk abit about, or link to some topics that covers following What do i gain from using WIF and claim based authentication over just the OauthWebSecurity that have been setup as default in a MVC 4 Projectp  pI have been searched on google and read alot, and do have some basic information, but I would love to have the best practice or short facts summarized. p  pWill put a bounty on it to get some good answers when available, but feel free to answer before. p

Negative 265 pI ran into a small problem with floats that i demonstrate a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net5FFdf relnofollowin this fiddlea.p  pI have a DIV which floats to the left, whose width is dynamic unknown. I have another one that floats to the right in the same block, width dynamic as well.p  pThe problem is that if the width of the first block extends so that it would collide with the right float, the right float will correctly drop downwards to make sure no collision is happening. However, i want it to stay on top vertically, that is  not in terms of zindex.p  pBasically it seems that the text is prioritized as to displace the block on the right side. This should be the other way around, but with the text on the left using up the available space on the topmost line before it even starts to wrap.p  pI guess the solution is fairly simple. Its just that it doesnt come to my mind at all and any searches i did didnt find me what i was looking for.p

Negative 265 pI have an app which transitions from fragment to fragment as the user taps on tabs. One of these fragments has a webview in it. The issue I am having is that if the user has the soft keyboard visible and then navigates to the webview fragment, the webview is created in the wrong size. The webView gets created in a size as if the keyboard was still up.p  pI have tried to extend the webView class used by the fragment and try and set the correct size in OnMeasure. This does not help.p  pIt seems like there is something about a webView that does not make it resize correctly. p  pAnother hacky option might be to write a javascript interface class and have the javascript trigger a resizep  pWhat I am looking for is a way to create the fragment and the webView in the correct size but there is no easy way to know what the correct size should be.  Any ideas on how I can fix thisp

Negative 265 pI am implementing a flexible array in C. All ideas are based upon this small a hrefhttpscs.uwaterloo.caresearchtr199909CS9909.pdf relnofollowPapera. My error is with the indexing operation. Been hacking away for too long to admit. Asking for knowledgable minds and eyes.p  pstrongOverviewstrong The data structure consists of 1 flat index block which holds pointers to the data blocks. Each data block has size 2k2. Where k is the leading set bit. So when I search for element i, k is log2i1.p  precodeindex        [0], gt [0]     [2],  gt [0,1]     [2],  gt [0,1]     [3],  gt [0,1,2,3]     [4],  gt [0,1,2,3]     .... codepre  pThe size of each data block is determined by the super block it is clustered into. Where a super block is  made up of data blocks with the same size. So. index 1,2 are in the same super block super block 1. While 0 super block 0, and index 3 superblock 2 are not.p  pYou end up with each superblock having 2floork2 data blocks, and each of those data blocks has size 2ceilk2.   p  pstrongThe Problemstrong When r  a power of 2 the index skips over what is should be. Like when I search for 3 it should be codeindex [2][0]code, instead its codeindex[3][0]code.

Negative 265 pIm currently in the idea phase for a small application that requires keeping track of specific, user chosen files.p  pI want the system to be intuitive, such that a user can change the file name, directory name, or move the file to a new location, and the application would still be able to keep track of the file.p  pNow, I know that I can monitor directories already, for the majority of these kinds of changes, with windows system calls.p  pThe problem Id have is finding ifwhen a file is cut, copied, or pasted somewhere.

Negative 265 pI have a data set that contains a date and a number.  The dates are roughly a week apart, but this is not guaranteed.  I am trying to display the date as the Horizontal Axis label of a bar graph, but it keeps showing the dates in interval format.  I am using Visual Studio 2008.  I want it to be super simple.  I want an evenly spaced bar graph, that has a horizontal axis label with my date and the corresponding value.  If the dates are 2 to 3 weeks apart I still want the bars next to each other without any spacing.p  pIve tried converting the date to a string using Cstr to get it to handle the date as just an arbitrary value.  Ive tried playing with the interval settings.p  pI was going to post a screenshot of what I was working with, but Im not allowed to yet, so I will try to describe them.p  pThe one picture is of the format Im looking for.p  pThere are dates in the horizontal axis labels and for each date there is a corresponding bar above it with the value associated.  Each bar is evenly spaced.p  pThe Other image was of what Im currently getting. The date labels are evenly spaced, but the bars are not lined up with the dates.  Some of the bars are closer together then others, and there are more bars then data labels.p  pThank you in advance for any advice you have.p  pnote The datasets used are different sources.

Negative 265 pSo, I am trying to create a vertical navigation menu that includes a stack rows of navigation items. When one of these rows is selected, I want a menu to slide out from above and beneath and when the top of this sub menu reaches the bottom of the row that was clicked. These sub menus should also have a starting position where the sub menu bottom is equal to the related navigation item bottom, so that upon animate downward, it is immediately visible. p  pThis positioning, the stop and start points, can be seen in this fiddle   a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netpGfCX57 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netpGfCX57a. Just take note of the start and end points. The rest of the fiddle is broken due to the nature of positionrelative. p  pI thought that zindex could fix the pushing of the subsequent navigation items as you can see in the fiddle just linked... however that doesnt seem to work. It looks like only positionabsolute will enable the proper overlapping i.e. sub menu hides beneath the elements above it and covers those below it. Unfortunately, this has its faults as well. As you can see in this fiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netpGfCX60 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netpGfCX60a. You will notice that the starting position and ending position is always the same because Im using the same class every time. Although I could specifically position every single sub menu as its own unique ID, that would be very inefficient and difficult to maintain.p  pBsically, I need a mix of the two approaches... relative positioning for the startend positions and absolute to enable the proper overlapping.p  pHopefully this makes sense... I really need help. Im stuck with the two approaches and neither working. Its frustrating. p  pHere is my current jQuery codep  precode.row.clickfunction        make all siblings AFTER row clicked get this class to reduce zindex and allow the menu to display above these rows while still remaining below the rows above      this.nextAll.addClassrowZ     this.next.menu.show     this.next.menu.animatetop0     when menu is out, the row clicked is the header row, upon clicking this, the related menu and by default, all subsequent menus within animate back up and hide  .rowHead.clickfunction       this.next.menu.animatetop100     this.next.menu.hide   codepre  pAny and all help is greatly appreciated. Thanksp  pstrongEDITstrong New approach... menu within the navigational item, to allow it to have absolute positioning and be relative to the navigational item.

Negative 265 pWhy should you ever want something like this I want to track a single user that is mounted above the ground in a horizontal position.

Also I have set listener on the AsyncTask so that the activity gets notified when the the data is downloaded.p  pThe solution I have now is that I start the locationManager and when I get the location I start the download. I think if I could start this paralelly and somehow get notified when both are finished I could reduce the loading time.p

Negative 265 pCan you guys help me with some homework question Im stuck inp  pA local minimum in a full binary tree is defined as a node which is smaller than all of its neighbors neighbors  parent, left child, right child. I need to find a local minimum in a given full binary tree, which each of its nodes has a different number, in Ologn complixity time.p  pWell, since the requirement is Ologn then I tried to think of a way to go only through 1 path through the tree down to a leaf. Or maybe I could look only at a half of the tree each time in a recursion and this way it will do the logn.p  pSo say I have this in the treep  precode    70        77    60 codepre  pThere are 3 casesp  p1 the root is smaller than both the left and the right child then im donep  p2 the root is smaller only than the leftp  p3 the root is smaller only than the rightp  pThe above tree is case 2. So lets throw away the left subtree because theres no way the 77 can be a local minimum since its greater than its parent. So were left with the right subtree. And so on, until we find the local minimum.p  pProblem here is, when we throw that left subtree, we could miss another local minimum down below. Heres an examplep  precode                70                                77      60                               1    8    9    14                            3   4 5 6  2 7  15 13 codepre  pSo in this case, the only local minimum is 1, but we missed it because at the beginning we decided to search through the right subtree of the root.p

Negative 265 pI am currently looping through a range of dates and caching the codeEKEventscode and codeEKReminderscode associated with each date. The issue that I am having is that when I fetch the codeEKRemindercode, the API runs asynchronously. The issue is that I am needing to access the contents of that thread, from my current dispatch thread queue. I created a local variable and blockd it so that I can assign the contents of the API async to it, and then I wrapped the whole fetch invocation in a dispatchsync call, hoping that it would hold up my current queue until the async was completed but that does not happen. How can I stop my current thread until the async API call is completedp  pI provided two comments below in the code to show you the locations where I need to stop the code execution and wait.p  precode voidsetupCalendarCache       Dispatch the queueing of previous days to a background thread     dispatchqueuet previousDaysCacheQueue  dispatchgetglobalqueueDISPATCHQUEUEPRIORITYHIGH, 0     dispatchasyncpreviousDaysCacheQueue,          NSLogPreparing to cache previous calendar days.          int reverseYearsToCache  HZNUMBEROFTOTALYEARSTOCACHE  365  2         DEDateUtility dateUtility  [[DEDateUtility alloc] init]         NSCalendar calendar  [[NSCalendar alloc] initWithCalendarIdentifierNSGregorianCalendar]          dispatchapplyreverseYearsToCache, previousDaysCacheQueue, sizet i              synchronized self.datesOnCalendar                  NSLogsynchronizing calendar dates.

Negative 265 pIn an MVC4 web application using the Razor engine and entity framework, is it possible to create a template for use with the html helper Html.EditorForModel , so that entities with links to other tables are better displayed.p  pThe example I am working with is a DbContext containing two DBSets, Regions and Schools. There are many regions, and a school may belong to one region. Ideally I would like the editor for schools to show a dropdown of regions to select from. I would like to make a template that is generic enough so that I can just call the Html.EditorForModel helper and the form is generated in one go, and that I could make changes to the region or schools tables later on and for the changes to be reflected in the edit form without me needing to make alterations.p  pSome codep  precodepublic class MyContext  DbContext      public MyContext           baseDefaultConnection                public DbSetltRegiongt Regions  get set      public DbSetltSchoolgt Schools  get set       [TableRegions]     public class Region              public Region                      Schools  new ListltSchoolgt                   [Key]         public int RegionId  get set          [StringLength256]         public string RegionName  get set           public ICollectionltSchoolgt Schools  get set            [TableSchools]     public class School              public School            [Key]         public int SchoolId  get set          [StringLength256]         public string SchoolName  get set          [ForeignKeyRegion]         public int RegionId  get set           public virtual Region Region  get set        codepre  pI have created a partial view to create display the editor form, with the idea that I can pass in either a Region or a School as the view model.p  precodemodel object using Html.BeginForm                 Html.ValidationSummaryBroken stuff     Html.EditorForModel                 codepre  pI dont know if this is possible, but I would really like the new template to loop over the properties of the entity and detect if there is a linked table e.g. School contains a Region and display the list of regions in a dropdown.p

Negative 265 pWhen I write code for my small projects, I usually end up with small bits of reusable code which Ill include in future projects. What I have been doing with these is saving them in .h files and using a standard naming convention throughout that file. For example, my code for reading and writing bitmap files is called KBMP.h and every structure and function name is preceded by KBMP. Over time, I have collected several of these files which I use in my projects on a regular basis for tasks such as hashing, matrix manipulation, graphics rasterizing, noise generation, etc. When I create a new project I drag in copies of these files and include them. My impression is that while this gives the modularity I want, this is really, really bad coding practice. What should I do instead I know there has been a similar question on SO but it doesnt quite answer my situation.p

The table is strongchanged by   referencestrong...  emphasis addedp blockquote  pI have always interpreted this to mean that codesetkeycode creates an index, rather than physically rearranging the rows of the data table similar to indexing a database table. But if this was true then removing the key using codesetkeyDT,NULLcode, should remove the index and restore the data table to its original, unsorted order. This is not what happensp  precodelibrarydata.table DT lt data.tablea31, b13, c57 DT    a b c 1 3 1 5 2 2 2 6 3 1 3 7 setkeyDT,a DT    a b c 1 1 3 7 2 2 2 6 3 3 1 5 setkeyDT,NULL    a b c 1 1 3 7 2 2 2 6 3 3 1 5 codepre  pSo two questionsp  p1 If the rows are rearranged sorted, then what does changed by reference mean p  p2 What does codesetkeyDT,NULLcode do exactlyp
Negative 265 pI am iterm2 1.0.0 user.

Negative 265 pTalking with some game developers, they suggested that a performant OpenGL ES based game engine does not handle everything on the main thread.

Negative 265 pI am working on a project that would require using at least 3 cameras to take a picture of the same object at different angles.

Negative 265 pI have a complete database system that is primarily used with its own frontend software. This year our character generator only accepts XML data feeds, and I have found that I can query the database and create an XML file.p  pThe database is spread across about a dozen tables. I can get all the information I want to air from a 2 table query, but am afraid I will need 3.p  pMy first few queries bring up a codeRACEcode, each race has 2 candidates, but when I run the query it shows a record for each candidate times 2. So I have 2 rows titled codeRACE NUMBER 101code. Each row has BOTH candidates in it, their votes which are related by their unique candidate , and is in another table, precints reporting, vote percentage..etc.p  pI am trying to get one race within one ROW. One row, that will show the race title, both candidates, their votes, their vote percents and the precincts reporting.p  pThe query I have written isp  precodeSELECT   FROM dbo.[RACE]  INNER JOIN dbo.[RACE CANDIDATES] ON [RACE].[race number]  [RACE CANDIDATES].[race number]  codepre  pThis gives me a complete overview of all fields I am able to query, but they are showing 2 rows from the same RACE. Also, it shows the candidates unique  along with their  of votes. But again, these are all in 2 rows. The only 2 differences I can see in the rows queried is the candidates unique ID and their vote number. p  pI would like to get both candidates names, number of votes and voter percentage in ONE single row, so I can make it an XML PATH, in a single block. One race, all race elements under one XML category.p  pIt is driving me nuts. It is very hard to ask a question like this, especially on a subject like this. I have the database saved off as a code.bakcode file that I have been able to load on 3 different machines now, so I have that available if anyone would like to take a look. There is no confidential data within it, so I have no problem offering it up.p  pI have about 30 hours SOLID into this. I see hope, but then I end up back where I started.p  pUsually, I would just send the data line by line to the character generator serially, but our graphics system has changed since the last primary election. p  pIf anyone could give me an idea of what the right questions to ask would be I would appreciate it. This of course is for work and the whole weight of this data feed is on my shoulders, I am reaching out to where ever I can with a broken limb.p  pThanks for reading this.p

Negative 265 pI need to solve a problem which entails comparing two matrices with the same number of columns. One of these is manipulated until the best match is obtained. The way I score the differences between the two matrices is quite convoluted and I still have to finalize it. What Im really interested at the moment in is finding a searchoptimization algorithm that works with positive integers only. Ive created a simple example with a simple function to maximise. Lets say I have a dataset D.   p  precode D lt data.framerbindc1,1,1,                        c1,1,0,c1,1,0,c1,1,0,c1,0,0,                        c0,0,0,c1,0,0,c1,0,0,c1,1,0,                        c1,0,0,c1,1,1,c1,1,0,c1,0,0,                        c1,0,0,c1,0,1 codepre  pI want to find which rearrangement of Dx gives me the lowest absolute difference.p  precodeDxltdata.framerbindc1,1,0,c1,0,0,c0,0,0,c1,1,0 codepre  pSo I could go through all the possible permutations using the function belowp  precode    librarycombinat     SPACE lt tas.data.framelistpermn13     f lt functionx       ifanyDuplicatedxgt0return0       DistltNA       for i in 1nrowD         Dist[i]ltsumabsDx[,x]tD[i,]      returnsumDist applySPACE,1,f codepre  pand get the right result.However this has 2 disadvantages for the data Im actually usingp  ol liI have to specify SPACE all the possible column orders and li licodeapplycode goes through each possible permutations and calculates my error score. li ol  pBoth A and B become computationally difficult as the number of columns in my matrix increases. I think even keeping all the possible permutations of the numbers 1 to 14 in one R session is impossible on most computers.p  pAn optimization algorithm I found is grid search. This starts to address A. It means that I dont have to specify SPACE i.e. all the possible permuatations, so its one step in the right direction, as I want to look at much larger datasets.p  precodelibraryNMOF gridSearchf, replistseq1,ncolD,ncolD codepre  pBut obviously this does not address B, as it goes through each possible iteration. What if my dataset was very large, lets say 15 or even more columnsp  pKeeping in mind that my parameters can only be positive integers i.e. they are column numbers, is there an R algorithm that would allow me to find the best column order or at least a good approximation within a reasonable amount of time e.g. 12 days, when Im dealing with much larger datasets This may look like a silly example, but it emulates very well the problem Im trying to solve. Ive tried codeoptimcode with codemethodSANNcode, but got nowhere. Unfortunately I have very little experience so do let me know if you think this is an unworkable problem. Just to start with an easier dataset few rows but lots of columns problem, do you think its possible to find the best column order as shown above for D2 by using some kind of clever optimization p  precode   D2 DltcbindD,D,D,D,D ncolD DxltcbindDx,Dx,Dx,Dx,Dx examples  fc1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 fc13,2,4,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,1,14,15 codepre  pEDIT My main interest is in understanding how to use optimization algorithms that use a series of unique positive integrals basically ranks in the search process, rather than solving this particular problem. Ive used a simple example in this case so that its easy to replicate, but the two datasets Im comparing often differ in number of rows and other aspects which Im not detailing here....the distance function Im building handles this well so understanding how to  apply an optimization algorithm e.g. Genetic Algorithm was suggested below to the function f above using D2 is therefore my main problem at the moment.p

As stated before, this works awesomely with any 404 or 403 errors, but 500 errors completely ignores this and behaves in the default manner. I am pretty sure that this has to do with the registering of the listener service, but I cannot find anything that explains how to make it work properly.p  pstrongEDITstrong Below are screenshots of errors that are not being handled as expected. I notice on the one undefined variable the codedietestcode actually displays at the bottom, but on the ohter syntax error it does not display, even though both seems like they are being caught by Symfony2. Further testing showed that codedietestcode showed up, but die .exceptiongetStatusCode. ltlt did not. I am assuming that this is causing a second exception which I am not seeing, just like AccessDeniedException did not have this function call and I had to use codeinstanceofcode, but there are many possible errors that can come up with a 500 error, so how do I distinguish whether the error is one of thesep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comp8T1c.jpg altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5E8DP.jpg altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comV2MeV.jpg altenter image description herep  pstrongFURTHER EDITstrong On the error that did print the Test at the bottom, I noticed that when I do codecontainergttestErrorcode, I do not get the Test, at the bottom of the error, but when I do codereturn containercode, I do, even though both errors are ContextErrorException with undefined variable.p

Negative 265 pafter looking for a solution of a problem I may found the turning point and can define the problem. My code uses jQuery and Ajax and is triggered on a click on a table cell.

Negative 265 pSo I have a Tkinter application that I use at work.  I wrote another Tkinter application that I wanted to call from the main Tkinter application.  I know that Tkinter isnt thread safe, but Im not 100 sure what that means.  Does it mean that it can work, but it isnt guaranteed to work as written  Or should it just not work at all  p  pThe reason I ask is because when I run the code belowself.threadeasyimaging is triggered by a filemenu option, it works just fine.  So far I havent encountered any issues and both GUIs are operational so far as I can tell.  Is this because Im using subprocess.call to call the script  Im having a hard time wrapping my head around this because I know you cant use thread in a Tkinter app to do something like run a function while still being able to use buttons in the GUI, but for some reason when I use a thread to call the script with subprocess.call it does it just fine.  When I wrote it, I assumed it wouldnt work, but for some odd reason it does.  Here is an example of the code Im usingp  precodedef threadeasyimagingself      thread.startnewthreadself.starteasyimaging, EASYIMAGING1, 0  def starteasyimagingself, threadname, delay      time.sleepdelay have to have args for some reason I just did a delay of 0 seconds so I could use the tuple.     subprocess.call[cpython27python.exe, EasyImaging.py]  self.threadeasyimaging codepre  pI have only used this on a windows machine, but Im guessing that it should work on any OS.p  pEdit  The scripts dont have to interact at all, I just want to add my other GUI application into the filemenu so I can call it as a separate application.  If needed, Ill just use a Toplevel widget to recreate the application I want to call because it wont muck up the main thread at all.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 265 pI want to style my chart in BIRT Designer Pro such that I have a color gradient moving across the bars. I know this can be accomplished using the format chart editor and adjusting the series palette to have a color gradient, but this doesnt achieve quite what I want to accomplish. My chart looks like this currentlyimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiJRo7.png altenter image description here You can see that the gradient moves across all the bars from start to finish no matter how long the bars are. In reality, what I want to accomplish can be seen in this Photoshop render img srchttpi.stack.imgur.come1R4j.png altenter image description here p  pIn this image you can see how the gradient depends on how long the bar is and does not extend all the way between both colors of the gradient.

Negative 265 pI need some help in understanding the mapreduce flow, not theoretically, rather in reference with normal Java code snippet. Ive been reading tutorials, APIs, forums and other subject related matters regarding processing in hadoop the mapreduce. Im perfectly comfortable with the flow, the processing methodology of hadoop. The problem with my understanding is related to the mapreduce coding in Java. Ive read and tried some already available codes out there i.e., wordcount, etc. What Im not able to understand is the flow of the raw data into the Mapper amp the Reducer classes strictly in terms of Java codes, not the theoretical flow. p  pIll try to present it in terms of codes also may be I could make myself more understandable that way. Lets say the classic wordcount program the declaration of the map amp reduce class I found somewhere asp  precodepublic static class Map extends MapReduceBase implements      MapperltLongWritable, Text, Text, IntWritablegt  public static class Reduce extends MapReduceBase implements      ReducerltText, IntWritable, Text, IntWritablegt codepre  pstrongMy queries for above code snippetstrongp  ul liHow would I decide what all the 4 arguments type should be hereli lipThe APIs definition states its something likep  porg.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.MapperKEYIN,VALUEIN,KEYOUT,VALUEOUTpli lipIf Im passing the file through the command line to my program, in what argument the whole content go As per the understanding of hadoop flow, I say the first 2 arguments i.e., the KEYIN amp VALUEIN will be used. The keys will be the words while the values will be there counts whatever comes the output of the map phase.pli liHow do I declare if my key should be LongWritable or not. What if I declare only Integer type the first argument Im not talking about the difference between Integer amp LongWritable type, but the basic decision.li liHow would I decide what part of my problem should be in my mapper class and what part should be in reducer classli liShould the declared argument types in mapper amp reducer classes be the same or different Like in above declarations, they are different. How does that count The only answer I could guess is the map phase outputs intermediate values which might not be the same type as what was the input type to the map class. Not sure on this, so please excuse this explanation if absurd.li ul  pFor instance, I tried writing a small code to find out the greatest number in a small text file with comma separated integer values. First of all I couldnt decide where I should perform the processing in mapper class or the reducer class Looking at numerous codes around, I somehow reached to a conclusion that the processing should be in reducer class whilst I can apply some basic checks in mapper class to my input.

This makes no sense to me, because how am i meant to create cookies and assign data to it that is only acquired deeper in the page after html tag, take a look at my codep  precode            print ltimg srcimagesup.png onclickincreaseratinggt             print ltimg srcimagesdown.png onclickdecreaseratinggt codepre  pNow i wish to create something where, once a user clicks an image, it creates a cookie with the choiceie, rated up or down and also the id of the blog they voted onso multiple blogs could be voted..So if the user reloads the page they wouldnt be able to vote because a cookie would be set.p  pstrongWhat I meanthis obviously wont work, its almost my ideapseudocodestrong Its basically saying, if its already been clickedcookie has been set, then dont let them increment a rating or decrease its rating, by not running the function that does it.p  precode        if COOKIE[upclicked]             print ltimg srcimagesup.png gt             print ltimg srcimagesdown.pnggt         elseif COOKIE[downclicked]             print ltimg srcimagesup.png gt             print ltimg srcimagesdown.pnggt          else          if nothing is clicked             print ltimg srcimagesup.png onclickincreaseratinggt             print ltimg srcimagesdown.png onclickdecreaseratinggt          codepre  pCan someone help  me out Thanksp

Negative 265 pI am using pcreexec to apply some regexps that I read from a file. Since the regexps may contain repeat counts, like code[az]1000code, I would have to pass a match vector of 31001 integers to obtain even the first element, which tells me where the match startsends.p  pI only need the startend positions, not all the match group positions. And codepcreexeccode returns 0 which according to the manual means you need a larger match vector. p  pMy question is, how to I get the startend without passing an arbitrarily large match vector. Or at least, how do I know how large a vector I need to pass.p

Negative 265 pThis was originally the second part of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23922288marionetterendererunderscoretemplatesandinternationalizationwithi18nextan other questiona which I was able to isolate into its own question for better search indexing. It might be helpful to refer to it for more specific context.p  pMy question is  strongHow to elegantly inject a global view helper into all underscore templatesstrongp  pThis questions finds its inspiration directly from a hrefhttpi18next.compagesdoctemplates.html relnofollowi18next documentationa. It is too late in the project to switch to handlebars templates but I, by far, prefer the way it is handled with the coderegisterHelpercode style. Searching on that side, I came across a hrefhttplostechies.comderickbailey20120426viewhelpersforunderscoretemplates relnofollowDerick Baileys View Helpers articlea, which, as usual, provide a very neat solution to an inelegant problem.  p  pIn our architecture, we decided to reimplement serializeData for all our views and not rely on the default implementation exporting all the attributes from the model the view is bound with. My take on this one is if I wanted to get anything close to the registerHelper style, I would have to extend the base codeMarionette.Viewcode class and provide a basic helper that is injected into all the views, by inheritance.br This doesnt seem even close to the cleanliness of handlebars helpers, giving it working at all, which at this point seems nothing but certain.p  pProviding any examples or any hints on which path to follow to tackle this issue would be greatly appreciated.p  pThank you.p  pstrong[edit]strongp  pI found a solution to this exact problem, detailed in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23922288marionetterendererunderscoretemplatesandinternationalizationwithi18nextmy previous questiona. Simon also posted an answer that is also likely to work nicely.p

Negative 265 pLets say you need to store 4 different document types somewhere i.e, draft, sent for approval, approved, rejected. p  pYou can create a new table for that and store it there. But it seems a bit excessive to create a table just for 4 entries. p  pAnother approach is to create a one big table for all parameters in general and store them there. So if you ever in a need of storing 4, 15 or 2000 new parameters, you can just simply insert them into the Parameters table and store them there all together and not create a new table. p  pBut what if the number of parameters gets bigger Lets say, 1.000.000, 5.000.000 or even more What would be the best approach then p  pIm not talking about the particular database but if that would help, its either Oracle 12c or OpenEdge Progress database. p

Negative 265 pI am a Haskell novice. I am trying to create a minilanguage within Haskell, and would like if possible to have a higherorder function called codeoppcode short for opposite that converts a number of familiar functions into their obvious opposites. For example, codeopp succcode would be the function codepredcode, codeopp headcode would be codelastcode, and so on. I dont have some general definition of what it means to convert a function into its opposite I just want to pick a few key examples and declare what their opposites. So I want a highly polymorphic function that is hardly ever defined.p  pThe difficulty seems to be that I want to recognise the functions by their names rather than by their essences so to speak. One manifestation of that difficulty is that if I writep  pcodeopp succ  predcodep  pthen Haskell treats codesucccode as a variable and therefore gives me a constant function that always takes the value codepredcode. What I really want is to say something more like, If you ever see the string codeopp succcode then think of it as another name for codepredcode.

Is there a way to set up a flavor hierarchy such as this  Right now I need to duplicate lots of resources between the two in order for it to work and I would like to eliminate that duplication.p  pedit OK.  Ive had a couple answers so far both deleted that were not related to my question so let me clarify.  This does not have to do with Java OOP, I already know that quite well. p  pThe issue Im having is that I have a freepaid version of my app, and then several white labels that only include theme changes.  The paid version only changes a few assets from the free version apart from code changes.  This is what my codeproductFlavorscode look likep  precodeproductFlavors          whiteLabelA              applicationId com.whiteLabelA.android                   whiteLabelB              applicationId com.whiteLabelB.android                   mainFree              applicationId com.mainFree.android                   mainPaid              applicationId com.mainFree.android.paid               codepre  pI would like codemainPaidcode to override codemainFreecode since it only changes a few resources.  I would like to do it this way rather than a freepaid build type because the white labels dont have paid versions, and it would be easier to have a flavor hierarchy likep  precodemainPaid extends mainFree      applicationId com.mainFree.android.paid  codepre

Negative 265 pI am wondering if it is possible to test the eclipse workspace setup E.g. if you have multiple projects, like EAR enterprise appp  ul liWAR1 dyn. web projectli liWAR2 dyn. web projectli liWAR3 dyn. web projectli liUtilJar1li liUtilJar2 li liEJB1li liEJB2li li...li ul  pIt is very odd to ensure that all changes will work on the local IDE. For the build system itself you can easily integrate it into Jenkins or any other CI. But how can I integrate eclipse to be tested also if changes of developer will not break the local build for an developer E.g. are there eclipse ant tasks or a API, which can be integrated into a build, so we could run eclipse also in a CIp  pOr are other ways to ensure that the local build will run same as the build on jenkinsp

Negative 265 pI am developing a hospital searching app. my hospital location data is from google map api url return type is JSON. so i managed displaying all the pins with subtitles on apple map well, i know that is quite weird choice but i realised i am using apple map with google data afterwards. now the problem is i cant find out a way to display driving route from my current location to any pins on the map. i want to let the user click a button in annotation callout and display the route.    The tutorials i found online are mostly just teaching you how to display a route on map. Pls let me know if you have any good ideas or sample projects i can follow. p  pps. 1 i can switch to any other map apis is you have good ideas.p  pps. 2 sorry i am quite a newbee to objectivec so pls let me know if you have any examples with detail instructionsp  pthanks in advancep

Negative 265 pIm looking for a way to parse unicode strings of html and essentially split all of the elements of the string html elements as well as individual tokens and store them in a list. codeBeautifulSoupcode obviously has some nice functionality for parsing html, such as the code.gettextcode method, but this doesnt preserve the tags themselves.p  pWhat I need is something like this. Given an html unicode string such as p  pcodes  ultbgtThis is some important textltbgtcode, p  pwhat I would like to have as a result is a list like thisp  pcode[ltbgt, This, is, some, important, text, ltbgt]codep  pThere must be an easy way to do this with BeautifulSoup that Im just not seeing in SO searches. Thanks for reading.p  pbEDITb since this has been getting some questions as to the purpose of storing the tags, Im interested in using the tags as features for a project in text classification. Im experimenting with using different structural features from an online discussion forum in addition to the ngrams present within forum posts.p

The users need to be able to flag each of them as needing attention in some way.p  pSo I thought I would create this interfacep  precodepublic interface IFlaggable      [Required]     Tally Tally  get      Guid TallyId  get   codepre  pand these classesp  precodepublic class Flag      public Guid Id  get internal set      [Required]     public Tally Tally  get internal set      public Guid TallyId  get internal set      [Required]     public User Creator  get internal set      public Guid CreatorId  get internal set      [Required]     public FlagIndication Indication  get internal set    public class Tally      public Guid Id  get internal set      public IFlaggable Subject  get internal set      public ICollectionltFlaggt Flags  get internal set   codepre  pFlagIndication is an enum if thats not obvious.p  pThen all the other domain objects have to do is implement IFlaggable and they become flaggable.p  precodepublic class TestFlaggable  IFlaggable      public Guid Id  get internal set      public Tally Tally  get internal set      public Guid TallyId  get internal set   codepre  pSeems great. In terms of DB it should work just fine in that its a one to one relationship and the other tables would always contain a foreign key to the id field of the Tallies table.p  pTrouble is that Entity Framework takes a look at the interface and chokes. Obviously. We know Entity Framework doesnt play well with interfaces.p  pThe only way I can see to make it work with Entity Framework is by scrapping the interface, creating child classes such as TestFlaggableTally that inherit from Tally and then each other object can have its own special snowflake Tally class.p  precodepublic class Tally      public Guid Id  get internal set      public ICollectionltFlaggt Flags  get internal set    [TableTestFlaggableTallies] public class TestFlaggableTally  Tally      public TestFlaggable Subject  get internal set    public class TestFlaggable      public Guid Id  get internal set      public TestFlaggableTally Tally  get internal set      public Guid TallyId  get internal set   codepre  pThat should work but it seems silly and bloated.p  pSo, Im here to ask. Is there a better wayp  pDo I have some fundamental misunderstandingp  pIs that my best optionp  pok, hit mep

Negative 265 pI recently discovered something that bugs me...p  pI use RANMAR algorithm to generate random number. It is said that it is the best algorithm currently available if you know a better one, please let me know.p  pI was really surprised to notice that the smallest double it can generate is roughly 1e8.p  pSo I tried with codestdrandcode with the common p  precodedoublerand  RANDMAX codepre  pway of generating double and I noticed that the smallest number is roughly 1e9. I kind of understand that in this case because code1.0RANDMAXcode is roughly code1.0231  1e9code on my computer, I know that codeRANDMAXcode can have different values.p  pI was therefore wondering if it was possible to generate random double between code[01]code with the smallest possible value beeing near machine precision.p  p[edit]p  pI just want to be more precise... when I said that the smallest number that was generated was of the order of code1e9code, I should also have said that the next one is code0code. Therefore there is a huge gap infinity number of numbers between code1e9code and 0 that will be considered as code0code. I mean by that if you do the following test p  precodedouble xis a value computed somehow in your code that is small 1e12 ifxgtrand will be true for all random number generated that are below 1e9 codepre  pSo the condition will be true for too many numbers...p  p[edit]p

Negative 265 pOk guys sorry if the code tag doesnt work I havent been on Stack Overflow in sometime.  Anyways here is the issue Im having, and Im pretty sure I know whats going on but I could use some help.  The code below Im basically opening an excel workbook that will be storing filepaths to different workbooks on my computer, im placing them into an array.  The array is storing the data properly by the debug message box im using, but when it gets to the line Set tempBook  filePathArrayi, 1 I get the errror 424 Object Required.  Now I know for a fact that the item in the array Im looking at in the Set tempBook line is looking at a filepath.  My theory is that information stored in the array may have special formatting which isnt allowing the Set tempBook to recognize the string as a filepath.  Sorry if this is really simple, this is my first time working with VBA and macros I much prefer Java and C.  Anyway guys and girls any help woudld be greatly appreciated.  Also for security I change the file path info for the filePathBook before posting.p  pTo recapp  pIm retrieving file path information from a workbook on my desktop and storing it into an array, each cell in that workbook is holding a full filepath to the workbookp  pIm then running a loop that will go through the array, 1 item at a time during the loop, and trying to pull each file path out individually, get some data, and then do it again with the next file path in the array.p  pThe error Im getting is when it gets down to trying to pull the first file path out of the array and place it into a variable that is set to be a Workbook im getting error 424 Object Required.p  pI have a debug message box in place so i know the location being looked at is housing the proper file path information, but I believe the array formatting may be causing a problem.p  pAny help to alleviate this issue would be greatly appreciated.p  precodeSub getdatafromfile  Dim actBook As Workbook         active workbook Dim filePathBook As Workbook    filepath workbook  Dim pasteCounter As Integer     paste counting variable in loop Dim counter As Integer          loop counter   This sets the workbook the macro is in to be the active workbook to paste too Set actBook  ActiveWorkbook  Turn off screen update to speed up macro and make it not seem like the screen flashes Application.ScreenUpdating  False  set the filePathBook to point to the workbook storing the file paths for other books Set filePathBook  Workbooks.OpenCdirectory infofilePathBook    Dim filePathArray As Variant    declare array  retrieve data from range cells and store in array, these are the file paths for other books filePathArray  filePathBook.SheetsSheet1.Rangea1a2.Value  Save and close filePathBook filePathBook.Save filePathBook.Close  pasteCounter  1    initialize paste counter variable, its used to move cell paste locations  declare another workbook to use as the temporary variable in the loop to open and retrieve info from each workbook in the array Dim tempBook As Workbook  Looping structure to look at array and perform functions.

Negative 265 pI have been tasked with developing a method for importing text files with 1 million or more rows into a table. Each row within the table is 856 Bytes, split into approximately 150 columns of data. I am using SQL Server 2012 Standard Edition. The activity related to the INSERTs is the only activity on the database. I have built a stored procedure that does the followingp  precodeGET LIST OF UNIMPORTED DATA FILES IN A SPECIFIC DIRECTORY LOOP THROUGH LIST OF FILES     BULK INSERT INDIVIDUAL FILE DATA INTO DISKBASED TEMP TABLE     LOOP THROUGH RECORDLEVEL DATA IN TEMP TABLE     PARSEWRITE RECORDLEVEL DATA TO DETAILRECORD TABLE     IF ALL RECORDS FOR A GIVEN FILE ARE SUCCESSFULLY WRITTEN TO THE DETAIL RECORD TABLE         THEN              MOVE FILE TO IMPORTEDFILES DIRECTORY             WRITE SUCESS RECORD TO IMPORTLOG TABLE         ELSE             WRITE FAIL RECORD TO IMPORTLOG TABLE             MOVE ON TO NEXT FILE codepre  pThe BULK INSERT of the raw text file into the TEMP TABLE is fast enough, at less than 1 minute. However, I need to parse that raw data and put the data into its destination table. To be clear, that means, for example, that data from row location 110 should be written to  in the destination table, 1113 should be written to  in the destination table, etc. I am doing this by using a WHILE loop instead of a CURSOR and looping through each of the 1 million rows, then passing the raw data as a parameter to another stored procedure that then parses the raw data and inserts into the destination table. I am parsing the raw data simply by using the SUBSTRING function, i.e. SUBSTRINGrawdata,1,10. And as I mentioned, there are approximately 150 fields within each row. Performance of the parsingwriting step is terrible, however. Its has taken 10 hours to import 170K rows. p  pThere are no clustered indexes on the destination table.

Negative 265 pI am sorry for asking this guys, but this problem has been the bane of my existence for a week. I should have been able to figure it out by now, but I cant seem to get it to work. What I need to do is code for a personality test. Its based on this circlep  precode                            1                         10        2                       9               3                       8               4                          7         5                              6         codepre  pSo I already have my inputs given to me. I have three of them type1, pVec1, and subType1. pVec is a vector that I am assuming I have to index. type1 is given to me as either my dominant or recessive trait. What I have to do with that, is determine what my other traits are. If they gave me my dominant trait, the first letter would be capitalized. If its recessive, its lowercase. Dominant and recessive traits are always opposite of one another. If I have a dominant personality type 3, my recessive would be type 8 using the circle. Furthermore, my wing personality types are based off of my dominant type. They are the numbers to the left and right in this case, 2 and 4 would be my wing personality types.The subtype just tells me whether or not to add something about my dominant type. p  precode Test Cases       type1  helper       pVec1  [Reformer Helper Achiever Individualist Dreamer Investigator                    Loyalist Enthusiast Challenger Peacemaker]     subType1  alone [dom1, rec1, wings1]  personalityTesttype1,pVec1,subType1       dom1 gt Loyalista       rec1 gt Helper        wings1 gt Enthusiast Investigator codepre  pSo I have to get it to do stuff like that.

Negative 265 pIm planning to start using Guice to implement DI in my webapplication project.p  pLooks like Guice only supports Singleton servlets or newinstanceperrequest servlets. Is there a way to use a pool of servlets like regular JavaEEp  pAlso, does having a pool of servlets have any advantage over just creating an instance for each request. Why to even pool servlets... they seem to be quite light weight to instantiatep  pDoes it matter if servlet instantiation code is heavy If I have a stateless servlet could I just forget pooling and create one per requestp  pShould all servlets ideally be completely stateless not even initialisation parametersp
Negative 265 pI have used stdmutex extensively in my codebase. However, one of the classes simply does not let me add a mutex to its instance variables list. I am instantiating the mutex quite simply using the following  p  precodestdmutex myMutex codepre  pI added the above statement to the private section of the classs members list.p  pI get the following error p  precodeerror C2280 stdmutexmutexconst stdmutex amp  attempting to reference a deleted function 1gt CProgram Files x86Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0VCincludemutex113  see declaration of stdmutexmutex codepre  pThe class I am trying to add the mutex gets copied.p  pAs I said, I have used mutex all over my codebase, so it is very strange that I cannot instantiate the mutex in one place while I can instantiate in all other places. Can you please tell me what is going wrong herep

Negative 265 pI am attempting to loop through a set of records containing IPs for users. I am using the freegeoip.net API service for geolocation. Inside of the users table, Ive stored IPs from users of the application and now Im interested in updating all records individually by making a call to the API, having it return JSON content that I fetch with filegetcontents and then input into 2 fields based on the key i.e. city, regionname AKA state.p  pExample of sample data being returned from API a hrefhttpfreegeoip.netjson relnofollowhttpfreegeoip.netjsonap  pI have essentially 3 columns [ip], [city], [state]p  pI have the IP data populated.p  pBelow is the beginning of my PHP code which is a modification of my SELECT methods.

Negative 265 pIm learning about class composition but Im having a hard time understanding how the syntax works.  I have two classes, Time and Date, and Date is composed with a Time object.  I cant get the Date constructor to work correctly  there is a compiler error stating default argument  cannot convert from int to Time and Im not sure how to correctly set this up.  Im trying to pass a default value of 0, 0, 0 to the Time object.p  pHeres my two class headers.

Negative 265 pI have used NSDirectoryEnumerator to enumerate files in a Cocoa App OSX. I am able to identify many properties of files e.g that a file is a directory or not, its creation date,modification date etc using NSURL File Property Keys. What I am not able to identify is that whether a file is a package or not  I have gone through every bit of NSURL,NSFileManager reference but I have not been able to find a way. Am I missing something p  pI have also seen that for a file that is a package NSURLIsDirectoryKey returns true. But in my case I still want to categorise directories and packages separately.p

Negative 265 pIm trying to detect horizontal and vertical lines in image by using codeHoughLinesPcode function in OpenCV. Initially Ive set coderho  1code, codetheta  CVPI  2code and codeminLineLengthcode to the minimum expected line length.p  pBut it turned out that my lines could occupy more that one line of pixels on the image sometimes they could get shifted back and forth by one pixel due to some noise in the image this is illustrated in the attachment. In this case the line becomes split into many shorter segments and therefore could not be detected.p  pIve tried to set coderho  2code to decrease the accumulator resolution, but it didnt solve the problem.

Once the function is finished, this value is assigned to codesocketobjgtclientfdcode and then, emthe assignment operationem is evaluated if it is lower then 0.p  pBut wouldnt it be always higher then 0 since the boolean result of an value assignment is always true I mean, wont the following line always return truep  precodeif myVariable  0 codepre  pI first thought this was a coding mistaken and changed the code so the assignment first occurs and later the value inside codesocketobjgtclientfdcode is evaluated against 0, but then I found another place in the code where the same situation occurs, so I cant assume its an isolated mistake. p  pIld like to know, then, if my interpretation is correct.p

Negative 265 pIm using woocommerce on my WP site and i have two problems. I tried really googeling about it and i couldnt find answer.  First is In settings there is button enable ajax for add to cart on archive page and that is ticked but it doesnt work S  No matter what i do it always refreshes web page and puts in query string to add to cart. This works only on tab with suggested or simmilar products, then when i click on add to cart in listed simmilar products it adds to cart over ajax. I noticed class changes so i made loading bar and stuff according to them. But it just wont work on archive page S  Any ideas p  pSecond problem is, i have p  precode                           woocommercebeforeshoploop hook                             hooked woocommerceresultcount  20               hooked woocommercecatalogordering  30                           doaction woocommercebeforeshoploop  codepre  pin archiveproduct.php and that i assume calls catalog ordering. And catalog ordering appears on page but nothing works when selecting options. Its just like inactive select box and thats it. This is my second issue. Im trying to solve this for two days without luck. Any help appriciated. Thanksp
Negative 265 pIm using PreloadJS as part of an application thats being built with the CreateJS libraries.  PreloadJS is being used to pull in graphics and audio files listed in a manifest.  Ive setup a progress bar and hooked the preloaders codefileprogresscode and codefileloadcode events to update it.  Im getting progress updates as the images load, so I can see the progress bar crawling along, but I never get codefileprogresscode updates for the audio files, just the codefileloadcode file is completely loaded so the progress bar sits idle and then suddenly jumps to 100.  Since the audio files are by far the largest assets, this creates something of a problem as far as providing meaningful load progress to the user.p  pIve looked at the a hrefhttpwww.createjs.comDocsPreloadJSmodulesPreloadJS.html relnofollowdocumentation for PreloadJSa and it indicates that XHR loading is the preferred method because it does provide the progress updates, but that PreloadJS can fall back on things like tagbased codeltaudiogtcode loading of audio files.p  pNone of the file loading is local or cross domain, so it would seem to me that PreloadJS ought to be using XHR.p  pIs there a way to force PreloadJS to use XHR for everything so I can get consistent progress updates or why would I not be getting progress events for these much larger filesp

Negative 265 pI have created a template for a website that Im working on, and with the CMS I use, Im unable to set a different ogimage for every page  its gotta be the same ogimage for all pages or however many ogimage tags I want to add to be available across the whole site.

Is there a way to do thisp
Negative 265 pI am running a Django application on my production server using apache and modwsgi. I have a test code that returns a simple HttpResponse. The problem is, sometimes I get the expected response and sometimes the page just keeps loading. Restarting the apache server seems to have no effect. Although, when I change the name of the url and the view function, it seems to start working fine again for sometime and then I start having the same problem again. I am not sure if there is some kind of caching being done on my server. p  pI found the following post which seems to mention a similar problem.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1904505djangofailssometimesveryerraticbehaviordjango fails, sometimes, very erratic behaviorap  pThis problem has been troubling me for a very long time now and have not found a logical solution.

Negative 265 pSo I have this simplified table from which Id to choose rows to process. The whole table is wrapped in a form, the submit action is controlled via javascript. I already found out, that when the formrow contains only the checkbox as in form simple, only the checked items will be passed in the POST action. With additional input fields added to the row as in form multiple, all rows including the nonchecked will be passed. From some days ago I think I remember that by that time I had multiple fields per row and only the checked ones were passed, but I cannot reproduce that any more.p  pWhat would be the best way to process only the checked rows Have a JQuery capturing the checkbox.change event and have that add or remove an JSON object which will get passed by the POST action Or try to reproduce my previous code with which I think it worked Or forget the whole idea and have the PHP page processing the POST data loop over the form data and skipping the nonchecked But in large forms with only a few rows checked, that feels like a waste of resources.p  precode    ltform methodPOST namemultiplegt     lttablegt     lttrgt         lttdgtltinput typecheckbox valuea namea[id]gtlttdgt         lttdgtalttdgt         lttdgtdescription alttdgt         lttdgt...lttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgtltinput typecheckbox valueb nameb[id]gtlttdgt         lttdgtblttdgt         lttdgtdescription blttdgt         lttdgt...lttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         ...     lttrgt     lttablegt     ltformgt      ltform methodPOST namemultiplegt     lttablegt     lttrgt         lttdgtltinput typecheckbox valuea namea[id]gtlttdgt         lttdgtalttdgt         lttdgtltinput typetext valuedescription a namea[description]gtdescription alttdgt         lttdgt...lttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgtltinput typecheckbox valueb nameb[id]gtlttdgt         lttdgtblttdgt         lttdgtltinput typetext valuedescription b nameb[description]gtdescription blttdgt         lttdgt...lttdgt     lttrgt     lttrgt         ...     lttrgt     lttablegt     ltformgt codepre

Is that correctp  pI ask this question its because I saw below code snippet from Apples documentation a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationSwiftConceptualSwiftProgrammingLanguageControlFlow.html relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationSwiftConceptualSwiftProgrammingLanguageControlFlow.htmla the last part of the pagep  precodelet finalSquare  25 var board  [Int]count finalSquare  1, repeatedValue 0 board[03]  08 board[06]  11 board[09]  09 board[10]  02 board[14]  10 board[19]  11 board[22]  02 board[24]  08 var square  0 var diceRoll  0  gameLoop while square  finalSquare      if diceRoll  7  diceRoll  1      switch square  diceRoll      case finalSquare          diceRoll will move us to the final square, so the game is over         break gameLoop     case let newSquare where newSquare gt finalSquare          diceRoll will move us beyond the final square, so roll again         continue gameLoop     default          this is a valid move, so find out its effect         square  diceRoll         square  board[square]       printlnGame over codepre  pNote this statement codecase let newSquare where newSquare gt finalSquarecode, the codenewSquarecode is defined by codeletcode in this codecasecode statement. The codewherecode is using codenewSquarecode directly, and it seems the codeletcode part is first executed then the codewherecode part. This is not what Ive understood about it. Can anyone help to clarify pleasep

Negative 265 pIm trying to create a view hierarchy similar to what youd expect in a media playback viewer like the QuickTime Player p  precode Host View    Video Controls NSView layerbacked    Video View NSView layerhosted      AVPlayerLayer codepre  pSince layerhosted views cannot contain subviews, the video controls view is a sibling of the video view and simply orderedfront so that its on top of the video view. p  pThis current view hierarchy appears to be working fine for me, but I remain a bit confused over whether its officially supported because of the overlapping, sibling views the video controls view always overlaps the video view. p  pThis Stack Overflow question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions466297Is there a proper way to handle overlapping NSView siblingsa offers conflicting information regarding overlapping sibling views.p  pI would assume the more correct way to handle this is for the video controls to be a subview of the video view, which is only possible of I change the video view from being a layerhosted view to a layerbacked view. p  pBy default a layerbacked view uses a basic codeCALayercode as its backing store, but codeNSViewcode exposes codemakeBackingLayercode to allow you to return a custom layer such as an codeAVPlayerLayercode. p  pBy doing that, and moving the controls view to be a subview of this layerbacked video view, things also appear to work properly but now theres an codeAVPlayercode object that is directly modifying the contents of the codeAVPlayerLayercode. That seems to be contrary to the requirement that in a layerbacked view, you should never modify the contents of the layer without going through the codeNSViewcode using something like codedrawRectcode or codeupdateLayercode. p  pThis seems to leave me with two choices, neither of which appears correct based on my interpretation of the document p  pstrongOption 1strongp  ul liLayerhosted view for the codeAVPlayerLayercodeli liOverlapping sibling view for the controls view. li ul  pstrongOption 2strongp  ul liLayerback view with an codeAVPlayerLayercode via codemakeBackingLayercodeli licodeAVPlayercode that directly modifies the contents of the codeAVPlayerLayercodeli liControls view as a subview of the video viewli ul  pIm inclined to think that option 2 is the more correct way and that in this scenario, its OK for the codeAVPlayercode to directly modify the contents of the codeAVPlayerLayercode even though its in a layerbacked view, but Im not certain and would be curious if others have any thoughts or experiences with a setup like this. p

Negative 265 pIn a nutshell, we began with a single Spring MVC project. Call it proj1, so the package was codecom.foo.proj1code. Later, we based a second project on the same codebase, so we then had codecom.foo.proj1code and codecom.foo.proj2code. We then refactored common code into a library, as in a codecom.foo.libcode JAR to be used in both web apps.

Negative 265 pIm trying to add a new feature to my app, the app features Jobs from around the world.  Currently the user can tap on a tab bar button and see a list of jobs to choose from.

Negative 265 pI am trying to understand one thing about requestAnimationFrame.p  pIn the sample code below, I am running something 60 times, which should match the typical 60 frames per second that you normally get, so it should last 1 second. However, I have deliberately dragged it out by calling a time wasting function.p  pClearly, this takes longer about 5 seconds on my machine.p  pThe question is, how do I go about setting up the animation so that it lasts a fixed duration such as 1 second  presumably this should skip a few frames in the processp  pAlthough example sounds specific, it has a broader context. I would like to create animations such as fading or sliding which have a set duration rather than a set number of frames, since the frame rate is not totally predictable. This would match the behaviour of CSS3 animations.p  pThanksp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodevar i0 var startnew Date var end  var counterdocument.getElementByIdcounter var timedocument.getElementByIdtime  doit  function doit    ifigt60      endnew Date     time.innerHTMLend.getTime  start.getTime     return      wasteTime   counter.innerHTMLi    i   requestAnimationFramedoit   function wasteTime    forvar i0ilt100000000i codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltp idcountergtltpgt ltp idtimegtltpgtcodepre div div p

Negative 265 pI have created an object, lets call it EventObject, that will hold the results of an SQL query. Initially the objects will be aggregated into a single ArrayList. I am trying to develop a method that will look at each EventObject in the ArrayList, and if it equals a given value of a categorical factor, copies it to another group. p  pFor example, if a Timestamp value for EventObject1 falls on a Sunday, copy the object into a Sunday level of a Weekday factor if that same Timestamp falls in the month of May, copy it into a May level of a Month factor as well, etc. p  pI am stuck as to what type of data structures would be most efficient for sorting. I do not know how many EventObject will fall into a level of a given factor, and the number of factors to be analyzed will be dependent upon an ID I pass to the method. It is required that I will have K factors, each with a known number of levels and each level can have any number of EventObjects after the soring occurs. p  pShould I attempt to hold all factors together in a single ArrayList This requires a 3 dimensional structure. Would it be more prudent to create a separate data structure for each factor p

Negative 265 pI developed an audio group chat using PeerJS. Its working fine on Chrome, Firefox etc and hopefully on Opera too. Now, to make it work on IE and Safari on OSX, I used AdapterJS for Temasys, which asks the user to install the Temasys plugin, when their browser is not WebRTC compatible excluding iOS.p  pNow, if I open the chat page in IE, it shows the plugin install prompt correctly. But, if I install the plugin, restart IE and open the page again, the page keeps loading, but never completes loading, and sort of unresponsive. If now I disable the Temasys addon from IE settings, the page loads fine and again asks for installing the plugin.  If I enable the plugin, and remove the PeerJS codescriptcode tag from the page, then also the page is loaded fine, but obviously the audio chat functionality is gone.  The exact same thing is happening for Safari on Windows and Safari on Mac OSX.p  pI tried to console log at various points in AdapterJS, and it seems when the plugin is installed, and PeerJS is also included on the page, the pluginready variable is never set to ready and hence it keeps on loading.p  pPlease help me solve this issue.p

I already set everything regarding Json.NET to include and required in the Application Files dialog of the Publish settings. This did not fix it.p  pUninstalling 7.0.1 and reinstalling 4.5.9 all via Nuget however fixes the error.p  pWhy cant i deploy the 7.0.1 Version without this errorp  pThank you for your attention.p

Negative 265 pCurrently Im trying to record system lockunlock events on linux, under mono c. I was hoping to achieve this with the help of codedbuscode, using different components on different desktop environments. And I was able to do so on Ubuntu with Unity, using codeNdesk.DBuscode api, but it seems that theres no such signals on Xfce desktop. Ive checked codedbusmonitor typesignalcode there and it shows completely nothing useful on lockunlock. So, is there any crossdesktop way to record system events I also need loginlogout and active window changep

Negative 265 pIm using the a hrefhttpdocs.travisci.comuserdeploymentheroku relnofollowTravis integration with Herokua. My code.travis.ymlcode file looks like thisp  precodedeploy   provider heroku   strategy git   apikey HEROKUAPIKEY codepre  pEvery time some user triggers a deployment either by pushing to a specific branch or by running the build from the Travis UI, Heroku doesnt mark the build with the emreal userem that is doing the deployment. Instead, it marks the deployment as being done by the user that setup the integration. The cause of this seems to be that the integration is using the API keys user instead of the user that started the build process. So in the end, I end up with all deployments marked on Heroku as being done by the same user every time.p  pIs it possible to make Travis tell Heroku which is the emreal userem that triggered the buildp
