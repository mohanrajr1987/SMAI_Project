Positive 4126 pIm developping a WordPress plugin which adds a button to the TinyMCE editor. When that button is clicked the desired behaviour should be 1.

Positive 4126 pI have a button added to the WYSIWYG that opens a popup with fields to fill in. With those fields I am trying to add another button that will choose a file from the media library and insert the linkurl in a text field. I have the button working and it opens the media library, but when I select a file, nothing gets inserted into the text field.p  pIf I add an alert for json.url after the media selection it will alert me of the file link, So I know that it is getting the url from the file.

Positive 4126 pIm using tinymce wysiwyg editor to let people comment certain things, and I also want them to be able to quote each other messages in a simple way. Its hard for me to explain but Ill do my best.p  pI have an url that looks like codearticle.phpid1ampreplycomment1code and what it does it that it shows the article from the databse with ID 1 and let you comment the comment in the database with the ID 1. What I want it to do when I go to that link is that it would add codeltblockquotesgtcode around the comment you want to reply to, inside of the tinymce wysiwyg. I shouldnt have to tell people to add blockquotes manually... it doesnt seem right.p

Positive 4126 pI am the beginner in strongSymfonystrong. I am trying to enable strongTinymcestrong for the textarea. I have installed strongstfalcon tinymce bundlestrong. It works. Then I found the plugin strongJustboilstrong to upload images for the strongtinymcestrong. I have managed to configure it to upload images to the images folder. But when I am uploading images in tinymce they do not appear in the content. Image tag is added, the src points at codeimagesnameoftheimagecode  but it is not icluded.  I think the problem is with configuration of uploading in codeconfig.phpcode of the justboil  . p  precodeconfig[imgpath]  images  Relative to domain name config[uploadpath]  SERVER[DOCUMENTROOT] . config[imgpath]  Physical path. [Usually works fine like this] codepre  pI dont know what should I put here to make it possible for codeimg src..............code to include the image in the content through Tinymce.p
Positive 4126 pa hrefhttpwww.tinymce.comwiki.phpapi4class.tinymce.Editor relnofollowThe TinyMCE official documentsa have various events that you can catch when working with the editor. p  pOne such event that doesnt seem to come out of the box is the ability to catch the event after which an image is edited.p  pIn my implementation of image uploading, a URL to the remote image is simply returned and then displayed as an image, but if the user modifies that image, it gets converted to a blob, when really I need to catch the edit event so that I can reupload the edited image to the server in order to persist the changes. p  pHow would one go about doing this Of course you could perform the action on the submit event, but this caveat comes into playp  blockquote   pLocal images can be uploaded to TinyMCE through the use of the new editor.uploadImages function.  This functionality is handled asynchronously, meaning that it is possible for users to save their content before all images have completed uploading.  If this occurs, no server path to the remote image will be available and the images will be stored as Base64.p      pTo avoid this situation, it is recommended that the editor.uploadImages function be executed prior to submitting the editor contents to the server. Once all images have been uploaded, a success callback can be utilized to execute code.

Something likep  precodeselect C1, C2, C3 from T1 union all  select C1, C2, C3 from T2 order by C3 codepre  pThe parentheses came from valid syntax for other databases, and are needed to make sure the arguments to UNION ALL an operation thats defined to work on tables  i.e. an iunorderedi set of records dont try to be ordered individually.

Negative 4126 pIm doing the GUI for a paintlike program, where the user will be able to select a drawing tool from a ToolStrip. Some of these tools have variations, and Id like the user to be able to select one via a popup menu.p  pAnyone familiar with the Photoshop toolbar interface will know what Im after the user can either click the button and start working with the selected tool, or pick one of the tools from the popup menu that appears upon click, and from that point on the button will represent that tool. Also, the button will have the Checked property set to True when that toolfamily is selected.p  pI thought this could be accomplished with a SplitButton or DropDownButton, but these dont have a Checked property for the user to see what tool is currently selected. So I went with a ToolStripButton and a ContextMenuStrip that is shown upon click.p  pThe problem is that since Im taking the cursor position to show the ContextMenuStrip, depending on what part of the ToolStripButton is clicked, the popup menu might cover it partially, and it is a very unpolished look. How can I get the ToolStripButtons screen coordinates Or is there a better and still relatively simple way to do thisp

Negative 4126 pWe have all seen this type of code. A calls B, which calls back A, which delegates to C which does a few difficult to understand tests and depending on results calls a single method of D with different parameters, which has a big switch block all of which do essentially similar but slightly different things. There is most likely some polymorphism involved, possibly with a factory creating handler instances and registering in a map but it always always ends in a static method with a huge switch block. The call graph looks like a cats cradle gone bad.p  pI am looking for an English phrase that describes this.

Negative 4126 pA lot of the code base methods my peers have written perform their own error handling, usually by catching, notifying, and logging.p  pIn these cases the methods return a boolean, indicating success or failure.p  pSometimes though, if a method fails, I want the calling code to know why, and returning a boolean is not enough.p  pOne way around this is to keep the error handling in the methods, but make the method void, and have the methods throw their Exceptions.p  pHowever, recently Ive got into the habit of returning Exceptions in appropriate methods, usually action methods that could otherwise be void, but where Id like to know the status of the action.p  pThe advantages of returning an Exception over having a void method throw an Exception is that I think it makes it easier for other programmers to use your library, and, strongmore importantly, it means you can safely call that method without having to worry about catching the Exceptionstrongp  pFor example, if the method is just void, it might not be instantly obvious that the programmer should handle success or failure.p  pBut if the methods specifically specifies a return type of Exception, then you know you can check success or failure if you want to. But it also means you dont need to worry about catching the error if you dont want to.p  pDoes that make sense Maybe I havent used the best example, strongbut generally, is it OK to return Exceptions, or is there a better pattern out therestrongp  pcheersp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pwow, the overwhelming result is strongno waystrong.

Things that do not look like codea.b  c.dcode will remain in the where clause, but not all stuff that does look like codea.b  c.dcode look easy to convert into an explicit join. The difficult part is that ideally the conditions would be between neighbors  codeABCDcode, codeCDEFcode, codeEFGHcode, codeGHIJcode, codeIJKLcode but they are not that organized right now. I could reorder some, but ultimately I do not want to forget my goal I want the new query to be no slower, and I want the new query to be no less readable.

Negative 4126 pClojure truly piqued my interest, and I started going through a tutorial on it a hrefhttpjava.ociweb.commarkclojurearticle.html relnofollowhttpjava.ociweb.commarkclojurearticle.htmlap  pConsider these two lines mentioned under Setp  precodedef stooges hashset Moe Larry Curly  not sorted def morestooges conj stooges Shemp  gt Moe Larry Curly Shemp codepre  pMy first thought was that the second operation should take constant time to complete otherwise functional language might have little benefit over an objectoriented one. One can easily imagine a need to start with [nearly] empty set, and populate it and shrink it as we go along. So, instead of assigning the new result to morestooges, we could reassign it to itself.p  pNow, by the marvelous promise of functional languages, side effects are not to be concerned with. So, sets codestoogescode and codemorestoogescode should not work on top of each other ever. So, either the creation of codemorestoogescode is a linear operation, or they share a common buffer like Javas codeStringBuffercode which would seem like a very bad idea and conflict with immutability subsequently codestoogescode can drop an element onebyone.p  pI am probably reinventing a wheel here. it seems like the codehashsetcode would be more performant in codeclojurecode when you start with the maximum number of elements and then remove them one at a time until empty set as oppose to starting with an empty set and growing it one at a time.p  pThe examples above might not seem terribly practical, or have workarounds, but the objectoriented language like JavaCPythonetc. has no problem with either growing or shrinking a set one or few elements at a time while also doing it fast.p  pA [functional] language which guaranteesor just promises immutability would not be able to grow a set as fast. Is there another idiom that one can use which somehow can help avoiding doing thatp  pFor someone familiar with codePythoncode, I would mention set comprehension versus an equivalent loop approach. The running time of the two is tiny bit different, but that has to do with relative speeds of codeCcode, codePythoncode, interpreter and not rooted in complexity. The problem I see is that set comprehension is emoftenem a better approach, but strongNOT ALWAYSstrong the best approach, for the readability might suffer a great deal.p  pLet me know if the question is not clear.p

Negative 4126 pMost of you will realize this, but to me it came a bit as a surprise its way faster to sort for example 96 files each size 4Mb than 6 files of 64Mb using mergesort holding the total amount of information constant. I stumbled upon this finding by accident. So this begs the question, what is the optimal input file size for a mergesort p  pI assume that there will be a curvilinear shaped relationship between sorting time y axis and number of files x axis. Is there an algorithm, is it more rule of thumb or just trying a couple of different file sizes Obvious factors that will impact this are  max number of files that OS can open simultaneously.br  read  write speed of harddisk  p  pAny references are welcomep

Negative 4126 pI want to build a stateless web application using Java Servlets. Because its stateless, there is no HttpSession. There is a session in the browser, but each request might be handled by a different node in the cluster. The session identifier stored in the browser is generated and encrypted by the server, so its very hard for someone to craft a valid fake session ID and bypass login.p  pRecently I found a vulnerability in this architecture if a malicious infected browser sends the session identifier to a bandit, the session can be easily hijacked. I cant regenerate session identifier at each request because there is no session at the server to track the expected request sequence, and that would also complicate handling of asynchronous requests.p  pMy solution so far is to get some HTTPS session identifier and include it on the encrypted session ID that is stored in the browser. Can a standard servlet get such information from HTTPS connectionp  pAnother option would be using HttpSession just for getId, but that would work only if such ID is tied to HTTPS session, which I couldnt find in servlet specification.p  pOther suggestions are welcome.p
Negative 4126 pI have a dimension with two attributes where one can be listed as a child of the other in a hierarchy.

How do I get it to only list a unique value of attribute B once. It also lists it multiple times in the grid if A is not part of the MDX query. Ex Row headers B1, B2, B3, B1, B2, B1, B2, etc.p
Negative 4126 pI have an application that uses an API to get real time updates on the website. They use what they call a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPushtechnologyLongpollinglongpolling techniquea p  blockquote   pLong polling is a variation of the   traditional polling technique and   allows emulation of an information   push from a server to a client. With   long polling, the client requests   information from the server in a   similar way to a normal poll. However,   if the server does not have any   information available for the client,   instead of sending an empty response,   the server holds the request and waits   for some information to be available.   Once the information becomes available   or after a suitable timeout, a   complete response is sent to the   client. The client will normally then   immediately rerequest information   from the server, so that the server   will almost always have an available   waiting request that it can use to   deliver data in response to an event.   In a webAJAX context, long polling is   also known as Comet programming.p      pLong polling is itself not a push   technology, but can be used under   circumstances where a real push is not   possible.p blockquote  pBasically this enforces to make a request back to the server once youve got a response back. What is the best way to do this in an iphone application This eventually has to run in the background.p

And looking into overlay module and her js files I find it very scary and dont know how to avoid this. p  pI need some help on where to look into this for starters like me.p  pThank you very much.p

Negative 4126 pOk, so I have a client complaining about how a user who set their fonts too large in Chrome causes the site to render badlywhich it does. My natural reaction was to tell them that we could either shrink the font for them or they could just tell people to use normal fonts for their browser. I know that it is a good practice to try and make designs that accommodate as many browsers as possible, but there has to be a limit. People do some crazy samp. It seems to me that you have to tell people to just deal with it after a while or you will never be able to actually do anything that actually looks good for 99 of users.

My machine is an Intel x86 machine so its using the Little Endian rule.  Therefore for a variable m of int type, whose value is, say, 10, its memory layout might be like thisp  precodeStarting addr0xbf89bebc mbyte1 10                0xbf89bebd mbyte2 0                0xbf89bebe mbyte3 0                0xbf89bebf mbyte4 0 codepre  p2. The program above runs within the main thread.  When it comes to the overflowit function, the variables layout in the thread stack looks like thiswhich only shows the important variablesp  precode0xbfc609e9  temp[0] 0xbfc609ea  temp[1] 0xbfc609eb  temp[2] 0xbfc609ec  mbyte1 lt Note that m follows temp immediately.  mbyte1 happens to be the byte temp[3]. 0xbfc609ed  mbyte2 0xbfc609ee  mbyte3 0xbfc609ef  mbyte4 0xbfc609f0  t ...3 bytes 0xbfc609f4  i ...3 bytes ...etc. etc. etc... 0xbfc60a26  A15Result  lt Data would be written to this buffer in overflowit ...11 bytes 0xbfc60a32  tpTime ...5 bytes 0xbfc60a38  str    lt Note the str takes up 4 bytes.  Its starting address is 16 bytes behind A15Result. codepre  pstrongMy analysisstrongp  p1. m is a counter in overflowit whose value is incremented by 1 at each for loop and whose max value is supposed not greater than 6.  Thus its value could be stored completely in mbyte1remember its Little Endian which happens to be tempa hrefhttpgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocslibstdclatestdoxygena00954source.html3a.p  p2. In the buggy line When t is a 3digit integer, such as 109, then the sprintf call would result in a buffer overflow, because serializing the number 109 to the string 109 actually requires 4 bytes 1, 0, 9 and a terminating 0.  Because temp[] is allocated with 3 bytes only, the final 0 would definitely be written to tempa hrefhttpgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocslibstdclatestdoxygena00954source.html3a, which is just the mbyte1, which unfortunately stores ms value.  As a result, ms value is reset to 0 every time.p  p3. The programmers expectation, however, is that the for loop in the overflowit would execute 6 times only, with each time m being incremented by 1.  Because m is always reset to 0, the actual loop time is far more than 6 times.p  p4. Lets look at the variable i in overflowit Every time the for loop is executed, is value is incremented by 2, and A15Result[i] will be accessed.  However, if you compile and run this program, youll see the i value finally adds up to 24, which means the overflowit writes data to the bytes ranging from A15Result[0] to A15Result[23].  Note that the object str is only 16 bytes behind A15Result[0], thus the overflowit has sweeped through str and destroy its correct memory layout.p  p5. I think the correct use of stdstring, as it is a nonPOD data structure, depends on that that instantiated stdstring object must have a correct internal state.  But in this program, strs internal layout has been changed by force externally.  This should be why the assign method call would finally cause a segfault.p  hr  pstrongUpdate on 08262011strongp  pIn my previous update on 08192011, I said that the segfault was caused by a method call on a local stdstring object whose memory layout had been broken and thus became a destroyed object.  This is not an always true story.  Consider the C program belowp  precodeC class A      public         void Helloconst stdstringamp name             stdcout ltlt hello  ltlt name            int mainint argc, char argv      A pa  NULL      pagtHelloworld     return 0  codepre  pThe Hello call would succeed.  It would succeed even if you assign an obviously bad pointer to pa.  The reason is the nonvirtual methods of a class dont reside within the memory layout of the object, according to the C object model.  The C compiler turns the AHello method to something like, say, AHelloxxxA  const this, ... which could be a global function.  Thus, as long as you dont operate on the this pointer, things could go pretty well.p  pThis fact shows that a bad object is strongNOTstrong the root cause that results in the SIGSEGV segfault.  The assign method is not virtual in stdstring, thus the bad stdstring object wouldnt cause the segfault.  There must be some other reason that finally caused the segfault.p  pI noticed that the segfault comes from the gnucxxexchangeandadd function, so I then looked into its source code in a hrefhttpgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocslibstdclatestdoxygena00954source.htmlthis web pageap  precode00046   static inline Atomicword  00047   exchangeandaddvolatile Atomicword mem, int val 00048    return syncfetchandaddmem, val  codepre  pThe exchangeandadd finally calls the syncfetchandadd.  According to a hrefhttpgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocsgcc4.1.2gccAtomicBuiltins.htmlthis web pagea, the syncfetchandadd is a GCC builtin function whose behavior is like thisp  precodetype syncfetchandadd type ptr, type value, ...      tmp  ptr      ptr op value  Here the op means  as this function is andadd.     return tmp  codepre  pThere it is  The passedin ptr pointer is dereferenced here.  In the 08192011 program, the ptr is actually the this pointer of the bad stdstring object within the assign method.  It is the derefenence at this point that actually caused the SIGSEGV segmentation fault.p  pWe could test this with the following programp  precodeinclude ltbitsatomicity.hgt  int mainint argc, char  argv[]      syncfetchandaddAtomicword 0, 10     Would result in a segfault.      return 0  codepre

Negative 4126 pI can naively construct a hierarchy of algebraic structures in Coq using type classes. Im having some trouble finding resources on Coqs syntax and semantics for type classes. However, I believe the following is a correct implementation of semigroups, monoids and commutative monoidsp  precodeClass Semigroup A  Type op  A gt A gt A  Type     opassociative  forall x y z  A, op x op y z  op op x y z .

Class AbelianMonoid M  Monoid  Type     opcommutative  forall x y  A, op x y  op y x . codepre  pIf I understand correctly, additional parameters e.g., the identity element of a monoid can be added by first declaring codeMonoidcode an instance of codeSemigroupcode, then parameterizing on codeid  Acode. However, something odd is occurring in the record constructed for codeAbelianMonoidcode.p  precodelt Print Monoid.     Record Monoid A  Type op  A gt A gt A M  Semigroup op      id  A  Type  BuildMonoid      ididentleft  forall x  A, op id x  x       ididentright  forall x  A, op x id  x   lt Print AbelianMonoid.

I have seen exceptions that are trying to use resources that are initialized in my Service.onCreate, but these are null, and logging confirms that the main Service thread is in the onCreate.li liA request is handled by the Service during or after the Service.onDestroy.

Negative 4126 pWhile writing UI automation tests I come across forms with many fields and instead of passing numerous arguments to test methods I create classes to quickly set form data. So if there is a sign up form I create SignUpDataObjectClass which would have instance variable corresponding to form fields i.e. p  precodepublic class SignUpFormObject   private username  private password   public SignUpFormObject setUsernameString username    this.username  username   return this     public String getUsername    return username     public SignUpFormObject setPasswordString password    this.password  password   return this     public String getPassword    return password      Util method to set signup test data. Test method can use it on the fly  public static SignUpFormObject setSignUpData    SignUpFormObject dataObject  new SignUpFormObject   dataobject.setUsernametest user.setPasswordpassword    return dataobject           codepre  pAnd then I came across a scenario when it did not make sense to have single data object class for a form. The form is related to creation of Coupon and then there could be different categories of Coupon. For sake of brevity I would limit the number of fields here. So there would be two kinds of coupons  offer and printable. Both of them will have coupon name and one field specific to offer  lets consider it  offer expire date and another for printable lets consider it  printable code p  pSo I decided to create Coupon abstract class which would have all common fields and then CouponOffer and CouponPrintable classes would extend Coupon class and add their own fields i.e. p  precodepublic abstract class Coupon   private String couponname   public Coupon setCouponnameString couponName    this.couponname  couponname       public String getCouponname    return couponname   codepre  pAnd CouponOffer class comes here  p  precodepublic class CouponOffer extends Coupon   private String offerExpireDate   public CouponOffer setOfferExpireDateString offerExpireDate    this.offerExpireDate  offerExpireDate   return this       public String getOfferExpireDate    return offerExpireDate      Util method to set coupon offer data  public static CouponOffer setCouponOfferData     CouponOffer couponOffer  new CouponOffer       couponOffer.setCouponnametest coupon       couponOffer.setOfferExpireDate31122013      return couponOffer    codepre  pI am willing to know if using abstract class is bad approach here and there are better solutions available.  p

Using the codeltaltDeploymentRepositorygtcode option, the build team deploys the zip file to the QA repositorybr 4. Deploy the dependent ear and jar files to the QA repository 5. After the QA cycle completes, the build team runs a build to download the now tested jar and ear files, add preprod specific configuration templates, and packages the result into a zip filebr 6.

It doesnt seem to matter which one I use, but both are available if one or the other will make this process easier.  p  pI know nexus offers a build promotion feature in its pro version, but based on the documentation the key deal breaker is that the staged repositories have to be codeclosedcode before they can be used.  Our software has many different components and when fixing a bug in QA, we need to be able to redeploy only the changed components, and not the whole system.  The nexus staged repository setup doesnt seem to allow this.  If Im reading it wrong, somebody please point me in the right direction.p

Negative 4126 pI am using ASP .NET MVC 3 and I have an interesting problem to solve that I am hoping for some advice on.p  pI have a page that has a number of divs inside it.  The contents of each div changes over time and so currently I have a timer for each div running that makes a .ajax request to the server which returns a PartialViewResult with the updated contents of the div.  The partial view is quite complex and references other views.p  pThe problem with this approach is that it does not scale very well.  It could be that each user has a lot of these timers running and with a lot of users the server is constantly being hit.  I would rather, therefore, make a single request to the server that returns, potentially, multiple div contents so it would bep  precodediv1  some html  div2  some html  codepre  p...p  pThen on the client I could put each bit of HTML into the correct position on the page.p  pI thought that what I could do is return JSON from the server but my problem is  how do I get the HTML  At the moment the razor compiler will run and turn my partial view cshtml files into HTML but if I am returning JSON, is it possible to programmatically call the razor compilerp  pI found Razor Engine here a hrefhttprazorengine.codeplex.comhttprazorengine.codeplex.coma that seems to do what I want but is it possible to do it with just vanilla ASP NET MVCp  pOr, given the problem, is there a better way that I could achieve my goalp  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 4126 pI have a Script in my HTML document that detects when one of the arrow keys is detected then it changes the URL of an iframe. When the key is released the iframe is changed again. p  pThis works except during the time that the key is being held down it keeps repeating the action to set the iframes url. p  pIs there a way so when its held down it only changes the iframe url once Then when its released it changes the url back p  pstrongExtrastrong  Iv created a page to control a remote control car over the web. It works great except for this problem. Basicly it changes the iframe url to a PHP page with a diffrent get variable for each arrow key. The PHP page then uses PHP Serial to send data to the serial port based on what ever variable was sent from the iframe using GET. p  pThanks for any helpp  pEdit Heres a picture of the car. a

Negative 4126 pI was looking for advice on how to store data in a database for historical data mining purposes. If I can get the state of an entity at a given time, what is the best way to store it so that I can historically mine that data, predicting what the state is likely to be based on how it has been in the pastp  pFor a more concrete example, I can get the updown state of a server, and that servers current load. I can get this on a periodic schedule. Id like to store this data such that I could easily query for the updown state or the load for a specific timeframe, or get the entire history of that server. I dont have much experience, if any, in database design. p

It the past Ive randomly clicked, cleaned, built, etc. and eventually it showed up again with me not knowing what happened.  Today it seems restarting Xcode fixed it, but I dont know if that will always work.  Below are two screen shots, the first showing the wrong menu, and the second showing the correct menu.

Negative 4126 pI have a Spring MVC app that uses JSP to render pages. Spring has a builtin concept of Interceptors that go off before and after the controllers are invoked, but the postHandle call still happens before the actual rendering of the view.

Is there any builtin place I can put that without resorting to adding Tomcat interceptors I like my nice, contained Spring app.p

In C the GC of course takes care of deleting objects, but in C it has to be done explicitly using the codedeletecode keyword.p  pMy question is, is it ok to just follow each objects usage throughout a method and then delete it as soon as it goes out of scope ie method endreassignment p  pI know though that the GC waits for a certain size of garbage 1MB before deleting does it do this because there is an overhead when using deletep  pAs this is a game I am creating there will potentially be lots of objects being created and deleted every second, so would it be better to keep track of pointers that go out of scope, and once that size reachs 1MB to then delete the pointersp  pas a side note later when the game is optimised, objects will be loaded once at startup so there is not much to delete during gameplayp
Negative 4126 pApple released iOS 5.1 and the developer bits yesterday. One change is that the new stuff is Lion only. Currently OSX Lion isnt yet rolled out, and to have an exception, I must tell IT why. I think I have read you must submit with the latest SDK version.

I cant use XAML without MVVM, any app that is a bit bigger than hello world is easier to do with MVVM.p  h2Update after a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma993529475500answerah2  pAs I commented on the answer, I do like the design of WinRT, but the question remains unsolved until I know about the specific technologies mentioned above EF, WCFRIA  Validation, MVVM, SDKs and Toolkits. And obviously, Im not gonna start selling WinRT apps or digging into it until I have the above techs as a least.p  pConclusion, as one who most of his work is LOB apps, after checking around a bit, HTML5JS is far from being an alternative to SL. So for conclusion, I stick to SL and keep on recommending it to my customers. SL takes the least development time, and is bug free.

Negative 4126 pIm reading a book on OOP javascript and got stuck on one of the examples. p  pIn the first version of the sample code, a new instance of the codeShapecode constructor function is created and the codetoStringcode method is called. The codetoStringcode method returns Triangle which is the codenamecode property of the codeTrianglecode prototype, even though Shape is supposed to be the codenamecode property of the codeShapecode prototype. p  pIn the second version of the sample code, the codetoStringcode method returns Shape as intended. Im wondering how the changes in the second version of the code made any difference because it seems like in both versions of the sample code, the codeTrianglecode prototype holds a reference to the codeShapecode prototype so the codenamecode property of the codeShapecode prototype would still be updated to Triangle because of codeTriangle.prototype.name  Trianglecodep  pfirst version a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netxg9mS relnofollowjsfiddleap  psecond version a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netf6H8U relnofollowjsfiddleap

Negative 4126 pI have a parent process which creates 2 server sockets and calls codeselectcode on them to wait for new connection. When the connection arrives, a message is sent to a child process created with codeforkcode, after servers sockets creation, so they are shared.p  pIn this child, calling codeacceptcode on the server socket doesnt work. I got a codeEAGAINcode error nonblocking socket. Whereas calling codeacceptcode in the main process works perfectly.p  pOf course, I dont call codeacceptcode in the main process at all, I just tested to check if it worked, and it does.p  pWhy I cant call codeacceptcode in a child process after a codeselectcode in the parent p  pEDIT The goal here is to create a fixed number of workers lets say 8 to handle lcients connections, as in the prefork model. These connections will be longconnections, not like HTTP. The goal is to loadbalance connections between workers.p  pTo do this, I use a shared memory variable which contains for a worker the number of currently connected clients. I want to ask the worker with the lowest number of clients to handle a new connection.p  pThats why I do the select in the parent, and then send a message to a child process, because I want to choose which process will handle the new connection.p  pThe server listen on more than one sockets one for ssl, one without, thats why I use select and not directly accept in children processes, because I cant accept on multiple sockets in my children workers.p

I have a label tag for each radio button, and when selected clicked,  the backgroundcolor property of the label is changed to a highlighted colour using this JavaScript within each label tag codeOnClickthis.style.background5555ffcode p  pWhat I want to add to the above, is a JavaScript that will remove the above if the selection is changed within the group. E.g. A user selected radio button A in group 1, then changes their selection to radio button B in group 1. At the moment, both label backgrounds will be changed to the defined colour. p  pThe HTML form is created dynamically by PHP so radio button names, IDs, amp values will differ.p  pI have been unsuccessful trying to complete this task myself, and there doesnt seem to be a simple codeOnUnClickxxxcode either. I have searched on here for a solution but no questions match mine, although I have tried tweaking existing solutions to similar problems but to no avail.p  pThank you for readingp

Negative 4126 pWe have have a certain amount e.g. 300 units. This amount should be as evenly as possible distributed over 40 slots. It would be easy if each slot would be the same  so it would be 7,5 at each slot. However, the slots vary in size and we cannot fill in there more than its size allows for e.g. if its only 5. What we cannot fill in we have to distribute more over the other ones.p  pI have some basic ideas but I am far away from being an expeRt and hope there is an easy way to solve this. As an example how this could look like. In array a the values stand for the maxima the slots can take. a[i] is the maximum of the ith slot. b is what we have to distribute overall e.g. 300.p  precode  developing slots and their size  a lt rnorm40,10,4  suma    overall sum to distribute  b lt 300  codepre  pMaybe it is possible to sort the values in a increasing order and then one could use it by a double for loop. a[,2] becomes the column for the filled in amount.p  precode for i in 140  a[i,2] lt a[1,2]40  b lt a [1,2]40   for i in 240  a[i,2] lt a[1,2]39  b lt a[1,2]39  etc. codepre  pI am not sure how I can put the both for loops together and if this is an adequate solution overall.

ProfileSearch obviously depends on the Profile model, and Im quite certain that this will be AR.p  pSo the question is do I start specing out and building Profile and just start loading rails in my tests.  This seems like the easiest option but something about it seems wrong.  I feel like I would be desiging and building behaviour that my app hasnt specifically called for yet.  I would have to think about fields and relations and storage, etc.  All of which my app currently shouldnt care about.p  pOr should I use stubsmocks for all calls to Profile in my ProfileSearch spec and make sure the correct methods are being called.  This also seems wrong because Im not really testing the behaviour then, and the test would have to be rewritten when switching to SolrElastic even though the same behaviour would be expected.p  pOr maybe I should actually create a working Profile model that doesnt use AR for the time being but responds correctly to all the right methods as Uncle Bob demonstrated when building his wiki thing.  This seems like it might be the best approach theoretically but knowing I will be using AR in the future it also seems quite redundant. p  pOr... fck it and throw everything in the AR model p  pThere are so many patterns, principles, and best practices floating around in my head I dont know wtf to do.p  pWhat would you dop

Negative 4126 pCurrently, I have a website which serves dynamic PHPMySQL content from an Apache server, and serves static content JavaScript, images from a separate Lighthttpd server.p  pFor reasons of scale I would like to use Amazon Cloudfront and possibly S3. To be honest Im not entirely sure how S3 or CloudFront work. Im used to the normal server behaviour of upload a file... it becomes available and S3 buckets and CloudFront edgemirroring are daunting.p  pI need a better understanding of how this works and have some questionsp  p1 I dont want to store any images on my own servers. I want them to be entirely in the cloud. Am I correct that this means I will need to use S3 for storage as an origin server Will CloudFront on its own not be enough Is CloudFront just the edgeCDN servicep  p2 We currently upload images via a PHP script which FTPs them to our image server, or via manual FTP upload. How will that change if I use S3 I heard you cant FTP to it p  p3 If using S3, can I still create hierarchical directories and store images inside these The images are stored various folders deep and I cant afford to change the code, but I heard S3 was a flat bucketp  p4 Finally, I heard that with CloudFront, if a file changes, you have to issue an invalidation request, which costs money. Is this because CloudFront is caching the image from the origin Im not used to this as in my current setup I just replace an image via FTP and it updates Is there no way to imitate this classic behaviourp  pSincerest thanks for help.p

Negative 4126 pGood morning everyonep  pIm using the AvalonDock on a project, and I ended having a questionp  pIn some pages developed in my project, I have custom titles which use a standard textBlock. And in some pages, this specifically, I have a LayoutAnchorable anchored on the left side of the page, and a LayoutDocument anchored on the right side.p  pFor LayoutDocument, the title is empty, because I already have a title on this page.  This causes the TabItem Title of this LayoutDocument Tab still appears with empty value. As I would like to maintain my titles on all pages, I wonder if there is how I hide or remove this blank tabItem, which is the title. One of my attempts was modify the margin of the page, I got her stay up page. But this LayoutDocument TabItem is readjusted downward, keeping it visible.p  pI know this is not a problem AvalonDock, is a different behavior of the original design. The tab Title of the document was not meant to be hidden, but I think it would be interesting for those who want to have their own title pages. Best Regards.p  pGustavo.p

Negative 4126 pI read in a C introductory book that you shouldnt catch an exception if you dont know what to do with it.  Thinking of that bit of advice while programming in Java, I sometimes find I do not know what to do with an exception, but I am forced to catch it or percolate it up to avoid a compile error.  Id rather not clutter methods with codethrowscode clauses all the way up the call tree so I have often resorted to converting the exception to a codeRuntimeExceptioncode as in the following.  Adding codethrowscode clauses to many methods for an exception that isnt really handled properly dealt with seems verbose and distracting.  Is the following bad style and if so what is a better way to deal with thisp  precodetry    thread.join  catch InterruptedException e        Console.printwriter.formatsn, e.printStackTrace   throw new RuntimeException  codepre  pEdit Aside from the clutter, theres another problem with the percolating exceptions after code revisions you probably end up with some unnecessary codethrowscode clauses.  The only way I know to clean them out is by trial and error remove them and see if the compiler complains.   Obviously, this is annoying if you like to keep the code clean.p

Negative 4126 pI am dynamically adding rows to a table by cloning a row. One cell  has an input element.  When the row is cloned, the ID value for the input element is changed to be unique, however all inputs have the same class.  I have a click function assigned to the class assigned to the input element that opens a jQuery modal dialog.  The dialog has a textarea where the user enters a comment.br strongWhen the user clicks on Accept in the  dialog, I want the value of the dialogs textarea element to written to the value of the input element that was clicked.strongp  pThis only works when clicking on the first, original input element.  Adding rows and clicking on the input elements opens the dialog but the input element is not updated.p  pemOne strange behavor does occur...em After adding rows using the Add row button, if you change the  original rows input element, all the input elements are changed to that text.

Negative 4126 pI apologize for the naming of these fields, but Im have to block out things like field names based on an NDA.p  pSo basically I am in C and I am using Interop to communicate with an external library, which requires specific structures to be passed by reference, one of which uses a union.

Negative 4126 pFirst, a little bit about my set up I have a robotic arm into which points and movement patterns can be programmed into. The goal is to get it to move in certain ways based on the inputs that we put into it.p  pOn the same table as the robotic arm is another arm that moves under human power and can sense where it is in space. The two arms share a coordinate system already, but I am having trouble with a particular calcuation that is giving me a headache.p  pThe current goal is specifically to take three points with the sensing arm and then translate that into a halfellipse arc that travels through the three of them. This arc should start at the first point, reach apex at the second, and finish on the third, traveling through all three dimensions to do so if necessary. The three points feed through Visual Studio, then are put into MATLAB and turned into an array of 99 xyz coordinates.p  pWe have every step working except for the MATLAB function. The points are nowhere near the actual coordinates, though the relationship between them seems okay. Can anyone tell me what is wrong with the code p  pHere is what we have so farp  precodefunction P  getEllipticalPathh0,hl,hr define center of ellipse center  hlhr2  want everything centered at 0,0,0 h0  h0  center hl  hl  center hr  hr  center  xz plane direction between h0 and center d  [h01,0,0]49  now get the majorminor axis of the ellipse minor axisalong z axis a  h03 b  hr2arbitrary with hr  set increment of orbit incr  pi99  by symmetry, only need to compute first half of orbit allocation Pf  zeros99,3 for i199     ifi lt 50        newpt  [0, bcosiincr, asiniincr]  id     else          newpt  [0, bcosiincr, asiniincr]  99  id     end       Pfi,  [newpt1, newpt2, newpt3] end P  addOffsetPf,h0  end  simply adds a fixed translational offset to the given list of vectors n3 matrix.

Negative 4126 pI have tried setting up a logical way of using subversion or any other VCS really but ive played more with svn.p  pLet me start with explaining my problem, We are a few coworkers which needs to be changing our customers websites on a daily basis, however the customers also can change some files via their admin panel on the website. As well as some files are generated on the servers, logfile, exportimport data, sitemaps etc.p  pWe are now working over FTP, and to maintain some kind of file history we make .bak.revision.php files but it is emalmostem unmanagable. On top of that i am using Netbeans as my IDE, which requires local copies of the files.p  pTo start a project i need to sync changed files with my customer or worst case download full project which can take forever.p  pI really enjoy working with Netbeans, but now i sometimes end up using notepad instead.p  pI set up a pretty nice way of working with SVN with a postcommit hook that exports the project into a http folder that way i can do an update on my local copy, make changes and then commit done p  pBut i dont want to overwrite files that might have been changed on the server, for example the customers CSSfile which they can make changes to themselves.p  pSo i thought i cannot be the only one to have this problem, how to work with SVN if not everybody in the team does in my case the customersp  pi may be able to use svnignore on those files i guessp  pthis is test environment My post commit hook is very simple svn export filesvnrepoLIVE varwwwhtml forcep  hr  pEDIT Plausible solution i will look into, if i create a precommit, or even better preupdate hook to import overwrite files already in the repo, that would solve my problem, would it notp  pNVM The Import runs commit. commit and pre commit would not work well, since it would create an endless loopp  hr  pKindest Regards  Iesusp

Negative 4126 pIm working with the Google Maps API and feel there is a better way to search through the panorama images other then a massive codeswitchcode statement. I would think that using an external hash table would be far more efficient and much easier to maintain. Each image has a unique codepanoIDcode, which I would be able to define. Reading up on hash tables, I believe I am correct in saying I could make a table and perfect function to get the data I need in constant time. Is there a good resource on how to build this I am not experienced with hashing at all.p  pMy logic goes as this Each image is saved in a directory as codesometextpanoID.jpgcode, where codesometextcode is a string and codepanoIDcode is anything I want it to be. When initializing the data in the aforementioned switch statement, all the switching is done according to the panoID and the other metadata is accessed there. For examplep  precodeswitchpanoID      case test1       links.push         description  TEST2,         pano  test2,         heading  70              break     case test2       links.push         description  TEST1,         pano  test1,         heading  125              links.push         description  TEST3,         pano  test3,         heading  0              break       case test3       links.push         description  TEST2,         pano  test2,         heading  0              break    codepre  pSince I will know all the codepanoIDcodes, and will have no need to sort, add, or otherwise change anything once the table is built, I feel there is a way to make a perfect hash but dont really know where to start. Any tips Thanks a bunch in advancep

Negative 4126 pI am trying to create a distributed processing system on Android through Bluetooth, so I created a class that implements Serializable, made a method to serialize and deserialize that object so that I can send it as a ByteArray. The problem is that I need each object to have a different code to be run on the other devices. I thought of overriding a method, then running that method on the other device, but when I do so, I get a NotSerializableException. Is there any way to fix that Or if not, is there an alternative way to send different pieces of code to be executed on other devicesp

Negative 4126 pI am using codemysqldbcode for my database currently, and I need to integrate a messaging feature that is in realtime. The codechat democode that Tornado provides emdoes notem implement a database, whereas the codeblogcode emdoesem.p  pThis messaging service also will also double as an email in the future like how Facebooks message service works. The chat platform is also email. Regardless, I would like to make sure that my current, first chat version will be able to be expanded to function as email, and overall, I need to store messages in a database.p  pIs something like this as simple as for every chat message sent, query the database and display the message on the users screen. Or, is this method prone to suffer from high server load and poor optimization How exactly should I structure the infrastructure to make this workp  pI apologize for some of the inherent subjectivity in this question however, I prefer to measure twice, code once. p  pInput, examples, and resources appreciated. br Regards.p

Negative 4126 pRecently it came to our attention that our DB was using multiple timezones to record data, and or pass data around, and because of that data started going out of sync. So recently we made some changes to the data accepting that some of the time data will be misleading or corrupt in the sense that its not 100 accurate. well the old stuff at least That said, we have started making everything we can use GMT as times inout the problem is now trying to use offsets according to a user defined offset from a predefined list.p  pSo I can query accordingly and display it back to the user accordingly. Lets say I have a user from western america in the pacific time zone, that is an offset of 8, where as if I have someone in the eastern time zone thats a offset of 5p  pWith that dates in and out are currently based on the user preference, where as everything is stored in GMT on the DB so how is it I can pass codeNcode accordingly to something like codegmdatecode so I can query properly and display properly I hope this makes sense to someone.p

Negative 4126 pI am banging my head on the wall. It works, but it doesnt work.p  pLet me clarify, testing is on a LG Optimus G, A Galaxy S4, and a Lenovo Tablet all running 4.1p  pI am launching a server on each device, each device is broadcasting itself on a port, and when the user hits send, all devices that have had their service resolved, and their service has not been lost, a thread will loop launching other threads to connect to the servers broadcasting themselves, and send the data. The servers accept the incoming connection, hand it off to a thread, and then reopen themselves.p  pSo recap, every device has is broadcasting a server, every device is supposed to know and keep track of other servers, when data is sent all known servers get hit.p  pMy issue is that in 23 devices connections can consistently be established with the devices self.p  pEither phone, but only 1 of them at a time, seems to know about the other phone and is able to connect to the other phone. i.e. Galaxy S4 can say hi to Optimus G, but Optimus G cannot say hi except only to itself, or viceverse.p  pSo the discovering portion seems unreliable, and I do not know if it is me, Android, or the devices. I need outside eyes. I have tried to lay this out in a understandable and thought out manner, and I appreciate any help from any one who has knowledge on this issue as I am just making humble beginnings into the world of networks, and am more then willing to learn from someone.p  pI need a more reliable way of keeping track of services, or discovering them, as my implementation at least seems flawed.p  pI thank any help in advanced.

If the           value occurs at that position, return that position.           Otherwise, search recursively in either the first           half or the second half of the list.       int middle  loIndex  hiIndex  2       if value  A[middle]          return middle       else if value lt A[middle]          return binarySearchA, loIndex, middle  1, value       else    value must be gt A[middle]          return binarySearchA, middle  1, hiIndex, value        end binarySearch codepre

Negative 4126 pIm currently setting up a ckan and it was asked that before anyone could access the website, basic authentication was done. After that the user can check out the CKAN without a problem. However my problem resides in the fact that the basic authentication, before anything of CKAN is shown, somehow interferes with CKANs login system. If I, after I entered my BA credentials, want to log in it returns me a too many redirects. Ofcourse when I dont include basic authentication in my virtualhost, the login of ckan works without a problem.p  pSo my question is twosided, is there a way to let CKAN know that the basic authentication used isnt something he should be using and apparently see as a CKAN user.p  pOr is there a module in CKAN that allows for Basic Authentication to be asked before anything is shown on the website at all.p  pThanks in advancep

For examplep  pa, b,c,d, ep  ul lian item more left in the outer list does not depend on any ones further rightli liinner grouped items like b,c,d depend recursively on each otherli ulli ul  pThe modules must form an acyclic hierarchy, i.e. it is not possible that module A imports module B when B or one of the modules it imports already imports A. From this it follows that codeb, c, dcode from the example above must not be splitted across different modules.p  pNow I am somehow stuck and looking for a strategy to make sensible suggestions based on the information found so far. p  pOf course, one possibility would be to split according to the topologically sorted list of dependency groups. However, let us assume the list starts thusp  precodea, b, c, .... codepre  pWhere c depends on b and a, b on a and a on nothing. Here we could do the followingp  ul limodule ABC that defines a, b and cli limodule A that defines a, module BC that imports A and defines b and cli limodule C imports A and B and defines c, module B imports A and defines bli ul  pIf we simply map dependencies between functions into dependencies between modules we may end up with a module hierarchy that is too complex and fine grained.p  pSomehow I must take further factors into account. Maybe some desired module size, or number of imports.p  pAny advice, as well as pointers to existing software doing something like this are most welcome.p

Negative 4126 pIve been looking for hours on this I cant really come up with anything thats going to work. Hopefully I can gain some insight here.p  pHere is the problem guys. Im trying to come up with a better solution for sorting inventory. The particular items have bar codes on them so I figured it would be easy to hop in excel and plug away. The problem that Im running into is that I cant really figure out how to assign a lot or location number for a specific item and be able to reuse that if it comes up later. For examplep  precodeModel Input     Location st1000dm003     1 ST336706LC      2 st1000dm003     1 st1000dm004     3 ST336705LC      4 st1000dm003     1 codepre  pPreferably, the numbering would start at 1 and move up. The group of items in column A might not always be the same, so a table with the model number and the location will not work. It has to be able to tell if its seen that before and what number was assigned or assign a new one if it has not been seen. The other issue that Id most likely run into, is that Id like to be able to run this on Office Mobile for Office 365 on Android at some point. Any help is really appreciatedp

Negative 4126 pI am rewriting a MFC application that has a lot of problems. The main problem is it is unstable.p  pIt is a GUI application that communicates with an external module via USB. So it runs a communication stack every n milliseconds by using a timer. However system calls are not allowed inside timer callbacks so the program is unstable and crashes and hangs a lot because of this.p  pSo I have to rewrite the application to run the communication stack in a background thread. Another problem here is that the data is not completely separated from the presentation and if I use another thread I have to make sure I protect shared resources.p  pSo, mainly, the communication stack will notify the application that there is new data. This should be handled by the worker thread. It runs the communication stack, processes new messages and then locks the data struct while updating it and then it answers back to the module. It then sends a message with PostMessage to the Main thread to update the GUI.p  pBut the user can also tell the application to send data to the external module. This can be done in 3 ways 1. Send data once.  The MAIN thread would then send a message to the worker thread to take a message out of a queue and send it to the module. 2. Send data periodically. This would need to use a timer inside the worker thread or a flag might be enough and it would send data every loop in the thread update function. 3. Send a message to the module and wait for a response. This would require to use a timer to check for timeouts inside the worker thread. On reception of the message the worker thread has to notify the MAIN thread so it can update the GUI with the response.p  pSo Id need to 1. Run the communication stack in a separate thread. The comm stack is a state machine and calling it runs through it once checking for new data. There is no whileloop in it. You can also call a function in its API to send data.p  ol lipSend messages to the MAIN thread to update the GUI when things happen.pli lipSend messages to the worker thread to tell it to send data from the application.pli ol  pSo my questions are 1. MFC uses DocumentView model. I have a hard time figuring out the best way to match this with what I want to do or if I want to partly abandon that skip the document and have my own way of storing the data.   How do I best organize my data Have one big struct that contains all application data and then both the worker and main thread have to lock it when accessing it  When I send a message to the MAIN thread to update the GUI how do I best map the messages to the functions Using the MESSAGEMAP But the message maps are for the windows not the threads I need to be certain only the MAIN thread accesd the GUI. Id need to map each different change in the GUI to a certain function. Thats a lot of messages because there is not one uniform display in the GUI but a lot of different tabs message log, objects, custom messages. p  ol liHow does messages get processed Since the worker thread can access the stack both by running it normally and when the application tells it to send a message I have to finish one call to the stack before a different one is made. If the thread update always finishes what it does before it processes new messages, this is not a problem. Or could I potentially be inside the stack when the timer hits or I get a new message from the MAIN thread and it starts processing the stack as well Maybe I have to lock the stack not only for other threads but to make the sure the worker thread itself does not access it in 2 ways at the same time.li ol

For those who dont want to click the link to see said pesudo code, it looks like the followingp  precodecursor  1  apipath  httpsapi.twitter.com1.1endpoint.jsonscreennametargetUser  do       urlwithcursor  apipath  ampcursor  cursor            responsedictionary  performhttpgetrequestforurl urlwithcursor       cursor  responsedictionary[ nextcursor ]    while  cursor  0  codepre  pWith every request, the end user gets a cursor which allows them to navigate through pages of results. Each page holds 20, and if you have 200 followers you have to go through 10 pages. I have over 900 followers. I modified it to look like the followingp  precode includeconfig.php  db connection  includetwitteroauth.php oauth connection   followers    cursor  1 echo ltpregt    do       consumerKey  xxx     consumerSecret  xxx     OAuthToken  xxx     OAuthSecret  xxx      tweet  new TwitterOAuthconsumerKey, consumerSecret, OAuthToken, OAuthSecret      followers  tweetgtgetfollowerslist, arrayscreenname gt myscreenname, cursor gt cursor      printrfollowers      if issetfollowersgterror          echo followersgtnextcursorstr         break            foreachfollowersgtusers as users           followersQ  mysqlquerySELECT  FROM followers WHERE twid  .usersgtid. or diemysqlerror         numrows  mysqlnumrowsfollowersQ          if numrows  0              followersQ2  INSERT INTO followers                                          screenname, name, twid                                         VALUES                                         .usersgtscreenname., .usersgtname., .usersgtid.             followersR  mysqlqueryfollowersQ2 or diemysqlerror             echo done one setltbrgt                      cursor  followersgtnextcursorstr    while  cursor  0  echo ltpregt  gt codepre  pThe above code calls the twitter followerslist and gets the first 20 users. It then gets a cursor and goes to the next one, and repeats.

Can somebody point me in the right directionp  pThank you.p

Negative 4126 pThis is what I am trying to achievep  p1 When the user tries to login using his useridpassword, these credentials are validated against my database table to make sure the user is valid. 2 When the validation passes, I retrieve some of the details about the user and display those values in the JSF page immediately after logging in. p  pBoth these two process happen upon one single click ie while the user inputs his useridpassword and hits submit.p  pWhat I didp  pWhen the user hits submit upon logon, I use a query to check the values against a table in a bean called login managedbean name. When the values are present in the table, I use another query to retrieve the users  other information and populate these values in the setter methods in another bean called fields. Now, using faces redirect, I pass the name of the JSF page called userindex.xhtml. Now, I simply try to access the getter methods of the fields bean to display in the userindex page. p  pThe first two queries run successfully. The only problem seems to be that the fields bean object is initializedrecreated when I try to access its values from the userindex page. Please correct me if I am wrong.p  pTo summarize, I used a bean login to verify user input values with a backend table, accessed another bean called fields from the login bean to set all user related information and used these fields values to populate in the userindex page.p  pThe code snippets are given belowp  pstrongLogin pagestrongp  precode    lthform

Negative 4126 pIm working on an AIR app and Ive run itno one problem, hope some of you can help me.p  pSo, I have program filesMyAppconfig folder, and that folder by default contains only config.xml file.

When I try to install application again, installer sees that there already exsists program filesMyApp folder and makes a conclusion that the app is already installed, so it wont proceed.p  pIs there a way to somehow build install file that, when uninstalling, it removes emwholeem folder, no matter what there is inside of itp  pOne of the alternative solution was putting an logo image somewhere under the user documents folder. That would make uninstall, and reinstall possible even though the logo image will stay unremoved, but that solution doesnt work because app should look the same no matter which windows user runs it, thats requirement.

Then when the user comes to a thank you page, the table is updated and marked as transaction confirmed.  This works, but it seems messy.p  pThe problem is I end up with many useless database entries, it would seem alot of people get to stage three and dont go any further.  What I want is a table full of people that have paid and are verified.  So to counter this, I have created codetmpcode tables, where the data is stored, and then when the verification comes through, I move all the data over into coderealcode tables.p  pThis still seems highly convoluted to me and there must be a better solution.  One of the biggest pains is that final Pay By Card button in stage three, If it could do two things at once POST to my website and redirect the user to the card processing page  And I understand that this could be achieved with javascript but I still think thats a messy way to go about things, and a bit untrustworthy too.p  pSolutionsSuggestions please I am here to learn.p

Negative 4126 pI have 2 projects. First project need to include second. When I copy sources from second project to first I need to modify manually import path to R.java file. The problem is that I need to use SVN external link connection between this 2 projects, that is mean, one project the bigger one will take sources from another through svn and should be able to use it without any modifications.p  pIf I would be able to specify R.java file path anywhere in project properties  it will resolve my problem by changing manually that path. Need to specify that package name of these 2 projects are different.p  pAnother solution to resolve this problem also would be accepted. Thank you.p

Negative 4126 pHeres a simplified version of the code Im working with I have a python class with an instance method which takes in a list of strings and computes a result for each string, ultimately combining the results before returning, like sop  precodeclass Fooobject     def dotaskstringList         for s in stringList             result  computeResults          combine results below... codepre  pSince the computations with the strings are all independent and rather expensive, Im trying to parallelize the operation with the Pool class in the multiprocessing module. Ive thus defined a parallel version of codedotaskcode as follows Im currently just printing the separate results instead of combining themp  precodedef dotaskparallelstringList     numProcs  2     pool  PoolprocessesnumProcs     chunksize  intmath.ceillenstringList  floatnumProcs     for result in pool.imapself.dotask, stringList, chunksize         print result     pool.close codepre  pAccording to my understanding of how Pool works based on documentation and examples Ive read, this should split my stringList iterable into chunks roughly of size chunkSize, each of which is submitted as a task to one of the processes in the pool. Thus, if I have a list codestringList  [foo1, foo2, foo3, foo4]code split up amongst 2 processes giving a chunksize of 2, pool should divide this up into codestringList1  [foo1, foo2]code and codestringList2  [foo3, foo4]code, which will be handled by the two different processes in parallel. p  pHowever, when I create a Foo object and call codefoo.dotaskparallelstringListcode, it seems that pool is passing each element of my codestringListcode separately to codedotaskcode as a chunk of one. Not only does this not speed up my code, but it makes it incorrect and actually slows it down, as codedotaskcode then calls codecomputeResultcode on each character of the one input string passed in on each of the four separate calls. I was expecting two calls with each call handling an input list of size 2, not four calls handling a single input string. Ive checked and codechunksizecode is indeed 2. What am I doing wrong If it helps, Im running python 2.7.3 on Windows 7 through cygwin.p

Negative 4126 pI have an image placed within a relative width div as part of a responsive page design. The divs width and hence the images size is set to ensure that content beneath it appears above the fold on screens down to a certain resolution.p  pA minority of images that appear here have different dimensions e.g. 4x5 format vs. 4x6. These taller images push the content beneath it below the fold.p  pI want to maintain the divs height for the 4x6 dimension, which represents the majority of images, such that when an alt format image appears here, the top and bottom of the image are evenly clipped.p  pIve tried a couple different approaches, none with the desired effect. Applying a maxheight on the image element slightly distorts taller images. I tried maxheight on the wrapper div with overflowhidden, but that doesnt constrain the image element.p  pI applied maxheight to that mainImage div, too, and this emalmostem works. However, as you can see from the CSS, Im using backgroundcolor and padding to create a border around the image. Setting maxheight on the main div forces the bottom border of the image element outside of the main div. I also tried applying the border to mainImage, but the bottom border still does not appear. Lastly, with maxheight applied to the div and not the image, the image is not centered vertically within the div.p  pIm not sure how to accomplish what Im after, or whether its possible in a responsive design i.e. without a fixed height.

Negative 4126 pI am implementing a conventional that means emnotem fast, separated Fourier transform for images. I know that in floating point a sum over one period of sin or cos in equally spaced samples is emnotem perfectly zero, and that this is more a problem with the conventional transform than with the fast.p  pThe algorithm works with 2D double arrays and is correct. The inverse is done inside over a double sign flag and conditional check when using the asymmetric formula, not outside with conjugations. Results are nearly 100 like expected, so its a question about detailsp  pWhen I perform a forward transform, save logarithmed magnitude and angle to images, reload them, and do an inverse transform, I experience different types of rounding errors with different types of implemented formulasp  ol lipFu,v  Sumx0M1 Sumy0N1 fx,y  ei2piuxM  ei2pivyNp  pfx,y  1MN  like abovepli lipFu,v  1sqrtMN  like abovep  pfx,y  1sqrtMN  like abovepli ol  pSo the first one is the asymmetric transform pair, the second one the symmetric. With the asymmetric pair, the rounding errors are more in the bright spots of the image some pixel are rounded slightly outside value range e.g. 256. With the symmetric pair, the errors are more in the constant midrange area of the image emnoem exceeding of value range. In total, it seems that the symmetric pair produces a bit more rounding errors.p  pThen, it also depends of the input when image stored in [0,255] the rounding errors are other than when in [0,1].p  pSo my question how should an optimal, most accurate algorithm be implemented theoretically, no code asymmetricsymmetric pair value range of input in [0,255] or [0,1] How linearly upscaling result before saving logarithmed one to filep  pstrongEditstrongp  pmy algorithm simply computes the separated asymmetric or symmetric DFT formula. Factors are decomposed into real and imaginary part using Eulers identity, then expanded and sumed up separately as real and imaginary partp  precodesumre  fre  cosmodepi2.0vyN   mode  1 for forward, 1           fim  sinmodepi2.0vyN   for inverse transform  sumim permutated in the known way and  instead of  codepre  pThis value grouping indside cos and sin should give in my eyes the lowest rounding error compared to e.g. codecosmode2pivyNcode, because not multiplicatingdividing significantly false rounded transcedental pi several times, but only one time. Isnt itp  pThe scale factor code1MNcode or code1sqrtMNcode is applied separately after each separation emoutsideem of the innermost sum. Better inside Or combined completely at the end of both separationsp  pFor some deeper analysis, I have quitted the codeinputgttransformgtsavetofilegtreadfromfilegttransform1gtoutputcode workflow and chosen to compare directly in doubleprecision codeinputgttransformgttransform1gtoutputcode.p  pHere the results for an real life 704x528 8bit image delta  max absolute difference between real part of input and outputp  ul liwith input inside [0,1] and asymmetric formula delta  2.6609e13 corresponds to 6.785295e11 for [0,255] range.li liwith input insde [0,1] and symmetric formula delta  2.65232e13 corresponds to 6.763416e11 for [0,255] range.li liwith input inside [0,255] and asymmetric formula delta  6.74731e11.li liwith input inside [0,255] and symmetric formula delta  6.7871e11.li ul  pThese are no real significant differences, however, the full ranged input with the asymmetric transform performs best. I think the values may get worse with 16bit input.p  pBut in general I see, that my experienced issues are more because of scalingbeforesavingtofile or inverse rounding errors, than real transformation rounding errors.p  pHowever, I am curious what is the most used implementation of the Fourier transform the symmetric or asymmetric Which value range is in general used for the input [0,1] or [0,255] And usual shown spectra in log scale e.g. [0,MN] after asymmetric transform of [0,1] input is directly logscaled to [0,255] or before linearly scaled to [0,255MN]p

I would expect just the codelt5gt was greater than lt2gtcode, because thats the kind of message the other matchers return, e.g. codelessThancode used alone. p  pMy question being is this a bug or am I missing somethingp  pThe fact that different matchers return messages in different formats is a big deal, since I was trying to write some custom validation framework that uses the matchers and is able to return nice human readable messages if anything goes wrong. It seems that I cant use the codedescribeMismatchcode method for that purpose...p

Negative 4126 pWe had a problem that took us one week to solve. It was because a function ddot was declared in a fortran program in static .a archive as well as in a C program in .so dynamic library. The linker ld linked to the wrong entry.p  pIt turned out that the problem was solved when the fortran function was renamed from ddot to ddotsparse. But it took us one week to find that.p  pWould it be possible to do this kind of detection automatically As a matter of fact the linker accepted for the ddot from fortran and the ddot from the C library as legitimate. Could this be reported by the linkerp  pOr maybe it is a bug of ld that such things are not detected The man page of ld says Normally when a symbol is defined multiple times, the linker will report a fatal error. This clearly did not happen here.p  pAlternatively, are there tools to show up the tree of dependency between the various symbols of a binary executable That would be wonderfully useful. Something that shows for each symbol the used symbol and the file from which they originate.p

Negative 4126 pIm working on SQL 2012 Enterprise and I have a set of SSIS package exports which push data out to text files on a shared network folder. The packages arent complex and under most circumstances they work perfectly. The problem Im facing is that they do not work when scheduled  despite reporting that they have succeded.p  pLet me explain the scenariosbr 1 When run manually from within BIDS, they work correctly, txt files are created and populated with data.br 2 When deployed to the SSISDB and run from the Agent job they also work as expected  files are created and populate with data.br 3 When the Agent job is scheduled to run in the evening, the job runs and reports success. The files are created but the data is not populated.p  pIve checked the reports on the Integration Services Catalogs and compared the messages line by line from the OnInformation. Both runs reports that the Flat File Destination wrote xxxx rows. p  pThe data is there, the Agent account has the correct access. I cannot fathom why the job works when started manually, but behaves differently when scheduled.p  pHas anyone seen anything similar It feels like a very strange bug....p  pKind Regards,p  pJamesp

Negative 4126 pI need to store an array of items, where each item is 32 bits in length. So currently Im using an array of codelongcode. However Im compiling on another machine now where a codelongcode is 64 bits. This creates problems when it comes to signed numbers. i.e. printing the same number on both machines, one will be negative 32bit and the other will be positive 64bit. p  pSo the plan is to switch to codeint32tcode, the problem is that when using format strings to print the numbers out, the specifiers need to different as on the 32bit machine codeint32tcode is defined as a codelongcode and on the 64bit machine its defined as an codeintcode. p  pWhat is the best way to make sure that it will be 32bits on whatever machine its compiled on, and that the number can be printed It seems like this is a lot of hassle and that there should be a simplereasier way to have an array of items 32bits in length.p

Negative 4126 pIve created an app using jQuery Mobile 1.3.1 and PhoneGap 3.4, and have skinned it to have a fairly flat looking interfacep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSQ61D.png althome screenp  pIm having some trouble where, only on iOS, and only occasionally, the back button on only one certain screen becomes unresponsive. The same HTML amp CSS for the back button on other screens seems fine, its just this one screen. Here it is in chrome with the button selected in devtools to highlight its hit areap  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8vibN.png altback buttonp  pAnd just for good measure, heres the header as wellp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhXyEJ.png altheaderp  pThe code for this screens header is the same for just about every screen in the appp  precodeltdiv dataroleheader datathemee datapositionfixed datataptogglefalsegt     lth1gtEvent Detaillth1gt     lta datarelbackgtBackltagt ltdivgt codepre  pstrongWeve found that, should the user get stuck on this screen and forceclose the app, the button seems to work as expected in subsequent use.strongp  pSo my current theory is that the header is somehow getting in the way of the back button sometimes. The fact that its not every time makes me not really believe this theory completely, however.p  pThe button has its zindex set to 10 and the headers zindex is left at the default which is 1, correct. So even if it were the header getting in the way, my understanding is that the zindex of 10 should put the button on top and give it the first opportunity to receive the clicktap event.p  pThe app uses jQueryMobile 1.3.1 because of the timing of when and how it was created, and upgrading is not a reasonable option at this moment. There have been a significant number of breaking changes in 1.4.xp  pI have debugged the app on both iOS and Android and no JavaScript errors are thrown. Im at a total loss for what to do. This app is in the process of rolling out to thousands of users and theres a high likelihood that many, possibly most, will run into this bug. I would rather not have to explain with my tail between my legs that forceclosing is the only way to fix this... but thats what Ive been doing so far.p  pDoes anyone have any advice or ideas on how to fix thisp  hr  h3Update 1h3  pIve noticed while remotedebugging the app in Safari over USB that I can watch the classes on the back button change, when tapped, from codeuibtnupecode to codeuibtnhoverecode briefly to codeuibtndownecode and back to codeuibtnupecode  and yet the app is not going back p  pAnd as requested, here is the CSS applied to the header, the H1, and the back button just the computed final values, not all of the intermediary overridden valuesp  pstrongheader divstrongp  precodewebkitbackgroundclip borderbox webkitbackgroundorigin paddingbox webkitbackgroundsize auto backgroundattachment scroll backgroundclip borderbox backgroundcolor rgb179, 27, 27 backgroundimage none backgroundorigin paddingbox backgroundsize auto borderbottomcolor rgb179, 27, 27 borderbottomstyle solid borderbottomwidth 1px borderimageoutset 0px borderimagerepeat stretch borderimageslice 100 borderimagesource none borderimagewidth 1 borderleftcolor rgb179, 27, 27 borderleftstyle solid borderleftwidth 0px borderrightcolor rgb179, 27, 27 borderrightstyle solid borderrightwidth 0px bordertopcolor rgb179, 27, 27 bordertopstyle solid bordertopwidth 1px color rgb255, 255, 255 display block fontfamily MyriadPro, Helvetica, sansserif fontweight bold height 45px left 0px paddingtop 1px position fixed right 0px textshadow rgb85, 85, 85 0px 1px 0px top 1px width 320px zindex 1000 zoom 1 codepre  pstrongH1strongp  precodecolor rgb255, 255, 255 display block fontfamily MyriadPro, Helvetica, sansserif fontsize 18px fontweight bold height 23px marginbottom 10px marginleft 48px marginright 48px margintop 12px minheight 19.799999237060547px outlinecolor rgb255, 255, 255 outlinestyle none outlinewidth 0px overflowx hidden overflowy hidden paddingbottom 0px paddingleft 0px paddingright 0px paddingtop 0px textalign center textoverflow ellipsis textshadow rgb85, 85, 85 0px 1px 0px whitespace nowrap width 224px zoom 1 codepre  pstrongBack buttonstrongp  precodewebkitbackgroundclip borderbox webkitbackgroundorigin paddingbox webkitbackgroundsize auto webkitboxshadow none backgroundattachment scroll backgroundclip borderbox backgroundcolor rgb179, 27, 27 backgroundimage none backgroundorigin paddingbox backgroundsize auto borderbottomcolor rgb179, 27, 27 borderbottomleftradius 4px borderbottomrightradius 4px borderbottomstyle solid borderbottomwidth 0px borderimageoutset 0px borderimagerepeat stretch borderimageslice 100 borderimagesource none borderimagewidth 1 borderleftcolor rgb179, 27, 27 borderleftstyle solid borderleftwidth 0px borderrightcolor rgb179, 27, 27 borderrightstyle solid borderrightwidth 0px bordertopcolor rgb179, 27, 27 bordertopleftradius 4px bordertoprightradius 4px bordertopstyle solid bordertopwidth 0px boxshadow none color rgb255, 255, 255 cursor pointer display block fontfamily MyriadPro, Helvetica, sansserif fontweight bold height 31px left 5px marginbottom 0px marginleft 0px marginright 0px margintop 0px paddingbottom 0px paddingleft 0px paddingright 0px paddingtop 0px position absolute textalign center textdecoration none solid rgb255, 255, 255 textshadow rgb0, 0, 0 0px 1px 0px top 15px verticalalign middle width 60px zindex 10 zoom 1 codepre

Negative 4126 pSo im using the VideoJS HTML5 video playerp  pon my emin progressem video streaming website.p  pThe problem ive encountered is that the player has no problem playing links that end in the  .MP4 extension.

Negative 4126 pIm building a responsive Angular website a hrefhttpjacksoncmorgan.comnewSite relnofollowcan be viewed herea and have built a directive to handle my sites header.

Expanding the panel, then quickly clicking on the green square will cause the animation to fail.li liThe successful display of animations when resizing seems to be sporadic.li ul  pThis might have something to do with the way updates to the scope are applied in Angular directives, but I think it is probably something about CSS transitions as they are still somewhat experimental.

Negative 4126 pIm using Highcharts.js to render a bunch of charts to some divs that are jqueryUI draggables. In Chrome, this works perfectly fine. However, in Internet Explorer tested in 11, but maybe in other versions too, there are some scaling issues.

This is how it emshouldem look and how it does in Chromep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtnufB.png altenter image description herep  pEverything is nicely spaced, and I didnt have to set any spacing options.

My issue is the legend. In Chrome, I set no specific options for the legend and I was fine. Apparently that doesnt work for IE. I cant find any documentation or help on why this is happening. All of the items are present, and you can still click on them for normal behavior. They are all just stuck on one line like that.p  pHas anyone encountered this issue beforehave any ideas to fix it I tried a whole bunch of options for the legend in the chart settings, but other than being able to move it around while still stuck on one line I cant affect it.p  pcode sample HTMLp  precodeltdiv iddropwrapgt ltdiv iddockgt     ltdiv iddockheadgtAvailable Cardsltdivgt     ltdiv classdraggable iddrag1gt10 Year Historyltdivgt     ltdiv classdraggable iddrag2 styletop180pxgtPremiumltbrgtPie Chartltdivgt     ltdiv classdraggable iddrag3 styletop230pxgtLossltbrgtPie Chartltdivgt     ltdiv classdraggable iddrag4 styletop280pxgtPremiumltbrgtHistory Chartltdivgt     ltdiv classdraggable iddrag5 styletop330pxgtLossltbrgtHistory Chartltdivgt     ltdiv classdraggable iddrag6 styletop380pxgtLoss RatioltbrgtHistory Chartltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv idexpandgt     ltdiv idhlpmsg styletextweight bold fontsize 150 position absolute top 350px left 500pxgtDrag cards here to expand themltdivgt ltdivgt  ltdivgt codepre  pJSp  precodefunction areachartgenchtype, item  console.logitem drag4.highcharts     chart          type area,         backgroundColor 57CF57,         borderColor 000,         borderRadius 10px,         marginBottom 150,         marginLeft 70,         marginTop 40     ,     legend          floating true,         itemStyle              lineHeight 20px         ,         maxHeight 150,         labelFormatter function               return this.name         ,         layout vertical     ,     title          text 10 Year   chtype   History     ,     subtitle                  text Source lta hrefhttpthebulletin.metapress.comcontentc4120650912x74k7fulltext.pdfgt                      thebulletin.metapress.comltagt             ,     xAxis          allowDecimals false,         labels              formatter function                   return this.value  clean, unformatted number for year                           ,     yAxis          title              text chtype         ,         labels              formatter function                   if chtype  Loss Ratio                      return this.value                    else                      return   this.value  1000  k                              ,             labels                  overflow justify                           ,     tooltip          pointFormat series.name point.y,         valueDecimals 2     ,     plotOptions          area              pointStart 1940,             marker                  enabled false,                 symbol circle,                 radius 2,                 states                      hover                          enabled true                                                   ,             stacking normal              ,     colors [         6FF299, 5A90D6, E39220, D17BC6, 8085e9,         f15c80, e4d354, 8085e8, 8d4653, 91e8e1],     series [         name Casualty,         data [             [2004, 360902.0],             [2005, 371489.0],             [2006, 398748.0],             [2007, 416682.0],             [2008, 413205.0],             [2009, 374988.0],             [2010, 400701.0],             [2011, 483902.0],             [2012, 447391.0],             [2013, 456503.0]         ]     ,          name Engineering,         data [             [2004, 0.0],             [2005, 0.0],             [2006, 0.0],             [2007, 0.0],             [2008, 0.0],             [2009, 0.0],             [2010, 0.0],             [2011, 0.0],             [2012, 0.0],             [2013, 0.0]         ]     ,          name Ocean Marine,         data [             [2004, 0.0],             [2005, 180000.0],             [2006, 234395.0],             [2007, 248322.0],             [2008, 262216.0],             [2009, 248754.0],             [2010, 274888.0],             [2011, 289781.0],             [2012, 340459.0],             [2013, 405247.0]         ]     ,          name Property,         data [             [2004, 285354.0],             [2005, 365038.0],             [2006, 395420.0],             [2007, 554621.0],             [2008, 685197.0],             [2009, 630535.0],             [2010, 613608.0],             [2011, 643399.0],             [2012, 704345.32],             [2013, 822684.93]         ]     ]  item.resize codepre  pp  pHere is a link to the fiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netdLL8cw7s5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netdLL8cw7s5ap  pOddly, everything works perfectly fine in the fiddle, even in IE.

Negative 4126 pI was checking out the documentation of codePureAttributecode in a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.diagnostics.contracts.pureattributevvs.110.aspxMSDNa and I was surprised that it can be applied at class level.

Negative 4126 pI wrote a directory information utility and because I, and the people I wrote this for collect amp use vintage hardware, made it compatible with DOS and Windows 9x as well as Windows XPVista78 64bit because we also use those. The problem I ran into was with Windows 9x and FAT32 drives.  I managed to get it to work as long as Windows 9x was actually loaded, but if I boot to command prompt only, or restart in MSDOS mode I lose access to the Windows API that allowed me to get the large drive data and it defaulted back to the DOS routine I have.  These are limited to the 2GB limit routines.  Examining how the DOS 7.x programs chkdsk mainly, handle this as they have no problem reporting the correct drive sizes, it seems they use DOS interrupts primarily INT 21h, to do this.  Thinking, no problem, Ill do a quick version check, and if its DOS 7 or higher Ill just run a quick assembly routing to get the drive structure and calculate the total amp free space that way.  Only, the routine though it doesnt return an error, doesnt fill my buffer with anything.p  pHere is the codep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltdos.hgt  void mainvoid      unsigned short hes,hdi,sectors,bytes     unsigned long tclusters,fclusters     unsigned char far drivedata     char test  0     char display[17]  0123456789ABCDEF     int count      drivedata  new unsigned char [63]      for count  0 count lt 63 count drivedata[count]  0      drivedata[0]  x3d     drivedata[1]  x00      hes  FPSEGdrivedata     hdi  FPOFFdrivedata  asm          push ax         push es         push di         push ds         push dx         push cx         mov ax,0x440d         mov bx,0x0003         mov cx,0x484a         int 21h         jnc GOOD         mov ax,0x7302         mov es,[hes]         mov di,[hdi]         mov dx,0x0003         mov cx,0x003f         int 21h         jnc GOOD          test  1 GOOD     asm          mov ax,0x440d         mov bl,0x03         mov cx,0x486a         int 21h         pop cx         pop dx         pop ds         pop di         pop es         pop ax           if test  1          printfThere was an error.rn         return             tclusters  unsigned long drivedata[48]     tclusters  tclusters  256  unsigned longdrivedata[47]     tclusters  tclusters  256  unsigned longdrivedata[46]     tclusters  tclusters  256  unsigned longdrivedata[45]     tclusters      fclusters  unsigned longdrivedata[36]     fclusters  fclusters  256  unsigned longdrivedata[35]     fclusters  fclusters  256  unsigned longdrivedata[34]     fclusters  fclusters  257  unsigned longdrivedata[33]      bytes  unsigned intdrivedata[5]     bytes  bytes  256  unsigned intdrivedata[4]      sectors  unsigned longdrivedata[6]     sectors      printfDrive C hasrn     printf   Total Clusters urn,tclusters     printf    Free Clusters urn,fclusters     printf          Sectors urn,sectors     printf            Bytes urn,bytes      printfrn     printf     0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   A   B   C   D   E   Frn     printf     for count  0 count lt 63 count          if count  16  0 printfrn c  ,display[count  16]         printf03u ,drivedata[count]          printfrn      return  codepre  pThat last bit was me trying to figure out what was going wrong.  I was getting strange results, and couldnt figure out a pattern.  Originally, I wasnt worried about clearing the buffer as the INT call should have been filling it with its own values except the first 2 bytes, which is supposed to be filled with the EDB data buffer size. After getting so many apparently random results, I added in the loop at the beginning to fill the buffer with zeroes, then add in the buffer size.  The results stopped being random at that point, they were invariably all zeroes, meaning the INT call isnt filling the buffer.  With a variety of tests, Ive confirmed that hes amp hdi are correctly being assigned the segment and offset of the buffer address.  Ive also tried es amp di to the pointer address instead of the buffer address.  I didnt think it would work as everything I read said to set it to the address and not to a pointer, but I was trying everything I could think of.  In all cases, the buffer isnt getting filled with anything.p  pAs you can probably tell, this is just a test program Im writing to figure out the exact procedure before adding it to my main program which works just fine except for this one issue.  The FP lines are just macros that could be stated as unsigned longx amp 0xffff0000  16 for the segment and unsigned longx amp 0x0000ffff for the offset.  Normally you would pass the pointer ampdrivedata, but drivedata is already a pointer.p  pThe actual outputp  precodeDrive C has    Total Clusters 1     Free Clusters 0           Sectors 1             Bytes 0       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   A   B   C   D   E   F   0  061 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000   1  000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000   2  000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000   3  000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000  codepre  pSo, what am I missing  Like chkdsk, Im locking the drive before and unlocking it after the call though Im not sure of the necessity.  How can I get this to work right  Alternately, is there a better way of getting the drive structure clusters, sectors per cluster, bytes per sector, than using INT 21h  Everything I find in searches only point me to Windows API functions, which the user wont have access to, if they do a boot to command prompt etc...p

Negative 4126 pObjective Vectorize tokenized text to create term document matrix that enables NLP analysis on unstructured text data. Prediction and text classification will be a big part of the analysis, so being able to associate a labelclass with each text is crucial. To this end, I need the term document matrix to be structured such that each row represents one text and each column represents one of the words that appears in the entire corpus. The texts classlabel will also be a vector in the matrix.p  pProblem Each record in the text is represented as an item in a list the first record is the first item in the list, the second record is the second item in the list, and so on. Tokenizing the contents of every record in the list and generating a huge list of every word is easy. My problem is that after tokenization Im unable to retain the original list structure and map each of the tokens with their record from the original list. This renders vectorization impossible.p  pTo illustrate p  precoderecordone  I like ham. I also like pineapple. recordtwo  I love cheese. I enjoy tomato sauce and dough too. recordthree  Hence, I dig Hawaiian pizza. And beer. recordList  [recordone, recordtwo, recordthree] codepre  pResults three records in list, each with two sentencesp  precode[I like ham. I also like pineapple., I love cheese.

Vectorizing at this point gives me a 28x18 matrix, when what I need is a 3x18 matrix. I need to somehow map each term to its record in recordList to give me the 3x18 matrix, but Im not sure how to do that. I know theres something obvious Im missing.p  pIm new to Python and NLP, so Im trying to keep things as simple as possible. This means using lists, creating loops to work over those lists, and list comprehensions. I know there are other modules and functions that can do this scikit, but Im trying to force myself to use fundamental Python data structures to improve my understanding of the language. If its possible to create a solution using a basic Python data structure that would be awesome. p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 4126 pIm not sure about the source, but my current knowledge is that the local variables of a CC function are initialized at the entry to the function.

I am asking about how the machine deals with code, not for humans.p  pedit To clarify my question, if all the local variables of a function are initialized at the entry to the function, than declaring variables in the middle of the function body will have no other benefits than better readability.

Negative 4126 pIm working for an image processing project. Im using SURF algorithm and i have already read SURF official paper. I know that the dimension of the image doesnt change in the scalespace like in SIFT. Now, for example, if i use 3 octave and 2 levels for each octave, i will use these dimension of box filters 9x9, 15x15 first octave, 15x15,27x27 second octave, 27x27,51x51 third octave. My question is is the convolution between integral image and the box filter 15x15 of the first octave equal to the convolution between integral image and the box filter 15x15 of the second octave In my opinion the results are equal, but, maybe there are two differents variance values of box filters in the convolutions explained above. I didnt understand this part of the paper.p

Negative 4126 pI have three environments dev, test and stagingprod. In our previous model of using Team Foundation Server, we would have three branches of code that matched up to each of these three environments. p  pDevelopers would work locally and when they had their code complete, theyd check it into the dev branch.  When checking in, TFS automatically creates something called a changeset.  This checkin would kick off a build of the files into code which then gets deployed to the dev environment.p  pWhen a developer was happy with their code in dev, theyd merge just their changeset into the test branch.  Theyd pull up a complete list of all of the available changesets that dhad not been merged into test, theyd select theirs and check those into the test branch. Again, this would kick off a build and the output files would get deployed to test.p  pOnce QA was happy with the changes, the dev would merge this changeset into the prod branch. Kicking off a build and the files would be deployed to the staging area. The developer and QA would them promote these files to prod.p  pAll of would allow multiple developers to work on the same files using this changeset mentality.  When a specific changeset or set of changesets was merged into another environment, only those changes would get merged.p  pIn my relatively new exposure to git, I cannot seem to find a way to select specific pull requests which I assume is similar to a TFS changeset from one branch to another branch. When I try to make a pull request from one branch to another branch, it wants to pull in not only my pull request, but every other pull request made in the lower branch by other developers too.  What is the magic way to make this happenp  pstrongemNotestrong Unfortunately we dont have the notion of a release. We have five scrum teams working on one website with over 200 pages. Each scrum team has their own sprints and can release multiple scrum stories during their sprint.  We have internally only one DEV environment, and one TEST environment and one PROD environment.  Not only are our environments used by these five scrum teams, but these DEVTESTPROD sites are is also used by various other teams for integration efforts with applications we sell and also for customer account management and purchasing.  We cannot change that infrastructure.emp  pstrongemNotestrong this is not for a discussion as to if this changeset methodology is correct or proper. This is a question of how to achieve this behavior in githubgit.emp  pstrongemNotestrong we are a set of scrumbased agile teams. We work from stories. As many as 60 stories can be actively in development at any one time with our large team of 25 developers. When one story is ready for prod, we promote it to the prod environment as an atomic unit. So think of a changeset as a story.emp

Negative 4126 pI have a development setup where I need multiple containers running different services, and Im trying to use a hrefhttpfig.sh relnofollowFiga to achieve this. Everything else works fine, but one of these services is a Play Framework app, and it does not want to stay running unless it gets a pseudoTTY. This would be fine and good, but since I want to coordinate these multiple containers, I want to codefig upcode, and that command does not seem to allocate pseudoTTYs, so the process dies immediately after startup, and all the containers along with it.p  pIve created a hrefhttpsgithub.comilkkadockerplaytest relnofollowa repository with a showcase of this problema that anybody can just clone and run, the instructions are in the README. If anybody can shed any light on how to create e.g. a middleman script that would keep the app running, or really any other solution where I could codefig upcode my linked container setup, thatd be brilliant.p  pAlternatively, if anybody is using any other methods of coordinating multiple containers like this, like maybe a nice shell script runner that manages things, I welcome your insight.p  pstrongeditstrong I changed the accepted answer because the new one actually solves the problem. The workaround answer still has valuable info, though.p

Negative 4126 pI have touch id functionality in my application. I have created a option in settings bundle to enable and disable the touch id. The problem is i am able to see the touch id settings in the device s which does not support touch idiPhone 5, iPhone 4s . How can i handle this Please help.p
Negative 4126 pI have a table with columns codeid, itemscodep  precode ID    Items   1      mc3  2      mc2  3      mc1 codepre  pI want to insert this data into a temp table but the order of items in descending i.ep  precode ID     Items    1     mc1   2     mc2   3     mc3 codepre  pbut I cant take order by of these items. codeitemscode column has duplicate values. I tried to use identity column but that was a terrible idea.

Negative 4126 pSo, I am a novice javascript coder just barely getting my feet wet. I am building a small app that produces a randomly generated sports team name by adding one value each from a set of two arrays, a noun array and an adjective array, at the click of a button. To this moment I can generate one team name, but then instead of replacing the old team name when clicking again, the old name remains and I have to refresh the page for the button to be able to load a new team name. pIve kind of felt like the answers a lot more simple than I think but Im at the point where Ive realized its finals week and I cant spend all my time on this.

Negative 4126 pDisclaimer Im a PHP developer and am somewhat new to Rails. p  pI am working on an application which requires me to create blocks of content. There are different types of blocks but they do share common elements Title, Location. The issue Im having a hard time wrapping my brain around is the fact that each block could have its content defined in a different way. p  pFor example p  pContent Block content  This block stores html entered in by a user, so it would get its data pulled from a database. p  pCalendar Block calendar  This block displays a listing of events, so it would need to render a viewp  pIntegration Block integration  This block is an example of a third party integration block. It may get its data by parsing a json feed and rendering it in a particular way. p  pSo my thought was maybe to create each of these block types as a module or plugin that registers a block type and provides info as to how and where to get that data. Similar to how Drupals hook system works. Im struggling to figure out a smart way to architect this. There could, in theory be an unlimited amount of block types and I want to make sure I can keep this code base modular and organized. p  pAny insight is greatly appreciated.  p

Negative 4126 pI come from a Java background, where everything is Object Oriented.  While Getting into a bit more of Javascript more into the class areas of javascript, Ive noticed complete changes.

Negative 4126 pIm looking to do some integration testing on my ASP.NET MVC 5 application much like I am able to do with Javas Spring framework with MockMvc. What I mean by this is that I would like to be able to send HTTPlike requests to my controllers without the need to instantiate the controllers manually in my tests. p  pstrongDoes anything like Java Spring MockMvc exist for ASP.NET MVC 5strongp  pIve already looked briefly into codeFakeHostcode and codeXania.AspNet.Simulatorcode. p  pFakeHost seems to be close to what I would like to achieve, but I am unable to get it to run with MVC 5. When I send my requests, I get a response like this from my MVC 5 appp  blockquote   pThis operation requires IIS integrated pipeline mode.p blockquote  pWhich Ive concluded is due to the fact that MVC 5 apps require IIS Express in integrated mode to work and that is not happening when I send the request from FakeHost. p  pWith codeXania.AspNet.Simulatorcode again I must instantiate the controllers and call their methods, so to me this is more like unit testing with mocked services and not integration testing.p  pThoughts p

Negative 4126 pSo Im quite new to Git and DVCS in general, and Ive been reading everywhere that, at least on private branches, it is always good to commit all the time. The question is why I am using SourceTree Git client with graphical interface and I find it much easier to stage and then commit my code once everything is working and Im done, since I can still see my diffs in SourceTree before committing.p  pSo whats the reason for committing more often And how often should I do itp

Negative 4126 pIve examined the output of MediaExtractor on two Android devices, and it appears to produce slightly different samples on them, given the same  video file.p  pWith one device, nonVCL NAL units are concatenated onto the next VCL unit to produce a sample. On the other device, each nonVCL unit constitutes a complete sample.p  pAnother difference On one device the samples have the leading 0 byte and start code prefix 001 in the sample on the other, those bytes are omitted.p  pIf I try to use the format of NAL units for the first device on the other device, the video does not play.p  pIf Im producing my own NAL units not using MediaExtractor, is there a principled way to know what format the MediaCodec H264 decoder is expectingp

Negative 4126 pI have a bug in a Windows Forms app that I have to fix.  There is a groupbox that contains some controls a few labels, some DevXPress SpinEdits, and some checkboxes.  The groupbox is disabled when the form is instantiated, which causes the controls inside to be disabled.  In certain cases, the user can press a toolbar button to enable those controls.  What I am seeing is that when I enable the groupbox, the controls inside dont reenable.  If I loop through and enable them manually, the labels and checkboxes work, but the SpinEdits dont.  The updown buttons work, but the text entry area is stubbornly disabled or readonly or something.  Inspecting the SpinEdit shows that everything emshouldem be fine for editing.p  pIs there any way to check to see if there is some container control thats keeping these controls disabledp

However, since codebasecode and codechildcode are template functions, they are located in a header file which is included with every translation unit that uses these classes. That means the compiler should know everything it needs in order to support inlining to my knowledge, since it does not need separate compilation. Ive tried this out, and basically the function isnt inlined, and it doesnt lead to any real performance benefit in addition to function call overhead, I think pipelining gets ruined too. Is there a way to support inlining for this situation Or is there any advice to implement this kind of thingp

Wich you usually get when using the commands from the menu Debug  Export DataTips...p  pSo far i got hold of the dte object and cought the relevant informations of those Eventsp  precode Name  Debug.ExportDataTips  ID  800  Guid  5289D302243247618C45051C64BD00C4  Name  Debug.ImportDataTips  ID  801  Guid  5289D302243247618C45051C64BD00C4 codepre  pIm using then following code to trigger saving  loadingp  precode  dte.ExecuteCommandDebug.ImportDataTips   dte.ExecuteCommandDebug.ExportDataTips codepre  pbut as you can imagin, it will pop up with a File Dialoge.p  pA more preferable method would be to use custom load  save methods wich dont require user input at all.p  pIn order to accomplish this i would need a way to get hold of all DataTips inside a project, and a way to add DataTips to a project via code.p  pMy Main Question is Is this possible and if yes howp  pAnother way i could think of is, to grab the dialog window in a seperate thread since the command seems to be blocking and manipulate the storage path to my desired location and send a message to push the SaveButton on that Dialog Window. But i dont feel this is the right way to go.p  pAny idea or input is appreciated.p

Negative 4126 pIn our office we have a Ubuntu Linux 14.04 server on which we develop our PHP websites.

Ive tried to set up netatalkafp for the Macs but thats a different question.p  pVarious colleagues on the Win and OS X machines have reported intermittent problems either copying files to certain folders, or with saving PSD files when working in Photoshop. On some occasions, when the file saving errors occurs the files are actually DELETED from the share. p  pI myself get the occasional popup in Coda telling me I cant save a file, even when Ive worked on and saved it repeatedly in the time leading up to the error.p  pIve checked all the permissions and as far as I can work out, they are correct. We had a Linux server a few years ago and I dont remember having these problems. I know Adobe dont recommend working on PSDs over a network share but we never had this problem when using a Mac as our PHP dev host  and this problem extends beyond just Photoshop.p  pAny suggestions would be appreciated.p
Negative 4126 pI have a list of items fetched from a collection and I want to make it show different stuff depending what button is clicked.

Negative 4126 pI am aware that there is a popular notion that implementation details do not warrant testing andor that the implementation should just be made public. For the sake of this question, please assume that there is merit to both testing and to minimising the API.p  pHow should one go about testing an internal free functionp  precode Example for C static MyType dosomethinginternalOtherType  X  Or roughly equivalently namespace  MyType dosomethinginternalOtherType  X  codepre  pThe option we currently take is to expose the call, but in a detail namespacep  precode Preserve the friendly function name and internal linkage static MyType dosomethinginternalOtherType  X extern MyType detaildosomethinginternalOtherType X    return dosomethinginternalOtherType X    C version preserving the external linkage of the original namespace detail MyType dosomethinginternalOtherType  X codepre  pWe could instead expose a single object containing references to the internal functionsp  precodestruct exposedfortest    auto detaildosomethinginternal  dosomethinginternal   auto detailother  other   Similar in C, but somewhat less convenient to write out codepre  pWe could wrap the testing interface in preprocessor macros with varying degrees of carep  precodeifndef TESTINGBUILD define LINKAGE extern else define LINKAGE static endif LINKAGE MyType dosomethinginternalOtherType  X  or ifdef TESTINGBUILD static MyType dosomethinginternalOtherType  X extern MyType detaildosomethinginternalOtherType  X  return MyType dosomethinginternalOtherType  X  endif codepre  pAt present I am leaning towards the last option. Any nontest code that calls the exposed interface will fail to link in the release build. However, this seems to unavoidably double compile time, and it feels a little uncomfortable to test different object files to those released. Perhaps it would be better to leave the testing interface in place and rely on link time optimisation to strip it out. p  pI am also considering writing the test code inline with the release code to access static functions directly. This clutters up the real code with test code though, and is probably a contentious solution. p  pAll of the above options seem pretty crude however, so Id like to ask the community   do you have any better ideas, or do you favour one of the above Thank you.p

Negative 4126 pI am trying to create my first Android app. I would like a mainthread Activity in my case an ActionBarActivity to receive notification of an event from a background Activity in my case an IntentService. Ive read that using broadcasts should be the best way to do this.p  pTo register a Broadcast Receiver for listening to broadcasts sent from the background activity, I am using the following code inside the mainthread activityp  precode Register broadcast receiver LocalBroadcastManager bManager  LocalBroadcastManager.getInstancethis IntentFilter intentFilter  new IntentFilter intentFilter.addActioncom.me.myBroadcast bManager.registerReceiverbReceiver, intentFilter codepre  pI tried putting this in the onCreate method of my mainthread activity, but I quickly discovered that every time I restart the activity e.g. closing the app and reopening it, it seems to create duplicate broadcast receivers, which then trigger the Broadcast Receivers onReceive method multiple times whenever a single broadcast is sent. This is causing problems.p  pSo I created a SharedPreferences file to save a boolean which remembers whether or not I have already created a Broadcast Receiver, so as to avoid creating duplicates. This works exactly as hoped, until I restart the device of course, after which the Broadcast Receiver is destroyed, and the app doesnt create a new one because the SharedPreferences boolean says it already has one.p  pIm guessing I could patch this issue by setting up a new broadcast receiver to listen for a device reboot, which resets the SharedPreferences boolean, but I have this nagging feeling that I am overcomplicating things massively. What am I missing Thanks for any help offeredp

Negative 4126 pIt seems that a standard has been built around theming in Polymer 1.0. For example, all paper elements use CSS variables such as codedefaultprimarycolorcode and codeprimarybackgroundcolorcode.

Is there any reference out therep
Negative 4126 pI have no base code or example to start from on this.... Just tossing the idea around in my head. p  pSo I would have something like a slider.... at a 30 degree angle and need a bar or object to move along that path to a certain percentage or value along that. p  pFrom my limited knowledge I think Id need to use interpolator....  But where would I even start with thisp  pMy target would be to give the method a value, say between 1 and 100.  And then the object or bar would be animated to that position on the path.  Like a bargraph, but used as a gauge.p
Negative 4126 pSo, I am running into a bit of a snag with my code and Im not sure why, or how to get around it. I am writing a method that will take a list of objects and filter it based around some rules. After applying all of the rules, if the list is still over a certain size I need to randomly select items from a specific sublist then and discard the rest. The problem I am running into comes from this block of codep  precodeListltGroupgt filteredList  groupList.subList0, firstMatch  iffilteredList.size lt MAXNUMRETURNED     This sub list is where I need to pull random items from     ListltGroupgt subList  new ArrayListltGroupgt     subList  groupList.subListfirstMatch, lastMatch       Random rand  new Random      whilefilteredList.size lt MAXNUMRETURNED         int randPos  rand.nextIntsubList .size         remove a random group from the sublist and add it to the filtered list         filteredList.addsubList.removerandPos             codepre  pThe codefilteredListcode starts with 0  n groups, and if its size is less than the maximum random groups from a subset are added until it hits that number.p  pThe problem is that when the codefilteredList.addsubList.removerandPoscode line is called I get a codeConcurrentModificationExceptioncode error and the program halts. p  pIve looked up what causes this error but all the examples Ive seen dont seem to apply to this case. I am not iterating over either list, I am just running the loop based on the size of one of them. Most of what Ive seen suggested to fix the codeConcurrentModificationExceptioncode has been to create an Iterator and use coderemovecode but that only removes the next item in the iterator, and I need to remove a random item each time.p  pMy question is, is there some obvious change I need to make to avoid the concurrency issue, or is this whole methodology fundamentally flawed p  pP.S. There may be some inefficient code or some edge cases that havent been handled yet. I am doing TDD and havent gotten to all of the test cases yet. The current test this is breaking for is when codefilteredListcode has a size of 0, and the codesubListcode contains every group in the original codegroupList.code Once this test stops breaking Ill refactor and work on other test cases.p

Negative 4126 pI am having an issue with comparing two arrays. One is a fixed data set while the other is being generated dynamically. p  pA sample of the two arrays are as followsp  precode Fixed list of 197 countries scope.countries  [   name Afghanistan, code AF,   name Albania, code AF,   name Algeria, code AF,    ...    name Zimbabwe, code ZW ]  Dynamically generated list of matched countries  scope.matches  [   name Belgium,   name Ghana ] codepre  pAt the end of the game a function will be run and a comparison of the two arrays will be made. As of right now I have tried What seems like almost every combination of this compare using angular.forEach and standard javascript loops. The issue comes when I try to log what countries havent been matched. p  pThis is the compare function I am running.p  precodescope.compareArrays  function       angular.forEachscope.countries, functioncountry,name         angular.forEachscope.matches, functionmatch           if country.name  match.name              console.logcountry.name            else              console.logMATCHED                             codepre  pThe function will find and log the countries that havent been matched...but it is logging the entire list of unmatched countries multiple times. Specifically once for every object in the matches array. p  pSo for example if the matches array is the same as the sample above, it will log the unmatched countries list twice once with Belgium logging as MATCHED and the other time logging Belgium as an unmatched country Same for Ghana but reversed obviously. p  pI simply want it to log a list of the unmatched countries once and that is all. p  pIm hoping it is a simple oversight but cannot figure it out. Thank you in advance.p
Negative 4126 pI have quite a simple problem. I am rewriting very old app which is using direct access to database through DAO objects. There is no business layer the code is not mine and is quite anticode, so connection.setAutoCommitfalse is used for starting the transactions everywhere in the code. I had to rewrite the project because of security reasons, so it does not use database connection but webservices and hibernatejpa on the J2EE server side before it was standalone app, now appj2ee. Simple  I just moved the DAOVO objects to the webservice server and rewrote sql to hql and DAO in client replaced with webservice client.p  pBut what to do with transaction code Normally one transaction one webservice call. So I need some mechanism parameter in webservices that could help me to reference to the same hibernate transaction across multiple webservice calls. Is it completely bad approach and should I just move the transactions in server codep

The content is loaded with the same MoPub function. Now there is no crash, but the ad cell shows up completely blank with no content. Even if I manually set codemainTextLabel.text  Please show upcode nothing will show up.p  pThe crash when I try to load the IBOutlets makes me think something is wrong with the way Im linking up the NativeAdCell to the tableView, but it seems like the MoPub SDK should handle this. p  pCan anybody spot the problem based on this infop

Negative 4126 pI recently started learning C, coming primarily from Java. I know the basics now, and I want to test out some graphics.

Heres my code it logs Could not initialize GLFW to the consolep  precodeinclude ltGLFWglfw3.hgt include ltiostreamgt  int main      if glfwInit          stdcout ltlt Could not initialize GLFW ltlt stdendl          else          stdcout ltlt GLFW initialized ltlt stdendl         glfwTerminate           stdcin.get     return 0  codepre  pIve seen lots of similar test code before, so Im assuming that the code is the issue. Im also not getting any linking errors, so I think I did that properly. However, this is essentially the first time Ive used a third party library with C, so I could be making a simple mistake.p  pIm using Visual Studio Community 2015, but since GLFW doesnt have any prebuilt binaries for that yet, I had to build them myself with CMake. Since Ive never done that before, I repeated this whole process in Visual Studio Community 2013 with the prebuilt binaries, and I got the same result. I added my lib and include folders in the appropriate places in Configuration Properties  VC Directories, and I added the glfw3.lib and opengl32.lib files in Linker  Input  Additional Dependencies.p  pIve found an abundance of posts where people have linking errors which I dont have anymore or cant get GLFW working even when initialization succeeds. However, I havent been able to find anyone else with a problem quite like mine, nor do I know where to start in terms of debugging. Any help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 4126 pstrongIntroductionstrongp  pIm working on an application using an entity component system.  The system relies heavily on two abstract classes, Component and Processor, which share a one to one relationship.  Each Processor implements a basic Subscriber interface allowing the EventManager class to notify them when a new Event is created.p  pstrongEventsstrongp  pI have an Event abstract class which stores event type ID, like sop  precodepublic abstract class Event       public static final int NONE  0      private final int eventID      public Eventint eventID          this.eventID  eventID           public int getEventID          return eventID       codepre  pThen I have a Factory type class that extends Event, like sop  precodepublic abstract class BaseEvents extends Event       public static final int TRANSFORM  1      public BaseEventsint eventID          supereventID           public static class Transform extends BaseEvents           private final float rotation,                 tx,                 ty          public Transformfloat rotation, float tx, float ty              superTRANSFORM             this.rotation  rotation             this.tx  tx             this.ty  ty                   public float getRotation              return rotation                   public float getTx              return tx                   public float getTy          return ty                codepre  pIm trying to allow the ability to create new events simply by further extending BaseEvents.  Im using static inner classes mostly for organization. I dont want to create a separate class for every event.p  pstrongEvent Handlersstrongp  pTo avoid hardcoding handling of each Event in a given Processor Im using an EventHandler class.  My plan was to have one EventHandler class per Event.  Again Im using static inner classes for organization.p  pHeres the EventHandler abstract classp  precodepublic abstract class EventHandler       public void handleEvent event, Component component        codepre  pHeres the BaseEventHandlers Factory classp  precodepublic class BaseEventHandlers extends EventHandler       public static class Transform extends BaseEventHandlers           Override         public void handleEvent event, Component component              BaseEvents.Transform e  BaseEvents.Transform event             RenderComponent c  RenderComponent component             c.setRotatione.getRotation             c.setTxe.getTx             c.setTye.getTy                codepre  pThe example code Im showing is for a RenderComponent  RenderProcessor pairing.  We care about Transform events because they tell us where to repaint an object.p  pWhen EventManager notifies RenderProcessor of a new event, we check a Map using the Event ID to obtain the appropriate EventHandler, invoking its handle method. Note, Events are actually stored in a Processors queue and processed during an update call, like sop  precode... protected final MapltInteger, EventHandlergt eventHandlers  new HashMapltgt ...     Override     public void update          events.stream                 .forEachevent gt                      eventHandlers.getevent.getEventID.handleevent, components.getevent.getSourceEntityID                          events.clear      ... codepre  pstrongMy Problemstrongp  pIn the EventHandler, I need to cast both the Event and the Component abstract classes into appropriate concrete classes.  Im OK with being limited to one type of Event, but I cant limit myself to one type of Component.  What I want is to use Polymorphism and Overloading so that I have something likep  precode    ...         public void handleEvent event, RenderComponent component              BaseEvents.Transform e  BaseEvents.Transform event             component.setRotatione.getRotation             component.setTxe.getTx             component.setTye.getTy                   public void handleEvent event, OtherComponent component              BaseEvents.Transform e  BaseEvents.Transform event             component.setRotatione.getRotation             component.setTxe.getTx             component.setTye.getTy              ... codepre  pThis wont work because I only have access to the handleEvent event, Component component method of the abstract class overloading doesnt seem to care about the subclass.  One idea was to create an interface like Transformable and have RenderComponent and OtherComponent implement it.  This works when the data contained in the event is applicable to both Components, but it would be very easy for that not to be the case with some Events.  p  pFor example, say I have an event for closing a window called WindowClosed.  I need to play a sound, draw a closing animation, and update the number of open windows.  Thats one event three different ComponentsProcessors need to process.  In this example, the only interface that would work would be one that covered all methods needed by each Component, which in my opinion leads to messy, messy spaghetti code.p  pIs there perhaps a clever way to solve this using Genericsp

Negative 4126 pIve got a CSS file that I use to define a navigation bar. The navigation bar itself works and looks great. The problem is that it has taken over the LI and A tags so that when those tags are used later in the page, they look completely wrong. Im just getting starting with CSS files havent done any web development in a very long time so Im not sure how to fix the later tags while still being able to keep what makes the navbar work. I can get most of the properties fixed by assigning a class to the later LI tags, but not all for example margin and padding seem to not be changed by redeclaring them in the class.

Negative 4126 pAfter googling for a long time, I also posted this question on Quora but Im not sure Ill get an answer. So sorry for double posting this question.p  pI have a very nice MSI gaming laptop with a 250GB SSD and a 1TB HDD. It runs Windows 10 and has the Intel Rapid Storage Technology enabled.p  pI am trying to set up a dual boot with Ubuntu 14.04. I dont mind having the SSD cache disabled, because this technology is not available for anything nonWindows and Ubuntu will be my primary OS.p  pInstalling Ubuntu requires, among other things, that the Intel Rapid Storage Technology is DISABLED.p  pThis is done from within the Intel Rapid Storage Technology GUI in Windows.p  pAnd thats as far as I got... In most of my internet search results, people just say disable irst... or I disabeled irst first... In the rare occasions that people actually described how to do this, they say they went to Accelerate and clicked disable. An example of this with screenshots can be found in a hrefhttpdownload.asrock.commanualraidZ8720Extreme4IntelSmartResponseEnglish.pdf relnofollowthis pdfa from asrock dot com.p  pMy irst manager does not have the accelerate tab such as shown in the pdf screenshots. My manager has a Performance tab instead.p  pI do not have enough reputation yet to post screenshots that show exactly what I mean. I hope my description suffices If not, the screenshots are in my Quora question a hrefhttpswww.quora.comHowdoIdisableIntelRapidStorageTechnology relnofollowhttpswww.quora.comHowdoIdisableIntelRapidStorageTechnologyap  pSo...

Negative 4126 pI would like to check if my C compiler does Return Value Optimization RVO.p  pI wrote the following little program to do sop  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  struct s      int a, b   struct s foostruct s p      struct s v   1, 2      printffoo return value optimization sn,            p  ampv  true  false     return v   int mainvoid      struct s x     x  fooampx     return 0  codepre  pUnfortunately my gcc 4.9.2 compiler prints out  codefoo return value optimization falsecode regardless of the optimization level. With my clang 3.6.0 compiler as well. p  pstrongEditstrong Tried with the langage D and and its dmd compiler and it didnt work. Asking about it on the dlang forum I got an answer explaining what to do to get it working. And it then works as expected. See a hrefhttpforum.dlang.orgthreadcdqodqvcqcoaqtkmkixuforum.dlang.org relnofollowherea. So my assumption on NRVO was valid. Some compilers can optimize this as I expected. If my understanding is correct, c does it. However you need the ampamp and use the move function. Maybe my C code needs a little massage to trigger NRVO as was the case for D. p
Negative 4126 pI want to know if there is a function that can identify if the file name is short file name 8.3 file name. I dont want the full path of the file but just a way to identify if the given filename is following the a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwiki8.3filename relnofollowhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwiki8.3filenamea convention. So my input to the function would be just the filename and i need to output boolean yes or no.  e.g.p  pfile emdescription.htmem, output nop  pfile emdescri1.htmem, emdescri2.htmem, output yes.p

Negative 4126 pOn an article page, it is common to list the related content with their titles as links. I found that people usually use a lower level heading tag, like codeh3code, codeh4code to tag them. Something likep  precodelth3gtlta hrefrelatedarticle.htmlgtThe Related Articleltagtlth3gt codepre  pSemantically, I am not sure this is the best way to tag them. To me, heading tags are for marking the different parts of an article and the related articles are not really parts of the current article. They are merely related.p  pThe links probably will be in an unordered lists codelicodes but inside the codelicode, plain codepcode, codedivcode, codespancode tags feel a little underemphasised. p  pSo, semantically and also for SEO purposes, which logically should go together, what would be a proper tag to use for the titles of the related articlesp
