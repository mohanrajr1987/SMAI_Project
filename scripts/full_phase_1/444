Positive 444 pI have an MVC grid control that is passing back the collection to my controller as an object.

Positive 444 pI have a web app I want to convert to MVC based on the a hrefhttpwww.nathandavison.comarticle11customphpmvctutorialpart1introduction relnofollowNathan Davidson MVCFrameworka. I would like to know how strongin generalstrong I can manage a model that do not need a view, strongand particularlystrong, a database class.p  pI realize it would be more understandable with an example.

Each of them analyzes the enduser input, manipulates it, and uses the codequerycode method to execute some actions based on the results. The problem is that none of them is visible to the enduser, so there is not a View for any of them.p  pI thought I could just use a Model without associating it with any View, but the codeBaseControllercode An abstruct class for all Controllers to inherit from is always creating an instance of the View class Which of course, handle the View aspect of the app, so I must associate it with a View.p  pSo  now more understandable  my questions are the followp  ol listrongIn general  In a MVCbased app, how to handle a model that has no viewstrongli listrongIn my particular case  hot to handle the database How to organize my files and classesstrongli ol  pI google it but I could not find any reference to that issue, so I hope I am not reasking an answered question.p  pHope its not too stupid questions.

Positive 444 pI have a question about ASP.NET MVC and partialview rendered by ajax. Assuming I want to write a todo list app,for now I consider 2 partial views as following just for simplicity sakep  ol liTodoListli liEditFormli ol  pHere is what I want to do page loads with an ajax call renders ToDoList partial view. as you know the list will have a  link to edit and delete records tasks. what I want is when user clicks edit an ajax call renders EditForm which is a separate partial view when they finished editing and closed the partial view dialog box the TodoList have to get updated using ajax call.p  pNow my question is how should I handle this correctly  as who is responsible for watching this change and update particular partial viewp  pWhat I was thinking was a javascript module like a controller that sits in the say the page that content all this partial viewsmanages loading of these partial views and it loads the edit partial view when edit clicked by user and waits for a promisecallback to be donewhen edit was done. Then the same module will call update on the ToDoList partial view.p  pThe reason I chose this approach is to have multiple external javascripts each has their own responsibility and less dependency on the view itself. The thing is then I should have callbacks per each event that can happen by any partial views.p  pIf you guys can help me on this or tell me if there is a better way of doing it. I googled a lot but most of the solution have a lot of dependencies between partial views which I want to avoid.p  pAny comment would be appreciated. even if you guys think this is a wrong way to do the jobp

Negative 444 pSo some where i have a leak which is related to deleting an object under certain circumstances.p  pPremise   I have an NSMutableArray of Tree objects a Tree object knows how to draw itself.  I have a reference pointer Tree selected which basically points to whatever tree i last touched.  Note that the selected pointer is a weak reference.p  pOk, so far so good.p  pProblem The leak arises when i delete a Tree. From the list i make sure the tree being deleted is releasing everything internally before removing it from the array removing it from the array should automatically call release on it.p  pWhat i tried I noticed that my Tree selected pointer is being assigned the touched tree via the self propertyp  blockquote   pself.selected  treep blockquote  p...and by doing this i know that it is being retained. So what i tried to do was callp  blockquote   p[self.selected release]p blockquote  pI called this right after the tree is removed from the array. ...but at which point it crashes essentially stating it was already released.p  pQuestion Why am i getting this error message I removed it from the array, however my self.selected pointer still has a retained count, thus shouldnt i be releasing itp  pPerhaps I should set it to nil after the removal process Or, perhaps I should set it to autorelease BEFORE the removal processp

Negative 444 pWhat is the best way to implement a validator in Spring that accesses a DAO object but needs to return different error messages based on the DAO error  Should the DAO method throw different exceptions that the validator turns into proper error messages  Should the DAO return an enumeration so the validator can handle each return type separately if necessary  I suppose the validator can pass the org.springframework.validation.Errors object to the DAO, but that seems to tie the two classes too closely together.p  pI believe the best approach is the enumeration approach to avoid the overhead of exceptions.  Is there another way I should be consideringp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pActually, the enumeration would probably have to be a reference passed into the DAO as that method had to return the actual object.  Is this still the best approachp  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pThe issue is I need to retrieve information from the database in this particular case, not store it. In the validation class, I was checking if the value already exists which is why it needed the DAO, and if it already exists that is an error that I would show to the user on the page. I do need to validate that all fields on the form were filled in, so maybe thats the only thing I use the validator for. Then, how do I handle the error where the value already exists in the database The DAO is the only thing that will know that  what is the best way to communicate that error from the DAO to the web layer  p  pThe DAO method is currently returning the user object it is retrieving from the database  I can return null if there is an error, but that doesnt give me any granularity into the error details  its essentially a boolean at that point indicating if the record was found or not, but not why.p

Negative 444 pcodestdfindifcode takes a predicate in one of its overloaded function. Binders make it possible to write EqualityComparators for userdefined types and use them either for dynamic comparison or static comparison.p  pIn contrast the binary search functions of the standard library take a comparator and a codeconst Tampcode to the value that should be used for comparison. This feels inconsistent to me and could possibly more inefficient as the comparator has to be called with both arguments every time instead of having the constant argument bound to it. While it could be possible to implement codestdbinarysearchcode in a way to use codestdbindcode this would require all comparators to inherit from codestdbinaryfunctioncode.

Negative 444 pIts easy to let program figure out the dependency at compile time, with gcc MM. Nevertheless, link dependency deciding which libraries should be linked to seems to be difficult to figure out. This issue become emergent when multiple targets with individual libraries to link to are needed.p  pFor instance, three dynamic library targets t1.so, t2.so and t3.so needs to be built. t1.so needs math library lm, while t2 and t3 dont. It would be tedious to write separate rules. A single rule requiring the three targets linked with math library saves the trouble. However, it causes inflation of target size since math library is unused for t2.so and t3.so.p  pAny ideas p

Negative 444 pI need to perform pre and postprocessing of all incomming requests to a web server. The functionality is both urllevel access restriction and language translation but also other special cases that need to be handled globaly.p  pTypically this can be achieved with servlet filters but when the number of web applications grow it becomes desirable not to bundle the filters with every application since all applications need to be rebuilt and redeployed when making a change to a filter.p  pInstead I would like to install the filters globally on the server and I have found two possible solutions of which Im not satisfied with any of them.p  ol lipOn Tomcat it is possible to deploy serverwide filters in the lib directory and configure the server web.xml to map them to incoming requests. The problem I see is that any filter dependencies also need to be deployed globally in the lib directory. From what I understand this can cause hard to solve dependency conflicts with installed applications. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions267953managinglibrariesintomcathttpstackoverflow.comquestions267953managinglibrariesintomcatapli lipDeploying the filters in a simple web application that mainly acts as a proxy would at least bundle the filters with their corresponding dependencies. This application can then be deployed on the server and take all incoming requests before forwarding them to the target application using the crossContext config parameter. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2815370requestdispatcherforwardbetweentomcatinstanceshttpstackoverflow.comquestions2815370requestdispatcherforwardbetweentomcatinstancesa However, this requires fiddling with the urls such that all links point to the proxy.pli ol  pNeither of these solutions seem to be satisfactory. They are both platform dependent since they rely on Tomcat. They also both seem to have possible problems and require special handling of dependencies.p  pWhat is the best practise when using server wide functionalityp

Negative 444 pHi there i am trying to load an XML from a remote host useing node.js. The problem is that german umlaute like  are broken. Like in the browser this usualy is a simple encoding problem. But since the XML on the remote host is encoded in iso88592 i had no success getting the letters back to work. p  pThe functionality is very simple.  I simply use the default http client integrated in node.js to connect to a remote host with a simple get request. p  pSome env facts The remote system uses iso88592 encoding.  The encoding is currectly set in the response header. The chars are unrecoverable broken in the data chunk received by response.onDatachunkp  pNode.js is running on Version 0.2 on da default debian server.p  pThe code is based on the default httpClient like descriped in the node.js documentation.p  pI tried the following response.defaultAsciiEncoding truefalse response.encoding  UFT8asciip  pused a utf8 encoderdecoder to encodedecode the chunk  after this failed i tried to encodedecode the whole response bodyp  pI am not very familiar with useing buffers and i guess the problem must be in that direction. Or node.jsor the httpClient simply cant handle other enc types by default witch is my second guess. In this case i need to write my own http client useing the net lib i think. I just want to make sure i dont walk into the wrong direction p  pTHX for helping or even glamphf while guessing  p

Negative 444 pThis works, and I cant imagine how it might cause problems, but visual studio gives me an warning and that makes me sad.  Im just wondering if doing something like this might ever cause problemsp  pI have a custom timer that acts like a Wait for some number of milliseconds and then execute a function.  It looks like thisp  precodePublic Class MyTimer     Inherits Timers.Timer      Public Event Done      Public Sub NewByVal interval As Double, ByVal repeat As Boolean, ByVal Work As DoneEventHandler         Me.AutoReset  Not repeat     End Sub      Private Sub ElapsedToDoneConvert Handles Me.Elapsed         RaiseEvent Done     End Sub End Class codepre  pI use it like thisp  precodeDim Timer as New MyTimer1000, False, Sub                                         ..code..

End Sub codepre  pThe first case waits one seconds and then executes ..code.., the second case executes ..code.. repeatedly every one second.p  pNow the question  Imagine I have a form with a textbox called TextBox1 on it.

If it isnt, it displays a message box and stops checking.p  pI get a warning that Timer is used before it has been assigned a value, but it is used in the statement that assigns its value.  The timers interval is required to be greater than zero.  Is there anything about this that I dont understand that could cause problemsp  pThanks for the helpp
Negative 444 pMy WPF app has a window with various text boxes and a WebBrowser control.br The WebBrower control is used to show a web site I doesnt own and then a Login button in the WPF window fills the fields in the site from the text boxes.  p  pThe problem is that the web site calls focus method on one of its input fields on load, and that still the focus from the text box in my WPF window.

To do that, I need to get a JDBC connection from the pool and then use it in multiple different methods.  I need to use the same JDBC connection in multiple DAOs to string it all together into a single database transaction.  I can explicitly pass around the JDBC connection to each DAO that needs it, but that would require me to change a LOT of method signatures, plus a LOT of unit tests which goes against the quickly part.  p  pI am trying to come up with a good way put the JDBC connection somewhere and then just grab it in the methods that need it without having to explicitly pass it around everywhere.  We cant use Spring, JPA, or Hibernate on this project because the support team wont support those technologies.  I can put the JDBC connection into an EJB, but I am not sure how reliable that would be.  I could create a custom Singleton to manage database connections for each user session, but I would have to be careful about thread safety.  If anyone has tried to do something like this before, I would appreciate some advice. p
Negative 444 pLets assume one has two servers, one is used for frontend stuff one application the other is used for backend stuff the other application. The frontend server delivers data through a webserver to the backend server. p  pFurthermore, the two applications use classes object instances to communicate. So, to send data about foo from one to another, foo is filled with values, serialized and send to the other party. It would then be deserialized and an instance of the same class would then be filled with the incoming data. p  pWhats the best way to have a consistent architecture for these classes foo is the same on both sides. Should one have only one file foo.php and distribute it while deploying Or is there a better wayp

N to 0 should look just like 0 to N. But when I look at these amplitudes, I dont see any mirrored data. Google seems to indicate that the output should be from 0 to N just on both sides of the spectrum. So I should be able to take the data from output.length12 to output.length1. The negative amplitudes are moving faster than the sample rate and the positive amplitudes are moving slower than the sample rate. Did I understand this correctly p

Negative 444 pA question like mine has been a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions531759cvolatiledoubleaskeda, but mine is a bit different.  The question is, Why is the volatile keyword not allowed in codeCcode on types codeSystem.Doublecode and codeSystem.Int64code, etc.p  pOn first blush, I answered my colleague, Well, on a 32bit machine, those types take at least two ticks to even enter the processor, and the .Net framework has the intention of abstracting away processorspecific details like that.  To which he responds, Its not abstracting anything if its preventing you from using a feature because of a processorspecific problemp  pHes implying that a processorspecific detail should not show up to a person using a framework that abstracts details like that away from the programmer.  So, the framework or C should abstract away those and do what it needs to do to offer the same guarantees for codeSystem.Doublecode, etc. whether thats a Semaphore, memory barrier, or whatever.  I argued that the framework shouldnt add the overhead of a Semaphore on codevolatilecode, because the programmer isnt expecting such overhead with such a keyword, because a Semaphore isnt necessary for the 32bit types.  The greater overhead for the 64bit types might come as a surprise, so, better for the .Net framework to just not allow it, and make you do your own Semaphore on larger types if the overhead is acceptable.p  pThat led to our investigating what the volatile keyword is all about.  see a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryzdxzk5cw.aspxthisa page.  That page states, in the notesp  blockquote   pIn C, using the volatile modifier on a field guarantees that all access to that field uses VolatileRead or VolatileWrite.p blockquote  pHmmm.....codeVolatileReadcode and codeVolatileWritecode both support our 64bit types My question, then, is, p  blockquote   pWhy is the volatile keyword not allowed in codeCcode on types codeSystem.Doublecode and codeSystem.Int64code, etc.p blockquote

Negative 444 pBefore I even ask, let me get the obvious answer out of the way emThe codeICollectionltTgtcode interface includes a codeRemovecode method to remove an arbitrary element, which codeQueueltTgtcode and codeStackltTgtcode cant really support since they can only remove end elements.emp  pOK, I realize that. Actually, my question is not specifically about the codeQueueltTgtcode or codeStackltTgtcode collection types rather, its about the design decision of not implementing codeICollectionltTgtcode for emanyem generic type that is essentially a collection of codeTcode values.p  pHeres what I find odd. Say I have a method that accepts an arbitrary collection of codeTcode, and for the purpose of the code Im writing it would be useful to know the size of the collection. For example the below code is trivial, for illustration onlyp  precode Argument validation omitted for brevity. static IEnumerableltTgt FirstHalfltTgtthis ICollectionltTgt source      int i  0     foreach T item in source              yield return item         if i gt source.Count  2                      break                codepre  pNow, theres really no reason why this code couldnt operate on a codeQueueltTgtcode or a codeStackltTgtcode, except that those types dont implement codeICollectionltTgtcode. They emdoem implement codeICollectioncode, of courseIm guessing mainly for the codeCountcode property alonebut that leads to weird optimization code like thisp  precode OK, so to accommodate those bastard QueueltTgt and StackltTgt types,  we will just accept any IEnumerableltTgt... static IEnumerableltTgt FirstHalfltTgtthis IEnumerableltTgt source      int count  CountQuicklyltTgtsource      ...     Then, assuming weve got a collection type with a Count property,  well use that... static int CountQuicklyltTgtIEnumerable collection       Note I realize this is basically what Enumerable.Count already does      minus the exception I am just including it for clarity.     var genericColl  collection as ICollectionltTgt     if genericColl  null              return genericColl.Count           var nonGenericColl  collection as ICollection     if nonGenericColl  null              return nonGenericColl.Count            ...or else well just throw an exception, since this collection      cant be counted quickly.     throw new ArgumentExceptionCannot count this collection quickly  codepre  pWouldnt it make more sense to just strongabandon the codeICollectioncode interface completelystrong I dont mean drop the implementation, of course, as that would be a breaking change I just mean, stop using it, and simply implement codeICollectionltTgtcode with explicit implementation for members that dont have a perfect matchp  pI mean, look at what codeICollectionltTgtcode offersp  ul licodeCountcode  codeQueueltTgtcode and codeStackltTgtcode both have this.li licodeIsReadOnlycode  codeQueueltTgtcode and codeStackltTgtcode easily emcouldem have this.li licodeAddcode  codeQueueltTgtcode could implement this explicitly with codeEnqueuecode, as could codeStackltTgtcode with codePushcode.li licodeClearcode  Check.li licodeContainscode  Check.li licodeCopyTocode  Check.li licodeGetEnumeratorcode  Check duh.li licodeRemovecode  emThis is the only one that codeQueueltTgtcode and codeStackltTgtcode dont have a perfect match for.emli ul  pAnd heres the real kicker codeICollectionltTgt.Removecode emreturns a codeboolcodeem so an explicit implementation for codeQueueltTgtcode could totally for example check if the item to be removed is emactuallyem the head element using codePeekcode, and if so, call codeDequeuecode and return codetruecode, otherwise return codefalsecode. codeStackltTgtcode could easily be given a similar implementation with codePeekcode and codePopcode.p  pAll right, now that Ive written about a thousand words on why emIem think this would be possible, I pose the obvious question strongwhy emdidntem the designers of codeQueueltTgtcode and codeStackltTgtcode implement this interfacestrong That is, what were the design factors which I am probably not considering that led to the decision that this would be the wrong choice Why was codeICollectioncode implemented insteadp  pI am wondering if, in designing my emownem types, there are any guiding principles I should consider with respect to interface implementation that I might be overlooking in asking this question. For example, is it just considered bad practice to explicitly implement interfaces that arent fully supported in general if so, this would seem to conflict with, e.g., codeListltTgtcode implementing codeIListcode Is there a emconceptualem disconnect between the concept of a queuestack and what codeICollectionltTgtcode is meant to representp  pBasically, I sense that there must be a pretty good reason codeQueueltTgtcode for example emdoesntem implement codeICollectionltTgtcode, and I dont want to just go blindly forward designing my own types and implementing interfaces in an inappropriate manner without being informed and fully thinking through what Im doing.p  pI do apologize for the superlong question.p
Negative 444 pI have my database properly set to UTF8 and am dealing with a database containing Japanese characters.  If I do SELECT ... from the mysql command line, I properly see the Japanese characters.  When pulling data out of the database and displaying it on a webpage, I see it properly.p  pHowever, when viewing the table data in phpMyAdmin, I just see garbage text.  ie.p  p...p  pHow can I get phpMyAdmin to display the characters in Japanesep  pThe character encoding on the HTML page is set to UTF8.p  pEditp  pI have tried an export of my database and opened up the .sql file in geany.  The characters are still garbled even though the encoding is set to UTF8.

Negative 444 pSo heres my rather openended question. Ive spent the last 7 hours creating numerous different concepts for a simple CYOA game engine. Create Your Own Adventure I have no problem with displayingupdating graphics, the UI, playing audio, etc. but its the seemingly simplest of things thats really frustrating me, the core engine itself.p  pHeres the idea...p  pThere are 4 TextViews prompt, option1, option2 and option3. When the game begins the user is met with a prompt and 3 options. They then click on an option and all 4 text views update based on what they chose. If the user chooses say...Buy a hotdog. from the What would you like to buy prompt, the next screen would say something like Choose a condiment with 3 different condiments, etc.p  pIve tried ArrayLists, Bundles, HashMaps, etc. but nothing seems to work without some seriously convoluted code. I am at a complete stand still and my wits end and have no idea how to create an optimized mechanism for this in JavaAndroid. p  pAny ideasp

However  this only occurs if you select a value which has not already been selected in another cell of the datagrid Selecting a unique value causes the box to show emptyp  pMy code is as followsp

Negative 444 pIm trying to build  architect a security solution for an intranet application and Im wondering if implementing a WIF level solution is worth it, given the requirements.br Essentially, I have the following things that are considerationsbrp  ul liThe general platform is ASP.NET MVC 3  Windows Servers  SQL Server 2008 R2 database.li liInformation comes into our system from an outside vendor that provides a workflow software solution li liSince the vendor software only covers part of the companys typical workflow, theyll be sending us data as a REST call. Our end uses WCF rest calls to receive this data.li liA VPN tunnel is supposed to be built to the outside vendors servers as part of the security.li liTheres pressure from the top that this VPN isnt enough security. Also, as there are authorization issues some users shouldnt have access to some data, we should have something that identifies users on our end as well as the vendors end to insure information is from the right person, with the proper rights to make these changes.li liThe outside vendor has their own security system, but nothing we can truly tap into, so Im not sure what, if anything, we can do to synchronize security.li liThe piece of the workflow that we pick up is what is handled via MVC 3  SQL Server.li liOur company uses Active Directory for user management, and Id like it if I can lean on it if possible. Ideally, Id like to not introduce Yet Another Password to our users, since theyll have their work logins, the outside workflow vendor logins, and logins to yet other vendors.li liWhile the solution is initially going to be part of the company Im in now, it might roll out to other sister companies that are under our same Active Directory.li liWhile using the workflow solution will be limited to users in active directory, it is likely that wed have outside users that wed prefer not to give active directory accounts to that will view reports running on SSRS. brbr  li ul  pSorry if this is really long, but I hope that providing as much information as possible, I can get the best answers  solutions  practices  recommendations possible for this problem.

Negative 444 pI rather like the diamond syntax for generics that Java 7 introduces  not so much from a time saving perspective after all most IDEs fill that bit in for you anyway but just because it makes the code look a bit cleaner.

Is there an IDE shortcut Im using Netbeans but obviously can open the project in any free IDE to do the task or something else that can automatically switch the existing generic code to use diamond syntaxp

Negative 444 pI wanted to know if there exists a somewhat simple, but secure, method to encrypt stringsnot passwords, with a password which is not stored on the server, in PHP.p  pIve checked a hrefhttpwww.tonymarston.netphpmysqlencryption.htmlA reversible password encryption routine for PHPa, but Im unsure if it is secure enough if intruders have access to the server and source.p  pWere talking about a automatic system where a computer sends a request to a server, which stores information in a log. So Im thinking I could send the encryption password in the request header, preferably encrypted, but then it would be difficult to decrypt without storing the password somehow on the server.

It gets to around 100,000 bytes after 10 minutes and will eventually crash due to running out of memory. I know the malloc needs to be freed at some point. Each file ranges from around 3MB to 10MB, and Id imagine the operation should only take a few seconds, but my code is obviously bad.p

Essentially, there are two independent issues in this questionp  ul lipHow should an animation be viewed from the language level I believe, the best way is to view each frame as a single page. With codecopypagecode incremental changes can be realized with low effort. Sadly, that semantics of codecopypagecode is only present in Level 1 and 2.  In Level 3, the meaning of codecopypagecode changed to codeshowpagecode. I did  many years ago  a a hrefhttpwww.complang.tuwien.ac.atulrichgsdb relnofollowlittle modification to ghostscripta to delay all visible changes up to codecopypagecode or codeshowpagecode. In this manner, a single codeXCopyAreacode containing the changed area is performed stronglocallystrong on the server that is, the display.pli lipHow should actual changes on the visual display be synchronized to avoid artefacts that where not present in the graphics described The irregular flicker you see is not a privilege of PostScript, it seems to be present in any doublebuffered system I have seen so far.

Negative 444 pI need some advice about what kind of IPC and what kind of message queue types might be the best kind to use for my specific circumstances producersconsumers, priority amp timing etc.p  pIm working on a realtime audiographics app in C for Linux Ubuntu which uses OpenGL and SDL graphics, ALSA audio MIDI, POSIX pthreads, and custom libraries for peripheral hardware. Currently there is a main thread and a thread for communication with the peripheral devices. The main thread combines the main graphics draw cycle with the code which controls the recordingplayback of audio or more correctly, MIDI  events set up for looped recordingplayback. p  pI need to separate the audio into its own thread as the main thread is not currently strictly timed i.e. the main draw cycle does not always take the same amount of time to finish an iteration, depending on whats being drawn from one  iteration to the next and this is preventing the playback of audio loops firing of MIDI events from being constant in timing.p  pThe audio thread needs to be strictly timed so that recordingplayback is consistent, and it needs to receive trigger events from the peripheralhandler thread and note there may be more than one peripheral thread producing events, but not wait for them long enough that the playback timing is interfered with at all. The trigger events sent by the peripheral threads need to be synchronized with the audio thread so that when a user triggers the playingrecording of a note, it plays at the right time i.e. immediately, when playing a note, or recorded into the correct position in the recording loop. p  pThe audio thread sends draw events to the graphics thread which I guess will remain the main program thread and the graphics thread should draw them as soon as possible, so that the graphics events appear synchronized with the audio playback events  though the graphics thread does not have to be as strictly timed as the audio thread. p  pI hope thats clear enough for people to be able to suggest what I should try out. Im not too familiar with queue algorithms, blocking, locks and mutexes etc, but I understand the basic concepts, so if anyone can suggest which kind of queue or messaging algorithms I should look at, and link to any examplesimplementations in C, that would be great.

Negative 444 pIm using Jersey to build a REST API to a service. Id like to be able to accept and return both JSON and XML, and have this mostly working but I dont like the default mapped flavor of JSON that Jersey likes to spit out.p  pI know about the newer natural notation from a hrefhttpjersey.java.netnonavdocumentationlatestjson.html relnofollowhttpjersey.java.netnonavdocumentationlatestjson.htmla, which Ill quote at length because it makes obvious the problems with the default mapped notationp  blockquote   pAfter using mapped JSON notation for a while, it was apparent, that a   need to configure all the various things manually could be a bit   problematic. To avoid the manual work, a new, natural, JSON notation   was introduced in Jersey version 1.0.2. With natural notation, Jersey   will automatically figure out how individual items need to be   processed, so that you do not need to do any kind of manual   configuration. Java arrays and lists are mapped into JSON arrays, even   for singleelement cases. Java numbers and booleans are correctly   mapped into JSON numbers and booleans, and you do not need to bother   with XML attributes, as in JSON, they keep the original namesp blockquote  pand would like to use it everywhere, but I havent been able to figure out how to. Im instantiatingconfiguring Jersey via Tomcats XML config files  using what I believe is the normal dance with servletservletclassinitparam tags  but I havent been able to find documentation on whether or how its possible to specify JSONConfiguration options from there.p  pIve also tried implementing my own ContextResolver which applies a JSONJAXBContext I instantiated from Java code, where I can apply JSONConfiguration.natural an example of this looks like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma2877953275581this answera. This works, but only for types I explicitly list out in that code, and pass to the JSONJAXBContext constructor. Not only is this extra code to write and maintain, and change if I add more data classes, but it doesnt work for things like List.p  pIs there a way to tell Jersey to just use the natural notation instead of mapped notation, always and for all typesp

Negative 444 pI use lwIP to add networking functionality to my system. On my platform i built a buffer that i want to send every time it is full. This can happen quite quickly. The system is directly connected to a switch in a private LAN.  Initially the sending of data had a very large time gap in between of 2 seconds. Additionally the packets had a size of 720 bytes if my memory serves me correctly. The used buffer currently has capacity for about 20000 bytes and I might decide to increase this in the future. The network has 100 mbit speeds and I would like to come close to these speeds on my platform.p  pWhen searching for the cause of the slow speeds I ended up at lwIPs configuration. Prior to that I altered my sending mechanism. I use the raw lwIP API and at present I write the data as followsp  precodetcpwriteltpcbgt, const void data, ltbytesgt, TCPWRITEFLAGCOPY ltbytesgt is at most tcpsndbufltpcbgt codepre  pI know the copy flag creates a performance hit, but this is added because I dont want to overwrite data before its actually sent. and the flag isnt the main problem but something to polish once its working properly In a prior solution i omitted the flag and simply waited for all bytes to be ACKd after forcing data to be send after writing by calling tcpoutput by using the callback function. This might be worse performance wise and I dont think its relatedp  pI played a little with the settings in the of lwIP and that seemed to make some difference. I think the window size especially made a difference although Im not quite sure. At the moment I increased the window size significantly and even though I get a burst of packets with about 2ms between them instead of 2s this is followed with a long period of nothing and then a burst again. I want it to continuously send at the speed it should be capable of which should be 100 mbit at most but atleast 10 mbit is not weird to expect, rightp  pI loaded up wireshark to see what was happening.p  p192.168.1.26  is my desktop computer running windows. 192.168.1.192 is the embedded system thats using lwIP. p  pInitially I send a start request from the desktop to the lwIP system, letting the system know it should start sending the buffer each time it is full.

After stripping the code to match the needed basic funcitonality of the new project do the first commit to keep its history clean from useless things. Maybe it takes some time to conform this goal. Also, there is no way to merge enhancements done in the old project.pli lipBranch the old code and adapt it to its new job step by step. That means the two projects will stay entangled inside one repository, that has one name, one README on GitHub etc.pli lipCreate the new project, beginning with a minimal main part, and another library project, serving as a common collection for both the old and the new project. However, with HTML and JS development, that makes many headaches as importing is complex in JS, impossible in HTML, there is the need to pull two repos to get each of the project running etc.pli ul  pWhat would you do Are there any GIT tricks that would support mep

Negative 444 pI am looking to create an android based game. I am planning for this to eventually be on the OUYA.

I am using OpenGL ES. Id also like it to work on desktops too. I am assuming that players will either have a controller or a keyboard and mouse touch MIGHT work as well, but tweaking is needed.

Negative 444 pIs there a nice way to restrict a method to only take members of a enumset instead of any enum that enum member is a part of  I mean at compile time, clearly I can check at runtime.  I have an enum that represents a complex key into a message bundle.  I want all those keys in 1 file for maintainability.  They have different flavors though, and those are in different EnumSets.p  pI want people to be able to call methods and be restricted to just calling with one of the enumset values instead of the whole thing.

Negative 444 pFibers are a relatively new concept to me. Im aware that each fibers stack size is limited to 4kB and I keep reading that I should beware of this. What exactly are the real world consequences of this limitp  pEditp  pIt seems that this 4kB limitation isnt such a hindrance after all and it takes a good number of local variables 4,045 within the fiber itself to cause a SystemStackError to be raised.p  precodecount  0 loop do   count  1   puts count   varlist  String.new   count.times do i     varlist  ai  1n   end   s  fiber  Fiber.new do n varlist n end n fiber.resume   evals end codepre  pNot the most elegant code but it does seem to demonstrate the limitations of a fibers stack. It seems as though its only return values, local variables all of which contain a reference to an object on the heap and method calls get put on the stack. I havent tested whether the local variables etc in methods that are called from a fiber are part of the fibers stack.p  pEdit 2p  pModified the above code. It does appear that variables etc in called methods become part of the fibers stack. If this is the case, then the call depth even without recursion could be more of an issue as methods themselves are likely to require more space on the stack than variables which seem to be transparent references to objects on the heap.p  pThe following code fails on the 4,031st iteration and indicates variables in called methods become part of the fibers stackp  precodecount  0 loop do   count  1   puts count   varlist  String.new   count.times do i     varlist  ai  1n   end   m  def methn varlist n end   evalm   fiber  Fiber.new do     meth   end   fiber.resume end codepre  pEdit 3p  pJust tried running the initial code example on Rubinius 2.0. Its fibers dont seem to have a 4kB stack limit, although beyond about 3,500th iteration it becomes increasingly and noticeably slow, and at around the 5,000th iteration its averaging about one iteration a second. I dont know if there is a limit with RBX because I quit execution at just over 5,100 iterations. RBX is also using several times more memory than MRI 1.9.3.p  pJRuby 1.7 also doesnt seem to have a 4kB stack size for fibers and if fibers have a max stack size its unknown to me. I completed 5,000 iterations of the first code example without problems, although as can be expected, the JVM chewed through a few hundred MB of RAM.p

But the library has quite some dependencies on other managed libraries around 15 dlls so I need to distribute those as well. p  pWhen the users of my API have created an application they again have to make sure to distribute all those dlls along with the application. To me it would seem better if they had just one dll to consider.p  pThe main downside I can see to using embedded dlls is that they must be unpacked to a temporary folder before being loaded dynamically, which may or may not have performance and robustness issues.p

Negative 444 pI have an Azure worker role running in a an extra small instance. All it does is dequeue all the messages from a storage queue, and insert them into table storage in chunks of 100.p  pI was wondering if it makes sense to spawn multiple threads when inserting these chunks even though the instance is only a single core. My thought was that since insertion is an asynchronous process though Im using the API calls that make it look synchronous that maybe the core spends most its time waiting and I may see a performance boost by inserting in parallel. p  pThe inserts go into 10 table partitions, so it would be really easy to paralellize across partitions. Is that my best bet Can I use PLINQ to do this I know that PLINQ optimizes thread usage based on the number of cores, so would it even spawn multiple threads in this case What if I used the async versions of the insert calls, wouldnt that have the effect of spawning multiple threads when the calls to table storage returnedp  pThanksp

Negative 444 pHeres my dilemma.  I have a series of tables with leads from our various contact forms.  We also have tables for spam that comes in on our forms.  But occasionally, a lead may get routed incorrectly to a spam table.  So I need to move that lead from one table to the other, which means inserting it one and deleting it from the other.p  pAs I understand it, when Backbone calls the codesavecode method, it checks to see if that id exists in the table.  If it doesnt, it makes a POST request.  If it does, it makes a PUT request.  I need to be able to force Backbone to make a POST request, so that Laravel can call the right RESTful action.p  pSee the problem is that if Backbone makes a PUT request to say, codesendmessage52code the 52 being the ID of the lead in the sendmessagespam table, it will updateoverwrite the existing lead with the ID of 52.  I want to make a POST request to codesendmessagecode obviously without an ID.p  pI can force Backbone to use a different codeurlRootcode, but how do I force it to make a POST when I call codesavecodep

Negative 444 pIm trying to come up with a simple way using Ruby to scramble or mask some numeric data, in order to create a dummy data set from live data. I want to keep the data as close to the original format as possible that is, preserve all nonnumeric characters. The numbers in the data correspond to individual identification numbers, which sometimes are keys used in a relational database. So, if the numeric string occurs more than once, I want to map it consistently to the same ideally unique value. Once the data has been scrambled, I dont need to be able to reverse the scrambling.p  pIve created a scramble function that takes a string and generates a simple hash to map numbers to new values the function only maps the numeric digits and leaves everything else as is. For added security, each time the function is called, the key is regenerated. Thus, the same phrase will produce two different results each time the function is called. p  precodemodule HashModule   def self.scramblestr     numHash      0.upto9 do i       numHash[i.tos]rand10.tos     end      output String.newstr     output.gsubd dod       d.replace numHash[d]     end      puts Input   str     puts Hash Key   numHash.tos     puts Output   output   end end  HashModule.scramble566098 NO PCT 001 HashModule.scramble566098 NO PCT 001 codepre  pThis produces the following outputp  precodeInput 566098 NO PCT 001 Hash Key 0gt9, 1gt4, 2gt8,             3gt9, 4gt4, 5gt8,             6gt4, 7gt0, 8gt2,             9gt1 Output 844912 NO PCT 994  Input 566098 NO PCT 001 Hash Key 0gt2, 1gt0, 2gt9,             3gt8, 4gt4, 5gt5,             6gt7, 7gt4, 8gt2,             9gt0 Output 577202 NO PCT 220 codepre  pGiven the data setp  precodePTO NO PC R5632893423 IP R566788882001 NO PCT AMB PTO NO AMBCALL IP A566788882 1655543AACHM IP 56664320000000 005663331 codepre  pI first extract all the numbers to an array.

Negative 444 pI have written a project on .NET 4 and am currently in the process of allowing it to run on Windows Phone as well. I am using HtmlAgilityPack, a well known library which allows Linq queries over HTML, and am only using the emLoadHtmlem and emLinqem interfaces it provides.p  pHaving converted the class libraries from .NET 4 to PCL Portable Class Library with support for .NET 4 and WP8, I cannot seem to use the HtmlAgilityPack library anymore. strongIs there a way to allow HtmlAgilityPack to function correctly under a PCL project or is there a variable alternative with a similar Linq interface that does work as intendedstrongp  pstrongEDITstrong HtmlAgilityPack provides 9 different versions, none of which are compatible with PCL. None of them resolve dependencies from the references. For some versions, it may appear that it does but upon usage an error will be thrown with the usual cannot load, unresolved dependencies.p  pstrongEDIT 2strong Since it easy to miss a small comment, Ill update this answer with the solution I came up with.

I assume I should set body opacity to 0 in CSS, and use JavaScript code to fade in the page. p  pI have to use MooTools, more specifically, version 1.2.6, because that library is already linked to the page and shouldnt be upgraded to a more recent version, for a number of reasons. p  pOne of the StackOverflow experts suggested this MooTools snippet as a solutionp  precodewindow.addEventload, function    body.setmorph, duration 300.morphopacity 1  codepre  pstrongPROBLEMstrong for some reason, instead of smoothly fading in the page, the snippet makes the background appear right away, and then, a second or so later, the page pops up, without any fadein effect. Most likely its me whos not doing things right. p  pId appreciate a bit of advice from a knowledgeable person. p

Negative 444 pI have two repeaters, one nested in the other. Im outputting a list of course titles in the parent repeater and the dates of those courses in the child repeater. This part is working fine. But, not all the course titles necessarily have dates available at any given time, so I want to be able to put a message up under each Course title that currently has no dates saying to check back regularly, blah, blah, blah. Ive put the label in the footer template of the nested repeater with visibilityfalse and am trying to set the visibilitytrue at the appropriate time in the ItemDataBound Sub. Unfortunately, this is not working. Im not getting any errors, the label just isnt showing up. Im really hoping someone can help me out with my code or suggest an alternate way to do this.

Negative 444 pCurrently Im working on a huge project that involves thousands of lines of CSS, JavaScript and a bunch of images. Minifying CSS style sheets and JavaScript files with added compression helps a lot, but it still isnt perfect.p  pFor preloading images in CSS stylesheets, I have found a bunch of plugins, including here on stackoverflow. However, since there are a lot of jQuery and JavaScript libraries  preloading just CSS images in stylesheets doesnt help my cause at all. Is there a way to preload the CSS files themselves, along with images found in those files, and JavaScript libraries in one go I would use such a feature after confirming user credentials, and after preloading the required content redirecting users to the inner content.p  pAlso I could easily provide an array of files needed for preloading, without having JavaScript to parse any files.p

Negative 444 pIm trying to convert class variables into instance variables on runtime, similar to what goes on in the Django ORM where the class variables of various types are converted into instance variables of the same types on runtime. p  pIm using a metaclass to collect the class variables of certain types into a list and then setting them as instance variables on instantiation. Ive tried deleting the original class variables and also keeping them and Im getting different results in both cases, both undesirable. p  ul liI created a simple Field object which uses the strongemgetemstrong and strongemsetemstrong descriptors to convert values into types. A simple implementation of Field is the Textfield which unicodes the value on strongemgetemstrong.li liOn class creation the metaclass collects all attributes of type Field into a listli liThe field list is then set to the classs as meta[fields]. li liWhen the class is instantiated into an object those meta[fields] are then setattr into the object. In one use case the original class var is deleted before hand. li liI then test by creating two objects, setting the textfield attribute of one to some text, expecting the strongemgetemstrong and strongemsetemstrong to be called and both having different non conflicting values.li ul  pWhen the class variable is deleted, setting the Field value does not actually call strongemsetemstrong or strongemgetemstrong and the field simply changes type to a str. When I dont delete the class variable, the two objects instantiated share the values between them. p  pIve diluted my code into the code below which can be saved into a file and run with codepython test.pycode or imported into a python shell. Setting DELETECLASSVAR to True will delete the class variables to account for both test cases.p  pObviously Im missing something here. Failing to get this to work Id use regular instance variable throughout but I quite like the Django model and I have gone through the Django code without success where the class variables set on a model then become its instance variables with some degree of type safety and specific methods set into them.p  pThanksp  precode Set to True to delete class variables DELETECLASSVAR  False  class Fieldobject      def initself, args, kwargs         self.value  None         self.args  args         self.kwargs  kwargs      def getself, instance, owner         print get called, instance         return self.topython      def setself, instance, value         print set called, instance, value         self.value  self.frompythonvalue      def topythonself         return self.value      def frompythonself, value         return value  class TextFieldField     def topythonself         return unicodeself.value  class ModelMetaClasstype       def newcls, name, bases, attrs         print Creating new class s  name         obj  superModelMetaClass, cls.newcls, name, bases, attrs         print class, cls           keys  attrs.keys           fields  []         for key in keys              if isinstanceattrs[key], Field                 field  attrs.popkey                  fields.append namekey, value field             setattrobj, meta,  fields fields          print 80         return obj   class Modelobject      metaclass  ModelMetaClass      def initself         print ROOT MODEL INIT, self.meta         print 80         superModel, self.init         metafields  self.meta.getfields,[]         for field in metafields             f  field[value]             if DELETECLASSVAR and hasattrself, field[name]                 delattrself.class, field[name]             setattrself, field[name], f.classf.args, f.kwargs  class BasicAdModelModel     def initself         superBasicAdModel, self.init         self.id  None         self.createdat  None         self.lastmodified  None   class SpecialAdModelBasicAdModel     textfield  TextField      def initself         superSpecialAdModel, self.init         print INIT SPECIALAD, self.meta         print 80  print  creating two models, Ad1 and Ad2 Ad1  SpecialAdModel Ad2  SpecialAdModel  print  Ad1 textfield attribute is, Ad1.textfield print  Setting Ad1 TextField instance to Text, expecting set on Textfield to be called  Ad1.textfield  Text if DELETECLASSVAR     print  If the class var was deleted on instantiation get is not called here, and value is now str print tNew value is , Ad1.textfield  print  Getting Ad2.textfield, expecting get to be called and no value. if DELETECLASSVAR     print  If the class var was deleted  again get is not called, attribute repalced with str print tAd2.textfield, Ad2.textfield  print  Setting Ad2 text field  Ad2.textfield  A different text if not DELETECLASSVAR     print  When  class var is not deleted, the two separate instances share the value later set on Ad2  print tAd2.textfield,Ad2.textfield  print tAd1.textfield, Ad1.textfield  codepre

Negative 444 pIm using phantomjs to render several specialized html pages to PDF since this is a service that will need to scale, Im trying to reduce as much overhead as possible.  All pages are the same structure, use the same CSS, and are in most ways similar, so I decided to reuse the same html page and just call javascript to replace the content. This way it doesnt have to reload the CSS and web fonts and such.p  pTo make things slightly more complicated, Im controlling the render from node.js using a rest interface I created using phantom.jss webserver interface.

How do I that test in an addon packagep  pA solution using either pure a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiR28programminglanguage29 relnofollowRa code or some C code is acceptable.p  hr  pcodeknitrcode uses the codeevaluatecode package to evaluate R code chunks, and capture results, including plots. Briefly speaking, codeevaluatecode calls coderecordPlotcode to record a snapshot of the current plot after each code expression has been evaluated, and also when the plotting hooks like codebefore.plot.newcode and codebefore.grid.newpagecode are called normally this happens before a new plot is drawn. For those Lukes, please a hrefhttpsgithub.comhadleyevaluateblobmasterRgraphics.r relnofollowuse the sourcea if this is not clear enough.p  pAfter we make a snapshot, we need to decide whether to keep it, because the snapshot might not be changed after we evaluate a new expression, which is not involved with plotting. Now here comes my problem when a plot contains subplots for example, codepairscode, codecoplotcode, or codeparmfrow  c2, 3code in base R graphics, we should not keep the incomplete snapshots. In the example below, the first three plots should be discardedp  precodeparmfrow  c2, 2 plotrnorm10 plotrnorm10 plotrnorm10 plotrnorm10 codepre  pTo achieve this, we compare codeparmfg[12]code to codeparmfg[34]code as you can see in the source code, and this works well in some cases, but not all, for example, the a hrefhttpsgithub.comhadleyevaluateissues25 relnofollowissue 25ap  precodelayoutmatrixc1,3,2,3, 2 plotrnorm10 plotrnorm10 plotrnorm10 codepre  pNow how do I know the plot is not complete before line 4 The codemfgcode trick no longer works.p  pI have been looking for an answer to this problem for a long time, and I will truly appreciate it if someone can give me a hint further details are in the two links above, and I can clarify if anything is unclear. I believe there must exist a solution, because all R devices know when to start a new plot screen or file, and incomplete plots will not trigger new plot screens or files.p

Negative 444 pI have an ASP.Net application with a dropdownlist and an Ajax ComboBox. I need to enabledisable the ComboBox depending on the item chosen in the dropdownlist. Ive tried this both using clientside javascript and C server side code. Ive tried this in javascript to enable the ComboBox, using the onchange eventp  precodevar IMEI  findltcbIMEI.ClientID gt IMEI.element.disabled  false IMEI.element.isContentEditable  true IMEI.element.isDisabled  false codepre  pNone of these methods enabled the ComboBox. Ive also tried this on the server side, using the OnSelectedIndexChanged eventp  precodecbIMEI.Enabled  enabled codepre  pThis works, sort of.

When I walk through the code in the debugger, it tells me the ComboBox is enabled after the first value change, but it remains grayed out and cant be clicked on until I change the value again.

altProject Structurep  pWell. I didnt find a solution, but annotations helped me.p
Negative 444 pIm trying to achieve the following img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFcf74.png alt4 and 3.5 inch screens without scrollviewp  pThe red view is a fixed height, pinned to the top of the screen. The blue view is a fixed height, pinned to the bottom of the screen. The green view has no defined height, and should expandcontract based on the available room the width can stay the same.p  pThis works great on 3.5 inch and 4 inch screens, until I add a UIScrollView into the mix. Once I add a UIScrollView, the green view will always keep its 4 inch screen size height, rather than contracting on 3.5 inch screens.p  pIt ends up looking like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.come7geL.png alt3.5 inch screen with scrollviewp  pI understand that UIScrollViews are treated differently in AutoLayout in order to allow scrolling, but what I cant figure out is how to use that to create the desired layout.p

Negative 444 pI would like to perform an animation on an image before switching to a new activity. I also want to make sure that the animation is fully completed before the new activity starts.

Negative 444 pAlright, so I am trying to port a parallax website to Wordpress and it has given me nothing but headaches so far. Now I finally have it all working on desktop browsers but on mobile browsers it is producing all sorts of issues. If someone could tell me how to disable this part of my scriptwhich uses Stellar and iScroll from displaying on mobile browsers, or better yet, maybe you see why I am having so many issues. Either way I would be extremely grateful for some advice since jQueryJavascript is pretty foreign to me.

Negative 444 pI am looking for a design pattern of  what I call  matrix inheritance. To better explain the problem Ill describe an example.p  pGiven I want to model linux system packages in a general way. I have a base class named codePackagecode and its derivatives like codeApache2code, codePHP5code, etc. Now these classes contain all the methods to ensure this packages are installed and configured the way I want to them to be. But these classes should be usable on several different operating systems like Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, other Linux distributions and if possible Windows.p  pIt seems to me like this could be solved with some kind of a inheritance matrix where the effective class is inherited including mixins from the base package class to provide foundational methods and mixins to extend andor override methods from additional classesmodulesinterfacesprotocols to eventually provide the functionality for an automated installation on the specific system used to mixin.p  pI am trying to build this in ruby, but what I am more interested in is the general design pattern to apply to the system to realize this.p  pAlso I am sure that there is already an existing design pattern or a combination of those to get what I want, I just cant seem to find clean solution to this problem on my own.p  pAs an added bonus or even alternative I am wondering if the problem is probably easier to solve using a functional point of view instead of an object oriented approach and how this would look like.p

Negative 444 pIm in the process of learning how an operating system work, starting with Linux on Raspberry Pi. Currently, Im writing a program that uses pthread to create multiple threads and communicate with each other. In this program, there will be 2 threads 3 if you count main, 1 is writing and the other is reading, both threads uses a common struct to read and write and mutexes to signal each other by checking for locks, lock and unlocking. p  pTo check for thread communication, heres what I do The writing thread will read from a file called randStrings.txt, count number of e and total characters of each lines then put those 2 numbers in a common struct.p  pThe reading thread will write to a file called resultStrings.txt, reading from the common struct then write the number of e if e count is  0 or otherwise, write  for the total length of that line.p  pSo far, my thread can talk to each other, however, I can not do pthreadjoin to go back and forth between 2 threads.p  pHeres my codep

By using pointers where I dont need it, they messed my results.p  pNow I found another problem, while jumping back and forth between 2 threads with pthreadjoin , it can only jump once. The reading thread is done processing data from writing thread and writing thread still have more data to send but it can never call reading thread again to do that. Is there a way I can go back and forth between 2 threads Maybe theres a simplier way to do this without pthreadjoinp  pAlso, how do I stop the program after 2 threads finished their work Right now, I have to put an infinite loop in main to keep them running without destroying all the mutexes before the threads finished but theres no way to stop them except CTRL  C.p

I also have SQL Service reporting running on the same server, generating user reports.p  pSo my server basically works on top of disk readwrite speed.

But thats not the best solution.p  pAll replication mechanismtransaction, merge, snapshot affect publisher database by locking its table, what is unacceptable for me.p  pSo I wonder is there any possibility to create a replica with read only access, that would be synced periodically not affecting main db I would put all report load to that replica and make my primary db be used only by web app.p  pWhat solution might suit my problem As Im not a DBA, Id start investigating that direction.

Negative 444 pthis is not actually a programming questions tho. I was just wondering what the safe number of rows to select in a single query from a database is.p  pCurrently, in our companys app, its coded to select 300 rows and then split it into pages. It scalesspeed and performance well on the server, however, the number of additions to the database is really growing fast actually per day.p  pSo in a situation that we have over 5,000 customer feedback filed per week, i want to know the safe limit i could increase the codeselect querycode to. also without affecting speedperformance  for the nonIT staff..p  pThanks.p

Negative 444 pI am building an android app that uses webviews from an existing mobile web app. The existing mobile web app has a header graphic and also a footer navigation that uses unordered lists.p  pSince the android app has native navigation and a header already built into the app, when using a webview of the pages in the mobile web app, the web app header and footer are redundant in the android app. Since the mobile web app will be used for devices such as blackberrys and windows phones, I cannot universally remove the header and footer. Also, the web app header uses some CSS so I need to make sure thats in there for the mobile web app.p  pSo what I decided to try was use javascript to detect the android OS, dynamically assign a class name to the header and footer divs when it detects the android OS, and reference the class name in CSS to not display these divs. If the OS is not android then it will create the style pointer to the CSS file that is needed for the header in the mobile web app.p  pI am not a javascript or CSS expert, so I came up with a simple test to make sure this all works. Everything works except it does not seem to be assigning the class name to the div for it to be not displayed when the android OS is detected. I know its detecting the android OS because I have an alert in the if statement and that works. I cannot figure out where I am going wrong. I tested this on a Google Nexus 7 using android 4.4 and Chrome, and on a Motorola RAZR Droid with android 4.1.2 using Chrome.p  pThe test code is belowp  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN    httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetUTF8 gt  ltstylegt .android      displaynone  ltstylegt  ltscript languagejavascript typetextjavascriptgt  var isMobile       Android function          return navigator.userAgent.matchAndroidi        var divID  test  var newClassName  android  function changeClass   var divReference  document.getElementByIddivID  divReference.className  newClassName    if isMobile.Android                alertandroid         changeClass   else      alertNot android     document.writeltlink relstylesheet hrefheader.css typetextcssgt   ltscriptgt      lttitlegtUntitled Documentlttitlegt ltheadgt  ltbodygt lth1gtDetect android device and hide second UL list below.

Negative 444 pIm using LokiFunctor for callback purposes and I wish to share a functor object with a suitable codeoperatorcode member function defined between two callbacks. This functor needs to hold state so that both callbacks see it.p  pA quick test shows that constructing the Loki functor with a functor passed by value has a different result as to using the member function pointer constructorp  precodeinclude lokiFunctor.h  struct Bar    int x   void inc  x    int operator  return x    int get  return x    Bar b LokiFunctorltint, LokiNullTypegt f1b LokiFunctorltint, LokiNullTypegt f2ampb, ampBarget LokiFunctorltint, LokiNullTypegt f3ampb, ampBaroperator cout ltlt f1 ltlt endl    prints 0 cout ltlt f2 ltlt endl    prints 0 cout ltlt f3 ltlt endl    prints 0 b.inc cout ltlt f1 ltlt endl    prints 0 cout ltlt f2 ltlt endl    prints 1 cout ltlt f3 ltlt endl    prints 1 codepre  pcodef2code demonstrates that using member function pointers and a pointer to an instance results in different behaviour to codef1code. Then codef3code suggests itself as a possible way to share the functor between loki functors.p  pI believe codef1code relates to the copy semantics supported by LokiFunctor  a copy of the functor is made, which has a new value for codexcode, whereas codef2code and codef3code do what I want  the actual instance is referenced by the loki Functor and therefore shared between them.p  pTherefore Id like to know if codef3code is the best way to bind the same actual instance of the functor codeBarcode to two loki functors codef2code amp codef3code, or is there a bettercleaner way to do it along the lines of codef1code syntaxp  pEDIT some might ask why am I using Loki given its age It provides what I need in a constrained development environment, where global statics are strictly prohibited I did have to remove the Small Object singleton from lokiFunctor.h however, but that was easy. Happy to elaborate on the constraints if anyone has suggestions for alternative generalised functor libraries.p

I gather this is because I must be calling delete from a QuerySet, but I have been over my code with a finetoothed comb and there is precisely one occasion where I call delete on any alliance instance, and its not over a QuerySet.p  pIs there a way to track down what is causing this, or to find out what function has executed the delete of an objectp

On the Tablet the app should be able to use the integrated Camera of the tablet.p  pNormaly i do those things with Android which is pretty easy, but i have no idea about how to do those things on a Windows machine i am not used to MFC, etc.p  pTo make this clearp  pi do not needwant to fully integrate the Camera into the app It would be sufficient if i click a Button in my GUI that launches the default Camera app. And if possible returns the imagevideo recorded to the app.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pas stated in the comment below some clarification about the return an imagevideo taken by the camerap  pthe goal is to click on a button in the app that launches the system default camera app i know how to launch systemdefaultprogramms in windows using Java but i have no clue how windows 8 callshandles camera apps like android does. with that app the user takes 0  X fotos  videos and after he terminates the camera app those images andor video files should be recognizedreceived by the Java app.p  pi hope this makes it a little bit more clear.p

Negative 444 pSo Im dealing with a revoked ssl certificate issue.  I have a page that includes a script that points to an https location.  The page itself is for examplep  pcodehttpswww.mysite.comsomePage.htmlcodep  pOn the page I have the followingp  pcodeltscript typetextjavascript srchttpswww.othersite.comscript.jsgtltscriptgtcodep  pSo the ssl cert for codewww.othersite.comcode was revoked. Ive done research on how to deal with that, and thats not really the question I have.  p  pMy question has to do with accessing the codehttpswww.mysite.comsomePage.htmlcode itself, with a script on the page pointing to a revoked ssl certificate. p  pNow, I know that if the page itself was attempting to use a revoked certificate, the browser assuming it performed a check would not allow me to even go to the page. But if it was just an expired ssl cert then it would give me the option to ignore it and proceed anyway. p  pSo what about if the page itself has a valid ssl cert but the script on the page is using a revoked ssl cert  Will the browser simply load the page but not the script Will it give me some kind of mixed content type warning  Or will it not allow me to view the page at all, same as if the actual page were using a revoked ssl certp  pBasically Im concerned that because the script on the page currently has a revoked ssl cert, that some people might not even be able to view the page at all..p

Negative 444 pJust to preface, before I decided to ask this question, I have searched up and down StackOverflow.p  pThe problem I am having is wrt to deleting subdirectories in an ASP.NET web application and it causing an application pool restart. p  pThe folder that we upload files into, as well as deletecreate subdirectories in, is off the root of the application and setup as a virtual directory in IIS.p  pA zip can be uploaded the contains html and images. We show a preview of the html as well as the images. p  pThe user can reupload another zip. When this happens, we delete the previous temporary folder, and then create another temporary folder to hold the contents of the zip and render another preview. p  pIts during the deletion of the previous folder that we see an app restart. The snippet of the log output isp  precode20140210 160645,240 [16] globalasax  ApplicationEnd CONFIG change HostingEnvironment initiated shutdown HostingEnvironment caused shutdown    at System.Environment.GetStackTraceException e, Boolean needFileInfo codepre  pWeve had this setup from when our application used to run under ASP.NET 2.0 and this was the recommended setup to avoid application pool restarts and creatingdeleting directories.  p  pWeve recently upgraded our web application to ASP.NET 4.5 and we are seeing this behavior in our development environment.p  pBased on this post, a hrefhttpconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails646824aspnetapplicationrestartignorefoldersetting relnofollowhttpconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails646824aspnetapplicationrestartignorefoldersettinga, which says that ASP.NET 4 has relaxed on the monitoring for directory changes when the folders are under the web root as well as this post, a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combtessarchive20060802aspnetcasestudylostsessionvariablesandappdomainrecycles.aspx relnofollowhttpblogs.msdn.combtessarchive20060802aspnetcasestudylostsessionvariablesandappdomainrecycles.aspxa, which states that a change to the physical structure of a virtual directory can cause an application pool restart. Ive moved the folders back under the web root but I am still seeing the behavior. p  pWhats interesting is that if we comment out the piece of code that creates the preview An iFrame that renders the html which will reference any images uploaded with the zip to its temporary location i.e. domain.comtemp2imagesheader.gif. The deletion happens with no application restart.p  pAny help, or advice of where to look next would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 444 pI have a theoretical question for you . In the book Ive been learning C from although its great, its only in my native language so the title wont specify anything the author did a comparison between codedefinecode and codeconstcode variables. He was for the second method as it is better for debugging, but one thing that he didnt talk about at all is memory management. Say we have a big amount of constants we wish to define. Of course it can take a lot of memory. To be honest I am still learning and I have never had a need for so many constants, but when I learnt you can for example choose between codeshortcode, codeintcode and codelongcode, I started thinking that maybe those few bits make a difference in big programs. So my question is what do you think about thatp
Negative 444 pIm rewriting an app with the Google Maps iOS SDK and i want to reproduce the parallax effect. I have my GMSMapView in a UITableViewCell and I did my parallax effect, but in the older versions with MapKit ive used a MapView as big as my tableview. With GMS i cant do that because, with this method, the Google logo is not yet visible and I think that google in this case can block my api key. If i use a MapView as big as my cell and i update my camera in function of the scrolling, the effect is not good because of rendering. p  pMy question is How i can do a good parallax effect with GMS, showing the Google logo Is there a way to move the Google logop  pThanks in advancep

Negative 444 pSo the question isp  ul liHow to optimize function entry amp exit code in a portable way for speed using GCC, plain Cli ul  pI am interested in relevant options etc. My goal is writing a CPU emulator where the instruction set is decoded using call tables. I already eliminated any function call I could reasonably eliminate, but due to the structure of the instruction set, doing 23 such calls per emulated instruction is necessary so I can neither eliminate any more branch mispredictions here, either.p  pBased on analysing the assembly x86, 32bits output the option codefomitframepointercode seems worthwhile once I dont care for the lost debugability here. Otherwise in general if I look over the complete emulator it seems like it could be better with better overall register and stack management dont saving every single thing on every entry, my impression of the generated assembly is that it tampers more with the stack than how much useful work it does.p  pSo the situation is basically that there is a whole lot of little functions which are called manymany times, and which can not be eliminated from the code.p  pI dont want to switch over from the interpreting emulation since this should be the most portable approach to do this thing more portable anyway than any solution which would recompile.p

Negative 444 pFirst off, I know how to do a typical POST to Google with an access token such asp  precode.posthttpsaccounts.google.comooauth2token,              refreshtoken localStorage.refreshtoken,             clientid myclientid,             granttype refreshtoken         .done....fail... codepre  pHowever, now Im trying to insert a row into a Google spreadsheet.  There are two scenarios here.p  ol liUser clicks Log in with Google and authenticates with Google credentials.  My app then sends a POST request to insert a row into a spreadsheet on their Google Drive. This currently works no problem i.e. the row IS inserted into the spreadsheet.li liInstead of having the user authenticate, I obtain an access token for their account using a refresh token stored on a server.  I then execute the exact same POST request as in 1 but it fails silently.li ol  pSo it seems as if the first scenario is doing some configuration behind the scenes that I am not replicating in 2.  The documentation on the SpreadSheet API said I need to set an authorization header in order to submit this row to the spreadsheet.  I dont know how to do that I wish the docs gave an example there, but it looks like I can manually set headers using the codebeforeSendcode setting in jQuerys codeajaxcode method.  To submit to the spreadsheet the codecontentTypecode of the request must be codeapplicationatomxmlcode which means I need to use code.ajaxcode instead of the easier code.postcode I think.p  pTo be clear, everything works great when I go through the official login process to obtain an access token which I currently dont use in the request.  But it does not work in the second scenario. p  pI traced a similar POST request using Postman and looked at the headers and cookies to see if there was any authorization header, but I didnt see it.  Ive looked at a lot of information over a day now and havent been able to figure out what exactly I need to do.p  pThe request is made from a PhoneGap Android app if that matters.p  pHow can I set a header to the correct credentialsp  pHeres my codep  precodefunction postRowFromDatabaseToGoogleSpreadsheetrow  var spreadsheetApiUrl  httpsspreadsheets.google.comfeedslistmyspreadsheetkey1privatefull  var xml  ltentry xmlnshttpwww.w3.org2005Atom           xmlnsgsxhttpschemas.google.comspreadsheets2006extendedgt          ltgsx0gt1ltgsx0gt.formatid, row.id          ltgsx0gt1ltgsx0gt.formatcoverage, row.coverage          ltgsx0gt1ltgsx0gt.formatdate, row.date          ltgsx0gt1ltgsx0gt.formattime, row.time          ltgsx0gt1ltgsx0gt.formatcomments, row.comments          ltgsx0gt1ltgsx0gt.formatkwhr, row.kwhr          ltgsx0gt1ltgsx0gt.formatmlwater, row.mlwater          ltgsx0gt1ltgsx0gt.formattabletid, row.tabletid          ltentrygt  console.logSubmitting to URI   spreadsheetApiUrl console.logXml to submit n  xml  .ajax     type POST,     headers      beforeSend functionxhr          console.logbeforeSend         console.logxhr          xhr.donefunction              console.logxhr.responseText             console.logxhr.getAllResponseHeaders         .failfunction              console.logxhr failed...              ,     url spreadsheetApiUrl,     data xml,     contentType applicationatomxml,     crossDomain true  .donefunctionresponse      console.logpost succeeded     if response  null          console.logresponse was null      else          console.logresponse      .failfunctionerror      console.logpost failed     console.logerror .alwaysfunction      console.logpost completed   codepre

Negative 444 pI asked a question about cloning in java and got answers saying deep copy creates a new instance of the object carrying the same state and data in the member variables. I was told shallow copying is just assigning an object reference to another reference variable. But thats NOT copying thats assignment making a new pointer for the object location. p  pWhat is deep copying of objects then really if there are reference variables contained within the object you are trying to clone Would using codemyObj2  myObj.clonecode clone all components within the object Lets say if myObj contained other reference variables pointing to other object locations, would those reference variables also be cloned So myObj2s internal reference variables would not be pointing to the same old object locations that pointers in myObj where pointing to.. I need clarity here to fully understand what cloning is all about.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 444 pi wrote a form in primefaces, where I want to show and change my data in my database. Now I want to make it, that the user could change the data in frontend, and could make it undo, if he reload the page. On this page should be a save button, and only if this button was pushed, the data should be saved in database.p  pCurrently I got the problem, if I run the onSave Method, I cant see the variables of my previous function onEdit. So I wrote only the wrong data into database.p  pEditObject.javap  precodeManagedBean public class EditObjects implements Serializable                        private static final long serialVersionUID

Negative 444 pIm trying to teach myself a concept by writing a script.  Basically, Im trying to write a Python script that, given a few strongkeywordsstrong, will crawl web pages until it finds the data I need.  For example, say I want to find a list of venemous snakes that live in the US.  I might run my script with the keywords codelist,venemous,snakes,UScode, and I want to be able to trust with at least 80 certainty that it will return a list of snakes in the US.p  pI already know how to implement the web spider part, I just want to learn how I can determine a web pages relevancy without knowing a single thing about the pages structure.  I have researched web scraping techniques but they all seem to assume knowledge of the pages html tag structure.  Is there a certain algorithm out there that would allow me to pull data from the page and determine its relevancyp  pAny pointers would be greatly appreciated.  I am using codePythoncode with codeurllibcode and codeBeautifulSoupcode.p

Negative 444 pOk, so Im creating a website that will let users upload csvfiles that are to be scanned in to a mySQLdatabse. Because I dont want to risk evil people uploading strange files that can mess with my database Im guessing its a good idea to check the mime type of the file.

The following code in my uploadfile.php just prints out the temporary file name followed by hello.p  precodefilename  FILES[file][tempname] echo filename  if functionexistsfinfoopenampampmode0  finfo  finfoopenFILEINFOMIMETYPE  echo finfofilefinfo,filename finfoclosefinfo  echo hello  codepre  pSo I know that the file has uploaded correctly, I know the function exists, I know that there is no error throughout the if clause. So then why wont it work Im testing this through MAMP, and am thinking that maybe there is some error there Though it has PHP Version 5.4.4.p  pI have also tried different versions likep  precodemimetype  finfofilefinfo,filename  echo mimetype codepre  pBut nothing works. It never prints any mime type  What can I do to fix thisp

Negative 444 pEveryonep  pI implemented a custom aggregate pig UDF. The UDF implements the Algebraic interface, and there are 3 classes  Initial, Intermed and Final to do work at the different phases. It works correctly, but somewhat inefficiently.p  pThe UDF uses an algorithm which is a bit heavy  especially when running on a single value. It will work much more efficiently when running on bigger groups of data  say  100 at a time. What I observed is that the Initial class is always invoked with a single value, and later combined with the Intermed and Final classes.p  pI am aware the that theres the Accumulator interface for such cases, but I could not find documentation on how to use it with an Algebraic UDF.p  pSo my question is  is there a way for me to force pig to pass more values to the Initial calculation  either using the Accumulator interface or via some other way.p  pAn explanantion or a pointer to documentation or a sample would be much appreciated.p  pThanks Amirp

Negative 444 pI cant find any satisfactory solution for the problems which I sometimes meet. For example we have Article, Photo and Comment entities, I want to make Article and Photo commentable. So, there are same approaches br br   1. For all entities like Article, Photo make specific enitity like CommentPhoto, CommentArticle. But it makes me crazy when I duplicate the same code... br   2. Use mappedSuperClass. But it forces me to extends class like Article  the problem occurs, when i want make Articles for example likeable and I cant do that because i can extend only one class. There are traits which would be helpful but they are available since php5.4.0. br   3. So i want to use interface Commentable and implement it entities. Then i want to Create entity with relation to this interface. I know there is something like resolve target entities a hrefhttpsymfony.comdocmastercookbookdoctrineresolvetargetentity.html relnofollowhttpsymfony.comdocmastercookbookdoctrineresolvetargetentity.htmla it allows to configure relationship with interface but this configuration is static Correct me if I am wrong  maybe I could configure in config.yml more than one entity for the same interface   br br  So my question is Is there any other approach Or how to use resolve target entities to achieve thisp  pEdit 4. fourth approach is to add fields entitytype, entityid to Comment, but it is still not clear as I dreamt...p

Negative 444 pIm trying to create a require.js plugin to load GLSL Shader files, construct a Shader Program, and return it to the module that is using the files as dependencies.  However, Im wondering if Im asking my plugin to do something that is both possible and wise in terms of things it should be concerned about.p  pRight now, I have written the module following the guidelines on require.js plugin page taking a cue from the codetextcode and codei18ncode plugins.  Those modules have slightly different goals in terms of what they need to accomplish though.  codetextcode returns file text, which was simple enough to get going.  codei18ncode returns an object of localized strings depending on a locale.  Again, somewhat in line with what I want.  However, neither one of those care about what the DOM is doing whenever they run.p  pIn order to get my module working, I need a handle to a codeltcanvasgtcode element or a WebGL context created from that canvas.  For brevity, lets consider the context codeglcode.p  pOnce I have loaded up the shader source files, I need to use functions within codeglcode to put them into the context, compile them, link them, and produce a program to keep track of.  If I have codeglcode, there is no issue.  Looking at some of the templating plugins for require.js, I see that they sometimes just create a temporary DOM element, do what they need to do, and return whatever they manufactured using the element.  p  pThis would almost solve my problem except that I dont believe context resources can be shared between one another.  That is to say, if I added a codeltcanvasgtcode from within the plugin, got the context, and created the shader, I wouldnt be able to utilize that Shader Program from within the context that I strongactuallystrong want to use it in.p  pIs there a way to have require.js provide the codeglcode to my plugin in a convenient way perhaps through the dependencies  If not, am I asking too much of my plugin and instead should focus on only loading shader source within it and delegating the actual Program construction to another modulep  h2glsl.jsh2  precodefunction        Parser to grab the shaders to use     function parsename          var components               vert  name.matchv.[1],             frag  name.matchf.[1],                  return components            fetchText helper from requirejstext     function fetchTexturl, callback          var xhr  new XMLHttpRequest         xhr.openGET, url, true         xhr.onreadystatechange  functionevt              if xhr.readyState  4                  callbackxhr.responseText                               xhr.sendnull            Construct a Shader Program from components     function Programgl, vert, frag                     Problem is that I dont know how to effectively get gl defined here                     Check for validity         function checkShadershader              if gl.getShaderParametershader, gl.COMPILESTATUS                  console.logAll good                          else                  console.logError compiling shader s, gl.getShaderInfoLogshader                                var vShader  gl.createShadergl.VERTEXSHADER         var fShader  gl.createShadergl.FRAGMENTSHADER          gl.shaderSourcevShader, vert         gl.shaderSourcefShader, frag          gl.compileShadervShader         gl.compileShaderfShader          checkShadervShader         checkShaderfShader                 Define our GLSL module     define          Make files module relative         normalize  functionname, normalize               Get componenets             var parsed  parsename               Normalize             parsed.vert  normalizeparsed.vert             parsed.frag  normalizeparsed.frag               Return normalized value             return v  parsed.vert  f  parsed.frag         ,           Do the loading of the Shader         load  functionname, req, onload, config                Predefine variables             var components  null, vertPromise  null, fragPromise  null               Parse the components             components  parsename,               Make Vertex Promise             vertPromise  new Promisefunctionresolve, reject                  fetchTextreq.toUrlcomponents.vert  .vert, functiontext                      resolvetext                              ,               Make Fragment Promise             fragPromise  new Promisefunctionresolve, reject                  fetchTextreq.toUrlcomponents.frag  .frag, functiontext                      resolvetext                                             Wait for XHR to resolve             Promise.all[                     vertPromise,                     fragPromise             ].thenfunctionvalues                   Done loading them                   Construct a new shader program from values                 var shaderProgram  new Programgl, values[0], values[1]                   Deliver the shader program                 onloadshaderProgram                             codepre  h2app.jsh2  precoderequirejs.config     baseUrl  js,     paths           domReady  libdomReadydomReady,         glsl  moduleglslglsl        require[         domReady,         glslv..resshaderf..resshader ], functiondomReady, fragShader      domReadyfunction           Predefine Variables         var c  null, gl  null           Get reference to our canvas         c  document.getElementByIdtestCanvas           Get an OpenGL Context         gl  c.getContextexperimentalwebgl                     I should have a constructed and compiled shader here referenced by           fragShader                     Doesnt work yet         gl.useProgramfragShader        codepre

I can perform a codefindcode for the elementp  precode console.logdata.find.schedule  codepre  pbut when I view the output of this the codecontextcode is undefined.p  pI also tried the accepted answer in this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2137811extractpartofhtmldocumentinjqueryExtract part of HTML document in jQuerya with no availp  precode var foo  .schedule, data  console.logfoo codepre  pThis still has an undefined codecontextcode.p  pIdeally, I want to grab just the information in code.sectioncode and replacing the current in code.sectioncode with the information captured from the GET request. code.sectioncode is part of the codedocumentcode as well as what is returned from the request.p  pThere are no errors in the console. jQuery version is 1.11.1.p  pMy apologies if the question is poorly written. I tried to write it in a general way so it may apply to other people too. Let me know if you need additional information. p

Negative 444 pI have two usercontrols a LocationTreeView, and a LocationPicker. The LocationTreeView organizes Locations into a tree structure.

Negative 444 pIn a different a hrefhttpmath.stackexchange.comq901222StackExchangea, the following algorithm based on arithmetic coding was presented as an efficient method for generating outcomes of a 7sided die, when all that is given is a 6sided diep  precodeint rand7    static double a0, width7   persistent state    while intawidth  inta        width  6     a  rand61width       int n  inta   a  n    a  7 width  7   return n1  codepre  pNot being a true mathematician, Ill do the best I can to explain how this algorithm works p  pAt the start of each call to coderand7code, codewidthcode is the ratio 7supssup6suptsup, and codeacode is a nonnegative value with the property that codea  widthcode lies in the interval [0, 7 after the base case. When entering the codewhilecode loop, codewidthcode is the maximal value that can be added to codeacode. If codefloora  widthcode is different from codeflooracode, then a random choice of  0, codewidthcode16, codewidthcode13, codewidthcode12, codewidthcode23, codewidthcode56  is added to codeacode, and the exponent codetcode is incremented by one reducing the value of codewidthcode by a power of 6. Note that after an iteration, the property that codea  widthcode lies in the interval [0, 7 remains invariant. When codewidthcode becomes smaller than the difference of codeceila  acode, the iterations stop. The loop adds more entropy into codeacode so long as doing so can actually affect the outcome of the die roll, and intuitively, emthis is building a random real number in the range of [0, 7 using base 6em. After leaving the loop, the die roll is taken to be codefloora  1code, and codeacode is reduced to its fractional part. At that point codea  widthcode lies in the interval [0, 1. To prepare for the next call and to maintain the invariant property, both codeacode and codewidthcode are scaled up by a factor of 7 for codewidthcode, this increases the exponent codescode by 1.p  pThe above explains the workings of the inductive step. Analysis of the base case is left as an exercise for the interested reader.p  pOf course, from an efficiency standpoint, the use of floatingpoint arithmetic immediately pops out as a performance drag assuming the performance of coderand6code is already sufficient and itself cannot be improved. While maintaining this arithmetic coding algorithm, what is the best approach to removing the use of floatingpointp

Negative 444 pIm looking at Apple documentation for UIPushBehavior and it confuses me in instantaneous mode. I know that the acceleration formula is strongForce  Mass  accelerationstrong. I assume that mass of a view is widthheightdensity1. The documentation describes push magnitude as followsp  blockquote   pThe default magnitude is nil, equivalent to no force. A continuous   force vector with a magnitude of 1.0, applied to a 100 point x 100   point view whose density value is 1.0, results in view acceleration of   100 points  second in the direction indicated by the angle or   pushDirection property.p blockquote  pThis makes sense in terms of continuous pushing, where it provides constant acceleration. It does not say anything about intantaneous push. strongHow can I understand what velocity an instantaneous push of magnitude 1 will provide to a 100x100 viewstrongp

Negative 444 pOne user has a problem with one of my apps after the latest upgrade. She says the app will not open. It sounds like she sees the Default launch screen for a second and then it disappears i.e. it crashes when trying to run app code. Also, she says when she double taps the Home button to see the apps currently running, she sees my app, with the normal type of screen i.e. a table with a few entries which was created with the version prior to the upgrade. She has tried powering off and on. Can anyone offer any suggestions on what might be happening. No other user has reported the same problem. It may be that she could remove the app and reinstall, but then she would lose all of her data which would be bad. Is there any way of reinstalling without removing from the iPhonep  pEDIT I just got a little more information from the user. As I said before, after the crash, when she presses the Home button twice to see running apps, she sees my app, with a few entries in the opening screen table. What is interesting, for the upgrade, I changed the order of the entries. I also added a tool bar with 2 buttons. She sent me a screen shot and what she is getting is the screen you would expect when running the old version i.e. the table ordered in the old way, and no toolbar. I dont know if this just means my app started to run and crashed before reordering the table and adding the toolbar, or if the installation got corrupted so she is not really running the new application properly. Does that sound feasible Would there be any way to reinstall the app without removing it and its data firstp

Negative 444 pIm writing an effect filter for Android devices, which has twodimension loops in the fragment shader. For most of the devices, the shader can be compiled and run in reasonable time, but some of the devices takes several minutes to compile the shader at the first time.p  pMy fragment shader has a heavy twodimension kernel convolutionp  precodeconst lowp int KERNELRADIUS  19  ....  for int y  KERNELRADIUS y lt KERNELRADIUS y      for int x  KERNELRADIUS x lt KERNELRADIUS x              ....       codepre  pIn fact it is a 39x39 loop, and it cannot be split into two passes of onedimension filter due to the kernel design. The kernel weights are stored as another input texture of the shader for lookup. Obviously this shader cannot have reasonable performance when directly applied to an image with normal size 800x600  1600x1200, so I resize the image to 200x200  400x400 and then I can have realtime response on most devices.p  pI know that some shader compiler cannot accept such a large loop and will fail to compile the program. I have found some devices with this behavior. The compile time is still reasonable on the device. It just reports a failure and let me disable the effect filter. However, on some other devices, the compilation is successful and the program can be used normally, but the first time of compilation is about 23 minutes. After that, the compiler caches the program and give a compile time of 50100 ms when I create the effect filter again.p  pCurrently I cannot modify my algorithm to remove or shrink the twodimension loops, but it is also hilarious if I let the user to wait minutes for the first launch. I want to disable the effect filter on those devices. The problem is that I use GLES20.glCompileShader to compile the shaderp  precodepublic static int loadShaderfinal String strSource, final int iType      int[] compiled  new int[1]     int iShader  GLES20.glCreateShaderiType     GLES20.glShaderSourceiShader, strSource     GLES20.glCompileShaderiShader     GLES20.glGetShaderiviShader, GLES20.GLCOMPILESTATUS, compiled, 0     if compiled[0]  0          Log.dLoad Shader Failed, Compilationn  GLES20.glGetShaderInfoLogiShader         return 0          return iShader  codepre  pIt is a blocking call. I need to wait several minutes before making the decision of disabling filter on such devices.p  pIs there a way to compile the shader codes asynchronously or in a limited duration For example, return fail in 5 seconds if the compliation does not complete yet.p  pIf glCompileShader can only be called synchronously, I want to force terminate the thread so it does not block the AP. But it will cause a serious problem. The thread which compiles the shader code is the same as the thread creating the OpenGL context. If I kill the thread while it is blocking, I cannot destroy the OpenGL context appropriately in the same thread.p  pIs it possible, or safe, to compile the shader codes in a different thread than the one which initializes the OpenGL context I was told that they should be the same thread, and I want to know if they are able to be different when I really need to do this.p
Negative 444 pSo I am creating a chrome extension that utilizes a background page and a content script. My background page acts like a state machine. When I want to run through some states, the background page receives the first state. It then injects the content script into the current tab via programmatic injection.p  pThe content script then does its business and returns an answer after a while to the background page. This all works right now. Here is where it gets difficult. p  pPart of the work of the content script could listening to a user clicking a link which is expected behavior. So when a user clicks a link, I capture that and send the info to the background page that the link has been clicked and tell it to move on to the next step. Sometimes, clicking a link could cause the page to reload and other times it could not. When the background page wants to move on to the next step, it doesnt know if the current tab has reloaded or not. p  pMy questions is, how do I perform the logic of inserting the next step. I could ping to see if I get a response and then if I dont inject the script but that didnt work when I tried it because if the new page hadnt loaded yet, the old page might respond. Therefore, the background page would think that the page wasnt reloading when really it is.p

the remaining part may have an image or text in the activity so that the user is able to see himself during the recording. The problem i faced was the camera is already being used for recording and hence it is locked, if anyone can suggest me a work around it would be a great help. Thank you.p

Negative 444 pI am very new to web development.  I am building a page using ASP.Net based on the Visual Studio 2013 template which incorporates bootstrap css.  The Site Master has the standard navbar setup incorprating the aspLogin control.  The navbar collapses when the screen resizes which I like .  I have added 2 images to the navbar.  One at the left end and one at the right end of the navbar.  The right hand image shows to the right of the LoginRegister menu options.  This is all working and displaying as I would like however when the window size is reduced below the collapse threshold and the navbar adjusts from being horizontal to a vertical menu, the image I have at the right hand end gets included in the dropdown vertical menu and appears above the LoginRegister options.

Negative 444 pI need to make a simple web scrapper to grab some basic info about the Athens Stock Exchange in real time. My weapon of choice is Node.js and more specifically the cheerio module.p  pThe info I want to grab is represented in the website as the text inside some  elements. These  elements are nested inside another one. An example is thisp  precodeltspan idtickerGeneralIndex classstyle3redgt   ltspan classpercentagedeltagt     0,50   ltspangt ltspangt codepre  pIn this case, the data I want to extract is 0,50.p  pThe code I have written is thisp  precodevar request  requirerequest,     cheerio  requirecheerio  requesthttpwww.euro2day.grAseRealTime.aspx, function error, response, html      if error ampamp response.statusCode  200          var   cheerio.loadhtml         var span  span.percentagedelta.text         console.logspan       codepre  pThis code does not produce the desired output.

This is correct, as I have asked to get the class of the element. Of course this is not what I wanted.

Negative 444 pI have an error, that is filling up my logs with 8 errors. The error reads Error    1   error C2664 NodeNodeconst Node amp  cannot convert argument 1 from CarPart  to stdstring I am not sure how to diagnose or fix this problem. Thanks ahead for the help. There is a lot of code for this project so I am just going to post what I have and let you folks read through it, let me know if I can sum it up a little easier. The error occurs in the driver when the new CarPart is invoked. Also I know that the printList function is incomplete in the driver and that is my next question, I am not sure how to get it to print the list with the information that I have fill out for my header and implementation. The driver was provided by the study text, I just need it to compile and execute.p  pHeaderp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltiomanipgt include ltstringgt include ltvectorgt include ltfstreamgt

But since the token work is done through Google Plus SDK, and they are using a delegate model for communicating the completion of the authentication request, I dont know how to hold the request to the web service until the token has been refreshed.p  pAt present Im trying out a pretty bad idea, which is shown below, where I attempt to put my request into a new thread and then put that thread to sleep for a while, at which point it wakes up and we hope that the new token is available.  But there has to be a better wayp  precode             if error nil ampamp error.code  NSURLErrorUserCancelledAuthentication               special handling of 401, which may be a Google Auth token failure.               if it is, then lets go get a new token.

Negative 444 pI have a strange issue when I am doing indexing in a numpy multidimensional array. So, I have an array of shape 4, 882. I have another array called matches of shape 276, 2.

Negative 444 pWasnt sure how to call my title, because Im not sure how to call that problem right now. I got codeone superclasscode and codethree subclassescode. The codesubclassescode only got an own codecunstructorcode, all other methods and attributes are listed in the codesuperclasscode. Now one of those three codesubclassescode have to contain a new attribute codedelaycode and a method for that. But if I implement a somewhat codegenericcode method because it doesnt care which subclass is using it, because it checks it in the method itself. but in the superclass in the method I want that if my object is of that specific subclass that it can access the delay.p  pAnyone can tell me how to achieve this without implementing the attribute into the superclass itself Only want that an object this subclass can access this delay attributep  precodeelse if this instanceof repairCar      ifthis.getDelay  0       codepre  pEditp  pThere is the superclass codeCarcodep  precodeThis contains methods like setSpeed and corresponding attributes  ant a method called drive. codepre  pnow there are the subclasses codeFastCarcode codeNormalCarcode codeRepairCarcode which all only got a constructor in the subclass.p  pThe RepairCar should have another attribute codedelaycode due to it being repaired right now.p  pIn the superclass in the codedrive methodcode it checks whether the Car is a codeFastCarcode, codeNormalCarcode or codeRepairCarcode. When it is a codeRepairCarcode it should check if the delay is 0 so It can drive otherwise it will wait a turn and lower the delay until its 0.p  pNow I want that only my RepairCar got this delay attribute and not my other two subclasses. But if my drive method is in the superclass it wont let me reference to the delay of a RepairCar due to the superclass not having this attribute.p  pAny way to implement the drive method for all 3 Cartypes in the Superclass without implementing the delay into the superclassp

Negative 444 pIm trying to integrate a third party hardware to one of my existing projects . Basically the hardware has two buttons with different color leds on each button. p  pI am able to open and close each led with the librarymanual which is provided by the manufacturer without any problem. My problem is I can not handle its buttons click events from any kind of software CCVB etc... p  pI mean when I press one of its buttons it acts like any input device and effects the cursors current position like a keyboard key or mouse click due the opened programFor example if Ms Word is opened currently it acts like space key. The DLL or manual has no special function for this purpose like a mouse click event. p  pSo what Im asking is there any general way to handle any external device button click inside a C program How the currently running software suppose to understand a button is clicked and enter the desired method in the code p  pAny clue or tip would be highly appreciated.p  pThanks...p

Negative 444 pI have an azurewebsite authenticated with Azure Active Directory, and my goal is to deploy to a staging slot, which is then promoted to the production environment. However when I deploy to the staging slot it is being treated as a separate application in my Azure AD. When I promote the environment the Reply URL in Azure AD application stays the same, so that my production site is now being redirected back to the staging slot after logging in. p  pIt would help if I could configure the application Reply URL in the app settings of the site, which can be configured on the azurewebsite environment itself. I have tried adding the idaRedirectURI to the app settings and it had no effect.p

Negative 444 pI am trying to set up a concurrent queue that will enqueue data objects coming in from one thread while another thread dequeues the data objects and processes them. I have used a codeBlockingCollectionltTgtcode and used the codeGetConsumingEnumerablecode method to create a solution that works pretty well in simple usage. My problem lies in the facts that  p  ol lithe data is coming in quickly, data items being enqueued approximately every code50mscode  li liprocessing each item will likely take significantly longer than 50ms  li liI must maintain the order of the data items while processing as some of the data items represent events that must be fired in the proper order.li ol  pOn my development machine, which is a pretty powerful setup, it seems the cutoff is about code60mscode of processing time for getting things to work right. Beyond that, I have problems either with having the queue grow continuously not dequeuing fast enough or having the data items processed in the wrong order depending on how I set up the processing with regard to whetherhow muchwhere I parallelize. Does anyone have any tipstrickssolutions or can point me to such that will help me herep  pEdit As pointed out below, my issue is most likely not with the queuing structure itself so much as it is with trying to dequeue and process the items faster. Are there tricktipsetc. for portioning out the processing work so that I can keep dequeuing quickly while still maintaining the order of the incoming data items.p  pEdit again Thanks for all your replies Its obvious I need to put some more work into this. This is all great input, though and I think it will help point me in the right direction I will reply again either with a solution that I came up with or a more detailed question and code sample Thanks again.p  pstrongUpdatestrong In the end, we went with a BlockingCollection backed by a ConcurrentQueue. The queue worked perfectly for what we wanted. In the end, as many mentioned, the key was making the processing side as fast and efficient as possible. There is really no way around that. We used parallelization where we found it helped in some cases it actually hurt performance, cached data in certain areas, and tried to avoid locking scenarios. We did manage to get something working that performs well enough that the processing side can keep up with the data updates. Thanks again to everyone who kicked in a responsep

Negative 444 pIve been creating a Sprite game in swift using the Sprite kit. Ive declared the project to be of type game. Ive created a folder an appended .atlas to the end of it. Ive added this folder to my project. The variables I create for an TextureAtlas work great however all the images appear blank inside the folder and the actual sprites have the white box with a red arrow inside. Ive seen many tutorials on how to fix this, and the final thing I have yet to do is enable the texture atlas in the build configurations. When following the apple documentation they say enter sprite inside of the search yet nothing appears.

Negative 444 pIm sure i remember a specific term for this situation.p  pLets say Mr SO is implementing some Flags. He has three kinds of flags New Zealand Flags, Senegalese Flags, and Moldovan Flags. All of these flags can be raised, waved, and turned into a cape. So naturally Mr SO begins to implement codeRaisecode, codeWavecode, and codeCapeifycode methods. Unfortunately he decides to implement each method in each flag, rather than have each flag inherit the methods.p  pWhat is the name of the mistake has Mr SO made Im sure there is a term for it but i cant for the life of me remember it.p

Negative 444 pA little bit of context. I have developped a webapp on node.js and a glamourous set of extensions. It has been approved for testing with true users at my company and i am supposed to deploy it now. Problem is that basically i have no idea unto how attack this problem. I have so many questions.p  pFor the moment i have created a virtual machine on the local server. I have installed ubuntu server unto it and i have the intuition about how to deploy the app in this part i suppose following the same steps as when i started to work on this project. I do not know however if i can have remote access from the outside of my network to this virtual machine. I also dont know if additional configuration in ubuntus side is needed to make such an idea work for example in the installation there was a part about proxies that at the moment i decided to ignorep  pFrom the few documents i have read about it since i was assigned this, a solution may lie in using nginx. The logic behind it if i am not mistaken and please correct me if i am is that nginx can help linking the HTTP requests through the port 80 which is normally opened for access in most machines and link it to a specific port on the machine The sexy app i have developped.p  pIn a more early stage, what ressources would i need to start this off Would i need a domain name IS it necessary Do i need a different virtual server to link the apps or can they be on the same machinep  pIf you have additional comments or tips for someone that is learning to do this kind of thing, please do.p

Negative 444 pIm trying to find the area in Firefox source where after the user hits enter, the words entered in the url bar are identified to be fed to default search engine.

Negative 444 pIve got a grid with 3 columns the first has its Width set to , which I have been led to believe will make it fill up any remaining space left by the other columns. The second has a width of 8, and the thirds Width is set to Auto so its size changes depending on its contents.p  pIn my 2nd column I have a GridSplitter, so that when dragged I can change the width of both the first and third columns. This works fine, the issue is that I have a grid in my third column that, when toggled, will have its visibility set to collapsed. When collapsed, I need the first column to fill all of the remaining space. I tried to do this many waysp  ul liSet Horizontal Alignment on first column to Stretchli liBound the Grid.Rowspan of the first column to the visibility of the third one, so that when when hidden the Rowspan will change to 3 and, since its width is using , it should theoretically use all of the available space in all 3 columns.li ul  pThe weird thing is that, if I do not resize the columns using the GridSplitter, then the first column will fill all remaining space properly. Yet after resizing, the first column will not budge. Its almost as if, when dragging the GridSplitter to resize the columns, WPF change the width of both columns to become absolute instead of their star and auto values, making it so they will not fill the space after a resize.p  pXAML Code condensed as requestedp  precodeltGrid Grid.Row1gt             ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt                 ltColumnDefinition Widthgt                 ltColumnDefinition WidthAutogt                 ltColumnDefinition WidthAutogt             ltGrid.ColumnDefinitionsgt     ltGrid xNameAssetListViewGrid Grid.Column0 Grid.RowSpanBinding Visibility, ElementNameAssetViewMetadataSplitter, ConverterStaticResource SplitterVisibilityToRowSpanConverter  Margin0 4 0 4gt     lt irrelevant code gt     ltGridgt ltGridSplitter xNameAssetViewMetadataSplitter Grid.Column1 Opacity0.8 HorizontalAlignmentCenter Width6 Margin3 5 1 5 ToolTipGrab to resize VisibilityBinding IsChecked, ElementNameGridHeaderVisibilityToggleButton, ConverterStaticResource VisConvertergt ltGrid xNameMetadataGrid Margin4 2 4 2 Grid.Column2 DataContextBinding MetadataViewModel VisibilityBinding IsChecked, ElementNameGridHeaderVisibilityToggleButton, ConverterStaticResource VisConvertergt     lt irrelevant code gt ltGridgt codepre  pp

Negative 444 pI am working on a web app following irlnathanponzicoders Sailscasts series as a guide.

At this stage in the tutorial precise time linked to, we see that the response page he receives is the JSON object of the User that was just created using the signup. I, however, get the following for my response pagep  precode   error EVALIDATION,   status 400,   summary 1 attribute is invalid,   model User,   invalidAttributes      encryptedPassword [                rule string,         message undefined should be a string instead of null, which is a object       ,                rule required,         message required validation rule failed for input null            ]     codepre  pThis states that my encryptedPassword parameter is somehow undefined by the time I am returning a response. However, when I log the json object I am returning to the response in my console, I get the following which is what I expect to see instead of the EVALIDATION responsep  precode firstName First,   lastName Last,   email emaildomain.com,   encryptedPassword 2a10q0TfKWnN47mucsZLybN8WeygPPMpYxp9VMGUgIjA.ipZBn.POuOG,   lastLoggedIn 20150803T234522.520Z,   gravatarUrl httpwww.gravatar.comavatar7328fddefd53de471baeb6e2b764f78a,   createdAt 20150803T234522.523Z,   updatedAt 20150803T234522.523Z,   id 39  codepre  pSo encryptedPassword is definitely being correctly created and defined.p  pThis is a problem similar to the one faced by stronga hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29404485sailscastsusermodelvalidationTHISastrong user, except my problem does not lie in missing HTML name attributes.
