Positive 1177 pI have a main activity in which i have used a view pager.So i can move between 4 tabs and the view pager handles all of that.One of my tabs scans the contacts on the phone to get their details and display it in the recylerview which is in the same tab,this task takes a long time and i am doing this in an async task.Everything is working fine but the problem is if i move to another tab while this scanning is going on the data does not get applied to the recycler view possible because that fragment is being destroyed. Is there a workaround for this or should i just prevent the user from shifting tabs while the scanning is going on if so some sort of code or a link to the code would be really helpfull.p

Positive 1177 pemSide note Ive been designing in wordpress for only a few months, and dont know where else or how else to ask this, so my language may seem somewhat inaccurate.emp  pIm using the Jupiter theme within Wordpress to create my site, which is essentially a textbook. One of the chapters has content Ive created with the tabs element on the Visual Composer frontend editor. However, the content needs to be formatted so that for each of 5 tabs, within each tab there are nested tabs. p  pApparently this function isnt allowed in Visual Composerdragging the tabs element within another tabs element, so I created class names for each tab and used javascript to append the tabs to be within the corresponding tab.

Positive 1177 pyet a new Eclipse Scout question from mep  pIn my Scout Application which is roughly based on the template Outline Tree and Table Form I managed to add new instances of a searchform with a click on a node. My forms display properties are configured like thisp  precode  Override   protected int getConfiguredDisplayHint  return DISPLAYHINTVIEW        Override   protected String getConfiguredDisplayViewId  return VIEWIDPAGEDETAIL  codepre  pIm not adding the forms to pages with the builtin methodse.g. setDetailFormIForm form, but I set them as a new attribute to the pages and start them via their FormHandler. In this way I achieve that the Scout renderer tabs the forms next to each other and this is exactly what I want. Adding them as forms to the page causes the renderer to close the other forms whenever a page is activated, so only one form is displayed at one time.p  pMy problems with this implementation arep  ol liReactivation of the tabs is only possible in the RAP client. For the RAP client it is enough to call the activate method of the form to reactivate and focus the corresponding tab.  On the other hand the SWT client which I depend on doesnt seem to care at all about the activate call and therefore does not reactivate the page. So Im searching for a safe and easy way to persuade the SWT renderer of    ol litabbing the forms next to each other preferably without the use of a Scout TabField. As described above, this is already working, but Im not sure if this is the recommended way.li lireactivate the tabs on a NodeClick as the RAP client already doesli olli liReceive events when clicking on the tab closing the tab Xbutton in SWT, no button in RAP ., or whatever. I think this question is bit broader as it is a general problem in Scout to step into productspecific processes which are not part of the abstract programming model of Scout. Nevertheless, it would be nice to process those event and others out of the global client without tweaking the specific rendering products.li ol  hr  pA screenshot of my programs UI to make things easier to follow a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.commw0Ed.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commw0Ed.png altScreenshot of the Scout applicationap  pIn the screenshot the fifth form is activated as a view and the corresponding node in the outline tree on the left is also marked. As you see, there are multiple forms added which all belong to a node in the outline tree.

Positive 1177 pI am working on an HTML page where there are a list of items in a table and on clicking an item a new tab is generated showing the details of the item clicked. I am using jqueryui tabs for dynamically creating tabs. I need to open a tab for an item only if a tab does not exist for that item. I use the below code to achieve thisp  precodeif selector.length      create new tab for the item  codepre  pI use tabs with unique id for each item. This code works when loading tab for the first time, the problem is I also have a X button to close the tab and on click f that button I remove the tab division from HTML DOM using jquery .remove function. This way the tab gets removed but when I try to add the tab for a particular item after removing it once. Then the above code doesnt work it shows that tab already exist. And new tab is not getting created. How can I remove an element completely from HTML DOM so that the above code works for recreating tabs after removing it once.

To be used with ViewPager to provide a tab indicator component which give constant feedback as to   the users scroll progress.   ltpgt   To use the component, simply add it to your view hierarchy. Then in your   link android.app.Activity or link android.support.v4.app.Fragment call   link setViewPagerandroid.support.v4.view.ViewPager providing it the ViewPager this layout is being used for.   ltpgt   The colors can be customized in two ways. The first and simplest is to provide an array of colors   via link setSelectedIndicatorColorsint.... The   alternative is via the link TabColorizer interface which provides you complete control over   which color is used for any individual position.   ltpgt   The views used as tabs can be customized by calling link setCustomTabViewint, int,   providing the layout ID of your custom layout.   public class SlidingTabLayout extends HorizontalScrollView             Allows complete control over the colors drawn in the tab layout. Set with       link setCustomTabColorizerTabColorizer.           public interface TabColorizer                      return return the color of the indicator used when code position is selected.                   int getIndicatorColorint position             private static final int TITLEOFFSETDIPS  24     private static final int TABVIEWPADDINGDIPS  10     private static final int TABVIEWTEXTSIZESP  12      private int mTitleOffset      private int mTabViewLayoutId     private int mTabViewTextViewId     private int mTabViewImageViewId     private boolean mDistributeEvenly      private ViewPager mViewPager     private SparseArrayltStringgt mContentDescriptions  new SparseArrayltStringgt     private ViewPager.OnPageChangeListener mViewPagerPageChangeListener      private final SlidingTabStrip mTabStrip      public SlidingTabLayoutContext context          thiscontext, null           public SlidingTabLayoutContext context, AttributeSet attrs          thiscontext, attrs, 0           public SlidingTabLayoutContext context, AttributeSet attrs, int defStyle          supercontext, attrs, defStyle           Disable the Scroll Bar         setHorizontalScrollBarEnabledfalse          Make sure that the Tab Strips fills this View         setFillViewporttrue          mTitleOffset  int TITLEOFFSETDIPS  getResources.getDisplayMetrics.density          mTabStrip  new SlidingTabStripcontext         addViewmTabStrip, LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT                  Set the custom link TabColorizer to be used.             If you only require simple custmisation then you can use       link setSelectedIndicatorColorsint... to achieve       similar effects.           public void setCustomTabColorizerTabColorizer tabColorizer          mTabStrip.setCustomTabColorizertabColorizer           public void setDistributeEvenlyboolean distributeEvenly          mDistributeEvenly  distributeEvenly                  Sets the colors to be used for indicating the selected tab. These colors are treated as a       circular array. Providing one color will mean that all tabs are indicated with the same color.           public void setSelectedIndicatorColorsint... colors          mTabStrip.setSelectedIndicatorColorscolors                  Set the link android.support.v4.view.ViewPager.OnPageChangeListener. When using link SlidingTabLayout you are       required to set any link android.support.v4.view.ViewPager.OnPageChangeListener through this method. This is so       that the layout can update its scroll position correctly.             see android.support.v4.view.ViewPagersetOnPageChangeListenerandroid.support.v4.view.ViewPager.OnPageChangeListener           public void setOnPageChangeListenerViewPager.OnPageChangeListener listener          mViewPagerPageChangeListener  listener                  Set the custom layout to be inflated for the tab views.             param layoutResId Layout id to be inflated       param textViewId id of the link android.widget.TextView in the inflated view           public void setCustomTabViewint layoutResId, int textViewId          mTabViewLayoutId  layoutResId         mTabViewTextViewId  textViewId                    Sets the associated view pager.

Positive 1177 pI have many tab panels being created dynamically in tab container based on what the user has selected from a listbox. If user has selected item1 and item2 from listbox, 2 tab panels will be created with tab ID and header text as item1 and item2.p  pI would like to add in chart with chartID chart1 into tab panel item1 and chart2 into tab panel item2. I want to use javascript to check if tab panel item1 and item2 exist, can check by tab id or tab headertext. It is something like if tab panel item1 exist, add chart1, then if item2 exist, add chart2, if item3 exist, add chart3, and so on..p  pThis is my codes currently, but is not working..p  precodefunction   RETRIEVEBUTTON.clickfunction       var str  Item 1      if str            panel.eachfunction               var title  this.text             if str  title                  alertexisting                              codepre  pAppreciate if someone could provide me help on this.

Positive 1177 pI have a page where there is a header with data to be displayed and there is a list of tabs dynamicaly displayed below the header. Data in tabs is related to header.

Each tab has its own controller, but all of controllers including the header one are in the same app module.

I have included all the tabs and their respective divisions using ngrepeat. The visibility respective content of all tabs in controlled by ngshowhide.

Negative 1177 pI have D2 program that, in its current form, is single threaded, and calls the same pure function about 10 to 100 times in an inner loop for each iteration of the outer loop of this program.  There is no data dependency among the calls, i.e. no call uses the result from any other call.  Overall, this function is called millions of times, and is the main bottleneck in my program.  The parameters are unique almost every time, so caching wouldnt help.p  pAt first glance, this seems like the perfect candidate for parallelization.  The only problem is that the function only takes about 3 microseconds per call, well below the latency of creating a new thread, and not that far above the overhead of adding a job to a task pool meaning, acquiring a mutex, allocating memory to hold information about the task, dealing with possible contention for the task pools queue, etc..

It has a few dialogs forms for management but its all about the data. The reason why its so big as there is a lot of error checking, event handling, and also the grid set up as masterdetail with 3 more grid for each row but these load on master row expanded. I hope this helps to clarify what Im on about. p

Negative 1177 pAfter running into major compatitiblity problems with C, ASP.NET, MS Access, Linux, and Mono, Ive decided to program in a language that is crossplatform, open source, and compatible with embedded databases that are also compatible with many platforms.

I purchased a book entitled Practical Programming in TCL and TK, downloaded TCLkit, and FreeWrap, yet I am having troubles finding a methodological way to convert TCL in TK Wish into a standalone application.p  pWould anyone be able to provide simple steps towards converting a TCL TK script, such as a label with text on it, into an application, or a web resource that has a pretty straight forward explanationp
Negative 1177 pIm in the process of starting an opensource project aimed at digitising a whole bunch of forms provided by a government department.  Basically at the moment if people need to fill out the forms they need to do so on paper, and Id like to change that so that it can be done on the computer.p  pAt present, the project has no official affiliation with the government and Id like to set it up in such a way that the public can help contribute to digitising the forms as there are a large number of forms.  At some point in the future, the forms may come to be of a standard where it would be feasible that they could be used officially by the government.  If this were to be the case, it would be ideal if there was some kind of remuneration, rather than the forms being handed over to the government free of charge.p  pIn such a case, how do you retain authority over where the money goes, given that the project could potentially have had many contributors  Obviously I would like to pass on remuneration to contributors that is based on how much they have each contributed, but is there any legal provisions or statements I would need to have in place to retain the authority to be the person that makes the decisions about who gets what  Is it a simple case of person that starts the project gets to decide, or would this be in breach of any laws surrounding intellectual property or copyright, given that part of what is sold would be other peoples contributionsp  pA case on a much larger scale similar to mine that I can think of is with Sun buying MySQL  who got to decide where the money from the sale went to, and what did they have to do to retain the authority to make such a decision  As an asides, what did Sun actually get out of purchasing MySQL that they could not have had by simply downloading it, given that it was open sourcep

Negative 1177 pThe .NET application for which Im responsible uses a thirdparty control that is only available as a 32 bit COM component.  Ive been banging my head against walls for a while trying to find a way to allow the component and the app to work together in 64bit mode.  We got some help from the control vendor  they dont plan on supplying a 64 bit version of the component anytime soon, but they attached a C solution that uses the WebBrowser control to load the component and a C solution that uses some fun OLE code to dig a reference to the controls interface out of the WebBrowser.p  pThe good news is that the code does what its supposed to do the component loads correctly inside of a 64 bit solution, and Im dredging up my old, spotty knowledge of ATL to work my way through the C solution to figure out how to retrieve the control interface into our C. p  pMy concern is that I dont understand this configuration nearly well enough to determine what problems I might be exposing our app to.

Negative 1177 pTheres a program written entirely in C that targets .NET Framework 2.0. Is there a way I could somehow compile translate managed EXE to a native one so it could be .NETagnostic I know there are probably commercial products for that purpose... but they are a bit expensive.p  pThe problem is that we are to deploy the program on computers running Windows XP with no .NET Framework installed. Theres also a requirement that the programs size must not exceed 500Kb 1Mb maximum for it is downloaded from the web server now the size is 255Kb. That is why theres no way we could attach a fullfledged .NET FX or even a reduced one to the downloaded programs file.p  pObviously it is a terrible software engineering error that should have been detected and avoided earlier so we could use native technologies like C instead.p  pWe have tried for now Novells Mono  an opensource implementation of .NET Framework for Linux, MAC and Windows. Mono consists of C Compiler, IDE,  runtime CLR and Class Library assemblies like System.dll and mscorlib.dll  much like .NETs class library assemblies installed to GAC. What we tried to do is to locate CLR files and ship those along with our programs file and a few assemblies. This way the program can be invoked by running mono program.exe command prompt on a users computer. In addition to the inconvenience of such a use for the end user CLR files mono.exe and mono.dll turned out to be about 2.5 Mb in total that is much greater than the desired 500 Kb or even 1 Mb.p  pSo, we have left with no other option but to translate our .NET App to a native one by a compiler, however the question remains  what compiler should we use and where could we find one...p  pFor now I have stumbled upon a Singularity OS Project by Microsoft Research. It is an opensource research OS that is written in managed code in part at least. The Singularity OS includes a Bartok compiler that the OS uses in order to translate a managed program to a native one x86 32 bit. It should be noted that Bartok cant translate all the aspects of .NET 2.0 to a native code, but most of them. However I havent yet learnt how to use the Singularity...p  pI would be really grateful to you if you could provide me with some useful tips and advice regarding the problem, your own experience with Singularity OS and Bartok Compiler or another approaches to the problem that I have overlooked and ways of solving it.p  pThank you very much in advance p  pFinally, using Monos Full AOT feature on Callum Rogers advice Ive managed to produce a program.exe.dll that lacks a CLI header.  So it looks to me like a native dll. However I cant figure out how to convert that dll into exe or make it operational.  Also this dll doesnt seem to expose any functions of interest such as main function.p

Negative 1177 pWe have just released a rewrittenfor the 3rd time module for our proprietary system.  This module, which we call the Load Manager, is by far the most complicated of all the modules in our system to date.  We are trying to get a comprehensive test suite because every time we make any kind of significant change to this module there is hell to pay for weeks in sorting out bugs and quirks.  However, developing a test suite has proven to be quite difficult so we are looking for ideas.p  pThe Load Managers guts reside in a class called LoadManagerHandler, this is essentially all of the logic behind the module.  This handler calls upon multiple controllers to do the CRUD methods in the database.  These controllers are essentially the top layer of the DAL that sits on top and abstracts away our LLBLGen generated code.p  pSo it is easy enough to mock these controllers, which we are doing using the Moq framework.  However the problem comes in the complexity of the Load Manager and the issues that we receive arent in dealing with the simple cases but the cases where there is a substantial amount of data contained within the handler.p  pTo briefly explain the load manager contains a number of unloaded details, sometimes in the hundreds, that are then dropped into user created loads and reship pools.  During the process of creating and populating these loads there is a multitude of deletes, changes, and additions that eventually cause issues to appear.  However, because when you mock a method of an object the last mock wins, iep  precodejobDetailControllerMock.Setupmock gt mock.GetById1.ReturnsjobDetail1 jobDetailControllerMock.Setupmock gt mock.GetById2.ReturnsjobDetail2 jobDetailControllerMock.Setupmock gt mock.GetById3.ReturnsjobDetail3 codepre  pNo matter what I send to jobDetailController.GetByIdx I will always get back jobDetail3.  This makes testing almost impossible because we have to make sure that when changes are made all points are affected that should be affected.  p  pSo, I resolved to using the test database and just allowing the reads and writes to occur as normal.  However, because you cantread should not dictate the order of your tests, tests that are run earlier could cause tests that run later to fail.  p  pTLDR I am essentially looking for testing strategies for data oriented code that is quite complex in nature.p

Negative 1177 pIm developing a new user store for my organisation and am now tackling password storage.  The concepts of salting, HMAC etc are all fine with me  and want to store the users passwords either salted and hashed, HMAC hashed, or HMAC salted and hashed  not sure what the best way will be  but in theory it wont matter as it will be able to change over time if required.p  pI want to have an XML amp JSON service that can act as a Security Token Service for clientside apps.p  pIve already developed one for another system, which requires that the client doubleencrypts a cleartext password using SHA1 first and then HMACSHA1 using a 128 unique key or nonce supplied by the server for that session only.p  pId like to repeat this technique for the new system  upgrading the algo to SHA256 chosen since implementations are readily available for all aforementioned platforms  and its much stronger than SHA1  but there is a problem.p  pIf Im storing the password as a salted hash in the userstore, the client will need to be sent that salt in order to construct the correct hash before being HMACd with the unique session key.  This would completely go against the point of using a salt in the first place.  Equally, if I dont use salt for password storage, but instead use HMAC, its still the same problem.p  pAt the moment, the only solution I can see is to use naked SHA256 hashing for the password in the user store, so that I can then use this as a starting point on both the server and the client for a more secure saltedhmacd password transfer for the web service.p  pThis still leaves the user store vulnerable to a dictionary attack were it ever to be accessed and however unlikely that might be  assuming it will never happen simply doesnt sit well with me.p  pGreatly appreciate any input.p

Negative 1177 pIm studying for my final exams in my CS major on the subject distributed systems and operating systems.p  pIm in the need for a good definition for the terms task, process and threads.

The maddening part is that the serverside code contains the JAXB annotations that are used by wsimport to create the clientside code, which works great, yet I cant marshal serverside Sensors due to the cycle.p  pI tried copying all of the extra annotations JAXB adds to the clientside code onto the serverside classes thinking perhaps there was a runtime bug in JAXB that was preventing it from properly applying the XmlIDREF annotation.  No luck there.p  pPerhaps theres something very basic Im missing here but this issue is driving me a little batty and Im at a dead stop while I try to figure it out.  p  pOne thing I did notice that Im investigating is that some of the namespaces on the generated clientside objects arent what I expected, though the code works.

Negative 1177 pI have a SQL table codeAddressCountcode that has 3 fields codeaddresscode, codestatecode, and codenumEntitiescode. What I want to do is get the sum of numEntities for each address  state combination based on a like. This is somewhat hard to describe, but I think the following correlated query represents correctly what Im trying to accomplishp  precodeSELECT Address, State,      SELECT SUMNumEntities     FROM AddressCount innerQry      WHERE innerQry.address LIKE   outerQry.address            AND innerQry.state  outerQry.state As NumEntities FROM AddressCount outerQry codepre  pBasically, I want to end up with a table that has an address, a state, and the sum of numEntities for all addresses like that address surrounded by wildcards. So, if the address is 25 Courtland Rd and the state is NJ, I want to get the sum of numEntities for all rows that have a state of NJ and an address like 25 Courtland Rd. Id love to be able to accomplish this with a GROUP BY LIKE, but I dont think this is possible with SQL. The basic concept is to accomplish something like thisp  precodeSELECT address, state, sumnumEntities FROM AddressCount GROUP BY LIKE   address   codepre  pThe correlated query sql statement I posted above seems accurate, but Id like to accomplish the same thing, if possible, by an inner join of the table on itself.

Negative 1177 pIn my project ASP.NET MVC  NHibernate I have all my entities, lets say codeDocumentcodes, described by set of custom metadata. Metadata is contained in a structure that can have multiple tags, categories etc. These terms have the most importance for users seeking the document they want, so it has an impact on views as well as underlying data structures, database querying etc.p  pFrom view side of application, what interests me the most are the string values for the terms. Ideally I would like to operate directly on the collections of strings like thatp  precodeclass MetadataAsSeenInViews      public IListltstringgt Categories     public IListltstringgt Tags      etc.  codepre  pFrom model perspective, I could use the same structure, do the simplestpossible ORM mapping and use it in queries like fetch all documents with metadata exactly like this.p  pBut that kind of structure could turn out useless if the application needs to perform complex database queries like fetch all documents, for which strongat least onestrong of categories is codeIN cat1, cat2, ..., catNcode strongOR at least onestrong of tags is codeIN tag1, ..., tagNcode. In that case, for performance reasons, we would probably use numeric keys for categories and tags.p  pSo one can imagine a structure opposite to codeMetadataAsSeenInViewscode that operates on numeric keys and provide complex mappings of integers to strings and other way round. But that solution doesnt really satisfy me for several reasonsp  ul liit smells like single responsibility violation, as were dealing with databasespecific issues when just wanting to describe codeDocumentcode business objectli lidatabase keys are leaking through all layersli liit adds unnecessary complexity in viewsli liand I believe it doesnt take advantage of what can good ORM doli ul  pIdeally I would like to havep  ul lisingle, as simple as possible metadata structure ideally like the one at the top in my whole applicationli licomplex querying issues addressed only in the database layer meaning DB  ORM  at less as possible additional code for data layerli ul  pDo you have any ideas how to structure the code and do the ORM mappings to be as elegant, as effective and as performant as it is possiblep

Negative 1177 pstrongShort storystrongp  pThe NSArrayControllers selection is being reset whenever setContent is issued. I am wondering if there is a way to turn this off.p  pOf course, this would be the only acceptable behaviour if I would let NSArrayController use its internal selectionIndexes, because then it wouldnt be able to keep track of both. However, the selectionIndexes are rewired as well, and this part goes off without a hitch. It still feels the need to reset the selection, though.p  pstrongUpdate Ugly hack solutionstrong p  pIve moved this to an answer. I would be pleased to see another more insightful answer though.p  pstrongLong storystrongp  pI have a Cocoa Documentbased Application with an inspector panel that is shared between documents modelled after the TextEdit source code that ships with xcode. Inside the Document class I have an NSMutableArray and an NSMutableIndexSet that are linked up with bindings to an NSArrayController. p  pThe inspector panel is in a separate nib file, and I have two identical NSArrayControllers, one from the main document window, and one from the inspector panel, so that both can interact with the document. This is why I do a manual binding to the selectionIndexes, so that I dont get two separate selections with the two separate NSArrayControllers.p  pThe inspector panel keeps track of which document is being inspected by ap  precodeDocument inspectedDocument codepre  pwhich is updated whenever the document is switched, or no document has focus at all. An NSObjectController is linked up to codeinspectedDocumentcode, and the NSArrayController I mentioned before is linked up to that controller.p  pNow, my problem is that when the inspector panel is in place, and the codeinspectedDocumentcode is changed, the selection indexes are reset. The problem goes away if I dont use the inspector panel, so I assume it is its NSArrayController that is issuing this reset. I dont have any controls that bind to the selection and could change it such as a table view.p  pIn the inspector panels NSArrayController, if I have Avoid Empty Selection ticked, the selection resets to the first object, otherwise it resets to no selection, so it is definitely a legitimate resetting of the selection. Actually, I dont even want the inspector panel to ever be able to change the selection, so ideally I would like to establish a readonly binding for that NSArrayControllers selection indexes.p

Same issue as above, I cant get this to work properly.p  pI was hoping that someone would be able to give me a working example of encrypting and decrypting a binary file similar to what I have setup belowp  precodeprivate void button1Clickobject sender, EventArgs e               SimpleAES sa  new SimpleAES         OpenFileDialog ofd  new OpenFileDialog          string s  string.Empty         byte[] b  null          if ofd.ShowDialog  DialogResult.OK                       textBox1.Text  ofd.FileName             b  File.ReadAllBytesofd.FileName             b  sa.EncryptByteToStringb                   File.WriteAllBytesEnvironment.GetFolderPathEnvironment.SpecialFolder.Desktop  TestData123.exe, b            private void button2Clickobject sender, EventArgs e              SimpleAES sa  new SimpleAES          byte[] b  File.ReadAllBytesEnvironment.GetFolderPathEnvironment.SpecialFolder.Desktop  TestData123.exe         string s  sa.Decryptb          File.DeleteEnvironment.GetFolderPathEnvironment.SpecialFolder.Desktop  TestData123.exe         File.WriteAllBytesEnvironment.GetFolderPathEnvironment.SpecialFolder.Desktop  TestData.exe, b           public byte[] StringToBytestring s              Byte[] b  new byte[s.Length]          for int i  0 i lt s.Length i                      char c  Convert.ToChars.Substringi, 1             b[i]  Convert.ToBytec                  return b           public string ByteToStringbyte[] input              StringBuilder ss  new System.Text.StringBuilder          for int i  0 i lt input.Length i                       Convert each byte to char             char c  Convert.ToCharinput[i]             ss.AppendConvert.ToStringc                   return ss.ToString      codepre  pHere is the AES class I am usingp  precodeusing System using System.Data using System.Security.Cryptography using System.IO   public class SimpleAES       Change these keys     private byte[] Key   123, 217, 19, 11, 24, 26, 85, 45, 114, 184, 27, 162, 37, 112, 222, 209, 241, 24, 175, 144, 173, 53, 196, 29, 24, 26, 17, 218, 131, 236, 53, 209      private byte[] Vector   146, 64, 191, 111, 23, 3, 113, 119, 231, 121, 221, 112, 79, 32, 114, 156    private ICryptoTransform EncryptorTransform, DecryptorTransform private System.Text.UTF8Encoding UTFEncoder  public SimpleAES      This is our encryption method     RijndaelManaged rm  new RijndaelManaged      Create an encryptor and a decryptor using our encryption method, key, and vector.

Negative 1177 pemFirst of all, I dont really know whats wrong with dependent types and why we dont see them implemented in existing languages for practical programming,  instead of inventing all kind of tricks patterns to bypass  the limitations of current type systems which at best has very  simple and limited generalization.emp  pBut my question is about Dependent types for data not a program, how or can we use them for structured data validation Meaning, like json or xml or any kind of  structured  data , is it possible to verify them efficiently using some dependent type system p  pstrongEditstrongp  pI meant by dependent types its most wide definition  type that depends on a value, and not necessary those theorem prover and CoC staff. I dont know them and I dont want to go that road, I dont believe those the only nor the ultimate way to get decent dependent types. In FP, coders write their most complex logic everyday in very elegant, constructive way with all simplicity and having no problem at all. I believe they will have their ultimate elegant dependent typing. p  pHowever, my question was about pure Data , unlike in code when a lot of checking can be just unnecessary, and can just  hiding in program flow and logic, even dynamic typing can work fine that way. In data, its not the case when you want to check some document correctness and give clear error messages. In another hand data does not have the complexity problem when you have to deal with functions in very extreme dependent type system of CoC family.p

Negative 1177 pI use a UIView animation to randomly animate 5 squares UIButtons around the screen. Depending on a user selection, there are anywhere from 2 to 5 squares visible. When only 2 are visible, the other threes hidden values get set to YES, so they are actually still animating right, they just arent visible.

Negative 1177 pI have codeJTablecode. In it I have few columns. In 3 of them I have codeJComboBoxcode each columns each cell has unique codeJComboBoxcode  i.e. whole column 1  apple, bannana column 2  red, blue column 3  cat, dog. At program start I want them to be empty. Later after few action events Im filling them. The thing is, its not enough to add codeJComboBoxcode with same values for each column. Because after adding codeJComboBoxcode to codeJTablecode, you have to implement codeTableCellRenderercode and extend codeDefaultCellEditorcode or else you cant see codeJComboBoxcode in table unless you click on it codeTableCellRenderercode fault or instead of comboBox you get just Object.toString line in cell codeDefaultCellRenderercode fault. So how should I handle codeJComboBoxcode, codeTableCellRenderercode and codeDefaultCellEditorcode so I can dynamicly change values of whole codeJComboBoxcode which is in codeJTablecode.p

Negative 1177 pIm just not getting why this is happeningp  pSuccessfully create dialog and instantiate it when user clicks on an item.  Zero problems getting dialog to show when desired and to go away when back is pressed....p  pThe problem is    If the dialog is still displaying when the applicationactivity goes away pause, die, when it returns, the dialog is still presented but no variables which are context specific are presented.  Note  I do issue removeDialog for the dialog in the onPause.  Yet mystically when the app returns, its somehow cycled thru onPrepareDialog and loaded up with missing variables xml names show.p  pWhat I want is for the dialog to go away and let the user make a different choice from the main activity and then redisplay the dialog  if thats what they want.  Or said another way  I want dialog to always go away if the app goes away.p  pIve looked into persisting the data but there doesnt seem to be a right spot in the restore process to do that or Im just ignorant.  I cant figure out why onPrepareDialog is getting invoked during onResume....p
Negative 1177 pIm not experienced with sitemaps  only just started looking into them.  I have an app where the user can choose to do a short quizquestion and answer session.

Negative 1177 pWhat are the pros and cons of using a dumpfile as a basis of data and schema migration, as opposed to fully script based or a database delta tool p  pThe context is that the application is in production, and there is only one production database.  The application and database schema are in active development.  Critical user data exists in the production database and must be rolled forward with deployment of new versions or fixes.p  pThe solutions being discussed are  p  pDump file basis p  ol liStart with a reference point dump file.li liDatabase alter scripts are checked into source control.li liDeployment entails loading the dump file and then running the alter scriptsli ol  pSchema  migration p  ol liEntire schema and certain nonuser configuration data are stored as DDLs and DMLs in SCM.li liMigrations scripts against the latest releases schema are stored in SCM.li liDeployment entails loading the schema then migrating the data.  3.li ol  pMy intuition is that using a binary format as the basis is bad, but I need to be able to convince others if that is indeed the case, who argue that it is necessary. p  hr  pI reformulated this question to make it easier to answer.p  pBelow is the original question p  blockquote   pI am working with a team on a database driven enterprise application   and looking to improve our process.  Currently, there is a lot of   manual process around updating the database on all tiers.  The goal is   having automated process for updating the database consistently and in   an automated fashion, in line with the idea of atomic commits and   closer towards continuous delivery, which would bring numerous   advantages. p      pI think that the schema and certain data necessary for application   configuration should be represented in source control, and in   addition, any scripts necessary to transform and load user data from   the current production database.  I have read that it is not advisable   to have a dump file .dmp in source control, and intuitively, I agree   strongly.  However I am not agreed with by everyone on the project.    The counter argument is that in reality it is not possible, or at   least is too difficult, to emnotem start with a dump file. I am up   against my limit of database knowledge and cant really debate   meaningfully...  I am more a developer and not a database specialist.    The alternative suggested is that alter scripts be kept that alter the   dump to the latest schema.p      pCan someone help me understand the pros and cons of each approach   little better Is the dumpbased approach necessary, a good idea, or   not a good idea, and why p      pA little background that may be relevant the application is in   production so each new version must import data as a part of the   deployment process, and for obvious reasons on integration and UAT   tiers this should be real data.  However this app is not shipped and   installed by customers, there is only one instance of production at a   given time, maintained internally.  I realize there will be details   specific to my project so the answer will have to address the general   case.p blockquote

Negative 1177 pI have a stored procedure that is doing a MERGE. It seems given the volume of traffic, that two requests are calling INSERT instead of UPDATE at the same time. One of these requests fails because of a foreign key constraint. If I put my merge statement inside a try catch and try to reexecute the sproc, Im assuming it will run the UPDATE portion of the MERGE this time and succeed. Thoughts on this, is it considered goodbad practicep  pIm using SQL Server 2008 if that matters.p  pcheers in advancep

Negative 1177 pMy hobby is writing up stuff on a personal wiki site a hrefhttpcomparch.net relnofollowhttpcomparch.neta. Currently using mediawiki although I often regret having chosen it, since I need per page access control.p  pOften I create pages that define several terms or concepts on the same page.  E.g. a hrefhttpsemipublic.comparch.netwikiInvalidatebeforewritingversuswritethroughistheinvalidate relnofollowhttpsemipublic.comparch.netwikiInvalidatebeforewritingversuswritethroughistheinvalidatea.p  pOftentimes such A versus B pages provide the only definitions of A and B.  Or at least the only definitions that I have so far gotten around to writing.br Sometimes I will define many more that two topics on the same page.p  pIf I create such an A vs B or other paging containing multiple definitions D1, D2, ... DN, I would like to emautomaticallyem create redirect pages, so that I can say [[A]] or [[B]] or [[D1]] .. [[DN]] in other pages.p  pAt the moment the only way I know of to create such pages is manually.  Its hard to keep up.p  pFurthermore, at the time I create such a page, I would like to provide some page text  typicaly a category.p  hr  pHeres another example variant page names.  I often find that I want to create several variants of a page name, all linking to the same place. For example [[multithreading]], [[multithreading MT]], [[MT multithreading]], [[MT]]p  pPlease dont tell me to use piped links. Thats NOT what I wantp  hr  pTWiki has plugins such as p  ul liTOPICCREATE automatically create topics or attach files at topic save timeli ul  pMore than that, I remember a twiki plugin, whose name I cannot remember or google up, that included the text of certain subpages within your current opage.  You could then edit all of these pages together, and save  and the text would be extracted and distributed as needed.  By the way, if you can remember the name of tghat package, please remind me.  It had certain problems, particularly wrt file locking IIRC it only locked the top file for editing, bot the subtopics, so you could lose stuff.p  pBut this last, in combination with parameterized templtes, would be almost everything I need.p  pQ does mediawiki have something similar  I cant find it.p  hr  pI suppose that I can  could should wrote my own robot to perform such actions.p

Negative 1177 pIm writing a simple 2D game for Android with a 300x200 play area with coords running from 0,0 to 299,199. Id want this area to fill the screen as best as possible while maintaining its aspect ratio. e.g. if the GL view fills the full 800x480 of a device I could scale the area by 2.4x to 720x480 leaving 40 pixels of space either side. p  pI dont expect many devices would exactly scale in both dimensions so the code has to cope with a gap either in the horizontal or vertical.p  pSo the question is how do I do this. My play area is 2D so I can use an orthgraphic projection. I just dont understand what values I need to plug in to set this up. I also suspect that because ES 2.0 has a heavy reliance on shaders that I might need to propagate some kind of scaling matrix to a vector shader to ensure objects are rendered to the right size.p  pDoes anyone know of a good tutorial which perhaps talks in terms that make sense for my needs Most tutorials Ive seen seem content to dump a cube or square into the middle of the screen rather than rendering an area of exact dimensions.p

Negative 1177 pTrying to teach myself EF Code First, and have got the initial database creation setup extended the way I want it for now and the initial creation of a database going, but trying to figure out how best to handle and manage future updates a database and still work with creating new databases.p  pIve come up with a scenario that I havent found any good examples or suggestions for online.  I want an application that the user can create a new database, which creates a new database based on the existing model based on the POCO objects in the code at that time.  As I said, that works fine for me so far.  A bit later, a program update comes along, and via the migrations objects in the assembly, it knows what to do and updates the database using the EF Code First migrations using the DbMigrator.Update method.  So far good to go, at least for the initial version of the program.p  pNow, later on down the line, in a newer version, they want to create a new database for whatever reason.  So they do based on the current model in the code at that time, and that works fine.  However, there are these other migrations from before that point in the assembly that dont need to be run at all since the model already has any changes that might be needed setup and ready to go, but the newly created migrations table doesnt know that they dont, at least as far as I can tell.  I dont want them run, but I want any future updates to be applied to any database that needs them later on.p  pMy thought, from what Ive read so far, is I need to create additional logic to track what the latest DB migration is in the code using some kind of timestamp property for the various migrations to determine the order upon creation and somehow tell it not to actually do any migration updates that are there before that dateversion, but the EF migration logic will still update the MigrationHistory table with the info that tells it that that particular migration has been run.  Im thinking that Ill do this manually via reflection to get the migration objects and running them in order by specifying the migration object name into the update method, but have some check to prevent actually running the database changes during initialization.  Then when any new ones pop up later on after a code update, the older migrations wont run since they are already in the MigrationHistory table, but the DbMigrator.Update method will still run any newer migrations missing from the table.p  pBefore I spent a lot of time figuring that logic out I wanted to make sure there wasnt something in the documentation or coming down the pipe that I was completely overlooking or missed that handled this better already built in andor get some input on the best way to handle this case.  It seems like a fairly common scenario in my opinion, but I dont see a good way of handling it with the base EF logic.p

So Ill edit my question slightly by generalizing beyond only MSAccess dbs. Can complex queries be updated via DBGrids in other popular databasesp

Negative 1177 pI am building a databasebacked web application with an administrator module and a user module.  The administrator module allows an admin to modify properties of entities stored in the database.  The user module serves dynamically generated forms based on the state of the database.p  pConsider the following use casep  ol liA user requests a web page containing a form where the form options presented represent DB entities that meet a certain criteriali liThe requested page containing the dynamically generated form loads.li liThe admin makes changes in the DB to some entities loaded in the form such that they no longer meet the criteria to be displayed in the form ie inactivated, deassociatedli liThe user submits the form with at least one entity selected that no longer meets the criteria to be displayed in the form.li ol  pShould the serverside validation of the submitted form pass or fail in this scenariop  pThe user was served a valid form but the posted form content is no longer valid with respect to the current state of the DB due to admin changes while the user was on the page...p  pIf it should pass, should I be validating the data against the state of the database when the page loaded leveraging the database history or using the session or is that overkill and instead I could just validate that the posted entity is valid but does not necessarily meet the current form criteriap

However if the User is logged in to several Google Accounts at once, Google redirects the user to a SelectSession interface.p  pWhen the user is directed to a hrefhttpsaccounts.google.comooauth2auth... relnofollowhttpsaccounts.google.comooauth2auth...a he ends on a hrefhttpswww.google.comaSelectSession relnofollowhttpswww.google.comaSelectSessiona. This is unnecessary, because I already know which session he wants to use.p  pDoes anyone know a way to automatically select a specific account, so that the user does not need to manually select the session at a hrefhttpswww.google.comaSelectSession relnofollowhttpswww.google.comaSelectSessionap

Negative 1177 pI have just finished installed xCode 4.5 and have been trying to understand the new simulator. I want to test my app in the old screen size and new screen size. However when under the simulator I go to hardware and change the phone size to the 4 inch size, it changes the simulator to take up the full screen, has no home button, is zoomed in, and I have to scroll to navigate which is really frustrating and annoying.p  pFrom thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9aZbE.png altenter image description herep  pTo thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoBmbo.png altenter image description herep  pCould someone tell me if this is meant to happen I want to maintain the normal iPhone look with the simulator, that zoomed in scrollable simulator is terrible, looks horrible and makes debugging a pain. I am sure Apple would not allow something this poor looking to be the normal look for the simulator so I am guessing I am doing something wrong.p  pThe other problem with it is, if I am on the home screen where I can see a list of custom apps under normal iPhone screen size, then change it to the 4 inch simulator screen size, the custom apps I installed on the simulator are not showing for some reason.p  pAny help would be much appreciatedp  pEditp  pI found I change the scale of the simulator under window and changing it to 50 or 75. However one problem remains, why is there no home button in the iPhone 5 simulatorp

Negative 1177 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIve had problems for quite a while now with players cheating in my android game. For a strict singleplayer game this wouldnt be a big issue, but since my game contains multiplayer battles and global highscore lists, its causing legit players to stop playing because of the cheaters.p  pstrongHow they cheatstrongp  pCheaters use an app for root users called a hrefhttpwww.cih.com.twgamecihGameciha. Gamecih lets users pause an app, change variable values, and then resume the app. So in my case they just pause the game, change health to 74 trillions and then kick the crap out of everyone on multiplayer. Heres a a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvg4kGyFboTMvideoa showing how Gamecih is used to cheat in Fruit Ninjanot my game.p  pstrongConsidered methodsstrongp  ol liCode obfuscation. This wont work because obfuscation doesnt change variable emvaluesem, just variable emnamesem. This means that cheaters can still find the variable that has the same value as their current health and then change that variable.li liCode obfuscation  getter amp setter value changing. This way, health will not actually represent the real health value. In the getter method I would do something like return health10 and in the setter I would do healthinput10 This could of course be more complicated.li ol  pstrongWhat I wantstrongp  pIt could be argued that considered method nr 2 is what I should use, but then again, it doesnt prevent hacking, it just makes it harder. Ideally, I would like to detect when people cheat using Gamecih, display a popup saying Darn you, you nasty hacker, and then close the application. I do emnotem want a serverdependent solution as I would like my players to be able to play while offline as well. If possible, I would also like to avoid code obfuscation.p

Negative 1177 pIm animating a sprite on a pixel grid. I have a few options, with pros and cons for each. I have a fair amount of javascript experience six years, but none with this kind of thing. The problem is I dont know how expensive each option will be.p  pThe sprite needs to render quite fast, and be inexpensive enough to have at least five running at the same time while running collision detection.p  pIdeally, I would like to use a grid of elements inside of a wrapper, rendering colour and alpha channels to each element from a multidimensional array. The major pro here is that I can run pixelbypixel collision detection and click past the transparent parts of the sprite. With any imagebased sprite, the onClick event will fire even if I click on a transparent pixel Ill have to do a lot of work to pass clicks through transparent pixels, and it might be quite expensive.p  pThe next option is to use css sprites. csstricks.comcsssprites This would be easy peasy, but as mentioned previously, onClicks wont pass through the transparent pixels. I can probably force it, but again, it may be expensive, and take a lot of time to impliment.p  pAnother option is animated gifs, but they are huge, limited in the colour department, and hard to control animationwise. Id rather not go there.p  pAnd then theres the html5 canvas element, which I dont know very much about and would like to stay away from if at all possible. I dont know how any of my code would even work in relation to the canvas element and I doubt it would do what I want in the longrun.p  pSo which is the best for performance Would the first and most preferable be a viable option Or have I missed something outp

Negative 1177 pIn lieu of saving credit card information locally for recurring payments I was thinking I could request an authorization from a payment gateway for a certain amount and then capture that amount multiple times, every month or so.p  pOne Payment Gateways documentation says Captures can be submitted for an amount equal to or less than the original authorization.  Thats a little bit of a problem since these recurring payments would be variable ie. youre billed based on how many API requests you make, which could be more or less than last month.  Another payment gateways documentation says you can only capture when the original Authorization Only transaction was submitted within the previous 30 days, which makes me think that a second capture done sixty days out vs the thirty days out of the first capture wouldnt work.p  pFrom what Ive read a lot of places do recurring payments by saving the credit card number encrypted but not the CVV and then recurring charges they do a new authorize and capture transaction each month.  Problem with this, as I understand it, though, is that saving the CC , even if encrypted, requires a hrefhttpswww.pcisecuritystandards.orgdocumentspcidssv2.pdf relnofollowfull PCI DSS compliancea, which administratively, seems to be a huge hassle, with requirements like emVerify access to all audit trails is loggedem and emVerify that logs for externalfacing technologies for  example, wireless, firewalls, DNS, mail are offloaded or copied  onto a secure centralized internal log server or mediaem.p  pauthorize.net has a a hrefhttpdeveloper.authorize.netapicim relnofollowCIM APIa that seems like itd fit the bill but I dunno...  my employer doesnt want to work with authorize.net so I guess thats off the table.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 1177 pI would like to know if anyone could point me in the right direction here.p  pSuppose I have a video file in some encoding e.g., H.264, and I decode this video using CUDAs video decoding library httpsdeveloper.nvidia.comnvidiacodeclibraries. What this would do I presume, is it would decode the video and play it on the screen. So far so good.p  pNow, what I would really like to do is modify the decoding library or write a wrapper, or something of that sort, to perform some postprocessing on the video frames. p  pFor example, suppose the video has 1000 frames, and I would like to in realtime add some custom effects to emsomeem specified by the user of the frames e.g., render a 3d modelpassed in by the userand overlay the output to some location in the frame, etc. p  pI guess my question really isp  ol liIs this possible at all li liDoes anybody know of any code samples that can accomplish this or something similar or tutorials, papers, manuals, anything at allli ol  pThanksp
Negative 1177 pBefore going into the details of this question, Id like to point out that I have never seen this done before, and would be rather curious to see if it can actually be done, and if so, how to go about doing it.p  pIm currently sitting on a template loader, and to write it, I have chosen to slightly adapt the HAML file format and extend it with a couple of logic operators  loops, mostly. To do so efficiently, Id need to pass a list of parameters to the template parser...and Id prefer to avoid this if possible. While brainstorming for alternatives, the idea came around that maybe, just maybe, it would be possible to reference the scope in which the function was called.p  pCurrently, Im calling the template parser for a file as follows. Suppose codetestcode is a route.p  precodefunction test     q  UserModelgttetheruserIDgtfetchPermissions    UtilTemplatinggtparsefile.haml  codepre  pWhat Im trying to avoid is being able to access q without passing a massively long array as second parameter. My original thought was that there might be a way for codeparsecode to inherit the scope in which it was originally called here, inside codetestcode rather than having its own. Is there a way to manage this, and if so, how efficient is itp

I want it to send the data when the connection is reestablished and the only hook I can see is Protocol.connectionMade.  However, that method is called embeforeem the TLS handshaking is actually done so it ends up being caught by an a hrefhttptwistedmatrix.comtracbrowsertagsreleasestwisted12.3.0twistedprotocolstls.pyL514 relnofollowexception handler in writea and placed into another buffer to be sent later.  strongButstrong, that buffer a hrefhttptwistedmatrix.comtracbrowsertagsreleasestwisted12.3.0twistedprotocolstls.pyL411 relnofollowonly seems to be sent if data is received from the other enda which doesnt occur very often in my case, and would also mean that the data could arrive at the other end in the wrong order because a write may be called before data is received.  I also think another disconnection before data is received will also cause that buffer of data to just be wiped.p  pEDIT  added sample code for the first issue.  Its probably odd that I have that codeactiveconnectioncode in the Factory, but I am trying to make it work as a singleton.p

Negative 1177 pSuppose I have two arrays of size codemcode and codencodep  pcodea[1] a[2] a[3] ..... a[m]codep  pandp  pcodeb[1] b[2] b[3] ..... b[n]codep  pI want to form a new array merging these two arrays such that in the new array of codem  ncode elements, codea[i]code is always placed befor codea[i  1]code and codeb[i]code is always placed before codeb[i  1]code. For example, codea[1] a[2] b[1] b[2]... b[n] a[m]code will be a valid array but codea[2] a[1] b[1] b[2] ... b[n] a[m]code wont. Given codemcode and codencode, how many such combinations will be possible when repeating is allowedp  pI have the intuition to solve the problemp  pcode b[1]  b[2]  b[3]  .....  b[n]codep  pI can place codea[1]code in any of the coden  1code places within the array codebcode, and considering the front and the last place, I have coden  1code total ways of placing codea[1]code. If I place codea[1]code in the first place just before codeb[1]code, I can now place codea[2]code in coden  1code places. But if I place codea[1]code just after codeb[1]code, I would have codencode ways to place codea[2]code. I can apply this approach recursively for all codea[i]code where code1 lti lt ncode. But I cant find any mathematical formula to express the solution, besides I cant understand how to approach when repeating is allowed.p

Negative 1177 pIm importing an .sql file that I created with SQLExplorer into my .NET program using StreamReader which will eventually be passed through OdbcConnection, fyi.  The problem is that when I use the codeReadToEndcode method it not only imports the SQL itself, but it imports all of the formatting.  So the string is littered with codercode and codetcode and the like.  p  pIve been looking at both using split or possibly regex to break the string down and remove the unwanted bits and pieces.

Negative 1177 pI am working with a hasmany through for the first time, and despite a lot of reading here and in the a hrefhttpguides.rubyonrails.orgassociationbasics.htmlthehasmanythroughassociation relnofollowguidea  I am not understanding the correct way to access attributes on the through table. My tables are the same as this example from another post.p  precode    class Product lt ActiveRecordBase        hasmany collaborators        hasmany users, through gt collaborators     end      class User lt ActiveRecordBase        hasmany collaborators        hasmany products, through gt collaborators    end     class Collaborator lt ActiveRecordBase       belongsto product       belongsto user    end codepre  pAssuming that the collaborators table has additional attributes, say hoursspent, what is the correct way to find the hoursspent from the collaborator table for a particular user and product p  pWhen I have found my users via the product, and am iterating over them as in p  precode    product.users.each do user  codepre  pThis seems to work p  precode    user.collaborator[0].hoursspent codepre  pI get the correct value, but since there should only be one  collaborator record for each UserProduct pair, the index is throwing me off, making me think Im doing something wrong. p  pThank you for reading p  pEDITp  pPerhaps I am not getting the hasmany through concept. Maybe a MySQL example would help.p  pWhat I was thinking is that if I did p  precode    SELECT  FROM collaborators where userid  1 codepre  pI would expect a set zero or more as the result. Similarly p  precode    SELECT  FROM collaborators where productid  1 codepre  pwould also give me a set, but p  precode    SELECT  FROM collaborators where userid  1 and productid  1 codepre  pwould give at most 1 row. p  pIf I am understanding properly, all 3 queries return a set. So I guess I need some kind of uniqueness constraint, but that would have to be a compound key of sorts, on both of the belongs to keys. Is that even possible Is there a structure that better models this p  pThanks so much for the quick and helpful responses p

For some reason, I cant get cURL to work with a new service that I have to consume. All I need to do is submit a soap request using a method described in the services wsdl, and download the soap response as an XML file to my local server.

However, it gets overwritten by the trigger, which changes the scope identity to the primary key of codetempwctriggertestcode.p  pHow can I stop the trigger overwriting codescopeidentitycodep  pI realise there is not much code to help here, which would normally be classed as a bad question, but I dont have permission to access to the full application code at the moment, so I am hoping this is answerable as is.p  pThis is on SQL Server 2008 R2p  pEDIT I have looked at the code, and it strongdoes use scopeidentitystrongp

Negative 1177 pHow can I create a trigger that will check one field of created View. Basically, a field in my View table displays total amount of products added to database. The trigger will have a specified maximum total amount so when the sum of products added to database will reach the maximum the trigger should alert user and make it impossible to add more products.p  pBy the way, Im not sure if setting triggers with views is the best way to achieve my aim.

Negative 1177 pI am using SQL Server 2008 to maintain a database where I have an codeuserAcccountscode table where the user details are stored while registering on the website. The codeuserIDcode column is an integer with identity on.p  pWhat I have noticed is that somehow, the column is skipping some ids random number of ids, sometimes it skips 5,11,10 etc, i.e., the IDs are not consecutive. I have a read a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2387285sqlserver2005identityincrementingbyitselfrq1similar question herea, with a similar issue which suggested p  blockquote   pAn identity sequence is incremented any time an insert is attempted    this includes a failed or rolled back INSERTp blockquote  pI have checked my logs for errors, but there were no error during the period when the ids were skipped. Also my insert is not within any transaction for a rollback to happen, because there is no requirement of deleting an account. Also no other tables are involved during the registrationp  pAlthough this is not a major issue as the ids will be unique nevertheless, what I would like to find out is why this behavior  Perhaps I am overlooking something. p  pAre there any other scenarios where this kind of behavior can occur i.e. the identity column skipping a few ids Could this be an issue with concurrent access p  phere is the tables create script. p  precodeCREATE TABLE [dbo].[UserAccounts]     [AccountID] [int] IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL,     [FirstName] [varchar]30 NULL,     [LastName] [varchar]30 NULL,     [Gender] [varchar]10 NULL,     [Email] [varchar]150 NULL,     [EmailVerified] [bit] NULL,     [UserName] [varchar]30 NULL,     [Password] [varchar]50 NULL,     [ProfilePicture] [varchar]150 NULL,     [BackgroundPicture] [varchar]150 NULL,     [DateOfBirth] [smalldatetime] NULL,     [CreateDate] [smalldatetime] NULL,     [LastUpdatedOn] [smalldatetime] NULL,     [Points] [int] NULL,     [CurrentBadge] [varchar]30 NULL,     [FBID] [varchar]50 NULL,     [TwitterID] [varchar]50 NULL,     [Abused] [int] NULL,     [isActive] [bit] NULL,     [AccountTypeID] [int] NULL,     [DateStamp] [timestamp] NOT NULL,     [Location] [varchar]50 NULL,     [About] [varchar]250 NULL,     [UsingBackgroundPicture] [bit] NULL,  CONSTRAINT [PKUserAcco349DA5867F60ED59] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED       [AccountID] ASC WITH PADINDEX   OFF, STATISTICSNORECOMPUTE   OFF, IGNOREDUPKEY  OFF, ALLOWROWLOCKS   ON, ALLOWPAGELOCKS   ON ON [PRIMARY]  ON [PRIMARY] codepre  pAny help in this regard is appreciated Also if you require any other detail, please let me know.p  pThanksp

It needs to be able to stop in this sleep periodp  pCurrently this is performed by the followingp  precodeprivate int threadSleepMinutes  60  private readonly Mutex mutTerminateService  new Mutexfalse  private Thread serviceThread  private Thread serviceStopThread   Use this flag to allow the Start op to wait for serviceStopThread  to get going before continuing to create the main loop thread private volatile bool stopService  true  public void Start      this.serviceStopThread  new Threadthis.RunServiceStopThread     this.serviceStopThread.IsBackground  true     this.serviceStopThread.Start      while stopService              Thread.Sleep100            Some things renamed to anonymise... you get the idea     this.serviceThread  new Threadthis.BigLoopMethod     this.serviceThread.IsBackground  true     this.serviceThread.Start   public void Stop       Release the mutex to terminate the service     serviceStopThread.Resume       Wait 5s max     int timeout  5000     while this.serviceThread.IsAlive ampamp timeout gt 0              Thread.Sleep100         timeout  100        private void RunServiceStopThread       To guarantee the same thread takes the mutex      and releases it in dot net 4, do both ops in this single thread      Dot net 4 the Start and Stop are now usually on different threads.     mutTerminateService.WaitOne     stopService  false       Suspend ourself     serviceStopThread.Suspend       Release the mutex     mutTerminateService.ReleaseMutex   public void BigLoopMethod      try            do                  bool moreOperationsToGo  true  Just dummy flags and stuff methods here           while moreOperationsToGo ampamp mutTerminateService.WaitOne0                          DoStuff                        Using this mutex here to sleep nicely  event driven.            Gracefully continues after timeout and gracefully exits if             triggered by the mutex.              while mutTerminateService.WaitOnethis.threadSleepMinutes  60000          catch Exception ex               Exception handling amp logging here       codepre  pNow I get messages saying Suspend and Resume are deprecated. In my situation, I know emexactlyem what code the suspend was run on since the call itself is what suspended it Resume, I know exactly what it is going to do. The only reason this was even done in the first place was because the mutex worked fine in Start and Stop in dot net 3.5 but dot net 4.0 changed so that Start and Stop were in different threads AND they marked the workaround as obsoletep  pIs there a nice way, nonobsolete way of doing thisp  pThanksp
Negative 1177 pI have a bunch of codeCcode files in a directory called codesrccode. I needed to find all the files that have codeTest.cccode, but without the code.cccode file type, so it would just be code[filename]Testcode.

Negative 1177 pIm a newbie in cakephp and Im trying to build an application from the scratch. Im reading the manual and also I did the tutorials.p  pRight now Im facing an issue about authorization How allow the users to do an action edit,delete,... but only if its their own thing post,events,..., using ActionsAuthorize and ControllersAuthorize at the same time.

Negative 1177 pIm having a little bit of trouble with my play application and the database. My postgresql server has a max connections of 150 and i have 5 applications running.p  pThe db config looks like this p  precodedb.default.partitionCount3 db.default.maxConnectionsPerPartition5 db.default.minConnectionsPerPartition5 codepre  pSo every play application should only have 15 connections, with makes a total of 75 connection. But when the applications have run a curtain amount of time. The total connection count is starting to exceed the max connections of postgresql.p  pWhen I look what kind of connections are still open, they are all idle. Does any one know a solution, or maybe some pointer p
Negative 1177 pNot sure if this is just me, but I cant seem to get the context menu to work on an option element child of a select element within IE.

So I think the event might not even exist in IEp

Negative 1177 pWhen using autolayout, my understanding is that removing a subview  while holding a reference to it of course, the removed subview still knows its autolayout constraints. p  pHowever, when adding it back to the super view later, the subview no longer knows its frame size.  Rather it seems to get a zero frame. p  pI assumed that autolayout would auto size it to meet the constraints. Is that not the case  I thought auto layout meant dont mess with frame rects. Do I still need to set the initial frame rect when adding the subview, even with auto layoutp

Negative 1177 pI am writing a PHPbased website one of which tasks involves accepting a zip file containing images sent by a user, unzipping it and creating thumbnails for each unzipped image. Since doing this onthefly with PHP would be really painful the server machine is slow, and PHP itself is not the fastest language out there I have come up with a solution using C with ImageMagick to handle the images. The C program is notified by PHP through Unix Sockets that there is a new job coming. The C program itself has 4 child processes, each being a task handler capable of unzipping the archive and handling the images. A problem has arisen, however this image resizing takes up so much CPU that the system literally freezes. Even one instance of the program consumes more than 50, and if there are many concurrent processes the system just becomes irresponsive. The system load generated by just one process is acceptable, although the whole system becomes quite inefficient then, since only one task can be processed at a time therefore I would like to have at least three concurrent processes.p  pNow I want to ask the actual question is there a not overly complicated way to set a limit on the CPU usage by a process, or should I try something else And if I manage to set the limit, doesnt it defeat the point of concurrency Maybe I should be using a more efficient library although I think ImageMagick is not a bad choice, is it If not that, what other solutions could you suggestp  pNote the system is a 32bit Ubuntu 12.04.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1177 pIm attempting to put multiple D3 force layouts on a page at the same time. The number of force layouts is ideally variable, depending on the number of roots returned from a dynamic API. I have followed the answers a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13650377multipleinstancesofd3forcelayoutonthesamepageon this question regarding multiple force layoutsa and have successfully put each layout in a separate div, in a separate svg.p  pHowever, the issue is twofoldp  p1 The svgs seem to be drawn at the same time, causing conflicts in the alpha cooling parameter on tick of each graph. Thus, the only layout that is positioned the way it is intended is the last svg drawn on the page. The tick function contains code that shapes the force layout similar to a weeping willow tree, with the root node sitting on top and the children falling below it.p  p2 Setting a loop to iterate on the full results list from the API causes D3 to crash, and an error Uncaught TypeError Cannot read property textContent of null.p  pI think the ideal solution would be to draw each force layout after the previous one has been successfully rendered, in a way that does not cause the alpha cooling parameters on tick to conflict, or overloading the D3 library with too many instances of the force layout at once. Does someone have insight into this issue Here is my codep  precode ...

As the route does not exist, a codeMethodNotAllowedHttpExceptioncode is thown.p  pNow, the question is why does this happen While pressing the submit button makes the login, hitting the enter key results in the error above.p  pI would like an actual solution to the problem, as well as an explanation of it, not patches like codee.preventDefaultcode on keypress or codereturn falsecode in js.p  pNote sammy is initialized correctly, the form is in the container on which sammy works and submitting using the enter key used to work in a previous version of the site. A lot has changed by now, so reverting is not a good option, so I would like an actual suggestion on how to solve the problem.p  pThanksp

I can tell that the view at least knows how much data is there, because my DOM has a codeko composecode element for each widget. For example, the first column has a handful of widgets, and that div gets created with a handful of widgets in it. Column 2 has 2 widgets, and it gets 2 codecomposecode elements. Column 3 has 1 widget and gets one element. Its just not displaying the widgets themselves. Do I need additional elements or additional binding somewherep  pI have a working model of this that doesnt rely on nested loops. Instead of using the array of objects, it just creates each of the observable arrays. In other words, its not looping. Instead of one array containing three objects, each with its own array, I have three arraysp  precodethis.column1Widgets this.column2Widgets this.column3Widgets codepre  pTheyre constructed the same way, just manually instead of looping. And the View looks more like thisp  precodeltdiv class3columnStylegt     lt ko foreach column3Widgets gt         lt ko compose data gtlt ko gt     lt ko gt ltdivgt ltdiv class3columnStylegt     lt ko foreach column3Widgets gt         lt ko compose data gtlt ko gt     lt ko gt ltdivgt ltdiv class3columnStylegt     lt ko foreach column3Widgets gt         lt ko compose data gtlt ko gt     lt ko gt ltdivgt codepre  pIm not sure why its not working with the nested loop, but since the data is identical, Im sure theres something Im missing in setting up the View. p
Negative 1177 pIm building an iOS app that allows users to upload photos to an upload folder on my server and send them to their friends. Right now I have the permissions on the uploads folder set to 773 write, execute are on for World but read is not. This allows users to upload photos from the app successfully into this folder and also allows them to view them later provided they have the direct URL for that particular folder which they do because the app handles that.p  pWhat Im afraid of is someone getting into the uploads folder and being able to viewdownload every photo in it.p  pSo one of my first instincts was to create a PHP page that uses readfile to dump the contents of whatever photo the user is asking for once Ive verified that it is indeed the user who tookuploaded the photo or one of their friends trying to view it.p  pBut, I thought, doesnt this put extra strain on the serverp  pIn short, Im asking if directly downloading a photo using its URL on my server is in any way more efficient than a readfile dump.p

Negative 1177 pAt the moment I have only one master branch which represents the current development status of the project. I want to add two features to the release version which is several commits behind on the master branch, release it, and then merge only the changes from the features into the current development version master branch. My idea was the followingp  ol liCheck out an older commit from the master branch into a separate release branch.li liCreate a feature branch from the release branch created in 1.li liAdd the features, commit them to the feature branch.li liApply only the changes from the feature branch to the development branch.li liMerge the feature branch with the release branch and delete it.li ol  pAssuming that the current release version is 1.5, I would create version 1.6 in the release branch and dont touch it after adding the features. Only the changes, which would be mainly additional files in form of separate classes, would be merged into the development branch for version 2.0. I want to do it this way, because the code base between 1.5 and 2.0 has radically changed and theyre basically unmergeable at this point.p  pIs this the correct and easiest way to accomplish my goal Which specific commands  git functions are necessary to get through all steps I already thought about using codegit flowcode for our future development to make use cases like this one easier, but Im not really sure if it isnt too complicated and redundant for our simple needs.p

Perhaps this temporary is automatically defined as constbr I am indeed passing a temporary, but the temporary is a wrapper for an actual nonconst lvalue and should be allowed to change freely.p  pIs there a way to tell Clang to relax these constraintsbr Is it somehow possible to tell the compiler that these headers are coming from a C98 library and thus should handle temporaries like in C98 Something akin to doing codeextern Ccodebr Is there a way to allow conversion of the temporary to an lvalue.p  pOf course, I can write codeauto bareccode and pass codebcode instead, but that fills up the code with a bunch of named temporaries and beats the purpose of the wrapper classes.p

Negative 1177 pMy understanding is such that p  pBDD is the process of evaluating how software needs to behave, and then writing acceptance tests on which to base your code.

When the code is written, you test it to see that is satisfies the original acceptance test. p  pCan anyone with experience of the entire comment on my interpretation and give a walk through of a simple application using these Agile principles I see there is plenty of text on BDD and TDD in separate publications, but I am looking at how the two processes complement one another in real world development.p

Negative 1177 pMy issue is quite annoying because i cant get any grip on how to fix it. p  pThe basic idea is that i created a sky sphere which is successfully rendered and moves with the camera position. The rendering of the sky sphere is done by turning of Z buffering and after that turning it back on, and the movement of the sky is done by translating its world matrix by the camera position values. p  pWhen i move the camera implicitly the sky dome really long distances, lets say code1000000.0fcode units on the DeptzZ axis, the sky sphere starts to change its shape... and it gets worse with longer distances... p  pI checked to see if its not something with the texture rendering by switching on the WIREFRAME, and i can see that basically the polygons of the sphere are changing. p  pAnybody having some ideas  Thank you.p
Negative 1177 pIs there an efficient algorithm efficient in terms of big O notation to find number of swaps to convert a permutation P into identity permutation I The swaps do not need to be on adjacent elements, but on any elements.p  pSo for examplep  precodeI  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, number of swaps is 0 P  0, 1, 5, 3, 4, 2, number of swaps is 1 2 and 5 P  4, 1, 3, 5, 0, 2, number of swaps is 3 2 with 5, 3 with 5, 4 with 0 codepre  pOne idea is to write an algorithm like thisp  precodeint count  0 forint i  0 i lt n  i      for P[i]  i  count   could be permuted multiple times         stdswapP[P[i]], P[i]          look where the number at hand should be       codepre  pBut it is not very clear to me whether that is actually guaranteed to terminate or whether it finds a correct number of swaps. It works on the examples above. I tried generating all permutation on 5 and on 12 numbers and it always terminates on those.p  pThis problem arises in numerical linear algebra. Some matrix decompositions use pivoting, which effectively swaps row with the greatest value for the next row to be manipulated, in order to avoid division by small numbers and improve numerical stability. Some decompositions, such as the LU decomposition can be later used to calculate matrix determinant, but the sign of the determinant of the decomposition is opposite to that of the original matrix, if the number of permutations is odd.p  pstrongEDITstrong I agree that this question is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7797540countingtheswapsrequiredtoconvertonepermutationintoanotherCounting the swaps required to convert one permutation into anothera. But I would argue that this question is more fundamental. Converting permutation from one to another can be converted to this problem by inverting the target permutation in On, composing the permutations in On and then finding the number of swaps from there to identity. Solving this question by explicitly representing identity as another permutation seems suboptimal. Also, the other question had, until yesterday, four answers where only a single one by ad was seemingly useful, but the description of the method seemed vague. Now user lizusek provided answer to my question there. I dont agree with closing this question as duplicate.p  pstrongEDIT2strong The proposed algorithm actually seems to be rather optimal, as pointed out in a comment by user rcgldr, see my answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7797540countingtheswapsrequiredtoconvertonepermutationintoanother2291619222916192Counting the swaps required to convert one permutation into anothera.p
Negative 1177 pI am having a hard time adding a codeUISearchDisplayControllercode to my app. The situation is this The primary navigation in the app takes place by scrolling between codeUITableViewControllerscode whose table views are all subviews of a codeUIScrollViewcode. Each of these has a codeUISearchDisplayControllercode for searching the contents within each codeUITableViewcode.p  pI also have a codeUIViewcode outside of the codeUIScrollViewcode which takes up the entire width of the screen and 85 pixels of the height, located at the very top of the interface. This acts as a kind of codeUINavigationBarcode, but due to the very custom nature of this element, I have made it a subclass of codeUIViewcode.p  pMy problem is that when you activate the codeUISearchBarcode, I want the navigation bar to move off the screen and the codeUISearchBarcode to take its place like in the native Mail app where tapping the search field hides the navigation bar. It seems to me like I not only have to manually hide the navigation bar but also expand the size of the codeUIScrollViewcode and all of its nested codeUITableViewscode in order to achieve this.p  pI am still a novice, so I am completely puzzled as to how to do this. Is there a simple solution or do I have to do this all manually andor restructure my code in order to create the desired effectp

Negative 1177 pIm tryn to create a custom form field of type text or list where a user can a type free text andor b select from dropdown. Now I found many posts about autocomplete or autofill, but thats not what Im after.  I followed the example on how to create a City Custom field here a hrefhttpdocs.joomla.orgJ2.53aHowtoaddcustomfilterstocomponents relnofollowhttpdocs.joomla.orgJ2.5Howtoaddcustomfilterstocomponentsa and this is all working.  However, it creates a dropdown only, no option to enter text.p  pIm new to the Joomla 3.x component development, so maybe I am missing something very  simple here. With all those field types available, its hard to belief there is no dropdown with free input.p  pSo   1. can I make the default selectlist to accept free text  2. if not, can I get a pointer on how to get started making one my self  3. For now, it would be fine to have 10 city names listed, and free input, no need to filter the city list while typing. But ultimately, I would like to know on how to create a filter while typing Ajax version of this.

Negative 1177 pIn compiling some isolated tests to compare the ability of compilers to do devirtualization of simple single inheritance cases, versus CRTP, and versus inlining of C style table of function pointers I noticed I appear to be getting more promising results from the latter Testing using MSVC20102013 amp XCode5Clang.p  pSo given modern compilers ability to remove redundant copy by values and infer optimisation by value, it appears that even if you have large C style tables of function pointers in a struct it might be better to prefer passing them by value as a general rule these days.

Negative 1177 pI have a stored procedure, let us call it emspAem which calls other stored procedures, let us call them emspBem and emspCem. For the sake of consistency an emXA TRANSATCIONem is started within emspAem. What I actually want to do is to log if the execution of emspBem or emspCem fails and if so, which were the arguments passed to the failing stored procedure. But as emspBem and emspCem do some inserts in some tables, I need to do a emXA ROLLBACKem if emspBem or emspCem fails.p  pSo my question is strongHow can I log into a table while I am within a transaction or how to execute an insert statement outside of the transaction scopestrongp  pTo give you a little example of what I want to do Ive simplyfied the code and renamed most of the parametersvariables used to focus on the problem, I would never dream of using parameter names like emaem, embem or emcem  p  pThe stored procedure emspAem looks like thisp  precodeCREATE PROCEDURE spA    IN a INT,   IN b VARCHAR64,   OUT c INT  splabelBEGIN   DECLARE lerrorMessage TEXT   DECLARE lspSuccess INT   DECLARE lerrorOccured INT DEFAULT 0   DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION BEGIN     SET lerrorOccured  1   END    XA START spA    CALL spBa, b, lspSuccess    IF lerrorOccured OR lspSuccessResult lt 0 THEN     XA END spA     XA ROLLBACK spA     SET c  1     SET lerrorMessage  CONCATCALL spB, a, , , b, , lspSuccess     CALL spLoglerrorMessage     LEAVE splabel   END IF    CALL spCa, b, lspSuccess    IF lerrorOccured OR lspSuccessResult lt 0 THEN     XA END spA     XA ROLLBACK spA     SET c  2     SET lerrorMessage  CONCATCALL spC, a, , , b, , lspSuccess     CALL spLoglerrorMessage     LEAVE splabel   END IF    XA END spA   XA COMMIT spA   SET c  1 END codepre  pThe stored procedure emspBem looks like this emspCem looks similarp  precodeCREATE PROCEDURE spB    IN a INT,   IN b VARCHAR64,   OUT c INT  splabelBEGIN   DECLARE lerrorMessage TEXT   DECLARE lspSuccess INT   DECLARE lerrorOccured INT DEFAULT 0   DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION BEGIN     SET lerrorOccured  1   END    INSERT INTO someTable a, b VALUES a, b    IF lerrorOccured THEN     SET c  1     SET lerrorMessage  CONCATINSERT INTO someTable a, b VALUES , a, , , b,      CALL spLoglerrorMessage     LEAVE splabel   END IF    SET c  1 END codepre  pemspLogem just inserts data into a table which I want to use as my emlogging tableem.p  pSo actually the logging within emspAem works just fine because the call to emspLogem is outside a transaction but the logging within emspBem or emspCem wont work because by rolling back the transaction started in emspAem, the inserts done by the call of emspLogem within emspBem or emspCem are reverted of course.p  pI have simplified the example, in emspBem and emspCem. There is more going on than just one simple insert statement and just to have more fun, there are transactions started and commitedrolled back within emspBem and emspCem as well.p  pI would appreciate any hints you could give me.

Say for example the select label takes up 5 lines then the select should be lined up so it appears to be on the same vertical level as teh 3rd line in the label side by side.  If the label text is one line high then the label and the select are vertically on the same level.  If the label text is 2 lines high then the select should appear to be on a level between the two lines.pli lipFor text areas the label text is vertically centred with the text area and the text area is vertically centered with the label.  Say the text area is 5 lines high and the label is one line hight then the label should appear to be level with the 3rd line in the text area.  Say the text area is 2 lines high and the label is 4 lines high then the text area should line level with the middle 2 lines in the label.pli lipFor text box similar to item 1, with the text box lining up with middle line in the label.pli ol  pHTMLp  precode    ltdiv classfieldSetgtltfieldsetgt      ltpgt       ltlabel classfield fornamegtNameltlabelgt       ltinput idname typetext namename classtextbox gt      ltpgt             ltpgt       ltlabel classfield forlifegtLife Numberltlabelgt       ltinput idlife typetext namelife classtextbox stylewidth85pxgt       ltlabel classfield forannualgtAnnual Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Numberltlabelgt       ltinput idannual typetext nameannual classtextbox stylewidth85pxgt       ltlabel classfield formaleFemale stylewidth125pxgtMFltlabelgt       ltinput idmaleFemale typetext namemaleFemale classtextbox stylewidth40pxgt      ltpgt      ltpgt       ltlabel classfield forrunYesNogtRunning, YesNoltlabelgt       ltselect namerunYesNo idrunYesNogt        ltoption value selectedgtYesNoltoptiongt        ltoption value YesgtYesltoptiongt        ltoption value NogtNoltoptiongt       ltselectgt      ltpgt      ltpgt       ltlabel classfield forpredMinsgtPredicted 5km blah blah blah blah blah blahltlabelgt       ltinput idpredMins typetext namepredMins classtextbox stylewidth85pxgt       ltlabel classfield forpredSecsgtSecondsltlabelgt       ltinput idpredSecs typetext namepredSecs classtextbox stylewidth85pxgt      ltpgt      ltpgt       ltlabel classfield forhelpOutgtBlah Blah Blah Blah are you Available to Assist  Help Out  Officiate  Steward on the Night, YesNoltlabelgt       ltselect namehelpOut idhelpOutgt        ltoption value selectedgtYesNoltoptiongt        ltoption value YesgtYesltoptiongt        ltoption value NogtNoltoptiongt       ltselectgt      ltpgt      ltpgt       ltlabel classfield forcommentsgtCommentsltlabelgt       lttextarea idcomments namecomments  ROWS10 WRAPSOFT gtComments go here.......lttextareagt      ltpgt     ltfieldsetgtltdivgt codepre  pCSSp  precodeform  display block  width800px  marginleft auto  marginright auto  textalign center  padding0   div.fieldSet   width798px  marginleft auto  marginright auto   fieldset  border none  margin 0px 0px 0px 0px  padding 0px 0px 15px 0px   legend  width 100  padding 0px  textalign center  label.field  textalign right  width 190px  floatleft  verticalalign middle   input.textbox  width 560px  float left  height 25px  verticalalign middle  fieldset p  clear both  verticalalign middle  textalign  left  textarea   width560px  select   width270px  displayblock  float left  codepre  pI would appreciate advise on how to achieve the layout that I am looking for.p  pThank you for reading this. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comS2KUv.jpg altThis picture quotBEFOREquot is what I get with the above CSSp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0wglU.jpg altThis is what I want to achieve, quotAFTERquot changes to the CSSp

Negative 1177 pI have a c dll that needs to send a quite complex object over the network to an unmanaged c process.  Im aware that there are a number of ways to do this but was wondering if anyone can recommend the best fit.  Important points to notep  ol liIt is critical that the c process is informed if data is not received by the c process. Preferably Id like as reliable a method of transferring the data as possible.li liUnfortunately Im also under pressure to deliver the packets as quickly as possible so ultimately some trade off will be required between reliability and performance.li liThe c object that represents the data is likely to change. This is a third party object which we have no control over. Ideally Id require some dynamic mechanism in the c process to handle these changes with as minimal impact as possible. Worst case scenario would be if we have to recompile the code everytime the object data changes.li liId rather avoid using third party libraries if possible.li ol  hr  pAny help would be much appreciated.p

Negative 1177 pIm running a hurdle type analysis on species distribution data which involves two fitting steps. The first step is to model m1 presenceabsence data using all data with familyquasibinomial. The second step m2 is to use positive presence only data with familyGamma. This works wonderfully until I try to predict using the second model m2 on the full dataset I receive an error due to new factor levels. I understand why I am receiving this error there are factor levels that appear in the full dataset that are not present in the reduce presence only dataset. My question is how do I work around this error so that I can get predictions using the second model on the full set  I am using mgcv. p  pEdit Updated with additional code and data. p  precode  Step1

Negative 1177 pI have a Simulink model, the purpose of which is automated code generation. p  pMy model uses Sfunctions developed by another party, which has hardcoded assumptions about the path. For instance, several external data files are needed, which are referenced in the Sfunction via a relative path like code..Bindatadatafile.bincode. This makes it necessary to set MATLABs current working directory to a specific path before the model can be run. p  pI can automatically check and set the correct path via model callback functions. However, all model callback functions only seem to be related to the simulation process, not the build process. That means that I can emrunem the model irrespective of what directory Im in, but when I try to embuildem the model, it always fails unless I manually navigate MATLAB back to the correct directory. p  pNeedless to say, thats quite annoying. So I was wondering if there is something like a preBuildFcn callback fnuction, a function that is run before starting the build process Any other solution that does not involve modifying the Sfunction is also very welcome. p

One of the columns in it uses the codeSTUFFcode function.  p  pWhen I run the query in a SQL editor window, the resulting value looks like thisp  precode1234 codepre  pWhen I try to use this query in an SSRS report, SSRS automatically puts a column alias within the codeSTUFFcode function, resulting in a value that looks like thisp  precodeltExpr1gt, 1ltExpr1gtltExpr1gt, 2ltExpr1gtltExpr1gt, 3ltExpr1gtltExpr1gt, 4ltExpr1gt codepre  pThe only difference between the two is that when I save the query in SSRS, the term AS Expr1 is added automatically see code below. p  pHow can I prevent SSRS from adding this alias automatically and run the query as it is  p  precode   SELECT          FirstName,          LastName,          CourseTitle,         LastLoginDate,         NoOfModules,         COUNTCourseCompleted AS ModulesStarted,         STUFF                        SELECT ,   CASTCourseModule AS varchar20  SSRS puts AS Expr1 here             FROM EDSF              WHERE                  FirstName  e.FirstName AND                  LastName  e.LastName AND                  Coursecompleted  1 AND                  CourseTitle  e.CourseTitle             FOR XML PATH           ,1,1,           AS CoursesCompleted     FROM EDSF  e     WHERE          Coursecompleted  1 OR          Coursecompleted  0     GROUP BY          FirstName,          LastName,          CourseTitle,         LastLoginDate,         NoOfModules codepre  pEDIT the code has been rearranged and the question reworded to make the issue clearer.  Im NOT having a problem aliasing the returned column itself instead, SSRS is actually adding an alias to the subquery within my codeSTUFFcode function, resulting in extra junk within the field itself. p
Negative 1177 pI wanted to ask that is there a way by which I can append a div and an image inside it using javascript p  pSo basiclly, images are stored in an array. strongdisplayAllImagesstrong function appends the images to the div strongimagesstrong but I want that function should append a strongdivstrong and within the new div there should be the strongimagestrong may be as a strongbackgroundstrong or an strongimage contained in a divstrong. This should repeat for all images as in strong3 images should be display as 3 divs containing 3 different imageselements of the arraystrong. Try to stick to array implementation only.

My goal is  partially, to open a given text file, containing numbers, one number and nothing else in each row . I need to read these eventually into the array called station[n]. To do this, I put a int array between the File and the destination station array.  The station array, is a struct, Im not allowed to change that. The goal is to read the numbers from the text file, into the data array, then put them accordingly from there into the station array.p  pThe trick is that the station array has 3 qualities for each element station[1] for instance has to have a distance, arrivetime, and departtime all positive integers. Which also means that the number of stations will be equal to the number of rows in the text file divided by 3.p  pI suspect that this can probably be done without the data array, but even so, my code gets stuck at the very beginning it cannot read the file properly at all. Ive read a few articles on this forum as well as others, none helped.... The code above is a partial only, please consider any undeclared element, accordingly declared somewhere in my main code.p  pThanks for the helpp

Negative 1177 pIm working on writing a simple chatting serverclient C program using epoll. Im writing and testing it in Xubuntu, and I found something strange. Message from server to client is delivered well. But Message from client to server is delivered at the moment when I push enter key at SERVER SIDEputty window For example, if I type Hello World in the client window and push enter key, the message doesnt show on the server side, however, when I push enter key on the server side, Hello World shows on the window I think something is wrong in server.c but I cant find whats wrong. I used epoll and let it monitor EPOLLINEPOLLOUT to receive and send messages. In other hand, I wrote client program with multithreading. Full src are below without header.

Negative 1177 pI am relatively new to ruby and I am stuck with this problem which is rather hard to solve.p  pWhat I want to achieve is that I could catch custom errors which I throw from the sub class in a parent class.

Negative 1177 pHow do you determine the name of a custom field in jirapythonp  pWhen I retrieve an issue, my custom fields show up as customfieldxxxp  pThe names on my screen are project, name, due date, etc. Short of putting a value in each field, then seeing where it appears when I reread the issue.p  pThat is I can put a in one of my fields, then read the issue, and find that customfield10801 or whatever has the value a.  But is there a general way to find, for example, if my custom field is due date, which customfieldxxx does it get mapped top  pOr, in the JIRA GUI, how would I look up these customfield s.p

Negative 1177 pSo I have two EditText views on the layout, and whenever I change one of them the TextChanged event for that view is called and calculates the result then displays it on the other EditText view. The problem is when I put another TextChanged listener for the other one the program crashes whenever I change text from either of the two EditText views.

Negative 1177 pIm trying out the strongema hrefhttphofmannsven.com2013laboratorysvgstacking relnofollowSVG stacking techniqueaemstrong to enable multiple icons stacked in a single file, requiring only a single HTTP request from the browser.  The technique is described pretty thoroughly a hrefhttphofmannsven.com2013laboratorysvgstacking relnofollowstrongherestronga.p  pBasically the idea is that you put multiple SVG elements into a single SVG file, and use CSS styling to hide all icons, except for the icon you currently want to display.  You select the icon you currently want to display using the CSS codetargetcode selector.p  pThe technique works for me, except stacking multiple icons causes weird distortions in the displayed icon, even though all other icons are hidden.p  pIn the example Im working with, I simplified this to stacking only emtwoem icons an US flag icon and an UK flag icon.p  pThe simplified SVG file isp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8 standalonenogt  ltsvg idsvg153 xmlnsrdfhttpwww.w3.org19990222rdfsyntaxns xmlnshttpwww.w3.org2000svg height480 width640 version1.1 xmlnscchttpcreativecommons.orgns xmlnsdchttppurl.orgdcelements1.1gt      ltsvgstyle          xmlnssvghttpwww.w3.org2000svg typetextcssgt         .i  display none          .itarget  display block      ltsvgstylegt      ltsvgsvg iduk xmlnssvghttpwww.w3.org2000svg class  i height480 width640 version1.1gt        lt SVG elements to draw UK flag gt     ltsvgsvggt      ltsvgsvg idus xmlnssvghttpwww.w3.org2000svg class  i height480 width640 version1.1gt        lt SVG elements to draw US flag gt      ltsvgsvggt ltsvggt codepre  pNote that the CSS is embedded within the SVG file, in a codeltsvgstylegtcode element.  The CSS is simply p  precode.i  display none  .itarget  display block  codepre  pThis way, any codesvgsvgcode element with codeclassicode is automatically invisible, unless we specifically target it in the SVG url. So this way, to display a US flag icon, I would use the following HTML snippetp  precodeltimg      srcflags.svgus      width80      height60      altSVG Stacked Image  gt codepre  pAnd of course, to display the UK flag I would change it to codesrcflags.svgukcodep  pAnyway, all of this works wonderfully... except for a strange image distortion which occurs in both Firefox and Chrome when I stack the images.p  pHeres a screenshot of the US flag when I remove the hidden UK flag from the SVG filep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comB1s0j.png altUS flag icon without distortionp  pAs you can see, it looks fine.p  pBut when I stack it in front of the UK flag, it looks likep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comL9odp.png altUS flag icon with distortionp  pAs you can see, the image becomes strangely distorted  it almost looks like what happens to a lowquality JPEG when you get a lot of artifacts in the compressed image.p  pSo why exactly is this happening  The other images stacked with the US flag icon are all invisible, so why should they effect the visible icon at allp  pI Googled around a lot looking for answers, and although there are definitely many issues and gotchas with the SVG stacking technique, they all relate to crossbrowser compatibility. However, the technique works fine on most newer browsers up to and including IE9. Also, the distortion happens in both Firefox emandem Chrome, so this isnt likely to be some crossbrowser issue, but rather something Im doing wrong.p  pSo, what is causing this weird distortion when I apply the SVG stacking techniquep

Negative 1177 pBeing fairly new to C and OOP Im having some newbie problems with scope and access, one of them being this When the main form loads an instance of the class Doc is created and the constructor opens a Word document and creates a list of all the images in the document. The first image in the list is displayed in a picturebox, like sop  precodepublic partial class Form1  Form      public Form1          InitializeComponent           public class Doc          public ListltImagegt images  new ListltImagegt         public Docstring path               Open Word document, create list of images                    private void Form1Loadobject sender, EventArgs e          Doc doc  new DocCloremipsum.doc         pictureBox1.Image  doc.images[0]           private void numericUpDown1ValueChangedobject sender, EventArgs e          pictureBox1.Image   doc.images[numericUpDown1.Value]       codepre  pThere is also a numericUpDown control which should be used to display different images, and thats where the problem is. The last block of code in the example above doesnt work, but I hope it illustrates what I want to do.p  pWhat would be a best practice solution to this problem and similar ones where one control should be able to access objects created by other controls I have also tried to solve it by creating a method for the Doc class but had problems accessing the picturebox from there instead.p

Negative 1177 pScenario Integrating external web application with secure information.  Web site calls BizTalk WCF service with one or more fields that have been encrypted with web sites encryption class.  Inside the publish map I need to convert the web encryption to BizTalk environment encryption  yes, the differences are necessary.  This used to be done in the SOAP asmx web service data types code but now needs to be done either in the map or pipeline.  Map seemed easiest to implement with scripting functoid reference to external assembly where I call decryptor for the one and reencrypt with the other pretty much exactly like I did in old web service.p  pProblem  External assembly is relatively simple in that it consists of one class with default constructor no arguments, with one public method the takes a string and returns a string.  Input is web encrypted valve, output is my encryption value.  I reference 3 custom libraries for this encryption swap inside the method. None of the referenced assemblies are being called from the scripting functoid.  All are added as references in map project. All are strongnamed.  All are GACd.p  pYet, when I test the map it gives the following error p  blockquote   pFunction ScriptNS0Myfunction has failed. Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation. Could not load file or assembly OurCompany.Project.WebEncryption, Version1.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyToken123654789abcd or one of its dependencies.

In other words we know that an object will be created when using the MKDirections class so, why not call it class.p  pSorry if my question doesnt make any sense but Im curious if there is something I should be aware when reading the documentation and I come across these two different references, is there something special on the classes they describe as objectsp  pThanksp

Negative 1177 pI have a larger application which automates several data aggregation tasks for an enduser. Im wrapping this application with a webbased interface using codeFlaskcode. Both of these applications are wrapped and joined with a codeMongoDBcode backend via a codeDockercode container.p  pThe endgoal is for the user to start and monitor tasks via the web frontend storing the ongoing process information in the MongoDB instance. p  pWhat Im missing is the glue between the codeFlaskcode frontend and my own backend. I need a method for starting a process from a web request, storing and monitoring that process, and administering that process from subsequent web requests starting, stopping, etc.. p  pNote This particular application will run a max of two or three processes at once and needs to stay within the confines of being able to run on a docker instance with limited memoryCPU the backend code simply makes web requests and aggregates data. Therefore, codeCelerycode as prescribed in an answer from a similar question is not ideal as its far too bloated for the simple implementation I need.p

For example, on cache miss event the CPU switches a thread. but what if the scheduler doesnt want to switch the thread how do they agree on one action p  pIm really confused between the two who schedules a thread the OS or the CPUp  pthanks alot p

Ive played with dataType, contentType etc, have changed the method back and forward from GET to POST, and have even tried supplying data in different formats.p  pThe PHP executes fine, and switching the method to GET lets me see the correct response but the rest of the page is still duplicating inside my container p  pCode is as followsp  pThe formp  precode        ltphp           Handle form if a submission is detected         requireonceABSPATH .

Negative 1177 pIm trying to figure out how to inject runtime arguments into a singleton  when it is created, and then have those arguments just be remembered from then on. Im not sure if the interface for runtime arguments can support this, though. Say, for example, I have a Client object that requires a token, and has the following initializerp  precode instancetypeinitWithTokenNSString token codepre  pThe token is obtained at runtime from the server and is different for every user, so I cant simply put the NSString in the definition. So I create the following method on my Typhoon assemblyp  precode Client clientWithTokenNSString token codepre  pHowever, in the future when Im injecting this client into other classes, I wont have the token on hand to call this method with. So I would like to just be able to inject code[self client]code, for example. Since the client is a singleton and has already been created, the token isnt necessary, anyway.p  pHowever, I cant seem to find a way to do this. Obviously, defining a separate method called codeclientcode would just return a different client. Can I just call codeclientWithTokennilcode and the argument will be ignored if the client already exists Perhaps traversing the assemblys codesingletonscode array would work, but that is obviously very inelegant.p  pI have considered injecting by type so I dont need a method to call, but I have multiple different clients of the same type, so I need to be explicit about which client to inject. Of course, there is also the option of removing this parameter from the initializer, and instead setting it as a property from outside the assembly however this pattern is used throughout our application, so I would like to avoid rewriting that much code.p  pThank you.p

Negative 1177 pI have an assignment to create my own implementation of a class to handle integers of unlimited size, and then to compare my implementations runtime to that of Javas BigInteger.

After a second or so the user can click on the banner and will be taken to a URL or if they wait until the end of the animation, there will be a CTA that will take them to said URL.p  pIssue When the user clicks on the interactive element at the beginning of the animation, theyre taken to the destination URL In DoubleClick terms the codeexitcode prematurely.p  pAttempts DoubleClick cant recognize the exit event in Flash. We originally set it up where the exit event shows up at the end in Flash, but couldnt get the exit event to register in DoubleClick after converting it via Swiffy.p  pUnfortunately I cant post the JavaScript as it contains confidential material. Besides, Swiffy produces a long list of garbled code.p  pQuestion How can I get the codeexitcode event to show up after the initial interactive element has been clicked This has to be done in a way that adheres to DoubleClick standardspractices.p

Negative 1177 pI am in the midst of an initiative to convert our build.gradle files to use semantic versions. In addition to using Gradle, we also use Git and are following the Gitflow Workflow. Jenkins is used to build the projects.p  pVersions for released artifacts follow a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format. When declaring dependencies in the build.gradle file, we use dynamic versions, such as 10.0. i.e. take the latest 10.0.PATCH version.p  pWe promote our artifacts from a Release Candidates repository to a Releases repository in Nexus. The repository has its policy set to Releases. Because of the complexity of the product 200 projects, with many upstream and downstream dependencies, a lot of the promotion plugins available for Jenkins appear to fall short. We were thinking of having Jenkins build the master branch as a way to rename artifacts 10.0.0rc.1abcdefg becomes 10.0.0 and upload them to the correct Nexus repository.p  pI am unsure of how to handle a situation where an upstream dependency has a patch version incremented. The downstream project  a WAR  is rebuilt by Jenkins and bundles the new JAR, but the version of the downstream project doesnt change. When an attempt is made to upload to Nexus, it fails because only one artifact can have the same version.p  pHere is an examplep  ul liThe Releases Nexus repository has upstreamapi versioned at 10.0.0, and downstreamproject versioned at 10.0.0li lidownstreamproject depends on 10.0. of upstreamapili liupstreamapi.jar is bundled into the downstreamproject.war fileli liThe two artifacts are deployed as part of Release X of the productli liWhen a hotfix branch has been merged into master, the upstreamapi version has changed to 10.0.1li liThe fix means that when deployed, the product is now Release Xli lidownstreamproject stays at 10.0.0, but is rebuilt because of the change in the upstream dependencyli liJenkins fails to upload downstreamproject10.0.0.war to Nexus because it already existsli ul  pI could have the old artifact replaced with the new artifact, but then that means that Release X can no longer be deployed from artifacts in Nexus eg. in the case of a rollback, or needing to replicate an issue on an older release.p  pHow is this typically handledp

Negative 1177 pI have some code that unpins and pins items from the task bar and start menu, which I run using Remoting, as a means of cleaning up lab machines between sessions. It works great, other than I need to log off and back on to see the changes. This is somewhat similar to another bit of code I have, which changes the icon of a shortcut in order to badge it as an updated file. That code also requires a refresh, but there I am able to use a technique I found a hrefhttppowershell.comcsmediap8322.aspx relnofollowherea...This does a refresh of Explorer and the desktop shortcut shows up correctly. However, the same code does not do a refresh of the task bar it seems. I also found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12669294powershellapplynewsettingstotaskbarthisa, which also seems to not impact the Taskbar.  Also, this is related to the Remoting, because when I run the same code locally no refresh is needed. So, curious if anyone knows a way to directly refresh the task bar and Start Menu via Remoting Or am I going to need to brute force it and just log the user offp

Negative 1177 pI have a simple batch program that works on 2 CentOS 6.6 machines  a 32 bit machine and a 64 bit machine , but not on a third CentOS 6.6 machine  a 64 bit machine .  So how can the exact same executable work on 2 machines, but not work on the third machinep  pNote that I am not asking how to fix this issue, I am asking how the same exact executable can behave differently on 3 different machines.  I actually have 3 or four different C programs that match this behavior, but I am choosing the simplest one to troubleshoot the issue.  My theory is that something is setup differently at the OS level between the 3 machines  maybe I forgot to install some library or set some environmental variable .  I just need help narrowing down where to look, what OS type things to look at.p  pThis probably should go onto serverfault, as it is more a server related question, but I was afraid people there would see my reference to C programs and ask me to come here, so I am going to start here.p  pNote that valgrind does not help.  I would just fix the issue in my code if that were the case, but it revealed no memory issues.  When I say it is simple, I mean it.  It just reads some records from the database, massages them, and then prints them to the screen.p  pThanks for any help you can provide.p

After a record in state codependingcode has been processed, it is updated to state codeprocessedcode.p  pIf the first codePlaycode instance queries the database for pending orders and while processing them the second codePlaycode instance runs the same query, it obtains a record set that consists also of pending orders already queried by the first codePlaycode instance but not processed yet. To avoid this, a codePlaycode instance should be able to invoke codedoSomethingcode if and only if there is no other instance that is already executing it.p  pI could implement a kind of DBbased semaphore where the first codePlaycode instance that acquires it sets the value of a field to code1code or whatever else... but this solution is not stable because if that codePlaycode instance fails and never sets back the field to code0code, then other codePlaycode instances are no longer able to acquire the semaphore and invoke codedoSomethingcode.p

Negative 1177 pI have a pretty simple or so I thought gulpfile for a web app I am writing, the main function moves all the files from the codesrccode directory to the codebuildcode directory, processing certain files along the way.

Negative 1177 pI am using the Google API in my application, but can only get the debug ssh to work the with Google API.  I have a keystore that I sign with, Ive done the same with previous apps in the past and have had no problem. Ive also enabled all the APIs. Im signing my app with a release apk. Im using the SSH1 from that release apk in the SSH1 for the Google API credential. Im using the Key from Google in my application. Ive read all all stack overflow and google docs on this, and have tried pretty much everything, but I cannot get it to work. It only works when I am debugging my app in which case I use the SSH1 generated by the debug keystore and the Key that I use with that SSH1. However, when I sign with my person release keystore and publish on Beta on the app store and download onto my phone, I get the error that my API key is invalid. Here are my manifest and build files as well as my layout file if that helps.
