Positive 81666 pMy app seems to be properly implemented on Android this gets the token for a specific project number as well as this subscribes the client to three different topics. The token wasnt sent to the server because it specified a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comcloudmessagingregistration relnofollowherea that for topics it is not needed, in server side, to have it.p  pThe app server can send out the messages to the GCM server and gets the ID for the message.

I already posted a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32826622gcmclientdoesnotreceivedownstreammessagesquestiona with some details about my problem.

Positive 81666 pI am using an indefinitely running service with its own process and an extension of GcmListenerService to receive push messages. The push messages will initiate an operation within the service. The problem is, that if the app is closedremoved from the recently used app, the service is still running, but will stop immediately if a new message is received. The process list shows that first the background process is terminated and then a usual application process starts without any processing of the push message.p  pAndroidManifest.xmlp  precodeltapplication androidallowBackupfalse androidlabelstringappname     androidicondrawableicon androidthemestyleAppTheme     androidprocessdomain.android.Application     androidname.Applicationgt     ltreceiver         androidnamecom.google.android.gms.gcm.GcmReceiver         androidexportedtrue         androidpermissioncom.google.android.c2dm.permission.SEND gt         ltintentfiltergt             ltaction androidnamecom.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE gt             ltcategory androidnamedomain.android gt         ltintentfiltergt     ltreceivergt      ltservice         androidname.service.MyGcmListenerService         androidexportedfalse gt         ltintentfiltergt             ltaction androidnamecom.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE gt         ltintentfiltergt     ltservicegt      ltservice         androidname.service.BackgroundService         androidicondrawableicon         androidlabelstringservicename         androidprocessdomain.android.service.BackgroundService         androidexportedfalse         androidenabledtruegt ltapplicationgt codepre  pThe GCM listenerp  precodepublic class MyGcmListenerService extends GcmListenerService       Override     public void onMessageReceivedString from, Bundle data          String code  data.getStringcode         if j.equalscode              final String id  data.getStringid, null             String status  data.getStringstatus, null              Intent serviceIntent  new IntentgetBaseContext, domain.android.service.BackgroundService.class             serviceIntent.addFlagsIntent.FLAGRECEIVERFOREGROUND             serviceIntent.putExtramethod, push             serviceIntent.putExtraid, id             serviceIntent.putExtrastatus, status             serviceIntent.putExtranotificationId, new Date.getTime             startServiceserviceIntent                codepre  pThe servicep  precodepublic class BackgroundService extends Service      Override     public int onStartCommandIntent intent, int flags, final int startId          if intent.hasExtramethod               Start processing                   Override     public void onCreate          Intent notificationIntent  new Intentthis, Main.class         PendingIntent intent  PendingIntent.getActivitygetBaseContext, 0, notificationIntent, 0         android.app.Notification.Builder builder  new android.app.Notification.Builderthis             .setContentIntentintent             .setContentTitlegetTextR.string.appname                 .setContentTextConnected                 .setSmallIconR.drawable.markerwalkerwhite          android.app.Notification notification  builder.build         startForeground1, notification       codepre

Positive 81666 pI created a chrome web app.  The app simply opens my web site.  This is working as expected.  The app is available on the Chrome Web Store.  I am able to add it to Chrome.  The site was existing, so I simply added the url and launch properties in the manifest.json.  I am new to GCM altogether.  I am trying to configure code to send a notification or message to the web app using GCM.  I understand I need to add javascript code to register the app.  The documentation I am reading isnt as straight forward as I would like or understand.  I am a little confused at this part.  I added this to the manifest.json filep  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodebackground        scripts [scriptsmain.js]      codepre  pWhat is javascript code I would include in the main.js file to register the web app  Also, can someone tell me what or how that register function is called  The only files in my package are the manifest.json and main.js files.  Specific examples would be very much appreciated.p  pI do not need to do anything complex at this time.  I would simply like to test the GCM notification process to a Chrome Web App.  I also understand there is an application server component, but first want to make sure the Web App is configured correctly with the right files and code.p

Positive 81666 pI have GCM Google Cloud Messaging XMPP connection running with Android app clients and Ubuntu server. The server documentation a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comcloudmessagingccs relnofollowhttpsdevelopers.google.comcloudmessagingccsa discusses differences between release gcmxmpp.googleapis.com5235 and preproductions gcmpreprod.googleapis.com5236 GCM connections from server. However, the wording in the section states the messaging is routed from to the server according to the SENDERID rather than the URLport the server has registered atp  blockquote   pThe CCS XMPP endpoint runs at gcmxmpp.googleapis.com5235. When testing functionality with nonproduction users, you should instead connect to gcmpreprod.googleapis.com5236 note the different port. Regular testing on preprod a smaller environment where the latest CCS builds run is beneficial both for isolating real users from test code, as well as for early detection of unexpected behavior changes. Note that a connection receives upstream messages destined for its GCM sender ID, regardless of which environment gcm or gcmpreprod it is connected to. Therefore, test code connecting to gcmpreprod.googleapis.com5236 should use a different GCM sender ID to avoid upstream messages from production traffic being sent over test connections.p blockquote  pSince the SENDERID is the Project Number, does this imply I need to create a second version of the project with GCM enabled to run production and preproduction versions of my GCM 3rdp party server concurrentlyp

Positive 81666 pi finally succeede to recieve an gcm notification on my android app which was build using Livecode. Fortunately a good script was on their forum. This works ok, i can receive any text i like and the sound is there....but this script bites my own livecode stack, that it causes my stack to stop communicating with my database via php. The stack i made send a simple text file and at the same time the notifcation should be send out. So i wanted to do this also via php. Now i can send and receive the gcm notification. But there is no sound and the alternative text is not appearing, just Notification Recieved. Also in the Livecode gcm script there is Soundenabletrue used in the JSON part. And i cant find it anywere in any php script. Im not a php coder nor a JSON coder. So i hope someone can help me out.

Negative 81666 precodeltphp    My codebase is littered with the same conditionals over and over   again.  Im trying to refactor using inheritance and the Factory   pattern and Ive had some success but Im now stuck.     Im stuck because I want to derive a new class from the one   returned by the Factory.  But I cant do that, so Im obviously   doing something wrong somewhere else.        The old implementation was as follows.  Theres if statements   everywhere throughout both LayoutView and ItemIndexView and   SomeOtherView.   class LayoutView   class IndexView extends LayoutView   class SomeOtherView extends LayoutView       Below is the new implementation.  So far Ive managed to tidy   up LayoutView I think I have anyway.  But now Im stuck because   the way Ive tidied it up has left me not knowing how to extend   it.     For examples sake, lets say the conditions were relating to a   type of fish salmon or tuna.   abstract class LayoutView      protected function prepareHeader  echo METHOD, n      protected function prepareLeftHandSide  echo METHOD, n      protected function prepareFooter  echo METHOD, n      public function prepare          thisgtprepareHeader         thisgtprepareLeftHandSide         thisgtprepareFooter        class SalmonLayoutView extends LayoutView      protected function prepareLeftHandSide  echo METHOD, n    class TunaLayoutView extends LayoutView      protected function prepareLeftHandSide  echo METHOD, n      protected function prepareFooter  echo METHOD, n    class ViewFactory      public static function getLayoutViewfishType          switchthisgtfishType          case salmon             return new SalmonLayoutView             break         case tuna             return new TunaLayoutView             break                    Now LayoutView has been cleaned up and the condition that was once   scattered through every LayoutView method is now in one place.   view  ViewFactorygetLayoutView ConfiggetOptionfishtype  viewgtprepare     Now heres where Im stuck.  I want to effectively extend whatever   class view is an instance of.     The reason being, I wish to derive a view to show an index of   articles within the appropriate LayoutView.  The IndexView code is   the same for Salmon and Tuna.     I can do something like this    class SalmonIndexView extends SalmonLayoutView   class TunaIndexView extends TunaLayoutView       But then Ill be writing the same IndexView code twice.  What Id   like to do is something like this    view  ViewFactorygetLayoutView ConfiggetOptionfishtype  class IndexView extends getclassview       But Im pretty certain thats not possible, and even if it was   it seems very wrong.     Can someone more experienced in refactoring and OO please let   me know where Ive gone wrong and suggest a clean way to solve   this   codepre

Negative 81666 pI know that if IP payload  MTU then routers usually fragment the IP packet. Finally all the fragmented packets are assembled at the destination using the fields IPID, IP fragment offsets and fragmentation flags. Max length of IP payload is 64K. Thus its very plausible for L4 to hand over payload which is 64K. If the L2 protocol is Ethernet, which often is the case, then the MTU will be about 1600 bytes. Hence IP packet will be fragmented at the source host itself. However, a quick search about IP implementation in Linux tells me that in recent kernels, L4 protocols are fragment friendly i.e. they emtryem to save the fragmentation work for IP by handing over buffers of size which is close to MTU.p  pConsidering these two facts, I am wondering about how frequently does the IP packet gets fragmented at the source host itself.  Does it occur sometimesrarelynever Does anyone know if there are exceptions to the rule of fragmentation in linux kernel i.e. are there situations where L4 protocols are not fragment friendly How is this handled in other common OSes like windows In general how frequently IP packets are fragmentedp

Negative 81666 pI wrote a UserControl that attaches a Javascript function to a forms submit button.  The Javascript function ensures that the page is valid by calling codePageIsValidcode and then proceeds to execute some code. For the problematic pages, the codePageIsValidcode is set to true on first load.  If I dont set the OnClientClick, codePageIsValidcode is correctly set to false on the first load.  I cant figure out why PageIsValid is behaving this way, since no events are being fired at all.  Also, it only happens on some pages and not others.  It seems this is only happening to pages that have the WebFormDoPostBackWithOptions attached to their onclick events.

Negative 81666 pI have added several UIScrollViews as subviews of a single UIView and set the frames so that each one is clearly visable. I set scrollEnabled to YES and set the contentSize larger than the boundsframe.

Negative 81666 pIm nearing the completion of migrating our existing website to a CMS and Ive just finished creating all the various contact forms. The CMS Im using has CAPTCHA built into its form builder, which is great, but the only method available is the decipherthenoisyimage method.p  pThis approach works well, but it limits access for people who might have reading or sight disabilities. Ive worked around this by having a help page which allows those with disabilities to contact us by telephone and Im considering having a singlefield form which says Send us your email address and well contact you. Accessibility is of particular importance to me as a web developer, but from an organisational perspective so is reducing the amount of form spam we receive.p  pSo what Id like to know is, has anyone in the community had any experience with other CAPTCHA methods and how have you managed to make them accessible to people with disabilitiesp

Also, if the agent arrives with a remaining energy of zero or less, he dies, so we print something like Impossible.p  pSo, in the input strong10strong is the initial agents energy, strong3 4strong is the strongSTARTstrong position i.e. column 3, line 4 and we have a maze strong7x6strong. Think this as a kind of labyrinth, in which I want to find the exit that gives the agent a better remaining energy shortest path.p  pIn case there are paths which lead to the same remaining energy, we choose the one which has the small number of steps, of course.p  pI need to know if a DFS to a maze 500x500 in the worst case is feasible with these limitations and how to do it, storing the remaining energy in each step and the number of steps taken so far.p  pThe output means the agent arrived with remaining energy 5 to the exit pos 1 4 in 2 steps. If we look carefully, in this maze its also possible to exit at pos 3 1 column 3, row 1 with the same energy but with 3 steps, so we choose the better one.p  pWith these in mind, can someone help me some code or pseudocode I have troubles working this around with a 2D array and how to store the remaining energy, the path or number of steps taken....p  pEDITp  pLarry, as I said, Ime a little bit confused about the code. Heres what Ive tried so far, only to determine the shortest path with less steps from START to EXIT, fixing EXIT in the meanwhile...p  precodepublic class exitFromMaze       int energy, startY, startX, xMax, yMax     int adjMatrix[][]     boolean visited[][]     ArrayListltCellgt neighbours      ArrayListltCellgt visited     Cell start     StackltCellgt stack      public exM          Scanner cin  new ScannerSystem.in         int nrTests  cin.nextInt         for int i  0 i lt nrTests i              energy  cin.nextInt             startY  cin.nextInt1 start at columnstartY             startX  cin.nextInt1 start at line startX             xMax  cin.nextInt7 cols             yMax  cin.nextInt 8 rows              adjMatrix  new int[yMax][xMax]             visited  new boolean[yMax][xMax]             visited  new ArrayListltCellgt             this.stack  new StackltCellgt             for int r  0 r lt yMax r   yMax linhas                 for int c  0 c lt xMax c   xMax colunas                     adjMatrix[r][c]  cin.nextInt                     visited[r][c]  false                     System.out.printlnmatrix[r][c]  adjMatrix[r][c]                                           start new CellstartX, startY, 0             adiciona a pos actual  pilha de celulasnos             stack.pushstart             printArrayyMax, xMax             findBestExit         endoftestCases           private void findBestExit           BEGINNING OF DEPTHFIRST SEARCH         Cell curCell          while stack.empty              curCell  Cell stack.pop             just fix an exit point ...for now if it works for one, it has to work for all the other possible exits             if curCell.row0 ampamp curCell.col 4                  System.out.printlnArrived at pos curCell.row,curCell.col with E energycurCell.getEnergy with curCell.getSteps steps                 finish  curCell                 break              else                  visited[curCell.row][curCell.col]  true                          this.neighbours  ArrayListltCellgt curCell.getNeighboursthis.xMax, this.yMax             for Cell neighbourCell neighbours                  1 I think somethings missing here and it would be here the point to cut some cases...isnt it               if  curCell.getEnergy  neighbourCell.getEnergy lt this.energy ampamp visited[neighbourCell.row][neighbourCell.col]                   neighbourCell.energy curCell.energy                   neighbourCell.setStepscurCell.getSteps1                   neighbourCell.setPreviouscurCell                   stack.pushneighbourCell                               ...

Negative 81666 pI have a drop down in an ASP.NET page. Whenever the value of the drop down changes an ASP.NET AJAX request is made to the server. I also attached a jQuery change event handler to that list to execute some code when the value is changed. So, probably two different event handlers are being attached to the same drop down, and its causing some problems, i.e., sometimes wrong drop down values are sent to the server. I dont know why is this happening but I think attaching two different event handlers to a same drop down may be the reason.p  pCan anyone tell me what is the problem here If what I guessed is true, then is there any other way to execute some custom javascript code before asp.net AJAX request is sent p

Negative 81666 pWhile attempting to override the explicit interface implementation of the codeICollectionltTgt.IsReadOnlycode property from the codeCollectionltTgtcode class, I came across some documents stating that explicit interface member implementations cannot be overridden because they cannot have modifiers such as codevirtualcode or codeabstractcode. On a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa66459328VS.7129.aspxMSDNa they even go as far as specifying how to make an explicit interface member implementation available for inheritance by creating another abstract or virtual member which is called by the explicit interface member implementation. No problems so far.p  pBut then I wonder strongWhy is it possible in C to override emanyem explicitly implemented interface member just by specifying the interface emexplicitlyemstrongp  pFor example, suppose I have a simple interface like this, with a property and methodp  precodepublic interface IMyInterface      bool AlwaysFalse  get      bool IsTruebool value  codepre  pAnd a class codeAcode which implements the interface explicitly, and has a method codeTestcode which calls its own interface member implementation.p  precodepublic class A  IMyInterface      bool IMyInterface.AlwaysFalse      get  return false        bool IMyInterface.IsTruebool value      return value       public bool Test      return IMyInterfacethis.AlwaysFalse   codepre  pAs you can see, none of the four members are virtual or abstract, so when I define a class codeBcode like thisp  precodepublic class B  A      public bool AlwaysFalse      get  return true        public bool IsTruebool value      return value   codepre  pThen youd expect an instance of codeBcode cast to codeAcode to behave like codeAcode. And it doesp  precodeA a  new A Console.WriteLineIMyInterfacea.AlwaysFalse     False Console.WriteLineIMyInterfacea.IsTruefalse   False Console.WriteLinea.Test                          False A b  new B Console.WriteLineIMyInterfaceb.AlwaysFalse     False Console.WriteLineIMyInterfaceb.IsTruefalse   False Console.WriteLineb.Test                          False codepre  pNow comes the catch. Create a class codeCcode which is an exact copy of codeBcode except for one thing in the class declarationp  precodepublic class C  A, IMyInterface   ... same as B ...   codepre  pNow an instance of codeCcode, when cast to codeAcode, doesnt behave like codeAcode but like codeCcodep  precodeA c  new C Console.WriteLineIMyInterfacec.AlwaysFalse     True Console.WriteLineIMyInterfacec.IsTruefalse   True Console.WriteLinec.Test                          True codepre  pEven the codeTestcode method now calls the overridden method in codeCcode Why is thisp

Negative 81666 pIm making a bandwidth test in flash, and I want to display a progress bar and the current calculated speed.

Negative 81666 pI have a Vs2008 project using version2 of the ASP MVC framework.  I tried to upgrade to VS2010.  I fetched a new copy from svn and opened it.  I got the expected conversion dialog, clicked next and then finish.  A while later comes up a question do I want to also upgrade to the version 4 of .net framework.  p  pIve done this same process twice wioth the same project.  THe first time I clicked no and the second time I clicked yes.  But, if i run a diff across the directories created, theres essentially no difference some generated dlls differ and theres a path difference in the vbproj file but thats it.  If, however, i diff the new and old project I get a whole load of differences.  Thats of course expected, but some of them seem to indicate that its done the upgrade to .net4 anyway  For example, the vbproj file now referneces 4 instead of 3.5 as its tools version and all the reference.vb files generated from the .wsdl files for my web references now have Runtime Version4.0.30319.1 instead of Version2.0.50727.4927 and Resources.Designer has a similar.p  pSo, my question, should there be a difference between the version where I said yes, upgrade the net framework to version 4 for this project and the version where I said no or does ASP run with the old version anyway  I really dont want to find that my new version doesnt work when deployed to production servers which may not have .net 4 installedp

Negative 81666 pImagine for a moment that were using classic asymmetric encription with WCF privatepublic key pairs. Obviously its secure until private keys arent stolen. We dont need any trust chains between keys, right Client only needs to know its servers public key and vice versa.  p  pA problem arises only if client doesnt know servers public key in advance and gets it on the first access. Here we have a risk that actual server is a maninthemiddle instead of the real server. Here we need certificates. Client accesses a server, gets its certificate which contains public key and strongvalidatesstrong it. p  pFor validation client needs to make sure that servers certificate was issued for this particular server. And here we need trust chains. Right p  pIf a client accessing a server via WCF with MessageSecurity.ModeCertificate knowns in advance the servers certificate its public key, can we say that the communication is secure even if the certificate is selfsignedp  pUsualy its believed that using selfsigned certifacate is not secure and should be always avoided in production.br But why If client knows expected public key then gets a certificate, treats it as trusted by matching its public key with the expected one then it doesnt cancel the fact that the server must encypt payload with its private key. And the cypher can be decrypted successfuly with pulbic key if and only if the private key and the public key were created together.  p  pCan you see any flaws in my reasoningp  pIf its correct then can I be sure that using a custom X509CertifacateValidator and setting client proxys ClientCredentials.ServiceCertificate.DefaultCertificate to some fixed on the client X509Certificate securep  pCustom X509CertifacateValidator is something like thisp  precodepublic class CustomCertificateValidator  X509CertificateValidator      private readonly X509Certificate2 mexpectedCertificate      public CustomCertificateValidatorBaseX509Certificate2 expectedCertificate              mexpectedCertificate  expectedCertificate           public override void ValidateX509Certificate2 certificate              ArgumentValidator.EnsureArgumentNotNullcertificate, certificate          if certificate.Thumbprint  mexpectedCertificate.Thumbprint             throw new SecurityTokenValidationExceptionCertificated was not issued by trusted issuer       codepre

Supported but will leave as last resortp  pIm definitely not going with 1 and I will leave the custom data loader as a last result. So my idea is to...p  precodeclass Person      String firstName     String firstNameLower      public void setFirstNameString firstName          this.firstName  firstName          this.firstNameLower  firstName.toLowerCase...       codepre  pWill this work with Hibernate As the GigaSpace dataloader uses Hibernate and my pojo is pretty much an Entity class. Im using Hibernate XML mapping not annotations. The ToLower fields will not be mapped. Does Hibernate call setXXX on all fields that are mapped or does it do some fancy code replacement under the hood and doesnt call the setXXX methods.p  pIm also thinking an annotation would be good use here but not sure how to implement them or even if its possible for this case.p
Negative 81666 pI have a weird case here at work.p  pThe customertelecommunication firm has a server which we publish asp.net web service codes which we designed for them. We use that server and web service to get data from the customers own web service and give out for clienttelephone to use it.p  pThe customer does not allow us to code on the remote server, so we have to work on local computer.  The customer has 2 IPs for its own web services. One of them can be reached only from the remote server, this is an internal IP. Second IP is public which I can reach from my local computer. They address the same methods. For security reasons, they divided IPs. Everything is fine while developing on local. But when I need to publish web service to the server, I need to change web service URLs to remote servers internal IP. But the local Visual Studio web reference doesnt change web service URLs because it cant reach to service as it is only permitted to reach from the server. So I cannot get a build and publish my code.p  pSomehow I need to change my visual studio reference URLs to internal IPso far nobody can reach from local, in orderp  pHope I am clear. Thanksp

Negative 81666 pOur project has recently moved to TFS from CVS and we are all having a bit of trouble adapting to TFSs editinglocking paradigm.p  pUnder CVS, you could change any file in any directory of the source tree and all changes would show up as committable in the CVS frontend WinCVS in our case. Under TFS, all files you havent explictly checked out for edit are flagged as readonly, but you can clear that flag and edit them manually however, TFS then seems unable to determine that the file is changed and hence doesnt allow you to check it in.p  pThis causes a problem when it comes time to commit, because you cant necessarily remember all the files you changed, and TFS doesnt seem to remember either. Its possible to use the Compare view to force TFS actually diff your local files against whats in the vault, but irritatingly this view doesnt allow you to check in  only Check out for edit the files that are different, which then have to be checked in in a separate operation. This is a big PITA.p  pHence my question is there a way to force TFS to see all changed files as committable a la CVS I understand that this is not necessarily desirable, and that TFSs enforcement of editinglocking is best practice, but right now it just isnt working for us.p

Negative 81666 pI apologize if this question is a bit broad, but Im having a difficult time trying to understand how I would create a minimum cost spanning tree. This is in C if it matters at all.p  pFrom what I understand, you would use Kruskals to select the minimum cost edges for building the spanning tree. My thinking is to read the edges into a minheap and that way you can remove from the top in order to get the edge with the minimum cost.p  pSo far Ive only been able to implement the minheap and sets for unionfind, I am still unsure of the purpose of unionfind and a sorting algorithm for the purpose of creating a spanning tree.p  pI would greatly appreciate any advice. p  pEDIT I am not limited to union find, minheap, kruskals, and a sorting algorith, nor am I required to do any.

Then the software can capture if there is any updated version. We are providing support for all our users and we update their servers if there is any updates from our side.  If there is any update we can update an entry in the users database. My question now is, where should I store the latest updates for users.p  pMy intial approach was to store the updated setup files in a shared folder in their server.

Negative 81666 pIm a newbie to Dependency Injection. I have never used and never even undestood what it is exatcly all about, but after my last attack on this topic I found out that is a way of uncoupling an object and its dependencies, once they are not responsible for instantiating the concrete versions of its dependencies anymore, as now the container will do it for us and deliver the ready object in our hands.p  pNow the point is when should I use it, ALWAYS Actually, as Im a newbie and have never even seen a project that uses this pattern I cant undestand how I should apply it to my domain objects It seems to me that I will nevermore instantiate my objects and the container will always do it for me, but then comes some doubts...p  p1 What about oobjects that part of its dependencies comes from the UI, for examplep  precodepublic class UserString name, IValidator validator codepre  pSay that I get the user name from the UI, so how will the conatiner know it and still delliver this object for mep  p2 Theres other situation Im facing if a dependency is now an object that is already instantiated, say... a SINGLETON object, for example . I saw theres settings regarding out the scope of life of the dependency beign injected im talking about Spring.NET, eg http request scope... strongBUTstrong, request and other web related things are on my presentation layer, so how could I link both my presentation layer and my domain layer without breaking any design rule as my domain should be totally unaware of where its is being consumed, not to have layer dependency, etcp  pIm eager to hear from you all. Thanks very much.p
Negative 81666 pI have a screen where I want the user to only input numbers in the text field. I already force a number pad to open in Android, and I am detecting numbers based on their ascii value.p  pI am deliberating trying not to use KeyCode.NUMBERPADX to detect number pad key presses, because that is only a feature of API 11 and up, and I seek higher compatibility with similar features. Similarly, detecting special characters like       , . is a built in function of API 11 and up.p  pOn some Android phones below Android 3.0API 11 , the numeric keypadphone pad also has special characters on it, that the API simply wont ignore. On the G2, only some special characters are ignored, but it allows for       to be input into the EditText field, my character catcher does not notice these inputs even though they are outside of the range for that condition, and I cant use the API 11 level KeyCodes to explicitly detect themp  pAny solutions on how to detect them p  pIt is problematic that the user can input them and that they appear in the text field, yet none of my code detects them nor do they register in the debugger. It messes with my other error handling conditions which currently check to see how long a string is, the user may be able to overflow the strings with these charactersp

Negative 81666 pIf you can figure out this one you are a true SQL guru Its one of the weirdest things Ive ever seen.p  pIve added a trigger to a table in our database. The server is SQL 2008. The trigger doesnt do anything particularly tricky. Just changes a LastUpdated field in the table when certain fields are changed. Its a After Update trigger.p  pThere is a large C legacy app that runs all kind of huge queries against this database. Somehow Ive got absolutely no idea how it is deleting this trigger. It doesnt delete any other triggers and Im certain that its not explicitly dropping the trigger or table. The developers of this app dont even know anything about my triggers. p  pHow is this possiblep  pIve tried running a trace using SQL Server Profiler and Ive gone through each command that its sending and run them using SQL Management Studio but my trigger is not affected. It only seems to happen when I run the app. WTF p  pUPDATEp  pSorry I dont want to waste your time. I just realised that if I change the name of the trigger then it doesnt get deleted. Furthermore if I modify the trigger so it doesnt do anything at all then it still gets deleted. From this I can only guess that the other devs are explicitly deleting it but Ive searched the trace for the trigger name and its not there. Ill hassle them and see what they say. Thanks for the suggestions.p  pUPDATE 2p  pThe other devs reckon that they are not deleting it explicitly. It doesnt exist in sys.objects or sys.triggers so its not a glitch with SSMS. So confused   Guess Ill just rename it and hope for the best Cant think of anything else to try. A few comments below have asked if the trigger is being deleted or just disabled or not working. As I stated, its being deleted completely. Also, the problem is not related to the actual contents of the trigger.

Negative 81666 pIve been experiencing a frustrating issue with Windows Run as Administrator. I have a program A which needs to be run as administrator. I also have a program B which is used to manage dependencies of other programs mainly it creates Command Shells with the right environment variables. Now I dont have control over the B program, but for some reason it creates the Command Shell under a nonadmin user even if I run it as admin. So when I start program A from the command shell, it fails because it doesnt run as admin. If I use the runas command to run it as admin, or if I set As properties to always run as admin, when it starts it doesnt start in the environment created by B, so it doesnt get the PATH and other environment vars. Does someone know if there is a way to use the runas command while preserving the current environment variablesp

Negative 81666 pIm creating a video capture program and I store each frame from in camera into a codeListltBitmapgtcode object but my problem is I ran out of memory after a very short time despite having a generous RAM 6GB. I have been able to narrow down my problem to the amount of images being stored in the codeListltgtcode object 15000 bitmaps in 10 mins at 25fps. I think a realistic solution is to save the images to disk rather than save it in the program. But how do I save such a fast stream of objects to disk and still be able read the images back when I want to playback the images. Or is it possible to save the images as they come to a video stream and then convert to a video at the end of the streaming I noticed converting the images to video reduced the combine size of the files considerablyp

Negative 81666 pI have a complex query that requires a fulltext search on some fields and basic restrictions on other fields. Hibernate Search documentation a hrefhttpdocs.jboss.orghibernatestablesearchreferenceenUShtmlsingled0e4734 relnofollowstrongly advises againsta adding database query restrictions to a full text search query and instead a hrefhttpin.relation.toBloggersHibernateSearch400Alpha2IsOut relnofollowrecommendsa putting all of the necessary fields into the fulltext index. The problem I have with that is that the other fields are volatile values can change every minute or so and those updates to the database may occur outside of the JVM doing the search, so there is a high likelihood that the local Lucene index would be out of date with respect to those fields.p  pLooking for strategy recommendations here. The best Ive come up with so far is to join the results manually by first executing the database query fetching only object IDs and then execute the full text search. and somehow efficiently filter the Lucene results by the set of object IDs from the database. Of course, I dont know how many results Ill get from each separate query, so Im worried about performance and memory. It could be tens of thousands of rows apiece in the worst case.p

Negative 81666 pso, my end game is getting album art from my audio files.  im using taglib and c.  ive found info about how to extract embedded image data, but it seems windows media player does not embed the image itself.  instead, it saves a jpg named something like AlbumArtE32081004FAA4030BB9D6DA5F9D93D18Large.jpg.  clearly its using a guid, which i believe it saves in a PRIV tag.  my question to you folks is how can i get to it  i thought something like this might workp  precode    ID3v2PrivateFrame privFrame  staticcastltID3v2PrivateFramegtprivIter     ifprivFrame  NULL              stdstring owner  privFramegtowner.toCString         if owner  WMWMCollectionID  owner  WMWMCollectionGroupID                      const char data  privFramegtrender.data             GUID guid             memcpyampguid.Data1, data, sizeoflong               codepre  pbut data doesnt seem to have anything useful.  any ideasp
Negative 81666 pIm trying to get some truefalse questions done. Im getting worried when Im answering many of them with true... Please assume that all graphs are strongundirectedstrong and do strongnotstrong have strongdistinct weightsstrong. Negative weights should be fine.p  pQa If G has a cycle with a unique heaviest edge e, then e cannot be part of any MST.p  pMy answer is true. For example, we have a graph with nodes A, B, C, D, E.p  precodeAB  1 BC  2 BD  3 CD  100 DE  4 codepre  pAs you can see, BCD is a cycle. My argument is that since it is a cycle, we can always avoid the unique heaviest edge CD by taking other routes. Therefore it is true. Is my argument sound enoughp  pQb The shortestpath tree computed by Dijkstras algorithm is necessarily an MST.p  pMy answer is true, but my instinct tells me somethings wrong. Well... Disjkstras and Prims are both greedy algorithms. They both go for the lightest weighted edge every time. Are there any cases that a shortestpath tree is strongNOTstrong a minimum spanning tree I actually have a hard time understanding the difference between these two guys.p  pQc Prims algorithm works with negative weighted edges.p  pMy answer is true. Because thats what wiki said... p The algorithm is about finding the lowestcost edge among all edges. So a negative weighted edge shouldnt matter, is it But what about negative weighted cyclep  pQd If G has a cycle with a unique lightest edge e, then e must be part of every MST.p  pMy answer is true. We have to access all nodes in an MST. In a cycle of length 3, for instance, we can always traverse all nodes in that cycle with 2 steps. If there is a unique lightest edge, well most certainly choose it in our MST.p  pAre my claims sound Perhaps they are insufficient So are there any suggestions p

Negative 81666 pstrongtldrstrong  Should I store directories in CouchDB as a list of attachments, or a single tarp  pIve been using CouchDB to store project documents.

Im following the a hrefhttpdocs.neo4j.orgchunkedsnapshotpythonembeddedinstallation.html relnofollowinstallation instructionsa, but Im stuck on the first step, which is to install JPype.p  pIm using OS X 10.7 lion. I think my configuration is pretty standard with Python 2.7.2 downloaded from the Python website and Java 1.6.0 downloaded from the Apple website.p  pWhen I runp  precode sudo python setup.py install codepre  pOn the JPype installer, I get about a 100 lines of error code about various .h files, then it terminates with the linesp  precodelipo cant figure out the architecture type of vartmp ccwOzLi9.out  error command gcc4.2 failed with exit status 1 codepre  pI found a a hrefhttpblog.y3xz.compost5037243230installingjpypeonmacosx relnofollowblog post about a gcc error with JPypea, but I followed the instructions there to no avail. I also emailed the author of that post, and he told me had never actually used JPype, had been working in OS X 10.6, and didnt have any insight.p  pI also emailed the creator of JPype, who told me that he only uses Windows, and has no idea how to make the install work on OS X. But if we can solve this, I can point him to the answer and maybe he can add the solution to the JPype documentation and help lots of other people as wellp  pSo, anyone know what Im doing wrong I would like to use Neo4j, but I dont know Java so Im at a complete loss for how to fix a compiler error.p  pBased on reading every Google result available, my two running theories are thatp  ol lipIm somehow using a 32bit version of Python or of Java though I used standard official installations and cant figure out how to switch to 64bit or if thats even possiblepli lipThe JPype files can only be compiled using GCC 4.0 instead of 4.2. But I cant find anything online about how to rollback to GCC 4.0 or if it comes shipped with 2011 MacBooks and there is some way to force JPype to compile with that instead. pli ol  pThere is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7103024neo4jjpypeinstallationissueanother similar questiona, but the solution there is to use a different adapter that goes through REST instead of hooking directly into Java. I will try that if I have to, but I would really rather use the recommended Neo4j method if its possible.p

Negative 81666 pIm figuring out the right mechanism to pass data from codeUITableViewCellcodes to a codeUIableViewControllercode or codeUIViewControllercode.p  pSearching within stackoverflow I found different ways to do this and finally I found a mechanism that works well but I dont know if it could be a valid approach.p  pThis is the scenario. First, I created a custom cell associated with a xib interface, named codeDataTableViewCellcode, that extends codeUITableViewCellcode. This cell has some outlet to display and modify data and an addictional property called index like the followingp  precodeproperty nonatomic, copy NSIndexPath index codepre  pThis property is refreshed inside the method codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode method within the codeUITableViewControllercodep  precode UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tv cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath      DataTableViewCell cell  DataTableViewCell[tv dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierkCellTableIdentifier]     if cell  nil              [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamedDataTableViewCell ownerself optionsnil]              cell  DataTableViewCellself.dataTableViewCellOutlet            configure the cell with data      do stuff here...       configure the cell with the current indexPath     cell.index  indexPath          return cell  codepre  pSince it is possible to change values within a cell, I had the need to pass data to the codeUITableViewControllercode for updating the model. To do that I decided to use a delegate mechanism. So, I created a protocol with a method like the followingp  precode voidupdateDataDataItemdataItem atIndexPathNSIndexPathindex codepre  pThe codeUITableViewControllercode implements that protocol. In this way, within the cell against to some events, I can call that method and update the model in the correct way.p  pHaving said this, I have some questions to askp  ol liIs this a right mechanism to pass data from a cell to a controllerli liIs it correct to using an index property like the one use in the cellli liIs it the same using retain policy instead of copy policy. What could be the differenceli liSince the solution I found could be very scheming, is it possible to use block insteadsli ol  pAbout blocks, I thought this wayp  pWithin the cell create a property block like the followingp  precodeproperty nonatomic, copy void updateModelOnEventDataItem dataItem codepre  pThen inside the method codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode method within the codeUITableViewControllercode assign that property to a block code like this this code is at the same level of codecell.index  indexPathcodep  precode configure the cell with the current indexPath cell.updateModelOnEvent  DataItem dataItem       [self.model insertObjectdataItem atIndexindexPath.row]  codepre  pCould be a valid alternative In this case, do I have to use copy or retain policyp  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 81666 pI have a JSON structure that needs to be shredded into several core data tables.

Negative 81666 pI hope this question does not get flagged due to the title, this is a specific question that just happens to cover a broad scope of possibilities. p  pIm performing a batch operation that parses a file and preforms a transaction via a socket interface, receives a response, logs it and moves on to the next operation in the batch. The front end is using ExtJS 3.2.1 as the framework, with a PHP proxy set up to handle requests from the client. p  pThis is all working fine, but a single batch file may contain 1,000 operations, each taking around 2 seconds to complete involves preforming calculations and then printing a label. The system that handles this through sockets can not queue the amount of operations contained in a batch, so I am forced to execute these one at a time i.e. send a request, get a response then continue to the next. These could take quite some time to complete, how will the various browsers handle this long of an execution time on an XHR request, even if my codemaxexecutiontimecode in PHP is set appropriately To make things worse, there is also a need to be able to have the script stop and wait for you to change rolls on the printer after a preset number of labels has been printed.p  pThis means, something on the same layer as my UI must process the batch operations one at a time, so that I can notify the user to change rolls, and the user can notify the application that the roll has been changed. So, onto the problem.p  pI tried loading the batch operations into a ExtJS GridView but when I exceed around 900 items the DataView fails. I was planning on using javascript to iterate through the GridView and process these one at a time, logging the response and counting the number of print operations preformed. A DataView is not actually needed, so long as I can store the correct amount of JSON data and iterate through them one at a time I am fine. This is alot of processing though, would a WebWorker be suitable for thisp  pAlso, all of this is running on LAN including the socket connection, so I also have the option of creating a COM object and exposing that to PHP. I could then have the user upload the batch file and point the COM object to the file through PHP, and let that handle everything. But then, how do I inform the user on the status of the batches execution Is all this even possible p  pAm I just being too cautious, could I just set maxexecutiontime on the script running the batch, and use a database to store the batches process with another script to poll the status every codexcode seconds of its status At what point in time will the various browsers decide a script has been running too long p  pLike I said, this is all LAN and will not be deployed anywhere with more than 5 workstations per server usually two only one of which will be performing batch operations at any given time. So server strain is not a huge issue.p  pI know this question is quite drawn out and somewhat a bestpractice question but I have nowhere else to ask other than here, the home of the most brilliant minds on the web. Anyways I appreciate all answerscomments as I am kind of stuck as of where to go from here. Any language will work so long as I can expose it through my HTMLJavascript front end. I am proficient in php, perl, cc, vb, asp, javascript I am just stuck on figuring out which way to handle this.p  pThanksp

Negative 81666 pSo, heres an odd little edge casep  pIf you attach an element to the DOM with jQuery and then immediately call codeaddClasscode on it, you wont get a CSS transition. However, if you call codepositioncode, codeoffsetcode, codewidthcode, codecssleftcode, or any other calculating method on any element between the attachment and the codeaddClasscode call, you emwillem get a CSS transition.p  pHeres a demonstration requires WebKit a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netTrevorBurnhampGZFN relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netTrevorBurnhampGZFNap  pId like to fully understand why this is happening bonus points for linking to the jQuery source code, and to find out if theres a workaround. I have a site where I want the codeaddClasscode call to be conditional on an elements position, but I dont want the usual CSS transition to apply to the newlycreated element.p

Negative 81666 pWindows forms Application. VB .NET 4.0 In my application I have a global boolean variable that  keeps track of when changes are made and when they are saved called changesSaved. On closing even it checks the value of this variable before closing the window.. I am using textchanged event to automatically change the value of changesSaved to FALSE when text is changed.. Problem The group box items are being populated dynamically so the user can edit the values or simply just view them. This dynamic population is causing the textchanged event to fire because the program is changing the text value of the box to put the values in that are stored in the database. The textchanged event should not fire unless the user him or herself enters a value or values in the text boxes.. Is there a way to specify the source i guess you could say for the text changed event or another way so that it will only fire when the user inputs information. Functions are as follows The first is called by the load event to place the values in the box... The next one is the one that is being called as a result of the first one and is also the one that is causing the problems..p  precodePrivate Sub loadPropertyByVal x As Integer     Dim property As propertyinfo  db.propertyinfo.SingleFunctions s.idProperties  x     psettingsCity.Text  property.city.ToString     psettingsState.Text  property.state.ToString     psettingsPropertyName.Text  property.propertyName.ToString     psettingsZipCode.Text  property.zipcode.ToString     psettingsAddress.Text  property.address1.ToString     psettingsCity.Text  property.city.ToString     psettingsState.Text  property.state.ToString         If property.AllowRentProration  1 Then           RentProrate.Checked  True         Else           RentProrate.Checked  False         End If     RentProrate.Visible  True End Sub   Private Sub PropertyTextChangedByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs Handles PropertyDetailsGroup.TextChanged     ChangesSaved  False End Sub    codepre
Negative 81666 pI have an app that supports two data access layers db4o and RavenDB.

If the concrete class happens to be a RavenDB class, then I need to call a method on it. The DataAccessLayerBase, shown here, is in the RavenDb namespace. db4o also his its own DataAccessLayerBase.p  pOne way to fix this would be to have each DataAccessLayerBase implement a common method, like Initialize. The db4o Initialize method would do nothing, and the RavenDB Initialize method would perform the necessary logic. Then this method could simply call Initialize and not care which concrete class it was.p  pstrongIs there a better design than thisstrong I think the fix that I just described is decent enough, but I cant help but think Im missing something. Im looking for a better, more elegant way to solve this. One drawback with my proposed approach is that other data access layers must then implement Initialize even though I only needed it for RavenDB.p  pNote I cant just have the concrete classes do this initialization when theyre created, because it should only happen when a call is made to DataAccessFactory.GetDataInterfacelt.p

Negative 81666 pIm considering a project that involves the browser user being able to screen capture the contents of any web page preferably the whole page, not just the visible portion, do some simple annotation on the image circles, arrows, underlines, text labels and send the annotated image to the server.p  pI see that there are several commercial or freeware browserbased screen capture utilities which I cant use for this project because it requires specific communications with a specific server.p  pIm considering writing my own set of extensions, but its a little daunting, partly because of the COM complexities for IE, but more generally because it seems like such extensions would break easily with browser updates, and since I want it to work across multiple browsers it seems like it could quickly become a maintenance nightmare.p  pDo you know of any open source browserbased screen capture extensions Nice would be code examples showing how to do this on various browsers. Great would be an actively supported library.p
Negative 81666 pLet me prefix this by saying that I know what codeforeachcode is, does and how to use it. This question concerns how it works under the bonnet, and I dont want any answers along the lines of this is how you loop an array with codeforeachcode.p  hr  pFor a long time I assumed that codeforeachcode worked with the array itself. Then I found many references to the fact that it works with a emcopyem of the array, and I have since assumed this to be the end of the story. But I recently got into a discussion on the matter, and after a little experimentation found that this was not in fact 100 true.p  pLet me show what I mean. For the following test cases, we will be working with the following arrayp  precodearray  array1, 2, 3, 4, 5 codepre  pa hrefhttpcodepad.org7DIeObk9Test case 1ap  precodeforeach array as item    echo itemn   array[]  item  printrarray   Output in loop    1 2 3 4 5    array after loop 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5  codepre  pThis clearly shows that we are not working directly with the source array  otherwise the loop would continue forever, since we are constantly pushing items onto the array during the loop. But just to be sure this is the casep  pa hrefhttpcodepad.orgnirz6UfhTest case 2ap  precodeforeach array as key gt item    array[key  1]  item  2   echo itemn   printrarray   Output in loop    1 2 3 4 5    array after loop 1 3 4 5 6 7  codepre  pThis backs up our initial conclusion, we are working with a copy of the source array during the loop, otherwise we would see the modified values during the loop. emBut...emp  pIf we look in the a hrefhttpphp.netmanualencontrolstructures.foreach.phpmanuala, we find this statementp  blockquote   pWhen foreach first starts executing, the internal array pointer is automatically reset to the first element of the array.p blockquote  pRight... this seems to suggest that codeforeachcode relies on the array pointer of the source array. But weve just proved that were emnot working with the source arrayem, right Well, not entirely.p  pa hrefhttpcodepad.org6n20ooMyTest case 3ap  precode Move the array pointer on one to make sure it doesnt affect the loop vardumpeacharray  foreach array as item    echo itemn   vardumpeacharray   Output   array4      [1]gt     int1     [value]gt     int1     [0]gt     int0     [key]gt     int0      1   2   3   4   5   boolfalse  codepre  pSo, despite the fact that we are not working directly with the source array, we are working directly with the source array pointer  the fact that the pointer is at the end of the array at the end of the loop shows this. Except this cant be true  if it was, then a hrefhttpcodepad.org7DIeObk9test case 1a would loop forever.p  pThe PHP manual also statesp  blockquote   pAs foreach relies on the internal array pointer changing it within the loop may lead to unexpected behavior.p blockquote  pWell, lets find out what that unexpected behavior is technically, any behavior is unexpected since I no longer know what to expect.p  pa hrefhttpcodepad.orgJJp79xSdTest case 4ap  precodeforeach array as key gt item    echo itemn   eacharray    Output 1 2 3 4 5  codepre  pa hrefhttpcodepad.orgIfwJyTCLTest case 5ap  precodeforeach array as key gt item    echo itemn   resetarray    Output 1 2 3 4 5  codepre  p...nothing that unexpected there, in fact it seems to support the copy of source theory.p  hr  pstrongThe Questionstrongp  pWhat is going on here My Cfu is not good enough for me to able to extract a proper conclusion simply by looking at the PHP source code, I would appreciate it if someone could translate it into English for me.p  pIt seems to me that codeforeachcode works with a emcopyem of the array, but sets the array pointer of the source array to the end of the array after the loop.p  ul liIs this correct and the whole storyli liIf not, what is it really doingli liIs there any situation where using functions that adjust the array pointer codeeachcode, coderesetcode et al. during a codeforeachcode could affect the outcome of the loopli ul
Negative 81666 pI consistently run into the need to clean up css files and strip unused css elements. I am aware that google chrome has the capability to display all the unused css elements on a page but there are times like a project I am working on right now where the original designer left hundreds of unused elements within this file.p  pSo, my question here is  does anyone know of a way to customize the google chrome developer console to export a list of all used CSS elements. Or, is anyone aware of an existing google chrome plugin which provides this functionalityp  pI realize there is a firefox plugin which provides these capabilities but I would love to find a similar solution for google chrome.p  pThanksp
Negative 81666 pIm trying to convert an ASPVBScript OAuth library to VBA. One of the challenges is this line of codep  precodeGetSignature  b64hmacsha1strSecret, strBaseSignature codepre  pThis function, b64hmacsha1 is actually a function contained in a JavaScript library.

I am having trouble getting my conditional statement to return true for matching values.p  pHere is a snippet of my bash codep  precodevar1curl s w httpcoden www.somesite.com var2cat somefile  if [[ var1  var2 ]] then     echo TRUE else     echo FALSE fi codepre  pI have manually looked at both the strings and they seem to be identical. Ive done wc with all applicable options with it. Ive copy and pasted both the values into Notepad and did a find for the expected string and it said that both values matched the find command.p  pObviously, if I manually put the values in the condition it returns true, so I know its not my conditional statement.p  pMy guess is there is some type of hidden character on the end of curl...r or n or something that I am unaware...or maybe on the end of the file that I am unaware of. Is this a known issue when trying to compare curl output and file contentp  pThis may be a dumb question, but for the life of me I cannot seem to get these strings to match doing it dynamically instead of hardcoding the values in the condition.p  pAny suggestions would be great.

Negative 81666 pI recently installed Zend Studio 9 and created a Zend Framework project. In the setup options it says that it includes the Zend Framework library and when a project is created, under all the project files in the php explorer it says its being included. p  pWhile this is true, I notice that the library folder is empty. When I try to run publicindex.php in the browser, it doesnt display anything.p  pMy question is how can you include the built in library so that my publicindex.php file shows in the browser I know you can download the zend library files and put them in the library folder, but that gives a ton of warnings, and I cant help but think there is an easier way when the library is supposedly built right in.p
Negative 81666 pOn github, I forked an old version of another project. I made some changes and am trying to push them onto my fork on github.

How can I push the changes to my github accountp  pI realize this isnt much information...what else can I say I have a feeling that it may be because Im modifying the files directly in homegitproject...p

Negative 81666 pI am looking at taking the inverse of a large matrix, common size of 1000 x 1000, but sometimes exceeds 100000 x 100000 which is currently failing due to time and memory. I know that the normal sentiment is dont take the inverse, find some other way to do it, but that is not possible at the moment. The reason for this is due to the usage of software that is already made that expects to get the matrix inverse. Note I am looking into ways of changing this, but that will take a long time p  pAt the moment we are using an LU decomposition method from numerical recopies, and I am currently in the process of testing the eigen library. The eigen library seems to be more stable and a bit faster, but I am still in testing phase for accuracy. I have taken a quick look at other libraries such as ATLAS and LAPACK but have not done any substantial testing with these yet. p  pIt seems as though the eigen library does not use concurrent methods to compute the inverse though does for LU factorization part of the inverse and as far as I can tell ATLAS and LAPACK are similar in this limitation. I am currently testing the speed difference for eigen with openMP and without.p  pFirst question is can anyone explain how it would be possible to optimize matrix inversion by parallelization. I found an article a hrefhttpwww.bhrc.ac.irPortalLinkClick.aspxfileticketoLt3rF1LlToamptabid584herea that talks about matrix inversion parallel algorithms, but I did not understand. It seems a hrefhttpworldcomp.orgp2011PDP5100.pdfthisa article talks about another method I am also not sure if scaLAPACK or PETSc are usefulp  pSecond question, I read a hrefhttpwww.hpca.uji.esficherosremonpdp11.pdfthisa article of using the GPUs to increase performance, but I have never coded for GPUs and so have no idea what is trying to convey, but the charts at the bottom looked rather alarming. How is this even possible, and how where do I start to go about implementing something like this if it is to be true.p  pI also found a hrefhttplara.inist.frbitstreamhandle2332784RR200204.pdfsequence1thisa article, have yet had the time to read through it to understand, but it seems promising, as memory is a current issue with our software.p  pAny information about these articles or the problems in general would be of great help. And again I apologize if this question seems vague, I will try to expand more if necessary.p

A client issues the HTTP CONNECT command to a HTTP proxy. The proxy then makes a TCP connection to a particular serverport, and relays data between that serverport and the client connection. Because this creates a security hole, CONNECTcapable HTTP proxies commonly restrict access to the CONNECT method. The proxy allows access only to a whitelist of specific authorized servers. p  pso the question is what is the difference without it  p

Negative 81666 pI have a ListView with two columns.  The second columns width needs to be static.  However, the user has the option of sliding a Gridsplitter which will expandcontract the ListView horizontally.  What I need to happen is to have the first column of the ListView resize as the ListView itself resizes.p  pIt sounds like all one would have to do is have a routine that increments or decrements the Listview column 0 width depending on the change in width of the host Listview.  I just dont know how to go about implementing this.  I was thinking I could do an element property binding, but it would have to involve a mathematical operation which I am not sure element property bindings supportp

Here are the main points of interaction with my serverp  ol liBefore making REQUESTPURCHASE request to Google I make a request to my web server to register a new purchase. If the request succeeds I get a nonce from the server.li liWhen transaction finishes I receive an array of notification Ids to pass them to GETPURCHASEINFORMATION request. At this point I need to use nonce received in step 1 from my server. stronglt I got stuck herestrongli liWhen GETPURCHASEINFORMATION succeeds I get a signedJson and a signature which I pass to my server. It verifies the purchase and commits the transaction on the server.li ol  pWhat I can not understand so far is two thingsp  ol listrongHow to identify a previously generated nonce by incoming INAPPNOTIFY intent in my casestrong As far as I understand it can correspond to either current purchase completion or another purchase refund. From what I see we have only notification id which has no relation to a REQUESTPURCHASE request.li listrongHow to securely handle refunds in that way that my server is 100 acknowledged about this eventstrong The most natural way IMHO is to periodically request Google server from my server to retreive the actual status for the order. Unfortunately, in my country developers can not use Google Checkout API. Another way is to periodically check the order state via device using GETPURCHASEINFORMATION request passing known notification ids and new nonces. If the check fails during some period the purchase will be automatically expired until the first successful order state verification. Is this scenario possible Can I use known notification id to make GETPURCHASEINFORMATION requests after CONFIRMNOTIFICATIONS request for the orderli ol  pstrongEDITstrong Regarding refunds point 2 theres a related topic a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11190856androidinappbillingsecurityissuesAndroid InApp billing security issuesa. strongIs it correct that there is no builtin end user functionality in Google Play to ask developer to refund inapp purchasestrong If so, then we might implement a button within our application to send such refund request to our server including all necessary info like verified user credentials and then manually process a refund in both Google merchant account and servers database.p

Furthermore, when I pause and play the tracks they continue to get more out of sync.

Negative 81666 pThis post is similar to an earlier post about preventing the corruption of PGP binary files when transferring those files to an FTP server using C httpstackoverflow.comquestions7353993ftpchangingpgpfileduringtransferincsharp, though Im asking a  different question.p  pSummaryp  pIve fixed the source of the PGP file corruption by textarmoring all of my PGP encrypted files however, I have a bunch of PGP binary files that were encrypted and uploaded to my FTP server prior to implementing this fix.  Knowing the code used to upload the files to the FTP server and the software used to manage the FTP server, is it possible to fix the corrupted PGP binary files so that they can be decrypted and recoveredp  pDetails 1 I have PGP encrypted files that were encrypted using Gpg4Win that are not textarmored they are binary files that were uploaded from an IIS 6.0 webserver using VB .NET code included below to a CoreFTP server.  p  p2 I do not have unencrypted copies of these files.  They were encrypted in memory on the webserver before being uploaded to the CoreFTP server.  Thus, I need to decrypt the binary PGP files, otherwise the data in the files will be lost.p  p3 The binary in the PGP files has been corrupted such that, even though I have the correct PGP private key, I cannot decrypt the files in Gpg4Win.  Gpg4Win is not able to find  read the PGP data in the encrypted binary files.  p  p4 I am able to successfully decrypt more recent PGP encrypted files that were textarmored the binary data was stored in base64 notation before uploading to the CoreFTP server.  Therefore, the decryption problem is most likely due to file corruption rather than any issue with Gpg4Win or my PGP private  public key pair.p  p5 Several binary file recovery programs that Ive tried to use on the PGP binary files say that they cannot find the file data and are unable to fix the binary file corruption.  Or, they do not make any alteration to the binary data contained in the PGP binary files.p  pVB .net code used to upload PGP binary filesp  precodePublic Function UploadFileByVal localFileName As String, ByVal FTPFilename As String, ByVal UseBinary As Boolean, ByVal uniqueName As Boolean, ByRef StatusDescription As String As FtpStatusCode     Dim request As FtpWebRequest  CTypeFtpWebRequest.CreateFTPFilename, FtpWebRequest     request.Credentials  New NetworkCredentialUsername, Password      If uniqueName Then         request.Method  WebRequestMethods.Ftp.UploadFileWithUniqueName     Else         request.Method  WebRequestMethods.Ftp.UploadFile     End If     request.UseBinary  UseBinary      Dim ff As New FileInfolocalFileName      Dim fileContentsConvert.ToInt32ff.Length As Byte      Using fr As FileStream  ff.OpenRead         fr.ReadfileContents, 0, fileContents.Length     End Using      Using writer As Stream  request.GetRequestStream         writer.WritefileContents, 0, fileContents.Length     End Using     Dim response As FtpWebResponse  CTyperequest.GetResponse, FtpWebResponse     StatusDescription  response.StatusDescription      Return response.StatusCode End Function codepre  pFor my FTP server Im using the latest version of CoreFTP for Windows.  p  pWhen responding to the FTP LIST command, CoreFTP returns the file information in Unix format rather than the MSDOS format, so Im wondering if the binary corruption was the result of transferring a binary file from a Windows server that uses MSDOS formatting for binary files to an FTP server that uses a Unix format.  However, I have not experienced any issues opening  reading nonPGP binary files uploaded from my webserver to the CoreFTP server.p  pThank you Isaacp

Negative 81666 pIm writing a simple virtual serial port device to report an older serial port. By this point Im able to enumerate the device and sendreceive characters.p  pAfter a varying number of bulkout transmissions from the host to the device the endpoint appears to give up and stop transferring data.

However my code never intentionally issues a STALL condition on that endpoint and the status flag for having generated one never gets set though.p  pGiven the short amount of time elapsed lt300 s between issuing the request and the STALL it would appear to be an invalid response of some sort, and not a timeout.

Negative 81666 pI followed some examples for making an codeNSButtoncode subclass work as an codeNSColorWellcode since our codeNSButtoncode subclass already gives us the appearance behavior we need, however Ive noticed that after using the button to invoke the panel and changing the color, its also changing the color of selected text in our document. If I instead subclassed codeNSColorWellcode with our appearance customizations, would it not have this problemp  pHowever, Im still hoping for a workaround that avoids that amp still lets us use our button subclass.

I know there are some examples of how to do this, such as LittleProxy, but the code is fairly complex, and since Im a n00b to netty, Im trying to make my first code as simple as possible without getting off into the weeds.p  pFor now, Im ignoring all concerns about concurrency, and only have one channel established from server A to server B I know this will break horribly with concurrent requests, but it makes my initial task simpler.p  pMy approach is the followingp  ol lipSet up client bootstrap and connect to server B running on localhost port 18080. Get the corresponding channel.pli lipStart server A listening on port 2080 with a pipeline that decodes the http request and then writes to the channel going to server B.pli lipAdd a listener to the resulting channel future that will copy the content of the response from server B to the response to the original clients request to server A.pli ol  pHeres the code I have very short in which Im trying to do exactly what I describe above. My problem is that I dont know how to copy the response from server B to the response from server. The one way I have figured out to do this results in an IllegalArgumentException when I write to the original client in the response sent by server A I checked the content of the ChannelBuffer, and the correct text was returned by the proxied server.

Negative 81666 pI just started playing around with the google API and have scoured the docs.  It seems pretty straight forward.  According to google, a call on their API returns json.  Why then do I have to stringify the json before parsing the json before I call key values in jQuery  Here is the sample of code I am working withp  precode.ajax     url httpswww.googleapis.complusv1peopleuser numberactivitiespublickeymy api key,     data          maxResults 20,         verb post     ,     dataType json,     type get,     success function data          var numactualposts  0         data  .parseJSONJSON.stringifydata         var listElements  ulgoogleFeedUL li          for var i  0 i lt data.items.length i              if data.items[i].verb  post                  listElements[numactualposts].appenddata.items[i].object.content                 numactualposts                 if numactualposts gt 5                      break                                            ,     error function e          alerte       codepre  pNOTE I have to call 20 posts, because shares made by user also get returned when post verb is requested for some reason.  I then look for actual posts within the returned json in order to display only real posts.  The docs also dont seem to tell you how to extract data by explaining the json object hierarchy, so I just had to track it down through the console.  data.items[i].object.content is the content of a google post.p
Negative 81666 pI just setup a new server for a client to move their code from a hosted solution to a server in their office. New hardware running Windows 2003 Server with IIS 6. All the Service packs up to date. There are two separate websites running in IIS. The first is their corporate website. The second site is their web app.p  pThe web app has one default.asp page on the root and then all the code is in subfolders no subwebs. ALL the code runs except ONE FOLDER called Reports.

Were working with an RDP solution where the navision client runs on 2 RDP servers which our users use. This means that we only need to be able to deploy the DLL to these 2 servers.

Negative 81666 pIm using HTML5 full screen mode on browsers that support it cant share link to code yet, its not live. Ive run into a problem that I think maybe an Safari bug, but I wanted to also post here to see if anyone had suggestions on a workaround. p  pMy app is using an image slider that has a div with links above it for hover effects tough to explain, but bear with me. The default width of both the images and the hover DIV are 1150 pixels via CSS, and using a media query to specific the links div width this is SCSS code, so it may look funny to those not used to it. p  precode.links      width 1150px     height 744px           position absolute     zindex 101      media maxwidth 1200px          width 910px         height 588.77px           codepre  pI also provide a way to go to full screen via HTML5 full screen and that specifies a custom width  height for this div because screen sizes will vary, and my links have to hover at certain positions, using percentages. All of this is working fine. Drag the browser around between under and over 1200px wide and the hover states scales properly with the image. Go to full screen, everything scales appropriately on the image and the hovers. However if I start in a browser that is  1 sized below 1200 pixels  2 go to full screen 3 then exit full screen mode strongin safari onlystrong it doesnt scale based on the media query and leaves the .links class sized at 1150 pixels wide. p  pIf I resize anything, it goes back to working  scaling properly. p  pI cant think of a way to trigger the CSS media query outside of a resize event. I dont want to add a separate class via jQuery on my exit of fullscreen because Id have to remove it on subsequent resizing. p  pAny other suggestions for a workaround p

Negative 81666 pI have downloaded the FreeRDP project from a hrefhttpwww.freerdp.com relnofollowhttpwww.freerdp.coma. I have tried to import the android project after removing the .cmake extension for the XMLs and PROPERTIES files. I tried importing and resulted with a build error, a NullPointerException in ECLIPSE IDE. I have the latest Eclipse IDE with ADT and Android SDK. p  pPlease help me run this project on android client and windows server. There is a readme file for android, which I read and never understood what I actually have to do. p  pstrongThe README filestrongp  precodeOverview   The FreeRDP Android port consists of two parts the Android Java GUI clientAndroid  and the JNI bindings clientAndroidjni which are written in C and wrap FreeRDP to  be used with Java. The JNI is directly integrated within FreeRDPs build system. For building the GUI part there are three possibilities   integrated ant build  have cmake to operate ant and build everything  manual ant build  build JNI with cmake and invoke ant manually for the GUI  IDE builds using your favourite IDE  use cmake for building JNI and your IDE for GUI  Manual build and IDE build are mostly used for development.   Build requirements   For the Android port some additional dependencies need to be fulfilled   for JNI  Android NDK gt r9  prebuild static openssl libraries see below   for the Java GUI if build with ant  ant  Android SDK  version gt 21  FreeRDP requires openssl libraries for building but they are not part of the  Android NDK and therefore they need to be prebuild manually. Multiple source versions and builds of static openssl libraries are floating around. At the time of writing we have tested and used httpsgithub.combmiklautzAndroidexternalopensslndkstatic. However, any other static build should work as well.  To build openssl  git clone gitgithub.combmiklautzandroidexternalopensslndkstatic.git cd androidexternalopensslndkstatic ndkbuild  found in the Android NDK   Building   Integrated build   Run the following commands in the top level freerdp directory. Dont forget to set ANDROIDNDK, ANDROIDSDK and FREERDPANDROIDEXTERNALSSLPATH to the absolut paths on your machine  cmake DCMAKETOOLCHAINFILEcmakeAndroidToolchain.cmake  DANDROIDNDKyourndkpathhere  DFREERDPANDROIDEXTERNALSSLPATHyoursslbuildrootpath  DANDROIDSDKyoursdkpathhere make  After that you should have a clientAndroidbinaFreeRDPdebug.apk.  Manual ant builds  First run cmake to prepare the build and build JNI. Dont forget to set ANDROIDNDK, ANDROIDSDK and FREERDPANDROIDEXTERNALSSLPATH to the absolut paths on your machine  cmake DCMAKETOOLCHAINFILEcmakeAndroidToolchain.cmake  DANDROIDNDKyourndkpathhere  DFREERDPANDROIDEXTERNALSSLPATHyoursslbuildrootpath  DANDROIDSDKyoursdkpathhere DANDROIDBUILDJAVAOFF make  Now you can run your favourite ant command in clientAndroid like this  cd clientAndroid ant debug install  Using an IDE  Here is an example on how to use Eclipse for developingbuilding the Java GUI. For this the Android development tools for Eclipse are required available via the eclipse marketplace.  cmake DCMAKETOOLCHAINFILEcmakeAndroidToolchain.cmake  DANDROIDNDKyourndkpathhere  DFREERDPANDROIDEXTERNALSSLPATHyoursslbuildrootpath  DANDROIDBUILDJAVAOFF make  Open Eclipse and choose File gt Import gt General gt Existing Projects into Workspace  Browse to the clientAndroid directory in your FreeRDP folder and click finish. If you get something like Project aFreeRDP is missing required source  folder gen just build the project once and you are good to go.  Side note If you add G Eclipse CDT4  Unix Makefiles when running cmake you can also import FreeRDP into Eclipse too. Then you have one Java project and one cc project you can work on. This requires CDT to be installed in Eclipse.   cmake variables   JNI related   CMAKETOOLCHAINFILE  the toolchain file to use must be cmakeAndroidToolchain.cmake  ANDROIDNDK used from toolchain file  absolute path to the NDK  ANDROIDABI used from toolchain file  Android ABI to build for default is armeabiv7a  FREERDPANDROIDEXTERNALSSLPATH used by FindOpenSSL  absolut root path to the prebuild static openssl libraries  WITHDEBUGANDROIDJNI  enable debugging for JNI  The libraries must be located in objlocalarmeabi or objlocalarmeabiv7a. Cmake searches in armeabi first then armeabiv7a. It is possible to build FreeRDP for armeabiv7a and link against armeabi openssl but not the other way around. Therefore it is suggested to build openssl for armeabi.  Java GUI related   ANDROIDBUILDJAVA used by clientAndroidCMakeLists.txt  can be ONOFF default OFF whether or not to build the GUI with cmake  ANDROIDSDK used by clientAndroidCMakeLists.txt  absolute path to the Android SDK to use  This is used to generate local.properties needed by ant. Needs to be set if you build manually with ant or do integrated builds.   Development   Updating JNI headers   Whenever the FreeRDP API changes or you need some extra functionality in your Java GUI the JNI needs to be updated. The JNI headers are generated from the compiled Java classes   edit clientAndroidsrccomfreerdpafreerdpservicesLibFreeRDP.Java to    reflect your changes  build the Android Java project as described above  run .scriptsregenerateJNIheaders.sh from your FreeRDP checkout top level   directory  After that you need to implement the functionality in clientAndroidjniandroidfreerdp.c and add the call to clientAndroidjnigeneratedandroidfreerdpjni.c. After that FreeRDP and the Android package need to be rebuilt to include the latest libfreerdpandroid in the package.

Negative 81666 pI am currently working on a webbased Java EE application. In order to achieve multiple client capability I decided to set up the the whole application for each client on a separate server or to be exact on a separate Amazon EC2 instance. I am aware that this kind of strict separation may seem awkward but architectural constrains require the applications to be physically separated from each other. So what I got at the moment is the followingp  pIPaclient1p  pIPbclient2p  pBoth pointing to more or less the same application with IPa and IPb being static IPs.p  pWhat I want to do now, is make these services accessible through one domainname likep  pmydomainname.comclient1 p  pand p  pmydomainname.comclient2p  pwhile solely accessing mydomain.com will display some sort of login asking the user to define the clientworkspace.p  pComing up with this architecture I had some kind of proxy in my mind, so that the domainname points to that proxy, which then forwards the request to the right server according to the client part.

Negative 81666 pI need to implement an authorization mechanism inside a SOA Im currently designing.p  pWell have three services, each one is imposed to only communicate using their public interfaces, so any kind of intercommunication and background processing must involve an authorization against other service endpoints.p  pPlus well have a client application running inside the user browser, which will, of course, need to access resources as well.p  pSo well have both servertoserver and clienttoserver communications servertoserver will be needed when one of the services will need to perform some task involving resources exposed by another service.p  pIm currently looking to implement OAuth2 since Id really like to have a standard authorization framework, and more specifically I was thinking to implement the a hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmldraftietfoauthv228section1.3.4 relnofollowClient Credentialsa to authorize servertoserver, and a hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmldraftietfoauthv228section1.3.3 relnofollowResource Owner Password Credentiala for the inbrowser application which will send the user data on login and then forget the password to enhance security.p  pIt should be working well, but it seems Ive found some parts of the specification conflicting with this design becausep  ul liClient Credentials should only allow clients to access their own resource so not acting on users resourcesli liEach endpoint 3 in my case should require a different token, while it would make more sense to me to have the browser client request one and only one token once and then use the same token agains all backendservices using a refresh token whenever the current token expires, making all transparent to the final user, once the session that will only exist inside the client application expires it will delete the refresh token.li liThe 2legged oauth2 schema also seems a good way to handle the clienttoserver communication but it seems to require additional permanent keys alongside userpassword which doesnt seem to make sense to me it would if I only have one client, but looking forward to create new clients it would not make sense to replicate user credentials to authenticate the user in order to get the private key.li ul  pSo my questions arep  ol lican I use a separated Authorization service exposing APIs to have one centralized OAuth2 providerli licanshould I share one token between the client and all backendsli ligiven Id exploit scopes to restrict the current clients abilities who should actually check at requesttime the scope Should it be the Authorization service or the Resource Server itselfli liAny reccomendation of how would you implement a OAuth2 provider in this situationli ol  pId really like to avoid a custom pubkey solution for servicetoservice looking forward for possible 3rd party implementations plus the dev team will be required to have a deep understanding of OAuth2 for other purposes so it would be really nice to use it internally as well.p  pP.S. I have no authentication service, the authentication of client and resource owner will be performed by the Authorization framework itself since it encapsulates user account. But I also have a Users service handling user preferences so it would also be possible to export the resource owner credentials verification there.p

Negative 81666 pIve been assigned to a project that is a complex legacy system written in C and ActiveX  10 years old.p  pThe setup is Microsoft Visual Studio 2008. p  pWhilst there are no issues with the system right now, as part of the security review of the legacy system, an automated security code scanning tool has marked instances of realloc as Bad Practice issue, due to security vulnerability. p  pThis is because realloc function might leave a copy of sensitive information stranded in memory where it cannot be overwritten. The tool recommends replacing realloc with malloc, memcpy and free.p  pNow realloc function being versatile, will allocate memory when the source buffer is null. It also frees memory when the size of the buffer is 0. I was able to verify both these scenarios. Source MDSN Library 2001p  blockquote   prealloc returns a void pointer to the reallocated and possibly moved memory block. The return value is NULL if the size is zero and the buffer argument is not NULL, or if there is not enough available memory to expand the block to the given size. In the first case, the original block is freed. In the second, the original block is unchanged. The return value points to a storage space that is guaranteed to be suitably aligned for storage of any type of object. To get a pointer to a type other than void, use a type cast on the return value.p blockquote  pSo, my replacement function that uses malloc, memcpy and free has to cater for these cases. p  pI have reproduced below the original code snippet an array implementation that uses realloc to dynamically resize and shrink its internal buffer.p  pFirst the class definition p  precodetemplate ltclass ITEMgt class CArray    Data members protected ITEM                pList int                 iAllocUnit int                 iAlloc int                 iCount  public CArray  iAllocUnit30, iAlloc0, iCount0, pListNULL    virtual CArray      Clear Invokes SetCount0 which destructs objects and then calls ReAlloc   codepre  pThe existing ReAlloc methodp  precodevoid ReAllocOld      int iOldAlloc  iAlloc       work out new size     if iCount  0         iAlloc  0     else         iAlloc  intfloatiCount  floatiAllocUnit  1  iAllocUnit       reallocate     if iOldAlloc  iAlloc              pList  ITEM reallocpList, sizeofITEM  iAlloc       codepre  pThe following is my implementation that replaces these with malloc,memcpy and freep  precodevoid ReAllocNew      int iOldAlloc  iAlloc       work out new size     if iCount  0         iAlloc  0     else         iAlloc  intfloatiCount  floatiAllocUnit  1  iAllocUnit       reallocate     if iOldAlloc  iAlloc               sizet iAllocSize  sizeofITEM  iAlloc          ifiAllocSize  0                      freepList  Free original buffer and return                   else                      ITEM tempList  ITEM  mallociAllocSize  Allocate temporary buffer               if tempList  NULL  Memory allocation failed, throw error                               freepList                 ATLTRACETCArray Memory could not allocated. malloc failed.                  throw CAtlExceptionEOUTOFMEMORY                           ifpList  NULL  This is the first request to allocate memory to pList                               pList  tempList  assign newly allocated buffer to pList and return                            else                               sizet iOldAllocSize  sizeofITEM  iOldAlloc         Allocation size before this request                  sizet iMemCpySize  miniOldAllocSize, iAllocSize     Allocation size for current request                   ifiMemCpySize gt 0                                       MemCpy only upto the smaller of the sizes, since this could be request to shrink or grow                       If this is a request to grow, copying iAllocSize will result in an access violation                       If this is a request to shrink, copying iOldAllocSize will result in an access violation                      memcpytempList, pList, iMemCpySize  MemCpy returns tempList as return value, thus can be omitted                      freepList  Free old buffer                      pList  tempList  Assign newly allocated buffer and return                                                codepre  pNotesp  ol lipObjects are constructed and destructed correctly in both the old and new code.pli lipNo memory leaks detected as reported by Visual Studio built in CRT Debug heap functions a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarye5ewb1h3vvs.90.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarye5ewb1h3vvs.90.aspxapli lipI wrote a small test harness console app that does the followingp  pa.

Een ontzettend mooie witte zaal vol karakteristieke elementen. De prijs was goed en de bediening nog beter. Een echte aanrader Uitkijk op het water, een terras voor de rokers onder ons en echt sfeervol ingericht.,                     Wij hebben een slechte ervaring met de mensen van de Beachclub.rnOnze ceremonie vond plaats op het ponton, gevolgd door een buffet en een feest. rnEchter de service was erg slecht. We hadden van te voren afspraken gemaakt, maar daar werd op de dag zelf geen aandacht aan geschonken. rnHet is voor ons een bijzondere dag en voor ons en vele gasten zou het een leuke dag moeten zijn. We betalen daar veel geld voor, maar dat heeft voor hen geen waarde. rnZe hebben wel excuses aangeboden maar we hebben geen tegemoetkoming in het geld gehad. We hebben dus betaald voor dingen die we niet gekregen hebben. Na afloop bleek het dat zaken duurder waren dan van te voren werd gesuggereerd.,                     Afgelopen augustus zijn wij hier getrouwd. We hadden van tevoren een aantal prettige, vriendelijke gesprekken waarin besproken werd welke zaal, welke consumpties, etc. Er was op een gegeven moment wat miscommunicatie over welke zaal we gereserveerd hadden maar dit kon gelukkig nog worden opgelost. Het gekozen diner kon van tevoren worden geproefd.nOp de dag zelf arriveerden wij laat en liep het diner dus uit, dit is in overleg tussen de keukenbediening en onze ceremoniemeesters flexibel en zonder problemen verlopen. Het eten heeft een prima prijskwaliteit verhouding, hoewel de details van de gerechten verschilden bij het proefeten en het diner op de bruiloft zelf. Vooral de tournedos viel in de smaak  Het diner hielden we in Bruisend, het mooie openbare restaurant van de locatie. Onze bruiloft viel net buiten het hoogseizoen en ondanks het prachtige weer hebben we geen andere gasten dan onze bruiloftsgasten gezien.nDe bediening is erg vriendelijk en de sfeer van de feestzaal, Sunset, paste helemaal bij hoe we onze bruiloft wilden knus, vrolijk, gezellig, zomers. Sunset is exotisch ingericht en vanuit de zaal kun je het terras en eventueel verder het strand oplopen. Voor ons een mooie afsluiter van de dag, we kijken met een tevreden gevoel terug,                     Eind September 2012 hebben wij onze bruiloft gevierd in beachclub Sunrise, zaal Sunset.  We hebben romantische fotos gemaakt op het strand en in het water... een aanrader Samen met onze daggasten een bijzondere middag gehad en genoten van een heerlijk diner. Service was uitstekend. De avond werd afgesloten met een knalfeest Na grote twijfels tussen het boeken van een band of dj... hebben we via Aqua Best, dj Harry en saxofonist geboekt, succes gegarandeerd Vanaf het begin stond de dansvloer helemaal gevuld en er is volop gedanst tot het einde. Nog steeds krijgen we veel complimenten over het personeel en de verzorging van het feest. Het was allemaal top geregeld.  De locatie is romantisch, knus en heel sfeervol. Helemaal zoals wij het wilde Een bijzondere, unieke plek voor een onvergetelijke dag,                     In september 2010 zijn wij getrouwd en we hebben geborreld, gegeten en gefeest bij Bruisend. Ook hebben we op de pier nog fotos gemaakt. Het was een geweldige dag. Super goede service en eten en drinken in overvloed. Perfect verzorgd allemaal en een SUPER sfeertje. Van te voren hebben we duidelijk onze wensen besproken en bijna alles was mogelijk. Er wordt door ons en onze vrienden familie nog geregeld gesproken over dit fantastische feest. Zeker een aanrader dus,                     wij zijn op 1 juni 2012 getrouwd op Sunrise en hebben er aansluitend gegeten en gefeest. Trouwen deden we op het Ponton, en dat had een heel romantisch sfeertje. daarna hebben we lekker genoten van de BBQ en als klapper een mega groot feest, niemand heeft gezeten iedereen dansteHelemaal geweldig was dat we zelfs op het terras een springkussen mochten plaatsen voor de kids die er overdag waren we hebben alleen maar leuke en fantastische reacties gehad van vrienden en familie. ze hebben onze dag helemaal tot een om nooit meer te vergeten gemaakt en we hebben samen met ons zoontje echt genoten beter kan een huwelijk niet beginnen,                     Sunrise was in een woord FANTASTISCH Namens ons, maar ook namens alle gasten. Al vanaf het eerste informerende gesprek werd de tijd voor ons genomen, luisterend naar waar we op zoek zijn en bespreken wat er mogelijk is. Vrijblijvend, vriendelijk en relaxt. nDe dag zelf was ook goed. De bediening was zeer vriendelijk, snel, attent en de hele dag goed aanwezig. Diner was lekker.nHet waren vooral de finishing details die ons speciaal deden voelen proactief vragen of we wat extra frietjes willen voor onze peuter, altijd een vriendelijke glimlach en interesse voor de gasten, de barman die niet moeilijk doet als een van de daggasten een whisky wil drinken ipv. een mixdrank, privebediening voor het bruidspaar er werd goed op ons gelet, en we hebben de hele dag niet een keer om bediening hoeven vragen.nWat we erg fijn vonden was de balans van de dag s middag rustig en relaxt, en s avonds party. Uiteraard ook mogelijk omdat Sunrise verschillende locaties zalen heeft, en mooie lounge faciliteiten.nHet feest was ook super. DJ Harrie was de koning We hadden een vrij complex gezelschap met alle leeftijdsgroepen aanwezig, maar hij heeft de dansvloer vol gekregen en gehouden tot het einde. Bediening, versiering, verlichting alles primanWe hebben heel veel positieve feedback ontvangen en ik weet zeker dat Sunrise er weer nieuwe toekomstige klanten bij heeft.n,                     Wij zijn 14092012 getrouwd op het ponton van sunrise, absoluut een unieke en bijzondere locatie. Wij zijn verder heel de dag op sunrise gebleven dus ook het diner en feestavond daar gehad. En onze trouwdag was meer dan geslaagd. De begeleiding van sunrise met tips en ideen was super. De service met betrekking tot hapjes en drankjes was super, niemand stond zonder drinken. De huis dj was top, en we hadden een top feest met iedereen op de dansvloer Kortom ik raad iedereen aan om bij sunrise te trouwen                 ],                 overallscore [                     10,                     1,                     8,                     9,                     9,                     10,                     9,                     10                 ]                      ]       codepre  pstrongUPDATE wrapping the JSON in the callback functionstrongp  pBased on comments I now havep  precodetestsite.createReview  functionc      testsite.reviewWidgetId  c.id     console.logcalling service     var a  httpwww.testsite.comtestservice.svcgetcompanyreviewdetailsid  c.vendorId  ampt  c.type  ampcallbackparseWeddingJSON      var b  document.createElementscript     b.setAttributetype, textjavascript     b.setAttributesrc, a     testsite.headLoc.appendChildb   function parseWeddingJSONjson      console.logparseWeddingJSON     console.logjson  codepre  pBut the codeparseWeddingJSONcode function is not executed.

Negative 81666 pmy audio plugins are bundles with binaries containing exports for all supported formats, say AU and VST. I copy the exact same bundle just different extension to p  precodeLibraryAudioPlugInsComponents for AU and LibraryAudioPlugInsVST for VST codepre  pNow when user opens say the VST plugin, it works fine. But when he opens the AU plugin afterwards it crashes and from the stack trace it looks like a complete mess one module calling the other etc. I originally thought its the good old Cocoa global classname, being the huge Mac OS X design flaw, but it seems its not the case, because the VST uses Carbon. p  pIt seems it doesnt load the AU module at all, it just created another component from the VST module, just with AU interface I have a global variable in there, so I logged its address and its the same for both plugins, so it must be the same module, rightp  pUnfortunately I need really the right one loaded for each, because they have different initialization and globals. So how can I make OS load the second one properlyp  pThanksp
Negative 81666 pI have the file which contains the list of telephone number ranges and their owners names of mobile operators  a hrefhttpwww.rossvyaz.ruopendata7710549038RosnumbaseKodyDEF9kh.csv relnofollowhttpwww.rossvyaz.ruopendata7710549038RosnumbaseKodyDEF9kh.csvap  precode9001940000194999910000Sky1800 9160999999910000000Mobile TeleSystems 91702999930000Mobile TeleSystems codepre  pAnd I will have new phone numbers each week in the format like 79161234567. So, I should detect their operators. So, I am planning to download updated list each week and then to match phones I have against this list. The main question is how to do it effectively. Once Ive downloaded the file, what is the best way to keep that in memory and then search for the mobile operatorp  pThe first idea is to read the file line by line, parse it, compare DEF codeif 916  deffromthelinecode, if so, then compare the range codeif 1234567gtrangestartfromtheline and 1234566ltrangeendfromthelinecode, but it will not be quite effective taken into consideration that I will have to look for several phone numbers.p

Negative 81666 pSo Im attempting to create a Template Link List class in C. Everything works perfectly, including the remove and search in question , EXCEPT when I call the two methods on a value not in the LinkList. Ideally, Id like the methods to return after its discovered that the value is not in the list  , however, I feel like the methods continue on and attempt to remove or search for a value further because when I run the executable, I get the Segementation Fault core dumped error. The program prints the correct error if the methods are called on an empty list.p  pThe list is singly linked with a head and is implemented using smart nodes i.e. nodes that contain their own methods to compliment the matching class methods as opposed to dumb nodes that contain no methods and require the class methods to create temporary pointers to the nodes and iterate through the list.p  pHere are the implementations for search and remove. Of course, I can provide more of the code if necessaryp  precodeREMOVE  template ltclass Tgt void TLinkedListltTgt  removeT value   ifhead                               if there is no head     stdcerr ltlt Error List is Empty ltlt stdendl   The list is empty     return      ifheadgtdata  value     listSize     decremenets listSize since a node is removed     node  temp  head     head  headgtnext     delete head     return      else     ifheadgtremovevalue  If something was removed as a result of the nodes remove       listSize       return                 decrement listSize since something was removed          else                     else if nothing removed       stdcerr ltlt Error  Value not in list ltlt stdendl       return           template ltclass Tgt bool TLinkedListltTgt  node  removeT value   returns a bool.

The edmx diagram is inside the repository.EF project.p  pThe common.model project will have base entities that both the modules poco entities will inherit from. The problem I have in my edmx diagram is that I need to use multiple namespaces. Module1.Model and Common.Model. Plus I have also separated out the entities within both projects into different folders which means I have to use x number of different namespaces.p  pThe current edmx diagram only has one namespace textbox but I need to use several. Is there a way using the xml part or by code first to map the entities from different namespacesp  pIm sure other people must have run into this problem before. Otherwise I will have to remove the common.model project and have the same entities in each module which means duplicating everything.p

Negative 81666 pIve encountered an error on a codebase I was working with. Certain values were not being passed from one process to another. After much frustration, I narrowed down the culprit to a single RMI call. The client process would make a call to retrieve some data from the server. The method returns an codeArrayListcode of a certain class. Debugging showed that the server properly runs through the method, but the client never regains control. The client just hangs. Digging down, I realized that the class that the client needed does not implement codeSerializablecode. Changing that fixed the problem.

Negative 81666 pIm writing an nginx module that wants to subscribe to a zeromq pubsub socket and update an inmemory datastructure based on the messages it receives. To save bandwidth, it makes sense that only emoneem process should make the subscription, and the data structure should be in shm so that all processes can make use of it. To me it seems natural that that one process should be the master since if it was a worker, the code would have to somehow decide emwhichem worker.p  pBut when I call codengxgetconnectioncode from my codeinitmastercode or codeinitmodulecode callbacks, it segfaults, apparently due to codengxcyclecode not being initialized yet. Google searches on plugins doing work in the master process seem pretty pessimistic.

Negative 81666 pguys, i have a question regarding SQLite query performance for my future app. It will consist of roughly 5000 rows each containing a 4 columns with a sum of roughly 10 words in each row for the four columns in total. Will this be hard for a handset device to query if i introduce a search feature, that would show result on the fly Or is there an alternative solution to thisp
Negative 81666 pI have a WinForms Application that was designed to support Full HD resolutions so 1920x1080. Now this App is also supposed to run on a lower resolution 1600x900.  Is there a way to let the application auto scale itself to fit the lower resolution Like you would just downscale an image, basically resizing and relocating each control.  My current forms and panels have set their size to 1900x1080, so they just extend out of the screen on the lower resolution. I have played around with AutoScaleModes and AutoSize, but the best I could get were Scrollbars so that you at least navigate through the forms. Is such a thing as downscaling an application even possible retaining dimensions relative sizes and positions of the controlsp  pThanks in advance for any inputs on thisp

Negative 81666 pSo recently I was working a bug for LED notifications in our app.  The bug report was specific to Galaxy S3  S4 and Android 4.4, where our LED notification was not working.  The user reported that other apps such as yahoo mail still are able to show the LED notification. It was also reported that the LED notifications work for the other apps while charging. Though I have never experienced LED notifications coming through while charging... p  pAlso while reading the android doc I came across this statement   Your notifications shouldnt use a different color unless the user has explicitly customized it.p  pa hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comdesignpatternsnotifications.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comdesignpatternsnotifications.htmlap  pMy thinking is that the reason for this is that some android devices have different color LEDs and the LED notification may not display at all if the device doesnt support that LED color...  For example my S2 only shows a blue LED color, while my HTC one shows, orangered and greenyellow.p  pSo the question is does anyone know if LED handling changed in android 4.4  The class we are using is the api 1 notification class, Ive coded some examples using the NotificationCompat.Builder class and was able to get the LED to light up on 4.4 devices, but aside from how the notification is built I see no different between the twop

Negative 81666 pSo I know many of you will advise against this but I want to send floats via TCPIP to a TCP Server running on a SoC Zynq7020, with the server on the Arm A9.

Negative 81666 pI am fairly new to Ruby on Rails, have only been using it for 6 months.  Previously I worked primarily in .NET, and have architected some large web applications using that framework.  I have been a proponent of code generation for some time, which is part of what attracted me to RoR for my next application. p  pIn the .NET world, I had a lot of success using generated code, inheritance and partial classes to more easily enable refactoring, enhancements and maintenance of generated code.  Essentially, within each layer of the applications, generators were used to create base classes with core functionality.  Those base classes could then be subclassed to extend or modify the behavior as necessary to address the needs of each specific component.  p  pOver time, however, we often needed to make changes to the generated code without overwriting the handwritten extension code.  In a .NET world, that was quite manageable using partial classes to implement the subclass extensionsoverrides, keeping the generated code files separate from the extension code files.p  pI am now trying to decide how to best accomplish the same thing in an RoR world, and am hoping for some guidance from those of you that may tried similar approaches.  I have not found anything analogous to partial classes in ruby, but maybe there is a different mechanism to accomplish the same thing.p  pBelow is a quick example of how I typically organized code in a .NET world p  pgeneratedBaseEmployee.csp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic abstract class BaseEmployee    public BaseEmployeestring name, decimal salary        this.Name  name     this.Salary  salary      public string Name  get protected set    public decimal Salary  get protected set    public virtual void GiveRaisedecimal amount        if this.AuthorizeRaiseamount this.Salary  amount      protected virtual AuthorizeRaisedecimal amount        if amount gt this.Salary  0.1  no raises over 10       return false     else       return true     codepre  pgeneratedEmployee.csp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepublic partial class Employee  BaseEmployee    public Employeestring name, decimal salary  basename, salary    codepre  pextensionsEmployee.csp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodepartial class Employee    public Employeestring name, string title, decimal salary       basename, title, salary     protected override AuthorizeRaisedecimal amount        if this.Name  Mr. Dithers   this clown gets no raise       return false     else       return base.AuthorizeRaiseamount     codepre

Negative 81666 pApologies about the vague titles, wasnt really sure how else to describe the problem.p  pI recently ran into a case where I have to loop through an array of objects to compare multiple value, I opted for using a for loop in a for loop to compare each object with every other object.p  pWhile this works fine on small arrays, once my array gets a little bigger say 10,000 objects performance tends to be a big issue.p  pThis array contains these kind of objectsp  precode[ char , from 0, to 2, chrLength 2 ,  char , from 0, to 7, chrLength 7 ,  char a, from 1, to 3, chrLength 2 ,  char a, from 1, to 6, chrLength 5 ,  char , from 2, to 7, chrLength 5 ,  char a, from 3, to 6, chrLength 3 ] codepre  pThe idea is that I can only select objects where the codefromcode and codetocode dont overlap with any other object. codefromcode and codetocode are indexes in another arrayp  pSo for the example array, possible outcomes would bep  precode[ char , from 0, to 2, chrLength 2 ,   char a, from 1, to 3, chrLength 2 ,   char a, from 1, to 6, chrLength 5 ,   char a, from 3, to 6, chrLength 3 ] codepre  pThe way I handled it was as followsp  precodevar canUse  true,     posibilities  [] fori  0 i lt l i      canUse  true     forvar j  0 j lt l j          ifresults[i].from lt results[j].from ampamp results[i].to gt results[j].to              canUse  false             break                    ifcanUse posibilities.pushresults[i]  codepre  pSeeing performance is quite terrible with larger arrays, Im wondering if there is a better solution to do thisp

See how there are multiple view controllersviews in the email app  How does one build a custom controller container that designates the location of such subview controllers  How do you properly add such a controller  Id like to know the correct way as designated by apple best practice. img srchttpi.imgur.comfrLXYLC.png altWWDC Conference Imagep  pEDIT After looking at this some more I was thinking a possible way would be to create views with custom sizing and then push those to the parent.  Is this the correct wayp

Negative 81666 pIm working on a fairly simple mobile App, geared more towards people who may have trouble with technology. As such, it needs to be as easy to use as possible and I need to be able to play HTML5 audiovideo files on start. The problem, as many of you may know, is that mobile devices tend to turn off Autoplay of video content for bandwidth purposes. Im told there are ways around it using some mild scripting, but all the resources Ive found seem to either be outdated, or unsuited to my needs. The development tool Im using allows me to plug in HTML5 code, but I need to be able to plug in a video that will run without user input.

Until now I started the alarm in the OnEnabled method, like thisp  precodeIntent intent  new IntentCLOCKWIDGETUPDATE PendingIntent pendingIntent  PendingIntent.getBroadcastcontext, 0, intent, PendingIntent.FLAGUPDATECURRENT  AlarmManager alarmManager  AlarmManager context.getSystemServiceContext.ALARMSERVICE  alarmManager.setRepeatingAlarmManager.RTC, System.currentTimeMillis, 1000  60,             pendingIntent codepre  pThe settings are saved in shared preferences with a unique name widgetId and in this OnEnabled method I cant retrieve the settings here because I cant get the widgetId yet.

Negative 81666 pI have been coding BackboneJS and have successfully built large projects using BackboneJS and AMD.p  pI am now looking into using AngularJS and have got an implementation with AMD and have built some controllers and services so pretty comfortable so far. p  pOnly thing is that we build a lot of applications that need to be localised for different territories. Because of this I have successfully configured Angular Translate and it works fine.p  pWhat Angular Translate does not support is the creation of localised url routing which is something I was able to achieve easily in BackboneJS by dynamically updating the routes object.p  pCan anyone point me in the right direction for an article or post on how to do this with AngularJS. Been trawling through Google but cannot seem to find anythingp

Negative 81666 pIm trying to get my head around how I would introduce tokenbased keybased authentication to a web API currently looking at Sinatra, but maybe Rails too that would be used by a mobile client and how OAuth would fit into the picture.p  pSo, lets say I want to create a web service that uses Facebook for authentication and grabbing basic user data. Here, my API would be a client to Facebooks OAuth Server, requesting an access token upon a users successful login to Facebook. This would then grant me access to the users data which I would use to create an entry in my database, storing this userspecific token with any other application information I would like linked to them.p  pI think I got that part right so far, but heres where Im a bit confused.p  pI think that my API would also need some form of API key to grant access to a mobile user, since I wouldnt want to transmit and store the Facebook key on their device. Would I have to have a separate store of keys which I provide to the client to access my service Are there any best practice ways of doing this p

Negative 81666 pI am trying to open and read a text file from the command line in c using Xcode6 as the title says but it is not opening. I know this from the if statement that checks whether the text file is open. I have looked around for a solution and there are various questions that are similar but I still couldnt get mine to work. Below is my code. I would post the images of my Xcode app but I dont have enough reputation yet. Basically I have added the text file to my project folder and am passing the text file argument through the scheme interface. The code seems to be right based on multiple sources so I suspect the scheme set up isnt correct. I have also tried adding quotes to the text file argument but that doesnt change anything.p  pLastly, if the question is redundant and the answer is given elsewhere then let me know.

I know that the proper usage of codeWhenAllcode is with codeawaitcode keyword, but still, im wondering why there is so big difference in performance for these lines.p  pAfter analyzing the flow of the system I think Ive figured out how to model the problem in a simple test application test code is based on I3arnon answerp  precode    public static void Test              var tasks  Enumerable.Range1, 1000.Selectn gt Task.Run gt Computen          var baseTasks  new Task[100]         var stopwatch  Stopwatch.StartNew         for int i  0 i lt 100 i                      baseTasks[i]  Task.Run gt                              tasks.Selectt gt t.Result.SelectManyr gt r.ToList                                Task.WaitAllbaseTasks         Console.WriteLineSelect  0, stopwatch.Elapsed          baseTasks  new Task[100]         stopwatch.Restart         for int i  0 i lt 100 i                      baseTasks[i]  Task.Run gt                              Task.WhenAlltasks.Result.SelectManyresult gt result.ToList                                Task.WaitAllbaseTasks         Console.WriteLineTask.WhenAll  0, stopwatch.Elapsed      codepre  pIt looks like the problem is in starting tasks from other tasks or in codeParallelcode loop.

Negative 81666 pIn a simple calculator app, I use abstract actions to handle the buttons being clicked with the mouse and the respective number pad keys with key bindings being pressed. I wanted certain cosmetic changes to occur upon using the keyboard, such as changing the border of JButton number 1 when I press the number 1 key. And changing it back upon release. This all works. Then I went and started pressing the JButtons with my mouse again and realized that the key released action never gets invoked, obviously because Im not using the keybinding. So my question is, is there a way to invoke the appropriate released abstract action when the mouse releasebutton raisesp  pWhen I discovered this, I initially tried thisp  precodeAbstract action set border to this.. code.. code.. code.. set border to this..  codepre  pSo no matter if the key or the mouse, it would change. However it doesnt change, or probably goes so fast its undetectable.p  pIt doesnt make sense to register a mouse listener in this instance. I tried this anyway and I cannot seem to register the abstract action as a mouse listener.p  pThanks for your input and ideas.p  pI register actionlistenerp  precode    btnMultiplication.addActionListener operatorAction      btnDivision.addActionListener operatorAction      btnAddition.addActionListener operatorAction      btnSubtraction.addActionListener operatorAction      btnSix.addActionListener numberAction      btnSeven.addActionListener numberAction      btnEight.addActionListener numberAction  codepre  pthe Actions are abstract actionsp  pI use this for keyboard inputp  precodeim.put KeyStroke.getKeyStroke KeyEvent.VKNUMPAD0, 0, false , Number  im.put KeyStroke.getKeyStroke KeyEvent.VKNUMPAD0, 0, true , Number Released  am.put Number, numberAction  am.put Number Released, numberActionR  codepre  pI used the strongNumberstrong action to change the border of the respective jbutton. Then I use strongNumber Releasedstrong to change the border again.p  pObviously, when I click with the mouse, the border highlights. But the strongNumber Releasedstrong doesnt invoke. Like I stated, eliminating the released aspect all together and putting the first border change at the start of the strongabstract actionstrong and then the final border change at the end of the strongabstract actionstrong evidently goes so fast you cannot see the border change.p
Negative 81666 pIn a web based application for example I am having a form called Employee in that addEmployee is a method which internally a uses a web service jaxws RI .p  pIn web service method we get the one field called nextNo, which is having default value as 0 and in we will increment each time for every request the unique no 1 and we returns that incremented value so at first we get value 1 from web service and we will set that unique value to some field called document No and like this we do operations, p  pBut for some transactions after getting response from web service while updating into my database i got some exception so that my entire transaction is rollback but unique value is incremented by 1 is not getting rollback because some other thread is already incremented it from that earlier value.p  pfor example at first default is 0,p  pthread 1 performs gets the value 1 and updated it.p  pthread 2 performs gets the value 2 and updated it.p  pafter completing 100 p  pthread 1  performs add and updated 101 into DbWeb service application and returns 100p  pbut while in the same flow some exception came and transaction is rollback, but the no which is incremented from 101 to 102 because some other thread is working on this table and updated value to 102, i.e 101 is missing in the series of unique numbers, dirty read is happening in this scenario how can eliminate this jumping of these unique no, how can i make the system to wait until completion of addEmployee method no other transaction should not update that unique no incremented table record not entire table p  pI am new to spring,  I tried by using spring TransactionalisolationIsolation.SERIALIZABLE but it is not working, p  pCan anyone suggest me on thisp  pNotep  pwe can not keep the sequence for that No unique, I had to manually increment based on some condition.p

Only way to do that I believe is to convert the list to JSON object. p  pCurrently, I am passing the list directly like thisp  precodeHttpPost httpPost  new HttpPosturl httpPost.setEntitynew UrlEncodedFormEntityparams, HTTP.UTF8 HttpResponse httpResponse  httpClient.executehttpPost codepre  pThe problem with this is that nodejs cant interpret any characters except English characters. So if I change the list to JSON object, I can specify the header and charset, then express can interpret the characters properly.p  pSo basically, How do I convert this List myList to an array of JSON objectp  pThanks. Any help appreciated.p

Negative 81666 pThe MDN documentation for a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebAPIWindowgetComputedStyle relnofollowcodegetComputedStylecodea statesp  blockquote   pThe values returned by getComputedStyle are known as resolved values.   These are usually the same as the CSS 2.1 computed values, but for   some older properties like width, height or padding, they are instead   the used values.p blockquote  pIs there a way to only get the strongcomputedstrong values without the strongusedstrong onesp  pemMy use case is thisemp  pTake for instance a body element. The browsers width is currently code600pxcode.

Negative 81666 pIm working with OpenTSDB for a school project. In the project I am supposed to create a structure for storing time series data from robots.

Negative 81666 pThe more general question here is in productionquality code, does one need to be concerned with exceptions produced by the ExecutionContext or other concurrency infrastructure, outside of the execution of the futures body  For example, if some failure happens with the thread pool, will I see an exception returned in a future that failed to execute because of itp  pThis, in turn, is leading toward how should error handling be done with futures.  Im onboard with the general advice that errors should be returned, not thrown, using e.g. either Either or scalactics Or.  But this seems greatly complicated if, when a future is invoked, one needs to factor in exceptions from the infrastructure, even when everything else is written in an exceptionfree or exceptionwrapping manner.  But I wont ask for advice on that  it will get this post closed as too broad, I think. p

Negative 81666 pI am trying to append a URL using jQuery. p  pI have a grid of warnings on my page, populated from a servlet. There is a check box at the top of the screen, which when checked will show the cleared warnings along with the active ones. Basically, this check box is showing and hiding rows of the grid.

Negative 81666 pI have a checkout form which includes a field to enter a coupon code. Currently, the form always posts to a payment merchant.

This includes a variable called codepaymentcode which specifies the sum to be paid. This sum gets updated based on the coupon entered. Ajax is used to display the updated sum on the screen but to keep it secure codecheckcouponcode, and not the script which is only for the number shown on screen, sets the actual sum to be send to the merchant.p  pIf codepaymentcode is zero, I would like the second form not to post to the merchant, but instead redirect to coderootpathcode with a flash message. How can I do this How can I make the codeactioncode for the second form variable depending on the updated value for codepaymentcode preferably using Ruby and not javascriptp

Negative 81666 pI have added a Select all  deselect all wrapper round a Select2 multi select control.p  pIt works by looping through the options, pushing the values into an array then passing the array to the selct2 val as followsp  precodemySelect2.select2val, mySelectedValuesArray codepre  pThis works fine in Chrome and in cases where there are not so many options to be selected. But in IE8 where they might be 100 options the browser freezes as it attempts to render the selected values and I get multiple Stop Running this Script alerts.

Negative 81666 pI have a Google App script that is copying files from one folder to another. First, it checks to see if there are any files in the source folder. If there are, it deletes the files in the target folder and then copies the files from the source folders to the target. Once the copy is complete, it should delete the files from the source folder. However, it is not working as I am expecting it to and I believe the issue is in the codeifcode codeelsecode statement. I have a codewhilecode loop within the codeifcode codeelsecode statement. My thoughts was that the codewhilecode loop would finish before it checked the codeifcode statement, but this does not seem to be the case.p  pThe issue is that the script deletes on of the files in the target folder instead of keeping both of the files.

So if Angular were to send a PUT for the object, it should not try to send the details of any class, only the reference. This would be enforced server side to protect the data, but to avoid errors, the client shouldnt try.emp  pemFor background, Im using SailsJS and PostgreSQL for the backend API.emp
