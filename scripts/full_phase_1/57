Positive 57 pIm trying to get an old Flex project up and running.  It was written by someone else, in Flash Builder.  Ive imported it into FDT.p  pIve noticed that all my MXML image links are all broken.p  pI thought I could remedy this by adding the assets directory to the package contents.  Project Properties  FDT AIR Properties  Desktop ... added the assets directory  But it didnt help.p  pI found a workaround.  I simply sayp  precodeltmxImage sourceEmbedassetspicture.png codepre  pInstead ofp  precodeltmxImage sourceassetspicture.png codepre  pI also tried assets, srcassets, ..assets, ..assets etc... by the way, assets is a subdirectory of srcp  pBut Im curious why adding the assets directory to the package didnt work.  And given that the project must have worked before asis  Id like to make it work for me, without modification.p

Positive 57 pI am trying to connect to an SFTP server with my AIR application. It doesnt matter that its an AIR application except that I havent found any libraries or AIR API methods for it. p  pMy first thought is to find a library in another language and rewrite it in ActionScript. Id rather not do that and my lack of experience may introduce security issues. p  pMy second thought is to call a native process or command such as codesftpcode or codesshpasscode or codecurlcode from my main application and pass the local and remote upload locations to it and let it do the work. The downside to this is if they dont have the command installed they have to install a separate program.p  pMy questions are p  ol liAre these SFTP commands available by default on both Mac and Windows li liShould I store the users login I do not want to or prompt them to enter it each time Does SFTP  public key remove the need for that li ol  pIve found two related questions a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24457328sftpscpfileswithbashrq1herea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5386482howtorunthesftpcommandwithapasswordfrombashscriptherea but some of it is over my head. They also seem to be specific to nux which may work for Mac as well but not Windows. p  pI do not have the experience in this area so I would welcome those with experience to give guidance if this is a good idea or not. Overview type answers are welcome for me as I can attempt to work out the details. If no answer is given, once Ive figured it out Ill post an answer.

Positive 57 pIm building a mixed interaction AS3AIR application. Some of my scenes use the regular CPU rendered display classes flash.display.Sprite, flash.display.MovieClip and another highdensity graphics mode uses Starling. I can switch between and use these happily, and I can switch between windowed mode at 720p to fullscreen mode just fine.p  pHowever, I just added a StageWebView to easily add some HTML based content, and Im having trouble with resize. If I dont call new Starling then the StageWebView instance will correctly resize to maintain the same relative screen dimensions when I switch from windowed to FullScreen. However, as soon as I create a Starling instance, the StageWebView will not correctly resize on fullscreen it retains the absolute dimensions originally specified. If I dont instantiate Starling, the StageWebView resizes perfectly.p  pDo I need an event handler for Event.RESIZE to specifically adjust the viewPort member of the StageWebView object How do I get the correct relative dimensions from the original fixed windowed size I tried looking at stage widthheight and the numbers were oddly large, with AIR failing to build a new Rectangle correctly.p  pI would appreciate any sample code for anyone who has solved this problem. Thanks.p

This space should be filled with the app contents fullscreen images etc but the 68px space which originally contained the bar is just solid white or whatever backgroundColor the stage is set to p  pAfter a lot of trial and error Ive nailed this down to the fact that I have renderMode set to direct in the app descriptor xml. If I remove this the app contents fill the screen, but obviously I dont have access to the GPU accelerated rendering system.p  pIm assuming this is something to do with AIR asking the devices hardware of its resolution, which it returns as 1920x1032 even though the actual number of pixels is 1920x1080. So under the hood AIR is only setting up a renderable window of 1920x1032 when in renderModedirect.p  pDoes anyone know of a way of enabling true fullscreen when in renderModedirect  p
Positive 57 pI have an air application that I have developed that only I use at the moment. It works fine but I have recently got a 4K monitor and am annoyed at the applications that are not written to support the custom DPI settings in windows that you use to make sure that text is actually still readable on this high DPI screen.p  p...it turns out that my application is not written to support this...p  pCan I get hold of the custom DPI value and use that somehowp  pI have used the applicationDPI setting when developing for mobile before but it does not seem to help much here. I have set it to 120, the lowest and the application is still tiny. If I set it higher it gets even smaller.p
Positive 57 pSo, Im building fairly simple application for portrait mode only, and it will have vertical scrolling for content.p  pContent is basicly a MovieClip containing image as background and other minor elements couple small MovieClips as buttons etc.p  pThe problem is that I dont seem to find a smooth way to scroll my content. I would love it to be smooth and accurate, and Ive tried numerous different ways for it.p  pFor testing purposes the background Im using inside my codecontentcode MovieClip is 533x1250 jpg from library.p  pThis is how I add my codecontentcode mc and backround into itp  precodescaleXFactor  stage.stageWidth  640 my stage is 640x960 ... addChildcontent which is new MovieClip var bgbg1  new bg1 bg.x  p1bg.y  0 bg.width  640  scaleXFactor  bg.scaleY  bg.scaleX content.width  bg.width content.height  bg.height content.addChildbg codepre  pFor scrolling I assumed Id be safe by just simply using MOUSEDOWN amp MOUSEUP event listeners and basic ENTERFRAME function like thisp  precodemouseLastPos  stage.mouseY ifMouseUpVar  1                                                             mousePosDiff  mouseOriPosYmouseLastPos                                                                   content.y  mousePosDiff1.2 mouseOriPosY  stage.mouseY                              ifMouseUpVar  0 Smoothening which is allowed by MOUSEUP     ifmousePosDiff gt 0         mousePosDiff  0.001     else ifmousePosDiff lt 0         mousePosDiff  0.001       ifcontent.y lt content.height  stage.stageHeight1                     content.y  content.height  stage.stageHeight1 else ifcontent.y gt 0     content.y  0  codepre  pIn debug player its as smooth as you can ever imagine, but in real device Samsung Note4 its very laggy and clumsy.p  pIve also tried freshplanets script, which is not as laggy, but still a little clumsy, and messes up my scaleY for some reason.   And IScrollerComponent seems to have some issues on AIR, and I didnt get any visual elements on my screen with it. Rendering settings or cacheAsBitmap didnt seem to have any effect on this.p  pHow should this be done right Is it normal that this small image 533x1250 causes bad lag  I really need to use AS3 and AIR for this, so Im hoping to find a good and simple solution yeah, that doesnt happen too often.p  pThanks,   kaartop

Negative 57 pI have a checkout process for a shopping cart that is currently storing credit card data in the session for retrieval once the user finalizes the purchase. The purchase process is set up such that the user inputs the credit card, views a confirmation page, and then finalizes the order. The confirmation and finalization actions are the only two actions that need access to the credit card data and to be safe all other actions should discard it. p  pShort of doing reflection in a base controller to check the current action the user is calling, I cannot think of an elegant way to discard the data on the disallowed requests. Additionally, if the user fails to make another request after entering the data it will linger in the session until they come back to the website whenever that happens. One suggestion I was offered was encrypting the data into a hidden field and relying on the SSL ticket to prevent caching the markup. This seems like a fairly safe approach, but I dont much like the idea of placing the credit card data in a useraccessible location encrypted or not. Storing in the database is out because the client does not want credit card data saved.p  pWhat is the ideal approach to temporarily persisting sensitive data like credit card information across more than one page requestp  hr  pPerhaps someone can tell me if this is a sufficient approach. I have set my Shopping Cart which is stored in the session to have a unique Guid generated every time the object is newed and that Guid is used as a key to encrypt and decrypt the credit card data which i am serializing with the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAdvancedEncryptionStandardRijndael algorithma. The encrypted card data is then passed to the user in a hidden field and deserialized after finalize is clicked. The end result is a string much like this p  precodeVREZ2bWRPsfxhNuOMVUBnWpE2f0AaX4hPgppO4hHpCvvwt2fMQu0hxqA2fCJO2faOEi2bX3n92fP923mVestb7r82bjkSVZDVccd2AJzCr6ak7bbZg83d codepre  hr  precodepublic static string EncryptQueryStringobject queryString, Guid encryptionKey      try              byte[] key  Encoding.UTF8.GetBytesShortGuid.EncodeencryptionKey.Truncate16must be 16 chars         var rijndael  new RijndaelManaged                                                            BlockSize  128,                                IV  key,                                KeySize  128,                                Key  key                                      ICryptoTransform transform  rijndael.CreateEncryptor          using var ms  new MemoryStream                      using var cs  new CryptoStreamms, transform, CryptoStreamMode.Write                              byte[] buffer  Encoding.UTF8.GetBytesqueryString.ToString                  cs.Writebuffer, 0, buffer.Length                 cs.FlushFinalBlock                 cs.Close                          ms.Close             return HttpUtility.UrlEncodeConvert.ToBase64Stringms.ToArray                   catch              return null       codepre

Negative 57 pI am working on web project. We are using flex as UI layer. My question is often we are writing core service layer separately from webUI layer so we can reuse same services for different UI layertechnology. So practically is it possible to reuse same core layer services without any changesaddition in API with different kind of UI technologieslayers. For e.g. same core service layer with UI technology which supports synchronized request response e.g. jsp etc. and non synchronize or event driven UI technology e.g Ajax, Flex, GWT etc. or with multiple devices like computers, mobiles, pdas etc.. Personally I feel its very tough to write core service layer without any knowledge of UI. Looking for thoughts from other people.p

I was able to refactor that consumer code into another class, and specify a generic type restriction there restricting it to codeclasscode which effectively makes that code not compile if someone were to remove the restriction on the class Im talking about above.p

Negative 57 pI have a heavy internet page who freezes when I add the fontface clause in its CSS. Everything seems to be loaded, but I dont see most of the page I can select the text and paste it somewhere, but it wont appear on the page itself. The font download seems to fail based on tests with AOL Pagetest plugin. After a lot of tests, it seems like its a timing thing. I added a sort of Sleep function in javascript and the page now loads most of the time, but still freezes sometimes It seems like the page tries to show before the font is fully downloaded, which freezes the interface.p  pDo you have any suggestion on how I could treat this problem in a better way than putting a Sleep of 2 seconds, because I dont find it really clean to do this, and, as the css of the page can be modified by the user, I dont have the control on how much fonts will need to be downloaded from the server and how heavy these files could be..p  pThank youp

Im trying to decide the best pattern to implement this.p  pstrongOption 1strong Subclass codeClassAcode and add the extra values. Have a common codeUpdatecode method that is overridden in the subclass. This is simple code in the model, but the code to create these classes needs to know which to create in advance, and any code that iterates over a list of these types needs to do type checking to deal with the extra fields.p  pstrongOption 2strong Have the extra properties in a separate class, and have the update code for codeCalculatedBcode there. The issue with this is that codeClassBcode then needs some way of knowing when codeValueAcode is updated, and I was hoping to not have to implement something like codeINotifyPropertyChangedcode on these classes. Another way to do this is to have some sort of public Update method on the extra properties class, and have the main class call that method when codeValueAcode is updated. Also not desirable.p  pstrongOption 3strong Just have codeClassBcode with codeValueBcode and codeCalculatedBcode being nullable types. Pass.p  pAre there any more Which would you choosep

How do you use a custom function with an NSPredicatep  pOr should I consider another approachp  pThanks.p  pUPDATEp  pI have figured out how to make the string containing filepaths into an expression that evaluates to what I want, using a category on NSString that adds the method codevalidatecode.

Negative 57 pHey there  just wondering if anyone knows the trick to getting icons to display on button in a JApplet. When I add the icon from a png in my package via the properties panel it turns up in the NetBeans IDE as expected but when I run the launch file it isnt there. I can confirm that the file exists in my Jar and no exceptions seem to be thrown in relation to missing files.p  pIf I create a similar application using a JForm and run it directly from NetBeans the icon appears as expected.p  pEDITp  pIt seems this is confined to Chrome... works correctly in IE9 and FF 3.6p  pEDITp  pReplicate as follows  no coding requiredp  pCreate a NetBeans 6.9.1 Project with the following settingsp  pJava  JavaApplicationp  p[Next]p  pName e.g. JavaApplication1p  pUntick Create Main Classp  p[Finish]p  pAdd a png image MyIcon to the src directory.p  pRight Click JavaApplication1 Project in Projects panel and select New  JApplet Formp  p[Finish]p  pDrag a button onto the form, right click  properties  icon and choose MyIcon from the prepopulated dropdown menu.

Negative 57 pI am in my first programming class and I am now reaching the end of the semester.  I have an online portfolio where I share my college accomplishments.  At this point in the semester, I would like to upload some of the simple Applets I have created to my online portfolio.  My portfolio is hosted on Weebly.com.  I tried uploading the files to the host site and using the simple  tags to run the applet within the html.  Im quite sure Im accessing the files using the correct directories.  But before we jump to any conclusions there, I decided I ought to run the applets locally to ensure Im doing everything correctly.  I am on a macbook pro running OS 10.6.6. In Java Preferences, my Java SE versions are Java SE 6 64bit and Java SE 6 32bit.  My plugin version is 1.6.0 found in SystemLibraryJavaJavaVirtualMachines.  These are the only versions I have on my machine.  My research tells me that I may be having version disagreements.  Some forums have suggested going back to plugin version 1.5 although, I have no idea how. Im pretty sure now though that apple has updated Safari to a 64bit version.  I have Eclipse set to 1.6 also.

Negative 57 pI am interested in finding how many disks are on each peg at a given move in the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTowerofHanoitowers of Hanoia puzzle. For example, given coden  3code disks we have this sequence of configurations for optimally solving the puzzlep  precode   0 1 2 0. 3 0 0 1. 2 0 1 move 0 gt 2 2. 1 1 1 move 0 gt 1 3. 1 2 0 move 2 gt 1 4. 0 2 1 move 0 gt 2 5. 1 1 1 move 1 gt 0 6. 1 0 2 move 1 gt 2 7. 0 0 3 move 0 gt 2 codepre  pSo given move number 5, I want to return code1 1 1code, given move number 6, I want code1 0 2code etc.p  pThis can easily be done by using the classical algorithm and stopping it after a certain number of moves, but I want something more efficient. The wikipedia page I linked to above gives an algorithm under the codeBinary solutionscode section. I think this is  wrong however. I also do not understand how they calculate codencode.p  pIf you follow their example and convert the disk positions it returns to what I want, it gives code4 0 4code for coden  8code disks and move number code216code. Using the classical algorithm however, I get code4 2 2code.p  pThere is also an efficient algorithm implemented in C a hrefhttphanoitower.mkolar.orgmoves.htmlconf2herea that also gives code4 2 2code as the answer, but it lacks documentation and I dont have access to the paper its based on.p  pThe algorithm in the previous link seems correct, but can anyone explain how exactly it worksp  pA few related questions that Im also interested inp  ol liIs the wikipedia algorithm really wrong, or am I missing something And how do they calculate codencodeli liI only want to know how many disks are on each peg at a certain move, not on what peg each disk is on, which is what the literature seems to be more concerned about.

Negative 57 pWorking in Linux and using C. I have a program which initiates a thread.

Negative 57 pIm modifying an existing query for a client, and Ive encountered a somewhat baffling issue. p  pOur client uses SQL Server 2008 R2 and the database in question provides the user the ability to specify custom fields for one of its tables by making use of an EAV structure. All of the values stored in this structure are codevarchar255code, and several of the fields are intended to store dates. The query in question is being modified to use two of these fields and compare them one is a start, the other is an end against the current date to determine which row is current.p  pThe issue Im having is that part of the query does a codeCONVERTDateTime, eav.Valuecode in order to turn the codevarcharcode into a codeDateTimecode. The conversions themselves all succedd and I can include the value as part of the codeSELECTcode clause, but part of the question is giving me a conversion errorp  precodeConversion failed when converting date andor time from character string. codepre  pThe real kicker is this if I define the base for this query getting a list of entities with the two custom field values flattened into a single row as a view and select against the view and filter the view by codegetdatecode, then it works correctly, but it fails if I add a join to a second table using one of the nondate fields from the view. I realize that this might be somewhat hard to follow, so I can post an example query if desired, but this question is already getting a little long.p  pIve tried recreating the basic structure in another database and including sample data, but the new database behaves as expected, so Im at a loss here.p  pstrongEDITstrong In case its useful, heres the statement for the viewp  precodecreate view Festival as  select     e.EntityId as FestivalId,     e.LookupAs as FestivalName,     convertDate, nvs.Value as ActivityStart,     convertDate, nve.Value as ActivityEnd  from tblEntity e  left join CustomControl ccs on ccs.ShortName  Activity Start Date left join CustomControl cce on cce.ShortName  Activity End Date left join tblEntityNameValue nvs on nvs.CustomControlId  ccs.IdCustomControl and nvs.EntityId  e.EntityId left join tblEntityNameValue nve on nve.CustomControlId  cce.IdCustomControl and nve.EntityId  e.EntityId  where e.EntityType  Festival codepre  pThe failing query is thisp  precodeselect    from Festival f  join FestivalAttendeeAll fa on fa.FestivalId  f.FestivalId  where getdate between f.ActivityStart and f.ActivityEnd codepre  pYet this worksp  precodeselect    from Festival f  where getdate between f.ActivityStart and f.ActivityEnd codepre  pcodeEntityIdcodecodeFestivalIdcode are int columnsp

Negative 57 pRFC 3986 specifies that the a hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmlrfc3986section3.2.2host componenta of a URI is case insensitive.  However, it doesnt specify what case insensitive means in terms of UCS or UTF8 characters.p  pExamples given in the RFC e.g. codeltHTTPwww.EXAMPLE.comcode is equivalent to codelthttpwww.example.comcode allow us to infer that case insensitive means at least that the characters AZ are considered equivalent to the character 32 ahead of them in the UTF8 character set, i.e. az.  However, no mention is made of how characters outside this range should be treated.  So, given an nonencoded, nonnormalised registered name of www.OL.com, I see three potential forms of normalisation permissible by the RFCp  ol liLower case to www.ol.com then percent encode to www.olE9.comli liLower case only AZ characters to www.ol.com and then percent encode to www.olC9.comli liPercent encode to www.OLC9.com, and then lower case the nonpercent encoded parts to www.olC9.com, producing the same result as 2.li ol  pSo the question is  Which is correct  If its case 1., what defines which characters are considered upper case, and which are considered lower case and which characters dont have a casep

Negative 57 pIm trying to calculate the cross correlation between a template image an image which is part of a bigger image, to the image which the template belongs to.p  pSuppose the template image is 3x2 and the large image is 20x20. What i did first is grayscaled both images. Then i got the mean of the gray values again for both. After that i checked pixel by pixel if the current pixel is lower or higher than the mean. If its lower then i colored the pixel black, if its higher then the pixel will be white. So basically this leaves me with a binary image. Where 1white and 0black.p  pMy template image binary value is 101010p  pThen in the large image i start scanning each pixel to see if it matches the template. So i start at x0, y0 in the big image and i compare the first three pixel on the X axis from the first two rows on the Y axis with the ones of the template image. The binary value for that is 111010p  pSo the next step is to check the correlation, right Now heres the tricky part for me because im not sure if im doing it right. But this is what ive come up withp  h2101010 template imageh2  pSum  3p  pMean  0.5p  pStandard Deviation  4,2p  h2111010 big image, first sectionh2  pSum  4p  pMean  0,66p  pStandard Deviation  2,82p  pThen i tried to calculate the correlation like sop  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCBh9m.jpg altenter image description herep  pWhich got me the following result r  0,04p  pSince this number isnt close to 1 at all, this means there is no close correlation right Or maybe i have to compare it to n2  the critical value. So in this case, 62  4. Since it isnt close to 4 either this also means that there is no correlation, rightp  pAnd what does it mean when its close to 1, does this mean that there is even less correlationp  pAnd most important, are my calculation correct.. Or am i still missing something..p

Negative 57 pIve been struggling with how I should indicate that a certain record in a database is the fallback or default entry. Ive also been struggling with how to reduce my problem to a simple problem statement. Im going to have to provide an example.p  pSuppose that you are building a very simple shipping application. Youll take orders and will need to decide which warehouse to ship them from.p  pLets say that you have a few cities that have their own dedicated warehouses if an order comes in from one of those cities, youll ship from that citys warehouse. If an order comes in from any other city, you want to ship from a certain other warehouse. Well call that certain other warehouse the fallback warehouse.p  pYou might decide on a schema like thisp  precodeWarehouses     WarehouseId     Name  WarehouseCities     WarehouseId     CityName codepre  pThe solution must enforce zero or one fallback warehouses.p  pYou need a way to indicate which warehouse should be used if there arent any warehouses specified for the city in question. If it really matters, youre doing this on SQL Server 2008.p  pEDIT To be clear, strongall valid cities are NOT present in the WarehouseCities tablestrong. It is possible for an order to be received for a City not listed in WarehouseCities. In such a case, we need to be able to select the fallback warehouse.p  pIf any number of default warehouses were allowed, or if I was assigning default warehouses to, say, states, I would use a DefaultWarehouse table. I could use such a table here, but I would need to limit it to exactly one row, which doesnt feel right. p  pHow would you indicate the fallback warehouse p  hr  psupOf course, in this example we discount the possibility that there might be multiple cities with the same name. The country you are building this application for rigorously enforces a uniqueness constraint on all city names.supp

My problem is that when i find the ones that are overlapping and delete them i get an index error. I believe the problem is something to do with using del and my for loops max which i get using the len of the array. The code also works sometimes if nothing overlaps and triggers the removed calls.

Negative 57 pSo, I have a postgresql database and Im querying a particular columns values and assigning each value to a javascript array.

Negative 57 pI have a parser written in Perl which parses file of fixed length records. Part of the record consists of several strings also fixed length, made of numbers only. Each character in the string is encoded as number, not as ASCII char. I.e., if I have string 12345, its encoded as 01 02 03 04 05 instead of 31 32 33 34 35. p  pI parse the record with unpack, and this particular part is unpacked as codearray  unpack C44, scode. Then I recover needed string with simple join, like codem  join, arraycode. p  pI was wondering if thats an optimal way to decode. Files are quite big, millions of records, and obviously I tried to look if its possible to optimize. Profiler shows that most of the time is spent in parsing the records i.e., reading, writing, and other stuff is not a problem, and in parsing most of the time has been taken by these joins. I remember from other sources that join is quite efficient operation. Any ideas if its possible to speed code more or is it optimal already Perhaps it would be possible to avoid this intermediate array in some clever way, e.g., use packunpack combination insteadp  pstrongEdited code examplestrongp  pThe code which I try to optimise looks like thisp  precode    while readREAD, buf, recl  recl          my s  unpack A24 C44 H8, buf         my msisdn  substr s[0], 0, 11         my address  join, s[4..14]         my imsi  join, s[25..39]         my ts  localtimehexs[45]      codepre

There is one Effect object for each bullet point.  My addin converts them from being triggered by on click to running automatically.

This causes the separate Effect objects for each bullet point to be replaced by one Effect for all the bullet points.  So, that all the bullet points are displayed on the screen at once rather than with a delay in between them.  It doesnt matter if I insert the audio first or modify the bullet effects first.p  pTheres got to be a way to set the audio to play automatically with out messing up the other Effects since you can do it in the GUI.  Can anyone help  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 57 pWarning I know very little about database collations so apologies in advance if any of this is obvious...p  pWeve got a database column that contains urls. Wed like to place a unique constraintindex on this column. p  pIts come to my attention that under the default db collation codeLatin1GeneralCIAScode, dupes exist in this column because for instance the url codehttp1.2.3.45678someResourcecode and codehttp1.2.3.45678SomeResourcecode are considered equal. Frequently this is not the case... the kind of server this url points at strongisstrong case sensitive.p  pWhat would be the most appropriate collation for such a column Obviously casesensitivity is a must, but codeLatin1Generalcode Are urls codeLatin1Generalcode Im not bothered about a lexicographical ordering, but equality for unique indexesgrouping is important.p

Negative 57 pIm having an issue with some MFC printing code lately. To describe the issue at a high level, were getting problems when we try to print the same document twice.

The first time, the document prints fine. The second time, the program crashes with an uncaught exception.p  pThis also only started happening after a recent upgrade. This is code that Ive literally never touched. It worked fine in version 5 when we were using VS2005 and MFC8.

Negative 57 pIm new to codewxWidgetscode and codeDialogBlockscode.  I have a form that is created using DialogBlocks and saved as an XRC file. Part of the form has a vertical codewxStaticBoxSizercode into which are placed two codewxScrolledWindowcode elements.  I want to only show one at a time based on what data is to be shown to the user, so I have one marked hidden and left the other one visible. When I try to switch the display and show the widget that was hidden in the XRC and hide the one that was not, the one that I hide goes away fine, but the one that I want to show is not visible. If I resize the window however, it appears.  Once it has appeared then I can switch back and forth with no issues.  I tried many combinations of showing, enabling, invalidating, getting the sizer and calling codeRecalcSizescode, refresh, layout, and some others.  I tried them in different combinations too.  Simply calling codeShowcode will allow me to toggle between the two, but only after I switch to the one that does not show initially and resize the window. From what I see in the docs. the issue is that codewxSizercode doesnt allocate space for hidden windows, but there is a flag that can be set to override that behavor.  My problem is that DialogBlocks does not expose that feature, so if I manually edit the XRC file the modification will be lost when I, or one of the other developers, save, some changes. Is there a sequence of calls that I can make to tell the sizer to allocate space  The default codeOnResizecode handler does something to cause the sizer to allocate space, but I dont know what that is, or how to do it.  p  pThis is the flag I found in the docsp  blockquote   pwxRESERVESPACEEVENIFHIDDEN  Normally wxSizers dont allocate space   for hidden windows  or other items. This flag overrides this behavior   so that sufficient space is allocated for the window even if it isnt   visible. This makes it possible to dynamically show and hide controls   without resizing parent dialog, for example. This function is new   since wxWidgets version 2.8.8p blockquote

Negative 57 phi there im working on an assignment about using POSIX threads with multi semaphores. the brief explanation of assignment is there are 4 various data packets charvideoaudioimage, each of them carried by a different thread and also we have a shared buffer. maximum threads can work on system will be maintained by the user as an input. for example if user enters 10 then maximum 10 thread could be created to transmit data packets over a buffer in a given time. now the confusing part for me is, this buffer can contains limited packets instantly. for example it can contain maximum 10 char packets and 20 video packets etc. so we have to have different semaphores for each data type. the issue i know how to control the buffer size with semaphore which is very simple, but cant set the correct idea of using semaphores of packets. even i tried some different methods i always faced with deadlock errors. here is my pseudocode to understand more clearly of my program.p  precodedefine struct packege define semaphore list  main  initialize variables and semaphores  while threadCounter is less than MaxThreadNumber  switchrandom case 0 create a character package     create a thread to insert the package in buffer case 1 create a video package     create a thread to insert the package in buffer case 2 create an image package     create a thread to insert the package in buffer case 3 create an audio package     create a thread to insert the package in buffer  increment  threadCounter by one end of while  create only one thread which will make the dequeue operation end of main  producer function  for igt0 to sizeofpackage     semwaitemptybuffer  decrement emptybuffer semaphore by size of package      lockmutex         insert item into queueu         decrement counter of the buffer by size of package     unlockmutex  for igt0 to sizeofpackage     sempostfullbuffer  increment fullbuffer semaphore by size of package  end of producer function  consumer function  while TRUE  Loops forever      lockmutex          if queue is not empty             dequeue          increment counter of the buffer size of package      unlockmutex  for igt0 to sizeofpackage  The reason why i making the semwait operation here is i cant make the dequeue in outer region of mutex.     semwaitfullbuffer for igt0 to sizeofpackage     sempostemptybuffer end of consumer function codepre  pwith this implementation programe works correctly. but i couldnt use semaphores properly which belongs to threads of packages. i can listen every recommandation and will be appreciated for every answer.p

Negative 57 pI am struggling with achieving a requirement on a current system.p  pThe system is intended to manage costs and project details and is currently provided through an Excel based solution. Each project consists of a number of weeks which are represented by columns, with a variety of data items presented on the rows. Project lengths are such that many projects have in excess of 150 columns. Columns and data items can be added dynamically, and the user wants to be able to navigate quickly around the grid using keyboard controls.p  pThe business is moving from this unsupported Excel based solution to an application written in C with a WPF front end, but the users still want a solution close to their existing spreadsheet. I have initially tried to implement this using the Telerik WPF grid control that I have used elsewhere using dynamicexpando objects to hold the data and using the AutoGeneratingColumn event to create the controls for each of the columns. Initially the performance was acceptable but I had to turn off column and row virtualisation to enable the user to be able to tab through the fields, and this has resulted in a dramatic reduction in performance particularly when adding new rows and using filtering.p  pIs a grid control the right method to accomplish this requirement  could another thirdparty grid handle the dynamic column creation better  or is there an alternative design that could achieve both the performance and user interface requirementsp

Negative 57 pEvery so often I am tasked with making alterations to one or more business entities in our database that may already be cached in our internal application. To get the application to reflect these changes without cycling the app pool, I figured Id embed the ability for devadministrators to evict the cache from within the apps UI either entirely or for certain objects, but I noticed the comments for the method state the following...p  precode ltsummarygt  Evict an entry from the processlevel cache.  This method occurs outside      of any transaction it performs an immediate hard remove, so does not respect      any transaction isolation semantics of the usage strategy.  Use with care.  ltsummarygt void ISessionFactory.EvictType persistentClass, object id codepre  pWhat exactly does that mean What could go wrong if I try to evict one or more objects that may be involved in a transaction, and is there anyway to avoid these side effects if they are destructive Im currently using SysCache2 and am looking for implementation details on how to use SqlDependency but Im still curious about the Evict effects in the mean time.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Upon looking closer at the comments, it appears that codeSessionFactory.Evictcode and codeSessionFactory.EvictCollectioncode remove from the process level cache, and codeSessionFactory.EvictEntitycode remove from the second level cache. However the same disclaimer exists on either flavor. So my original question still stands. What dangers are there of evicting an entity from the cache process or second level if its currently in use in another transactionp

Negative 57 pIm developing an android game using OpenGL ES 2.0. Some of my users about 5 face such problem after lockingunlocking device or after pressing home button and resuming the app gray screen appears. I mean this happens after calling onResume and onPause.p  pScreen is gray because background is filled with this colorp  precodeGLES20.glClearColor.5f, .5f, .5f, 1f codepre  pThis means than after resuming the app nothing is drawn on some phones.p  pIm using virtual buffer objects upload all buffers to GPU.

Negative 57 pI have a function called getchapter which takes a page number as an argument and returns a unique string representing the chapter the page belongs to, for example The Story Continues. If I enter a page number outside the book, I am returned an empty string.  p  pThe first page is page 0. Chapters are a set of consecutive pages and a given page belongs to only one chapter.p  pWhat algorithm would you recommend which can identify the page ranges for each chapter Any estimate as to how many times I would need to call getchapterp  pI need to limit calls to getchapter as much as possible. Chapters average 50000 pages. And there are approximately 30000000 pages in the book Not sure how many chapters exist.p

Negative 57 pstrongBackgroundstrong I have a Bluetooth gamepad which I can discover and connect to through xCode. I can communicate with it through the Control and Interrupt channel and thus I can find out which buttons on the Gamepad are being pressed. I can then map this to a keyboard button. p  pHowever, most recent games look for an actual gamepad or joystick to enable multiplayer functions as only one player is allowed to play on the keyboard and mouse. Since my gamepad currently only simulates the keyboard buttons the game does not recognize a gamepad and thus will not unlock the multiplayer mode.p  pstrongQuestionstrong I have no idea where to look for, but is there a way I can simulate a gamepad so the MAC actually recognizes it as a joystickgamepad and I can map the buttons accordinglyp  pI am coding in xCode 4.6.1 for a Mac OSX Mountain Lion APP.p

Negative 57 pI want to setup my mail server in a way so that if someone sends email to codeuserexample.comcode itll be directed to codeusercodes inbox. This is not mail box. Rather its a chat platform. So communication should be real time. The workflow is,p  ol liSomeone sends an email to codeuserexample.comcode.li licodeusercode gets a chat window with that message.li ol  pI can solve it by writing a program that polls the mail server each min and check for new messages. If found it just send a chat message. But that not realtime.  Another option could be adding some sort of plugin to the mail server that does the work.  I havent setup any mail server yet. Ill setup only that mail server that helps me to do this.p  pI am using Python, PHP. So any solution using those two language is welcomed. If all else fails I guess I have to write plugin in C. p

Negative 57 pIt been happening for a while now, that every time I make changes to my code and compile, the behavior of program wont reflect the changes I made. What i have to do to get a change is to clean my project and compile all the files again. Visual studio shouldnt be doing this and its starting get in the way of actually debugging my code to begin with as the program is large and it takes a while to compile.p  pHow can I fix this so I dont have to go through this ritual of cleaning then compiling just to see changes.p

Negative 57 pI wrote a super simple ATL dialog inside a project. Even when I noted that every example on the web implemented the CDialogImpl class inline that is, the class definition and its implmentation where in the definition itself I wrote it normally, separating my definition in a .h file and implementation in a .cpp file. This class is summarized belowp  h2CMainDialog.hpph2  precodeclass CMainDialog public CDialogImplltCMainDialoggt  public     enum  IDD  IDDMYDIALOGSDIALOG      BEGINMSGMAPCMainDialog         MESSAGEHANDLERWMINITDIALOG, OnInitDialog         COMMANDIDHANDLERIDCANCEL, OnCancel     ENDMSGMAP      CMainDialog     CMainDialog      LRESULT OnInitDialogUINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam,          BOOLamp bHandled      LRESULT OnCancelUINT uMsg, WORD wID, HWND hWndCtl, BOOLamp bHandled  codepre  h2CMainDialog.cpph2  precodeCMainDialogCMainDialog   CMainDialogCMainDialog   LRESULT CMainDialogOnInitDialogUINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam,      BOOLamp bHandled   LRESULT CMainDialogOnCancelUINT uMsg, WORD wID, HWND hWndCtl,                                BOOLamp bHandled   codepre  pIf I call this class from the same project, everything goes fine. The dialog shows.

So, if I create a new ATL project, reference my newly created library and call CMainDialog.DoModal ... well, nothing happens. The constructor does get called, but the messages never start dispatching and the program ends inmediatly. Maybe Im missing somethingp  pIm totally new to Win32 programming although definitely not new to c so any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 57 pI am looking into various technologies associated with formatting data into document form.  There are many software platforms to do so, but most are quite expensive.p  pI stumbled upon XSLFO and have been looking deeper into it to see if it may fit my needs.  But so far I have not been able to answer this question.  Can it be used to create multiple documents into a single streamp  pFOP can create AFP the print language my company uses for mass printings and it works pretty well I would need to do more font configuration to make it truly worthwhile.  But I have not yet seen any evidence that XSLFO can create hundreds, thousands, or in my case hundreds of thousands of documents statements in a single print stream.p  pOne more question for anyone who knows FOP... can it index TLEs, NOPs, etc. documents in an AFP streamp  pemstrongADDITIONAL INFORMATIONemstrongp  pI do not have any code to showshare because this little project is in the research phase.  I would dearly love to know if XSLFO will meet my needs BEFORE I spend the next 46 months buried in books, tutorials, and manuals, coding something together, only to find it cant do what I need.p  pWhat I am looking for is a way to create multiple documents in a single print stream AFP for spooling to commercial printers.  I found fop as an opensource Javabased converter for turning XSLFO to AFP or PDF, or a host of other outputs.p  pFor these purposes, a document may be defined as follows a group of pagesimpressions that begin with page 1.p  pSo far, I have not seen how XSLFO can produce anything other than a single document at a time.  Granted, my foray into XSL is in its infancy, which is why Ive sought answers here.p  pSome potential answers to this question that would not surprise me might bep  pYes, XSLFO can do this... look into the emfonewdocumentem tag.p  pNo, XSLFO is intended to create a single document.  To produce multiple documents, you need to either use a thirdparty piece of software or postprocess the XSLFO to fake multiple documents.p  pIf the answer is yes, then I will pursue this further.  If the answer is yes, but it costs money, then I will pursue other avenues that also cost money but that are far easier to develop with.  If the answer is no, then I will again pursue other avenues.p  pI hope this clarifies my query.

Negative 57 pIm currently exploring ways to hide mail addresses from spam bots. I dont want to insert pictures. JavaScripting to hide addresses and decrypt them onclick is a neat option, but then I also want people to be able to hightlight the address and then copy paste it in their preferred mail client.p  pSo I came up with the idea to insert spans with userselect none, so this will prevent the user from highlighting it, but it will still be copied at least in Chrome.p  pI dont want to use a popup as suggested in another thread a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions400212howtocopytotheclipboardinjavascriptherea. What I could imagine is a small popover below when hovering over the link ... something like Send mail and when you hover over it, a small box will appear below with the correct mail address decrypted right then by JavaScript. The downside is that users might not be aware of this method and fail to find the address.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 57 pI have a code that has two Python functions, run, and dudtu, t, .... run calls a C function, odepackodeint, which calls a Fortran subroutine, LSODA, which calls another C function, odefunction, which calls dudt.

Negative 57 pThis is kind of a neat problem and Ive enjoyed thinking it through...p  pAssume that you run a Widget Rental website, and on your application and you want to allow prospective purchasers to sort the widgets based on prices. Low to high or high to low. p  pEach widget can have a different price based on the time of year. Some widgets will have dozens of different prices depending on the season as you get high seasons and low seasons. p  pHowever, the sellers of the Widgets are strongespecially mischievousstrong, and have realised that if they set their widget to be really expensive for one day of the year, and also really cheap one day of the year, then they can easily appear at the low and high sort ranges.p  pCurrently, I took a very naive solution in order to calculate the lowest price for a Widget, which is to just take the codelowest N code value from a dataset. p  pWhat I would like to is to get a lowest from price for a widget, which accurately portrays the price which it could be rented from.. and remove the lowerhigherband outliers.p  pTake a look at this chart... with values...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXSK90.png altChartp  blockquote   pX Axis  Time each significant interval is a dayp      pY Axis  Pricep blockquote  pThe X axis is time, and the Y axis is the price. Now, this contains a normal distribution, and there arent any real statistical outliers in that dataset. Its common to see the price between the lowest value and the upper value to fluctuate as much as 200. p  pHowever, take a look at this second chart... It contains a single day tariff, which is only 20 uros... p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comcreNt.png altenter image description herep  pIve played around with using Grubbs test and it seems to work quite well. p  pThe important thing is that I want to get a from price. That is to say, I want to be able to say, You can rent this widget from XXXX.

Negative 57 pTrying to address a hrefhttpsgithub.comfacebooktornadoissues868this issuea, Im trying to wrap my head around the various functions in the Python standard library aimed at supporting a hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmlrfc2231RFC 2231a. The main aim of that RFC appears to be threefold allowing nonASCII encoding in header parameters, noting the language of a given value, and allowing header parameters to span multiple lines. The a hrefhttpdocs.python.org3libraryemail.util.htmlemail.utils.decoderfc2231codeemail.utilcode librarya provides several functions to deal with various aspects of this. As far as I can tell, they work as followsp  pa hrefhttpdocs.python.org3libraryemail.util.htmlemail.utils.decoderfc2231codedecoderfc2231codea only splits the value of such a parameter into its parts, like thisp  precodegtgtgt email.utils.decoderfc2231utf8TC3A4st.txt [utf8, , TC3A4st.txt] codepre  pa hrefhttpdocs.python.org3libraryemail.util.htmlemail.utils.decodeparamscodedecodeparamscodea takes care of detecting RFC2231encoded parameters. It collects parts which belong together, and also decodes the urlencoded string to a byte sequence. This byte sequence, however, is then encoded as latin1. And all values are enclosed in quotation marks. Furthermore, there is some special handling for the first argument, which still has to be a tuple of two elements, but those two get passed to the result without modification.p  precodegtgtgt email.utils.decodeparams[ ...   1,2, ...   foo,bar, ...   name,utf8TC3A4st.txt, ...   baz0,two,baz1,part] [1, 2, foo, bar, baz, twopart, name, utf8, , Tst.txt] codepre  pa hrefhttpdocs.python.org3libraryemail.util.htmlemail.utils.collapserfc2231valuecodecollapserfc2231valuecodea can be used to convert this triple of encoding, language and byte sequence into a proper unicode string. What has me confused, though, is the fact that if the input was such a triple, then the quotes will be carried over to the output. If, on the other hand, the input was a single quoted string, then these quotes will be removed.p  precodegtgtgt [k, email.utils.collapserfc2231valuev for k, v in ...  email.utils.decodeparams[ ...   1,2, ...   foo,bar, ...   name,utf8TC3A4st.txt, ...   baz0,two,baz1,part][1]] [foo, bar, baz, twopart, name, Tst.txt] codepre  pSo it seems that in order to use all this machinery, Id have to add yet another step to unquote the third element of any tuple Id encounter. Is this true, or am I missing some point here I had to figure out a lot of the above with help from the source code, since the docs are a bit vague on the details. I cannot imagine what could be the point behind this selective unquoting. Is there a point to itp  pstrongWhat is the best reference on how to use these functionsstrongp  pThe best I found so far is the a hrefhttpdocs.python.org3libraryemail.message.htmlemail.message.Messagecodeemail.message.Messagecodea a hrefhttphg.python.orgcpythonfilec3896275c0f6Libemailmessage.pyimplementationa. There, the process seems to be roughly the one outlined above, but every field gets unquoted via a hrefhttphg.python.orgcpythonfilec3896275c0f6Libemailmessage.pyl95codeunquotevaluecodea after the codedecodeparamscode, and only a hrefhttpdocs.python.org3libraryemail.message.htmlemail.message.Message.getfilenamecodegetfilenamecodea and a hrefhttpdocs.python.org3libraryemail.message.htmlemail.message.Message.getboundarycodegetboundarycodea collapse their values, all others return a tuple instead. I hope there is something more useful.p

Negative 57 pSo, Ive fitted an exponential curve to some data points using fit and now I want to get the equation of the fitted curve in the Legend in the graph. How can I do that I want to have an equation on the form yCext in the legend.

The main problem is how I should get out the coefficients from the fitted line Ive plotted. Then I want to have the equation inside the legend in my graph. Do I have to take out the coefficients by hand and how can it be done or can Matlab write it straight out like in, for example, excelp

Negative 57 pI am having some issues with a Wicket ListPanel. The whole ListPanel is refreshed via Ajax from a filter that is defined on the same page. This schema works quite well under normal circumstances. p  pOne part of the ListPanel is a component that needs some specific JS and CSS files for its proper functioning. These are declared in the wickethead section of the specific component.p  pWhen the page is loaded for the first time and the list has at least one item, everything works fine. However, when the list is empty when page is rendered, the child component of the ListPanel is never loaded and the CSSJS imports are not considered. If, afterwards you refresh the DIV with an AJAX request, the wickethead section of that component is not reloaded, so the Javascript code is broken.p  pMy assumption is that Wicket will consider the wickethead section during normal page render, but not when a component is updated via AJAX. p  pSo, my question is, what would be a good approach to get the resources I need without having to push the imports up to a component that doesnt use the resources directly I know pushing them up to other components or the page will do the job, but I dont really think its clean, I like to have things where they belong, and if a component is the only one to use some resources, they should only be loaded there.p
Negative 57 pI am facing the following scenariop  pMy application contains a lot of information stored in classes, the user can search the information for specific words similar to the file search in Windows.p  pOnce the user hit the search button, the search should begin asynchronously and collect results in the background. The search process can take a long time. Lets say the class which handles the searching is called SearchService SearchService.cs.p  pThe user can open a results view while the search service is working which contains a datagrid of results that is required to be updated as more results are found.p  pSo basicallyp  pService is collecting information asynchronously  View Model should get the already existing results and should be notified of new results  View with datagrid should be updated asynchronouslyp  pHow should I implement this Lets say the View Model exposes an ObservableCollection to the view, but how should that collection be updated from the servicep  pI am using Prism and MEF.p

Negative 57 pId like to create a small p2p application that concurrently processes incoming data from other known  trusted nodes it mostly stores it in an SQLite database. In order to recognize these nodes, upon connecting, each node introduces itself and my application then needs to check whether it knows this node directly or maybe indirectly through another node. Hence, I need to do a graph search which obviously needs processing time and which Id like to outsource to a separate process or even multiple worker processes See my 2nd question below. Also, in some cases it is necessary to adjust the graph, add new edges or vertices.p  pLets say I have strong4 worker processesstrong accepting and handling incoming connections via asynchronous IO. strongWhats the best way for them to access read  modify the graphstrong A single queue obviously doesnt do the trick for read access because I need to pass the search results back somehow.p  pHence, one way to do it would be another queue which would be filled by the graph searching process and which I could add to the event loop. The event loop could then pass the results to a handler. However, this eventcallbackbased approach would make it necessary to also always pass the corresponding sockets to the callbacks and thus to the Queue  which is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16386678toomanyopenfilespythonmultiprocesstcpservernastya because sockets are not picklable. Let alone the fact that callbacks lead to spaghetti code.p  pAnother idea thats just crossed my mind might be to create a pipe to the graph process for each incoming connection and then, on the graphs side, do asynchronous IO as well. However, in order to avoid callbacks, if I understand correctly, I would need an async IO library making use of codeyield fromcode i.e. a hrefhttpwww.python.orgdevpepspep3156 relnofollowtulip  PEP 3156a. Are there other optionsp  pRegarding async IO on strongthe graphs sidestrong This is certainly the best way to handle many incoming requests at once but doing graph lookups is a CPU intensive task, thus strongcould profit from using multiple worker threads or processesstrong. strongThe problem isstrong Multiple threads allow shared data but Pythons GIL somewhat negates the performance benefit. Multiple processes on the other hand dont have this problem but how can I share and synchronize data between them For me it seems quite impossible to split up a graph. Is there any way to solve this problem in a nice way Also, does it make sense in terms of performance to mix asynchronous IO with multithreading  multiprocessingp

What is the benefit of each option What is the real difference between themp  pThis is what I have found p  blockquote precodetransclude true codepre      pInside a compile function, you can manipulate the DOM with the help of transclude linking function or you can insert the transcluded DOM into the template using ngTransclude directive on any HTML tag. p blockquote  pandp  blockquote precodetransclude element codepre      pThis transcludes the entire element and a transclude linking function is introduced in the compile function. You can not have access to scope here because the scope is not yet created. Compile function creates a link function for the directive which has access to scope and transcludeFn lets you touch the cloned element which was transcluded for DOM manipulation or make use of data bound to scope in it. For your information, this is used in ngrepeat and ngswitch.p blockquote

Negative 57 pI got an application that displays some items loaded from a webservice e.g. Fruits. These items rarely change. You can also show availability of those items e.g. for apples, 10kg is available at store A today, 20kg tomorrow, ...p  pThe user can bookmark some of those items on his phone. I need the user to be able to bookmark some of these items and to have his bookmarks synchronized between devices I bookmark apples on my phone, I expect to see apples bookmarked in my tablet next time I open the app there.p  pMore or less, I got around 40 items, no more. And each availability data would total to around 200 entries.p  pWhich technique would you use to implement that p  pMy idea so farp  ol liI build a sqlite database with contentprovider of fruits and availabilities li liI synchronize this DB every 23 days that is enough, no need to do it more oftenli liI use a BackupAgent to synchronize the whole DB fileli ol  pDo you think a database is overkill The application is expected to always be ran with network connectivity else we dont allow it.p  pMy other option would have beenp  ol liLoad items and availability on application startli libookmarks are kept within SharedPreferencesli liI use a BackupAgent to synchronize only SharedPreferencesli ol  pThis seems less complicated, and more efficient on the sync part. However, I feel that is not really a clean way to do it and less futureproof.p

Negative 57 pI am developing a ZF2 based site. I have a main navigation which stays same regardless of the visitoruser status.

In the factory, I access the Authentication and RBAC and add the pages depending on the the users statusrole.li liI create a fully loaded navigation with all the possible pages, then in the factory, with the help of Authentication and RBAC I hide the pages I dont want to show.li lird option is to use a view helper which will get RBAC via ServiceLayer and generate the navigation. As discussed in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18790856zf2howtodisplaytweetsinlayoutZF2 how to display tweets in layouta and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16793655zf2addaloginwidgetinthetemplateZF2  Add a Login widget in the templatea.li liOr I can create a controllerplugin or just a method in module.php, and listen to the MVCRender or MVCDispatch event and generate the desired navigation and add the output to a view variable.li ol  pPS I need to use a partial as I need to add some CSS class to the language selection section. Also the navigation will be displayed in the layout.p

I would like to make my app compatible for WP7.xp  pI know I have to remove speech recognition from my app to support WP7p  p1  Where should I start  Could I use the same project on Visual Studio 2013 or should I create another project on Visual Studio 2012  p  p2 Is it simpler to target only WP7.8 or can I do WP7.5 and WP7.8 in a same project p  p3  I want to keep the use of asyncawait method, can I do that in WP7.8 or WP7.5 p  pThanks a lot for your answerp

Negative 57 pi have a table with header row designed in xml. Now i want to add data in the table  which i get from json array. I need to scroll data rows vertically without affecting header row, so i created another tablelayout just below the table of header row. Then for each field of each new row, i set layout params in java file and then add the row to second table layout. But no rows are visible while data is getting printed in the log.I cant figure out where is my mistake.p  pXMLp  precode    ltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout

Negative 57 pWe already have a quite complex mobile backend written in Java which is deployed and works fine, so we do not have any need to use the Google mobile backend.

However when I revisit the page to edit one of my use cases previously formatted text is damaged...  Typically if I have right aligned some text it strips tags from it forcing a left align and a codegtcode is added to the end of the codetextareacode.  You can imagine the confusion that gets introduced from there.  If you dont catch the codegtcode and save it removes all text with only the codegtcode surviving and a subsequent save will leave you with codeampgtcode saved to the database.p  pWhere might this problem be coming from  I have been unable to find anyone having a similar problem searching around thus far.p  pThanks in advance for your helpp  pstrongEditstrongp  pPerhaps the problem has nothing to do with CLEditor...

Negative 57 pI want to implement a questionanswer system an ORACLE APEX Application that uses the JQueryMobile Framework.

Negative 57 pFirst of all, design I need some kind of tree, where each node can have arbitrary number of children. Each node carries a payload. The total payload of the node is the payload of the specific node  payloads of all its ancestors till the root node.p  pOperations expected to be performed on the tree are insertion, updating, deletion rather frequently, merging subtrees into the tree less frequently. There is also an operation of changing the subtrees position in the tree, with consequent recomputing of the payloads of the node AND all of its descendants.p  pThe concrete implementation could be anything from just a plain persistent map to the specifically designed MySQL schema NoSQL solutions are taken into consideration too.

Negative 57 pIm using llvmmc with the goal of making a relatively smart disassembler identifying and tracking locals, easily following branches, etc, and part of that is creating a string representation of the disassembled instructions.p  pWhen I started this, I expected that I would be able to relatively easily identify registers and values used by codeMCInstcodes and whip out another representation myself with which I could easily work with. However, after some investigation, I realized that the correlation between the operands shown with the textual representation of an instruction and the operands that are actually present within the codeMCInstcode object is fairly low. Here are a few examples Intel syntaxp  ul liMoving, say, 11587 as a 32bit immediate into codeeaxcode would be done with the codeMOV32ricode opcode. The textual representation would be codemov eax, 11587code. The corresponding codeMCInstcode would have two operands, a register and an immediate. This works for me. This is great.li liAdding code11587code to codeeaxcode would be done with the codeADD32ricode opcode. The textual representation would be codeadd eax, 11587code. However, this time, the corresponding codeMCInstcode has emthreeem operands codeeaxcode is there twice and the immediate is in the end. This isnt so great. I can assume that this is an artifact of the lowering process, that the first instance of codeeaxcode is the destination register and that the second one is there to be the source even though x86 does not distinguish between the two, and I can hack around that.li liMoving a 32bits codeeipcoderelative value to codeeaxcode would be done with the codeMOV32ao32code opcode. The textual representation would be codemov eax, dword ptr [11587]code. In this case, the codeMCInstcode doesnt even have an operand for codeeaxcode, it can only be inferred from the operand type present in the opcode name. I can hack around that too, but things are getting less and less pretty and Ive only run into 56 different opcodes out of Godonlyknows how many opcodes x86 supports.li ul  pObviously, for the purpose of showing text, I could get the textual representation with an codeMCInstPrintercode, but the mapping between whats shown there and what the codeMCInstcode has is still muddy.p  pIs there a straightforward way to tell which operands appears in the textual representation of an instructionp
Negative 57 pI want to create a special class of Command Ive called it DropDownRelayCommand, which are to be used on a dropdown button which has a content which consists of buttons with command.p  pThe idea is that the dropdown button should be disabled or possibly collapsed if no buttons in its content are enabled.

Negative 57 pstrongREWRITTEN QUESTIONstrongp  pI have an ASP.NET MVC 4 site that uses forms auth.  It also needs to retrieve custom user object from a service call and then set it to the HttpCurrent.User.Context.p  pthis works fine but I realised that when it hits the post authenticate request that it will hit it several times per request  not good. p  pGlobal.asax.csp  precode protected void ApplicationPostAuthenticateRequestobject sender, EventArgs e                      if User.Identity.IsAuthenticated                             IIdentity ui  HttpContext.Current.User.Identity                MyMembershipUser myUser  new MyMembershipUser ui.Name                MyCustomPrincipal myPrincipal  new MyCustomPrincipal ui, myUser                HttpContext.Current.User  myPrincipal                       codepre  pI cant entirely cache the user for a number of reasons so lets not go there.p  pso this gets executed a few times per request. This means for every hit, it calls the DB. p  pSome views on the site use the custom principal to display some user specific details only if they are authenticated. if they arent, then it wont display it. But if they are authenticated, it gets the principal and casts it to MyCustomPrincipal so I can grab the properties I need to display.p  pHow can I prevent these multiple hits p  pI tried creating a custom Authorize attribute and doing the above code in there, it works but fails when it renders the view which can see the user is authenticated but fails to do the cast because at that point, the User Identityprincipal is still set to the Generic principal.p  ptypical code in the viewp  precodeif Helpers.UserContext.IsAuthenticated      tmpStatus  Helpers.UserContext.User.Status  codepre  pUserContext.IsAuthenticated just returns HttpContext.Current.User.Identity.IsAuthenticatedp  pUser in UserContext does the castingp  precodereturn HttpContext.Current.User as MyCustomPrincipal codepre  pI hope this clarifies the question morep  pI want to avoid multiple hits happening on the PostAuthenticateRequest but not sure why those hits are happening. I am not even sure if it is the right place to place it. I want to make sure that the Context User is all setup for subsequent accessesrequests to it without having to call the service layer to get the details again.p  pthanksp

Negative 57 pIm plotting multiple hysteresis loops from multiple files in the same axis using a for loop, and Im wondering how to have a different label and colour for each loop.

Unfortunately though, all the lines are the same colour.  I would like to have each curve up and down from file to have a different colour and a different label but Im at a loss as to how to do it.p

Negative 57 pIn a WinForms application I run several BackgroundWorkers to send bulk email. No, its not spam, its corporate email.p  pFrom time to time, a strongSmtpException Failure sending mailstrong happens when sending the email. This SmtpException is thrown inside a trycatch and written in a log. However, when this exception in particular happens, it takes about 5 minutes to write the exception to the log and continue, after which every email fails with the same exception and it takes about 5 minutes for it to handle each failed email.p  pFrom my research Ive read that a BackgroundWorker stops when an unhandled exception is thrown in debug mode. However, Ive ran the project with debug and release configurations, and the behavior is the same. strongEven when in debug mode, the BackgroundWorker stops for a long time without the debugger popping up any exception message.strongp  pAlso note that this bug is difficult to reproduce, as the first SmtpException with message Failure sending mail is thrown when it has sent between 300800 emails, at seemingly random points.p  pFor logging Im just using Trace from System.Diagnostics, so I dont think thats the problem.p  pEDIT I should also add that in some rare occasions, when SmtpException with message Failure sending mail, the BackgroundWorker stops going through the emails completely.

Negative 57 pIve been trying to figure out AVCapture the last couple of days and am struggling to save a video. My understanding is that you call code[movieFileOutput startRecordingToOutputFileURLoutputURL recordingDelegateself]code and then at a later time you can call code[movieFileOutput stopRecording]code And it should then call the delegate method codevoidcaptureOutputAVCaptureFileOutput captureOutput didFinishRecordingToOutputFileAtURLNSURL outputFileURL fromConnectionsNSArray connections errorNSError errorcode.

Negative 57 pThis is a followup of an a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18861514usingandoverloadingatemplatememberfunctionofabaseclassearlier questiona of mine. In that question, it became evident that a class cannot overload a template member function of a base class. GCC accepts it but Clang does not, correctly, due to some obscure rule in the language.p  pAt that time, it appeared that overloading fails only for explicitly specified template arguments. However, I now find it fails also for automatic deduction, which is much more commonp  precodeinclude lttypetraitsgt  struct X      template lttypename Agt     void operatorAampamp const     struct Y  X      using Xoperator      template lttypename Agt     typename stdenableif ltstdisclass ltAgtgttype     operatorAampamp const     int main       Y0  codepre  pIn this case, GCC compiles fine apparently calling codeXoperatorcode, but Clang only sees codeYcodes codeoperatorcode which is disabled for codeA  intcode. I was almost sure this should be working but I cannot find any examples now in my code.p  pIn the previous question, one workaround the only one I know of was to bring all overloads in the same base class. This is really a mess, so any other workaround will be appreciated.p  pstrongEDITstrong Some people have found it unclear what the question was. To clarify bringing all overloads in the same class is not only a mess. Its not really a solution because it breaks the entire concept of inheritance. The question is then stronghow can I overload a member function template with another of a base classstrongp

Negative 57 pI am porting an iOS 6 application to iOS 7 and have noticed some UI bugs that I have bad some issues solving.  The largest would be one I found in the UITextView.  In iOS 6 I have a UITextField that has a varying amount of dynamic text in it.  I have a function that resizes the table view cell around the text view but I found it hard to accurately predict the size of the UITextView so I just disabled clipping and let the text overflow outside the UITextView.  I put a buffer between the cell view and the text and thought the problem was solved.  When I ported the application to iOS 7 this no longer worked.  I cant seem to find a way to have the UITextView not clip its subviews and overflow the text as it did in iOS 6.  I have tried setting codesetClipsToBoundsNOcode both in the UIStoryboard and programatically, and have also tried disabling the layer mask with codesetMasksToBoundsNOcode.  Nothing seems to work, how can I solve this problemp

Negative 57 pI am making a small ANSI C application that uses pointers to sort int values using the bubble sort algorithm.p  pMy main filep  precodeinclude bubbleSort.h  char Ar[]  All Gaul is divided into three parts, one of which the Belgae inhabit, the Aquitani another, those who in their own language are called Celts, in our Gauls, the third. All these differ from each other in language, customs and laws. The river Garonne separates the Gauls from the Aquitani the Marne and the Seine separate them from the Belgae. Of all these, the Belgae are the bravest, because they are furthest from the civilization and refinement of [our] Province, and merchants least frequently resort to them, and import those things which tend to effeminate the mind and they are the nearest to the Germans, who dwell beyond the Rhine , with whom they are continually waging war for which reason the Helvetii also surpass the rest of the Gauls in valor, as they contend with the Germans in almost daily battles, when they either repel them from their own territories, or themselves wage war on their frontiers. One part of these, which it has been said that the Gauls occupy, takes its beginning at the river Rhone  it is bounded by the river Garonne, the ocean, and the territories of the Belgae it borders, too, on the side of the Sequani and the Helvetii, upon the river Rhine , and stretches toward the north.

Negative 57 pI have about 20,000 documents stored in elastic search, at about 200kb each.p  pI have a search which has 733 hits total, Im running that takes about 50ms to complete when returning 10 results.p  pIf I set the size to 1000 so that it returns all results, the search takes 35 seconds to return.p  pNormally I would see that this is because it has to continue searching until it finds all of them, which takes extra time. However when returning 10 results only, the search still says 733 hits in total, so it already knows which documents are to be returnedp  pNote that I am not returning the source field here, all I want it the list of ids back, so I cant imagine that it would have to read any more data from the disk, as all the ids are surely stored in the indices anyway.p  pAm I missing something in the way this worksp  pMy ids are guids that we use internally.p  pEDIT Since posting Ive reindexed with two changes to the mappingp  ul liSet source to false, so now the actual documents arent stored.li liChanged the index for the field that I was searching on to be notanalyzed.li ul  pThis solves the problem, now Im getting all 733 ids back in 50ms.

Negative 57 pI have single activity which in onCreate method I create viewPager, then I provide to it my CustomAdapterwhich inherits from FragmentStatePagerAdapter with data and call on viewPager setCurrentItem. In onPageSelected method,  I return fragment instance from adapter and then I call  particular method which render the screen. And here is the problem, it works perfectly on first time when I execute activity, but when I leave that activity and get back to it crash happen. Any tips why is this happening  it seems like on second time adapter just doesnt notice that it is filled with fresh data.  I try to force adapter to  reload calling adapter.notifyDataSetChanged in onCreate method but it doesns solve the issue. p  pHere is the code, I hope it gives some light on problem.p  precodepublic

Negative 57 pI need to build a query in Rails that returns people that have a certain set of attributes. I simplfied my example.

But I have my problems with example 1. I dont know how to handle the codeANDcode here. And not to forget The codeWHEREcode statements are dynamic. Means there can be heaps of them, or just one.p  pBasically I am looking for the right SQL statement to do this. I already played around a little bit and the best thing I got until now was thisp  precodeSELECT people.  FROM people  INNER JOIN attributes ON attributes.personid  people.id  WHERE   attributes.name  gender AND attributes.value  male OR    attributes.name  age AND attributes.value gt 25  GROUP BY people.id  HAVING count  2 codepre  pI dont like this solution because I have to specify the number of matches in the codeHAVINGcode clause. There must be a more elegant and flexible solution to do this.p  pHere is a more complex example that doesnt workp  precodeSELECT people.  FROM people  INNER JOIN attributes ON attributes.personid  people.id  WHERE   attributes.name  gender AND attributes.value  male OR    attributes.name  age AND attributes.value gt 25 AND   attributes.name  bodysize AND attributes.value gt 180 GROUP BY people.id codepre  pAny ideas and help will be appreciated.

Negative 57 pSo I have found plenty of examples across SO that show how to assign the result of dynamic SQL to variables but I have yet to find one that does it the way that I am trying to... So either I am going about this the wrong way or I just havent found the proper syntax to perform this correctly.p  pBasically, I am trying to create an XML record of a row from a table before deleting the row from the table think of it as an audit of the table using a Stored Procedure.  I was attempting to do this through dynamic SQL so that the Stored Procedure can be called from multiple other Stored Procedures that perform Delete operations on their corresponding tables, but before doing so they pass the necessary information the sql variable which will contain the select statement to obtain the record to this Audit Stored Procedure.p  precodeCreate Procedure dbo.AuditDelete sql NVARCHAR200, TableName VARCHAR50, UserName NVARCHAR256  AS   DECLARE XML XML BEGIN   at this point sql will contain a select statement written by the calling stored procedure   which is specifically written to return the record that is being deleted, example sql  select  from my.table where tableId  1 FOR XML AUTO    execute spexecutesql sql, NXML XML OUTPUT, XML  XML OUTPUT   SELECT XML                I was doing this as a check to ensure that XML has the record               because the execute command returned the XML record, but XML is null...               and I cant figure out why    code for inserting into the Audit table codepre  pSo Im sure that its either some syntax Im missing or perhaps Im just going about this the wrong way.  Any suggestionsp  pNote this is being done in SSMS on SQL Server 2008 R2p

Negative 57 pCan someone give the implementation of coderemoveObject objcode method is List in javapHow and where is this overloaded method defined and what is the implementation in codeArrayListcodepThe second part of the question is between an codeArrayListcode and codeLinkedListcode the coderemoveint indexcode method will work faster in codeArrayListcode because of the underlying implementationone is array and other linkedlist. But what about removeobject obj method Which one will be faster Because according to my understanding both will take same time. In codeArrayListcode the iteration will be on contiguous memory locations whereas for codeLinkedListcode it wont be. But we have to basically iterate over each element and check using equals which object needs to be fetched.p  pEDITp  pI just thought I will give some background why I am asking this question. Often we are asked for frequent insertion and deletion which List is best to use. And I am very much confused regarding this. If we use the coderemoveint indexcode method codeArrayListcode can jump to the locationmove the underlying pointer and delete the object and then shift the elements whereas for codeLinkedListcode it needs to traverse from the headNode to the index and change the nextNode to point to the later value. Which will be faster and why What happens when we start using the coderemoveObject ocode methodSome information a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions322715whentouselinkedlistoverarraylistWhen to use LinkedListltgt over ArrayListltgtap

Negative 57 pIm studying a code snippet I grabbed from strongEffective ObjectiveCstrong book by strongMatt Gallowaystrong. The snippet is the following Ive modified a little bit.p  precode voiddownloadData      NSURL url   allocinit     NetworkFetcher networkFetcher          [[NetworkFetcher alloc] initWithURLurl]     [networkFetcher startWithCompletionHandlerNSData data         NSLogRequest URL  finished, networkFetcher.url         fetchedData  data     ]      ARC will put a release call for the networkFetcher here  codepre  pAs stated by the author, such pattern is used by different networking libraries and there is a retain cycle. The retain cycle is quite obvious for me since, if you think in terms of object graph, the codenetworkFetchercode instance retains the block through a codecompletionHandlercode property codecopycodeied, while the block retains the codenetworkFetchercode since it uses it in codeNSLogcode.p  pNow, to break the block, the codeNetworkFetchercode must set the completion handler to codenilcode when it  finishes to download the data has been requested.p  precode in NetworkFetcher.m class  voidrequestCompleted       ifself.completionHandler           invoke the block         self.completionHandler           self.completionHandler  nil  codepre  pOk. In this way there is no retain cycle anymore. The block, when run, it frees its reference to the codenetworkFetchercode and the codenetworkFetchercode makes codenilcode the reference to the block.p  pNow, my question regards the execution flow of the snippet. Is the following sequence of actions correctp  ol lithe codenetworkFetchercode runs the completion handlerli lithe block is executedli lithe block frees the reference to the codenetworkFetchercodeli lithe codenetworkFetchercode release the reference to the blockli ol  pMy doubt relies on actions 3 and 4 . If 3 is executed before 4 no one has a reference to codenetworkFetchercode and so it can be released at any execution time ARC will put a release call at the end of codedownloadDatacode. Am I wrong or am I missing somethingp  pHope the question its clear.p

Negative 57 pI have a specific case in C where I would like to avoid having the same code repeated all over a set of classes that derive from another set of classes where I can not paste this code into.

Negative 57 p[EDIT For now, Ive ended up handrolling my own solution with swing timers, which seems to be working OK for my needs.

Negative 57 pAs far as I can read, Android may kill my process at any time a hrefhttpandroiddevelopers.blogspot.dk201004multitaskingandroidway.html relnofollow1a.p  pOne might interpret the article [1] such that, at any point, a process must be able to survive a crash. How is that handled Are there any guarantees of any methods being called if a process is killed this way The article doesnt mention it.p  pMy question is, how do you guarantee that a forcekilled process resumes in some sane way on next start The only state my process has assuming no guarantees are made for methods being called when process is killed is the state in persistent storage a DB or elsewhere and this is likely to be incomplete if process is forcekilled.p  pConcrete example Lets say I ask a Service to perform some work. This work is not something like playing a music file. It is work that can be considered done at some point e.g. sending data to the web. If my Service gets killed, say after 50 of the work is done, how would my app know if the work was successful I could have a flag in persistent storage saying done, but even then, Android might kill my Service after I send the last byte and before I set the flag.p  pIs there any common way of handling this My Service could, when restarted, negotiate with the web server to see if the file was transferred, but it quickly gets really complicated and I dont think it would really solve the problem.p  p[Edit 1 start]p  pI am aware of the following text [1] but that does not solve the problem for services, This last state is generated each time the user leaves that part of the application, not when it is killedp  p[Edit 1 end]p  p[Edit 2 start]p  pI found something really interesting.

Maybe its because Im using NSURLSession to load a PDF from a server and then display it.p  pRight now it looks like this img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMmvZf.png altenter image description herep  pMy first guess was that it doesnt work because the NSURLSession delegates are not on the main thread but even if I remove the subviews that contain the shadow on the main thread and call codesetNeedsDisplaycode it doesnt change.p  pIm starting a codeDownloadTaskcode and when the task is finished and the delegate gets called I remove the layers.p  precode  voidURLSessionNSURLSession session       downloadTaskNSURLSessionDownloadTask downloadTask didFinishDownloadingToURLNSURL location       NSData data  [NSData dataWithContentsOfURLlocation]     [self.webView loadDatadata MIMETypeapplicationpdf textEncodingNameutf8 baseURLnil]        remove shadow layers from scrollview     dispatchasyncdispatchgetmainqueue,          self.webView.scalesPageToFit  YES          for UIView subView in [self.webView subviews]                      if [subView isKindOfClass[UIScrollView class]]                  for UIView shadowView in [subView subviews]                                      if [shadowView isKindOfClass[UIImageView class]]                          [shadowView setHiddenYES]                                                                      [self.webView.layer setNeedsDisplay]       codepre  pEven if a remove the GCD async block and its executed in the same thread it doesnt change anything.

I reviewed a few possibilities, a hrefhttpblogs.office.com20120803automaticallyrelinkmicrosoftaccesstables relnofollow titlehereherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16416747relinkingdatabasetablesaccessvba titlehereherea, but they dont apply to my specific scenario, below.p  ul liThe two files always exist in the same user directory. li liThese are the only two Access files in each directory. li liThe directories are located on the users local C drives in a Dropbox folder.li liThe names of the two files change slightly with each versionbuild update. ul liExample frontend name DigExams0.10.f005.u101.accdbli liExample backend name DigExamsbackend0.10.b001.u101.accdbli liNaming convention Filenamemajor.minor.build.user.accdbli li[  The back end file also includes the word backend. ]li ulli ul  pI was thinking that some code could be embedded into a button on the front end that would OnClick run the Linked Table Manager, look for the only other Access file in the directory or the file with backend in the name, and then link all of the tables to it. If there was a conflict, such as a third Access file in the directory, an error would appear.p  pAdvice Suggestions Thanksp

Negative 57 pSuppose you do not have control over object creation and disposal. There are some circumstances where you dont.p  pTake the instance of MVC. Suppose you had something like thisp  precodeinterface IFoo  IDisposable    class HomeController      private IFoo foo  null      HomeControllerIFoo foo              foo  foo           ActionResult Index              return Viewfoo       codepre  pOnce your object is passed to the View, you pretty much lose control over it.p  pIn this case, I can only think of two ways to mitigate this scenariop  p1 If it hurts, dont do it. In other words, dont let what you give to your views be codeIDisposablecodes.p  p2 Or, same as 1 but if you do receive an codeIDisposablecode and you want to pass it to the view, dont pass the codeIDisposablecode as such. Cast, even if it involves a copy of all data, to something thats not codeIDisposablecode and call the codeDisposecode yourself. For e.g. like sop  precodeActionResult Index      usingfoo            return ViewFooViewModelfoo       codepre  pBut I am curious. Does MVC check for codeIDisposablecode and call it on any state received by the View once it is done rendering the Viewp

Negative 57 pI am maintaining an old PHP application and I would like to configure it to use a hrefhttpwww.mandrill.com relnofollowMandrilla for outgoing email. Mandrill, of course, requires SMTP authentication. The application uses PHPs codemailcode function directly.p  pIs there any way I can configure sendmail or an equivalent service to send using SMTP authentication by default with the credentials for Mandrill, without having to replace all the codemailcode calls throughout the applicationp  pI saw some other answers about SMTP configuration in php.ini but that only works on Windows, so I believe the only PHP setting I could change that would potentially be useful is codesendmailpathcode, which defaults to codesendmail t icode. I was thinking maybe I could point it to a shell script instead but Im not sure how to go about that or whether it would work.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThanks to mti2935s answer, I was able to get this working. I had trouble getting sSMTP to work got the error sendmail Cannot open smtp.mandrillapp.com587 even though there was no firewall blocking it so I followed the second link and set up MSMTP. I had to change the codetlstrustfilecode setting to etcpkitlscertscabundle.crt note Im running CentOS 6. Also, the codesendmailpathcode PHP setting recommended in the link didnt work for me I had to change it to usrbinmsmtp C etcmsmtpmyconfig t and restart Apache since I changed this in php.ini rather than in an .htaccess file...note that the config file can be called whatever you want choose your own name in place of myconfig.p
Negative 57 pIm relatively inexperienced with Openlayers, and Ive been trying to figure this out for a while now. Basically Ive created a layer on my map from a WMS Call.

It adds this at the beginning of my page before it successfully renders the rest from slim into htmlp  p Angular Rails Template  source appassetstemplatesbooksindexx.html.slim angular.moduletemplates.run[templateCache, functiontemplateCache  templateCache.putbooksindexx.html, p  pstrongthe rest of my webpage, beautifully rendered from slim to htmlstrongp  p ] p  pSo its close, but no cigar.  Ive seen other work arounds for this, involving going into your config folder in rails and adding files and so on... but none of them seemed to work.  Any direction I should be looking here  My main goal is just be able to use templates in AngularJS mainly so I can use the ui router but be able to write them in SLIM instead of html.p  pEDIT  Hmm... just restarted my server and now everything works. Whats really scary is that everything works without the angular rails templates gem... and also without any special config file in configinitializersangularhelper.rb that looks like  For Slim, remember also to add gem to Gemfile Rails.application.assets.registerengine.slim, SlimTemplate All I had to do was call the filename.html.slim in my uirouter...and everything works.

I realize that a method of doing this would be to get the image from animationArray using timing ratios played time  total duration time, but I cant capture the begin time.  Ive tried capturing the begin time, using CACurrentMediaTime, before and after the call to addAnimationforKey and also after animation did start, but its innaccurate especially when I have a large array of images.  With a larger array of images, the beforeAdd and afterAdd times are at least a second off.  Also, afterStart is anywhere between .04 and .08 seconds off independent of the size of my images array.p  pIn the worst case scenario, I could use the afterStart begin time. However, if Im trying to animate 100 images in 1 second, getting the image using this method would be inaccurate by 4 frames.  Therefore, I either need a method that doesnt use timing in order to get the current frame of the animation, or I need a way to get a more accurate begin time.  Is this possible    p  pNOTE  I dont want to use UIImageView animation to do this because that animation technique doesnt have smooth transitioning between frames.  If there were a way to have smooth transitioning between frames using UIImageView animation I would reconsider, although Im pretty sure there will still be an issue when calculating the begin time.p

Negative 57 pI installed the ownCloud 7 app Git URL a hrefhttpsgithub.comopenshiftowncloudopenshiftquickstart.git relnofollowhttpsgithub.comopenshiftowncloudopenshiftquickstart.gita via we OpenShift Online webconsole and it is running fine. I even managed to get the URLforwarding working so that users can get to this cloudified app with a familiar URL. Only after successful redirect the browsers reverts back to .rhcloud.com URL, but thats just a minotr annoyance p  pThe problem is that after using ownCloud 7 for awhile, I realized that the Openshift installation does not support .odf creation or the collaborative editing of them in server. Normally .ODF files are in ownCloud handled with LibreOffice or OpenOffice, and either of those binaries need to be accessable by ownCloud. In Openshift both of these are sadly missing resulting in inability to work with .odfdocuments.p  pNow, is it possible to get support for ODFdocument creation and collaborative writing by 1 waiting for future update of OPenshift  OwnCloud 7 quickstart image, or 2 installing libreopenoffice directly to ownCloud application space, and modifying the owncloudconfig.php accordingly i.e. adding the path to installed binary in previewlibreofficepath variablep  pThe community that is going to use our cloudified ownCloud app really needs this collaborative document writing enabled, and ODFformat would be perfect for us.   p  pCheers..p
Negative 57 pThe code asks the user whether heshe has eaten something or not. Then it loops the question until a valid input such as nothing or something is entered. My problem is that when I use the  operator, the loop continues no matter what is inputted. To my understanding, the loop should end when the user inputted string is equal to nothing, something, or both based on the operator Im using. But this result only occurs when I use the ampamp operator, which confuses me as that would mean that the user would have to input a string value equal to nothing AND something.

Negative 57 pI have a virtualenv running python 2.7.7. It has a pretty extensive set of libraries which support a pretty complicated set of proprietary modules. In other words, the virtualenv needs to maintain its integrity. That is of course the whole point of virtualenv.p  pRecently, I encountered a number of problems that are very easily solved by using Anaconda. I tried it out in a test environment and it worked quite well. Now Im tasked with incorporating this new configuration into production. It isnt clear to me how to incorporate Anaconda into a virtualenv, or whether this is even a good idea. In fact, it almost seems to me like I should use the anaconda install as the new source and desconstruct the old virtualenv... merging the libraries it held into the conda. p  pDoes anyone have a recommendation as to the best approach If merging the environments is called for, can anyone point to an explanation of how to go about it p

Negative 57 pIve come across a commond pattern where I have an codeIteratorcode whose fields Id like to initialize in the first call to the codeIteratorcodes codenextcode method. The solution Ive always come up with is to make that field an codeOptioncode, and check codeisnonecode on every call to codenextcode, initializing the field if it is codeNonecode.p  pFor example, say I wanted to create an codeIteratorcode called codeMultFirstcode which took another iterator, and multiplied the first element to all the other elements. I dont want to just get the first element when my codeMultFirstcode struct is initialized, because getting the first element could be expensive and that should be done when we start iterating through the codeMultFirstcode struct. So, I use the codeOptioncode solutionp  precodestruct MultFirstltA, I IteratorltAgtgt      firstelement A,     iterator I,   implltA MulltA,Agt, I IteratorltAgtgt IteratorltAgt for MultFirstltA,Igt      fn nextampmut self gt OptionltAgt           if self.firstelement.isnone              self.firstelement  self.iterator.next                   match self.iterator.next              Somex gt Someself.first.unwrap  x,             None gt None                codepre  pThis works just fine, but I would like to avoid checking codeisnonecode each call to codenextcode for performance. Is there some way I could accomplish this I was thinking maybe after the first call to codenextcode, I could just call codemapcode and somehow let the codeMapcode struct take over for all subsequent calls to codenextcode. But Im not sure if I can even do that. Is this possible, or is there another way I could accomplish this initialization without checking codeisnonecode every timep

Negative 57 pIve been developing an application for the Surface 3, yet during development I did not have a device to test on. Recently got one and am having some issues with the click handling.p  pBasically when doing a single click it seems as though the X position granted I dont have a way to debug and see the exact value is offset vs where I actually touch on the screen.p  pIm checking when the touch positioning when the mouse is released simply by flipping a bool when it is down, and checking the bool when the mouse is not down.p  pIt works completely fine on my PC, and it works completely fine on the Surface 3 when double clicking. But only when double clicking.p  pUsing the following to track mouse inputp  blockquote   pLPDIRECTINPUTDEVICE8  for the mousep      pMouseState a custom structure to handle all the mouse data   Long lAxisX Long lAxisY BYTE buttons[4] p blockquote  pIm guessing there is a difference in how windows 8.1 on the surface handles mouse input vs touch screen input. When I connect a mouse to the device, or double click rather than single click it works flawlessly.p  pIm having a hard time finding information on this, most searches with input for the Surface 3 or windows 8.1 have to do with using XAML and have little to no examples of that in C.p  pemeditem I rendered a sprite where the location of the input is showing at all times. It is being rendered in the correct location the entire time. Still a single click on any of the buttons does nothing when using the touch screen rather than a mouse. As mentioned before a double click does work.p
Negative 57 pIve read about factorization of integers into the prime factors and did a proof of concept implementation of Pollards rho algorithmp  pa hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiPollard27srhoalgorithm relnofollowhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiPollard27srhoalgorithmap  pThe algorithm is easy to implement, works so far. However it may and does fail for certain numbers. The Wikipedia page suggest to restart the algorithm using a different start condition or pick a random generator function.p  pThat does not sound very deterministic to me. Is there an approach that guarantees that the algorithm will eventually terminatep  pI know that the state of the art is the elliptic curve integer factorization, and I plan to implement it for laughs and giggles later. To do so I first need a prime factorization algorithm for small numbers though, that is why I have to deal with something like Pollards rho algorithm first.p

Negative 57 pI am a PhD student and have been working with Clang with the aim to do an intraprocedural dataflow analysis. Particularly, I have been trying to use the Libtooling Clang interface based on a hrefhttpclang.llvm.orgdocsRAVFrontendAction.html relnofollowthisa tutorial and the existing LiveVariables analysis.

Specifically, I have overridden VisitFunctionDecl so as to calculate a LiveVariables analysis on every function. When I dump the live values, it shows correctly all the blocks in my function but it doesnt show any of the live variables. I tried using clang cc1 analyze analyzercheckerdebug.DumpLiveVars test.c which works as expected, displaying all the variables live in different blocks.p  pHere is my code for VisitFunctionDecl.

I dont know how to instantiate them for each row...p  pHere is the jsfiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net3nv6hm7k relnofollowJSFIDDLEap  pSome codep  precodevar methods        init function options           var state                timer null,              timerSeconds 60,              callback function  ,              timerCurrent 0,              showPercentage false,              fill false,              color CCC                     state  .extendstate, options           return this.eachfunction                var this  this              var data  this.datapietimer              if data                   this.addClasspietimer                  this.css                      fontSize this.width                                    this.datapietimer, state                  if state.showPercentage                       this.find.percent.show                                    if state.fill                       this.addClassfill                                    this.pietimerstart                              ,       stopWatch function             var data  this.datapietimer          if data               var seconds  data.timerFinish  new Date.getTime  1000              if seconds lt 0                   clearIntervaldata.timer                  this.pietimerdrawTimer, 100                  data.callback               else                   var percent  100  seconds  data.timerSeconds  100                  this.pietimerdrawTimer, percent                              ,       drawTimer function percent            this  this          var data  this.datapietimer          if data               this.htmlltdiv classpercentgtltdivgtltdiv classslice  percent gt 50   gt50    gtltdiv classpiegtltdivgt  percent gt 50  ltdiv classpie fillgtltdivgt    ltdivgt              var deg  360  100  percent              this.find.slice .pie.css                  moztransform rotate  deg  deg,                      webkittransform rotate  deg  deg,                      otransform rotate  deg  deg,                      transform rotate  deg  deg                            var secs  data.timerSeconds  100  percent  100 NEW              this.find.percent.htmlMath.roundsecs   Changed              if data.showPercentage                   this.find.percent.show                            if this.hasClassfill                   this.find.slice .pie.css                      backgroundColor data.color                                 else                   this.find.slice .pie.css                      borderColor data.color                                                ,       start function             var data  this.datapietimer          if data               data.timerFinish  new Date.getTime  data.timerSeconds  1000              this.pietimerdrawTimer, 0              data.timer  setIntervalthis.pietimerstopWatch, 50                ,       reset function            console.logflag 4          var data  this.datapietimer          if data               clearIntervaldata.timer              this.pietimerdrawTimer, 0                     .fn.pietimer  function method        if methods[method]           return methods[method].applythis, Array.prototype.slice.callarguments, 1       else if typeof method  object  method           return methods.init.applythis, arguments       else           .errorMethod   method   does not exist on jQuery.pietimer             function runTimer        .timer.pietimer          timerSeconds 60,          color ccc,          fill ccc,          showPercentage true,          callback function                console.logflag 7               alertyahoo, timer is done              .timer.pietimerreset              this.find.percent.html0                   codepre  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 57 pI have a codeModelAcode implements codeIDataErrorInfocode with the validation rule defined inside the codeModelAcode. My codeViewModelAcode contains a codeListAcode of type codeObservableCollectionltModelAgtcode, and is data bound to my codeViewAcode for user interaction with the list add, delete, edit, etc..p  pNow I want a codeViewModelBcode which will inherent from codeViewModelAcode, and data bound to the same view codeViewAcode, but I want the codeModelAcode in codeListAcode use different validation rule. p  pI think I can achieve it byp  ul lipA create a new codeModelBcode derived from codeModelAcode and override the Validation functions there create a new codeListBcode of type codeObservableCollectionltModelBgtcode in my codeViewModelBcode.  But I cant find a way to reuse the codeViewAcode with this new list and I need to create a new codeViewBcode to display it.pli lipB use a global flag to indicate the ViewModel, and change the validation rule according to that flag. This way I can use the same  codeViewAcode to link with the same codeListAcode in my codeViewModelBcode.pli ul  pBut I was really looking for something like p  ul licreate a new codeModelBcode derived from codeModelAcode and override the Validation functions there somehow redefine my codeListAcode to codeObservableCollectionltModelBgtcode in codeViewModelBcode and then reuse codeViewAcode.li ul  pIs there any way of doing thisp

When the tag is first included with the optional attribute set, it has the expected value.

Negative 57 pI am trying to implement a twodrawer layout with the android v7 support library. I have a navigation drawer on the left Gravity.START side and a notification drawer on the right Gravity.END side. The problem is that I need the hamburger in the action bar to stay a hamburger when the notification drawer is pulled out, but stay animated and change to an arrow if the navigation drawer is pulled out. Currently it changes to an arrow when either one is pulled out. I have successfully disabled the animation by overriding codeonDrawerSlideView, floatcode and only calling to codesuper.onDrawerSlideView, floatcode if the View is the navigation drawer and doing nothing if the View is the notification drawer like thisp  precodeOverride public void onDrawerSlideView drawerView, float slideOffset       Make sure it was the navigation drawer     ifdrawerView.equalsnavigationDrawer          super.onDrawerSlidedrawerView, slideOffset          else           Do nothing       codepre  pHowever, once the notification drawer has fully opened, the icon still changes to an arrow.

If it helps the inherent codedatecode codedatecode type and codeidcode codeserialcode obviously rows only ever increase, so there is no chance that the codedatecode rows will ever change from their initial value.p  pSo visually based off of the table above I need the query to return the following...p  precode  id  idpart  idfinish  idmetal  iddescription  date        sort    37  2997     1          12        3               20150108  1       36  2990     1          22        3               20150107  2      codepre
Negative 57 pI am working on doing something like the google chat plugin for chrome, but after working on it for awhile, I realized I might not have the right structure.p  pI am using MongoDb and have the following model. I am basically trying to make it work like this guide a hrefhttpjosephndungu.comtutorialsgmaillikechatapplicationinrubyonrails relnofollowhttpjosephndungu.comtutorialsgmaillikechatapplicationinrubyonrailsa, but use firebase instead of Faye, and Mongo instead of SQL.p  pI dont know if its best to keep the conversations on the Mongo side, and just have the messages in Firebase. Could that work with unread message notifications, new conversations, and  new messages. p  pIs it best to have the Conversation structure also in Firebase If so, how would that work linking Users in our Mongo Tablep

Negative 57 pOur backend does server side receipt verification. In order to check the last expiration date for a renewable subscription, we look at the information in stronglatestreceiptinfostrong. This approach works most of the times.p  pHowever, we have some cases of users that, even with active subscriptions, stronglatestreceiptinfostrong only contains the initial subscription, which has already expired. I wonder if someone has already experienced this issue of having missing transactions. It looks extremely weird to me, because Apple is not returning the emright informationem. These users were charged properly, but the Apple response does not reflect that. Am I missing something Documentation is far from being great... Thanksp

Negative 57 pI have searched the internet a lot for an answer to my question and have not found exactly what I was looking for. So the standard way, from what I have seen, to accomplish this is to use jQuerys submit and AJAX to send the data and redirect to another PHP page. However, I have multiple problems with this. First of all, AJAX. Regular AJAX does not work on Wordpress sites, from what I have seen. How do I get plain old regular AJAX to work I have not seen a single good tutorial for this that is in plain English for Dummies. Second of all, the PHP redirect. I just want it to send to PHP already on the page. I just want data to go from my Javascript into my PHP already on the page. I dont need a redirect. So, my final question is, can those two problems be fixed in order to do it the traditional way Or is there a better way to do it that circumvents these problems I am a complete beginner, BTW been doing web programming for less than five months. So please, for Dummies or Complete Idiots language if you can.

Negative 57 pI have a repository class which uses a query that is constructed in C by concatenating strings based on certain conditions. I want to move this query from C code to stored procedures. Now a piece of code does an inner join with a huge user table  I am talking about millions of records based on a condition. Here is the snippet.p  precode    StringBuilder sb  new StringBuilder     sb.AppendLine  SELECT     sb.AppendLine  I.[Code] AS ItemCode, IP.[PlatformCode]     sb.AppendLine  FROM [product].[ProductPlatform] PP     sb.AppendLine  JOIN [product].[Product] P ON PP.[ProductId]  P.[Id]     if condition              sb.AppendLine    JOIN [user].[UserItem] UI ON I.[ItemCode]  UI.[ItemCode] AND IP.[PlatformCode]  UI.[PlatformCode] AND UI.[UserId]  UserId          if condition2              sb.AppendLine    JOIN [user].[UserProductItem] UPI ON I.[Code]  UPI.[ProductItemCode] AND UPI.[UserId]  UserId          ... codepre  pThere are other joins but they are not important. Now the two join strings will be totally ignored if the two conditions are false. Now I want to move the entire SQL code into Stored Proc without compromising performance. I dont want the two joins be executed if the conditions are false, because those two tables are huge. I created the following stored procedure where I pass the two C condition variables as parameters to my stored proc, but I think a it is not the same logic as if the condition is not met the query returns nothing, I guess I need a left join and b performance is not preserved as before.p  precode    JOIN [user].[UserItem] UI ON a.[ItemCode]  UI.[ItemCode] AND PP.[PlatformCode]  UI.[PlatformCode] AND UI.[UserId]  UserId AND onlyConditionMet  1       JOIN [user].[UserProduct] UP ON P.[Code]  UP.[ProductCode] AND UP.[UserId]  UserId AND onlyCondition2Met  1 codepre  pNow the question is how can I best move my code to stored proc by preserving performance and not changing the query too much.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Based on the solutions suggested by the folks here I ended up using IF blocks.

Negative 57 pI am learning Paxos algorithm a hrefhttpresearch.microsoft.comenusumpeoplelamportpubspaxossimple.pdf relnofollowhttpresearch.microsoft.comenusumpeoplelamportpubspaxossimple.pdfa and there is one point I do not understand. p  pWe know that events follow a timely order, and it happens when, say, events 15 and 10 are decided, but 69 and 11 thereafter are not yet. In the paper above, it says we simply fill in the gap between 69 with noop values, and simply record new events from 11 and on.p  pSo in this case, since event 10 is already recorded, we know some kinds of events must have happened between 5 and 10 but are not recorded by Paxos due to some failures. If we simply fill in noop values, these events will lost in our recording. p  pEven worse, if, as the paper I linked above says, events are in fact commands from the client, then missing a few commands in the middle might make the entire set of operations illegal if none of the commands can be skipped or the order of them matters. p  pSo why is it still legit for Paxos to fill noop values for gaps between events If the entire set of records might be invalid because of noop values as I concerned above. Also, is there a better way to recover from such gaps instead of using noop p

Negative 57 pIm developing a realtime game using Sprite Kit and Game Kit. The game features a multiplayer mode where 4 players can play with each other. Ive been reading the Game Kit programing guide and came across the following passagep  blockquote   pAlthough the GKMatch object creates a full peertopeer connection   between all the participants, strongyou can reduce the network traffic by   layering a ring or clientserver networking architecture on top of itstrong.   Figure 81 shows three possible network topologies for a fourplayer   game. On the left, a peertopeer game has 12 connections between the   various devices. However, you could layer a clientserver architecture   on top of this by nominating one of the devices to act as the host. If   your game transmits to or from the host only, you can halve the number   of connections. A ring architecture allows devices to forward network   packets to the next device only, but further reduces the number of   connections. Each topology provides different performance   characteristics, so you will want to test different models to find one   that provides the performance your game requires.p blockquote  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXJNyw.png altenter image description herep  pSo here is where I am confused. Currently in my game I have implemented the peertopeer topology, where each user sends their position to every other player in the game. This ends up totaling 12 messages being sent, because each player sends 3 messages.p  pHowever according to the documentation, if I layer a clientserver topology over my game, I can reduce the network traffic by reducing the number of connections. If I do this though, then each client will send their position to the host and then the host would need to relay those positions to the remaining clients. So now one player the host needs to work extra because the clients no longer communicate with each other. And then we still end up with 12 messages. The host sends 9 messages 3 messages for each player, plus 6 messages for relaying the other clients positions then each client sends 1 position message to the host. 9  1  1  1  12 messages. Which makes sense, all we did was unevenly distribute the message sending, so now one player needs to work harder to makeup for the less work the other players are doing.p  pFurthermore, relaying the client messages takes additional time because each clients position now needs to pass through the host. p  pSo while there are now less connections, one player is sending more messages 9 messages rather than each player evenly distributing the workload i.e. each player sending 3 messages. This seems like it would lead to a greater chance for disconnects to occur because it will be easier for the host to disconnect from the match. p  pSo can someone explain to me how network traffic gets reduced by layering a clientserver topology Does just the fact of having less connections in the match reduce network traffic even though overall messages are the same Keep in mind, there is no dedicated server here, I and the documentation am talking about layering a clientserver topology on top of the peertopeer match. Also isnt the host at a greater chance of disconnecting because he is sending 3X as much messages as the other players. After all, the GKMatch will disconnect a player after a brief period of packet loss. Or does simply the fact of having 12 connections have a greater chance for disconnects because of the supposedly increased traffic p

Negative 57 pIm using jasperserver 3.7.2 and ireport 3.7.2.  I am passing in the locale to jasperserver as enZA.

When I use the locale frFR the output is euro1 234,25 with the comma being used as the symbol, which is expected.

Negative 57 pFor a while now I have been implementing a RESTful API in the design of my project because in my case it is very useful for others to be able to interact with the data in a consistent format and I find REST to be a clean way of handling requests. I am now trying to not only have my current REST API for my resources, but the ability to expose some pieces of information via a bidirectional websocket connection.p  pUpon searching for a good .net library to use that implements the websocket protocol, I did find out about SignalR. There was a few problems I had with it maybe specific to my projectp  blockquote   pI want to be able to initialize a web socket connection through my   existing  REST API. I dont know the proper practice to do this, but   I figured a custom header would work fine I would like them the   client to be able to  close the connection and get a http response   back 101 to signify its completion.p blockquote  pThe problem I had with SignalR wasp  ul lithat there was no clean way outside of a hub instance to get a users connection id and map it to a external controller where the rest call made affects what piece of data gets broadcasted to the specific client I dont want to use external memoryli lithe huge reliance on client side code.

Negative 57 pI encountered this weird bug in a c multithread program on linux. The multithreaded part basically executes a loop. One single iteration first loads a sift file containing some features. And then it queries these features against a tree. Since I have a lot of images, I used multiple threads to do this querying. Here is the code snippets.p  precodestruct MultiMatchParam      int threadid     float scores     double scoresd     int perm     sizet dbimagenum     stdvectorltstdstringgt queryfilenames     int startid     int numquery     int dim     VocabTree tree     FILE file    multithread will do normalization anyway void MultiMatchMultiMatchParam ampparam       Clear scores     forsizet t  param.startid t lt param.startid  param.numquery t              for sizet i  0 i lt param.dbimagenum i             param.scores[i]  0.0          DTYPE keys         int numkeys          keys  ReadKeyssfmparam.queryfilenames[t].cstr, param.dim, numkeys          int normalize  true         double mag  param.treegtMultiScoreQueryKeysnumkeys, normalize, keys, param.scores          delete [] keys       codepre  pI run this on a 8core cpu. At first it runs perfectly and the cpu usage is nearly 100 on all 8 cores. After each thread has queried several images about 20 images, all of a sudden the performance cpu usage drops drastically, down to about 30 across all eight cores.p  pI doubt the key to this bug is concerned with this line of code. p  precodedouble mag  param.treegtMultiScoreQueryKeysnumkeys, normalize, keys, param.scores codepre  pSince if I replace it with another costly operations e.g., a large forloop containing sqrt. The cpu usage is always nearly 100. This MultiScoreQueryKeys function does a complex operation on a tree. Since all eight cores may read the same tree no write operation to this tree, I wonder whether the read operation has some kind of blocking effect. But it shouldnt have this effect because I dont have write operations in this function. Also the operations in the loop are basically the same. If it were to block the cpu usage, it would happen in the first few iterations. If you need to see the details of this function or other part of this project, please let me know.p

Negative 57 pNow I have a big problems with installing Visual Studio Community. These problems came when I get back to Windows 7 from Win10 because I had some problems.p  pWhen I launched the actuall Visual Studio first time on Win7, it loaded good, but I didnt have any templates. So I decided to reinstall it. Uninstall went good, but when I tried to install it again, strongit just stopped at emMicrosoft Visual Studio Hub Servicesem or something like that.strong It just really stopped, when I let it go, the progress bar never moved. Also it then said that it couldnt find it or something similar.p  pAnd then the fun starts. I tried to do it several times, same. Then I downloaded the Visual Studio 2013 Community, and strongit stopped on emBuild x86emstrong. Same like the Hub Services at the 2015 version. I gave up at this moment. But after I went angry and removed the all Visual Studio folders in the Program Files.p  pBut then later on, I found the emVisual Studio 2015 Express for Desktopem, I downloaded it and that time it said right at the beginning codeA Prerelease version of Visual Studio Community is currenlty installed. Please uninstall it prior to proceeding with your current installation.code I listened to it, went to emRemove and Add Programsem thing dont know what name it is in english and yeah, there was an version of that Visual Studio I removed. I tried to uinstall it, but it just said something again codeThe installation source for this product is not available. Make sure that the source exists and that you can access it.code. And thats basicly all.p  pSo I want to ask, how to fix this thing. Its because of that movement from Win10 to Win7 Or because of the VS folder deletement in Program Files Any answers are very welcomep  pEDIT Main problem is that it stops at Microsoft Visual Studio Hub Services, I managed to uninstall the 2015 Community version, but then it stops and just didnt move, strongthe only way was to remove the process to shut down the installing window and cancel the installing.strongp
