Positive 1796 pSome programs can be executed from anywhere with a single oneword command. An example of this is youtubedl, which is a python program that can be executed with the simple command codeyoutubedl [input]code. As far as I have understood, this is simply because there exists a file called codeusrbinyoutubedlcode, and codeusrbincode is in PATH. However, I do not understand what I have to do to make something like this myself. Right now, I have a python project called codetestprojectcode that includes a python program like this codetestprojectfilesmyownprogram.pycodep  pWhat do I have to do to make this a binary executable such as youtubedlp  pI know I can make an codealias moppython testprojectfilesmyownprogram.pycode, and this is also what I have done, and it works fine. That is, I can write code mopcode, and successfully run my program.  But for curiositys, and learnings, sake, I want to know how to make a file such as the codeusrbinyoutubedlcode file, removing the need for aliases.p  pI find this hard to find information about in search engines... Any help is greatly appreciated p  pstrongEditstrongp  pMy question differs from the one marked as duplicate, in that Im not looking to execute it as a .shscript. I simply want to execute it as a suffixless oneword command, similar to all the other executables that are in codeusrbincode. p  pEx. code myowncode should run my program, without the need for aliases or writing .sh or .py at the prompt. That is, I want to have a file codeusrbinmyowncode that somehow runs my codetestprojectcode at the simple command codemyowncodefrom anywhere.p

So I opened the collection editor, added in all the objects, and lo and behold, there sitting in the designer was a picture perfect view of what I wanted.p  pThis is where it starts to get ugly. For some reason or another, Designer refuses to actually generate code to create the objects and attach them to the collection, so while it looks great in Design mode, as soon as I compile and run it, it all disappears again and Im back to square one. Im at a total loss as to why this would happen if the Designer can generate it well enough to get a picture perfect view of my form with the extra behaviour, why cantwont it generate the code into the actual code filep

We currently only play a sound from the queue when the SoundAdded event is called. This is a custom event we made to be raised when we add a sound to the queue. Currently, only one sound will be played per calling of the event. We have run into the problem where after certain sounds are played, they will lock the queue, preventing further sounds from being process. We got around this by always unlocking the queue even if a sound doesnt play. However, this still leaves us with the problem of the queue getting backed up with sounds to play.p  pThe only method I can think of to solve this is to add a loop to keep trying to play the sound if there is still a sound waiting to be played. Currently, the main thread is handling sounds, I would probably need to move sound handling to a separate thread, but Im not sure what the best method of handing the sound would be.p  pSo... my question... Is there a good sound library that we can use that includes an event for the end of a sound. Or... what would be the best way to create such a thing   p

Negative 1796 pIm using the click event on the TreeView to do some stuff when a node is clicked in the TreeView.

This is a bit annoying since the node is actually selected when the image is clicked but I cant find out what node it is.p  pDo anyone have any suggestionsp  pUpdated Ive gotten some suggestions to use SelectedNode instead. I cant since its set after the Click event is fired. This actually in a control that inherits TreeView and what it does is fire its own Clicked event but with the underlying data that the TreeNode represents instead of the TreeNode itself.p  pUpdated Turns out that someone had overridden the GetNodeAt method in our code which introduced this behavior, which I didnt realize. So the question is null and void and there is no problem with the GetNodeAt method. Why someone would do this remains a mystery. p

Negative 1796 pstrongIn shortstrongp  pFor a project I need an audiovideochat for 2 people, with the ability to record part of the session. I am running into issues where the 2nd users recorded video gets messed up, with massive amounts of seemingly skipping frames andor audio loss, most likely caused by the audio stream when not recording the audio, the problem doesnt appear to occur.p  pstrongOverviewstrongp  pFor a project I need a setup where two clients can videoaudio, obviously  chat with one another. Also, the host should be able to record the session when she presses a button, and stop recording in the same way.p  pWhile this setup is far from rocket science, Ive been experiencing issues that I cant seem to figure out. The clients connect fine, and each others videos show up propely and they can even hear each other just fine. I chose to reinitialize the connection when the host starts the recording, which also works just fine. The recorded files, however, at times experience issues.p  pstrongThe possible causestrongp  pUsually the hosts recording is great, with audio and video working as it should. The client video shows problems, with the video literally jumping when played back in a number of applications such as VLC, KMPlayer, Adobes own media player, etc.. I tried to debug the situation and it seems to be directly related to the audio, though how this happens Im not sure. When I did tests with no recorded audio, both videos played back fine.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pIll try to explain what happens in the client video the video plays back normally, with audio working fine too. But in seemingly random locations of the video, playback suddenly skips seconds of the video and audio, so a one minute video sometimes lasts mere seconds even though the playback bar and the such show that the video in fact lasts for a minute. p  pI have not found any logic in how it skips some videos show only 45 gaps of a few seconds each, others jump 2030 seconds ahead, so Im assuming its a random thing.p  pstrongScenariosstrongp  pI have tested multiple scenarios, and the problem seems consistent enough as in, it occurs every time, just not when I dont record audio. I have used a local developer edition FMS server, the hosted influxis service, and I have used two local computers, one local machine using 2 webcams and 1 local, 1 really remote computer. All setups seem to have the same issues with the recorded client video.p  pstrongIn closingstrongp  pIm not sure what details you need, so please, ask me for anything you might need to help me find a solution to this. I have searched and debugged like there was no tomorrow, and havent been able to figure out what is causing this.p  pMany, emmanyem thanks in advancep  pDavep

Negative 1796 pI have been reading up on multiple PHP frameworks, especially the Zend Framework but I am getting confused about the proper way to go forward.p  pZend Framework does not use ActiveRecords but instead uses the Table Data Gateway and Row Data Gateway pattern, and uses a DataMapper to map the contents of the Row Data Gateway to the model, because ActiveRecord breaks down when your models dont have a 11 mapping to your database tables. There is an a hrefhttpframework.zend.comdocsquickstartcreateamodelanddatabasetableexample of thisa in the Zend Quickstart guide.p  pTo me, their example looks very bloated with a ton of getters and setters all over the place. I came across various blog posts about Domain Driven Design arguing that using so many getters and setters is bad practice because it exposes all the inner model data to the outside, so it has no advantage over public attributes. a hrefhttpwww.javaworld.comjavaworldjw092003jw0905toolbox.htmlHere is one examplea.p  pMy question If you remove those getters and setters, how will you render your views At some point the data has to hit the view so you can actually show something to the user. Following the DDD advice seems to break the separation between M and V in MVC. Following the MVC and Zend example seems to break DDD and leaves me typing up a whole lot of getters, setters and DataMappers for all my models. Aside from being a lot of work it also seems to violate DRY.p  pI would really appreciate some links to good examples or more information about how it all fits together. Im trying to improve my achitecture and design skills here.p

Negative 1796 pIm trying to call a Page Method using a jQuery attached event function, in which I like to use the closure to keep the event target local, as below, but page method calls declare several error functions, and I would like to use one function for all of them.  If, in the below code, I was handling an error and not success, how could I use my single, anonymous handler for all 3 error functionsp  precode        button.clickfunction               var button  this             PageMethods.DoIt                 function a, b, c                      alertbutton                           codepre  pThis example passes an anonymous function for the success callback.  There is only one of these.  If I was passing an error callback, how could I use function e, c, t for all 3 error callbacksp  pADDED  What I would like to do here is trigger an AJAX call whenever the user clicks a toggle button checkbox, but to improve responsiveness, I want to toggle the button state immediately, and only untoggle it if the AJAX call fails.p  pNow, in my clientside codeclickcode event handler, I would like to use anonymous functions inside the scope of codeclick so that the functions have access to thecodethiscodeevent argument, but I dont want to declare three functions for thecodeonTimeoutcode,codeonErrorcode, and onAbortcode arguments of the PageMethods.MyFunction function.  if I declare a named function outside of the click handler, it no longer has access to the this parameter of the codeclickcode event handler.p

Negative 1796 pI have a feature that gets installed using a WSP package, when the feature is activated, I would like the following to happenp  ol liThe feature will contain a list definition. li liWhen the feature gets activated by an end user the user physically clicks the feature activation button in site features admin  I would like a modal dialog to appear then ask the user to provide some additional details. li ol  p3.1 The additional details will be supplying a certain number of names. For example Mary, John, Peter. Form logistics I can handle. p  ol liOnce the form is complete that information needs to somehow get back to the feature reciever, so that I can then take the base list definition, and use it as a template to create  list instances for all the names supplied  so if user had supplied Mary and Peter, then 2 list instances will be created when this feature is activated. li ol  pIs any of this possible with MOSS 2007 Thank youp

Negative 1796 pIm trying to create an authorization scheme for my ASP.NET MVC application where an Enum is used to set permissions.

Id like to still use an enum bitfield since its easy to store in a DB as an int. Also its very easy to see if a permission is set.p  pDoes anyone have any idea how this could be easily accomplished using an Enum... or am I going in the completely wrong directionp  pEDIT Im really trying to avoid storing permission definitions in the DB since I really want things to be changeable without having to modify much on the DB end. Itd be really nice to know how a large scale application would do this.p

Negative 1796 pStarting from Windows Server 2003, Windows included a new tool which calculates the effective permissions for a user basically it resolves all groups access and takes care of all deny permissions as well.

Negative 1796 pHey fellows, Iam trying to build an application for realtime voicechanging. In a first step I managed to record audiodata to a specified file and to play it after recording.

Negative 1796 pI have written a simple Android application that draws a maze using a custom view derived from codeSurfaceViewcode.  It follows the model of the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comresourcessamplesLunarLanderindex.html relnofollowLunarLander sample applicationa and performs all calculation and drawing using a background thread directly into the codeSurfaceHoldercode object.p  pAll well and good and its running well for smallmedium mazes, however if I set the maze cell size to be 8 pixels there are lots of cells in the maze the application crawls along.p  pThe code is doing something I dont like in that is draws every cell even if it hasnt changed and this is required to avoid screen flickering from the codeSurfaceViewcode double buffer in previous iterations of the application I was drawing just what changed and that resulted in a jumpy mess.p  pWhat I want then is the ability to use codeSurfaceViewcode but be more selective about what gets drawn.  Is this possible  If not, what are the alternatives  How about keeping an offscreen bitmap, and selectively drawing into that firstp  pEDIT I implemented an offscreen codeBitmapcode and codeCanvascode combination, written to by my timerdriven state machine, drawing only those areas affected during carvingsolution.  I then simply draw the whole offscreen bitmap onto the codeSurfaceViewcode within the coderuncode method and this has solved my problem I am able to drop the cell size to 5 pixels and performance is fine.p

Data contains printable ASCII characters.p  pstrongChecksumstrongp  pThe Checksum is computed on all characters, including all the codeltFSgtcode characters, between codeltSTXgtcode and codeltCHKgtcode. strongThe Checksum is calculated by the 8bit binary addition of all included characters with the 8th or parity bit assumed to be zero. Carries beyond the 8th bit are lost.strong The 8bit result is converted into two printable ASCII Hex characters, ranging from 00 to FF, which are then inserted into the data stream as codeltCHKgtcode. The Hex characters AF are uppercase. The receiving device recalculates the checksum on the buffered message and compares it with the checksum it received. The comparison is the basis for subsequent acknowledgement codeltACKgtcode or negative acknowledgement codeltNAKgtcode of the transmission.p
Negative 1796 pI am having trouble getting a jquery plugin called ui multiselect to show up properly inside a modal using jqmodal.  I actually have tried another modal called simplemodal and a different multiselect plugin as well with no luck.  From what I can gather, it appears the CSS of the for uimultiselect is not being applied because the multiselect resides inside the modal div, which has display none at page load.  I have tried a number of different things suggested by others having this issue and none have worked.  Perhaps I am doing it wrong.p  pIn my code, I displayed the multiselect inside and outside of the modal.

Negative 1796 pI have a problem where I need to store changing data values vi integers for constant keys i also integers, in some range say [1M]. I need to be able to draw quickly a random element weighted by the values vi, i.e. the probability to draw key k should be vksumi1...M vip  pThe best idea I could come up with is using a binary tree and storing the partial sum over the values in the subtree rooted at k as the value for key k still in the range [1M]. Then, whenever a value changes, I need to update its node and all parent nodes in the tree takes Olog M time since the keys are fixed and thus the binary tree is perfectly balanced. Drawing a random element as above also takes Olog M time for each level of the tree, one compares the random number say in the range 0,1 against the relative weights of the left subtree, right subtree, and the node itself and is much faster than the naive algorithm take random number r, iterate through the elements to find the least k so that sumi1...k lt r, sumi1...k1  r takes OM time.p  pThe question I now have is how to optimize the placement of the tree nodes in memory in order to minimize cache misses. Since all keys are known and remain constant, this is essentially the order in which I should allocate memory for the tree nodes.p  pThanksp

Negative 1796 pI have put together an app which locates a users current position, geocodes a current address and then puts them on a map using the google maps api with a calculated route between the two.p  pIt works fine in itself  but I am finding that the first time using it on a new phone or browser, the initial prompt as to whether the user would like to share their positioning data or not is stopping it from actually resolving a position.p  pIs there a way to pause the script while that prompt is visible or any other ways I could either delay the script or detect when this has happenedp  pThanks p

Negative 1796 pIm generally of the opinion that if it aint broke dont fix it, but my current solution to this issue though it does work seems really ugly. I am using Ruby, Sinatra, Haml, and Highcharts, and Id like to be able to pass data grabbed in Ruby and send to Highcharts.p  pCurrently, Im essentially just creating a string object out of the entire Highcharts javascript and interpolating the ruby data into that. This works, but should I be taking a completely different approach to this Heres exactly what Im doingp  pIve defined a HighChart class with several properties that I want to be able to change via Ruby e.g. chart title, data, etc. The example below which works only sets two of these properties, leaving the rest as defaultp  precode    get  do       chart  HighChart.newoptions                     titletext gt Test Title,                     seriesdata gt                                           Calvin gt [10, 2, 17],                     Hobbes gt [11, 14, 6]                                                                haml index     end codepre  pIm using Hamls javascript filter in the viewp  precodejavascript   chart.chartjs codepre  pSo far so good.

This   could be due to attempting to access a service in a crossdomain way   without a proper crossdomain policy in place, or a policy that is   unsuitable for SOAP services. You may need to contact the owner of the   service to publish a crossdomain policy file and to ensure it allows   SOAPrelated HTTP headers to be sent. This error may also be caused by   using internal types in the web service proxy without using the   InternalsVisibleToAttribute attribute. Please see the inner exception   for more details.p blockquote  pMy thoughts on the error message  I think the stuff about cross domain policy is irrelevant, as this set up is all on one machine. Other than that I dont know what to look for.

Negative 1796 pIm currently working on a quite small project. Im basing my work on smtpd.py but slowly moving toward something completely different.p  pThis is a smtp server. It currently receive and can relay mails. Its pretty straight forwards but I reached a point where im asking myself some questions.p  psmtpd.py use asyncore and asychat. The problem is that it is a single process using an async api. Everything works and I can go further without much problems.p  pThe problem is that if the server is binded on port 25 it must be under the root uid. So here is the big problem. The idea behind the smtp server is that I can implement lots of things using python. I want to be able to access local users, databases or any data store possible. From hashes or anything currently supported by python or I can even add support for it if needed. p  pThe thing is that I feel that having all this control using the root user is very unsecure... what if someone can do something and well endup with a root python shell...p  pSo at first I wanted to create threads and set them a different uid using os.setuid but it doesnt seems to work or can be dangerous too. p  pMy second idea Accept connection then fork and change uid. I should be able to writeread the socket from the forked process and all should be fine.p  pThe third idea was to have a proxy server that relay all messages to a local server that will himself handle the messages.  The only problem with that is that if someone that isnt supposed to use my smtp server the proxy cannot auth or do anything since its just a proxy with no actual access to anything. p  pI believe the fork is the most interesting solution.p  pOr may be there is something I havent tought of yet.p  pAnyway thanksp  pEditp  pApparently if the process is started with root and once the socket is created, it is possible to switch to a different user using os.setuid. I guess its not really portable but thats not a big problem for now. After searching trough the codes of PyramidPylonsPaste I finally came accross that thing The a hrefhttpdocs.python.orglibrarysocketserver.html relnofollowSocketServera module. And Im probably going to use either  ForkingMixIn or ThredingMixIn. It is possible to define the amount of threads etc.p  pIn any case, for people who are wondering why Im not using postfix, exim or qmail.. It is quite simple, Im not really making a smtp server. The smtp protocole is pretty simple if you only implement the minimum required which is receiving emails, accepting or refusing recipient or sender etc.. Escaping the first . of each new line because the RFC says that data ends with rn.rn. p  pAs I see it, python is more like building blocks. The idea isnt to make a smtp server well I will surely implement ESMTP but to make a framework to build your own server. The problem I have and I dont believe that Im alone. Someone designed a config file and a way to configure postfix. Its hardcoded and doesnt fit all case. Making a server that fit all case isnt going to work either. It would probably get huge and ugly. The idea is to make it easy to adds parts you want on your server. If you want to use a database use the one you want with an existing module. Do your query and send back your results. p  pIf you really want to define rules that apply to all domains or to certain domains or even usernames it should be possible to do. p  pI, for example, see a use case. Really strange one but still. How easy would it be to setup that kind of setup on postfix using only one server. You have three domain. a.com, b.com, c.com.p  pa.com send all received mail to a maildir and to b.com with the same username. b.com send all received mail to a maildir and to c.com with the same username. c.com send all received mail to a maildir and to a.com with the same username.p  pNo domain accept email that they already sent.p  pIn other words p  precode           a.com gt b.com gt c.com xgt a.com            b.com gt c.com gt a.com xgt b.com            ...  codepre  pThe idea here is that the mail will get replicated accross multiple domains but it cannot get back to its owner. That kind of use case should be pretty simple. but what if all domain saves their mail in different locations or we want to save the mail every 2 bounce.p  precode a gt b gt csave  a gt bsave gt c  asave gt b gt c  already saved to C so stop the mail would be sent 9 times  codepre

Negative 1796 pIm building a JavaScript compressor and Im at the shrinking local variables stage.  Ive been comparing the results of my compressor with various online compressors and noticed something interesting with a hrefhttpdean.edwards.namepacker relnofollowDean Edwards packera.p  pLets take this snippet of the jQuery library as an examplep  precodefunction window, undefined     var document  window.document,       navigator  window.navigator,       location  window.location  codepre  pMy compressor returns the following codep  precodefunctiona,bvar ca.document,da.navigator,ea.location codepre  pbut packer returns thisp  precodefunctiona,bvar ca.document,navigatora.navigator,locationa.location codepre  pIs there any reason why packer does not shrink variables after the first in a var list  Is it simply a bug or is there a reasonp  pAt first glance it would appear that my compressor is doing the right thing and will give a better final result, however lets look at another example from the jQuery libraryp  precodevar jQuery  function     var jQuery  function selector, context         return new jQuery.fn.init selector, context, rootjQuery      ,      some other vars     rootjQuery      etc...  codepre  pThis snippet is important because the variable coderootjQuerycode is referred to before it is defined.p  pIn this case packer does the same thing and only compresses the first var in the listp  precodevar jQueryfunctionvar cfunctiona,breturn new c.fn.inita,b,rootjQuery,rootjQuery codepre  pHowever my compressor messes up the code a bit because although it does not compress coderootjQuerycode when it is mentioned in the return statement because it has not been defined yet, it does compress it when it is defined later.p  precodevar jQueryfunctionvar afunctionb,creturn new a.fn.initb,c,rootjQuery,b codepre  pThis obviously causes an error when trying to execute the code.p  pIs there any way round this  It looks like Dean Edwards noticed this problem so got around it by only compressing the first var in a list so that on the odd occasion that a case like this pops up, it wont cause an error.p  pI have tried singling out variables that are used before they are defined and not compressing them, but its not that simple because in this case coderootjQuerycode is used at a different scope than it is defined at.  I have no way of knowing which scope it will be defined at until I get to it.p

I have spent over 3 days and countless hours searching for an answer to fixing my live sites report issue with no luck.p  pThere are many fixes out there as long as the site is in development stages and has not gone live, such as truncing a bunch of database tables, but once the site has gone live no one seems to know how to resolve the issuep  pI know that for the most part EAV tables were eliminated with the upgrade and its possible that somehow that could be part of the problem.p  pDoes anyone know what database tables the Products Ordered Report used in version 1.3.3 and if it is the same ones it uses in version 1.6.2.0. If they are different which tables where used then and what tables are used now for the reportp  pOr if you know how to resolve this issue on a live site or have a few suggestions, please dont hold back, I need your helpp  pThank you in advancep

Negative 1796 pI am looking for a timer to put on my website, and the timer would be set for an hour, and after it counts down to zero it resets back to one hour again. It also needs to be universal, so it displays the same for all users and does not reset back to 1hr if you refresh the page. Im guessing this is relatively simple, however all I could find was timers which count to a certain time and stop, or timers which start back at zero after page refresh which is insufficient.p  pIf someone could help, or knows of a link where something like that is available I would greately appreciate itp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 1796 pIm trying to detach a DOM element to append it to another DOM element.

Negative 1796 pIn my program, I am basically reading in a file, doing some processing to it, and then passing it back to the main program  as a memorystream, which will be handled by a streamreader.  This will all be handled by a class beside my main.p  pThe problem is, when I return the memory stream from my method in another class, the canread variable is set to false, and thus causes the streamreader initialization to fail.p  pBelow is an example of the problem happening though in here Im writing to the memorystream in the other class, but it still causes the same error when i pass it back.p  pIn the class named Otherclassp  precodepublic static MemoryStream ImportantStreamManipulator     MemoryStream MemStream  new MemoryStream     StreamWriter writer  new StreamWriterMemStream    using writer            Code that writes stuff to the memorystream via streamwriter         return MemStream      codepre  pThe function calls in the main programp  precodeMemoryStream MStream  Otherclass.ImportantStreamManipulator StreamReader reader  new StreamReaderMStream codepre  pWhen I put a breakpoint on the return MemStream, the CanRead property is still set to true.  Once I step such that it gets back to my main function, and writes the returned value to MStream, the CanRead property is set to false.  This then causes an exception in StreamReader saying that MStream could not be read as the property indicated.  The data is in the streams buffer as it should be, but I just cant get it out.p  pHow do I set it so that CanRead will report true once it is returned to my main  Or am I misunderstanding how MemoryStream works and how would I accomplish what I want to dop
Negative 1796 pWe are in the process of migrating our applications database to Windows Azure SQL Database. Within the application, there are a couple of lightweight search functions, and we currently use TSQL and fulltext indexing to handle the searching. However, fulltext indexing is not currently availabe in Azure.p  pIm looking into nonSQL solutions such as Lucene.Net, which looks great, but I think it might be overkill for what were trying to do. The datasets were searching are not huge  on average less than 100,000 records  and theres only a few of them. An example table might look something like this...p  precodeCREATE TABLE dbo.Items     [ItemID] [int] IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL,     [Author] [varchar]255 NULL,     [Subject] [varchar]255 NULL,     [ItemContent] [nvarchar]max NULL,  CONSTRAINT [PKItems] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED [ItemID] ASC   codepre  p...where we want to search the Author, Subject and ItemContent fields. The Author and Subject can be multiple words, and the ItemContent field can be several paragraphs, so I dont see how I can avoid a Table Scan. The fulltext index performed really well, and Im not looking forward to doingp  pSELECT ItemID FROM dbo.Items WHERE Author LIKE   SearchTerm   OR Subject LIKE   SearchTerm   OR ItemContent LIKE   SearchTerm  p  pAny one have suggestions for ways to optimize this type of searching without using a fulltext indexp
Negative 1796 pIm trying to create a database that contains a list of equipment. All of the equipment will have certain common attributes such as manufacturer, model , serial , etc., then there are other attributes that are specific to a certain piece of equipment ie, a modem will have an access , whereas a solar panel will have an output capacity. Im not sure how to represent these changing attributes with good database design principles, Ive tried searching the web, but Im not entirely sure what to search for. p  pIve come up with the following possible solutions and my initial thoughts on them p  ol lipHave one big table with every possible attribute and just put null where its not applicable. Obviously this has some flaws. pli lipHave a separate table for each equipment type. This seems like it might be a nightmare to use, if I want to print a list of all the equipment, how do I know which tables to lookuppli lipHave a table with the common attributes, and other tables for each equipment type accessed with a foreign key to store the extra attributes. I could probably make this work, but it would be cumbersome and just doesnt feel like a very good solution. pli lipAn entityattributevalue type model. Just doesnt seem like a very good fit for what I want to do. pli ol  pI dont have a lot of experience with databases so Im learning as I go here, any links relating to this problem or must read articles on database design would be appreciated. Thanksp  pEDIT First off, I found out that I needed to Google Inheritance mapping, that might help anyone else that has a similar question. To solve the problem I ended up using a hybrid of 2 and 3. It was actually pretty easy, works well, and solves the problem of adding additional equipment types without the complexity of EAV. Thanks for all the comments and suggestions p

But im getting all alpha is to be negative. For example, the point 0.95144703, 0.57998206 lies above the line a hrefhttpscikitlearn.org0.11autoexamplessvmplotseparatinghyperplane.htmlsee linka. So y  1. If y  1, alpha will be 0.61717729. Similarly for point 1.02126202, 0.2408932 lies below the line. So y  1, and hence alpha  0.04825885.p  pstrongWhy am I getting alpha values to be negativestrong Is my interpretation wrong Any help will be appreciated.p  hr  h2For your reference,h2  pFor the Support Vector Classifier SVC,p  pGiven training vectors , i1,..., n, in two classes, and a vector  such that , SVC solves the following primal problemp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7UW4p.png altenter image description herep  pIts dual isp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvg4KK.png altenter image description herep  pwhere e is the vector of all ones, C  0 is the upper bound, Q is an n by n positive semidefinite matrix, img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkSW34.png altenter image description here and img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsUSjo.png altenter image description here is the kernel.

Negative 1796 pI am copying a large number of files during an ftp session from a remote host to my local machine.  I need to save the files in a local directory tree.  My problem is that a particular directory may not exist before the session.  The way I have handled this in the past is to do set up my script by first creating the directory tree and not even worrying if the directory exists and then from within the same batch file I create the batch file using Python I start my session and use lcd to change to the correct directoryp  precodemd c123 md c234 md c2342009 loginname password cd remotedirectory lcd c123 get somefile.txt codepre  pSo all of the above is written out to one batch file and I start it to run.  If the directory exists when I try to create it then I see a message in the terminal window that the directory exists and since nothing bad happens I have not worried about it.p  pWhat I would really like to do is check the existence of the local directory when I am ready to move to that directory and if it does not exist it gets created but I have not found out how to do this without closing the session and restarting it so I go back to the shell.  p  pIs there a way to do this during the ftp session while maintaining the connection with the host  p

Negative 1796 pI use codeQMakecode to gen code.vcprojcode from code.procode to create DLLs that expose C classes to QML Qt5.0.1MSVC2010.  The DLLs work.p  pHowever, I have two problems they might be relatedp  ol liWhen I build, it ALWAYS recompiles everything in the DLL.  Its never uptodate.li liIf I get a linkfail for example, some input lib doesnt have a neededfunction defined, MSVC will delete all the code.objcode and other intermediate files, requiring the emnextem build to unnecessarily rebuild those intermediates.  The linksuccess will LEAVE the intermediate code.objcode files, but the next build will force them to be regenerated anyway.  This means I can never do a emProject Only  Link Onlyem when I fix an inputstaticlib.li ol  pBoth of these seem weird.  And, they make me sad.p  pNote that since I regenerate the code.vcprojcode each time, there are no filesintheproject that do not exist on disk which others observe as a cause to alwaystriggerrebuild.p  pIve already tried the sillystuff like reinstalling service packs, clean builds, manually removing all intermediatesartifacts, reboot, etc.p  pFrom web searches lots of reading for weeks to get around this, this might be related top  ul liEach DLL has its own directory for its intermedateOBJs, but they all write to the same shareddebugoutput folder for their code.dll.libcode.  That should be fine, rightli ul  pFailing a properfix where MSVC realizes that things are uptodate, is there a workaround where I can emsuppressem the deleteintermediatefiles so I can later force a mere relink, when emI knowem that things should be fine  At present, I cant emProject Only  Link Onlyem because the intermediates get deleted.

Negative 1796 pI am using the WCF Data Services 5.2 to query a db via OData. I will describe my problem bellow, i think can solve it by implementing my own function for filtering data, similar to anyall, but if you have a better solution please feel free to share it.p  pAs a model I have a table containing employees, a table containing all the possible skillsQualifications and a mapping table EQs for the manytomany relationship between employees and skills. Until here everything is easy but the skills table actually represents a tree of skills for example the skill Coding has .Net and Java as children, while .Net has WCF and ASP.NET as children and Java has JSF and Struts as children. The Skills tree is modeled in the skills table with a column called QParentIDeach skill has a single direct parent. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5bsrZ.png altenter image description herep  pIt can happen that an employee only has a relation to WCF or ASP.NET as skills, but when i search for the employees with the skills .NET I should get these employees as well, along with the ones that have a direct link to .NET. For example John has WCF and ASP.NET as skills no direct link to .NET skill but when I search for employees with the skill .NET John should also be in the results. Practically I need to search recursively trough the skills and all of their parents.p  pI was thinking to implement a function that would work similar to anyall.Something like this  codewebserviceEmployeesampfiltermatchesltidgtcode  instead of  codewebserviceEmployeesfilterEQsanye eQualificationID eq ltidgtcode p  pwhich will recursively check if the skills or its parentand parents of the parent match the id.p  pAgain if you have a better solution than this, please feel free to share.p  pThanks in advance for your help.p  pLorip  pEDITIve added a non optimized first draft of the recursive function i would like to implement and use with odatap  precodepublic static bool MatchesIEnumerableltEQgt source, int id              if source  null                      throw new ArgumentNullExceptionsource                  EFEntities entities  new EFEntities         foreach EQ item in source                      if item.QualificationID  id  CheckParententities.Qualifications.Whereqgtq.IDQualification  id.First,id                              return true                               return false           private static bool CheckParentQualification qualification, int id              EFEntities entities  new EFEntities         if qualification.IDQualification  id              return true                  if qualification.QParentID  0              if CheckParententities.Qualifications.Whereq gt q.IDQualification  qualification.IDQualification.First, id                  return true                                return false       codepre  pI copied the signature of the method from the implementation of any method, but instead of a Predicate I use the qualification id as a param.

According to a hrefhttpconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails760609poconavigationproxiesshouldfixuptheotherendautomaticallythis Connect issuea, this is by design.p  blockquote   pHello,    The DbContext template actually doesnt generate classes that will be used as change tracking proxies  just lazy loading proxies which dont do fixup. We made this decision because change tracking proxies are complex and have a lot of nuances that can be very confusing to developers.    If you want fixup to occur before SaveChanges you can call myContext.ChangeTracker.DetectChanges.    EF Teamp blockquote  pAn alternative is to call codeDbContext.Entryentitycode, which will sync up the entity.

When running the project I was suprised that my database connection string was pretty dull .SQLExpress instead of my connection to azure.p  pAfter a long time searching on the web, I tried to move this from web.Development.config p  precode    ltadd nameDatabaseContext connectionStringServertcpxxx.database.windows.net,1433DatabaseltdatabasegtUser IDltlogingtPasswordltpassgtTrustedConnectionFalseEncryptTrue providerNameSystem.Data.SqlClient xdtTransformInsertgt codepre  pto web.config, removing the transform p  precode    ltadd nameDatabaseContext connectionStringServertcpxxx.database.windows.net,1433DatabaseltdatabasegtUser IDltlogingtPasswordltpassgtTrustedConnectionFalseEncryptTrue providerNameSystem.Data.SqlClientgt codepre  pAt this point my database connection string is the right one, so it seems that my web.x.config is not used when running the application. I tried to locate the settings that would let me change that but to no avail. Any idea why this is happening p  pIf this is convention over configuration, my configuration has got the same name as the web.config subfile i.e config  development, file  web.development.configp  pThanks, Stphanep
Negative 1796 pI am attempting to pull some font streams out of a pdf file legality is not an issue, as my company has paid for the rights to display these documents in their original manner  and this requires a conversion which requires the extraction of the fonts.p  pNow, I had been using MUTool  but it also extracts the images in the pdf as well with no method for bypassing them and some of these contain 10s of thousands of images.

Drawing is fast, scrolling is fast. p  pBut there is one problem whenp  ol liUser starts scrolling and releases the screen with speed so the scrollview starts decelerating. li liThen the users taps the scrollview while its still decelerating, causing the scrollview to stop immediately. li ol  pNeither of the codescrollViewDidEndcode functions is called at this moment.

Negative 1796 pIve been doing a lot of searching for a method to find and replace text in a docx file with little luck. Ive tried the docx module and could not get that to work. Eventually I worked out the method described below using the zipfile module and replacing the document.xml file in the docx archive. For this to work you need a template document docx with the text you want to replace as unique strings that could not possibly match any other existing or future text in the document eg. The meeting with XXXCLIENTNAMEXXX on XXXMEETDATEXXX went very well..p  precodeimport zipfile  replaceText  XXXCLIENTNAMEXXX  Joe Bob, XXXMEETDATEXXX  May 31, 2013 templateDocx  zipfile.ZipFileCTemplate.docx newDocx  zipfile.ZipFileCNewDocument.docx, a  with opentemplateDocx.extractworddocument.xml, C as tempXmlFile     tempXmlStr  tempXmlFile.read  for key in replaceText.keys     tempXmlStr  tempXmlStr.replacestrkey, strreplaceText.getkey  with openCtemp.xml, w as tempXmlFile     tempXmlFile.writetempXmlStr  for file in templateDocx.filelist     if not file.filename  worddocument.xml         newDocx.writestrfile.filename, templateDocx.readfile  newDocx.writeCtemp.xml, worddocument.xml  templateDocx.close newDocx.close codepre  pMy question is whats wrong with this method Im pretty new to this stuff, so I feel someone else should have figured this out already. Which leads me to believe there is something very wrong with this approach. But it works What am I missing herep  p.p  pHere is a walkthrough of my thought process for everyone else trying to learn this stuffp  pStep 1 Prepare a Python dictionary of the text strings you want to replace as keys and the new text as items eg.

Negative 1796 pI recently picked up The C Programming Language 2nd ed and have been working my way through the examples in the book. Arrays are giving me problems. Specifically, it seems to have to do with typecasting. The section 1.6 example reads input and then counts how many characters fall into certain categories. This segment of code seems to be creating a segfault when I pipe the source code through the executable, in addition to not properly catching any numeric characters. If I use standard input and D to EOF, then it doesnt catch the numbers at all and instead counts them as other characters although without segfault.p  precodewhile cgetcharEOF   ifcgt0ampampcgt9     ndigit[c0] codepre  pIve eliminated the possibility that its a different part of the program causing the fault by swapping out other sections, but i could post the rest anyway if it helps. To my understanding, this loop should make its way through individual characters in the input. If they have value between 0 and 9, it converts the character to a number corresponding to ndigit array position 09 and increases that array position by 1.p  pIs the KampR 2e sorely outdated Is character encoding ASCII vs Unicode an issue in converting the character number to integer number Any advice would be appreciated.p  pIm not sure how to check my encoding if it even matters but my compiler is gcc UbuntuLinaro 4.7.31ubuntu1 4.7.3p

Negative 1796 pI easily forget to regularly make local git commits, and so ive developed the bad habit of having a few very large commits. Id really like to make lots of small commits.

Im more likely to be successful if I implement a system that pushes me to do this.p  pHeres what Id like, either an Xcode plugin, an Applescript or an xCode behavior trigger that systematically initiates the commit command cmdoption c within Xcode or i suppose id explore alternatives, but itd be nice to stay within xCode.

Negative 1796 pI am looking for basically a repository of information regarding stores. Say I have an app, how would I find all the local stores that sell cellphones I have been using Google search to solve this but no luck. I know this is possible because through the use of Google maps or imaps, you are able to find stores and public locations near you. I want to be able to find the store Items of a store. So i could for example say in my search inapp, What stores will be selling PS4.  This will then display the location of all stores who will be selling PS4. I am not looking for code, Im looking for data where this would be stored, like Data.gov etc...p  pEdit  Thats what I believed Naomi Owens, in regards to the item stock of a store. So since not knowing the stores current Item stock information, a go around would be to find all the stores that would assummingly sell that particular item and then based off assumptions and factual information regarding the release date of said item, notify the user that the queried item will be sold at those retailers based off assumptions. I guess you could then use a percentage system based off of logical assumption the likely hood of a store selling that item. Example Walmart would have a higher likelihood percentage of selling a PS4 than would Fye or some other smaller electronic store.p

Negative 1796 pI just had to migrate a console app written by a previous developer to another server.

Negative 1796 pWhen surfing the web, I often find myself having to reach for the mouse to place focus on a particular input control. For example, I might need to click in a text box to enter my login information. For reasons of efficiency I would prefer to minimise such mouse usage.p  pI am aware that one can usually use the Tab key to cycle between such controls, but usually theres a whole bunch of header links that one has to navigate before reaching the control of interest. Im also aware that some applications e.g. Gmail have builtin shortcut keys, however Im looking for something that will work on generic HTML pages.p  pUsually, once the first control in a form has focus, its easy to Tab between the remaining controls in that form before submitting it.p  pMy question Assuming Im using Firefox 24.0, is there an existing addon which will speed up using keyboard shortcuts the task of setting focus to an arbitrary input control on the page e.g. the first text box in a formp  pI imagine that such an addon would listen for a certain key combination e.g. CtrlShiftF, upon which it would display tooltiplike information on each visible input control which specifies the subsequent key e.g. a, b, c etc that will cause the corresponding controllink to be focused.p  pDoes anybody know of such an addon, or am I perhaps looking at this problem the wrong wayp

Negative 1796 pOn a Dell Inspiron One TouchScreen Allinone computer, Im trying to use startTouchDrag but it is not working. The monitor sends TouchEvent.TOUCHBEGIN and TouchEVENT.TOUCHEND but no TOUCHMOVE when I drag my finger. My event handlers are running correctly when I touch and let go but the Sprite is not dragging. Any ideas what could be missingp  h2Backstoryh2  pI have an AIR application which ran fine on an ELO touch screen. The user would drag certain items and place them into a bucket. The application listened for MouseEvent.MOUSEDOWN, upon which it would start startDragDrop. On MouseEvent.MOUSEUP it would do stopDragDrop. On the Dell, it didnt work because when you touch the screen, it fires a simultaneous MOUSEDOWN then MOUSEUP event... which respectively runs startDragDrop then stopDragDrop immediately killing the drag and drop functionality. Only the TouchEvents fire correctly upon touching and letting go.p

Negative 1796 pIve been banging my head against the wall trying to fix this. Pretty sure I lost some hair today.p  pBasically, we were given a few working classes and were asked to implement RMI on it. There were some errors in the given code to begin with, but I fixed them. Now I get no errors at all, and it isnt working.p  pHere are the classesp  pcodeGameClient.javacode  done by mep  precodeimport java.rmi.RemoteException import java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject

Now, the steps that should be taken are as followsp  ol liCreate your codeGameClientcode class which implements our codeIGUIcode and codeIGameEnginecode interfaces. It will locate the server using the registry, and will accept local calls from the codeGUIcode, translating them to remote calls on the server and returning any results.li liChange the codeGUIcode class so that its reference to a codeGameEnginecode is of type codeIGameEnginecode insteadli liThe codeSquarescode class, which will start the clientside part of the game, will now need to create an instance of the codeGameClientcode and pass it to the codeGUIcode as its reference to an codeIGameEnginecodeli liCreate your codeGameServercode class which implements our codeIGameServercode interface, and also contains a codemaincode method to start the server and game engineli liChange the codeGameEnginecode class so that its reference to a codeGUIcode is now of type codeIGUIcode this will be its remote reference to a client. You will need to catch some exceptions as the codeGameEnginecode is now calling the codeGUIcode remotely.li liCompile what you have done, fixing any errors you come across, then try running your distributed game. You may see some runtime exceptions which you will also need to address.li ol  pThese are the recommended steps.

My first idea was to use the UnivariateSpline function of scipy, but the problem is that this does not consider the small noise in a good way. If you consider the frequencies, the background is much smaller than the signal, so a spline only of the cutoff might be an idea, but that would involve a back and forth fourier transformation, which might result in bad behaviour. Another way would be a moving average, but this would also need the right choice of the delay.p  pAny hints books or links how to tackle this problemp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combcaCP.png altexamplep
Negative 1796 pIm trying to get strongvagrant to provision a VM with two network interfacesstrongp  ul lieth0 NATvirtualbox type interface that talks to DHCPli lieth1 hostonlyvirtualbox interface with a strongstaticstrong IPli ul  pOn virtualbox everything works. I get eth0 as a NAT type inteface that connects to the internet via DHCP and eth1 as a static IP with which I can connect to from the virtualbox host I just need to add a private subnet to the virtualbox settings. However when I package this VM and try to deploy it as a box from vagrant strongI am unable to get eth1 to be brought up automatically as the MAC address gets changed by Vagrantstrong which means the static network configuration wont apply to itp  pBy default on vagrant the first adapter is always set as a NATed interfance. This means I dont need to actually add anything in the vagrantfile for eth0. p  pFor eth1 Ive added the following in the Vagrantfilep  pconfig.vm.network privatenetwork,ip192.168.100.201,mac  080027df863a, adapter  2p  pstrongThe problemstrong when I boot the vm vagrant up a strongnew MAC is assignedstrong for eth1. As a result the static IP mapping that I already have in etcsysconfignetworkscriptsifcfgeth1 is invalid as it points to the MAC that was assigned when I create the VM in virtualbox.p  pIf I delete the VM from virtualbox, repackage it and deploy a VM via vagrant with the same configuration the interface will get added but again the MAC address is different and no initialization script will exist in etcsysconfignetworkscriptsp  pTLDR I want to create a vagrant box that has eth0 as a NATed interface DHCP and eth1 as a static hostonly interface static IP.

The issue Im having is a javascript formatting script does not seem to be working on an input type of strongnumberstrong, but it does work on an input type of text.  Working fiddle belowp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netTFME5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netTFME5ap  pIn Firefox, if you just start typing in numbers in both fields, itll auto format both as a US social security number 123456789.  If you try the same in Chrome where number type is supported, youll see it wont work in the number text field. It basically wipes out the value when the formatting script starts writing out the hyphen.p  pMy theory here is that the formatting script is outputting an invalid number, i.e., when it rewrites something like 1234, it bombs out because thats not a valid floating point number.p  pI pretty much fleshed out this theory by keying in 1234 in the number field, then hitting the updown arrows in that fields chrome.  Up gives you 1, down gives 1, so 1234 is being treated as 0, which Im assuming is the browser saying nopep  pWhere this is problematic for me is on mobile where, on numeric entry, I want to present a numeric keyboard with input typenumber, but that doesnt look like its going to happen with the autoformatting.  Im running into the same problems with autoformatting dates with .  Again, assuming its because Im ouputting invalid numbers.p  pThe autoformatting works fine on mobile when using input typetext, but you dont get the nicer UX keyboard feature with a numeric keyboard.  Also, input typetel doesnt give me any problems, but then Im assuming this is because that hyphen is valid in that contextp  pHas anyone run into this before Is my theory soundp  precodeFormatSSN  functione  var val  this.value.replaceDg, , only want numbers     len  val.length,     first,     middle,     last  if len gt 3 ampamp len lt 6      first  val.slice0,3     middle  val.slice3,5     this.value  first    middle  else if len gt 5      first  val.slice0,3     middle  val.slice3,5     last  val.slice5,9     this.value  first    middle    last    document.onkeyup, ssntext, FormatSSN document.onkeyup, ssnnumber, FormatSSN codepre

Negative 1796 pI had an old lamp server that I wanted to move to a new machine, so I did a mysqldump, installed Ubuntu Server 13.10 on a new machine, installed lamp during installation, then imported my old mysql databases from the old lamp server. Everything seemed to work perfect right after the mysql import, to my surprise.p  pThen I tried setting up a cron job to mysqldump all databases every hour to a backup server. Just to make sure it worked, I tried manually running mysqldump on the new server just to make sure it worked instead of waiting for the cron job to run.

Negative 1796 pI have learned recently that anonymous functions can carry around large amounts of unused data, even if this data is created after the anonymous function is instantiated. The following example, together with the FUNCTIONS comand, illustrates this,p  precodefunction funtest place in an mfile          a1         b2         c3          funxxba          a7         brand1000         c5          q3         r4 end codepre  pNow, back in the base workspace, when I apply the functions command to fun, I seep  precodegtgt funtest sfunctionsfun s.workspace      ans             b 2           a 1      ans             fun xxba             a 1             b [1000x1000 double]             c 3 codepre  pI would like to understand with official documentation if possible what rules anonymous functions use to decide what data to carry around. The above seems to suggest that codes.workspace1code will always contain the external variables and their values that the anonymous function actually uses. Meanwhile codes.workspace2code seems to contain updates to variables that came into scope embeforeem codefuncode was defined. Am I correct that these are the rules But if so, then why, in the above, does codes.workspace2code contain an update to b, but not to a and cp  pThese things seem important to understand, since obviously, I can end up carrying large amounts of unintended memory that was allocated after my anonymous function was created.p

Negative 1796 pI have written a library which comprises of function and two thread functions. From the user program I will call the function inside the library with Drive id as parameter. The function creates threads according to no of Drive Id I have given. Then this thread function will process the drive getting list of folders from the drive and put it in a queue. Once it finishes it will call certain amount of threads which i initialized with MAXThreads and these child threads will process the queue and put list of files inside the drive in their corresponding vector.

Negative 1796 pIm working on a project that is written in Java that uses Z3 a hrefhttpz3.codeplex.com relnofollowhttpz3.codeplex.coma.  Basically, Z3 creates a temporary file in a specified directory, uses it, and then deletes it.  Z3 is executed from inside some Java code.  The original permissions for the readwrite directory were rwxrwxrx and the Java code was throwing a FileNotFoundException Permission denied exception.  We have changed these permissions to 777 to allow Z3 to run properly.  No exceptions are being thrown now.p  pI want to know if there is a more proper way to handle this so the directory isnt completely vulnerable with the 777 permissions.  Is there a better permissions scheme to handle this  Z3 is being executed in a separate thread, if that is useful.p  pEdit This code is a web application running on a Tomcat server, which is running on an Ubuntu system.p

Negative 1796 pCan somebody explain this calculation and give a lucid explanationp  blockquote   pA quick calculation shows that if the seek time is around 10 ms and the transfer rate is 100 MBs, to make the seek time 1 of the transfer time, we need to make the block size around 100 MB. The default is actually 64 MB, although many HDFS installations use 128 MB blocks. This figure will continue to be revised upward as transfer speeds grow with new generations of disk drives.p blockquote

Negative 1796 pOkay, I messed something up. Ive written in C a DLL which I call from the managed code C .NET. The library works like diamonds and is blazingly fast. p  pMy DLL uses its internal state i.e. allocates heaps of memory and uses myriad of variables which are not cleared off between the calls from .NET. Instead they stay there and C code is aware of that there is preprocessing and building data structures, actually this is required for performance.p  pSo what is the problem I want to add multithreading, effectively by allowing each .NET thread access his own DLL. Without storing any data between the calls it would be easy achievable with just one DLL.

As the order of these parameters within each line can change, i cant simply stick the first value in one variable each time, I have to refer to them specifically by what their name is identifier, messagecount etc.p  pCan anyone help Thanks. I guess it would be via a regular expression, but im not too hot on those. Id prefer to have each expression for each paramater within its own statement, rather than being all in one, thanks.p

Negative 1796 pI have two buttons in my Activity. When I click on button1, I display a fragment and when I click on button2, I display another fragment in the same container. For each fragment I am setting a tag so that if the button is clicked again, I will just replace the fragment in the container. The problem is when i click again on the second button, the findFragmentByTag returns null and the fragment is loaded again.

Negative 1796 pI am totally new to Cloud9 IDE, so my question amy be silly, but i cant find answer in docs. I want to make client  server application with Node.js  MongoDB as socket server, and client   desktop application which I debug and run on my machine Cloud9 IDE doesnt support language on which I write it. Looking at Cloud9 IDE Ive found it very nice for developing serverside part of my application and may be as hosting solution. But I cant find how to make socket connection from client. For this I need to know IP adress or domain address of my server I suppose it looks like  a hrefhttpssocialcrmc9painkkkiller.c9.io relnofollowhttpssocialcrmc9painkkkiller.c9.ioa and port number. In docs Ive found about use process.env.PORT as the port and process.env.IP as the host in your scripts but to connect to server I need they real values Commands console.logprocess.env.PORT and console.logprocess.env.IP gives me just 8080 and 0.0.0.0 Using a hrefhttpssocialcrmc9painkkkiller.c9.io relnofollowhttpssocialcrmc9painkkkiller.c9.ioa as domain and 8080 as port gives me socket error. So is it possible at all And if possible how to do itp

Negative 1796 pContextp  pI have an ASP.NET WebForms Website not a Web Application that Im reimplementing in a new ASP.NET MVC Web Application with a new CMS. These sites will have the same secondlevel domain, but different host names e.g. site1.site.com and site2.site.com.p  pThe WebForms site is quite large, so Ill be migrating parts of the WebForms site over to the MVC site over a long period of time. Once all of content of the WebForms site has been moved over to the MVC site, the WebForms site will be retired, and both host names will point to the MVC site.p  pProblemp  pThe WebForms site uses Basic Authentication and the MVC site uses Forms Authentication. Both talk to the same authentication service on the backend, and take the same credentials from the user.p  pI dont want users to have to sign in to these sites separately they should only see one sign in prompt. This appears to be possible if both sites use Forms Authentication, but is it possible to set this up when one site uses Forms Authentication and the other uses Basic Authenticationp  pSpecifically, is it possible for a user to sign in to the site using Forms Authentication and be authenticated on the Basic Authentication site, and vice versap

Negative 1796 pWe have an application that is running on an HP Slate 21 Pro with Android 4.3, the tablet and application function in the context of a kiosk where users can walkup to it to perform a task.p  pThe application is quite small and has two screensp  pThe first screen allows the entry of a employee number, this input is taken using an attached RFID USB reader which reads a card. The RFID readers acts using keyboard emulation to populate a hidden field and submit the number using an Async task to a back end API.p  pOnce the user scans their card they are effectivley signed in and a second activity loads, looks up data relevant to the user using an Async task, and displays the data user. At which point the user can select items on the screen.p  pThe issue we are having is after loading this activity with a users data the application does not respond to any touch events, all buttons are not clickable nor respond. In addition the tablets Home, Back, and Recent Items button do not function either. All buttons are not changing state when pressed as well.p  pIt would appear the screen is locked and not taking user input. The challenge is that this does not happen all the time, nor have we been able to reproduce the issue anywhere but in the field production.p  pThe initial thought was something was blocking the Main thread, however on the screen that is loaded after the user logs in there is a screen timeout initiated using a Handler to post a delayed timeout call where if the user does not interact with the screen they are taken back to the main screen, effectively acting as logging the user out for inactivity. This handler is firing and returning the user to the main activity.p  pOnce back to the main screen the tablet does still not respond to touch events, however the user can scan their card repeating the process to log in and are taken to the same screen at which point the same behavior exists where the screen does not respond to touch events.p  pHere is the base activity that the screen timeout is implemented inp  precodepublic abstract class BaseActivity extends Activity       Override     public void onResume          super.onResume         resetDisconnectTimer           Override     public void onStop          super.onStop         stopDisconnectTimer           Override     public void onUserInteraction         resetDisconnectTimer           public void quitView view           InputMethodManager imm  InputMethodManagergetSystemServiceContext.INPUTMETHODSERVICE         if imm  null              imm.hideSoftInputFromWindowview.getWindowToken, 0                   Intent intent  new Intentthis, MainActivity.class         intent.setFlagsIntent.FLAGACTIVITYCLEARTOP         startActivityintent           public void resetDisconnectTimer         disconnectHandler.removeCallbacksdisconnectCallback         disconnectHandler.postDelayeddisconnectCallback, 10000           public void stopDisconnectTimer         disconnectHandler.removeCallbacksdisconnectCallback           private Handler disconnectHandler  new Handler         public void handleMessageMessage msg                     private Runnable disconnectCallback  new Runnable          Override         public void run              quitgetWindow.getDecorView                     codepre  pI have done some testing where I intentionally block the Main thread and the timeout will  not fire until the thread is unblocked which leads me to believe the thread is not being blocked.p  pEventually after a shore period of time around 10 to 30 seconds the application starts responding to touch events again.p  pstrongEDIT 20140930strongp  pI am starting to suspect something besides the software causing an issue as this device has a hardware settings button that will open the settings application. p  pWhen the application freezes this hardware button opens the settings screen. However the settings application experiences the same behavior as the original application as it does not respond to touch events.p  pstrongEDIT 20141002strongp  pI have confirmed that other input devices when the touch screen does not. I was able to attach a mouse when this situation occurs. I used the mouse to navigate to the home screen and then to the settings screen. During this time the touch screen did not respond however the device was responding to the mouse clicks. This is leading me to believe there is a hardware issue with the touch screen.p

Negative 1796 pAt the core, my Android application consists of navigating between panels that fetch and display content. Each panel calls codefetchContentcode on a background thread, and then after the content is fetched, codefetchContentcode calls a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidappActivity.htmlrunOnUiThreadjava.lang.Runnable relnofollowrunOnUiThreadcodedisplayContentcodea , to display the content. When the user switches panels, an event called codepanelSwitchcode is called.p  pIf the user switches panels before the content is fetched, then codepanelSwitchcode cancelsinterrupts codefetchContentcode, which in turn handles the interruption by not calling codedisplayContentcode. However, I was thinking that if there is stuff already happening on the UI thread when the user switches panels, then codepanelSwitchcode is pushed to the back of the event queue. Then, if the background thread finishes fetching the content before codepanelSwitchcode reaches the front of the queue, then coderunOnUiThreaddisplayContentcode will push codedisplayContentcode to the end of the event queue, after codepanelSwitchcode.

Negative 1796 pWe have a USB accessory that uses the Open Accessory Protocol to send USB data packets to an App running on Android smart phones. This works very well when the Android device is running Jelly Bean JB or Ice Cream Sandwich ICS, but gives the following errors with devices running Kitkatp  p1      Data packets sent by the accessory arent received by the App. For some reason the low level USB interface on the device isnt providing these packets to the Application. 2      Packets that are delivered to the App are sometimes corrupt or incomplete, e.g. were seeing corrupt packets or partially delivered packets.p  pWe have now modified our accessory software to make sure that every USB data packet is transmitted as a multiple of 64 bytes. This wasnt necessary on JB or ICS, but has made some improvement to the Kitkat interface. But we are still missing the majority of data packets.p  pHas anyone had any experience of interfacing to Kitkat via the AOAP Has anyone had problems with USB data communications with Kitkat that are not present with Jelly Bean or Ice Cream Sandwichp

Negative 1796 pFirst I want to say that Im in a programming school atm, and in the course called project development I received a half finished project from seniors to continue. So needless to say I dont know the project by heart and that paired with my inexperience, I hope you can forgive my possibly stupid questions.p  pIt is a Maven Web Application, the language used is Java. The database is a simpe JAVA DB Derby, the server is Glassfish 4.0. Both are used within the Netbeans 8.0 environment. p  pNow to the actual problem. The App is a online Questionnaire creation tool, so the user can create Questions, answers, upload a picture etc.. And it does work, everything is stored in the DB and persisted, I checked manually and the data is there and stays there after closing the App. However as soon as I relaunch the App, all DB content is lost. Yet not quite entirely, it seems that only the ID gets deleted, since when I upload a picture again, the old ones having the same ID that I uploaded last session appear instead.p  pOfc, my first thought was the persistence.xml and I did set it Table Generation Strategy to none. Here is my persistence.xml EclipseLinkJPA 2.1p  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltpersistence version2.1 xmlnshttpxmlns.jcp.orgxmlnspersistence xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xsischemaLocationhttpxmlns.jcp.orgxmlnspersistence httpxmlns.jcp.orgxmlnspersistencepersistence21.xsdgt   ltpersistenceunit nameOnlineTestCreatorPU transactiontypeJTAgt     ltjtadatasourcegtjdbconlinetestcreatordbltjtadatasourcegt     ltpropertiesgt     ltpropertiesgt   ltpersistenceunitgt ltpersistencegt codepre  pThis didnt solve the issue either, so next I went to the glassfishressources.xml and removed the createtrue Properties. This didnt solve it either.p  pI heard from a friend that sometimes the programm doesnt rebuild with the new settings properly and I have to make sure it cleans correctly. So I cleaned the App 10 times succesfully and Build everything again and tried but still no result. I also made sure that the DB name matched up with the entries in my persistence.xml and glassfishressources.xml. I am honestly at the end of my rather limited knowledge.p  pSo what could be causing all my DB content to dissapear everytime I launch the Appp  pIf anything is missing and you need further information just let me know and Ill try to provied it to the best of my ability.p

Negative 1796 pcurrently I am working with MSSQL server either 2008R2 or 2012 and Id like to ask if multiple DML statements put in one procedure can cause significant performance hit dropp  pAs I was told, the rule of thumb here is to put each DML statement into separate stored procedure and call them from one wrapper procedure.p  pAccording to what Ive been told, the thing making the performance worse is a fact, that when multiple DMLs are in one procedure, no good execution plan for that one can be created and stored. On the other hand, when DMLs are separated in own procedures, the propriate execution plan is crated for each one.p  pLast thing worth mentioning is, that I am going to wrap all DMLs in one explicit transaction  no matter if in one procedure or in separate ones.p  pAre multiple DML statements in one procedure really that much of a problem p  pThanks.p

Negative 1796 pIs there any way to find out if a YamlMappingNode is merged to perform a merge operation Im coming from Java and SnakeYaml where you have a class codeMappingNodecodeand a property codeisMergedcode. Usually you would do a codeifcode to see if it is merged and if yes you would start to flatten the mapping via codeSafeConstructorflattenMappingMappingNodecode.p  pOr does the parser automatically recognise back references and merge it Normally if the parser matches the specific tag representing the merge scalar a hrefhttpyaml.orgtypemerge.html relnofollowhttpyaml.orgtypemerge.htmla youd set it. This happens in the Java version of the YAML parser SnakeYaml.p

Negative 1796 pIm attempting to do something rather difficult, and it seems to me git should be able to help.  My team is migrating onto a new engineering system, and the new system uses git.

Once it has arrived, the promise returned by codewaitForMessagecode is being resolved and the event handler removed.p  pIn codeloopcode, a new promise is being generated by codewaitForMessagecode as soon as the job enqueued by resolving the previous promise is being run.p  pNow my question is whether codeloopcode may not get all messages posted at window due to a timing problem If the jobs enqueued by codePromise.prototype.resolvecode are not always being run before any tasks enqueued in the browsers event loop, it may be the case that an codemessagecode event is begin dispatched at codewindowcode while there is currently no handler listening for this event.p  pWhat does the standard say about the timing of these different types of jobstasks, namely resolving the callbacks of promises and the dispatching of events from outside of the ES6 worldp  pI just took the codemessagecode event as an example, I am equally interested in other events, like codeclickcode or codepopstatecode events.p  pP.S. As this has been asked for several times in the comments below, let me describe what I was hoping for with the above codep  pI would like to use ES6 features to avoid having to deal too much with callbacks in my code and to make sure that added event listeners are removed in time to avoid memory leaks.

Removal of the event handler is guaranteed when the inner function returns.p  pIt is well known that generators in ES6 can also be used for handling promises like the codeasynciocode package does in Python 3.4. There is proposal for ES7 to include some sugar for these async functions, namely a hrefhttpsgithub.comlukehobanecmascriptasyncawait relnofollowhttpsgithub.comlukehobanecmascriptasyncawaita. I was hoping to use this sugar which is supported by Traceur at the moment to sugarize my above codeloopcode function. However, the proposed async functions only deal with promises so I tried to rewrite my loop code in a fashion that produces a result of promises, the result of which I posted at the beginning of my question.p

I want to do this for both X and Y. I also want to be flexible with the ticks and draw either all of them or maybe skip some of them.

I will change these increments too. p  pI tried to show what I want the graph look like in the second image. I want roughly the labels shown in red boxes only.

Negative 1796 pI have been going at this for days. I have created a IE addon that registers and works great on 32bit IE. My problem occurs when I try to get it running on 64bit Windows 7. As I found out, IE on 64 runs both 32 and 64. So trying to run my addon by registering the 32bit dll using the 32bit regasm gets it working. However, Registering the 64bit dll using the 64 bit regasm doesnt work. If i run IE in enhanced protected mode, the addon works.p  pI am trying to get the IE to run my 64bit addon without enhanced protected mode on as other addons that are required only run on 32bit EI and thus are disabledincompatible when using enhanced mode.

Negative 1796 pMy company is uploading large archive files to S3, and now wants them to be unzipped on S3. I wrote a lambda function based on unzip, triggered by arrival of a file to the xxxzip bucket, which streams the zip file from S3, unzips the stream, and then streams the individual files to the xxxdata bucket. p  pIt works, but I find it is much slower than I expect  even on a test file, zip size about 500k and holding around 500 files, this is timing out with a 60 second timeout set.

It seems to me that since files are being moved inside Amazons cloud latency should be short, and since the files are being streamed the actual time taken should be about the time it takes to unzip the stream.p  pIs there an inherent reason why this wont work, or is there something in my code that is causing it to be so slow It is the first time Ive worked with node.js so I could be doing something badly.

Negative 1796 pI am currently looking at Roman Nuriks WizardPager and trying to figure the code out. So my question is the following, he makes use of already created pages and then just sends custom data to those pages. So he has one page which has a list of check boxes and another where he can add a comment, but all these pages are fixed and determined at compile time.p  pI want to know if anyone knows of a way to generate these pages at runtime So without knowing how they will look or what content they will have, is it possible to do this using a WizardPager So for example, I want to create 10 pages at runtime and each page has different content to displayinteract with. So page 1 would have 2 edittexts and 2 check boxes and page 2 would have 3 radio buttons and an imageview for examplep

Negative 1796 pEdit There seems to be a problem with my sliding tabs fragment ATabs. Without using the ATabs fragment and just switching between fragment A1 and B using the navigation drawer, everything works fine Adding ListItems is possible. Edited MainActivityp  precodeOverride public void onNavigationDrawerItemSelectedint position      mFragment  null     switch position          case 0             mFragment  A1.newInstanceposition  1, this             break         case 1             mFragment  B.newInstanceposition  1             break          onSectionAttachedposition     FragmentManager fragmentManager  getSupportFragmentManager     fragmentManager.beginTransaction             .replaceR.id.container, mFragment             .commit      mFragment  null  codepre  pBut as soon as I use the ATabs fragment see MainActivity below and switched to it and back, strongadding ListItems isnt possible anymorestrong. Though Logcat shows codeLog.vLOGTAG, Added Itemcode everytime I press add .p  pI have no idea what causes the problem. If the ATabs needs to be an Activity instead a Fragment or if my PagerAdapter is causing the problem. In my ATabs class tried using the two different PagerAdapters p  precodepublic static class MyAdapter extends FragmentStatePagerAdapter   ...  codepre  pand p  precodepublic static class MyAdapter extends FragmentPagerAdapter   ...  codepre  pThe latter even caused the whole fragments not do display properly and the switching between the tabs wasnt possible too.p  hr  pI have a navigation drawer that displays two different fragments ATabs and B. Fragment ATabs contains two sliding tabs. Each tab holds another Fragment A1 and A2. Until now A2 and B are just empty fragments with a simple TextView, so basically the same A2  B. Fragment A1 has a codeListViewcode with some predefined codeEditTextcode items when the app starts. The user can add additional EditText Items by pressing on add inside the custom action bar for this particular fragment A1.p  pIn general fragment A1 should have different action bar items than fragment A2 and B. This seems to work already. For that I added set codesetHasOptionsMenutruecode to each fragment, override the codeonCreateOptionsMenucode method including codemenu.clearcode and setting the desired menu from the resources.p  pHere is already my first question Is it necessary to do this inside all fragments that would use the default main activity action bar anywayp  pstrongAnd my main problem is adding additional items to the list viewstrongp  pWhen I switch between the initial fragment A1  displayed when the app starts  to fragment A2 and back to A1 inside ATabs fragment everything works fine. I can add additional items and previous added items are also still visible.  But once I switched between fragment B and A1 using the navigation drawer I cannot add any items anymore and also dont see my previously added items. I will use a database later to store my items but it should be still possible to add additional items as before.p  pstrongHere are some screens to better demonstrate my problemstrongp  pApp starts with A1 fragment, switching between A1 and A2, adding is possible with  itemp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWDE6V.png altATabs fragmentp  pAfter I switch between ATabs and B using navigation drawer, add item  gets displayed but has no effect on fragment A1.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comd76VJ.png altnav drawer, frag B, not able to addp  pstrongHere is my MainActivity that holds the navigation drawerstrong I am not really sure if the switching inside codeonNavigationDrawerItemSelectedcode between the fragments is correct or if I create new fragments everytime I switch.

Negative 1796 pThis may be an obvious No, but here goes...p  pIm using TestFlight, and I like to add build notes in the What to test field on the TestFlight page in iTunes Connect. However, the only way any users will actually see those notes is if youre able to slip them in and hit Save before the build finishes processing. If you add them after that point, the users dont ever know What to test because neither the email notification nor the TestFlight app itself will show the notes This is absolutely ridiculous, of course, so is there another way Itd be great if you could add a build the way you add an app i.e. before you actually submit anything.p

Negative 1796 pI was just put in charge of our departments documentations. It is a mess right now 300. We have documentations for every inhouse tools created with Microsoft Office MSWord, Excel and Access since 2006 and made in Excel and Word. And those documents can hold user howto information, technical information or VBASQL information for the programmers. My challenge is to put all those documents together and be able to search all of them for specific words. Like if I want to search for a table name, I would type tblSomething and I would get a result of all documents with that specific word andor even a list of which tool is using that table. p  pSo basically I am looking for some kind of document manager. I dont mind if I have to redocopypaste those documents into something else if needed.p  pI am ready to look into free stuff or paying ones. Any suggestions Thanks.p

Each listview row has a view which I load in a task asynchronously. When the task finishes it sets the bitmap into the imageView. There is no point in showing the code as I am sure it is correct. At the beginning I started using ListFragment for simplicity and everything worked fine. The listviews scroll smoothly and the async task are executed for the views inside the same fragment as the user scrolls down. But then I realized I need to customize the listview, so I created my own layout and set it to the ListFragment as the android developer docs states using a predefined id for the listview so the ListFragment can find it overriding onCreateView. And here comes the strange thing Everything goes fine but NOW when the user scrolls and the asynctasks finish and sets the bitmap the viewpager recreates the whole views of the selected fragment and the adjacent one which causes more asynctask to be executed and the cycle repeats everytime an asynctask sets a bitmap. This causes a lot of freezing when the user scrolls due to the massive redraw and asynctask calls. I have also tried to create a custom Fragment not inheriting from ListFragment with a listview but it happens the same, the viewpager recreates unnecesary views everytime a thread sets a bitmap into a row. Someone please can explain me WHY this doesnt happen when I use ListFragment and it does happen in the other case How can I solve it Thanks in advance.p  pstrongEDITstrongbr I found the issue. Surprisingly it is in the listview xml layoutbrp  precodeltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidlayoutwidthmatchparent     androidlayoutheightmatchparent gt      ltListView         androidididandroidlist         androidlayoutwidthmatchparent         androidlayoutheightmatchparent         androidlayoutmarginLeft8dp         androidlayoutmarginRight8dp         androidbackgroundcolorwhite gt     ltListViewgt  ltRelativeLayoutgt codepre  pIf I set the listview property codeandroidlayoutheightwrapcontentcode instead of matchparent then it recreates the views of the adjacent pages and itself unnecesary everytime a bitmap is set asynchronously. The problem now is that I cannot set the height to wrapcontent thus even if a listview has a few items it is drawn till the bottom which is ugly. Any suggestions pleasep

Is there some way that Google tracks an appp  pI mean, they could include informations like hardware configuration and other computer related stuff into an apk in order to uniquely fingerprint an app. As a result, although an app has been signed by different keys they are still able to determine which apps belong togetherp  pDo they do something like that when you create an apkp

Negative 1796 pI have many pages on my a google sites , those pages are not quite related and I have to give access for each page to a specific list of users. Google only offer me to add users to Toplevel page , so I need to add all users then for each page Ill need to manually chose from all users added on top level who stays and who delete .  This seems that it will take a lot of time , I have like 30 pages and more than 120 user so ...p  pI already have the lists for each page , I want just for each page add a list of users .p
Negative 1796 pIm writing a notetaking application for Android, and I have a RecyclerView to display a grid of all the notes. Each note has a respective class called Note.p  pemThe note class knowshasemp  ul liThe filename Notes titleli liThe file path for the noteli liA loading method that reads and returns the text inside the fileli ul  pThe recyclerview reads from a ArrayList of Note. The list is populated by a scan of files in the Apps note directory, and a Note object is created for each file. Im trying to find the best way to load the text into the recyclerview, which displays a preview of the notes. Im wondering if theres a best way, or least stupid way to do this. The ways I can think of doing this arep  ul liLoad every notes content at once during the initial scan and save it as a string in the note class in RAM, the downside being very high RAM usage with alot of notes and text.li liLoad the notes text in the Recylerviews strongonBindViewHolderstrong method, but Im worried if the user is scrolling through notes very fast, and a ViewHolder and its note are unbound before the text is loaded, there could be possible issues here.li liLoad each notes text in a threadpool, increases performance but same issue as above.li ul  pIs there a best way to do this, or a recommendedstandard way to handle alot of files loading dynamically into a recyclerviewp
Negative 1796 pIm searching a slider like, whichs animation is acting like a card deck. So i want to be able to drag new slides from left and right as you can see here a hrefhttpowlgraphic.comowlcarouseldemosautoHeight.html relnofollowhttpowlgraphic.comowlcarouseldemosautoHeight.htmla but with a card deck like behaviour. So the Slides shouldnt be pushed away but stacked on top of each other. So when you drag a new slide from the right slideleft, it should be stacked on top of the current slide. If you drag to the right, the subjacent slide gets visible again.p  pA bit like in this slider here when you click next and previous buttons wowslider.comdejqueryslidercarouselmacstackdemo.htmlp  pBut not exactly like that and it should be draggable not only by click..p

I realize I wrote a lot so if you wish to skip it I am having trouble understanding line lt44. p  pIt was pretty easy to see that the input was 6 characters, so I entered a random guess hitherp  pMoving to line 38 I see that eax  ebx is being moved into the cl register, which as I understand it is the first 8 bytes if ecx. I noticed that my string was stored in ebx, so seeing as eax is incremented from 0 to 5 while this line is being called I assumed that it is storing the decimal value of the ascii character at the eax element of my string in cl. p  pMoving to the next line that was correct. Anding ecx with 0xf 0x1111 was putting a mask on and reducing ecx down to the first 4 bytes, aka a number between 0 and 15. p  pLine 44 is where I got confused.p  pAs I understand add, the line should set edx  ecx4  valueat0x804a460. When I inspected the 0x804a460 address it contained the value 2. For the first iteration of my loop masking the character h left me with the decimal number 8. So I assumed that edx would be set to 34, yet after that line it was set to 4. p  pSo this line is increasing edx 6 times based on the masked value of my character. Seeing the cmp on line 57 0x36 and edx I knew at the end I needed to end up with 54.p  pThe i, which was masked to 9, increased my edx by 7. The t, h and r increased my edx by 12, 16, and 6 respectively. p  pSo given 546  9, and given I have no idea what this add line is doing, I decided to run another string through and see if I could find a masked character that increased my edx by 9.p  pI looked at an ascii table and decided to put in kwsqfm which when masked equals 11731613 in decimal. I then just went through each step of the loop and checked how much each decimal value was increasing edx. p  pTo my pleasant surprise, f ended up increasing edx by 9. So I simply put in ffffff as my password and defused the phase.p  pIm not entirely satisfied with how I found this answer because of the brute force method I used. Even though there were really only 15 masked values to check I would rather understand what exactly is going on here.p  pLine lt44 is undoubtedly what is causing me trouble. If anyone could help me understand that add statement I would be very grateful. p

Negative 1796 pYep, subjective question. But here are a lot of such questions that got good answers. So now I have to try to develop some REST API with Erlang, as I got from google I have to install some webserver, such as Cowboy, Webmachine, Yaws, Mociweb. But all information I can find is too old and seems to be nonactual. So what server still keeps on developing and how can I choose one for me Am I wrong at all at this wayp

Heres what we are trying to dop  pWe would like to check the integrity of images in a file system with a lot of folders and multilevel subfolders, and each child folder contains multiple images. Since Windows allows to view images as large icons which made us super easy to check the quality of each image and if each image is really corresponding to its file name, we would like to have a script or UI to make Windows pop up just the child folders one by one triggered by pressing enter or a button and close it if a new folder is opened.p  pThanks a lotp

Not defining codedefine GLEWSTATICcode, Glew should link dynamically out of the box. But the undefined error indicates that somehow it is trying to link statically against them.

Negative 1796 pI am trying to make a new game for fun. The game is about guess a number. I used a Microsoft Visual Studio to make an application form. This program will give the user 10 attempts to get a correct guess. It will also tell that the number is too high or low. The program has a loop function to monitor the attempts. If the user guessed at 10 times, the program will stop. The problem is that the display shows the unchanged attempts. For example, the user guessed at five times, but the programs display still shows 10 attempts. It is same thing with stopping the program if the user used 10 attempts. The program should stop after 10 attempts but it is not working. I cannot find where the problem comes from. If anyone could help out with it would be greatly appreciated.p  precodepublic class Main  Form      int randomNumber     int count      private void Form1Loadobject sender, EventArgs e              count  10         randomNumber  generateRandomNumber           private void button1Clickobject sender, EventArgs e                int guess  0         guess  Convert.ToInt32textBox1.Text          for int i  1 i lt count i                      label4.Text  Guess Attempt   i              if guess  randomNumber                              label4.Text  Your guess is correct Game Won                 label2.Visible  false                 label3.Visible  false                 button1.Visible  false                 if MessageBox.ShowDo you want to play again, Start a new game, MessageBoxButtons.YesNo, MessageBoxIcon.Information  DialogResult.Yes                                      Application.Restart                                  else                                      Application.Exit                                   break                          else                  if guess lt randomNumber                                      label2.Text  Too low                                   else if guess gt randomNumber                                      label2.Text  Too high                                    else if i  count                                      label2.Text  Sorry, You missed it Game Lost                     label3.Text  The answer is   randomNumber                     if MessageBox.ShowDo you want to play again, Start a new game, MessageBoxButtons.YesNo, MessageBoxIcon.Information  DialogResult.Yes                                      Application.Restart                                  else                                      Application.Exit                                                       private int generateRandomNumber              Random number  new Random         int randomNumber  number.Next1, 100          return randomNumber      codepre
Negative 1796 pI have a question about associative array Im not able to solve by myself with my lack of programming knowledge.p  pI have a foreach loop from number 1 to 12. For each number I get a link that extract data from another server.p  pThis data has the form of a json array, so I create single arrays for each keyvalue type I extract from json data ex. employer name employer id employer salary ... with CURL.p  pThan I need to insert all this data into a database so I create one array with all this data and than I insert all this data into table. But... if I have to create the final single array from the first foreach I have no problems, but Im not able to continue the already existing final array from the second foreach to the last...

Negative 1796 pIt seems to me Jackson JDK8 Data Type module occasionally ignores Parameter Names module which seems a little bit surprising, given that both demand JDK8 and solve specificuse cases with regards to JDK8. p  pThe issue here is that I could not find a way to make JSON deserialization work without parameter names specified explicitly which is what Parameter Names module is supposed to be all about.
