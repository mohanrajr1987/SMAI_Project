Positive 7715 pIm using R 3.1.2 on Fedora 20 and having trouble with large blank areas at the top and bottom of maps produced by ggplot when coordequal is used.

The trouble is that the plot area does not change, so in effect what you get are large blank regions on the top and bottom of the plot. Using parmar has no effect, since these arent margins, but obviously if the plot is included in a document theyll look like huge, unnecessary margins.p  pAre there options I can use that would prevent these blank regions from appearing or trim them after the fact I should say that this is just a minimal example. In real life the map is more complex, and has to be generated on the fly. That said, the coordinates and dimensions of the panel should not change, so a possible hack would be to generate the image, then clip out the part I need. Still, much better if such things could be avoided.p  pThanksp

While this is reasonably fast, Ive often wondered about how to optimize this.p  pOne idea, for example, would be to precompute at iteration N the zones that emcouldem be modified at iteration N1 so that if a cell does not belong to such a zone, it wont even be considered for modification at iteration N1.

Negative 7715 pIm having some trouble importing and accessing a private key with the ASPNET user. I know that when one imports a private key .pfx file manually, in windows, you get an option to mark the key as exportable. Now, as far as I can tell, this is needed in order to retrieve that private key later on.p  pMy problem comes in that Im importing the private key in code, as the ASPNET user, and there doesnt seem to be a way to mark it as exportable, in the way that the windows certificate import wizard does. To clarify, the import works just fine, but when I access the details on the nowimported certificate, there is no private key data.p  pThis is the code Im using to import the certificate, once I have already opened the .pfx file, with the correct password.p  precodepublic void ImportCertificateX509Certificate2 cert, StoreName name, StoreLocation loc      X509Store certStore  new X509Storename, loc     StorePermission permission  new StorePermissionPermissionState.Unrestricted     permission.Flags  StorePermissionFlags.AddToStore     permission.Assert     certStore.OpenOpenFlags.ReadWrite     certStore.Addcert     certStore.Close  codepre  pAm I mucking up the permissions or the way I import this private key Or am I going about this the wrong way entirelyp

Negative 7715 pI work on a somewhat large web application, and the backend is mostly in PHP. There are several places in the code where I need to complete some task, but I dont want to make the user wait for the result. For example, when creating a new account, I need to send them a welcome email. But when they hit the Finish Registration button, I dont want to make them wait until the email is actually sent, I just want to start the process, and return a message to the user right away.p  pUp until now, in some places Ive been using what feels like a hack with exec. Basically doing things likep  precodeexecdoTask.php arg1 arg2 arg3 gtdevnull 2gtamp1 amp codepre  pWhich appears to work, but Im wondering if theres a better way. Im considering writing a system which queues up tasks in a MySQL table, and a separate longrunning PHP script that queries that table once a second, and executes any new tasks it finds. This would also have the advantage of letting me split the tasks among several worker machines in the future if I needed to.p  pAm I reinventing the wheel Is there a better solution than the exec hack or the MySQL queuep
Negative 7715 pIve noticed that very simple distributed transactions take a good amount of time 34s to complete on a first run.  But if the same transaction scope is called again, its much faster 30ms.  It seems like MSDTC sort of goes to sleep after an hour.  After the hour has passed, the next transaction to run will take 34s.p  pI dont expect much traffic on the site, so its likely that many hours could pass between individual transactions. p  pI thought possibly this was due to the MSDTC service being set to start manually, but Ive made sure that the MSDTC services are both running automatically.p  pGuessing theres a registry setting somewhere, but I had no luck finding anything in MSDN.p  pThank youp

Negative 7715 pI have a WCF service that posts messages to a private, nontransactional MSMQ queue. I have another WCF service multithreaded that processes the MSMQ messages and inserts them in the database. p  pMy issue is with sequencing. I want the messages to be in certain order. For example MSGA need to go to the database before MSGB is inserted. So my current solution for that is very crude and expensive from database perspective.p  pI am reading the message, if its MSGB and there is no MSGA in the database, I throw it back on the message queue and I keep doing that till MSGA is inserted in the database. But this is a very expensive operation as it involves table scan SELECT stmt.p  pThe messages are always posted to the queue in sequence. p  pShort of making my WCF Queue Processing service Single threaded By setting the service behavior attribute InstanceContextMode to Single, can someone suggest a better solutionp  pThanksp  pDanp
Negative 7715 pTwo of our apps are web applications with a Flex 3 front end and a SOAPstyle WCF back end.  To communicate with the back end, I generate web service client classes through Flex Builder 3.  Everythings functional, but maintaining those generated classes has been quite annoying, and Im looking for a better way to do things without having to do a major rewrite, of course.  Heres the problemsp  ol liI use Flex libraries to manage components shared among applications.  Some of them are dependent on the generated classes, so I need the WSDLgenerated classes in their own library.  Flex Builder 3, however, only generates the classes for a Flex emapplicationem, so I have to generate the files in the applications source tree, then manually move the files every time.   This also introduces strange sideeffects with the way that Eclipse manages source code why cant it just monitor the FS like other IDEs do.li liWe use data binding in the MXML to declaratively tie data to the UI.  I emlikeem data binding.  Unfortunately, the classes in the WSDLgenerated code do not support binding.  Therefore, I opted to create a program to alter the ActionScript classes, adding [Bindable] metadata to them.  This has to be run every time we regenerate the code.li liFlex has a very nasty bug, known about at least since March, which still hasnt been fixed a hrefhttpbugs.adobe.comjirabrowseSDK19811 relnofollowhttpbugs.adobe.comjirabrowseSDK19811a.  I recently discovered this, because it was doubleencoding some XML characters like lt and amp into lt and amp.  Therefore, I also had to add a workaround for that to the ActionScript manipulation program.li liThe WSDLcode generator in Flex Builder creates a String, Boolean, Int, and other classes strongwhich are builtin typesstrong  Were always having to delete these source files to prevent the Flex compiler from sometimes balking.li ol  pIt seems unlikely to me that everyone is just putting up with these issues.  There must be some alternative way of generating web service proxy classes for Flex that others are employing.  Since Im timeprohibited from making the communication layer RESTful and rewriting the front end in Silverlight, what do you suggestp

Negative 7715 pIve just graduated from school with a CS degree, and before getting a job, Im trying to teach myself as much as possible.  A large problem Im having is that I have few people to talk to about my code, and really improving the way I write programs.  I figure the best way to do this is to see other peoples code, and to see different ways to write programs, and to see what I can learn from more experienced programmers.  Is there a good website that will allow me to see full programsprojects that others have written  In your guys experience is there a good place to go about doing thisp

Negative 7715 pI am writing a small .NET Windows Forms app, and I use the builtin Visual Studio settings to manage my programs config. I noticed an issue however that after I had added a StringCollection setting to store a list of recently accessed documents, my program took eversoslightly longer to startup. p  pI ran a StopWatch over the programs initialisation and found that even calling StringCollection at all took the startup time from 100 milliseconds to 300 milliseconds. I know likely what youll say, whats 200 milliseconds between friends, but it seems strange to me that something so simple could cause such a delay.p  pSo my question is, why is calling a StringCollection from the settings so slow, and is there any way I can avoid this delayp

Negative 7715 pI have been asked to build a tabbed section on pages that have RESTful URLs without a trailing slash .NET MVC, for example a hrefhttpmyhostbookstheamberspyglasshttpmyhostbookstheamberspyglassa p  pFor the tabbed sections to be a bit more user friendly I want them to remember which tab was open on each page as the user moves around, so that if they return to a book they were previously on the same tab remains opened. This is achieved by setting a cookie named tab with value set to the tabid and path set to the page they are on so it doesnt affect tabs on other pages. So far pretty basic stuff youd think, and it does work quite nicely too. p  pEnter Internet Explorer. p  pIn IE it turns out a cookie with path bookstheamberspyglass will NOT match the above URL and consequently wont get set properly. If I add a trailing slash so the path is bookstheamberspyglass instead it works fine  but I cannot change our URL schema, and even if I could theamberspyglass is a resource, NOT a folder. p  pDoes anyone have a recommended solution to this, surely exceedingly common, problem p  pMany thanks in advance, p  pJSp

Negative 7715 pIm trying to retrieve a Google Calendar event using the Zend Gdata library.p  pWhen I create an event I store in my database the event URL returned by the insertevent method. Initially I thought I could just use this URL to then delete the event later on. After a little research I realized that you actually need a special URL which is the event URL with an extra string of numbers appended to it. I looked at the various event retrieval methods in the Zend Gdata library but none of them seem to allow you to just pass the event URL in. They all seem to want a text or date range query. How would I go about retrieving the delete URL for an event whose URL I already knowp

Negative 7715 pI will jump right in, to be brief and descriptivep  pC, Windows APIp  pI am creating child processes using codeCreateProcesscode to run external commandline applications. I have built in a timeout, and if the child process has not returned normal execution by that time, I wish to force termination on that child process. p  pIdeally, I would like for that child process to act the same as if it had called codeExitProcesscode, or as if a codeCtrlCcode was sent to its console which calls codeExitProcesscode from the default console control handler.p  pMy solution so far has been the use of codeTerminateProcesscode to kill the child forcefully. This does force the child to terminate immediately, but unfortunately if that child spawned any children of its own they are left to run until their natural completion.p  pIs there a way to tell the child process to call codeExitProcesscode, or to force all of the childs children to also terminate when codeTerminateProcesscode is calledp  pThese external applications are beyond my control, and as such I can not modify them to provide a custom workaround.p  pAssume no knowledge of grandchild processes namespidsetc that would allow me to manually call codeTerminateProcesscode on grandchild processes individually.

Even though we have the solution, we still have to work out the fine details, for example what fields will be needed for the News amp Events items, or What types of user roles can access X content.p  pI know in a perfect world you would write out all of the functional requirements before defining a solution, but with smaller projects the client rarely cares about the granular details, and we use the functional specifications to prevent scope creep and also make sure we are all aware of the requirements for the final product.p  pSo the question is is it okay to incorporate the solution into the functional specifications document if it has already been defined or specified either internally or by the client If so, do you only define the requirements specifically required by the client, and leave out existing functionality in the system Theme Management, Settings Panels, etcp  pThanksp

Negative 7715 pIm having an annoying issue with Android development. I have a webserver Tomcat running on my Macbook which is connected to the local network via wifi. I have my Sprint EVO connected to the same network using wifi. The only way I can connect to the Tomcat instance is by raw IP address. If I use the Macbook name with or without the .local domain suffix it does not recognize the host name. The emulator behaves the same way. My iPhone can resolve the host name as can the iPhone simulator. So, Im thinking either this is a bug in the Android platform or Ive missedaccidentally tweak some hidden config somewhere in both the emulator and the device Any ideap

This occurs only on the device and not in the simulator annoyingly  this seems to be related to wait for vsync blocking on the main thread amp the way the app runloop process touch input amp eats messagesli liwhen using the next most recommended system NSTimer I noted that certain touch inputs are dropped once the CPU load reaches a certain point in the simulator but not in the device also annoyingly. NSTimer also results in much lower precision on when my updates fireli liwhen using the least recommended system running the run loop in its own thread managed internally with a highprecision timer built from machabsolutetime, all my touch input problems go away, however my ASSERT code now traps in the wrong thread and only if I usleep following the software interrupt. My assert code is similar to a hrefhttpiphone.m20.nlwpp1httpiphone.m20.nlwpp1a I really like having my assert code trap immediately at the line that caused the problem, so this solution is not really workable for me harder to debug.li ulli liSecond, lost time ul liwhile investigating the system, I found that regardless of framerate bizarrely, but I suppose statistically it still makes sense wvsync Im waiting approximately 22 of the time on the vsync. Ive confirmed this by moving around glFlushglFinish and by playing with how often I do the presentRenderBuffer calls. This is key time that Id love to be processing AI, etc rather than simply stalling on a blocking gl call. The only way I can think of around this would involve moving rendering into its own thread, but Im not sure if its warranted to start rearchitecting for multithreading on a singleprocessor device.li ulli ul  pSo has anyone found a magic bullet around these issues Does anyone have a killer runloop architecture thats kickass on this platform At the moment it looks like I have to pick the lesser of the evils.p

Negative 7715 p[Note After Answer I am actually querying in memoryobjects and thats why codeToTraceStringcode doesnt work. I added this to save the reader potential time from reading my long post].p  pIm using a codeToTraceStringcode command when trying to inspect how my LINQ queries end up looking. However, today my query got a bit complicated, involving a codejoincode and all of the sudden, I get this error when I try to Trace my Stringp  pUnable to cast object of type d7a1[EGSLanguageProviderShared.DTODataType] to type System.Data.Objects.ObjectQuery.p  pMy Query, and subsequent invocation of codeToTraceStringcode is as follows note that System.Data.Entity has to be referenced in order for this to work. Both objects Im querying langDTs and langInstructionsAVDTs are Entity Framework .Net 3.5 objects from the same database. My Where Clause  av.InstructionAVKey uses a simple Value Collection Class, nothing to see there.p  precode      IEnumerableltDTODataTypegt dts             from langDT in langDTs            join langIAVDT in langInstructionsAVDTs            on langDT.DataTypeKey equals langIAVDT.DataTypeKey            where langIAVDT.InstructionAVKey  av.InstructionAVKey            select langDT.Distinct       var sql  System.Data.Objects.ObjectQuerydts.ToTraceString codepre  pAny ideas on how I could see the LINQ translation of this Join  . I noticed that System.Data.Objects has more types of queries, but I cant get any of the ones which seem more relevant to this case, to work.p  pstrongLATER EDITstrongp  pAs you recommended, I tried changing the IEnumerable to an IQueryable but that resulted in a type incompatibility compilation error  .p  pAfter doing an explicit cast, I got the same error, but at Runtime codeUnable to cast object of type ltDistinctIteratorgtd7a1[EGSLanguageProviderShared.DTODataType] to type System.Linq.IQueryablecode1[EGSLanguageProviderShared.DTODataType].p  pAdditional code my objects langDTs and langInstructionsAVDTs arep  precodeListltDTOInstructionActiveValueDataTypegt langInstructionsAVDTs  CurrentLPInstructionManager.GetInstructionsActiveValuesDataTypesfrom avKey in langInstructionsAVs select avKey.InstructionAVKey.Distinct.ToArray  ListltDTODataTypegt langDTs  LPDataTypeManager.GetDataTypesfrom dt in langInstructionsAVDTs orderby dt.DataTypeKey select dt.DataTypeKey.Distinct.ToArray codepre  pSo these objects are indeed queried immediately because they are Lists  . As for DTODataType and DTOInstructionActiveValueDataType, they are simple Value Collection Classes, just public Properties, thats all. p  pstrongEVEN LATER EDITstrongp  pMight be of interest that at their root, the objects Im using are indeed declared as ObjectQuery back in the deepest layer Entity Frameworkp  precodepublic globalSystem.Data.Objects.ObjectQueryltinstructionsgt instructions codepre  pHowever, as I bring the data from over the Data Access Layer, I am converting them to Data Transfer Objects the DTOprefixed classes you keep seeing, which are simple Value Collection Classes a propertybyproperty map of the Entity Objects which I use in order to keep the Data Model completely separated from the View and also to execute any data postprocessing in the Presentation side.p

On ButtonClick I call the method drawQRImage, which will return a UIImage. B. Inside drawQRImage I open a PNGFile, until now it has the size 210x210 and only a white background. Nothing else. I then manipulate some of the pixels on it and paint them black. The current Code should set pixel nr. 11 black. When finished I return the newly created image. C. The method buttonClicked will then show this Image inside the UIImageView.p  pAll in all actually very simple. It also works nearly perfectly. But now I want to make some modifications, but can not get them working until nowp  ol lipThe image I have to return is not always 210x210 pixels, so I have to be able to change the size. Loading a blank PNGFile and manipulating its pixels was the only workaround until now I managed to get working. A more elegant way would be creating a blank Image with white BG of desired size I could use in my current method. Unfortunately I didnt find anything on that subject yet. Only on manipulating pixels on allready existing Images. Thats how I came up with the current workaround. I allready tried the snipped for resizing from the following Link a hrefhttpvocaro.comtrevorblog20091012resizeauiimagetherightwayResizing a UIImage the right wayapli lipThe button can be clicked several times, the painted pixels will also change. My problem now is, that I seem to have a memory leak because I commented out the linep  pCGImageReleaseimageRefpli ol  pBut if I do release the UIImageRef imageRef, I will get a EXCBADACCESSError when clicking the button again. So I know this means that I try accessing an object that allready has been released. But how can I solve this problem, I am not sure if I got everything right here. I thought the imageRef will be created newly at the beginning of method drawQRImage and hence releasing it should not be a problem when I call the method another time. But looks like I seem to be wrong.p  pEvery bit of help is appreciatedp

This class has a property codeAccountcode, which is a codeServiceAccountcode enumeration with possible values LocalService, LocalSystem, NetworkService and User.p  pThis is fine at installtime, but does anybody know how I can change this value for an existing servicep  pI assuming that I need to move away from the actual installtype classes, and have been researching hooking into the advapi32 ChangeServiceConfig method, WMI and ManagementObjects etc. p  pIndeed I have found code which will actually change the account under which the service runs, p  precodeManagementObject mo  new ManagementObjectWin32Service.Name  myService   object[] configParams  new object[11]  configParams[6]  userName configParams[7]  password  object result  mo.InvokeMethodChange, configParams codepre  pwhich on its own looks a bit like black magic but makes sense when viewed with the ChangeServiceConfig signaturep  pHowever when I apply this code to a service which happens to be installed as LocalSystem, it has no effect although when I interpret coderesultcode the call is reporting success. This doesnt really surprise me since I am only setting a username and password, I am not saying rather than running as a local service, this service needs to run under a specific user account.p  pNow, my gut feel is that I am heading along the right lines here. The problem is that none of the parameters in ChangeServiceConfig appear to offer the opportunity to do this.p  pAny ideas TIA, Petep

Negative 7715 pIt seems that when using two jquery UI droppables that touch each other, the droppable events are not fired correctly.  If, while dragging a draggable from over one of the elements to emjustem below it onto the next element, then the out event is fired for the first droppable, but the over event is not fired for the second.  If you drop at this point, no drop event is fired.p  pAn example is best.  Try a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netvwLhD5 relnofollowthis fiddlea tested in IE7,8,9 and Chrome11.  Make sure your browsers console log is open.  If you drag the draggable over the first row, then slowly drag towards the second row, youll soon see in the log that the out event for the first row is fired, but the over event for the second row is not.  If you drop when this happens, the drop event is not fired.p  pIt seems to just be a 1 pixel line in between the rows that causes the problem.  Dragging one more pixel causes the over event to be fired, and the drop event to work correctly.p  pThis looks like a bug to me, but I cant find anyone else who has used table rows as droppables and has reported the problem.  I styled the table so you can see that the rows are indeed flush together with no space in between.p  pThis is a big problem for me because in our app, the table rows are nested greedy droppables.  So if the user drops when this happens, the drop is actually picked up by the outer droppable instead.p  pAlso, we give feedback to the user in the draggable helper in the form of an icon and message that changes depending on the droppable you are over.  When you drag between rows, it flickers for a moment, as it thinks you are not over any droppable when you actually are.p  pMy questionsp  ol liIs there any fix or workaround for this issueli liShould I report this as a bugli ol  h2Updateh2  pdavin,p  pWe did end up changing the drag function in .ui.ddmanager to fix the event ordering.  Our issue was we have nested greedy droppables.  When you moved from one of these nested droppables to the other from bottom to top, the over event would actually fire for the parent last, causing bad things to happen.p  pSo we added logic to basically check if moving from one nested greedy to another, and if so, not fire parent events.p  pWould it be too much to ask to have you look this over real quick and make sure our logic makes sense  There are two logical changes.

Negative 7715 pWe are green fielding a mobile web app against an existing Java web app the database of that app, at least.p  pWe are only using the database of the original app because the original app is built on a custom ORM solution and Struts 1.1 that is showing its age.  So this is going to be a bit of a proof of concept for what can be done with modern tools.p  pWe have decided to utilize JQuery mobile on the front end to leverage device cross compatibility.  On the back end we are going to go with JPA for now...maybe moving to Hibernate down the road.  But wed like to expose our model with a RESTful service to kill two birds with one stone the original app interfaces with a number of third partys that wed like to give access over a simple REST interface that happens to have a lot of overlap, data wise, with the mobile module.p  pSo, the question is which controller layer will best tie the JQuery mobile front end with the RESTful back endp  pWed like a controller framework thatp  ul liIs not too intrusive.  i.e. we dont have to lock ourselves into that particular implementation because of hard set dependencies spread all over the code.li liIs annotation based or heavy on convention over config. or both so we are not writing reams of XML glueli liDoesnt bring along cruft that we wont be using... i.e. it sticks to the controller layer as much as possibleli liCan handle REST from one end and AJAX from the other without too much troubleli liThe larger the community the betterli liThe simpler to get up an running without compromising any of the other points, the better.li ul  pWeve begun exploring Struts2, SpringMVC, Stripes, Play etc.  but I am hoping for some sage advice from the erudite SO community to help narrow the field.  p  pIf you need anything clarified, I will be happy to do that.p

Negative 7715 pI am creating a custom Java component for the Amazon Kindle KDK based on the Java 1.4.2 Personal Basis Profile. The component will contain text that will reflow to multiple lines if necessary. I want to request a size using codegetMinimumSizecode, codegetPreferredSizecode and codegetMaximumSizecode methods that will contain the text exactly. I will need to request the exact height needed based on how much width the component will receive during layout.p  pFor example, if the component will receive enough width to contain all the text on one line, then it will only request one line worth of height. But if it will only receive enough width to have the text fit on three lines, then it will request a height which will allow for three lines of text.p  pIt seems I need the layout to be done in two passes, the first to request as much width as it needs to fit the text on one line. Then once its received the amount of width it is allowed, to request the amount of height to fit the text on multiple lines if necessary. What is the best way to go about finding out what this width will be in order to return the proper codeDimensioncode in codegetMinimumSizecode, codegetPreferredSizecode and codegetMaximumSizecodep  pEDIT To clarify, Id gladly use a codeJTextAreacode, but the PBP doesnt have any swing and limited AWT components. The Kindle KDK has some basic components itself, including a KTextArea and KLabelMultiline. Problem is both are extremely buggy and dont size themselves properly in flexible layout situations. They work fine with fixed layouts, where everything is given a fixed area to use. But when placing them in a layout that has glue elements and other text components that can have variable sizes, they dont expand properly to display all their text, the problem Im trying to address with a custom component.p

Negative 7715 pIve been dealing with an API recently that requires nodes of the XML document to be in a particular order.

I understand why sending sibling nodes that have the same name in the same order is important as explained a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1131495inxmlisorderimportantin this questiona. However, some nodes can be left outp  precodelttransactiongt     ltamountgt100ltamountgt     ltorderIdgt1234ltorderIdgt lttransactiongt codepre  pSo in the third example, amount and orderId would now be at [0] and [1] instead of at [1] and [2] in the first correct example.p  pAnother thought would be that they process the XML as a string and require that they always know what nodes come after each other, but again since omitting nodes is allowed, that theory doesnt make sense.p  pCan anyone explain to me why the order in which I give nodes matters Or am I just dealing with an API that is old and grumpyp

Negative 7715 pI am writing a clientserver application using TCP Sockets. The server is written in C using Visual Studio 2010 .NET 4.0. The server allows multiple client connections at the same time therefore I am using the Async. style. The server needs to connect to a database MySQL and while the server program is running I need to interact with the database. For this reason I am using a BackgroundWorker to run the infinite listening loop that will Accept Clients in order to prevent the interface from freezing and be able to access the database from the visual interface.p  pEverything is working fine unless when the server program losses focus. Examples of losing focus are the PC that is running the server program starts the screensaver, you click on the clock on the taskbar to see the time, you open another widow windows explorer, calculator.... If the server program looses focus and a client tries to connect, the server closes completely If I am running the server from Visual Studio it does not throw any error or exception. If I am running a released version of the server, Microsoft Windows will show the Programming not responding... dialog.p  pHere is how my code is structuredp  pVariables in the main classp  precodeconst int portNo   12345 static System.Net.IPAddress localAdd  System.Net.IPAddress.Parse192.168.1.67 static TcpListener tcpListenerReadWrite   new TcpListenerlocalAdd, portNo codepre  pIn the main Form a button starts the serverp  precodeprivate void button1Clickobject sender, EventArgs e      tcpListenerReadWrite.Start     backgroundWorker1.RunWorkerAsync  codepre  pThe background worker DoWork functionp  precodeprivate void backgroundWorker1DoWorkobject sender, DoWorkEventArgs e      while true              ChatClient clientRead  new ChatClienttcpListenerReadWrite.AcceptTcpClient       codepre  pIn the Server Class, the constructor is as followsp  precodepublic ChatClientTcpClient client constructor      client  client     clientIP  client.Client.RemoteEndPoint.ToString      start reading data from the client in a separate thread     data  new byte[client.ReceiveBufferSize]     client.GetStream.BeginReaddata, 0, Convert.ToInt32client.ReceiveBufferSize, ReceiveMessage, client  codepre  pWhen a message is received by the serverp  precodepublic void ReceiveMessageIAsyncResult asyncResult      read received message from client  codepre  pTwo final notes 1 when a client connects to the server the first thing it does is sending a message to the server like a Hello message, 2 before writing the server in a visual interface I was testing it in a Console mode and this problem was not existing, the screensaver used to run and nothing happened.

Negative 7715 pIs it possible to catch an exception thrown from one thread in another thread For example, I am spawning a thread from my main thread. The spawned thread may throw uncaught exceptions. Is it possible to have the spawning thread catch these exceptionsp  pOne solution would be to catch the exceptions from the entry point of the spawned thread and handle the exception by posting an codeNSNotificationcode. Then, the spawning thread can listen for these codeNSNotificationcodes.

What I need to know is how the generated code is expected to be different, due to optimizations, changes in structure member alignment and etc.p  pP.S. Its a MSVC 2010 express, for Win32p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIve built several projects using VC10, so now I have some comparison data. Overall I see a significant executable image size increase, about 15 compared to VC9, and 10 even compared to VC8.p  pIm optimizing for speed, not for image size. So that strictly speaking that comparison is not fair. However I remember that VC9 compared to VC8 usually produced a bit smaller images, yet managed to squeeze even more performance. From the performance point of view the new code is pretty close to that of VC9 indistinguishable in my tests.p  pBesides the code quality degradation which I hope is not the case I see the following potential reasons for larger imagesp  ul liMore aggressive overall speed optimizations which lead to an only modest effect, at least in my case, such as aggressive loop unrolling and etc.li liAdditional data in the image due to some new features such as SAFESEH, DEP and etc.li liLarger runtime libraries for whatever reasons Im using them as a static lib, linked into the executableli ul  pDisabling the SAFESEH option which is now on by default decreases the image slightly 1.p  pAny more ideas May this be different if I use nonexpress version of VC10 Does enabling DEP data execution prevention enlarge the image size I guess  nop  pIm compiling with EHa, this reduces optimization strength, but this is also the case with older VC versions.p  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pIve found the causes of the image bloating.p  pUsing dumpbin Ive discovered that surprisingly the EXE built by VC10 contains a strongrelocation tablestrong. This was weird, since EXEs dont usually contain it. And it disappears if the EXE was built with the following in the vcxproj filep  precodeltLinkgt   ltRandomizedBaseAddressgtfalseltRandomizedBaseAddressgt ltLinkgt codepre  pBy default base address randomization is ON in VC10. This option mysteriously makes VC10s linker behave as it builds a DLL, as the result it includes the relocation table.p  pThis reduced the EXE size, but still not to the level of VC9. Then Ive opened the EXE with dependencies walker, and discovered that the EXE built by VC10 imports codeEncodePointercode and codeDecodePointercode from codekernel32.dllcode.p  pAccording to online resources, those functions are imported by the VC10 runtime libraries, by yet another strongsidioticsstrong naive attempt to enhance the software security. Not only the new runtime seems fatter, but this would also prevent the executable from running under Win2K and WinXPSP1.p  pFortunately theres an option to fallback to the older runtime librariesp  precodeltPlatformToolsetgtv90ltPlatformToolsetgt codepre  pAfter it was set  the produced EXE became almost identical to the one built by VC9, including size, import table, sections, safe exception handler table, resources and etc.p  pSo that now its possible to benefit from some of the new features, without sacrificing the code quality.p

Negative 7715 pI am pretty new to the Padrino framework and ruby in general and have been looking into using padrinos builtin support for the LESS CSS preprocessor for a new application I am developing. I decided to fully commit to LESS for this project as I am using Twitters Bootstrap framework as a base for my UI.p  pSo my question is, how do I go about using padrinos LESS support in my workflow, both during development where Id want the .less source files to be compiled on the fly and reloaded on every page refresh, and in production where padrino should be serving a single css file compiled from all the .less source files, which would all be correctly ordered and imported in a master application.less file. p  pI can see that when I generate a padrino project choosing less as the css preprocessor that I get a stylesheets directory in both the app directory, where I assume the .less files should go, as well as the publicstylesheets directory where I assume a compiled .css file would sit. What I am unsure of is how do I define my LESS assests to padrino and how far does its builtin support go, and how much management will I still have to do manually p  pAnd FYI, my development environment is Mac OSX Lion, and the pow rack server. For production I am still deciding on a host, put am leaning towards heroku.p

Negative 7715 pThe active object design pattern as I understand is tying up a privatededicated thread life time with an object and making it work on independent data. From some of the documentation I read , the evolution of this kind of paradigm was because of two reasons , first , managing raw threads would be pain and second more threads contending for the shared resource doesnt scale well using mutex and locks.  while I agree with the first reason , I do not fully comprehend the second . Making an object active just makes the object independent but the problems like contention for lockmutex is still there as we still have shared queuebuffer, the object just delegated the sharing responsibility onto the message queue. The only advantage of this design pattern as i see is the case where I had to perform long asynch task on the shared object now that i am just passing message to a shared queue , the threads no longer have to block for long on mutexlocks but they still will blocka and contend for publishing messagestask. Other than this case could someone tell more scenarios where this kind of design pattern will have other advantages.  p  pThe second question I have is I just started digging around design patterns , what is the conceptual difference  between , active object , reactor and proactor design pattern . How do you decide in which design pattern is more efficient and suits your requirements more. It would be really nice if someone can demonstrate certain examples showing how the three design patterns will behave and which one has comparative advantagedisadvantage in different scenarios.p  pI am kind of confused as I have used active object which used shared threadsafe  buffer  and boostasioProactor both to do similar kind of async stuff  , I would like to know if any one has more insights on applicability of different patterns when approaching a problem.p
Negative 7715 p Edited for clarification and cleaner code.p  pIm trying to accept a character from the keyboard any character and convert its ASCII value to hex, then display it.  p  pI know how to convert from base 10 to hex, but just to make sure Im not using incorrect terminologyp  pIf I enter c in as my ASCII value, its decimal value is 63.  63 divided by 16 hex is base 16  3.9375.  Save the quotient of 3 for later.  Remainder  base .9375  16  15.  15 is Hex character F.  p  pQuotient divided by base 3  16  0.1875.  Quotient is zero, so this is the last step in conversion.  Remainder  base .1875  16  3p  pRead them from last to first first in, last out, if thinking about the stack, and I get 3F as the Hex value for the decimal number 63 which is ASCII for cp  pThis is correct, yesp  pIts pretty simple to read, I hope.  I just get the character from the keyboard AL, set BX as the divisor base 16, and then divide AL by BX, store the remainder in the stack, and later on loop through the stack and try to display it...p  pI think my problem is that something is wrong with my multiplication and with my INT 21H02H.  Im not sure if I need to add 30h in order to display the character or not...p  pOn top of that, Im not even sure if I need to be at that point displaying yet anyway, because I still havent figured out how to convert 1015 to AF for hex.  p  pI tried speaking with my teacher, and after waiting 30 minutes for him to finish speaking to another gaggle of students in my class about something from another one of his classes, and not this one...which irked me quite a bit, the most that I got was start over.  p  pWhen asked about what about using SHR and SHL as it was pointed out to me, but I was told that it can be done without that, and that I cant use those commands they havent been covered in the class.p  pAny input on what Im doing wrong  Thanksp  precode    CHAR2HEX PROC                    Accept a character, print its ascii value in hex.

Negative 7715 pI have a media player app that is playing music with MPMoviePlayerController. I need to update the UI based on the playback position.

Negative 7715 pI have a function within a large project of the form given below func is called 5 times within the call hierarchy in some Abc class p  precode void Testfuncstdstring c          coutltltc   codepre  pThe function func is called by some functions in a large hierarchy. But all that the function func does is printing a string. Now instead of printing the string I want to store its output somewherein vector form so that I may use it later in the program at the point where the hierarchy of func begins. I am completely clueless as to how should I capture this output instead of printing it.

Negative 7715 pI am working on a project which requires to find how much a new image has shifted and rotated w.r.t the old image. I am trying to implement it using fft. However, it works for some cases and fails for others. The steps i follow arep  ol litake the two images, implement canny edge detectionli lifind out the shift using fft and remove the shiftli litransform the image to polar domain and find the shift and convert the answer to radiansli ol  pIn some cases, I get the correct answer but in other cases I get shift as 0,0 and rotation as 0 radians. Please suggest the reason why this may happen.p  pHere is the codep  precodeclass Register              Class for registering images based on FFT. The usage is as follows         gtgtgt im0  imreadimage0.jpg, flatten  True         gtgtgt im1  imreadimage1.jpg, flatten  True         gtgtgt reg  Registerim0, im1         gtgtgt shift  reg.shift         gtgtgt rotation  reg.theta          Note             1. This image registration technique is not very reliable and                is valid only for small rotation             2.

Negative 7715 pI have eclipse and intellij from the same workspace because both replies on pom.xml file. I notice something different.

If some of the projects are not open it will look at jar files from .m2 folder which is fine. So, when I change something I could just compile the file and see the changes without restarting the server. p  pHowever, in Intellij CE when I run jettyrun from maven it only looks at .m2 folder for the jar files, so I had to codemvn clean installcode every time to update .m2 folder and restart the server.

Anyone has a solutionp  pA way to detect the ratio of the images and then resize only if heightwidthp  pThanksp

Negative 7715 pI have a large image that I load into a UIImageView. The image is a PNG and its 2x file size is 384K. The image is 5119x2413 pixels. The image can be zoomed by the user by using pinch gestures.

The apps live bytes generally hovers around 4MB when using the app, but as soon as you view the screen containing the UIImageView this shoots up to 40MB Onces the image is on the screen the memory returns to around 4MB.p  pThe problem Im having is that more times than not on older devices and ones limited by memory like the iPod Touch my app is being terminated by the system, along with some system services like SpringBoard.p  pIve tried using code[UIImage imageWithContentsOfFile]code instead of code[UIImage imageNamed]code to load the image as I am aware that code[UIImage imageNamed]code caches the image but this has had no effect.p  pIt seems that the spike in live memory caused when attempting to display the image for the first time is causing a low memory situation and the app is being terminated by the OS.p  pIm curious to how I can fix this, and how Apple are dealing with loading large images in the Photos app.p  pJust for the record Im using ARC and iOS 5.1.1 with XCode 4.4.1.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsKQ9g.jpg altenter image description herep

Some content is sensitive so security is reasonably important if any of the enclosed audio files made the rounds around the internet, it could be catastrophic for our business.p  pI am currently prototyping the service and MP3s are stored on S3 and they are not secured. Its time to secure them. From my research, I understand that I can, in fact, secure files on S3 with an access expiry period. But, because I have many users, signing the request with my global key and have an expiry probably isnt a good idea because p  ol liIf I need to revoke access, Ill need to do it for everyoneli liSince I dont know when, exactly, their podcatcher will request the file, I dont know when to set the expiry.  Sometimes, the podcatcher downloads the feed XML, but only later fetches the MP3 file so the URLs could expire before the client has a chance to fetch them Im thinking about iTunes, but there could be others.li ol  pThe way I see it, I have two options and Im not sure if either are workablep  pstrongEditstrong Another potential way, I suppose, would be to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2636783djangoass3proxyrole my own security, and simply redirecta to an MP3 on S3 with a short expiry if the user is good to go.

Everyones MP3 urls are signed with their secret token and expiry a long time from now. I dont like the idea of storing their tokens on my database, and Im not sure if the Amazon ACL was designed for this scenario. It also means the files can still be shared if you know the URL.li liI can proxy every request through my server. This means I only have one Amazon account, and I can role my own security system. But proxying every MP3 download through my server sounds slow, wasteful and expensive.li ol  pAny ideas on the best way to do this. p  pP.S. Im not married to S3. Other solutions could be considered.

Ideally, I would like to try using the newish codeNSOrderedSetcode to model the relationship as ordered, to see if there is a performance benefit.

I would only consider this if keeping all three properties in line with each other could be automatic  perhaps by tweaking how the codeNSManagedObjectcode adddeletesupdates its Books. For example, I would like to somehow customize codeauthor.addBookcode to also insert the same book in the correct location into codeauthor.booksByDatecode and codeauthor.booksByTitlecode.

Negative 7715 pIs there a way to tell if an iOS app enters the foreground from fastapp switching or manually I need to know by the time applicationWillEnterForeground is called, so some specific code can be executed or not executed depending on the condition in which the app entered the foreground.p  pEDIT It turned out that this was more of a design issue for me. I moved my code to applicationDidBecomeActive. I also added a BOOL property to the appDelegate called fastAppSwitching probably the wrong name for it. I set this to YES in applicationhandleOpenURL and applicationopenURLsourceApplicationannotation. Then I added the following code to applicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptionsp  precode        if launchOptions              self.fastAppSwitching  YES                  else              self.fastAppSwitching  NO          codepre  pIn applicationDidBecomeActive, I used the following codep  precode    if fastAppSwitching  YES          self.fastAppSwitching  NO stop, dont go any further          else         ...      codepre  pEDIT2 MaxGabriel makes a good point below Just a warning to others taking the solution described here, applicationDidBecomeActive is called when the user e.g. ignores a phone call or text message, unlike applicationWillEnterForeground. This is actually also true for inapp purchases and Facebook inapp authorization new in iOS 6. So, with some further testing, this is the current solutionp  pAdd a new Bool called passedThroughWillEnterForeground.p  pIn applicationWillResignActivep  precodeself.passedThroughWillEnterForeground  NO codepre  pIn applicationDidEnterBackgroundp  precodeself.passedThroughWillEnterForeground  NO codepre  pIn applicationWillEnterForegroundp  precodeself.passedThroughWillEnterForeground  YES codepre  pIn applicationDidBecomeActivep  precode    if passedThroughWillEnterForeground          we are NOT returning from 6.0 inapp authorization dialog or inapp purchase dialog, etc         do nothing with this BOOL  just reset it         self.passedThroughWillEnterForeground  NO          else          we ARE returning from 6.0 inapp authorization dialog or inapp purchase dialog  IE         This is the same as fastapp switching in our book, so lets keep it simple and use this to set that         self.fastAppSwitching  YES           if fastAppSwitching  YES           self.fastAppSwitching  NO          else          ...      codepre  pEDIT3 I think we also need a bool to tell if app was launched from terminated.p

So it seems to be safe for javac and imho conceptually right to compare any codeFooltAgtcode and codeFooltBgtcode. But it is still not possible to write a generic method codeasSortedListcode which returns a sorted list representation for a generic collection, if its type argument is parametrized with a wildcard. I tried to trick javac by substituting codeFooltgtcode by codeS extends ComparableltSgtcode in codeasSortedFooListcode, but this didnt work.p  pstrongEDIT3strong Later a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma13543272691083Rafaellea pointed out, that there is a flaw in the design, since implementing codeComparableltFooltTgtgtcode is not necessary, and implementing codeComparableltFooltgtgtcode provides the same functionality, solving the initial problem by refined design.p  pThe initial reason and benefit was, that a codeFooltTgtcode may not care emin some purposesem about its concrete type but still use an instance of a concrete type codeTcode, it is instantiated with, for other purposes. That instance does not have to be used for determining the order among other codeFoocodes, as it may be used in other parts of the API.p  pConcrete example Assume each Foo is instantiated with a different type argument for codeTcode. Every instance of codeFooltTgtcode has an incrementing id of type codeintcode which is used in the implementation of the codecompareTocodemethod.  We can now sort a list of these differently typed codeFoocode and dont care about the concrete type codeTcode expressing it with codeFooltgtcode and emstillem have an instance of a concrete type codeTcode accessible for later processing.p

Negative 7715 pI have a a hrefhttpsgithub.comtheorydistzillalocaletextdomain relnofollowPerl modulea that handles localization tasks using the GNU gettext utilities codexgettextcode, codemsgfmtcode, codemsginitcode, and codemsgmergecode. I got some test failures from a SunOS system which, when I looked into it, seemed to be ancient. For now I am skipping tests when codemsgfmtcode and codexgettextcode choke on a simple codeversioncode option. But I think it would be better to refuse to install unless a relatively modern version of the GNU Gettext utilities are installed.p  pSo, whats the best way to do that Id like to just figure out whats installed and if it supports the options I need, and refuse to install the module if those dependencies are not met.

Negative 7715 pIve created a Java application that is basically an interface to a MySQL database. It helps organize and keep track of data.  We are using it in my workplace with no problem  I have exported it from Eclipse as a jar file and given everyone a copy of this jar file.p  pNow we want to make this software available to other workplaces.  The problem is that the URL, username, and password for the database are hardcoded in the application.  I want to create a setup process for it so that when someone downloads it, they go through a wizard that downloads MySQL and sets up the database wherever they choose.  The person can then distribute the jar file to everyone in their workplace without them having to do the setup, because everyone will be accessing the same database.p  pThis process must save the database URL, username, and password somehow so that the people in the workplace can run the jar from whatever computer.  This makes me think that they should be saved inside the jar... is a Properties file that I need  Can I put a Properties file inside the jar and allow it to be edited during the setup processp  pAny guidance is greatly appreciated, Im very new to thisp  pp  pEDIT I think what Im going to do now is let the user install MySQL and set up their database themself.  As the answers below suggested, having this automatic might be more trouble than its worth, as I would have to deal with everyones different platforms, preferences for setting up the database, security concerns, etc. Once they do this, they will just download my jar file.p  pIve added a properties file to my jar file to store the database URL, username, and password.  This file is initially empty, so when the user runs the jar for the first time, the program will attempt to access the properties file, see that its empty, and prompt the user to enter this information.  It will then extract the properties file from the jar, edit in their information, and stick the properties file back into the jar.  Then, the person should be able to distribute the updated jar to their coworkers and they should all be able to open it without having to supply that information.  Ive got this part almost working.  Im also going to add the ability to reconfigure the program  in case the user moves their database  by calling the same method they would again have to distribute the new version of the program.p  pNext I want to try securing the properties file somehow by encrypting it or obfuscating the code although I think that only works for class files and not text files....  My concern is that anyone in the workplace can unjar it and open the properties file, then use the URL, username, and password to access the database on their own and cause damage.

For security purposes, this type will not be serialized. codepre  pIt seems that emwriteObjectem cannot serialize the object of type Foo because the Foo class does not belong to the whitelisted items, even though custom serializers have been provided for both the client and the server.p  pI could always skip the emwriteObjectem invocation and call emwriteIntem amp emwriteStringem for each Foos data members which is working well but I would much rather get emwriteObjectem to work. The solution that I proposed is emhighlyem prone to maintenance mistakes as any changes in the Foo class in the future have to be reflected on both the Foos serializers obvious and Bars serializers not so obvious.p  pI have tried pretty much anything I could find on the net, from implementing the emisSerializableem interface on both Foo and Bar didnt make any difference and it shouldnt make any difference since AFAIK classes that supply their own custom serializers do not need to adhere to this rule and even supplying a private zeroargs constructors which should also not make any difference as the instantiation functions of the custom field serializer should take care of that through the static factories.p  pWhy is the Foo class not whitelisted Have I missed something obvious or have misinterpreted somethingp  pThank you for your time in advance.p

Negative 7715 pSo Im having an intense amount of trouble trying to debug a wcf service, and could use some help.

Im using WCFTestClient to connect to the service when i debug it locally. Whenever I first open up visual studio and debug the service in question it works fine, but if I make changes to the code and need to rebuild, Im getting the following errorp  blockquote   pUnable to copy file objDebugApplication.DataAccess.dll to   binDebugApplication.DataAccess.dll. The requested operation cannot   be performed on a file with a usermapped section open.p blockquote  pThe only way Ive been able to work around this issue is to close visual studio and reopen it, which is rather time consuming and annoying to do every time I make a change. Ive tried cleaning the solution and rebuilding, but I get the same error. Ive even opened up Process Explorer to try and find whats using the dll, but the only thing is FxCopCmd.exe which is part of visual studio.p  pDoes anyone have a better way of debugging wcf services locally, or have an idea of how to prevent or resolve the above error Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks.p

Negative 7715 pI am developing a pagination on a collection in mongodb using combination of skip and limit. in the express get route, i get params as page2 or page3 and so on. When its on page 2, i skip 10 records, on 3 20 records and so on.p  pBut as per the mongodb documentationp  precodeThe cursor.skip method is often expensive because it requires the server to walk from the beginning of the collection or index to get the offset or skip position before beginning to return result. As offset e.g. pageNumber above increases, cursor.skip will become slower and more CPU intensive. With larger collections, cursor.skip may become IO bound. codepre  pNow this bothers me. It suggests range based navigation, but how do i actually do it in my case where i just get the page numbers. and how does it prevents this process to become IO boundp  pAny detailedexplained answerp
Negative 7715 pIv made a VBA Sub that loops into values in a namerange and compares them with values in a column on my main worksheet. If he finds one, result in another cell will be value he just compared AND result in another cell will add 60 pointsp  pAll this works, only i work with 2 subs, 2 nameranges. I need this bacause the other namerange contains other values and if he finds one of them, the value in the other cell will be 40 points only.p  pAnyway i have a problem doing this, because in my first name range i have a value ANY And in my other namerange i have a value Anywhere. If in my main worksheet there is a cell containing Anywhere, my first Loopsub activates, because he found Any. Also my other loopsub will activate, means i get a result of 6040, and it should only be 40.p  pIt was hard to explain, i hope you guys understand my problem.

Negative 7715 pIve gotten IAB v3 working and I was able to make a purchase for a managed item. However, to continue developing and testing I wanted to refund the purchase so I could try making the same purchase again. I logged into my Google Checkout Merchant account and successfully refunded the purchase. However, the app still thinks that the user has the item purchased. It has already been several weeks since I made the refund so its not a delay issue. p  pBasically, in my codeQueryInventoryFinishedListenercode implementation, codeinventory.hasPurchaseSKUREMOVEADScode always returns true, even after the refund codeSKUREMOVEADScode is the SKU for item Im selling. I was expecting it to return false after the refund had been processed.p  pIf you look at the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comgoogleplaybillingbillingadmin.htmlbillingrefundsHandling Refunds section of the IAB referencea, it says that your app needs to be listening to the INAPPNOTIFY messages. However the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comgoogleplaybillingv2api.htmlbillingactionnotifydocumentation for INAPPNOTIFYa is specific to v2 of inapp billing. It doesnt seem to be something thats available in v3 since its not mentioned anywhere in the v3 reference nor can I find any reference for it in the a hrefhttpsgithub.comobriandandroidiabv3trivialdrivesample TrivialDrive appa that they are using to demonstrate IAB v3.p  pSo does v3 of IAB support refundscancelling purchases Has any one tried it and got it workingp

Negative 7715 pIt is my understanding that codeCAShapeLayercode basically draws its shape into a codeCGImageRefcode.

Negative 7715 pWith an emphasis on finding the time when the intersection starts, although the position is also important.  The bounding boxes not axis aligned have a position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocity rate of rotation.  NO accelerations, which should really simplify things...  And I could probably remove the angular velocity component as well if necessary.  Either a continuous or iterative function would work, but unless the iterative function actively converges toward a solution or lack thereof, it probably would be too slow.p  pI looked at a hrefhttpwww.metanetsoftware.comtechniquetutorialA.html relnofollowthe SATa, but it doesnt seem to be built to find the actual time of collision of moving objects.  It seems to only work with nonmoving snapshots and is designed to work with more complicated objects than rectangles, so it actually seems illsuited to this problem.p  pIve considered possibly drawing the trajectory out of each of the 8 points then somehow having a function for if a point is in or out of the other shape and getting a time range of that occurring, but Im pretty lost on how to go about that.  One nice feature would be that it operates entirely with time and ignores the idea of discrete steps, but it also strikes me as an inefficient approach.p  pNo worries about broad phase determining if its worth seeing if these two bounding boxes may overlap, I already have that tackled.p
Negative 7715 pIve been trying to set up custom pronunciations for a NSSpeechSynthesizer derived speech engine used by my app. However, Ive been running into problems.p  pIm creating a new dictionary to add to my speech engine using the keys specified in the NSSpeechSynthesizer class reference, but the documentation is very confusing and missing some important information. The relevant section is entitled Speech Dictionary Property Keys at the following link a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaReferenceApplicationKitClassesNSSpeechSynthesizerClassReferenceReference.html relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaReferenceApplicationKitClassesNSSpeechSynthesizerClassReferenceReference.htmlap  pIm a bit confused by this, because it seems like the NSSpeechDictionaryPronunciations key contains the same information as NSSpeechDictionaryEntryPhonemes and NSSpeechDictionaryEntrySpelling. There is also no information on whether all the keys are required, or if theyre optional, what constitutes valid data for each key, or how to obtain existing values from the already initialized speech engine. I also cant find any details on when it is acceptable to add a new speech dictionary.p  pWhat I have assumed, based on what I gather from this documentation, is that a speech dictionary is that each key is optional, and appends to whatever data is already being used by the engine, with newly added dictionaries taking preference over existing data where there are conflicts. Ive defined a diuctionary containing just the NSSpeechDictionaryPronunciations key, with the value being an array of NSDictionary objects containing the keys NSSpeechDictionaryEntrySpelling and NSSpeechDictionaryEntryPhonemes, as detailed in the documentation. The speech engine is already initialized when I call addSpeechDictionary.p  pHowever, this throws an error. The actual error code that gets thrown depends on the voice Ive chosen, but it always throws an error, and the defined pronunciations have no effect.p  pI can only assume that Im doing something wrong, but since I cant find any information anywhere on how this functionality is to be used beyond the very vague documentation, Im a bit stuck. Does anyone have any experience with this feature and coudl point me in the right direction Or even point me in the direction of a book or something that covers this in better detail Google has been no help...p

Negative 7715 pCurrently Im working on a huge project that involves thousands of lines of CSS, JavaScript and a bunch of images. Minifying CSS style sheets and JavaScript files with added compression helps a lot, but it still isnt perfect.p  pFor preloading images in CSS stylesheets, I have found a bunch of plugins, including here on stackoverflow. However, since there are a lot of jQuery and JavaScript libraries  preloading just CSS images in stylesheets doesnt help my cause at all. Is there a way to preload the CSS files themselves, along with images found in those files, and JavaScript libraries in one go I would use such a feature after confirming user credentials, and after preloading the required content redirecting users to the inner content.p  pAlso I could easily provide an array of files needed for preloading, without having JavaScript to parse any files.p

The endpoint seems to be being pushed farther along the x axis in the positive direction than it should be, and in some spots its seems to sort of...skip, as if there were a hole at that location or something. Although I still remember a bit of linear algebra from calculus, I dont remember enough to know exactly what Im doing here and Ive scoured through many of the resources online with no luck. Im hoping someone that reads this will have more experience dealing with this than I and will be kind enough to help me, or give me any tips if theres something else that I may be doing the wrong or in an inefficient way.p  pVariable Reference Matrices are all float arrays of length 16p  precodemProjectionMatrix  projection matrix  mModelMatrix  model matrix  mMVPMatrix  projection  modelview matrix  mMVMatrix  modelview matrix       private final FloatBuffer triangleVertices      private FloatBuffer lineVertices      private final int bytesPerFloat  4      private float[] viewMatrix  new float[16]      private static Context context      private int mMVPMatrixHandle      private int mPositionHandle      private int mColorHandle      private float[] mProjectionMatrix  new float[16]      private float[] mModelMatrix  new float[16]      private float[] mMVPMatrix  new float[16]      private float[] mMVMatrix  new float[16]      private final int strideBytes  7  bytesPerFloat     private final int lineStrideBytes  3  bytesPerFloat      private final int positionOffset  0      private final int positionDataSize  3      private final int colorOffset  3      private final int colorDataSize  4      private float width, height      private float[] lineStartPoint  new float[]0, 0, 1.5f      private float[] lineEndPoint  new float[]0, 0, 0 codepre
Negative 7715 pI am planning to create a web application using ASP.NET MVC4 using the code first approach.p  pI am using Visual Studio 2012 and I have SQL Server 2012.  What I would like to do is setup the solution in a way that I can use SQL Server instead of the default being SQL Express or localDB.  I would like to have the solution regenerate the database if any changes are made to the models and seed the database with some test data when that occurs.p  pI have gone through a bunch of tutorials and they all seem to be using the SQL Express or LocalDB database.  I was able to get the solution to generate the database on SQL Server the first time it was run,  but after I make changes to the model such as alter the schema name from dbo to lets say test or change the table name, it doesnt seem to pick up those changes.p  pCan anyone give me some insight on how I might be able to accomplish thisp  pThanksp

The last column is for Grand Total but I extract data only till the previous column and not for the Grand Total column.p  pNow in the above code Instead of B4D4 in the rg range, I want D4 cell to be a variable so that it can be anything like Z4 or AK4 etc. It there are three persons, the cell address it takes from the source sheet wsSource is from B4D4, if there are 10 persons, it will be from B4K4. If there are 100 persons again it will change to B4x4, where x will be the 1001th  column of the source excel sheetwsSource.p  pI am not able to pass this variable to the following code    Set rg  wsSource.RangeB4D4p  pSo, what it should do if there are n persons which I may not know the number of persons in the source sheet, there should be a variable which checks until the cell value starting from B4  is null, then in the next code it should automatically set the range for rg  wsSource.RangeB4x4, where x is the 1001th column.p  pBut during searching when there are three persons, it will get the null value in the F4 column and not in E4 column of the source sheetShipper VP, because the name of the persons are from B4 to D4, then there is an extra Grand Total column in E4. But in the range for rg,  I want only from B4 to D4 and not till the E4 column. The same is to be done for n persons in the Source sheet.p  pIf B4 is also a variable, then it is much better like y or something. Then I can set y as B4 as the starting cell number. And after that it will loop from B4 to the second last column value of Row 4 in the source sheetws.Source, since last column value of Row 4 will be Grand Total.p  pI will be really grateful if somebody can help me out in this.p  pThanks.

Negative 7715 pI have a database program that was written a few years back using MYISAM tables in a MYSQL database.  It is a pretty simple structure but I wasnt the one who set it up.  p  pAll the current releases of MYSQL are all set for INNODB and I just wondered how hard it would be to convert the current application from MYISAM to INNODB or is this something better handled by starting all over.  p  pConsidering I am not a database expert   Whatever way is the easiest. I have found most if not all the declaratives in the modules that state for the program to use MyIsam and it sure would be nice if I could just change the necessary parts to restate that as INNODB and get it to workp  pIs there a physical obstruction to using innodb that would prevent the change fro MYISAM As I said these are very small databases maybe 25 fields in 100 records total maximum.p  pThanks for any insightp

Negative 7715 pThis may seem quite simple to you guys but can someone please tell me or give me a link  WHY the newer Visual Studios VS 2005 and later do not target .net 1.0 and 1.1 frameworks I have only checked out the VS 2005 and 2008 express editions I am assuming that it is the same for the nonexpress editions too.p  p[Pardon the mixed flow of thoughts here.] I mean, from what I am seeingperception of a layman when one installs a particular .net framework, the installer installs the previous frameworks too. Now, I would like to target the older frameworks 1,1.1,2,3 because they are relatively smaller installs compared to say .net 4. From where I come not many people have a bandwidth to wait for that kind of downloadhome users and not business people.p

Considering the purpose of the codeUoWcode business transaction, the method codeCommitcode should be exposed only to the one who started a strongBusiness Transactionstrong for example Business Layer.

Negative 7715 pI have an Activity containing a ViewPager that displays N fragments. Each fragment is showing the properties of an object from an ArrayList in my ViewPagers custom adapter extends codeFragmentStatePagerAdaptercode.p  pThe fragment has among other things a button that should remove the currently displayed fragment and scroll to the next one with codesetCurrentItemposition, truecode so that if the user scrolls back, the previous item is gone. I do so by using something like this simplifiedp  precodedeleteButton.setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener       Override     public void onClickView v                 MyActivity parentActivity  MyActivitygetActivity                 First, scroll to next item smoothly               parentActivity.pager.setCurrentItemparentActivity.pager.getCurrentItem1, true                  Database stuff...               doSomeDBOperations                 Method in Activity that removes the current object I believe this method is working fine and yes, it calls notifyDataSetChanged               parent.removeObjectcurrentObject        codepre  pThis has the desired behavior as the object represented by the fragment whose delete button was pressed gets removed and the viewpager goes to the next page. p  pMy problem is that the ViewPager doesnt scroll smoothly but rather jumps instantly to the next fragment. If I comment the coderemoveObjectcode call, the smooth scroll works but the item isnt removed. I believe its has something to do with the coderemoveObjectcode being called before the setCurrentItem has finished the smooth scrolling animationp  pAny ideas on how to fix this and achieve item removal  smooth scroll If my assumption is correct, how can I make sure I get the smooth scroll to finish before removing the objectp  pstrongEDIT 1strong p  pMy assumption seems correct. If I put the codeparent.removeObjectcurrentObjectcode inside p  precode ...inside the previously shown public void onClickView v... confirm.postDelayednew Runnable       Override     public void run                 Method in Activity that removes the current object I believe this method is working fine and yes, it calls notifyDataSetChanged               parent.removeObjectcurrentObject      , 1000 codepre  pso that the coderemoveObjectcode call waits for a second, it works as expected scroll to the next item, remove the previous.

Negative 7715 pMy Durandal applications startup logic in shell.js requires sending the user to one of two possible views depending on some conditional logic. Basically, if certain options have not previously been selected Ill send them to a Setup page, otherwise Ill send them to the normal start page.p  pPreviously, in Durandal 1.x I would just pass a string indicating the starting module when calling activate. But in Durandal 2.x that has been deprecated.p  pSo first, Im wondering what is the recommended way to do this from the standpoint of the routes array Should I just register both routes as if neither is the start module like below then conditionally add a another route to the array with the default route of p  precode route setup, moduleId setup, title Setup, nav false ,  route Students, moduleId students, title Students, nav false  codepre  pThe second part of my question involves how to handle the need to make a call to a web service as part of my conditional logic for determining which module is the start module. My startup logic involves checking the local storage of the browser, but sometimes Ill also need to make an ajax request to the server to get a bit of information.p  pMy understanding is that router.activate is a promise. Can I actually just create my own promise and resolve it by calling router.activate after the ajax call has completed Or is there another way Ill need to handle that Sample code for how I was thinking I might handle thisp  precodevar deferred  .Deferred  Setup and conditional logic here var routes  setupRoutes  .getapimyStartupEndpoint  .donefunctionresults      check results and maybe alter routes     deferred.resolverouter.maproutes.activate    return deferred.promise codepre  pDoes that make sense Im still converting my app over to Durandal 2.0.1 so I havent been able to try this yet, but regardless of whether it does or not I want to find out what the recommended approach would be in this scenario.p

Negative 7715 pSo here is my case. I have one main activity and when I start it I fetch some data from a local server via JSON in an AsyncTask and store that data in an ArrayList. Also when I launch the app I start a service which is polling data from the server every X seconds. I use an intent to send that arrayList to the service so it can compare and see if there are any changes. The service is supposed to run all the time even if the app is closed. All that is managed so far but I did a big mistake not storing the initially fetched data from the activity in SQLite or something like that. Do you think its a good idea to do that  Using SQLite for checking for updates   I also forgot to mention that if I close the app and when the service tries to compare it gets a nullpointer because I assume the activity does not exist anymore once I stop it.p  pI am open to suggestions.p

I have a client who wants a standalone HTML page running locally which would display one form with couple of textbox and one button. After info is entered and user click that button, a second form should show up with new textboxes. Form cant have a redirection to another website or file. It all has to be in that HTML file.p  pI figured out this would be easiest to do with jQuery but loading whole library just to hide one form is plain stupid. So I take a look at other option and decided to use pure Javascript.p  pThe problem is when I click NEXT first time the 1st form disappear but then apear a second later like some sort of request is sent. Bellow is the code I currently have. I tried making an JSFiddle but browser blocks every time I access it.p  pstrongJavascriptstrongp  precodefunction hideAll    document.getElementByIdfirst.style.display  block   document.getElementByIdsecond.style.display  none   showFirstForm   function showFirstForm    if document.getElementByIdsecond.style.display  block      document.getElementByIdfirst.style.display  block     document.getElementByIdsecond.style.display  none        function showSecondForm    if document.getElementByIdfirst.style.display  block        document.getElementByIdsecond.style.display  block     document.getElementByIdfirst.style.display  none     codepre  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodeltbody classif5 onloadhideAllgt  Im loading hideAll on refresh to hide second form    ....     lt FORM 2 gt     ltform idfirst action classtxanmelden methodpost autocompleteoff gt      ltfiledsetgt     ltlabel fornamegt Your name ltlabelgt     ltinput namename valueMyName gtltinputgt     ltbutton onClickshowFirstFormgtNextltbuttongt     ltfiledsetgt     ltformgt       lt FORM 1 gt     ltform idsecond classtxanmeldengt      ltfieldsetgt     ltlabel fornamegt Your name ltlabelgt     ltinput namename valueMyNaffffffme gtltinputgt     ltbutton onClickshowSecondFormgtNextltbuttongt     ltfieldsetgt     ltformgt    .... codepre  pemReferencesem  p  ul lia hrefhttpwww.w3schools.comjsrefmetdocumentgetelementbyid.asp relnofollowgetElementByIDali ul

Negative 7715 pI have an app that is deployed using Java Web Start. On certain client machines, as Web Start downloads the JAR files about 60 of them, the downloads sporadically hang, and the app fails to launch.p  pTo determine whether the problem was with Web Start directly or with the client network settings, we wrote a separate script to download the JARs in sequence using wget. The script also suffers from the same issue, eventually hanging after a few JARs have been successfully downloaded. Introducing a slight pause in between downloads allows the downloads to succeed.p  pSo, the problem is not with Web Start directly, but unfortunately were between a rock and a hard place. We have to use Web Start in the short term, and doing custom troubleshooting of client networksfirewalls is not ideal its happening on several  networks.p  pI have two questionsp  ul liWhat typically blocks the download of a sequence of JAR filesli liIs there a way to make Web Start download the JARs with slight pauses in between, as a way to work around the client network problemsli ul  pI would appreciate any tips from anyone who has encountered similar issues.p

Negative 7715 pI have to implement one linked list type of data structure using just arrays no malloconly static memory. What exactly i have to do is like this 1 I have an array of set of elements, lets say  array [216]1 2 3 4  I will take very big size, thats why 216 here.p  p2I have to make addition at index 0,1 and 2,3 and 4,5 etc. At index 0,1 we have1,2, their addition is 3. this 3 is then will be positioned at last of the array I mean after 6, so the array now is1 2 3 4  3. emThis i have already implemented.emp  pWhat i have to do is p  p3 I have to make the program like this that each element must have its valueSuppose i call value as Freq in my code and index of next element it points to and last element which has nothing to point must contain 1 at next. Just like as below I havent done addition yet, Its intially,After addition is done it size will grow see at last for that please.

Negative 7715 pIn the spirit of well designed OO, a certain class I am extending has marked one of its fields protected. This class has also generously provided a public setter, yet no getter.p  pI am extending this class with a base class that is in turn extended by several children. How can I restrict access to the protected variable from my children while still being able to manipulate it privately and set it publiclyp  pSee example belowp  precodepublic abstract class ThirdPartyClass    protected Map propertyMap    public void setPropertyMapMap propertyMap     this.propertyMap propertyMap        Other methods that use propertyMap.   public abstract class MyBaseClass extends ThirdPartyClass  Accessor methods for entries in propertyMap.   public getFoo     propertyMap.getFoo       public getBar     propertyMap.getBar       etc...   public class OneOfManyChildren extends MyBaseClass   Should only access propertyMap via methods in MyBaseClass.  codepre  hr  pI have already found that I can revoke access by making the field codeprivate finalcode in codeMyBaseClasscode. However that also hinders using the setter provided by the super class.p  pI am able to circumvent that limitation with the cleverness below yet it also results in maintaining two copies of the same map as well as an On operation to copy over every element.p  precodepublic abstract class MyBaseClass extends ThirdPartyClass    private final Map propertyMap  new HashMap  Revokes access for children.

Sadly I have no control over that.p  pstrongNotestrong ISA relatonship inheritance required.p  h2strongNotestrong This could easily apply to any Collection, DTO, or complex object.h2  pstrongMetaphor for those misunderstanding the questionstrongp  pThis is akin to a grandparent having a cookie jar that they leave accessible to all family members and anyone else in their house protected. A parent, with young children, enters the house and, for reasons of their own, wishes to prevent their children from digging into the cookie jar ad nauseam. Instead, the child should ask the parent for a chocolate chip cookie and see it magically appear likewise for a sugar cookie or Oreo. They need never know that the cookies are all stored in the same jar or if there even is a jar black box. This could be easily accomplished if the jar belonged to the parent, if the grandparent could be convinced to put away the cookies, or if the grandparents themselves did not need access. Short of creating and maintaining two identical jars, how can access be restricted for children yet unimpeded for the parent amp grandparentp

Negative 7715 pWe have a site where on the left we are displaying our products and on the right shows the product the user clicks on on same page.  When the page loads we have the first product being shown on the right by default, when the user clicks on a new product then the right columns changes to show the new product via ajax.p  pHere is how I have the ajax setupp  precodeltscriptgt jQuerydocument.readyfunction     var defaultValue  ul.products li.shopthumb afirst.attrhref      .main.loaddefaultValue    ul.products li.shopthumb a.clickfunctione       e.preventDefault        var addressValue  this.attrhref       alertaddressValue      .main.loadaddressValue      a.woocommercemainimage.addClassimagepopupnomargins       ltscriptgt codepre  pWe are using magnific popup to show the larger image of the product when the user clicks on the right sides main product image.p  pThis works great for the first default product but when the user clicks on a new product and the content to the right changes, then the user clicks on the main image, the pop up fails to load.  So in other words it works when you first load the page and the default product is shown, but fails to fire when a new product is clicked.p  pHere is the productimage.php filter which just adds our class of imagepopupnomarginsp  precodeapplyfilters woocommercesingleproductimagehtml, sprintf lta hrefs itempropimage classwoocommercemainimage imagepopupnomargins titlesgtsltagt, imagelink, imagetitle, image , postgtID  codepre  pAnd in the footer we have thisp  precode.imagepopupnomargins.magnificPopup       type image,       closeOnContentClick true,       closeBtnInside false,       fixedContentPos true,       mainClass mfpnomargins mfpwithzoom,  class to remove default margin from left and right side       image          verticalFit true       ,       zoom          enabled true,         duration 300  dont foget to change the duration also in CSS             codepre  pIm may have given too much info here but I felt better safe then sorry, so perhaps its better if I give you a link for you to see what I mean.  When you visit the page, click on the big image on the right and you should see the popup functioning.  Now try clicking on one of the products on the left so the main image on right changes and try to click it again, the default behavior happens instead of our pop up.p  pI checked classes and everything looks fine, Im sure it has to do with the ajax but cant get it worked out.p  pstrongUpdatestrong After more tinkering with this I think the problem is that the .load is not reloading the content when the anchor is clicked.  Like I said it works when you first load the page and click on the first image, but when you change the image and the ajax is called I dont think it really reloads the content in the main container.  How would I make sure the ajax is fully loading the content like it does when you first open the page  If you go to the site and click the big image on right, it works, change the image by clicking on a product from the left and the pop up fails to work and so does the Tag It pop up  Maybe this is less specific to magnific popup and more of a basic ajaxp

See the refreshTabs function in the emDashboardViewModelem object.p  pThis works, but is less than ideal since it forces the ViewModel to know something about the View which is an MVVM nono.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ol liCan I tell jQuery Mobile to hold off applying the grid class to the navbar until after the bindings have been applied I poked around its API but didnt see anything particularly useful.li liIs there something I can do with Knockouts custom bindings Again, trying not to inject any DOM manipulation into the ViewModel.li liIn general, any other workarounds, comments on the code, etc. would be appreciated.li ol

And messages have following structure codeint what, int arg, Object Message.code So, I use messages in messages. This is caused by feature, that depending on what argument, message in object may be sent to different activities or cached until needed activity not become visible.

Negative 7715 pI am having trouble calculating a value through a function with the click of the button I created called Submit. I created two Radio Buttons to select which value of pi to let the user choose. The two different values that the user could choose were 3.14, the rational abrupt version of pi that most textbooks use to compute the area and circumference of a circle, and the irrational, regular version of pi, 3.1415... and so on. I created the pi variable outside of the function that calculates the final value through the expression that is linked to the radio buttons. When one radio button is selected, the variable value then has the value for that radio button sent to it. I can then manipulate the variable value and choose logically in my code to set the variable pi equal to the rational or irrational version pi. I am having trouble using the pi variable inside one of my functions. I know that I have to use global variables and I tried to, but I just couldnt get it to work.

I have read that it is doable in Java 8 which Im using but Ive not been able to find any relevant examples.p  pI apologise if this turns out to be a duplicate question, but Ive been unable to find a similar example that quite matches these requirements. Most other examples seem content simply to list the files, rather than perform an action with them.p  pMany thanks in advance.p

Negative 7715 pI am new to leaflet but have developed some interactive maps in the past. I started working on displaying a gps device on a UAV. The UAV sends the location information on a server and has a php code that returns some sensor values upon relevant request in geojson format, so I dont have to do much... phew. I was looking for some solutions for how to do it seamlessly using Ajax when i came across a hrefhttpsgithub.comcalvinmetcalfleafletajax relnofollowleafletAjax.a. I had a lot of issues which were mostly resolved by some questions on stackoverflow for example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20485723addexternalgeojsontoleafletlayerthis onea and a few others.p  pNow here is how i am writing my code for the markers for the pointsp  precodevar geojsonLayer  new L.GeoJSON.AJAXmyservergetgeoj.phpstypeparticleampsval[min]2ampsval[max]26,pointToLayer redmarkers, onEachFeature popUp function popUpfeature, layer      layer.bindPopupfeature.properties.sensorv , codepre  pI have another function redmarkers that returns red colored circle markers. What happens is that finally it is loading the data from the server... phewh.... but it does not bind the popup or the markers to this layer. It looks for the I guess some default marker images in the jsimagesmarkericon.png as marker symbol. This doesnot exist and so it gives me an error. But if i take any random image and call it markericon.png and put it in the desired location it shows that image on the map but still does not bind the popup.p  pWhat am i doing wrong. As i am new to stack overflow as well if you need more information or if i am not asking the question right please let me know.p

But since the execution times should be manageable, we would need to have a way to interrupt that timer and create a new one, or we could simply kill that process and create a fresh one.p  pDoes anyone have any thoughts on how it should be done properly, or are they any libraries for accomplishing this particular scenariop
Negative 7715 pSuppose you have a circle that is 1 cm in radius.

Negative 7715 pI have an app and I am using the parse.com framework. I am having trouble with reading the number for my data in my data browser.  I have code in my app that goes like...p  precodePFObject object  self.objects[indexPath.row]  if object[comments] gt 0       cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifiercommentCell]    else       cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierotherCell]   codepre  pThe problem is, when I first ran this code it worked perfect. But when I changed the values in the data browser a number column called comments the value from 1 to 0 and then pull to refresh my PFQueryTableViewController, it still dequeues the commentCell instead of the cell without the comments. p  pIts like it either isnt checking right or I am doing something wrong because nothing changes.p  pI was beginning to think maybe my if statement is not the way to check for a number from the parse database. Can anyone point me in the right directionp

Negative 7715 pThe official file extension for a file containing JSON data is code.jsoncode. However after using MongoDB for a while, I realize this extension is actually used for two types of JSON formatsp  ol liA file containing one single JSON document with optional pretty printing, including line breaks.li liA file which contains multiple lines of minified JSON documents. Here each line is JSON, but the entire file is not valid JSON itself.li ol  pFor example, the a hrefhttpdocs.mongodb.orgmanualreferenceprogrammongoexport relnofollowmongoexporta manual uses codeoutput.jsoncode in many of its examples to create a file with many lines of JSON. However a parser that assumes the first format will probably choke on this file.p  pAre there any conventional alternate file extensions to distinguish the two scenariosp

Then I could use Url rewriting to overcome extra part which are added in the paths for pages. so for example map pagesaboutus to aboutuspli lipUse media types for this kind of blocks. About this I am not sure at all, because I see no option to copy items for other languages as it is done in document types.pli ol

That version was previously working on the Test environment otherwise it would not have been deployed to Live.p  pSo what gives Any suggestions where I should lookp
Negative 7715 pI recently installed the latest version of BlogEngine.NET v3.0.  The blog itself renders fine on my browser i.e., viewing the main page, individual blog posts, etc. However, when I log in and try to access any of the Admin pages i.e., Settings, Users, etc., I am getting an HTTP 403 Forbidden error.p  pThis is happening on both Windows Server 2008 R2 x64 as well as Windows Server 2012 x64.  When I installed a local copy on my Windows 8.1 Pro machine, it works fine.p  pI know the admin pages all render in MVCstyle, since the URL is adminsettings, for Settings for example.p  pI have literally tried everything.

Negative 7715 pTrying to get a handle on memory management with Backbone by using the heap snapshot tool in Chrome. Theres a back button on a view which when clicked will switch the current view with a new one via a backbone router. p  pI take a snapshot on the initial page, navigate to the page with the back button, click the back button and take another snapshot. Id expect heap snapshot to be identical using the comparison option. However old modelscollections seemingly arent being cleared they are highlighted in white in the snapshot i.e. still accessible via the root of the graph. Also it looks like the views themselves arent being removed eithersame white highlight in the snapshot. p  pIve linked a diagram to aid the explanation a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.commlN2I.jpg relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.commlN2I.jpga. Say view V1 nests three views of which V2 contains a model M1, V3 holds model M2 and V4 holds a backbone collection C1. M1 listens to a change to M2 and updates itself accordingly. In order to properly remove view V1 the following are donep  ul liCall Backbone.View.Remove on V1 and all its child views and the child views of those children if they existli liCall Backbone.Events.StopListening on all models and the child models of those models if they existli ul  pIs this enough to completely clear the view It seems like most resources online discuss proper disposal of backbone views but not its modelscollections. p  pAny help would be much appreciated.

The id will then be incremented at the database level after calling SaveChanges.li ul  pPlease, note that since I didnt call the SaveChanges method my newly added entity will have an empty Id.p  pThe problem comes up when I iterate a second time and that I have to create another objectp  ul liif I call the Find method, it will return the entity added in the previous iteration. because the ID will be the same null. The consequence is that my previously created object will be overwritten by the current one.li ul  pHere are my optionsp  ul liI know I could avoid this issue by using a Where instead of a Find but this is not an option, since it is supposed to save resources by requesting the store first.li liI could perform a check of the Id provided by the form first, and whether its value is null or not create an object or use the Find statement. However, I dont want to add more logic to my code if possibleli liI could generate a temporary unique Id when I create the new object. But this is not very clean in my opinion.li ul  pThis is the situation... I would like to know if there is any method or pattern which exists for this specific case or if I should aim one of the solutions mentioned abovep  hr  pEDIT To my great misfortune, the system was made in a very questionable way...not by me, hehe TTp  pTo make it simple, there are two fields that are updated each time a change is made updatedby and lastupdated. This means that whenever you want to save data the updatedby field is different from the value in the database. So whenever you save data all objects are considered as modified since this field is updated.p  pThat is why I need to go through a loop to update only the fields that I need which means all the fields except the 2 mentioned.p

Negative 7715 pThe first paragraph of the javadoc for BigDecimal saysp  blockquote Immutable, arbitraryprecision signed decimal numbers.     A BigDecimal consists of an arbitrary precision integer     unscaled value and a 32bit integer scale. If zero or positive,     the scale is the number of digits to the right of the decimal     point. If negative, the unscaled value of the number is     multiplied by ten to the power of the negation of the scale.     The value of the number represented by the BigDecimal     is therefore unscaledValue  10scale  blockquote  pCan someone explain what this means, especially the bit starting If negative, but preferably all of it I think that scale means the numbers after the decimal point, but does that mean the unscaled is the rest of itp

Some of then can be usual JSF views e.g. using Primefaces and some of them I intend to be Backbone.js pages that uses Java web services. strongCan this is done Is this good architecture Is it good to stick to the usual division that GUI should be made with HTMLJavaScriptfacelets and business logic should be implemented as Java beansrulesservicesstrong I have heard about pure JavaScript i.e. Node.js applications but I am not sure if JavaScript is appropriate for encoding business logic. E.g. Java has ORM, JavatoRules support e.g. in Drools rules engine, I doubt that JavaScript is integrated with such technologies.p

Negative 7715 pLarge sets of 32bit integer values, sorted ascending, only unique values, are stored for sequential reading. Original files are large, cannot fit into RAM, are read block by block.

Negative 7715 pI am a geologist working in the oil and gas business. I am also responsible for all of our technology. Over the past few weeks I have been designing a macro that interfaces with the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources website in order o create a program that automatically compiles production information. This website has been a huge help and the advice given by the users has been invaluable. I am once again stuck though, and in need of some help.p  pBefore I get into what I need, I just want to credit the users Jeeped and mrbungle for creating this code. It works just like I asked and has been a enormous success.p  pThe way the code works is that the code takes a serial number of a oil well in column A and then goes out to the Louisiana DNR website and uses this serial number to download the production report into a new worksheet. This new worksheet is named based on the value in Column C of the first worksheet.p  pCurrently, the code is written to retrieve the entire report and then to cut all the information out except for one table that I am interested in.p  pI would like to preserve 2 tables now instead of 1. I cant figure out how to do it. I have attempted to add a frow2 and lrow2 variable that equate to the second table I want preserved however due to the cut function, only the lower table will be preserved since the cut function cuts all data above a certain point. I think the answer lies somewhere in how to word the cut function. I cant figure out how to do it though.p  pThe way the cut function works presently is that it cuts all data above and below certain table names on the downloaded sheetp  pThe tables I would like to preserve are in order the Wells and the Perforations tablep  pHere is a serial number to a well in case you want to test out the program 57711p  pThe code is belowp  precodeOption Explicit  Public Const csURL As String        httpsonlite.dnr.state.la.ussundowncartprodcartconwellinfo2pWSNWSN Sub GatherPerforationsData Dim rw As Long, lr As Long, w As Long, wsn As String, wb As Workbook, frow As String, lrow As String  On Error Resume Next If Err.Number ltgt 0 Then MsgBox Exception occured  amp Err.Decscription  Application.ScreenUpdating  False Application.DisplayAlerts  False    With ThisWorkbook.SheetsWSNs     lr  .CellsRows.Count, 1.EndxlUp.Row     For rw  2 To lr         .Cellsrw, 2  0         For w  1 To .Parent.Sheets.Count             If .Parent.Sheetsw.Name  CStr.Cellsrw, 1.Value Then                 .Parent.Sheetsw.Delete                 Exit For             End If         Next w         wsn  ReplacecsURL, WSN, .Cellsrw, 1.Value         Set wb  Workbooks.OpenFilenamewsn, ReadOnlyTrue, addtomruFalse          frow  Application.WorksheetFunction.MatchPerforations, RangeAA, 0         lrow  Application.WorksheetFunction.MatchWell Tests, RangeAA, 0         lrow  lrow  1         frow  A amp frow         lrow  F amp lrow         Rangefrow, lrow.Cut RangeQ1         ColumnsAP.Select         Selection.Delete ShiftxlToLeft         Cells.EntireColumn.AutoFit          wb.Sheets1.RangeA1A3.Font.Size  12         wb.Sheets1.Copy After.Parent.Sheets.Parent.Sheets.Count         .Parent.Sheets.Parent.Sheets.Count.Name  .Cellsrw, 3.Value         wb.Close savechangesFalse         Set wb  Nothing         .Cellsrw, 2  1         Application.ScreenUpdating  True         Application.ScreenUpdating  False         .Parent.Save     Next rw     .Activate End With codepre  pFn     Application.DisplayAlerts  True     Application.ScreenUpdating  True End Subp  pPlease let me know if I can explain anything better. p

Negative 7715 pWe are using Web API 2.0 to serve clients in a context where SSL cant be used no public internet access, clients cant be expected to trust a selfsigned certificate. To secure content moving between the client and server, wed like to be able to encrypt it. Were OK with unencrypted HTTP headers only need to encrypt payload. The question is is there a way to insert a custom handler into both the request and response message pipelines so that we can apply a decryption as a request preprocessing step and an encryption as a response postprocessing stepp  pWe are using the builtin features of Web API to serializedeserialize between JSON and model classes, and dont want to have to refactor any of that existing code. So an encryption handler would have to be inserted at the very startend of the requestresponse pipeline. Is this possible, and if so, what is the technique to insert custom requestresponse content prepost processingp  pThe network is public in that users bring their own devices, but the network is isolated from the public internet. Clients will only use a custom application we are developing to consume our Web API service, so we can address implementation issues of a custom encryption scheme on both client and server side.p

Negative 7715 pAfter some problems with database connections timing out using Hibernate in our GWT webapp we chose to use c3p0 as a connection pool provider. Now I have a different problem strongThe app does not seem to return connections to the poolstrong. Instead it stalls on the first database access.p  pTo debug the issue I followed the recommendations in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14105932c3p0hangsinawaitavailablewithhibernatethis questiona, as my code hangs in awaitAvailable as well. So I used codecheckoutTimeoutcode to prevent clients from waiting indefinitely and codeunreturnedConnectionTimeoutcode together with codedebugUnreturnedConnectionStackTracescode to get the stack traces of the part of the code which does not return the connection.

Its print run of 2.6 million cards sold out very quickly and was replaced by Limited Editions Beta print run.

It was released as soon as Wizards of the n  Coast could afford to pay for the rest of the print run. The company took n  advantage of the fact that the first edition print run had been split to n  correct some minor problems in the rules and fix some errors on the cards. n  Clarifications were made to the rulebook, and Richard Garfields short fiction n  Worzels Tale was removed to make room. Like Alpha it had no expansion symbol, n  and the text on the bottom left consisted of only the artist credit. n  Although many players speak of Alpha and Beta as different sets, officially n  they are the same set, and the company had expected that people wouldnt n  necessarily be able to tell the two press runs apart.

Negative 7715 pI am trying to receive VLAN tagged packets in Scapy in Ubuntu but the VLAN header is missing in the received packet. Now, if I capture the packet with tcpdump and view it in Wireshark the header is intact. I found out that Linux strips VLAN tags from received packets and that libpcap is able to rebuild them again, so they are shown in a Wirshark trace and from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18994242whyisntscapycapturingvlantaginformationthis threada I learned that the header should be shown by Scapy if I use libpcap instead of a PFSOCKET for reception. I changed the socket to a L2pcapListenSocket, but the header is still missing. I guess I missed something here  if the Scapy L2pcapListenSocket and Wireshark both use libpcap to capture the packet, why is it shown in Wireshark but not in Scapyp

Negative 7715 pI have a few controllers and used Typhoon to inject an object as a property into these controllers. I used Plist Integration. I found that sometimes the object was not injected into the view controllers as expected. p  pFor example, MainTabBarController is the initial view controller and SplashViewController is some other view controller. I have injected the object as the property in the code. The object is verified to be injected into the MainTabBarController.p  pAt some point, I need to present the SplashViewController from the MainTabBarController as followp  precodeSplashViewController vc  [[UIStoryboard storyboardWithNameMain                                                        bundle[NSBundle mainBundle]]                       instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierSplashNavigationController]  [self presentViewControllervc                    animatedYES                  completionnil] codepre  pWhen I tried accessing the object in SplashViewController, it failed. The property does not contain the object. p  pAfter some investigation, I found that the storyboard I obtained by calling [UIStoryboard storyboardWithNameMain                                                            bundle[NSBundle mainBundle]] was NOT a TyphoonStoryboard, but that of MainTabBarController is a TyphoonStoryboard. I therefore changed it top  precodeSplashViewController vc  [self.storyboard                       instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierSplashNavigationController]  [self presentViewControllervc                    animatedYES                  completionnil] codepre  pAnd then the SplashViewController contains the injected object.

Negative 7715 pIm having a few issues resetting my canvas when the window resizes or after a given amount of time. I want to complete reset and have it fresh.

Negative 7715 h2Updateh2  pI found that in my many refactorings I was inheriting from codeUIViewControllercode instead of codeUITableViewControllercode, so I was missing some automatic behaviours that codeUITableViewControllercode provides. However, I still needed to manually handle the scroll views insets when the keyboard was being interactively dismissed. See my updated answer.p  hr  pI am trying to emulate iMessage in how the keyboard is dismissed when the user drags it to the bottom of the screen. I have it working with one small visual issue thats bugging me.p  pAs the keyboard is dragged off the screen the scroll indicators do not resize correctly  that is until it has been completely dismissed.p  pI use keyboard notifications to tell me when the keyboard has appeared to increase the content and scroll insets by the height of the keyboard. It seems I didnt need to do anything when the keyboard has been dismissed as the insets appear to be correct when it has been. However when dismissing interactively I cant update the insets during the dragging event.p  pTo illustrate the issue, the first image shows that content has scrolled off the top of the screen due to the space being occupied by the keyboard the user has scrolled to the last row in the tablep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxFDAV.png altKeyboard displayed, content scrolled to bottomp  pHere, the keyboard is being dismissed and is almost completely offscreen. However notice how the scroll indicators are completely the wrong size. All of the content is now almost on screen so the indicators should be stretching, however, what happens is that as the keyboard moves down, the scroll indicators move up and do not stretch. This is not what happens in iMessage.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2d4oj.png altKeyboard being dismissedp  pI think what Im doing is pretty standard, Im creating a UIToolBar iOS 8.3 and overriding these methods in my view controllerp  precodeoverride var inputAccessoryView UIView      return toolbar   override func canBecomeFirstResponder gt Bool      return true   func willShowKeyboardnotification NSNotification      let keyboardFrame  notification.userInfo[UIKeyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey] as NSValue     tableView.contentInset.bottom  keyboardFrame.CGRectValue.height     tableView.scrollIndicatorInsets.bottom  keyboardFrame.CGRectValue.height  codepre

Negative 7715 pIs it possible to set the minimum height of a row to be dynamic based on the content  A brief explanationp  pI have this piece of UI img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwbsIS.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe whole thing is divided into a grid with two rows, one  height  where the top message is and the other Auto height where the bottom option buttons are.  This works great with full UI as it keeps the buttons stacked at the bottom where I want them and the text is in the top blank section centered where it should be.p  pHowever, when I make it small enough so not everything fits, it starts to cover over the message text and leaves the bottom buttons.  I can sent a min height on the top row and when the top row gets to that minimum size it starts cutting off the recent files which is livable as it will rarely get to that small, and removing the older recent files is not a big deal.p  pSo the main issue is that the message can change based on the results of other code and it could be several lines or it could be just one line.  I can hard code the min height, but if I make it large enough to fit the longer messages there is a large margin around the one liners and if I fit the one liners it cuts off the longer ones.  Also since the text wraps, the height of the text message depends on the width of the window which is variable as well.  Is is possible to tell WPF that the minimum height of the row is the content height plus a marginp  pIf its not possible I can definitely live with a hard coded height so dont spend a lot of time, but I thought it would be worth asking p

However, if I am not mistaken, there is no other way to do a check other than calling GetObject and catching the exception like in the sample above. For a scenario where one would just want to know if an item exists, that doesnt seem to be ideal. Maybe an Exists method would be a nice to have in Akavache Or maybe I am missing somethingp  pUpdate2 Changing the example to not use an async method in the constructor.

Negative 7715 pIm making a game in cs6 air for android.  When I make animations for my game, I use the 3D software blender. In blender I make an animation, and then render it as a sequence of PNG images, which I import to Flash CS6. So if Im making a walk animation for my character, I make around 30 png images i blender, and import them as a sequence. This works pretty well most of the time, but I have a problem with some of the animations I made.  As an example I have an animation of an enemy that explodes. So in my game, there is sometimes a lot of enemies at the same time, and they explode when I click on them. But the explode animation makes the game pretty laggy.p  pThe question Is there a way to maybe convert the png images to something else, that doesnt lag Most of the other animations I made works without lagging. Maybe the explode animation is especially heavy, I dont know. I know that I could draw the animation myself in cs6, and then it would not lag, but it would take a lot of time, and not look as cool. p  pI hope I made myself clear, and thanks in advancep

The db auto increments the primary key even if no new rows were added. Here is the code that I usedp  precode    try         conngtinsertsometable, array             col1     gt data1,             col2     gt data2,             col3     gt data3             catch Exception e            switch getclasse                 case DoctrineDBALDBALException                     No problems here.

DBerror error .egtgetMessage                    break               codepre  pAnd I also had to do a multiple row unique index for the table, because I have to check if all the columns are the same. i.e. if the whole row is the same as the one we are trying to insert.p  pSo.. It works well otherwise, except that the auto increment value keeps rising up every time we tryinsertcatch. I dont think its a real problem, but it just feels stupid to waste numbers.. Dp

Negative 7715 pIve to develop an iPad app that should have a layout for portrait and a layout for landscape. This app should be able to work with iOS 8 and iOS 9.

Negative 7715 pIm trying to update an existing php site, to make fixed width, div based forms and display fields responsive.  The form in question is pretty simple 1 row, 34 columns, repeated 6 times down the page.  I say rows and columns, but they are actually divs floatleftdisplayblock, not a table or displaytable.  p  pThe first 23 divs are fixed width time and date inputs, the last div contains a text input, which Id like to expand to fill the remaining width of the row and shrinkexpand when the browser is resized.  When it reaches a certain width, it should wrap to the next line taking up 100 of its width.  Heres the code for the div  p  precodeltdiv classinputTypegt ltlabel fordetails classhiddengtDetailsltlabelgt ltinput namedetails typetext iddetails value classidlegt ltdivgt codepre  pNothing fancy going on there and no other properties effecting layout or position that I can see in code inspector.

For whatever reason, it emalwaysem wraps to the next line as soon as the browser is resized  even if there is plenty of space available.  Ive tried minwidths, maxwidths,  widths and fixed widths and nothing works as expected. Can anyone tell me how to fix this and possibly help me understand why its being such a painp  pMany thanks in advance.p  pEDIT  Just wanted to add a quick update to this in case anyone stumbles across it in their quest to make a responsive input field.  p  pTurns out inputs dont behave the way normal divs do...

Negative 7715 pIm using the ARToolKit for Android to build an AR app. I can apply the Projection Matrix and the Marker Transformation Matrix in OpenGL without problem, as explained in the ARSimple example. However, I did not find a way to apply correctly these to the jPCTAE camera.

However when I move the marker it quickly disappears off screen. Also, the cube and other models I tried to load seems to render in some sort of inverted way. For what I read on the web the ARToolKit matrices are relative to OpenGL world coordinates while jPCTAE has its own coordinates, and also that the projection matrix of jPCTAE is built internally  based on the fov, near and far clipping plane, position and rotation, and then I cannot set it directly.p  pHow do I translate the projection matrix and marker matrix to the jPCTAE enginep

Negative 7715 pAccording to a hrefhttpspytools.codeplex.comreleasesview123624 relnofollowthesea release notes, installing packages via conda install is supported in PTVS, which came preinstalled with my VS 2015. However, I cant seem to find how to access that option. My best guess was as follows p  ol liGo to Python Environmentsli liSelect my Anaconda install from the left side 3.4 64bitli liSelect pipli liType a package name in the search box waitress, for exampleli ol  pWhen I do this, I see the option pip install waitress from PyPI. Im guessing there should be another option there  conda install waitress, but I dont see it. There is another option in the list  Install waitress. But clicking on that just performs the install via pip, not conda. I confirmed waitress is a package thats available via conda by performing conda search waitress from the command line.p  pI found a hrefhttpspytools.codeplex.comworkitem2564 relnofollowthisa bug, and have confirmed the presence of the conda package and condameta directory in my anaconda distribution. I also opened the first JSON file in condameta and dont see a link to another environment.p  pI also found a hrefhttpsgithub.comMicrosoftPTVSissues358 relnofollowthisa more recent issue, but it appears to just be describing adding a UI element for managing conda packages.p
