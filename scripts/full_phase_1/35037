Positive 35037 pI have been doing some research on data mining algorithms and now I would like to do some tests to verify my conception. The purpose of the experiment is to gather some data in slave nodes, process it and then send the data to a central node which would merge data from all nodes. The central node would process data again and send results to the slave nodes different for each node. I have already implemented the algorithms which will be used for processing and now I am looking for a software DB, framework etc which suits my needs.p  pI would be grateful for any help.p
Positive 35037 pMy data is multidimensional with approximately 7 million records. I want to optimize my queries which will be some range queries on timestamp and on these dimensions. For examplep  precodeLet the records be of the format in json form              id   123,         colA  A1,         colB  B4,         colC  C6,         colD  D2         time  19921213 122443       SELECT  FROM mytable WHERE colA  A1 AND colB  B1 AND colC  C1 AND time gt 19901212 000000   codepre  pAs far as i could understand, an rtree or Xtree index would be a perfect option for my use case. Compound indexes cannot be used as the queries are not predetermined. Individual index on each will require intersection which is again a costly operation especially when done for a large number of dimensions.p  pBut i couldnt any suitable nosql database for the same. Most of the spatial databases support only 2dimensional data. Others are OLAP databases which usually are optimized for bulk nontransactional inserts.p  pIs there any high performance nosql database that supports such indexes or such functionality for a large number of dimensions p  pNote NoSQL is preferable as my number of dimensions may vary with each record. But suggestions are welcomed for SQL as well. MySQL supports such a functionality in its codeMYISAMcode engine but it is not transactional and has table level locking, limiting availability.p
Positive 35037 pI understand the benefit of nosql document oriented databasesof having related data in single doc .But how do people generally solve the problem like this one explained below.p  pfor example let us take the scenario of a document having information about an employee.p  precode   name  harish,  dept Electronics and Communication  codepre  pso similar to this there are n users.p  precode   name  harish,  dept  Electronics and Communication     name  surya,  dept  Electronics and Communication     name  vignesh,  dept  Electrical     name  vikas,  dept  Electronics and Communication  codepre  pnow if for some reason the management decides to change the department name from Electronics and Communication to the short form ECE.p  pBut now in this case it does not make sense for me to find all docs with department as Electronics and Communication and update it to ECE.p  phow is such a scenario handled in document oriented dbs.p  pIs it ok to do as p  precode   name  harish,  dept  1001     name  surya,  dept  1001     name  vignesh,  dept  1002     name  vikas,  dept  1001  codepre  pand have dept document separately asp  precode   id  1001,   name  Electronics and Communication ,    id  1002,   name  Electrical  codepre  pBut this forces me to read a employee record I should access 2 documents. also to update I should access two documents. which is  a cross document operation.p  pI am asking this question as document oriented dbs in general do not guaranteed atomicity when done across documents, it is guarantee only within documents. p

Positive 35037 pIm starting a new project a survey application and I chose RethinkDB as my database however, I have some questions about data modelling.

The other option is to create an codeanswerscode table and link to the question id and option but reports queries may be a problem as Ill have many questions per survey.p  pWhich path should I follow  Thanksp

Positive 35037 pWere dealing with a huge number of shards 70k, which makes our ES v 1.6.0, replica 1, 5 shards per index not so reliable. Were in the process of deleting indices, but were noticing that theres a spike of refreshmapping tasks after each individual delete if it matters, these delete actions are performed via the REST api.

Positive 35037 pA bit new to Mongo here.  I want to return a subset of a collection using find, but from a specified starting point.  I have a dictionarylike list of documents that I return in chunks and in alphabetical order via the codesortcode and codelimitcode parameters, but it always starts at the beginning of the collection.  p  pI want to be able to add a starts with parameter to the find method so that, for example, if I queried the letter h it would return all documents but with the first one returned being the first document starting with h.  Using next would eventually return documents starting with i, j, k, and so on.  I also havent been able to find any uses or hacks to allow for a previous method that does the opposite of next.  Id like to use previous or whatever it may be called, to return documents starting with g, f, all the way back to the beginning of the collection. p  pAm I barking up the right tree  This seems like a pretty obvious function of a database, but I havent found any examples or other mention of using Mongo like this.p
Positive 35037 pIm still fairly new to NoSQL databases, but the queryable object store concept seems straightforward enough.  However in planning my algorithm for a emContent Based Image Retrievalem database, I need to wrap my head around the process by which Couchbase compares the stored properties.  p  pIt seems that writing documents only accepts an NSString, so Im assuming the given NSDictionary keys are only assumed to be strings.

But what about objects that that arent as cut and dry and strings or whose description method doesnt represent it well enough  What mechanism is used for equality and are there other operators than just equality  Can my objects adopt NSCopying protocol and be stored and restoredp  pIve also looked into NanoStore.  It seems to store more ObjectiveC ish data structures, though it apparently hasnt been updated since 2013.  Perhaps its a better suit for my needsp

Take the data set and the incremental data as input of mapper, and do the updates in reducer.

We also consider doing daily updates i.e. only update the data set when all incremental data is ready. But it takes more than one day to finish the whole mapreduce job...pli lipstrongnosqlstrong. Keep the data set in a distributed nosql database in our case, rocksdb, and do the updates with the database. Since most of keys will be updated, we CANNOT do the update with the GetUpdateSet pattern too many keys, and random read is slow. Luckily, keys in rocksdb are ordered, we can make the incremental data sorted, and do a merge sort with the data set in rocksdb. In this way, we only need do sequential read on rocksdb, which is fast. strongCompared to the hadoop solution, we dont need shuffle the large data set hourlystrong. Also, we can merge several hours incremental data before updating the data set, so that we dont need scan the whole data set hourly.pli ol  pThe second solution works good when the data set is NOT that big i.e. 3T. However, when the data set grows to 10T, theres too much disk read and write, and the system works bad.p  pIm wondering is there any good solution for incremental computation for big data, or is there any nosql for batch computation I really dont think hadoop is a good choice for incremental computation, especially when the incremental data is much smaller than the data set.p  pAny suggestion Thanksp

Is it okay that in the new codeMessagecode that will have multiple unused attributes based on type Is that inefficient in Parse.com Hypothetically, if codeMainMessagecode had way more say 10 attributes than codeChatMessagecode would this still be okay I believe the second approach is better because I can simplify the query for the feed. However, if there is anybody with anything to say on how I should be setting up the database, any comments are greatly appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 35037 pIm trying to use a .NET assembly from VB6 via interop without placing it in the GAC and without using the codebase argument for regasm.exe.p  pFrom what I understand, when I run regasm.exe on a .NET class library, it creates a registry entry for each class in the class library telling the COM clients they should load mscoree.dll that serves as a proxy wrapping .NET objects for COM use. Mscoree.dll uses the InprocServer32Assembly key in the registry for the class to determine which class library contains the implementation of the class.p  pIf I use codebase with regasm.exe or put my class library in the GAC, everything works OK but as far as I can figure out from the scattered documentation, mscoree.dll should look for the assembly in the current directory and in the path if codebase hasnt been used and therefore there is no CodeBase entry in the registry for the class and it cant find it in the GAC.p  pThe C code is as simple as can bep  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Text using System.Runtime.InteropServices  namespace myinterop      [GuidB1D6B9FEA4C711DDB06BE93056D89593]     [ClassInterfaceClassInterfaceType.AutoDual]     [ComVisibletrue]     public class MyServer              public int Addint a, int b                      return a  b                codepre  pAnd the problem reproduces with a VBScript one liner that I put in the same directory as the compiled DLLp  precodeobject  CreateObjectmyinterop.MyServer codepre  pWhat am I missing here Is there a definitive description of the way mscoree.dll looks up the assemblies somewherep  pBTW, Im using .NET 2.0 and yes, I know I should put my assemblies in the GAC, Im just wondering why this doesnt work as advertised.p

Negative 35037 pI am working on a few PHP projects that use MVC frameworks, and while they all have different ways of retrieving objects from the database, it always seems that nothing beats writing your SQL queries by hand as far as speed and cutting down on the number of queries.p  pFor example, one of my web projects written by a junior developer executes over 100 queries just to load the home page.  The reason is that in one place, a method will load an object, but later on deeper in the code, it will load some other objects that are related to the first object.p  pThis leads to the other part of the question which is what are people doing in situations where you have a table that in one part of the code only needs the values for a few columns, and another part needs something else  Right now in the same project, there is one get method for each object, and it does a SELECT  or lists all the columns in the table explicitly so that anytime you need the object for any reason, you get the whole thing.p  pSo, in other words, you hear all the talk about how SELECT  is bad, but if you try to use a ORM class that comes with the framework, it wants to do just that usually.  Are you stuck to choosing ORM with SELECT  vs writing the specific SQL queries by hand  It just seems to me that were stuck between convenience and efficiency, and if I hand write the queries, if I add a column, Im most likely going to have to add it to several places in the code.p  pSorry for the long question, but Im explaining the background to get some mindsets from other developers rather than maybe a specific solution.  I know that we can always use something like Memcached, but I would rather optimize what we can before getting into that.p  pThanks for any ideas.p
Negative 35037 pOne thing I plan to be doing is writing painfully simple Perl scripts, and Id like to be able to run them without explicitly calling Perl from the terminal.

Negative 35037 pI am using Delphi 2009. I have a very simple data structure, with 2 fieldsp  ol liA string that is the key field I need to retrieve by and is usually 4 to 15 characters in length.li liA string that is the data field that may be any size, from 1 character up to say 10,000 characters.li ol  pThe difficulty is that I may have several million of these records, so they may total as much or more than 10 GB in size. Obviously, Im looking for an ondisk solution rather than an inmemory solution.p  pMy program needs to randomly retrieve these records, based on the key field. Thats that part that needs to be made as efficient as possible.p  pShould I use a database for such a simple structure, and if so, which database would be best to handle this and be simplest to implementp  pAlternatively, is there a simple ondisk data structure not requiring a fullblown database that would work just as wellp  hr  pWell, all I needed was the one answer to kick me back into reality. I was looking for something simpler than even a simple database. But when the noduh answer is to use a database, then I realize Ive already answered this question with my own answer to another question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions445357bestdatabaseforsmallapplicationsandtools445565Best database for small applications and toolsa.p  pMy answer was a hrefhttpwww.yunqa.dedelphidoku.phpproductssqlite3 relnofollowDISQLite3a for a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions445357bestdatabaseforsmallapplicationsandtools445565445565the reasons I specified therea. And thats what Ill probably with for my implementation.p  hr  pA few more good answers with some possibilities. Thats great. Ill be able to try a few different methods to see what works best.p  hr  pMore contemplation, and I have had to change the accepted answer to the GpStructuredStorage solution.p  pIn my case, a million records totalling several Gigabytes will put a strain on a database structure. Specifically, the B tree that is used to store the index in most databases is fast, but will slow down for some operations such as reindexing a million values. p  pThe only thing youll find faster than B for an index is a hash table. And that is precisely what is provided in gabrs suggested addition to the GpStructuredStorage solution. I think its quite elegant the way he segmented the hash value to give a 4 level directory structure.p  pThe key reason why I can go to a hash solution is that I only need random access by the keys. I do not need to sort by the keys. If sorting was needed, then the gains of the speed of the hash table would be lost and the database system would be a nobrain winner.p  pWhen I get down to implementing this, I should do a comparison of this technique versus a database. Maybe Ill compare with both Firebird and SQLite which would both be worthy opponents.p  hr  pOne more followup p  pI just discovered a hrefhttpblog.synopse.infocategoryOpenSourceProjectsSynopseBigTable relnofollowSynopse Big Tablea by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers458259abouchezA.

Negative 35037 pMy job is to upgrade all of our applications that use OpenSceneGraph an openGl toolkit version 0.9.9 to the latest and greatest 2.8. Well quite a few caveats come with this taskp  p1. After version .9.9 there was a major overhaul the the core OpenSceneGraph OSG. Commonly used functions and classes were added and removed. Simply put, I cant just replace the old with the new and modify a few deprecated or removed functions  there is a lot that needs to be changed.p  p2. Our applications were built using MFC in Visual Studio 2003. They want me to stick with using that for the upgrade.p  p3. Good organized documentation for my particular scenerio for OSG seems impossible to find and unorganized and scattered at best.p  pMy question is What would be a somewhat detailed methodical approach for tackling this problem. Ive got about two weeks to upgrade one of the applications. The plan is then to follow and apply this approach for the rest of the applications. For me, the biggest hurdle is finding a starting point. On most projects I work on, I can easily just dig right in and figure it out with a little organization and plan at hand. This seems like a bit more convoluted problem, with a more accurate and precise plan of action needed. Your ideas and suggestions are much appreciated.p

Negative 35037 pIm using a web application project.p  pI have a folder in my web root called Users and in the folder I have a page called UserList.aspxp  pWhat I want to be able to do is type in Response.RedirectUsers.UserList.URLp  pWhat I reckon I can probably do is create a class that extends Page and add a static property called URL that calls MethodInfo.GetCurrentMethod.ReflectedType I think this works havent tested and then have that convert Users.UserList  UsersUserList.aspxp  pThe problems with this method that I know of are one I need to go through every page and make it extend the base class and it doesnt work with any pages that contain a  character.p  pThe advantages are that if pages are moved around then there arent any broken links Resharper gives out when there is a Page with the wrong namespace.p  pAlso then every individual page that takes query string params could have a static method so that if I want to addremove params I can see what uses those params etc. Also if I want to call that page I dont have to check the name of the params e.g. UserId userId, Id or id. So that would look something like Users.ViewUser.GetUrl1  UsersViewUser.aspxUserId1p  pSo the question is Is there a better way of doing this Or is this a bad idea in principalp

Negative 35037 pIve seen a few questions on this topic already but Im looking for some insight on the strongperformance differencesstrong between these two techniques.p  pFor example, lets say I am recording a log of events which will come into the system with a dictionary set of keyvalue pairs for the specific event. I will record an entry in an Events table with the base data but then I need a way to also link the additional keyvalue data. I will never know what kinds of Keys or Values will come in so any sort of predefined enum table seems out of the question.p  pThis event data will be constantly streaming in so insert times is just as important as query times.p  pWhen I query for specific events I will be using some fields on the Event as well as data from the keyvalue data. For the XML way I would simply use a Attributes.existsxpath statement as part of the where clause to filter the records.p  pThe normalized way would be to use a Table with basically Key and Value fields with a foreign link to the Event record. This seems clean and simple but I worry about the amount of data that is involved.p

Negative 35037 pI got this question from my cousin p  pWhat will be the best way to create a similar working website just like a hrefhttpwww.plakletters.nl relnofollowhttpwww.plakletters.nla.  I have looked into the website and think that to start of with im gonna help my cousin write a script that loads all fonts installed on the system into a dropdownlist. This dropdownlist will post a font value back to the page and will create images with the input of a user that comes from a textbox. This images will have to be created server side, and I also want to give the users the ability in the future to lay their own text over an uploaded image, to see what the result will look like on their own image. I found some information about how to create images using php, I dont know if php can output a list of installed fonts from the system its running on. What scripting language would you use to get this job done Keep in mind i would just like to start with outputting some images based on user input using a scripting language.p
Negative 35037 pCurrently my website is based around MVC and the Entity Framework running against a SQL Server 2005 database. So far, it has all been running very smoothly, and I really enjoy MVC and its slimmer more concise code and no huge viewstates or soul destroying postbacks p  pRecently I was working on upgrading the site to use a simple forum system, and this is where I started running into problems. When I was testing the site using two different browsers, if I created or replied to a post in one browser, the other browser couldnt see the post.p  pAt the moment, each visitor to the site gets their own copy of the entity model, which I store in their session data. Obviously this is the problem as updates to one model arent getting carried to the other.p  pAs a test, I tried storing a single copy of the model which all visitors would access by assigning the model to a static variable. This worked, and both browsers could see each others modifications. However, it had its side effects. For example, if I fired up both browsers at the same time and the model was initialized, one browser would crash, and the other would work fine, despite me using a locking object so in theory one of them should have been delayed until the model was ready of course I could have implemented this wrong . Also, originally this site did use one model for all visitors and when it was live, it frequently shut down  killing the IIS application pool while it did. Now Im not sure if this was related, but I dont really want to reintroduce whatever bug I had that caused this shut down.p  pSo, my question is a simple one really  what is the best way of either using the same model for all website users so they all see updates, or if they do have separate copies which I imagine will have a performance impact in time how can the models detect changes in the database and update themselves according.p  pThanks in advance for any advicep  pRegardsbr Richard Mossp

Negative 35037 pIf a file is committed several times with various changes, how can I fetch one change at a time, i.e., one changeset at a timep  pI use eclipse, subversion, and subclipse, and I cant change the former two for the time being or the MS platform...p  pIn my TeamSynchronization view in eclipse using subclipse, choosing the changeset model, a file seems to be listed only in the latest relevant changeset even if all changesets are listed.  So an earlier changeset doesnt necessarily show the full set of files in the original commit, nor the original diff for a file in a commit.p  pUpdate Im thinking about using changesets for simplified code review, so Id like the partial update represented for all the files commited in one changeset.

These OutOfMemoryExceptions are occurring long before my application ASP.Net has used up the 800mb available to it.  I have track the issue down to the area of code where the array is resized.  The array contains a structure that is 74bytes in size. I know that you shouldnt create structs that are bigger than 16bytes, but this application is a port from a Vb6 application. I have tried changing the struct to a class and this appears to have fixed the problem for now.p  pI think the reason that changing to a class solves the problem has to do with the fact that when using a struct and the array is resized, a segment of memory that is large enough to store the new array needs to be reserved e.g. currentArraySize  increaseBySize74 cannot be found.  This leads to the OutOfMemoryException.p  pThis isnt the case with a class as each element of the array only needs 8bytes to store a pointer to the new object.p  pIs my thinking correct herep

Negative 35037 pstrongBackgroundstrong I want to create a custom VB compiler, extending the original compiler, to handle my custom compiletime attributes.p  pstrongQuestionstrong after Ive created my custom compiler and Ive got an executable file capable of compiling VB code via the standard commandline interface, how do I integrate this compiler with the Visual Studio IDE such that pressing compile or build will make use of my compiler instead of the default compiler.p  pstrongEDITstrong Correct me if im wrongp  pFrom the reactions here, I see this question is a bit shocking, so I shall further explain my needs and background .NET provides us with a great mechanism called Attributes. As far as I understand, making attributes apply their intended behavior upon the attributed element assembly, module, class, method, etc.  attributes must be reflected upon. So the real trick here is reflecting and applying behavior at the right spot. p  pLets take Serialization for example We decorate a class with the Serializable attribute. We then pass an instance of the class to the formatters Serialize method. The formatter reflects upon the instance, checking if it has the Serializable attribute, and acting accordingly.p  pNow, if we examine the Synchronization, Flags, Obsolete and CLSCompliant attributes, then the real question is who reflects upon them At least in some cases, it has to be the compiler andor IDE. Therefore, it seems that if I wish to create custom attributes that change an elements behavior regardless of any specific consumer, i must extend the compiler to reflect upon them at compilation. p  pOf course, these are not my personal insights the book a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick1590591364Applied .NET Attributesa provides a complete example of creating a custom attribute and a custom C compiler to reflect upon that attribute at compilation the example is used to implement javastyle checked exceptions. p

The codeflock NUM ... NUMgtFILEcode syntax is from a hrefhttpmanpages.ubuntu.commanpageslucidman1flock.1.html relnofollowcodeflockcodes man pagea.p  pI expect that the first subshell will get an exclusive lock on test.lock, then wait 10 seconds, then print original finished, all the time holding the lock. The second subshell will start at more or less the same time, wait 2 seconds, then try to get a lock on test.lock, but timeout after 2 seconds. If it gets a lock, then itll print a finished. If it doesnt get the lock, that subshell should stop, and nothing should be printed.p  pSince the first subshell is waiting longer, it will keep the lock for 10 seconds, so the second subshell should not get the lock, and shouldnt finish. i.e. one should see original finished printed and emnotem both.p  pWhat actually happens is that a finished is printed, then original finished is printed.p  pThis implies that that the second subshell is either a not using the same lock as the first subshell or b that it fails to get the lock, but continues to execute or c something else.p  pWhy dont those locks work as I expectp

Negative 35037 pRegardless of the size of the buffers I provide the callback provided to AudioQueueNewInput occurs at roughly the same time interval.  p  pFor examplep  pIf you have .05 second buffers and are recording at 44k the callback first called about at .09 seconds and then a second call occurs right after .001 seconds. Then you wait again for .09 seconds.  If your buffer size was .025.  You would wait .09 seconds and then see 3 more buffers nearly instantly. p  pChanging the sample rate increases the latency. p  pRecording 16 bit 8k audio results in .5 seconds of latency between buffer floods. p  pSo I suspect that there is an 8000 byte buffer that is being used behind the scenes.

I then have a static method on the POCO called codeFromDBObjectcode which returns a new instance of that POCO.p  pIs this a good way to do things Im not hugely experienced in using factories so Im not sure if they would fit.

Negative 35037 pRecently Ive been doing some benchmarking of the write performance of my companys database product, and Ive found that simply switching to a 64bit JVM gives a consistent 2030 performance increase.p  pIm not allowed to go into much detail about our product, but basically its a columnoriented DB, optimised for storing logs. The benchmark involves feeding it a few gigabytes of raw logs and timing how long it takes to analyse them and store them as structured data in the DB. The processing is very heavy on both CPU and IO, although its hard to say in what ratio.p  pA few notes about the setupp  precodeProcessor Xeon E5640 2.66GHz 4 core x 2 RAM 24GB Disk 7200rpm, no RAID OS RHEL 6 64bit Filesystem Ext4 JVMs 1.6.021 32bit, 1.6.023 64bit Max heap size Xmx 512 MB for both 32bit and 64bit JVMs codepre  pConstants for both JVMsp  ul liSame OS 64bit RHELli liSame hardware 64bit CPUli liMax heap size fixed to 512 MB so the speed increase is not due to the 64bit JVM using a larger heapli ul  pFor simplicity Ive turned off all multithreading options in our product, so pretty much all processing is happening in a singlethreaded manner. When I turned on multithreading, of course the system got faster, but the ratio between 32bit and 64bit performance stayed about the same.p  pSo, my question is... Why would I see a 2030 speed improvement when using a 64bit JVM Has anybody seen similar results beforep  pMy intuition up until now has been as followsp  ul lip64bit pointers are bigger, so the L1 and L2 caches overflow more easily, so performance on the 64bit JVM is worse.pli lipThe JVM uses some fancy pointer compression tricks to alleviate the above problem as much as possible. Details on the Sun site a hrefhttpwikis.sun.comdisplayHotSpotInternalsCompressedOopsherea.pli lipThe JVM is allowed to use more registers when running in 64bit mode, which speeds things up slightly.pli ul  pGiven the above three points, I would expect 64bit performance to be slightly slower, or approximately equal to, the 32bit JVM.p  pAny ideas Thanks in advance.p  pstrongEditstrong Clarified some points about the benchmark environment.p

Lincr is a plain jane URL shortening service, while LinkBunch lets you shorten multiple links into one link. Ive had too much spam posted into the services, so I had to shut down Lincr. Now, even LinkBunch seems to be facing the same problem, and its been disabled by my web host for that reason.p  pI cant keep shutting down sites like this because of bad links being posted, so I need a malwarefiltering API that I can use to filter out the links as and when they are posted.p  pThere are services that let me download an entire bunch of bad links to check against, but instead, Id prefer doing a live API call on a perlink basis.

Negative 35037 pI want to use a clientserver protocol to push data to clients which will always remain connected, 247.p  pHTTP is a good generalpurpose clientserver protocol. I dont think the semantics possibly could be very different for any other protocol, and many good HTTP servers exist.p  pThe critical factor is the number of connections the application will gradually scale up to a very large number of clients, say 100,000. They cannot be servers because they have dynamic IP addresses and may be behind firewalls. So, a socket link must be established and preserved, which leads us to HTTP push. Only rarely will data actually be pushed to a given client, so we want to minimize the connection overhead too.p  pThe server should handle this by accepting the connection, inserting the remote IP and port into a table, and leaving it idle. We dont want 100,000 threads running, just so many table entries and file descriptors.p  pIs there any way to achieve this using an offtheshelf HTTP server, without writing at the socket layerp

Negative 35037 pIf I need to review indexes of more than 2000 tables, where do I start given the information from the spspaceused commandp  pIm investigating Indexes on tables, but am not quite sure what to make of the results for the IndexSize when I exec the spspaceused stored procedure in SQL.p  pFirstly, can I use the ratio between IndexSize and DataSize to make a call on wheter or not the indexes are optimal For example, if my DataSize for a table is 31 261 768KB and the IndexSize is 41 682 120KB, I divide indexSizeDataSize 100 and get a ratio of 133.

My first concern is identifying the customindexes that does not add value, and for this I thought about using the spspaceused procedure.p

Negative 35037 pIve created a codebook using kmeans of size 4000x300 4000 centroids, each with 300 features. Using the codebook, I then want to label an input vector for purposes of binning later on. The input vector is of size Nx300, where N is the total number of input instances I receive.p  pTo compute the labels, I calculate the closest centroid for each of the input vectors. To do so, I compare each input vector against all centroids and pick the centroid with the minimum distance. The label is then just the index of that centroid.p  pMy current Matlab code looks likep  precodefunction labels  assignlabelscentroids, X labels  zerossizeX, 1, 1   for each X, calculate the distance from each centroid for i  1sizeX, 1      distance of Xi from all j centroids is sumXi  centroidj2      note we leave off the sqrt as an optimization     distances  sumbsxfunminus, centroids, Xi,  . 2, 2     [value, label]  mindistances     labelsi  label end      codepre  pHowever, this code is still fairly slow for my purposes, and I was hoping there might be a way to optimize the code further.p  pOne obvious issue is that there is a forloop, which is the bane of good performance on Matlab. Ive been trying to come up with a way to get rid of it, but with no luck I looked into using arrayfun in conjunction with bsxfun, but havent gotten that to work. Alternatively, if someone know of any other way to speed this up, I would be greatly appreciate it.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pAfter doing some searching, I couldnt find a great solution using Matlab, so I decided to look at what is used in Pythons scikits.learn package for euclideandistance shortenedp  precode XX  sumX  X, axis1[, newaxis]  YY  Y.copy  YY  2  YY  sumYY, axis1[newaxis, ]  distances  XX  YY  distances  2  dotX, Y.T  distances  maximumdistances, 0 codepre  pwhich uses the binomial form of the euclidean distance xy2  x2  y2  2xy, which from what Ive read usually runs faster.

Negative 35037 pBackground... I have to build a new asp.net mvc app that uses an existing class library that is complex and cant be rewritten at this stage. The main problem is that this class library has a huge initialisation hit  it takes up to 10 mins to load all its data into memory. This is fine for production environment where it performs fast after IIS has started up. However, for development this is a nightmare because every time you build the solution and start it up in a browser, it takes ages.p  pPossible Solution So, the idea was that Castle Windsor or IOC lifestyle can be used to hold this in memory so that only recycling the application pool will force an expensive reload. I remember having a problem before when Windsor was keeping code in memory so even after changing it and recompiling, IIS still had the old code running  in this scenario it was a problem, but in my new scenario this is exactly what Id like.p  pAnyone know how this can be done I have tried with a dummy project using Singleton lifestyle but after changing the mvc project it still reloads the class library.p

Negative 35037 pI am writing a server that needs to serve a large number of clients. I am considering what is the best thread strategy to use I read that the codeThreadPoolcode class on the .NET Framework allocates threads after taking into account parameters like the number of cores the machine is running on, which is great. However, if there is no thread available, it waits for one to become available.p  pThe connections on my sockets may be fairly long, i.e. a thread may run for quite some time before it is done serving its client and terminating. Therefore, if I start a new thread for every socket, it is possible in theory for a large number of threads to be idle waiting for data on the socket, yet still considered to be running, and thus preventing the codeThreadPoolcode from allocating new threads, and serving other clients. On the other hand, using a predefined number of threads to serve all sockets does not make an optimal use of the machines multiple cores.p  pI am assuming there is a better way to do this... Any suggestionsp  pThank you.p

And again, that object ie. someLockObject is different for all requests under my assumption. p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2997438willlockstatementblockallthreadsintheproccessappdomainThisa answer, as well as a few others, implies that Im wrong about something.

Negative 35037 pIm writing a WPF user control which internally uses MVVM. In order to work outofthebox, it creates its own viewmodel this part is not relevant to the question.p  pMy control exposes a number of dependency properties. The host view whoever uses my control can set these DPs or bind to them. Some of these DPs have corresponding viewmodel properties.p  pThis is what I want to achieve see diagram the DPs in my controls view are bound to the corresponding properties of the viewmodel. Additionally, the host view needs to be able to set or bind these DPs, too  the same way you use any other control.p  pHowever, as soon as the host view sets or binds the DPs value, the original binding binding it internally to the controls viewmodel is lost. This is because every DP can only have a single binding set. So this doesnt workp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLnU56.png altDiagram of what doesnt workp  pOne solution is to make the viewmodel a DependencyObject and its properties DPs. This way, I could bind the controls viewmodel to its view rather than the other way around, effectively reversing the left arrow. However, for various reasons, I want my viewmodel to use plain C properties and INotifyPropertyChanged.p  pAny ideas on how to expose viewmodel properties as externally bindable dependency propertiesp  pemEditemp  pTo clarify on the requirements the view does not in fact create the viewmodel itself I realize that would violate the separation of concerns rather, it uses a viewmodel locator to do so. Its a terribly modular enterprise application. I know this is not a typical approach see Rachels answer. However, accepting the described setup, is there any way to achieve the desired resultp

Negative 35037 pIm using NAudios WaveStream and BlockAlignReductionStream to read data from MP3 files. it all works great using the Read method, which reads into a byte[] buffer, but Im wondering what happens when the format is different than 8bit PCM, or when theres more than 1 channelp  pI mean, it probably reads 16bit PCM format as the highorder byte first and than the loworder byte, so its basically a short. but what if there are 2 channels does it read from both one sample from the first and one sample from the other or the exact oposite... or what and does the same happen for 32bit float formatp  pThanks.p

Windows cannot be used as sometimes it may use the forms authentication, and UserName is out as it requires specifying the user name in code, which I will not be able to do. Is Certificate the right way to go Is this a certificate that contains the user identity or is it the certificate that is used to sign the messagep  pI cant seem to find any demonstration of how to pass through the credntials. The possibility that forms authentication may be used means impersonation is not possible.p  pIve looked through just about everything regrding WCF security but I have not seen this explained. Can anyone helpp

Negative 35037 pIn a cocoa application that Im writing, I want to create several different kinds of subclasses of NSMutableDictionary. I put that word in quotes because I know that the recommended way to add methods to classes such as NSMutableDictionary is to use categories.p  pHowever, this is creating a confusing situation for me.p  pI want each category of NSMutableDictionary to implement a run method that does different things, depending on which subclass Im referencing. For example, lets say I have the following 3 categoriesp  precodeNSMutableDictionaryCategory0 NSMutableDictionaryCategory1 NSMutableDictionaryCategory2 codepre  pIn each one, I want a run method that does, for example, the followingp  pIn category 0 ...p  precodevoidrun    NSLogIm running in NSMutableDictionaryCategory0  codepre  pIn category 1 ...p  precodevoidrun    NSLogIm running in NSMutableDictionaryCategory1  codepre  pIn category 2 ...p  precodevoidrun    NSLogIm running in NSMutableDictionaryCategory2  codepre  pWith these categories applied, I want to create an NSArray called, say, myObjects which contains a random mixture of the Category 0, Category 1, and Category 2 objects. Then, I want to do the followingp  precodefor NSMutableDictionary dict in myObjects    [dict run]  codepre  p... and have each of the categoryspecific run methods to be invoked.p  pUnless Im doing something wrong, I cant get this to work properly, because each category attempts to add a run method to NSMutableDictionary, and only one of those will be called. p  pIs what Im trying to do even possible If so, could someone point me to the appropriate docsp  pThanks in advance.p  hr  pThanks to Sean and Caleb. I was afraid that I wouldnt be able to do this, for the reasons you outlined, but I thought Id ask anyway, in case I was missing some knowledge about Objective C or cocoa that might help me.p  pI need the parent class to be an NSMutableDictionary for various applicationspecific reasons, so I will manage this as follows ...p  pIll create a category that adds a single run method to NSMutableDictionary. Ill use a special key in that dictionary to hold the instance of a new MyRunnable class with its own run method. Ill subclass this MyRunnable class for all the various run implementations I desire, and then Ill instantiate the appropriate subclass and put it in the NSMutableDictionary with this special key. Then, in the NSMutableDictionarys run method, Ill just reference the instance of MyRunnable via the special key and invoke its own run method.p  pThis is another form of containment which allows my toplevel class to still be an NSMutableDictionary.p  pThanks again.p

Negative 35037 pSo Im using the standardized track listing a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8608692howtousestandardizedtracklistingsinspotifyappsin this stackoverflow questiona, and which the guidelines instruct developers to use.p  pI can easily emremoveem fields from each entry in the track listing with css just displaynone, etc, and likewise alter the general appearance.  However, I would like to emaddem another field to each entry.p  pAs an example, see the Top Lists feature in your spotify client for me this is the second item under APPS.  These lists look mostly like normal playlists and of course, operate as such too, but each element has a number next to it, and the format is a little bit different.p  pWould it be possible to do this in my own application, without totally reinventing the wheelp  pI can do something like code.splist a.eachfunctionthis.appendfoocode  but that will only affect the currently visible tracksish.  If part of the playlist scrolls out of view, those tracks are not affected.  Also, if Spotify decides to redraw any part of the list, which emdoesem happen for example if I scroll the affected items out of view and play a track, I lose the change.  So this is not especially viableclean.p  pThoughtsp

This way, the user will be able to see on the calendar of the application, all the available days he has left in order to take action for each of his reminders.p  pI already have my array of reminders which I can access from the view. I was able to implement it properly thanks to guidance from a great fellow around here.p  pThis is my javascript function for the datepickerp  precodefunction              datepicker.datepicker                 flat true,                 numberOfMonths [1,1],                 dateFormat ddmmyy,                 beforeShowDay highlightDays              codepre  pThere is another function, namely, highlightDays which is the one that is causing me troublep  pIts parameter is the array reminders such that reminders[i].start  is the startDate, and reminders[i].end is the endDate of reminder i, with i  number of reminders in the array.p  precodefunction highlightDaysreminders              for var i  0 i lt reminders.length i                     Below                  If startDate is smaller than endDate,                  then highlight the days inbetween.                                    if new Datereminders[i].start.toString lt                      new Datereminders[i].end.toString                                   return [true, uistatehighlight]                                Otherwise do not highlight             return [true, ]          codepre  pThe problem is the calendar wont even show up when I open the application and log in. And the Apache Log or output do not show any errors. Id like to know, where do you think I might be wrong I will keep investigating, but Id really appreciate your input p  pP.D I can access the elements of the array of reminders endDate, startDate and print these dates on screen, so that means the reminders array is not empty.p  pThank you once again for taking the time to read.p

Negative 35037 pI have JSP page. In that page under HTML tags i have codeltinputgtcode tags.

Now when i execute query i get all the values in result set variable. I want these values to be send back again to codepage1.jspcode so that i can use them to set as values for my  tags. I want to know how should i do this. should i store each value from result set variable to a session variable and use them later, or should i return rs variable back to page 1 and set values in codeltinputgtcode tag like codeltrs.getIntStringgtcode.

Negative 35037 pI wrote a script to remotely fetch event logs in PowerShell, but Im not a fan of the way the script makes its own event log entries.p  pSpecifically this script grabs several types of event IDs including the logonlogoff events.  Recently I was asked to run the script to fetch events for another user, and had to have this data fetched in a few hours.  Normally I start the script and let it run for the majority of the day because there is usually a LOT of data here, but this time to speed up the process, I spun up 4 instances of the script to fetch this data faster than usual.  Each instance of the script was looking at a different time frame so that all 4 scripts combined were fetching in the time frame I had been asked for.  p  pOver the course of 3 hours or so, I had over a million different login attempts for my user ID on this remote computer.  I had so many logins that I ended up overwriting the event log data I was originally asked to fetch.  p  pLessons learned, Im now researching how to make this faster, more efficient, and more reliable.  p  pHeres the heart of my code, pretty plain and simple, and works for the most part.  p  precodeoutput  GetEventLog      instanceID 4672,4647,4634,4624,4625,4648,4675,4800,4801,4802,4803      logName Security      after GetDate inStartDate      before GetDate inEndDate.addDays1      message   InUserID        computerName inPCID codepre  pI guess there are several questions that I havent been able to figure out in my research thus far.  Why would GetEventLog need to make so many connections  Is it because the connection kept dropping or somethingp  pWhat would be the fastest way to fetch this data  Using the native codeGetEventLogcode command by specifying a codeComputerNamecode, or should I be using something like codeEnterPSSessioncode or codeInvokeCommandcode.  p  pWill codeEnterPSSessioncode and codeInvokeCommandcode both have the same problem Im having with codeGetEventLogcodep  pId like to avoid using codeEnterPSSessioncode and codeInvokeCommandcode for the simple fact that I cant guarantee all machines in the company will have remoteexecution enabled.  p
Negative 35037 pI am trying to calculate the number of combinations of sequences ArrayList that can be stacked, but each row cannot contain any of the elements that are contained in adjacent rows up to a specified HEIGHT. I have a list of lists, rowCombos global which are all the possible combinations of elements that can be in each row. My code should cycle through the rowCombos to see which row Combo can be placed on top of the proceeding row, following the contraints mentioned above. Once the panel reaches the HEIGHT input parameter, it should increment the counter, and then drop out of the recursive method. The issue Im running into is a stackOverflow and I have ran a debug to see where it is hanging up. It seems that each thread works its way through the method, and then hangs up on the consecutive recursive call...

Negative 35037 pImagine a cubeshaped piece of Swiss cheese. We model the cheese through a 20x20x20 grid. For simplicity, we assume that each grid cube consists entirely of cheese or entirely of air. On the upper side of our cube of Swiss cheese we then pour water, which penetrates the cheese only through the air holes in the cube. The water may flow through a continuous channel from the top to the bottom, but it may only flow from one air cube to the next, if the two cubes are connected through a face not just an edge or a corner. The water can also flow on detours such as in a sink drain trap, but it may not flow out on the side walls of the cheese cube.p  pNow let us programmaticaly implement that model of the Swiss cheese with a random distribution of air and cheese cubes as described above, with the probability of cheese empem and the probability of air em1  pem and simulate water flowing through the cheese in order to find out, whether the water flows through to the bottom of the Swiss cheese cube.p  pBy repeatedly simulating water flowing throught the Swiss cheese cube with different probabilities of cheese and air we can ascertain a relationship between p and the probability of water flowing through to the bottom of the Swiss cheese cube, lets name it emqem.

Negative 35037 pAt my work im assigned to a WPF project implemented using MVVM pattern. It has Views with zero codebehind, which is cool. It uses a datamodel generated by Entity Framework as the Model with some other classes, which i doubt to be a proper approach. But the thing that bugs me most is that it has the ViewModel as the thickest layer where all the business logic and applicationoperation code resides.  p  pNow im a novice in WPFMVVM, but my understanding about the MVVM pattern says that the ViewModel is ONLY supposed to provide with the means to the View so that it can consume the Model, which makes it the thinnest layer of all and my business logic and applicationoperation codes should reside somewhere else.  p  pId really appreciate if anyone can help me out. Am i right or wrong about the purpose of the ViewModel Should i put my business logic and applicationoperation codes somewhere else, or just consider the ViewModel as my Business Logic Layerp

Negative 35037 pIm a new iPhone dev and I integrated a team of iOS developper, in the domain of education. First, I thank you for your help.p  pHere is my question  The lead developper told that for the project iOS 5, they will not use Core Data to deal with the database of the app, but they will use their own SQLite libraries. I have been told by the lead dev that Core Data will not fit in that project, because of the data they are dealing with... No more detailsp  pSince Core Data uses SQLite, and so will the library they created, do you have any ideas why Core Data could be a problem in generalp  pI really thank you if you have any clue.p  pstrongEDIT strongp  pIve just learnt that the lead is creating an sqlite database and we are going to use it in the app. And the fields contains a lot of html a lot of special characters like  or amp or lt, and we are going to display it in some UIWebViews. Is he right when he says that those special characters can turn wrong with core data p

If codedepth  0code then it will just scan the elements in the first folder.  If codedepth gt 0code it will scan folders up until the specified depth.  None of that matters thought, because for whatever reason I dont have permission to read the file.  I have no idea what I am doing wrong.p  precodedef scanpathname, signatures, depth Recusively scans all the files contained in the folder pathname up until the specificed depth      Reconstruct this     if depth lt 0         return     elif depth  0         for item in os.listdirpathname             n  os.path.joinpathname, item             try                  List a directory on n                 scann, signatures, depth             except                  Do what you should for a file                 files  openn, r                 text  file.read                 for virus in signatures                     if text.findsignatures[virus] gt 0                         print, found virus .formatn, virus                 files.close codepre  pJust a quick editp  pThis code below does something very similar, but I cant control the depth.

Negative 35037 pConverting a PHPGTK application to Python, I need a dictionary which works as closely as possible as PHP arrays.

Negative 35037 pI am doing a project with a fairly powerful 32bit microcontroller, the STM32F4 with 192K RAM and 1024K Flash. I am using C. The system I wish to create consists of this controller Ill call it the host and a small module the client. p  pThe client simply contains a memory bank and an LED controller that both use the same data line I2C to connect to the host. The host can read from the memory and send commands to control the LED outputs on the client.p  pI want to be able to write code directly on the clients memory. Then at runtime, the host will pull the code from the client and run it  and the code will be limited to doing two thingsp  ul liManipulating variables in an arbitrary wayli liSending commands to the LED driver based on these variables.li ul  pI want these limitations so that anyone can write code for a client without being able to do something malicious to the host. I am looking for a way to run a scripting language interpreter on the microcontroller for this purpose. The code on the client would then be textformat and it would be interpreted on the host.p  pI have looked into eLua but it looks like it would require me to implement all of my C code on the host as Lua libraries, which I would like to avoid. Does anyone know of a solution where I can just interface to the I2C library and run simple scripts without too much painp  pIf not, is there something out there that I can build on to build this simple interpreter myselfp  pI can provide any clarification if needed.p

Negative 35037 pIm trying to chop a triangle off the bottom of a codedivcode by using the CSS codebordercode hack. Creating a 0 width and height object and giving it a big ol border and making one side of the border transparent and the other sides a solid color. p  pMy problem is that the codedivcode in question has a percentage width. Consequently my border needs to have a percentage width as well and possible height which is another potential problem as the codedivcode doesnt have a specified height. But, the css codeborderwidthcode property doesnt seem to support percentage values. p  pAlternative solutions to the problem of chopping a triangle off the bottom of a responsive codedivcode would also be okay. p  pBefore someone recommends using an image or appending one I cant because the whole thing has a pattern and it wouldnt match up.

Negative 35037 pIm quite new to asp.net and C so bear with me. Also my apologies if this have been asked before... if so please direct me to a page which is of help.p  pWhat I havep  ul lipA page  With 4 updatepanelsp  ol lip1st UpdatePanel which contains a item gridview, user display options not important to this question and button which perform a database search which returns a list of items displayed to the grid. User selects an item on this grid...pli lip2nd UpdatePanel contains a dropdownlist containing a list of available task loaded from an XML. User will select a task, which displays a bunch of available optionsparameters also loaded from XML file to another parameter gridview in 2nd updatepanel. Gridview here will always have one row of data. Im using gridview here because it is easier rather than creating dynamic controls paramaters are different to each task . User is able to enter parameter values into the grid. User clicks on an Add button and the the task is added to another gridview in the 3rd updatepanel. pli lip3rd UpdatePanel contains a task gridview which contains all the task added by user. Theres also a button which is suppose to batch run all the task. When the button is clicked, it goes through the task gridview looking for pending task to run. For each pending task, it calls a web service which handles the task appropriately. Web service returns the task result together with log output.pli lip4th UpdatedPanel for now just contains a div that displays the log output returned from web service.pli olli ul  pWhat I want to further work on and not know how isp  ul lihow do I perform an asynchronous batch job What im trying to achieve is that, when user clicks on the batch run button, the 3rd task updatepanel together with all its control get disabled while the batch jobs run behind the scene. Depending on the task, each task could take up to 5seconds each. If user had created 60 tasks, I would think this will also cause the page to timeout li liWhile the batch job is running, user can further search for other items in item UpdatePanel and add new tasks using parameter updatepanel to task updatepanel.li liTask UpdatePanel will be showing a Job in progress... overlay of some sort when job is running.li ul  pHope you understand my question.

Ill just update my own comments for now.p  pThanks for your suggestion. Sorry for the late response, Ive been looking around the other day and had made some changes, getting it to work with PageAsyncTask and IAsyncResult. Ive created a web service class which will be called by the page. The new web service class will than called the gSoap web service. Ive managed to some sort of running it asynchronously. p  pI have a button which executesp  precode  protected void StartASyncJob         PageAsyncTask task  new PageAsyncTask         new BeginEventHandlerBeginAsyncCommandTask,         new EndEventHandlerEndAsyncCommandTask,         new EndEventHandlerAsyncCommandTaskTimeOut, null       RegisterAsyncTasktask    codepre  pBeginAsyncCommandTask will go through the grid, get the first pending task and calls the web service.p  pEndAsyncCommandTask will then retrieve the return results, writes out the log UpdatePanel. It will then execute StartASyncJob again looking for the next pending record to process.p  pAll this works ONLY if dont do anything else on the page. If I was while the asynchronous process was running  to do a search for more items in item gridview or select a new task from  task dropdownlist, the event will not fire till the asynchronous web service process has completed. And when its completed, the dropdownlist or search event fires, my log details returned from the web service is not updated. p  pI guess the wait is caused by PageAsyncTask being spawn from the same page threadp  pI would have thought having the asynchronous web service will enable the user to do more than one thing at a time giving better user experience. But it seems Im wrong andor have not done it right.p  pI have not tried your suggestion of using QueueUserWorkItem but before I do, may i ask if it will give the same effect as using PageAsyncTask. Will using QueueUserWorkItem has the same effect of spawning from same page thread p  pMany thanks in advance. Sorry if ive not explained myself well and please do let me know if you need me to post my code.p

Negative 35037 pIm trying to get back into PHP and MySQL development since ive found out that MySQL now allows stored procedures. I work with these at work on an Oracle database and use PLSQL developer to create them. I was looking for a similar sort of interface for MySQL and was pointed in the direction of MySQL workbench. Im using Xampp as my test server setup and would like to link MySQL Workbench to MySQL on this server however Im stuck at one of the stages in the installation. Im trying to create a new server instance and have been successful as far as testing the database connection however on the next page it asks me to set the windows configuration parameters for this machine and failes to discover a MySQL service. I have ensured that both the Apache server and MySQL services are running in Xampp but do not understand why a MySQL service cannot be found and is not being displayed. Has anyone else encountered this issue when trying to use MySQL Workbench and if so, how did you amanage to get it up and running Im using Windows 8 and dont know if this is the reason a service isnt being found. I apologise if this is a really simple question with a simple answer however I have only ever used PHPMyAdmin before which is relatively simple to setup.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwaqsQ.jpg altNo service foundp

Negative 35037 pemPreamble I am quite new to HMACs, so please forgive me if the question is a little bit dumb.emp  pAs far as I understood, an HMAC is used to make sure that a message has not been tampered. So basically, it serves as a hash code. But, as the hash algorithm is known an attacker could easily calculate a new hash code for the tampered version of the message.p  pThis is what HMACs try to solve They provide a hash which is not only based upon the message that shall be hashed, but also on a cryptographic key. This way it is not possible to calculate a valid for the message without knowledge of the key.p  pIs this right so farp  pMy question now is What do we need HMACs for if we can achieve the same goal using public key signing IIRC signing works exactly the same way Calculate a hash and sign it to make sure that nobody tampered either the message or the hash.p  pSo whats the point of an HMACp

Negative 35037 pI have a Java application JDK 1.7.013 and am using java.net.HttpURLConnection to connect to some servlet based services that do session management.

Negative 35037 pI have a cocos2d iOS game that was originally built with direct images without spritesheets. I am migrating to spritesheets, and used Texture Packer to generate the spritesheets. I have several elements that are rendered next to each other, which worked fine in the initial nonspritesheet mode. Once I put those images in spritesheets, there is some flicker at the boundaries of the images. I have used extrude of 2 pixels with each spritesheet, and some of the flicker is eliminated, but there are still a couple. I have a few questionsp  ol liIs it possible that the flicker is due to ImageOptim being run on the images I dont think this is the problem, since I remember that even with optimized images, the flicker didnt occur.li liSome of the images that adjoin each other are in different spritesheets due to different RGB settings  could this cause the problem I could put the adjoining images into the same spritesheet, but that would cause a bit of overhead in terms of memory, since I may be putting, for example, an opaque image along with a translucent image with RGBA4444 instead of RGB565 for opaque. li liI am assuming that the rendering logic doesnt need to be changed. Is it possible that rendering the images to overlap as suggested by some responses to eliminate flicker might fix the issueli ol

Negative 35037 pIve got a WPF application that uses a codeDataGridcode control and is used by police officers in police cars.  I use merged dictionaries to implement Day and Night modes, where the color palette changes when you toggle the program between the two.  The application gathers data from special sensors my company makes and displays it for the officers.p  pThe codeDataGridcode in question is behaving oddly.  It is initially empty when the program first starts.  As data is collected, rows are added to the codeDataGridcode.  When you start the program, it is initially in Day mode.  The problem is that the background of the first row does not change to the night mode color for the control.  It stays white, which is the day mode color.  If you toggle back and forth between day mode and night mode, it stays white.p  pThis is different from any rows that are added to the codeDataGridcode after that one, which have the right color and switch back and forth between the colors properly.p  pHeres the style Ive defined in my App.xaml for the codeDataGridRowcode classp  precodeltApplication xClassMyApplication.App      . . .gt      ltApplication.Resourcesgt         ltResourceDictionarygt             ltResourceDictionary.MergedDictionariesgt                 ltResourceDictionary Sourcepackapplication,,,MyApplicationcomponentDayTime.xaml gt                  ltResourceDictionarygt                     . . .                     ltStyle TargetTypexType DataGridRowgt                     ltSetter PropertyBorderBrush     ValueDynamicResource DataBorder gt                     ltSetter PropertyBackground      ValueDynamicResource DataBackground gt                     ltSetter PropertyForeground      ValueDynamicResource DataForeground gt                 ltStyle.Triggersgt                     ltTrigger PropertyIsFocused ValueTruegt                         ltSetter PropertyBackground  ValueDynamicResource DataBackground gt                         ltSetter PropertyBorderBrush ValueDynamicResource DataBorderFocused gt                         ltSetter PropertyForeground  ValueDynamicResource DataForeground gt                     ltTriggergt                     ltTrigger PropertyIsKeyboardFocused ValueTruegt                         ltSetter PropertyBackground  ValueDynamicResource DataBackground gt                         ltSetter PropertyBorderBrush ValueDynamicResource DataBorderFocused gt                         ltSetter PropertyForeground  ValueDynamicResource DataForeground gt                     ltTriggergt                     ltTrigger PropertyIsSelected ValueTruegt                         ltSetter PropertyBackground  ValueDynamicResource DataBackgroundSelected gt                         ltSetter PropertyBorderBrush ValueDynamicResource DataBorderSelected gt                         ltSetter PropertyForeground  ValueDynamicResource DataForegroundSelected gt                     ltTriggergt                 ltStyle.Triggersgt             ltStylegt             . . .                 ltResourceDictionarygt             ltResourceDictionarygt         ltResourceDictionarygt     ltApplication.Resourcesgt ltApplicationgt codepre  pWhen I run Snoop on the program and drill down to the codeDataGridRowcode in question, the codeBackgroundcode propertys value is white FFFFFFFF and the Value Source for it is set to DefaultStyle.  This doesnt seem to be the style Ive defined, though, as it doesnt change when I toggle to day mode amp back to white.  I think its the default style defined by Microsoft and its not using my style at all.  But only on the first row inserted into the codeDataGridcode if it was initially empty.p  pFor subsequent rows, the Value Source column reads ParentTemplate.  This must be my style as the background colors do change properly as you toggle night mode.  p  pHow do I fix this so that every row in the codeDataGridcode is correctp  pEDITp  pIn the interests of completeness, heres the style used by the codeDataGridcode control, in case it helps.p  precodeltStyle TargetTypexType DataGridgt     ltSetter PropertyBackground

Negative 35037 pI did my best to look around the web but this problem eludes me. I have a stored procedure in SSIS that works fine. It does a bunch of stuff eventually returning some numbers and text. The procedure itself uses temp tables since the data does not need to exist beyond the proc run and returns 931K rows.p  pThe next step was to bring the output of the proc into excel. Using MS query, I call the proc including the necessary parameters. it runs but the only data I get back is the columns with numbers. I am missing the text values. I thought it might be a text translation issue from SSIS to Excel so I changed the output from nvarchar to varchar and the problem remains. I wrote the proc so I can make any changes necessary. Also, I thought that it might be a temp table issue so I tried building a table, inserting the data there using the proc then pull that table into Excel and while I got a few more text columns, a number were still blank.p  pAre there any suggestionsp  pShort version of the problem SQL works in management studio but text is not returned to excel. The number or rows from the proc match the number of rows in Excel when it is finished importingupdating. The numbers come back as expected.p  pVersionsp  pExcel 2007   SQL Server 2005  Management studio 2008R2  ODBC connection using MS query  p  precodeUSE [cmdb] GO  SET ANSINULLS ON GO SET

Negative 35037 pI am new to cassandra and now I am trying to make a production server. In documentation I read that data and commitlog should be on separated drives btw I use hdd, I tought the commitlog will increase to many Gb of data and I created 2 hard drives both 100Gb, on first will be data sstables on second commitlog. But now in config I see codecommitlogtotalspaceinmb 4096code, and I think this shoul be the maximum heap size. If commitlog reached this limit, then it seems that memtables increased in size and needs to be flushed to disk and also the data that was contained in memtables is removed from commitlog.p  pSo tell me please if am I right commitlog is like a backup of heap and cannot increase to hundreds of Gbp  pAnd I do not need to create 100Gb hard drive for that, will be enough a 4Gb partition on another hard drive, not the same where the data sstables is stored p  pThanxp

Negative 35037 pI am using Java and JSP to develop my web application.p  pThere are many situations in which user input cause an exception on server side, in this situation user expects an error message to be shown.  There are several ways that I as a programmer can handle the transfer of the error message from server to GUIhtml and maybe redirect to other pages and show the message there. One way to go is using session attribute, other can be ajax method calls and showing the response text. There may be other ways that I dont know.

Negative 35037 pMy app uses codeurban Airshipcode for its push notification.p  pThe problem starts when a user codeforce closescode the app by sliding it away in the multitasking window or in the settings. When a push arrives, it gets to urban airships receiver and they are broadcasting an intent for my app to use. So, if the app is forced closed then my receiver will not be activated and I cant receive the broadcast.p  pI know about codeIntent.FLAGINCLUDESTOPPEDPACKAGEScode  but I cant use it because urban is doing the broadcast and its in a jar file.p  pA fix could be that I keep my app in a running state all time, even if the user closes it. How can I do that I see that Whats app is doing that. Is there another solutionp  pP.S. I know that android is build in a way that when a user force closes an app he wants it to deactivate its receivers, but its not the same for push notification, push notification will still get through. I only want my app to live so I can receive the push. Thanksp

Sorry for my limited english.p  p In Case someone have this problem, i solved it using the nextp  pSupposing that you have a table row with two or more elements, put layoutwidth to matchparent, then the first element layoutweight to 1 and the second element to 2. This will fill the entire row with the two elements but the second one will be double size of the first one.

Negative 35037 pWe have binary files firmware which we want to version control, but which are created using tools that are incompatible with Subversions source code model.  For example, one of these binary files is the configuration file for a motor controller. I can run a script to put the version number in the right place using a script as part of the check in process, but I cannot put the Revision keyword there. There are other types of binary firmware files as well.p  pThe only solution Ive seen so far was just use the info from the svnversion command and add one. This doesnt guarantee the number is what subversion will record on check in, but it does make it distinct.p  pThe problem with this solution is finding the version again at a later date. e.g., this file has rev number 5164, but I can only find rev 5163 followed by 5198 in subversion. So which one is itp  pI understand we should change the source code, not the binary, but we cannot do this. As I said, these essentially are not compiled files. They must be tracked, preferably with embedded version numbers, but cannot be built.p

Negative 35037 pIm working on a Genetic Machine Learning project developed in .Net as opposed to Matlab  My Norm. Im no pro .net coder so excuse any noobish implementations.p  pThe project itself is huge so I wont bore you with the full details but basically a population of Artificial Neural Networks like decision trees are each evaluated on a problem domain that in this case uses a stream of sensory inputs. The top performers in the population are allowed to breed and produced offspring that inherit tendencies from both parents and the poor performers are killed off or breedout of the population. Evolution continues until an acceptable solution is found. Once found, the final evolved Network is extracted from the lab and placed in a lightweight realworld application. The technique can be used to develop very complex control solution that would be almost impossible or too time consuming to program normally, like automated Car driving, mechanical stability control, datacentre load balancing etc, etc.p  pAnyway, the project has been a huge success so far and is producing amazing results, but the only problem is the very slow performance once I move to larger datasets. Im hoping is just my code, so would really appreciate some expert help.p  pIn this project, convergence to a solution close to an ideal can often take around 7 days of processing Just making a little tweak to a parameter and waiting for results is just too painful.p  pBasically, multiple parallel threads need to read sequential sections of a very large dataset the data does not change once loaded. The dataset consists of around 300 to 1000 Doubles in a row and anything over 500k rows. As the dataset can exceed the .Net object limit of 2GB, it cant be stored in normal 2d array  The simplest way round this was to use a Generic List of single arrays.p  pThe parallel scalability seems to be a big limiting factor as running the code on a beast of a server with 32 Xeon cores that normally eats Big dataset for breakfast does not yield much of a performance gain over a Corei3 desktopp  pPerformance gains quickly dwindle away as the number of cores increases.p  pFrom profiling the code with my limited knowledge I get the impression that there is a huge amount of contention reading the dataset from multiple threads.p  pIve tried experimenting with different dataset implementations using Jagged arrays and various concurrent collections but to no avail.p  pIve knocked up a quick and dirty bit of code for benchmarking that is similar to the core implementation of the original and still exhibits the similar read performance issues and parallel scalability issues.p  pAny thoughts or suggestions would be much appreciated or confirmation that this is the best Im going to get.p  pMany thanksp  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Diagnostics using System.Threading.Tasks  Benchmark script to time how long it takes to read dataset per iteration  namespace BenchmarkSimple  class Program       public static TrainingDataSet DataSet     public static int Features  100 Real test will require 300     public static int Rows  200000 Real test will require 500K     public static int PopulationSize  500 Real test will require 1000     public static int Iterations  10     public static ListltNeuralNetworkgt NeuralNetworkPopulation  new ListltNeuralNetworkgt      static void Main              Stopwatch Stopwatch  new Stopwatch          Create Dataset         Console.WriteLineCreating Training DataSet         DataSet  new TrainingDataSetFeatures, Rows         Console.WriteLineFinished Creating Training DataSet          Create Neural Network Population         for int i  0 i lt PopulationSize  1 i                      NeuralNetworkPopulation.Addnew NeuralNetwork                   Main Loop         for int i  0 i lt Iterations  1 i                      Stopwatch.Restart              Parallel.ForEachNeuralNetworkPopulation, Network gt  EvaluateNetworkNetwork                Removed for simplicity               Run Evolutionary Genetic Algorithm on population  I.E.

Negative 35037 pI have to have a way to have four threads run from a certain point at roughly the same time. For examplep  precodethread 1  mov eax,ebx, mov ecx, edx, [S], mov eax, edx, ... thread 2  sbb eax,ebx, [S], mov ecx, edx, ... thread 3  mov eax,ebx, xchg eax,ebx, cmp edx, ecx, [S], mov eax, ebx, ... thread 4  dec eax, sub eax,ecx, [S], .... codepre  p[S] is a place holder for a synchronization point. After all threads have reached this point, they should start roughly at the same time. How do I do thisp  pThe code I have is something likep  precodenumberofthreads 4  temp       dd 0            a synchronization variable codepre  piTHREAD 1 codep  precodesynchronization [S]  lock add [temp],0x1 wloop1                  cmp [temp], numberofthreads  jne wloop1 codepre  piTHREAD 2 codeip  precodesynchronization [S]  lock add [temp],0x1 wloop2                  cmp [temp], numberofthreads  jne wloop2 codepre  piTHREAD 3 codeip  precodesynchronization [S]  lock add [temp],0x1 wloop3                  cmp [temp], numberofthreads  jne wloop3 codepre  pTHREAD 4 codeip  precodesynchronization [S]  lock add [temp],0x1 wloop4                  cmp [temp], numberofthreads  jne wloop4 codepre  pThis way we make sure that all threads reach [S] and start off from there at roughly the same time. The code that follows [S] executes only if temp becomes numberofthreads Is there a problem with this code such as race I am not even sure if this is the way to do this. p

At that time a framework was built for all of the classic ASP pages which are the majority but the ASP.Net apps were left looking the way the developer wrote them and are independent of the framework and I am the only developer here now.p  pWhat I am looking for is a way that I can construct a new framework based on the existing that classic ASP and ASP.net can both use without any problems.  I dont want to have to maintain two separate sets of code if I dont have to.p  pMost of the pages use the lt  script tags to embed vbscript and I have learned that those tags do not work in ASP.net.p  pSo far my feeble attempts to create this class has lead to errors and incompatibility. So before I waste any more time I thought I would throw this question out to the development community for advice.p

Negative 35037 pIve been looking for a css or javascriptjquery solution to make an effect where you hover over a thumbnail and the thumbnail zooms in, but doesnt resize past the original images bounds.

Negative 35037 pIt should be simple, but i just cant get anything to work.p  pMy Mac mini was connected to the office network Windows server and the repository is located on a server harddisk. I have a cloned working copy on the mac etc.p  pNow the Mac is sitting somewhere else and is connected to the server via VPN.

I can access the data and the repository.p  pI use sourcetree to access the git repository. In the bookmarks of sourcetree i can add it as a new repo and it says This is a Git repository. Now when i hit clone it says cloning from... all fine... except, it never ends. Watched this for 10 minutes, no network traffic, no file appears on the harddrive. waited longer... p  pWhen i cancel this, the following line appears Cloning into Users... and Completed with errors, see above but there is no error above.p  pNow i opened the existing clone with sourcetree and attempted to change the repo location but i just dont know what to enter. It now starts with SomeFolder... and that folder still exists but now its behind the VPN. So what do i enter  I tried some variations with IP etc but nothing worked and quite frankly im not getting along with mya mac.p  pI really dont care about sourcetree, if its best to use plain XCode, so be it, but i need something that works.p  pstrongUpdate 1strongp  pIm still having trouble. The answers with the SSH require a username, which one   A former colleague set up this mac for me. I have a VPN Username, a windomain user and an apple id... which of the 3 is meant in ur SSH lines p  pIt may sound trivial but, when i enter the git rep folder, do i have to end the line with a slash or not p  pIn the local network the rep folder just started with Data... so if i put an IP before that, does the IP need a slash before it as well  I mean, on windows i would know what to do and the only reason why i ask these silly questions is because none of it seems to work on the mac p

Negative 35037 pI have a few different angular modules that will share the same method. These modules dont really lend themselves to inheritance, but I want to remain DRY. Thus I wanted to use the mixin pattern. In the project Im working on, we are also using underscore js. Im trying to instantiate an angular module for my mixin as follows p  precodeangular.modulemy.module, []   .factorymyMixinFunction, function       .mixin       myMixinFunction function param           do something         return                codepre  pNow my question is, how do I load this mixin into another module Im thinking it would look something like this  p  precodeangular.modulesome.other.module, [my.module]   .factorymyOtherModule, function myMixinFunction         Other module code    codepre  pI know Ill have to list the mixin module as a dependency, but where do I actually perform the extension Ideally, I would like my mixin to be able to access the elements within myOtherModule. Anyone have any advice on this Is there an angular way to accomplish this p
Negative 35037 pIve downloaded the binary distribution for GHC 7.8RC1. It did a nice job installing separate ghcghcighcpkg binaries for 7.6 and 7.8. I can launch ghci and do wonderful things, and I can compile simple hello world files, but if I try to do anything that uses any libraries, etc it doesnt find them unsurprisingly.p  pIve done some googling and it doesnt seem obvious how I would go about messing with larger projects compiled with 7.8, and even more strangely I dont find others asking the question. Maybe Ive missed something obvious Im a Haskell noob, but there are some things that require 7.8 that Im keen to experiment with.p  pIm running OS X Mavericks with Xcode 5 which I understand causes some trouble, but Ive worked around the things so far by installing gcc 4.8 and referencing it as necessary.p

Negative 35037 pSo in the included image, you can see a copy of the website Im currently working on. The site is going to have separate pages for each of the companys machines.

Negative 35037 pLets consider a fairly simple hypothetical application where users can read or write posts.p  pSome users can read and write articles while some others can only read them. With Spring Security 3.2.1 I modeled this by having 2 rolesp  ul liROLEWRITE this role grants users access to writing posts.li liROLEREAD this role grants users access to reading posts.li ul  pImplementing this with Spring security is fairly straightforward...p  pNow I want to also allow thirdparty apps to read and write posts on behalf of users by implementing an OAuth2 provider using a hrefhttpsgithub.comspringprojectsspringsecurityoauthSpring Security OAuth version 2.0.0.M3 ATMa.p  pDuring the authorization step, the app asks the user whether they are willing to grant the right to read andor write posts on their behalf. The user here is granting scopes here not roles.p  pThen when the OAuth2 consumer calls my REST API, Spring Sec OAuth authorizes the token granted and creates an authentication containing the user with all their roles and only the scopes granted.p  pThe problem and the question is that I now have to write different security logic depending on whether the API is called by a user normally authenticated just check the roles or whether its called through OAuth2 check roles  scopes.p  pIs it possible to merge the concepts of roles and scopes in Spring Security OAuth2 so that during the authorization step, the user grants the app a subset of the strongrolesstrong they have and have the OAuth2 authentication only report these in the granted authorities That way when the 3rd party app makes an API call, the roles on the authentication are the ones granted That way I dont have to write any OAuth2 specific security logic.p

I tried do it using excellent Hamcrest matching classes, by combining contains with codeMatchers.hasToStringcode, but somehow, its codeMatchers.containscode is not being able to match an item even though it is present in the collection.p  pHeres an examplep  precodeclass Item       private String name      public ItemString name         this.name  name           public String toString         return name         heres a sample collection, with the desired item added in the end CollectionltItemgt items  new LinkedListltItemgt      addnew Itema      addnew Itemb     addnew Itemc    Assert.assertThatitems, Matchers.containsMatchers.hasToStringc codepre  pThe above assertion is not successful.

Hamcrest javadoc for Matchers.contains saysp  pCreates a matcher for Iterables that matches when a single pass over the examined Iterable yields a single item that satisfies the specified matcher. For a positive match, the examined iterable must only yield one itemp  pAm I doing something wrongp
Negative 35037 pI noticed that batch insert using codeMongoTemplate.insertCollectionltgt code method is much slower than using MongoDB Java driver.p  pAs far as I understand it, the differences comes from the fact that the MongoTemplate is performing some serial operations and Im talking about the next lines of code p  precodefor T o  batchToSave     initializeVersionPropertyo   BasicDBObject dbDoc  new BasicDBObject    maybeEmitEventnew BeforeConvertEventltTgto   writer.writeo, dbDoc    maybeEmitEventnew BeforeSaveEventltTgto, dbDoc   dbObjectList.adddbDoc  codepre  pAnd p  precodefor T obj  batchToSave    if i lt ids.size      populateIdIfNecessaryobj, ids.geti     maybeEmitEventnew AfterSaveEventltTgtobj, dbObjectList.geti      i  codepre  pNow, is there a way to configure codeMongoTemplatecode to a void those heavy time consuming operations, maybe not publishing events or somethingp

Negative 35037 pI have seen several threads on how to make changes to UI elements from a background worker, but my problem is with the opposite process. I have a ListView which contains a number of items with check boxes next to them. I have a backgroundworker that should write out data to a csv for the items that are checked in the ListView. My problem is that I am unable to access the ListView.CheckedItems list which is stored on my main form. Is there an elegant way to access this data from the backgroundworker, or do I have to use some terrible workaround where I store the list in the arguments of the EventArgs parameterp  pAs an example, the following code would create a directory for every checked entry if there were no crossthreading problemsp  precodeprivate void WriteToCSVDictionaryltstring,PointPairListgt curves          foreach KeyValuePairltstring, PointPairListgt entry in curves                      if SaveListView.CheckedItems.ContainsKeyentry.Key                              string curveDir  Path.Combinethis.dirString, entry.Key                 if Directory.ExistscurveDir                                      Directory.CreateDirectorycurveDir                                             codepre  pSo the issue is, if this method is called from a backgroundworker, and SaveListView is a listview on the main form, how can I access SaveListView without raising a crossthreading exceptionp  pThank you for anything you can do.p

Negative 35037 pIn a Scala typeclass, there will be a trait on which operations are defined, e.g. codeNumberLikecode with codepluscode and codeminuscode, codeTransformercode with codetransformcode, or codeAddressLabelMakercode with codetoLabelcode. Its then possible to extend the trait with typeclass members.p  pTypically the operations will have the same number of parameters for different members, i.e. the signatures will look very similar. My question is what happens if a member needs what is essentially the same operation, but with an extra parameter maybe just an implicit one something that modifies the operation based on the context p  pIs there a way to do this without defining a whole new similar typeclassp

Manual increase of reference counter of stdsharedptr would have helped, but as I understand correctly there is no such an ability too.p  pThought of using stduniqueptr in addition to the raw pointer leaving the code as is and just calling release each time the raw pointer is passed to the function that takes ownership, but it is a very muddy solution.p  pI wonder if there is a smart pointer from the standard library that fit for my goals, or maybe there is an ideom or common trick how to do in my case or may I missing somethingp
Negative 35037 pI want to write a strongteststrong for the following method p  precodepublic void addItemItem item       items.add0, item     DatabaseHelper.getInstance.writeOneItemitem  codepre  pThe class is called ItemManager and its responsibility is to manage Items that the user can save to or remove from a list. It should be kept in sync with an Sqlite database that persists the items on the list. p  pWhen the codeDatabaseHelpercode ormlite is not inited with codeinitContext contextcode which is usually sone when my Andoid app starts, but is not done in my test, its codegetInstancecode method will return codenullcode and the method execution from above will crash. p  pWhat should I do here I could just call codeinitContext contextcode from my test or check if codeDatabaseManager.getInstancecode is null before calling anything on it. But that seems more like a workaround. It seems to me like I shouldnt do any Database stuff in this method and try to seperate the ItemManager from the Database as much as possible. p  pAny ideas on how the ideal solution would look, not in form of a concrete implementation but from a gerneral design standpoint p  pIm new to unit testing and having a hard time decoupling stuff from each other. p

Negative 35037 pI have a program used by my company written by a 3rd party that does not expose an API. That vendor has  no plans to ever add one.  The program uses SQL Server for the back end data store.  It would be extremely beneficial to be able to add records to the database for integrating into new applications.  p  pEvery table in this database has a primary key column called Id, its a nvarchar12 data type and by using SQL Server Profiler, I have determined that this value is generated by the source code, not by anything inside SQL Server.  From some free decompilers I have tried, it appears much of the software was written in VB6.  It also appears that the primary keys are somewhat related to time, and I say this because an order by on the Id column always yields the same order as the CreatedOn date.p  pHere are some examples of the primary key valuesp  precode5RN0PZ36TWM 5RN0Q036UAZ 5RN0Q136V20 5RN0Q136VF3 5RN0Q236VS6 5RN0Q236W5O 5RN0Q336WIR 5RN0Q336WW9 5RN0Q436X9S 5RN0Q436XMU 5RN0Q536Y0D 5RN0Q536YDV codepre  pThey are always alphanumeric and A is greater than 9.  Also, the Id values are usually between 9 and 12 characters long.p  pBasically, I want to know if anyone has seen a method in VB6 that will return a value in this type of format, or maybe another unique key generator used in VB6.  I am using C to write my programs so if there is another way to duplicate this type of value in C, that would be nice to know also.  p

Negative 35037 pBeing new to relational database design, I am trying to clarify one piece of information to properly design this database. Although I am using Filemaker as the platform, I believe this is a universal question.p  pUsing the logic of ideally having all one to many relationships, and using separate tables or join tables to solve these.p  pI have a database with multiple products, made by multiple brands, in multiple product categories. I also want this to be as scaleable as possible when it comes to reporting, being able to slice and dice the data in as many ways as possible since the needs of the users are constantly changing.p  pSo when I ask the question Does each Brand have multiple products I get a yes, and Does each product have multiple brands the answer is no. So this is a one to many relationship, but it also seems that a selfjoin table might give me everything that I need.p  pThis methodology also seems to go down a rabbit hole for other product related information such as product category, each product is tied to one product category, but only one product category is related to a product.p  pSo I see 2 possibilities, make three tables and join them with primary and foreign keys, one for Brand, one for Product Category, and one for Products.p  pOr the second possibility is to create one table that has the brand and product category and product info all in one table since they are all product related and simply do selfjoins and other query based tables to give me the future reporting requirements that will be changing over time.p  pI am looking for input from experiences that might point me in the right direction.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 35037 pIve just started using System.IO.Compression in .NET 4.5, and found a problem. It stores the files with a local modification time, not Universal UTC time.p  pSo if you zip files in one time zone and unzip them in another, it uses the local modification time say 1 PM from the original file, and extracts the file with the same modification time also 1 PM, even though it should be hours earlier or later.p  pI assume the same problem would exist with files zipped in Standard Time or Daylight Savings Time, and unzipped later in the other.p  pIt appears that there is a missing setting during zipping, since other methods of unzipping WinZip, compressed folder extract produce the same wrong modification time.p  pIve tested using WinZip to zip and unzip files in different time zones, and it doesnt have this problem. It must use UTC internally for the modification times.p  pIs there any way around this other than building my own timeshifting routines during Zip and Unzipp  pThis project cant use any external apps or libraries.

Ive posted the before and after below, and I was wondering if more experienced eyes could give it a once over and explain why the change I made fixed the problem I described.p  pBefore Fixp  precodebool deleteNodeNode ampheadRef, int delVal      Node delPtr  for use in deletion     Node scan                                 Node prev                                  if headRef  nullptr            if headRefgtdata  delVal                delPtr  headRef             headRef  headRefgtnext             delete delPtr           else               scan  headRefgtnext             prev  headRef              while scan  nullptr ampamp scangtdata  delVal                    scan  scangtnext                 prev  prevgtnext                           if scangtdata  delVal                    delPtr  scan                 prevgtnext  delPtrgtnext                 delete delPtr               else return false                   return true  codepre  pAfter Changes have been markedp  precodebool deleteNodeNode ampheadRef, int delVal      Node delPtr  for use in deletion     Node scan                                 Node prev                                  if headRef  nullptr           CHANGE 1         return false      if headRefgtdata  delVal            delPtr  headRef         headRef  headRefgtnext         delete delPtr       else           scan  headRefgtnext         prev  headRef          while scan  nullptr ampamp scangtdata  delVal                scan  scangtnext             prev  prevgtnext                   if scan  nullptr         CHANGE 2              delPtr  scan             prevgtnext  delPtrgtnext             delete delPtr           else return false          return true  codepre  pThanks in advanced for your help.p

Negative 35037 pI was facing a problem with WebViews where the WebView core threads would not stop even after the activityfragment ondestroy was called. To solve the problem I would call webview.destroy explicitly in the ondestroy of the fragment. I read the documentation about the destroy method. p  pa hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwebkitWebView.htmldestroy2829 relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidwebkitWebView.htmldestroy2829ap  pThe documentation says This method should be called after this WebView has been removed from the view system. Does it mean that I have to remove the WebView from the parent view that holds the WebView before I call the destroy Since I am calling the webview.destroy in the onDestroy of the frag and since onDestroyView would have been called do I need to remove the webview from its parentp

Negative 35037 pSorry guys, I am new comer to this website and I am not familiar with it. I have posted this question yesterday but with poor titles and code format. The following is the better.p  pI got an executable program which called dtmwin32. I want to use java program to run it. Normally, this executable program needs at least 20 minutes to run and it has a big output string in command line. Following is my java code fragment  the try catch block is hiddenp  precodeString command  dtmwin32 ntopics 20 ...      Please note that the command is too long to show its complete format. So I dont show the complete format here and its not relevant to solving this question. Process process  Runtime.getRuntime.execcommand BufferedReader br  new BufferedReadernew InputstreamReaderprocess.getInputStream String s while s  br.readLine  null      System.out.printlns      br.close     process.waitFor codepre  pMy OS is windows 7 and my jdk is jdk1.7.051.p  pI got an interesting problem The java program starts dtmwin32 successfully, however, I cant see anything to print and the dtmwin32 seems to be blocked. So I terminate the java program. To my surprise, at the moment I terminate my java program, dtmwin32 resume to run normally I have tried to run it many times but the occasion still happens. Is their anyone who meet the similar problem beforep

Negative 35037 pSo i have to make a java program that will increment and print each date from the date the user input. I can not get it to actually print increment. What do I have wrong.  I have already turned in what I have since it was due but still would like to resolve problem. i would love to use JOptionPane also but I am very bad at this. Its my first time. p  pinstructions Create a program called Date.java to perform errorchecking on the initial values, for instance fields month, day, and year. Also, provide a method nextDay to increment the day by one. The Date object should always remain in a consistent state.p  pWrite a program called DateTest.java that prompts the user to enter the month, day, and year as numeric values. This program then creates a Date object using the Date class you just created and tests the nextDay method. This can be done in a loop of 40 iterations the Date object calls the nextDay method and prints the date during each iteration of the loop. This loop is to illustrate that the nextDay method works correctly. Test the following casesp  pIncrementing into the next month, for example, use date 02282011 Incrementing into the next year, for example, use date 11272011 Incrementing into the next month in a leap year, for example, use date 02282012 Sample Program Outputp  pChecking increment  Date object constructor for date 11272011  Incremented Date11282011  Incremented Date11292011  Incremented Date11302011  Day 31 invalid.

Negative 35037 pPardon me if the answer already exists  I have searched as well as I could to no avail, though, with every search phrase I can think of. If the answer to this question already exits, it is not for lack of trying that I was unable to find it.p  pAnyway  here is my question. Lets say and we are talking about emgitem here there is a remote clone of the same repository that my local repository is cloned from  only there is a branch present on that remote clone that isnt present in my clone. Is there a way to import that remote branch into my local copy NOTE I dont want to merge it with the current branch or anything like that. I just want to start a local copy of that very same branch which has everything in it that the remote copy has. Is there a way to do thisp  pOnce again  the remote branch I am referring to is emnotem the default one that my local clone checksin with, but a separate one i.e., one whos URL I will need to specify on the command line.p  pThanks.p  pBy the way  I would also like to know once this is done how to get said branch added also to the default remotecopy that my local clone emdoesem check in with by default  but if necessary, I can ask a separate question for that  so please, if you can only answer one of these two questions, answer the first one.p

Negative 35037 pI cant figure out how to get to the object representing the Push Plugin.p  pIt would seem like different instructions where givven at different times and I am not sure what am I supposed to do now.p  pI am using phonegap Build with phonegap version 3.6.3 and the 2.4.0 version of the a hrefhttpsbuild.phonegap.complugins1199 relnofollowpush pluginap  pI have read the docs for a hrefhttpdocs.build.phonegap.comenUSconfiguringplugins.md.htmlPlugins relnofollowusing pluginsa and still am not sure if I should have some script to include the Push plugin in my code or not.p  pI have looked into the generated .apk file and it has the cordovaplugins.js file which includes descriptor for this plugin along with several others and by the look of this code I believe that Cordoba is loading the plugin automatically and nothing is required of mo in addition including the codecordova.jscode file. [but I could be wrong].p  pHow should I access the plugin is it just in a PushPlugin variable or in window.plugins cordova.pluginsp  pand most important is there a way to list the loaded plugins and their entry points programaticalyp

I also deleted codeapp.yamlcodeand codedockerfilecodeand the problem still persists. I also tried creating a new project shelf template project but was still not able to see the source code when the editor breaks on a breakpoint in imported code. p
Negative 35037 pMy Wildfly resteasy service is working fine, or was until I made a code change. No big deal, now Im getting a deserialization error codeProblem deserializing setterless property ...code p  pMy question is whether there is anyway to get an error message in the client. Im getting a Status of 400, and I can test that, but Id like to get any message if possible. Any ideasp  pIf I get an error in the user code, I can set an error message in the header, but since there is a deserialization problem, the server is throwing a error before getting to any user code.p
Negative 35037 pim currently doing a query that pulls a string from my db. but it has to check for every new row i import. and a file of 100k takes almost 4 hours to import. thats way too long. im assuming that my sql code to check if he exist is the thing slowing it down. ive heard about indexing but i have no clue what it is or how to use it.p  pthis is the current code im usingp  precodesql2  pdogtprepareSELECT  FROM prospects WHERE ssn  ssn sql2gtexecutearrayssn gt ssn ifsql2gtfetchPDOFETCHNUM gt 0 codepre  pso everytime the phpscript reads a new row, it does this check. problem is, that i cant put it in on duplicate key in the sql code. it has to check before going to any sql, because if this is empty, then it should continue doing its thing.p  pwhat could i do to make this more efficient regarding time and also, if index is the way to go, could someone enlighten me how this would be done by either posting examples, linking a guide or php.net page. and how i could read from that index to do what i am in my codep

Negative 35037 pHere is the scenariop  pIn the Wix install script for our application , start menu shortcuts and desktop shortcuts are now handled differently than before.p  pThese changes causes any user pinned shortcut to the application on the taskbar to be orphaned when a user runs an update from a previous installation. In other words, the shortcut remains but is no longer pointing to anything. p  pThe shortcut is shown as a blank page indicating that the link has been removed. A quick peek at the emCUsers[UserName]AppDataRoamingMicrosoftInternet ExplorerQuick LaunchUser PinnedTaskBarem folder confirms this. Clicking on the shortcut will remove it and then show a windows dialog asking whether to remove the shortcut or not answer has no meaning since it has already been removed.p  pMy question isp  pIs there any way to tell the taskbar to remove orphaned shortcuts p  pPreferrably this would be triggered by a custom action in the Wix script after installing the new version. p

Negative 35037 pI try to simplify my question. If all nodes in Neo4jDB have same label codeSciencecode, whats the difference between codeMATCH n WHERE n.IDUUID0001 RETURN ncode and codeMATCH nScience WHERE n.IDUUID0001 RETURN ncode. Why the performance is not the samep  pMy Neo4j database contains about 70000 nodes and 100 relations.p  pThe nodes have two types codePapercode and codeAuthorcode, and they both have an codeIDcode field.p  pI created each node with corresponding label, and I also use codeIDcode as the index.p  pHowever, since one of my functions need to query nodes by ID without considering the label. The query just like codeMATCH n WHERE n.IDUUID0001 RETURN ncode. The query time cost about code40005000 mscodep  pBut after adding codeSciencecode for each node and using codeMATCH nScience WHERE n.IDUUID0001 RETURN ncode. The query time became about 10001100 ms. Does anyone know the difference between these two casesp  pemPS. CountnScience  CountnPaper  CountnAuthor, which mean each node has two labels.emp

Negative 35037 pI am trying to create a monitor of messages between two applications. The idea is this monitor works in the middle of simple clientserver application, and log the messages to the standard output. This program must be against of fails of the clientserver disconnections, time outs, etc. In the code, i call the client as origin and the server as destiny. The current problem is when the server dies my program doesnt know and when a new message from client comes, this error appears Software caused connection abort socket write error. When the server comes up to life again, this error continues persisting. I think when i ask in the code if  socketToDestiny.isConnected , it is not really connected. I am sure the problem is how i manage the close at the stream too.p  pThis is the code of the program, i hope you could help me.p  precodepackage interceptorprocess  import java.io.DataInputStream import java.io.DataOutputStream import java.io.IOException import java.net.InetSocketAddress import java.net.ServerSocket import java.net.Socket import java.net.SocketException import java.net.SocketTimeoutException   public class GenericInterceptorProcess implements Runnable  private final String prefixlogmessages  [CONNECTOR]  COMMUNICATIONS ORIGINS VARIABLES ServerSocket serverSocketLocal Socket socketForLocal DataInputStream streamFromOrigin DataOutputStream streamToOrigen int lenmessagefromorigen byte[] buffermsgorigin  new byte[4096] byte[] messageorigin  null  COMMUNICATIONS DESTINYS VARIABLES Socket socketToDestiny DataInputStream streamFromDestiny DataOutputStream streamToDestiny int lenmessagefromdestiny byte[] buffermsgdestiny  new byte[4096] byte[] messagedestiny  Override public void run       OCCASIONAL USE     String aux      try              loggerSTARTING SERVER  PORT NUMBER   1234          CREATING THE LOCAL SERVER SOCKET         serverSocketLocal  new ServerSocket1234          CREATING THE DESTINITY CONNECTION WITH 15 TIMEOUTS SECONDS         socketToDestiny  new Socket         socketToDestiny.setSoTimeout15000          THIS LOOP MAINTAINS THE CONNECTIVITY WITH ONE CLIENT AT TIME         while  true                       loggerWAITING FOR A CONNECTION OF A CLIENT...             socketForLocal  serverSocketLocal.accept              CREATING THE ORIGINS STREAMS             streamFromOrigin  new DataInputStreamsocketForLocal.getInputStream             streamToOrigen  new DataOutputStreamsocketForLocal.getOutputStream              loggerCONNECTED CLIENT   socketForLocal.getRemoteSocketAddress               THIS LOOP MAINTAINS THE MESSAGESS CHANGES             while  true                               loggerWAITING FOR A MESSAGE..                 lenmessagefromorigen  streamFromOrigin.readbuffermsgorigin                  if  lenmessagefromorigen lt 0                                       closeOriginStream                     break                                   messageorigin  new byte[lenmessagefromorigen]                  SAVE THE ORIGINS MESSAGE INTO AN ARRAY WHO HAS THE EXACT SIZE OF THIS MESSAGE                 System.arraycopybuffermsgorigin, 0, messageorigin, 0, lenmessagefromorigen                  aux  new Stringmessageorigin                 loggerRECEIVED MESSAGE FROM ORIGIN   aux                  TRY TO CONNECT TO DESTINY                 try                                      if  socketToDestiny.isConnected                          socketToDestiny.connectnew InetSocketAddress10.10.200.200,1234,5000                                  catchIOException ex                                      loggerCONNECTION REJECTED BY DESTINY   ex.getMessage                     continue                                   CREATING THE DESTINYS STREAMS                 streamFromDestiny  new DataInputStreamsocketToDestiny.getInputStream                 streamToDestiny  new DataOutputStreamsocketToDestiny.getOutputStream                  loggerSENDING MESSAGE TO DESTINY   aux                  I HAD TO PUT THIS BLOCK BECAUSE IF THE DESTINY APPLICATIONS FAILS                 OR NOT ANSWER, THE PROGRAM MUST KEEP LISTENING THE FOLLOWING MESSAGES                 try                                      SENDING MESSAGE TO DESTINY                     streamToDestiny.writemessageorigin                      READING THE ANSWER MESSAGE                     loggerREADING MESSAGE FROM DESTINY...                      lenmessagefromdestiny  streamFromDestiny.readbuffermsgdestiny                                   IN ONE OF THE FOLLOWINGS TWO CATCHS I GET THE ERROR                  catch SocketTimeoutException ex                                      loggerIT DIDNT COULD RETRIEVE A MESSAGE FROM DESTINY   ex.getMessage                     continue                                  catch SocketException ex                                      THE socketToDestiny.isConnected ALWAYS RETURNS TRUE SINCE THE FIRST SUCCESSFULLY                      CONNECTION, AFTER THAT, IF THE SOCKET IS DISCONNECTED, IT REMAINS RETURNING true.

Negative 35037 pIm having a problem where a the colours in a custom cursor are sometimes not displaying correctly.p  pI have a Windows Forms application and on one of the forms there is a PictureBox control. When an image is loaded into that PictureBox and the mouse is moved over that control I want to display a custom cursor. This cursor is a little unusual in that for each image thats loaded into the PictureBox theres another associated image, and as the user moves the mouse pointer over the PictureBox control I want the cursor to be a square and within that square I want it to display the corresponding pixels from the associated image. Within certain limits, the size of the cursor may be changed by the user.p  pIn principle Ive nearly got it to work. Certainly at any given point the cursor is showing the right part of the associated image and it updates properly as I move the pointer around.p  pThe problem is that the colours being displayed in the cursor are not always correct. Theyre in the right ballpark a shade of red will always display as a shade of red for instance, just not necessarily the right shade. Sometimes the cursor colours look slightly darker, other times slightly lighter. Ive noticed that for any colours where all three of the R, G and B components are a combination of 0 or 255, the colours always look correct.p  pIn addition, this only happens if the cursor is a 64x64 pixel square or smaller. If the user increases the size of the cursor beyond that point the problem disappears, though it will reappear if the cursor size is later reduced back to 64x64 or smaller.p  pThis is the code which does the work. X and Y come from the MouseMove event. CursorSize is a formwide int variable which holds the size of the cursor in pixels always an even number and imgAssoc is a formwide Image variable into which the associated image was loaded. picMain is the PictureBox control.p  precode    private void LoadCursorFromBitmapint X, int Y              int halfSize  CursorSize  2           The new cursor image is a [CursorSize] x [CursorSize] pixel square.         using Bitmap bmp  new BitmapCursorSize, CursorSize                      using Graphics g  Graphics.FromImagebmp                               Create a [CursorSize] x [CursorSize] pixel square, centered on the X and Y coordinates.

I have no experience with iBeacons, beacons or anything BLE related so please forgive my ignorance here.p  pstrongProblemstrong I want to use my Mac Bluetooth and send a BLE notification to my iPhone and my Android phones think of the Starbucks app and how it sends you a Beacon. Question is Is it possible for my iOS SDK  Android SDK is there any kind of delegate or API that will receive my BLE notification and open a specific app based on that In other words, my Mac would send a simple Beacon UDID and my phone should launch my app based on that. And what libraries I use ruby, but could do PHP, Python, anything on the Mac side that would allow me to do that on both endsp
Negative 35037 pI know how to configure IIS to run multiple web sites when working on a local workstation but what I dont know how to do is setup the server so that each of us there are 4 of us can point our browsers to webapp1.com, webapp2.com, webapp3.com and have the server serve up the correct site. For exmaple, in Apache, you modify the http.conf file and setup rules.

Negative 35037 pstrongTLDRstrong emIm trying to find the most effective to dynamically create an implementation of a functional interface that forwards calls to a set of instances of that interface.emp  pThe goal is to simplify the implementation of interfaces which allow client code to register themselves for multiple events by passing a handler implemented as a functional interface to the appropriate registration function. An examplep  precode The interface in question we want to implement with minimal effort.  interface TrainStation      void onTranArrivedTrainArrivedHandler handler      void onPassengerArrivedPassengerArrivedHandler handler      interface TrainArrivedHandler          void applyString track, String lineNumber           interface PassengerArrivedHandler          void applyString track       codepre  pThis may be one example of such an interface. There would be many such interfaces, each with different events, so the implementation should be as simple as possible, without much duplicate code. I imagine that this may best be possible by introducing a type codeEventcode for internal use in such an implementation, which allows forwarding calls to all registered handlersp  precode Used in an implementation to implement on functions.  interface EventltHANDLERgt       Register a handler.      void onHANDLER handler       Returned instance calls all registered handlers.      HANDLER getMasterHandler      static ltHANDLERgt EventltHANDLERgt create           Magic. May need an instance of ClassltHANDLERgt, which is okay.       codepre  pAn implementation of codeTrainStationcode could then look like thisp  precodefinal class TrainStationImpl implements TrainStation      private final EventltTrainArrivedHandlergt trainArrivedEvent  Event.create     private final EventltPassengerArrivedHandlergt passengerArrivedEvent  Event.create      Override     public void onTranArrivedTrainArrivedHandler handler          trainArrivedEvent.onhandler           Override     public void onPassengerArrivedPassengerArrivedHandler handler          passengerArrivedEvent.onhandler            Generates some events.      public void makeSomethingHappen          trainArrivedEvent.getMasterHandler.apply34, S12         passengerArrivedEvent.getMasterHandler.apply2  Wants to catch the S12, but is obviously too late now.       codepre  pThis is a manageable level of required code. The bulk of it can be extracted to an abstract class and thus is only necessary once per interface. Of course, any way to reduce it is a plus but I cant see a straightforward way without exposing the codeEventcode instances.p  pGoing forward with this approach, the interesting thing is the implementation of the interface codeEventcode. I can certainly imagine doing it with plain old reflection, which has acceptable but not really outstanding performing. But I reckon that with Java 1.7 or 1.8 there should now be a more efficient andor more straightforward way to implement the return value of codeEvent.getMasterHandlercode using the new APIs, especially codeMethodHandlecode, since we know that each handler interface is a functional interface. How would I go about doing thisp

Negative 35037 pIve got a C library that Ive written a lot of unit tests for. The library is a data access layer library and requires SQL Servers fulltext indexing capabilities, which means LocalDb will not work. The unit tests are connecting to a local SQL Server instance. The project has an codeIDatabaseInitializercode that drops and recreates the database for each test, so each test has a fresh set of data to assume it can work against, meaning each test is capable of running on its own  no ordering needed.p  pA problem that Ive had since day one on this, but never tackled yet, is that if I simply run all of the tests at once, some will fail. If I go back and run those tests individually then they succeed. Its not always the same tests that fail when I run all at once.p  pIve assumed that this is because theyre all running so quickly and against the same database. Perhaps the database is not properly deleting and recreating before the next test runs. On top of just a simple database, Ive also got a SQL Server fulltext index that some of my tests require in order to pass. The fulltext index populates in the background and therefore is not ready immediately after populating the test databases tables. The fulltext index may take a second or two to build. This causes my tests that target the fulltext index to always fail, unless I step through the initializer in a debugger and pause a few seconds while the fulltext index builds.p  pMy question is, is there any way to avoid this clashing of database rebuilds As a bonus, is there a way to slow down the tests that need the fulltext index, so that it has time to populatep

Negative 35037 pSo we have code that looks something like thisp  precodetemplate mytemplate do      stuff      variablespassword databag[password] end codepre  pThis code is all fine and good, until later, the template fails.  When it does, it dumps everything, including the password, that was directed into the erb template.  This data is automatically logged in plain text which is automatically combed later by some other scripts, which, naturally, makes me uncomfortable.p  pBarring writing perfect code all the time, is there any way to prevent this behaviorp

Negative 35037 pI have the following problem I have large chunks of data and I want different threads to process a part of this data in parallel. First synchronization must take place here, such that all threads wait until the last thread has finished its process. Then, I want to trigger a writerreader mechanism Thread 0 makes a calculation using the data it has gathered from the data chunk and after it has done with the calculation, thread 1 starts to process its output. Thread 2 then uses thread 1s output and so on, in this particular order. After all threads finished this writerreader sequence, they begin to work on the next data chunk.p  pI may implement this using fancy locking mechanisms but I am very positive that there should be special Task Parallel Library methods which I can use for a more easy and efficient solution. Are there any such methods in TPL that I can use for this kind of problemp

Negative 35037 pWe have a BLE peripheral that subscribes to ANCS. It also hosts some custom services to which our app connects.p  pBecause of ANCS, connection to the peripheral xxx has to be made in the Settings app. So we do not have any facility from within the app to initiate a BLE connection. This also keeps the UseEx cleaner, and reduces corner cases.p  pThe idea being that the user connects in the Settings app. Then if the peripheral goes out of range, iOS will automatically reconnect once back in range.p  pHowever the client found that often the peripheral would not reconnect after say being out of the room.p  pWe can only reliably reproduce this by placing the BLE peripheral inside a metal box at approx 15 metres distance from the iPhone. By opening and closing the case at just the right speed, we can induce a series of failed ANCS connection requests within a 10 second or so timeframe.p  pHere are some device console logs showing the first failed connection due to signal loss.p  precodeMar 18 163805 afesiPhone BTLEServer[107] ltNoticegt Note  Central xxx is now subscribed to characteristic ANCS Data Source Mar 18 163807 afesiPhone BTServer[68] ltErrorgt Core       Connection timed out to device xxxxxxx Mar 18 163807 afesiPhone BTLEServer[107] ltNoticegt Note  Peripheral xxx is now disconnected Error DomainCBErrorDomain Code6 The connection has timed out unexpectedly.

The time has to be within the 11 or so seconds range. We cant slow down our interrogations or we go up against the 30 second key exchange with pairing time outs.p  pThis grey list means that iOS will no longer allow a reconnection of this peripheral to ANCS without the user opening Settings and manually connecting to it.p  pWhich means that the CBCentralManager  retrieveConnectedPeripheralsWithServices method will not retrieve the peripheral because it is no longer connected.p  pWe have had to add a workaround whereby we now store the UDID of any peripherals previously seen, then upon a callback to didDisconnectPeripheral we reconnect using  retrievePeripheralsWithIdentifiersp  pHowever, to maintain continuity of ANCS connection, we have also had to add bluetoothcentral UIBackground mode to Info.plist so that reconnection is made upon receipt of didDisconnectPeripheral with the app in the background. Of course if the app is unloaded then without state preservation and restoration, the ANCS connection will again be dropped.p  pFor good measure we are also utilising a watchdog timer to periodically check for connection state, when in foreground.p  pWe can only reproduce the effect with difficulty, our client seems to be able to see it very often, it is certainly true that connection unreliability is likely for BLE devices.p  pWe could make our app much more power efficient and develop it with much less effort if ANCS was handled more robustly in iOS.p  pDevices used are iPhone 4S and iPhone 6 both on iOS 8.1 and 8.2. p  pQuestion is  Has anyone else seen this behaviour with ANCS p

Negative 35037 pDesigning a database, theres a relationship between two tables, codeJobcode and codeDocumentcode. One codeJobcode can have multiple codeDocumentscode, but one and only one of these codeDocumentscode needs to be flagged as codeIsCurrentcode. This is not always the most recent codeDocumentcode associated with that codeJobcode.p  pStructurally, I can see two ways of doing this.p  pThe first is to add a codeDocumentIdcode column to codeJobcode, and a codeJobIdcode column to codeDocumentcode. This will work, but creates a circular reference when imported into Entity Framework you end up with the peculiar situation that a codeJobcode has both a codeDocumentcode and a codeDocumentscode collection. Likewise that codeDocumentcode has both a codeJobcode and a codeJobscode collection.p  pThe second is to add an codeIsCurrentcode bit flag to the codeDocumentcode table. This will work, but leaves it logically possible for a Job to have multiple codeIsCurrentcode codeDocumentscode, which is not allowed.p  pQuestionsp  p1 Am I right in thinking theres no third way out of this dilemmap  p2 Presuming not, which is better, and why I favour the second solution as it seems much cleaner and we can enforce the single codeIsCurrentcode through the business logic. My colleague favours the former solution because it results in simpler C code and object references  if we rename the foreign keys, it should avoid the confusion created by codeJobJobscode. p

I accidentally selected remove tab while the tab control was selected so it deleted all of the contents that were within the control, including my datagridview. I quickly did ctr  z to undo what I had deleted however, only the tab control and Panel reappeared. I cant see the gridview at all and I have tried to use send to back and bring to front for both the panel and the tab control thinking it was hiding behind it but I still dont see the DatagridView control. p  pWhat blows my mind even more is that I tried to just add another DataGridView and rename it to be the same name as the one that disappeared and it tells me The name DataGridView1 is already in use by another component. p  pIf I go to my Filename.Designer.vb, the old datagridview control is still there. p  pWhy cant I see the control on the screen anymore and why cant I rename a new datagridview to replace my old onep

Negative 35037 pIm setting up a game with Lidgren, and I was wondering if there was a way to read a message from a certain client instead of just from the server as a whole, such asp  precodeWhy doesnt this exist NetIncomingMessage message  server.Connections[0].ReadMessage codepre  pThis way I would be able to split up reading data from each client into its own thread and have a separate thread for sending data to each client.  Currently there is only one loop in my server, which reads packets and I fear is favoring one client more than others, as some movements made by players take a while to be received by other players.  I believe reading messages separately from each client would solve this issue.  With simple TcpClients, you can read from each clients stream instead of the server as a whole, and I like this functionality but also rely on the simplicity of sending packets through Lidgren and was wondering if there was a similar functionality with Lidgren.p

Negative 35037 pIve recently done some testing with Amazon AWS security groups in our VPC. p  pI have a LAMP stack server inside of sgoffice and have ports 22, 80 and 3306 open to our office IP32. Everything works great.p  pI thought that you could add SG B to SG A to organize IPs a bit. For example, I wanted to create a sgcontractors and an sgoffice to organize the remote IPs that would have access into a separate security group, since the remote contractors IPs are prone to change, while our office IP is static.p  pHere are the steps I followed.p  ol liI added a new sgcontractors security group and added their IP32 and ingress on 22, 80, and 3306,li liwent back to sgoffice and added ingress ALL TCP to custom IP sgcontractors. It popped up in the list of other security groups as I typed sg..., so I figured this had to be the way to do it.li ol  pThe remote users could not connect.p  pI tried again, p  ol start3 liediting sgcontractors to have ingress ALL TCP set to 0.0.0.00 li ol  pStill the remote users cannot connect. I even p  ol start4 liadded ingress ALL TCP contractorssg to contractorssg, as a test. li ol  pStill the remote users cannot connect to the server.p  pNaturally, if I put the remote contractors IP32 directly into sgoffice and readd ports 22, 80 and 3306 for their IP32, it works fine, it just makes the sgoffice rules much more disorganized and confusing, since theres no way to label any IPs and there has to be multiple rules per contractor.  p  pSo what am I missing and how do you make this workp

Negative 35037 pI searched in stackoverflow and google for a way to protect login authentication in PHP against SQL Injection. I have a table in MySQL that contains the username and password of users I manually add them instead of giving users freedom to signup. Before accessing the table, I want to make sure first that the username or password entered by the user does not contain SQL scripts. Can I simply check if the username or password only contained letters and numbers If so what script checks if the username contains only letters and numbers I know how to check if its all letters or all numbers but I want to check if they are a mix of letters or numbers. That being said, Im a bit worried that not including special characters in username or password makes the authentication even more vulnerable to attack.p  pIs it alright to force special characters out of username and password Is there a way to allow special characters but still protect the site from SQL Injections The description for codemysqlrealescapestringcode states it is already deprecated so I dont want to use that. Im very new to PHP so Im not good with prepared statements as well. Right now Im just thinking about removing quotes, openclose parentheses or spaces from username and password.p  pAlso note that the main login page codeindex.phpcode contains the form but I placed the login authentication on the target PHP page of that form codeauthenticate.phpcode so the validation happens there and the user wont be able to view the source of that page. p

Negative 35037 pAttending to its specification, JSON elements and javascript objects are unordered so, even in almost all cases, when you iterate over a javascript object, you get elements in the same order they was defined you definitively cannot trust in that order because engine is allowed to alter it.p  pThis is extremely rare. I have been able to observe it one time, but I dont find that code right now and I dont remember the exact version of JS engine but it was node. If I manage to find it, I will add it to this post.p  pThat being said, the point is that code relying in this behaviour can and should be considered buggy because, even it will work as expected in most engines, it may fail typically because of internal engine optimisations.p  pFor examplep  precodeuse strict var x       b 23,     a 7   function someSortinginput      var output       Object.keysinput.sort.map         functionk             output[k]  input[k]                   return output   x  someSortingx  Some smart engine could notice that input and output objects have the  exact same properties and guess that, attending the unordered nature of  javascript Object, there is no need to actually execute someSorting  console.logx  Usually will display  a 7, b 23   But perfectly we could got  b 23, a 7  codepre  pstrongI knowstrong there is too many literature even StackOverflow questions about this NON issue and workarrounds to achieve the expected behaviour by sorting keys in a separate array.p  pBut doing so code goes too messy compared in simply trusting in key order.p  pIm pretty sure that this can be achieved in a more elegant fashion by implementing a socalled sObject alternative having native Object as its prototype but overloading its native iterator and setter so thatp  ul liWhen any new property is added, its key is appended to an Array index mantained under the hood.li liWhen an sObject eminstanceem is iterated, our customized iterator uses that index to retrieve elements in the right order.li ul  pstrongIn summarystrong Actual Object specification is right because, in most cases, properties order doesnt care. So I think that engine optimisations that could mess it are wonderfull.p  pBut it would be also wonderful to have an alternative emsObjectem with which we could do something likep  precodevar x  new sObjectb 23, a 7 codepre  p...and trust that we could iterate it strongin the same exactstrong order or, also  at least, do some sorting task over it and trust that this will not be altered.p  pstrongOf coursestrong Im initalyzing it with a native javascript Object so, in fact, theoretically we cant trust that it will be populated right even I cant imagine why any engine emoptimisationem should alter it before any operation.p  pI used that notation for brevity and, I confess because I expect that, in that case emshouldem work always even Im not really sure. However we even could sort it later which, in most cases we will do that way or use other kind of initialization like providing a JSON string or an array of objects or arrays with single key and value pairs.p  pMy concern is Such a thing exists yet I wasnt able to find it. But sure Im not the first guy thinking in that...p  pI can try to implement it Im thinking about that. I think its possible and that I could achieve it. But its not as simple so first I want to be sure that Im not reinventing the wheel...p  pSo any comments, suggestions, etc... will be welcome.p
