Positive 8073 pI can successfully list users from WSO2 IS using listUsers of RemoteUserStoreManager soap service call. There is only two options that we can pass. One is filter and other is max limit. However there is no paginated service call for the same. Is there any way possible to achieve the same For example I want to query users from only 1020. p
Positive 8073 pIs it possible to generate JWTs without enabling caching on the Key Manager  If its not, is it safe to have both Gateway and KeyManager caching turned onp  pWe are running API Manager with IS serving as the Key Manager.  It appears that if I disable Key Manager Caching EnableKeyMgtValidationInfoCachefalse JWT tokens are no longer sent to the back end, even though EnableTokenGenerationtrue.  p  pWith them both on I get JWTs as expected.  If I set EnableKeyMgtValidationInfoCachefalse and change nothing else, the JWTs are absent.p  pWe have Gateway Caching enabled and wish to keep it enabled for performance reasons, but a hrefhttpsdocs.wso2.comdisplayAM191ConfiguringCachingConfiguringCachingKeycache relnofollowthe documentationa says that having them both on is not recommended.p  pFor reference here are the configuration settings Ive tried and my resultsp  pre EnableGateway   EnableKeyMgt   Enable    Result   KeyCache     ValidationInfo  JWTCache                     Cache                        true          false         false   No JWT      true          false         true    No JWT      false         false         false   No JWT      false         false         true    No JWT      true          true          false   Works.  This seems suboptimal because the JWTs arent being generated per request and were double caching.      true          true          true    Works.  Enable a separate JWT cache so that it changes more frequently, but those changes wont be seen until GW cache expires.      false         true          false   Never tried this combo.      false         true          true    Works.  This should produce a different JWT per request, but doesnt have GW caching.   pre  ul liAPIM 1.9.1li liIS 5.0.0 with SP1li ul
Positive 8073 pWe are looking at the WSO2 Governance Registry tool to help us in enforcing governance  specifically v5.0 and the dependency graphing is awesome.

I would like to extend the list of server types to reflect what is being used here.p  pI managed to find the location of the server configuration using the Carbon browser and have added the types.  p  pHowever, the Publisher still shows the original list.  But when I view a specific servers details in the Carbon browser, I can see the values Ive added and I can edit a servers details to reflect the applicable type.  p  pHowever, the moment I view the server details in the Publisher it shows the updated value, but on editing the field, only the original drop down list without my changes are shown.p  pIs the publishers list of server types stored in a different location  I edited the list found here p  blockquote   psystemconfigrepositorycomponentsorggovernanceconfigurationserverp blockquote
Positive 8073 pIm having trouble importing the right stuff in Eclipse so that I can patch some classes for WSO2 Identity Server 5.0.0.

Positive 8073 pWe are investigating the upgrade path for ESB 4.9.0.

Positive 8073 pWe are using WSO2 Is 5.0 SP1. We have configured ReadOnly LDAP and also using entitlement feature of the identity server.

Positive 8073 pI am creating a hosted system where multiple customers can send messages. I am receiving thoses messages on a JMS queue.p  pNow, all processing is done in a similar way and I want my process to poll all incoming queues for messages and handle them. Is there a way in WSO2 ESB to subscribe to multiple queuesp  pIf not possible, the workaround would be to create a seperate listener process for each queue and have this post the message to a central processing queue. But that seems to be a less clean solution and I think it will scale worse than listening to multiple queues.p  pAny ideas on thisp
Positive 8073 pOk, this is a continuation to my original question. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32721334wso2esbfilteringmessagestoanoutputfileWSo2 Esb filtering messages to an output filea After a couple more days of research into the iterate and aggregate mediator I have reached a progress wall and would be very grateful for any advice how to resolve my blocking issue. The task at hand is simple, read and xml file, filter on certain records, and only produce an output xml file with just those records that meet the criteria. After previous discussion and research this tasks solution is as follows use a iterate mediator to access each xml record and use a filter mediator to decide what I want to keep. Then use a aggregator mediator to write all these records to 1 file. Without the aggregator my configuration is producing 1 record per file.

Positive 8073 pI would like to improve my product and I would like to write a complex analyzer interface for it . I am using elasticsearch for storing logs, and more than 50 million logs are stored on daily basis . So the important thing would be that different queries could be created on the above mentioned interface which would significantly limit the number of logs to be analyzed. The wso2 cep component would get the logs to be tested then it would return back the result as json which would be displayed on my application. WSO2 cep library would be great if I could use the timestamp of logs instead of internal time  System.currentTimeMillis  .p  pa hrefhttpsdocs.wso2.comdisplayCEP300Windows relnofollowhttpsdocs.wso2.comdisplayCEP300Windowsap  pIt would be nice if there were a way to use attribute as timestamp or use the timestamp parameter of send method .p  precodepublic void sendlong timeStamp, Object[] data throws InterruptedException codepre  pIn the meantime I found another problem  I need those events which followed by a specified events.p  pExample  p  precode        query   from every a1LoginEvents[ip  192.10.1.2]lt2gt gt                           b1LoginEvents[ip  192.10.1.1]lt1gt                within 10 sec                select a1[0].myTime, a1[0].ip, b1[0].ip as b1ip, b1[0].myTime as b2Time                insert into OutPut for allevents       siddhiManager.addCallbackqueryReference, new QueryCallback          Override         public void receivelong timeStamp, Event[] inEvents, Event[] removeEvents              if inEvents  null                  for Event e  inEvents                      System.out.printf Ip1  s Time1  s Ip2 s Time2  s n, e.getData1, new DateLong e.getData0.toString, e.getData2, new DateLong e.getData3.toString                                                   InputHandler inputHandler  siddhiManager.getInputHandlerLoginEvents     Calendar c  Calendar.getInstance     c.addCalendar.HOUR, 1     c.addCalendar.SECOND, 1     int i  0     String ip  null     for i  0 i lt 50 i          ip  192.10.1.2         c.addCalendar.SECOND, 2         if i  10  0              ip  192.10.1.1                  System.out.printfSending event  time s , ip  s n, c.getTime.toString, ip         inputHandler.sendc.getTime.getTime, new Object[]c.getTime.getTime, ip, 1, new Random.nextInt1000      codepre  pThere are no results for the above query.

Negative 8073 pI have a web application asp.net where work items are submitted and allocated to users according to their workload.p  pA users workload is calculated using an algorithm based on the number of items currently allocated to the user and some other factors.

Negative 8073 pI have a system which Ive been wrestling with for a while. Essentially, it uses a lot of abstraction to deal with the fact that later extension is not just expected, but necessary. One place this is required is data access. The system generally deals with managing objects encapsulating some observation in the sense of an observed value or set of values and using them. To this end, I have something to the effect ofp  precodepublic interface Observation        UniqueKey is used to accessidentify an observation      UniqueKey Key              get        public interface ObservationDataSource               Retrieves an Observation from the actual data source.        performs any necessary operations to encapsulate values in object            Observation GetObservationByUniqueKeyUniqueKey key  codepre  pThe problem arises for specific implementations of these interfaces. Eventually, the codeObservationcode and codeObservationDataSourcecode class are implemented with specific runtime classes. However, codeUniqueKeycode may also be extended to deal with whatever the uniquely identifying set of values are for an observation in the data source maybe an id, maybe a time, etc. So any implementation of codeGetObservationByUniqueKeycode will expose a codeUniqueKeycode argument, but expect a specific subclass. I expect the codeUniqueKeycode to be casted to a specific type once passed in. p  pThis seems like a poor design choice, since the implementation is lying about the argument requirements  but I cant see another way of doing this. I expect other people to be using these interfaces, so I cant just say that Ill remember this convention.p  pAny ideas to fix it or handle it more elegantlyp

Negative 8073 p I currently debug a multi threaded application, which runs without errors until some functions where called about 2000 times. After that the application stops responding, which I could track down to beginthreadex failing with an out of memory error. p  p When examining the Application in ProcessExplorer I can see a growing number of thread handles leaked and a growing virtual memory until the error occurs, the private bytes stay low. The leaked threads also call CoInitialize and never call CoUninitialize. p  pWhat I would like to know isbrp  ul liWhat does the Virtual memory represent li liIs the virtual memory related to the leaked thread handlesli liDoes COM or MSXML6 called by the threads copy thread handles and how can I Close themli ul  p I hope that my question is clear and doesnt break any roules,it is my first question and english isnt my first language. p  p I forgot to mention, I close the handles returned by beginthreadex once the threads get terminated, which reduces the number of open handles by about half but does not affect the virtual memory. Additionally before i inserted the CloseHandle call each thread handle shown in ProcessExplorer had a handle count of two for the thread. p  pstrongEditstrongp  p I fell stupid for not including this before, I know that the threads exit as the number of active threads while debugging with visual studio does not grow. And I do hope that not all of the leaked memory is a result of calls to TerminateThread as they are used in a rather big library and I would prefer not modifying that. p  p To the com part of my question, with htrace diff i find thread handles allocated by msxml but not freed after the functioncalls end, could they be related to the leak or will they be Closed at a later time p  pp Thanks for all those comments, while the problem is still there they helped me understand it better.p

As of now we have SQL replication taking care of that but file replication seems to be a little tougher.

Negative 8073 pThis is not a homework.p  pIm using a small priority queue implemented as array at the moment for storing last N items with emsmallestem value. This is a bit slow  ON item insertion time. Current implementation keeps track of largest item in array and discards any items that wouldnt fit into array, but I still would like to reduce number of operations further.p  plooking for a priority queue algorithm that matches following requirementsp  ol liqueue can be implemented as array, which has fixed size and cannot grow. Dynamic memory allocation during any queue operation is strictly forbidden.  li Anything that doesnt fit into array is discarded, but queue keeps all smallest elements ever encountered. li OlogN insertion time i.e. adding element into queue should take up to OlogN. li optional O1 access for largest item in queue queue stores smallest items, so the largest item will be discarded first and Ill need them to reduce number of operations li Easy to implementunderstand. Ideally  something similar to binary search  once you understand it, you remember it forever. li Elements need not to be sorted in any way. I just need to keep N smallest value ever encountered. When Ill need them, Ill access all of them at once. So technically it doesnt have to be a queue, I just need N last smallest values to be stored. ol  pI initially thought about using binary heaps they can be easily implemented via arrays, but apparently they dont behave well when array cant grow anymore. Linked lists and arrays will require extra time for moving things around. stl priority queue grows and uses dynamic allocation I emmayem be wrong about it, though.p  pSo, any other ideasp  pEDITbr Im not interested in STL implementation. STL implementation suggested by a few people works a bit slower than currently used linear array due to high number of function calls.p  pIm interested in priority queue emalgorithmsem, not implemnetations.p

But it   will only do a few dozen transactions   per second. Transaction speed is   limited by the rotational speed of   your disk drive. A transaction   normally requires two complete   rotations of the disk platter, which   on a 7200RPM disk drive limits you to   about 60 transactions per second.   Transaction speed is limited by disk   drive speed because by default   SQLite actually waits until the data   really is safely stored on the disk   surface before the transaction is   complete. That way, if you suddenly   lose power or if your OS crashes, your   data is still safe. For details, read   about atomic commit in SQLite..p      pBy default, each INSERT statement is   its own transaction. But if you   surround multiple INSERT statements   with BEGIN...COMMIT then all the   inserts are grouped into a single   transaction. The time needed to commit   the transaction is amortized over all   the enclosed insert statements and so   the time per insert statement is   greatly reduced.p      pAnother option is to run PRAGMA   synchronousOFF. This command will   cause SQLite to not wait on data to   reach the disk surface, which will   make write operations appear to be   much faster. But if you lose power in   the middle of a transaction, your   database file might go corrupt.p blockquote  padding a transaction codeBEGINcode, codeCOMMITcode boosted the performance for 300 insert from 45 sec to 1 sec.

Negative 8073 pI use rsync to mirror a remote server. It is said that using a root password with rsync is dangerous, so I created a special rsync user. It seems to work fine, but cannot copy some files because of file permissions. I want to mirror whole directories for backup, and I guess this cannot be done without using root password, I mean if root does not give permissions on a specific files, no other account can read them. Is there other solutions and why shouldnt I use root account in rsync I only do one way copying, that does not effect source.p

Negative 8073 pIm working on a game on iPhone, which uses C and OpenGL ES 1.x library. It works fine on simulator. But when I install it on real iPhone, I found out that on iPhone original, it took about 20 milliseconds to render a frame. However, it took 3540 milliseconds to render a frame on iPhone 3GS.p  pIve tried various OS, including 3GS  iOS 3.1.2, 3G  iOS 4.0, 3GS  iOS 4.1, iPad  iOS 3.2. All of them render much slower than iPhone original, which sounds really ridiculous to me. I tried google for anything I can think of, fixing every problem it might be related to, but nothing changed.p  pI have 2 machine which these pieces of code render faster 1 iPhone original with iOS 3.1.3,  2 iPod Touch with iOS 3.1.3.

And 4 machine which render mysteriously slower 1 iPhone 3G with iOS 4.0, 2 iPhone 3GS with iOS 3.1.2, 3 iPhone 3GS with iOS 4.1, 4 iPad with iOS 3.2. iPhone took about 3540 milliseconds to render a frame and iPad took around 25.p  pI use PVRTC for texture, which is first cooked and make into a bundle.

Negative 8073 pWe are using TIBCO JMS 4.3.3 with the same version of .Net TIBCO.EMS.dll for .net 2.0 We are having huge problems with stuck messages in queues. We are consuming messages from one queue which is bridged from the topic. Our application creates multiple consumers with long lived sessions  each long lived sessions has one consumer. The sessions and consumers are created in the main thread, but consumers themselves are consuming messages using Receive method with timeout on separate threads. Each consumer has own thread in which its working. On each successful receive we are calling Commit on a session which created consumer who received the message sorry for ugly wording.p  pThe problem is that when this queues is heavily filled by the bridge from topic many of messages are getting stuck  none of threads can receive them and we can clearly see them browsing the queue and they get reprocessed if we restart our application. Also we see that when messages are getting stuck number of sent messages are becoming non equal to number of acknowledged messages if running show consumer in TIBCO console.p  pWe are absolutely lost  we tried enabling and disabling prefetch for this queue. Neither solution worked. We increased receive timeout from 1 second to 1 minute and still messages are getting stuck when number of pending messages are crossing some boundary.p  pAny help, tip or suggestion will be highly appreciated.p

Negative 8073 pIm very very new to Fortran and the whole Intel compiler thing Im using the Windowsbased Intel compiler with IMSL library wo Visual Studio integration, therefore command line only. p  pThe problem should be extremely simple I have a Fortran program that I needed to compile thats stored as four different source code parts. The main program and some subroutines are stored in the code file named central.for, and there are also three files, lets call them s1.for, s2.for and s3.for, each of which contains only one subroutine lets call them sub1sub3 and no main program. The main program calls the subroutines stored in s1s3 as well as in central.for. p  pThe question is how should I compile it p  pWhen I try to compile the central.for, it gives codeerror LNK2019 unresolved external symbol SUB1 referenced in function MAINcode. Similarly it gives the same message for SUB2 and SUB3. p  pWhen I try to compile s1.fors3.for, it gives codeerror LNK2019 unresolved external symbol MAIN referenced in function maincodep  pIt seems obvious that I need to link them somehow.

Negative 8073 pWe have a problem with HTTP Response caching when using WCF RIA Services with Silverlight.p  pServer side, we have a simple DomainService GET method with no caching specified, like thisp  precode  [OutputCacheOutputCacheLocation.None]   public IQueryableltSearchResultsgt GetSearchResultsstring searchText codepre  pThe throws a DomainException when the user is not authenticated i.e. when the FormsAuthenticationCookie expires. This is as designed. p  pBut when the user is reauthenticated, and the Query is called again with the same searchText parameter, then the Query never gets to the server no breakpoint hit Fiddler shows no http request sent. p  pI think this is because when the exception is thrown on the server, the HTTP Response has the strongCacheControlstrong property set to strongprivatestrong, and when the client wants to perform the same query later once the user is logged in, then the browser does not even send the request to the server.p  pIf we enter a different search parameter, then the query is reexecuted no problem.p  pstrongIs there any way of ensuring the http response always has nocaching  even when it does not return normallystrongp  pstrongUPDATE1strong The problem only occurs when deployed to IIS  when testing from Visual Studio with either  Casini or IIS Express it works fine.p  pstrongUPDATE2strong I updated the question to reflect new knowledge.p

Negative 8073 pthank you for taking the time to read this.p  pThe situation is basically, Im using EnumProcessModulesEx to enumerate all the modules in a loaded process. Ive verified that the process Im getting with GetCurrentProcess is correct via the ID. I seem to be getting all the loaded modules except the one I want Its a C DLL that is only loaded when the C DLL function is called. I made sure the DLL was loaded before I ran the enumerating function. Is there a reason this C DLL wont show upp  pI also put this enumeration after I load a couple of other C DLLs in my C code. It doesnt seem to be finding those either. All of these C DLLs are dynamically loaded. I figure it shouldnt matter because a everything is mapped into the process address space anyways, and b I have a C DLL that is injected dynamically loaded and I can find that just fine. My goal is to be able to hook a C DLL function, so being able to find these C DLLs is a must in this project. p  pThank you all again for any tips or insights p

Is C0x constexpr neccessary here and if so, how exactly should I use it should codeint ncode be const or constexpr.p  pI know that constexpr would work with constant parameters, but would it partially be optimized if part of the parameters were constant and part were variablep  pstrongSummarystrong Is it possible for a function it has to be inline right to be partially optimized with constant propagation, and, if so, what are the requirements to do itp  pEven as I am writing this I am thinking that an inline function call would propagate constants...p

There are at least not that I could find few post about how to use the emrichpopupPanelem and how to submit values from it.p  pTo make matter worse the panel seams to add when checking the html a hard coded content to its component id name to the div generated. I have tried to use emaj4regionem tag to partial render the complete form. But that didnt seamed to work, cause nothing where posted to managed bean. So now I have one option left, where the panel has its own form, outside the main one on the page. p  pI can see that the evaluation of the form popup values is happening, but not the execution of the bean function that persist the values I see the POST request of the command button. The only reason I can think of at the moment, is that the popup panel use another bean to persist the values that the main form on the page both of them are session scoped.

Negative 8073 pAn issue that has come to light is to open up our application we can visualise it a bit like an online shop to unregistered users.p  pAt the moment, there is an admin system where staff are added by superusers and a website with customers who add themselves by registering.p  pWe have been asked to allow customers to use the website without registering or logging in, but we dont want to break the orders table  we still need to refer to each customer individually and maintain the registered users functionality address lookup, purchase history, etc. The main idea weve been mulling over is to use the unregistered customers email address as a replacement for the surrogate key or a hash of it in the customer table so that new and old customers can just enter their email address at checkout to be added to our database and receive confirmation of their order. The problem of different email addresses per customer can be alleviated by a merge tool on the admin side, and the problem of multiple customers sharing the same email some office environments isnt that much of a problem for us.p  pThe main question is this how do realworld applications handle unregistered usersp  pstrongUpdate in response to answersstrongp  pWe dont want to force registered users to login each time even if their email address is already on our system as a registered user. Also, if people are advocating using the email address as a key, how would you deal with a scenario where a registered account holder gives up their email address to someone elsep
Negative 8073 pIm trying to register a performance counter and part of this process includes adding some textual descriptions to a specific registry key.  For English this key is HKEYLOCALMACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionPerflib009 which apparently is also known as HKEYPERFORMANCETEXT.  There are a pair of values under there Counter, Help that have REGMULTISZ data, and I need to modify them to accomplish my goal.p  pThe official way of doing this is by using a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa37187828vVS.8529.aspx relnofollowtool called lodctr along with a .h and .ini filea.  There is also a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa37218728vVS.8529.aspx relnofollowfunction for doing this programmaticallya, but my understanding is that it is just a simple wrapper around calling the lodctr program.  I found the prospect of maintaining, distributing, and keeping synchronized 3 separate files a bit cumbersome, so I previously wrote code to do this and it worked fine under Windows XP and possibly Vista, though I dont remember for sure.p  pNow Im trying to use the same code on Windows 7 and it doesnt work.  The problem is that whenever I try to set the registry values it fails with ERRORBADKEY even regedit fails to modify the values, so its not a problem with my code.  I ran Process Monitor against it and noticed that there was no activity at the driver level, so it seems this access must be getting blocked in usermode code e.g. advapi32.dll or wherever.  I understand why Microsoft would try to prevent people from doing this as it is very easy to screw up, and doing so will screw up the entire performance counter collection on the machine.p  pIm going to debug lodctr and see what the magic is purely out of curiosity, but Im wondering if anybody has run into this before  Are there any alternatives other than the lodctr utility  Perhaps calling the NT registry API directly  I would really prefer to avoid the hassle of the lodctr method if possible.p  pA minimal example to reproduce the issuep  precodeHKEY hKey  NULL LONG nResult  RegOpenKeyExHKEYLOCALMACHINE, TSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionPerflib009, 0, KEYALLACCESS, amphKey ifERRORSUCCESS  nResult      LPCTSTR lpData  Tbar     DWORD cbData  tcsclenlpData  1  sizeofTCHAR     nResult  RegSetValueExhKey, Tfoo, 0, REGSZ, const BYTElpData, cbData      here nResult  ERRORBADKEY     RegCloseKeyhKey     hKey  NULL  codepre  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pI spent about an hour or so trying to debug the official APIs and couldnt figure it out so I tried some more Google.  After a while I came across a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb933241 relnofollowthis KB articlea which explains the RegSetValueEx behavior.  Since it mentioned modifying system files that got me to thinking that perhaps this particular registry data is backed by a mapped file.  Then I came across a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb300956 relnofollowanother KB articlea that mentions Perfc009.dat and Perfh009.dat in the system32 folder.  Opened these up in a hex editor and sure enough it is the raw REGMULTISZ data I am trying to modify.  Now that I know that maybe I can take another look and figure it out, though I am bored with it for now.p

If i only comment out the scale command and change the amount translated by to a smaller number, it also draws successfully upsidedown and translated a small amount.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 8073 pAre there any installer makers that would allow me to create an installer that can add a Scheduled task to the Windows Task Schedulerp  pOur product is a web application that uses IISApplication pools and MSSQL. We are currently using InstallShield and a some batch and powershell scripts to do what we want but we have found that InstallShield is hard to use. Our InstallShield Installer installs the product and the batch files to the install directory and calls them at the end of the installer.p  pIdeally we would like to be able to Create the IIS applicationswith custom settings, Create a windows network share, Setup the MSSQL database, and add the tasks to the task scheduler using the installer. If this isnt possible we would at least like an install tool that would allow us to pass variables from input fields to external scripts and programs easier than install shield.p  pDo you have any information on install tools that would be able to do any of thisp

Negative 8073 pI have a buggy kernel module which I am trying to fix. Basically when this module is running, it will cause other tasks to hang for more than 120 seconds. Since almost all the hung tasks are waiting for either mmmmapsem or some file system locks inodeimutex I suspect that it has something to do with this module doesnt not grab the mmapsem lock and some filesystem level lock like inoteimutex in order, which could have caused some deadlock problem. Since my module does not try to grab those locks directly though, I assume it is some function I called that grab those locks. And now I am trying to figure out which function calls in my module is causing the problem.p  pHowever, I am having a hard time debugging it for the following reasonsp  ol lipI dont know exactly which lock the hung task is trying to grab. I got the call trace of the hung task, and know at what point it hangs. Kernel also gives me some kind of information like 1 lock held by automount3115 0  amptypeimutexdirkey2.., at [] reallookup0x240xc5.  However, I want to know exact which lock a task holds, and exactly which lock it is trying to acquire in order to figure out the problem. As kernel doesnt provide the arguments of function calls along with the call trace, I find this information difficult to obtain. pli lipI am using gdb andvmware to debug this, which allows me to set breakpoints, step into a function and such. However, as which task and at what point that task will hang is kind of undeterministic, I dont really know where to set breakpoints and inspect. It will be great if I can somehow attach to the task which kernel reported to be blocked for more than 120 secs, and get some information about it. pli ol  pSo my questions are as followingp  ol lipWhere can I get, along with the call trace, the arguments of the functions in the call trace, in order to figure out exactly which lock a task is trying to grab.pli lipIs it possible for me to use gdb to somehow attach to a hung task in a kernel If not, is there some way for me to at least examine the data structure which represents that task As I am having a hard time examining all the global data structure in kernel too. GDB always complains that cant access memory 0x3200 or something similar. pli lipIt would also be very helpful if I can print out for every task in the kernel, what locks they are currently holding. Is there a way to do itpli ol  pThank you very muchp

Once the user has granted your application   permission to use their account, the browserbased part of this   process is over and you can return them to your application.p      pJust like the request for a new token, the approved response will   include a AuthenticationCallback header which again, is a convenient   way to redirect your application back to the API and generate the real   session id.p blockquote  pNow my question is if I have the username and password, can I authenticate that user by HttpURLConnection or any other wayp  pI tried thisp  precodeurl  new URLcallBackUrl connection  HttpURLConnection url.openConnection connection.setRequestMethodPOST         BASE64Encoder encoder  new BASE64Encoder String usernamepassword  myusername    mypassword String encodedAuthorization  encoder.encodeusernamepassword.getBytes connection.setRequestPropertyAuthorization, Basic  encodedAuthorization headerFields  connection.getHeaderFields  forMap.EntryltString, ListltStringgtgt entry  headerFields.entrySet      System.out.printlnentry.getKey     entry.getValue  codepre  pBut in console I gotp  precodenull  [HTTP1.1 404 Not Found] Status  [404 Not Found] XFrameOptions  [sameorigin] Date  [Tue, 28 Feb 2012 083017 GMT] Vary  [AcceptEncoding] XCascade  [pass] ContentLength  [7835] XXSSProtection  [1 modeblock] SetCookie  [tmdb.sessionBAh7CUkiD3Nlc3Npb25faWQGOgZFRiJFNGRkMjc5ODYwMjJmYWYwZDlmOGE50AOTVjY2E0NWFjMzhhYTRiOGFjOGJiYjQ5ZGFhNzExNDdkMGM4MWNhZGUyMEki0ADWxhbmd1YWdlBjsARkkiB2VuBjsARkkiC2xvY2FsZQY7AEZJIgd1cwY7AEZJ0AIg5sb2dnZWRfaW4GOwBGRg3D3D0A path expiresThu, 29Mar2012 083017 GMT HttpOnly] ContentType  [texthtmlcharsetutf8] Connection  [keepalive] Server  [nginx] codepre  pAs you can seep  precodeStatus  [404 Not Found] codepre  pSo the last procedure is not fruitful. p  pAm I implementing the authentication in a wrong wayp  pI really appreciate your suggestion.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 8073 pRecently I am developing a context menu in WPF with the following requirement,p  pstrongIf all the menu items in the context menu have Visibility Hidden, set the context menu visibility to Hidden.strongp  pI have a solution myself for this in a DataTemplate, which is to set ContextMenu Hidden as default, and use a Trigger for each menu item to check their visibility, if any of them is visible, trigger the ContextMenu visibility into visible.p  pSo the code is likep  precodeltDataTemplategt     ltContextMenu VisibilityHidden xNamecontextMenugt         ltMenuItem xNamemenuItem1 VisibilityBinding somebinding gt         ltMenuItem xNamemenuItem2 VisibliityBinding somebinding gt     ltContextMenugt     ltDataTemplate.Triggergt         ltTrigger SourceNamemenuItem1 PropertVisibility ValueVisiblegt             ltSetter TargetNamecontextMenu PropertyVisibility ValueVisible gt         ltTriggergt         ltTrigger SourceNamemenuItem2 PropertVisibility ValueVisiblegt             ltSetter TargetNamecontextMenu PropertyVisibility ValueVisible gt         ltTriggergt     ltDataTemplate.Triggergt ltDataTemplategt codepre  pmy problem is that this really depends on the control which owns this context menu in this case it is the DataTemplate.

Negative 8073 pThis is a question about normalization of data that takes into account different parameters.p  pI have a set of articles in a website. The users use the rating system and rate the articles from 1 to 5 stars. 1 star means a bad article and marks the article bad. 2 stars give an average rating. 3,4 and 5 stars rate good, very good and excellent. p  pI want to normalize these ratings in the range of [0  2]. The normalized value will represent a score and will be used as a factor for boosting the article up or down in article listing. Articles with 2 or less stars, should get a score in the range of [01] so this boost factor will have a negative effect. Articles with rating of 2 or more stars should get a score in the range of [12] so this the boost factor will have a positive boost. p  pSo for example, an article that has a 3.6 stars will get a boost factor of 1.4. This will boost the article up in the articles listing. An article with 1.9 stars will get a score of 0.8. This score will boost the article further down in the listing. An article with 2 stars will get a boost factor of 1  no boost.p  pFurthermore I want to take into account the number of votes each article has. An article with a single vote of 3 stars must rank worse than an article of 4 votes and 2.8 stars average. the boost factor could be  1.2 and 1.3 respectivelyp

Negative 8073 pIm wanting to gauge peoples opinions on the use of static classes instead of namespaces. I come from a C background and am quite fond of its syntax and how it lets you structure code.

So, I did a bit of googling and was relieved to find that PHP has namespaces. My relief didnt last long though, I really dont like the syntax it adds more mess to my function calls.

Negative 8073 pGiven two abitrary HTML elements A and B in the same document, how can I find out which one is closer to the user i.e. if they overlap, which one is obscuring the otherp  pThe a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRCSS2visuren.htmllayers relnofollowW3C CSS Specificationa describes stacking contexts, which compliant rendering engines should implement. However, I couldnt find a way to access this information in a JavaScript program, crossbrowsers or not. All I can read is the css codezindexcode property, that per se doesnt say much, since most of the time is set to codeautocode or, even when expressed as a numeric value, is not a reliable indicator of how its actually displayed if they belong to different statcking contexts, comparing zindexes is irrelevant.p  pPlease note that Im interested in strongarbitrarystrong elements if both elements are below the mouse pointer, only one will be considered hovered, so I can easily find the closest one in this case. However, Im looking for a more general solution, preferably one that does not involve reimplementing the stacking algorithm that the rendering engine is already performing.p  pstrongUpdatestrong let me clarify a bit the reason behind this question I recently tackled a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq12095196520779a questiona that exposed a limitation in jQuerys drag and drop mechanism  it doesnt take zindexes into account when dropping, so if an element is obscuring another, it can still perform the drop operation in the element that is behind. While the linked question was answered for the OP particular case, the general problem persists, and theres no easy solution that I know of.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma12190361520779alexs answera below is useful, but not enough for the case at hand when dragging, the dragged element itself or more precisely its helper is the topmost element under the mouse cursor, so codeelementFromPointcode will return strongitstrong instead of the strongnextstrong topmost element, that we really need emworkaroundem a hrefhttpjqueryui.comdraggablecursorstyle relnofollowstyle the cursora so its placed outside the helper. The other intersection strategies that jQuery employ also take into account more than just one point, complicating the task of determining the topmost element that intersects the helper somehow. Being able to compare or sort elements by actual zindex would make a zindex aware intersection mode viable for the general case.p

So i tried from CLI too. Fulled query with dubious valuesp  precodeSELECT id FROM table WHERE title  Some title AND price  1.66 codepre  pAnd got desired records back. After that i strongquotedstrong price value toop  precodeSELECT id FROM table WHERE title  Some title AND price  1.66 codepre  pAnd got strongzerostrong records as result. p  pAfter that I tried with other quoted price values, like 1.67 and they worked fine.p  pWhat is problem here Why such simple queries fail To reproduce behaviour i put simple schema and query up to a hrefhttpsqlfiddle.com8b784770 relnofollowsqlfiddlea, As you may see simple query codeSELECT  FROM Table1 WHERE price  1.66 OR price  1.67code gives only one result. p  pI feel, it may be related to the nature of double datatype 1.66 is represented as 1.66666666... , but how should i form then my queries, when i use placeholders in DBIp

Negative 8073 pLets consider the following quote from the C11 standard a hrefhttpwww.openstd.orgjtc1sc22wg21docspapers2012n3376.pdf relnofollowthe N3376 drafta, to be precisep  blockquote   p2.14.8.5 p      pIf L is a userdenedstringliteral, let str be the literal without   its udsux and let len be the number of code units in str i.e., its   length excluding the terminating null character. The literal L is   treated as a call of the form p  precode     operator  X str , len  codepre blockquote  pWhereas for all the other types of userdefined literals floatingpoint, integer, character the length is never passed along even if the literal itself is passed as a string. For examplep  precode42zzz  calls operator  zzz42 and not operator  zzz42, 2 codepre  pWhy is there this distinction between string and nonstring userdefined literals Or should I say, why does the implementation pass len for UD string literals The length, just as in case of other literals, could be deduced by nulltermination. What am I missingp
Negative 8073 pIve done a fair bit of PHP over the years but Im currently learning ColdFusion and have come across the codeApplication.cfccode file.p  pBasically this is a class thats created once has an expire date. The class handles incoming users and can set session variables and static memory objects, such as queries. For example I can load site wide statistical data for one user in another thread from the codeApplication.cfccode. Something that would usually take a few seconds for each page would make the whole site quick and responsive. p  pAnother example just for clarification. If I put an incremental variable thats set to 0 in codeOnApplicationStartcode this variable can be incremented with each user request multiple users or in codeOnSessionStartcode without the need to contact the SQL database since its constantly in the servers memory under this application.p  pI was wondering if PHP has a similar file or object Something that can be created once and used to store temporary variablesp

Negative 8073 pLooking for some advice with an iOS application.p  pEssentially what my app does is generate a CSV file that logs certain events within a period of time. So users can press a button and an entry will be added to the log saying Event of type X happened at Time Tp  pThe way Im doing this is by maintaining an NSMutableArray which stores NSStrings. Each event adds a string to the NSMutableArray. p  pWhen the user is done with a session, they can export the file. Im using the NSMutableArrays writeToFile then I use an email interface to send that file as a CSV to a target email. p  pIt all works, except the CSV file that is generated has some metadata in it. Specifically, I believe at the top of the file I see  and  at the beginning of each row of cells when opened in excel. p  pIs this something inherent in the data structure NSMutableArray or data type NSString that I am using Is there a way for me to just get the raw data p  pI can upload code if need be Im not near the work computer now though, so Im testing the waters to see if there is something simple I can do to stop seeing this metadata.p  pThank youp

So, can this be shortened somehowp  pstrongEDIT 3strongp  pI found another way to provide a check for someone implementing the interface by defining it like thisp  precodeinterface FooltFooType extends FooltFooTypegtgt        Other interface definitions             Please implement with just this line in itltbrgtltbrgt       ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspltcodegtreturn thisltcodegt       return ltcodegtthisltcodegt           public FooType returnThis  codepre  pNow, if someone tries to implement the WrongFoo class as described above, he will have to provide the method codeFalseFoo returnThiscode and if he simply implements it as codereturn thiscode as requested in the doctype, that line will throw an error.p  pIts not a guarantee, but its a pretty good dummycheck against mistakes that come from careless copying of a class... And in a case where a message with this signature is required anyways, it would be a great solution.p  pAny more ideasp

Negative 8073 pIve been putting all of my images for my Java application in a package called rtype inside src where I also also have my Class that deals with these images. I wanted to sort the images and put them in a folder of their own. When I do this, The images will no longer load into the class, and I know its because I changed the file path.

Negative 8073 pI have a MVC 3.0 application which 3 controllers and action methods in it. The application is login based. And once the user is authenticated he is landed on the homepage where he sees the 3 menu links which are mapped to the action methods of the three controller. The user can click the links or enter the url in the address bar and can navigate to the respective page.p  pBut now the links have become role based like,p  pIf IsProductPageAllowedtrue then only user can see the ProductPage.p  pIf IsMediaPageAllowedtrue then only user can see the MediaPage.p  pI have handle the visiblity of the links easily in the HomePage view depending on the property valuetruefalse.p  pBut was looking for a correct way to block the user of accessing the ProductPage if he enters the url in address bar directly and if the value is false. I can do this easily on each action method of the controller by checking the true false property and accordingly redirect to homePage if the value is false.p  pI was thinking of some better way to do this, like in  Controller itself.p  pThank you,p  pM.p

Negative 8073 pI have been trying this for like the last 3 days and I still cant make it work. The WINAPI codeFindResourcecode function throws and error 1813 this means that the resource type is not found.

Is this correct or I am just taking it wrong In the resource type I tried giving EXE BIN Exehead and codeRTRCDATAcodebut nothing works, and it still gives me the same error as before. All the solutions on the web are with code.RCcode and coderesource.hcode files on codeVisual Studiocode, is there anything to work with eclipse Thanksp
Negative 8073 pIm quite new to jquery and javascript programming in general so please be patient. p  pI have an ASP.NET web user control region.ascx that contains an instance of the jquery autocomplete plugin.

I have a situation where I have two separate user controls Org.ascx and Place.ascx that each have an instance of region.ascx that are on a single asp.net page, therefor i end up with 2 instances of the above code. When this is the case only the last instance for place.ascx is initialized correctly and works. The other instance org.ascx doesnt do anything.p  pI think I may be able to get around this by putting the Initializer code above into each of the controls that needs it, essentially getting rid of my region.ascx control. I have a feeling that if I do this and make the names of the initializer functions unique it may work.p  pMy question is Am I doing this correctly Is there a way around thisp

Negative 8073 pI am making an app, and if I use it normally it works fine with no crashes. There is one activity with two fragments that are swapped, and one has two buttons on it. If the app isnt used for a while hours and the app is reopened, then if I press one of the buttons the app crashes. This only happens if I exited out of the app with the Home button, if I last exited out by pressing Back a few times then this problem doesnt occur.p  pI can also replicate this crash if I open the app, press the home button to go back to the android home screen, and press my Advanced Task Killer app button. When I open up the app again, it opens on the same fragment it left off on which is weird, Id think after using a task killer it would start fresh and if I press one of the buttons the app crashes. p  pI found out through logcat that it is passing my tempmainfrag as null when I resume the app in the following code, which becomes a problem in both codesaveButtonClickedcode and codedeleteButtonClickedcodep  precodepackage com.example.android.fragments      public class MainActivity extends FragmentActivity          implements MainListFragment.OnListSelectedListener       MainListFragment tempmainfrag     InfoFragment infofrag     int mainPosition  1       Called when the activity is first created.

Negative 8073 pI have a general question that Im having trouble grappling with about web workers. I understand that they engage in background calculations in another thread so they take off the load from the window that the user is in. p  pHowever Im confused on whether that other thread means something like having a different program running on the computer, having a separate browser open, or whether its like a new tab in the same browser. I feel that this is more of the latter case, but Im not 100 sure about that and I cant find good explanations. p  pWhat implications does this have on the limitations of what we can do with web workers p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 8073 pFor some reason, I cant modify the value of a field in Haxe. Of course, this doesnt seem to be affecting all of my fields, just this one. Heres what Im pretty sure is the applicable code.  First, in the parent classp  precodeclass TopMenu extends Sprite       public function new               super         init          private function init               var tempFieldBitmappedTextField  new BitmappedTextField File, 100, false          trace tempField.textWidth        codepre  pThen, in the child classp  precodeclass BitmappedTextField extends Sprite      private var fieldTextString     private var fieldWidthInt     private var addToStageBool     public var textWidthInt     public function new thisTextString, thisWidthInt  100, adTStgBool  true                super         fieldText  thisText         fieldWidth  thisWidth         addToStage  adTStg         textWidth  55         init          public function init              textWidth  777       codepre  pI would expect the codetracecode statement to return code777code, but instead it will always return code55code. In fact, no matter what I do, I cant seem to modify a field outside of the constructor class and then retrieve that value via the parent class. Theres something horribly simple I must be missing, but I just cant figure it out. Maybe it has to do with the way Haxe uses getters and setters Any help is appreciated, thank you.p

So the compiler does see that fieldName is applied to a field but apparently it wants a more concrete type here.  I guess having the functions remain polymorphic makes pgsqlDriver not a concrete classp  pBut the idea would be that these functions are polymorphic.  Thats the reason I chose to use a GADT here, so I could put type constraints on the parameters to these driver functions without having to repeat them in every instantiation.  The plan would be that the defined database driver could work with any Field and Table instances.  Can this simply not be done and my DatabaseDriver type would also have to be a type classp

Negative 8073 pHeres a very standard bit of code Rails 4p  pcodelt linkto Log out, logoutpath, method gt delete gtcodep  pHowever, heres a nonstandard consideration no Javascript. Without Javascript, jqueryujs doesnt get its hooks in, so the link creates a plain codeGET logoutcode, which has no route.p  pWhy Because I want to support a Tor hidden site version of the site, and I have to assume that Tor users coming most likely via the Tor Browser Bundle will have JavaScript disabled. I deliberately do not want to enable JS for them, to prevent various potential privacy leaks. I also dont want to permit XSRF attacks that would e.g. allow someone to log out my users with a GET, nor make the UI ugly with a button.p  pThe hidden site is lower functionality than the main site e.g. no payments accepted via tor, but some basic things like loginlogout really ought to work correctly.p  pWhats the best way to support thisp

Negative 8073 pIm interested in how I might send requests from a web server using Python to a constantly running C program.  Basically users should be able to send orders via their browser to the web server.  The web server then needs to forward those orders to a constantly running application written in C.  Eventually the C program should be able to send order results back to the web server who can forward the results to the users browser if theyre still connected.  p  pIve thought about having the web server record pending orders to a database which the C program polls for changes.  That doesnt seem very efficient though.  I believe it will have issues with to many users.  Is there some methodtechnology that is typically used for this type of situation  p

Negative 8073 pI received some help with this yesterday, but there are still a few problems that Im encountering with this. Basically, its a drop down menu that sits inside a header that is set to codeposition fixedcode. When viewed on a mobile device, I want the header to remain fixed, but when the menu is activated, jQuery dynamically changes the headers position to relative. That works fine, but there as I mentioned there are a few problems that I need to fix. If the menutoggle link is clicked again closing the menu, the header does not return to its previous state relative. Is there a way to do this I also notice a flicker, so lets say you scroll half way down the page, then click on the menu to open it, the page sort of jumps and does not scroll back to the top where the menu is located inside the header as it should. I would prefer a pure CSS solution, but that seems imposible. I COULD set the rules so that if its less than 499 pixels wide, the header gets positions relative, but then usability fails, as a user will have to scroll up to the top of the page to access the drop down menu.

Negative 8073 pMy plan is to develop an App which allows me to store data locally for offline use. I know there will be some data which do not need to be persisted since i can load the again.

But then i also have data i simply want to store on the device permanently without being backed up.

Negative 8073 precodeint main       Base p  new Derived     delete p     return 0  codepre  pI have some confusion, why deleting p here wont delete the derived object  Is it so that the derived object contains the subobject of base type and pointer codepcode is actually pointing to the base part  subobject of the derived object. So when codedelete pcode is run it will only be able to delete the base class part of the object of the derived class and it will have undefined behavior for the derived part destruction. This will cause memory leaks. So to avoid memory leakage we need to manage to call both base and derived destructors of the object to avoid memory leakage Is this so  Is that the reason we need Virtual destructors for  So that when the base destructor is virtual, the derived class destrutor would override the base classs destructor which is virtual. Please clarifyp

Negative 8073 pIs it possible to reuse the same transaction between multiple processes with Postgres Or any other RDBMS Is there name for such concept and does it make any sensep  pOne possible use case would be two service instances different processes modifying related set of entities within one distributed transaction.p  pFor example, imagine a website that displays music playlists. Plain users can see playlists, but editors can collaborate on playlist editing. Editors would modify lists, but viewers wouldnt see latest changes until one of editors saves commits changes.p  pThis is just illustrative example, and would take a different approach to the design, without relying on distributed transactions. Im just interested in the concept of distributed transactions and its plausability, since Im not expert in the field.p

Negative 8073 pI have a fancybox version 2.1.4 gallery of iframes that I open and then insert a right column in the parent body outside the fb iframe that display descriptions.  In order to size the iframe properly I pass in margin  [120, 340, 40, 40] in the options when initializing fancybox.  So far so good.  The right column is fixed, and fancybox resizes nicely in the space allotted to it.p  pHowever, now I would like users to be able to collapse the right column and have the fancybox iframe expand to the full page.  Getting the right column to collapse to 40px wide is easy.  However, I cant for the life of me figure out how to change the right margin of an open fancybox gallery from 340 to 60.  Theres nothing in the api, and nothing in SO or google that I can find, and reading through the source code didnt help either. Hopefully there is something simple that Im just missing, but I could use some help.p  pAs a temporary fix I pass the current object to the right column loader and modify the margins directly, then check to see if the right column is collapsed in the afterload callback.  ugly but functional.

Negative 8073 pLevel Beginner. I am currently working on sniffers with python using raw sockets. I have a general question regarding the format specifiers to be used in unpack provided by struct module. As we use this method to unpack the data according to the format specifiers specified. I have seen a lot of sniffer programmes using unpack to decode the packet information from hexadecimal form. for an example in order to extract the ethernet header information following code can be usedp  precodeethHeader  struct.unpack6s6s2s, ethernetHeader codepre  pHere the ethernetHeader is variable that contains the actual ethernet header data captured earlier from a raw socket. Now my questions is how can one know which format specifier to use for a header How can I know in advance that the ethernet addresses are in string format or in some other format Is there any documentation for this too. I read python docs related to unpack but didnt find any info. Similarly in the case of IP addresses the code is something like thisp  precodeipAddresses  struct.unpack12s4s4s, IPAddresses codepre  pHere the IPAddresses is variable that contains the actual IP addresses information captured earlier from a raw socket. Once again how can I know that I have to use strings as format specifiers 12s4s4s. Thanks.p

An example of the recurrent function is as followsp  precode    function basicFunc          var totalX  2000, totalY  2000         for var y  0 y lt totalY y              for var x  0 x lt totalX x                     Fake operation for theory                    var fakeVar  y  x                            codepre  pComparative top  precode    function eachBlockwhatToDo, totalX, totalY          for var y  0 y lt totalY y              for var x  0 x lt totalX x                    Fake operation for theory                   return whatToDo                                 function basicFunc          var totalX  2000, totalY  2000         eachoBlockvar fakeVar  y  x, totalX, totalY      codepre  pThis works fine for single lines to be passed as the codewhatToDocode parameter. How would you go about passing multiple lines to codeeachBlockcode, say if you have a bunch of operations to do instead of the one codevar FakeVarcode operationp  pstrongTLDRstrong How can you use a function call within a function to wrap the original block of code operations it performed before becoming a separate functionp

Negative 8073 pWe have Win2k8 servers running 4000 .NET 4.0 websites fine. Weve put off the Framework update for as long as we can, and are running into issues with dopostback with browser detection, that we cant work around any longer.p  pI cloned one of our servers VM and installed just the .NET 4.5.1 update Okay.p  pThe problem we now have, is that the behavior of 4.5.1 seems to have changed with regards to throwing exceptions for DLL references that are in a module, but NOT uploaded to the server. p  pFor example, we have a Support.DLL that has dotless.core.dll as a reference. This is only used in a windows service that references the support.dll, but is never used in the web applications, so the dotless.core.dll has never been uploaded and shouldnt be to the websites. p  precode Prebind state information  LOG DisplayName  dotless.Core, Version0.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyToken96b446c9e63eae34  Fullyspecified LOG Appbase  fileCinetpubroot2362Sites3168Site LOG Initial PrivatePath  Cinetpubroot2362Sites3168Sitebin Calling assembly  Support, Version2.1.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokennull. codepre  pThe .NET 4.0 framework never complained, and simply ignored these missing references. There are no references in web.configs.p  pIf I uninstall the 4.5.1 framework update, the problem goes away. So this does appear to be a behavior change in the update.  Is there a registrymachine.config option to disable this new behaviorp  pNot ideal, but putting this DLL into the GAC resolves the problem, but we dont want to start copying DLLs to the servers when they are never used.p  pWe have nearly 4000 websites that will be affected when the 4.5.1 update is applied. Part of the reason weve not done the updates for so long.  Never as straightforward as MS would like us to believep  pMany thanks in advance,p  pPaulp

With the same prototype, binary semaphore program took just 2.8 ms.  This  is understood because binary semaphore is lightweight  and does not have many features like a mutex priority inversion, ownership etc.  p  pHowever, I removed one task and ran the above program  without contention.  Since there is no contention, the task t1 just gets the mutex , executes the critical section and then releases the mutex. Same with Binary semaphore.br For the timings, mutex I got 3.35 ms and binary semaphore  4 ms. p  pIm surprised to see mutex is faster than binary semaphore when there is no contention.br Is this expected  or am I missing somethingp  pAny help is appreciated.  p

Negative 8073 pSo i have made a deck of cards that can be turned around by pressing them. For some reason on iOs the cards ignore the zindex. I have an example here a hrefhttpdaviddf77.seventyseven.axc.nlflip relnofollowhttpdaviddf77.seventyseven.axc.nlflipap  pSo lets say the card on top has zindex 99 the card underneath it has a zindex of 98. Why does the transform transition cause the zindex to not apply anymore It seems that during the transition the zindex gets put to 0. And then when the transition has finished its correct again.p  pI tried a lot of different things to fix this, like adding a transformorigin, translate3d, zindex transition etc. But nothing seems to work.p

It looks like my error is somewhere else.p  pMy app is configured like thisp  precodeapp.configurefunction      app.setport, process.env.PORT  3000     app.setviews, dirname  views     app.setview engine, jade     app.useexpress.logger     app.useexpress.cookieParser     app.useexpress.bodyParser     app.useexpress.methodOverride     app.useexpress.session         path ,         secret very secret           app.usepassport.initialize     app.usepassport.session     app.useapp.router     app.useexpress.staticdirname  public  codepre  pOnce passport verified the twitter account its redirected to this sitep  precodeapp.getauthtwittercallback,     passport.authenticatetwitter,          failureRedirect login     ,     functionreq, res          res.redirect         console.logpopulate session         populateSessionreq, res      codepre  pThis works, as Im seeing the populate session output in the console if Im logged in.p  pThe codepopulateSessioncode looks like thisp  precodefunction populateSessionreq, res      User.findOne         twitterID req.user.id     , functionerr, result          if result               Store data to session             req.session.twitterAccessToken  result.twitterAccessToken             req.session.twitterAccessTokenSecret  result.twitterAccessTokenSecret             req.session.lastfmAccountName  result.lastfmAccountName              console.login session   req.session.lastfmAccountName                codepre  pin session is printed the right way. So the session itself works. Now my problem is that I want to have access to my session variables in routes because I want to pass them to my view templates like thisp  precodeapp.getaccount, ensureAuthenticated, functionreq, res      console.logreq.session     console.loglastfm nick   req.session.lastfmAccountName     res.renderaccount,          user req.user,         lastfmnick req.session.lastfmAccountName      codepre  pThats where Im running into the problems. codereq.sessioncode contains all the twitter fields passport is populating it with but codereq.session.lastfmAccountNamecode is codeundefinedcode.p  pAny idea whats wrong there or is there a better way to pass variables to the view I feel like its not a good idea to have DB queries for the fields in all my routes if it could just be stored in the session.p  pThanksp
Negative 8073 pI plan to submit a portlet plugin to Liferay Marketplace. I would like to include an icon, but i have not yet found a guidance to do this. I noticed other portlet plugins have a liferayreleng.properties, and an image is placed in WEBINFrelengicons90x90.png. I also found out in the source code of a hrefhttpdocs.liferay.comportal6.1javadocsallsrchtmlcomliferayportaltoolsPluginsSummaryBuilder.html relnofollowPluginSummaryBuildera, it was looking for an icon at WEBINFrelengicons90x90.png. So i added my .png icon here with the recommended size 90 x 90. So far, so good.p  pBut when i deploy the application .war in my portal, this icon is not taken into consideration, in the application manager screen the default image is displayed instead such kaleo example below. I noticed it is the same for some existing marketplace plugins, for example see the screenshot attached the knowledgebase portlet has its custom icon but Kaleoweb has the default one, though they both have an image defined in their respective WEBINFrelengicons90x90.png.p  pSo here are my questionsp  p1 Is there a documentation, or any blog post describing how to add an icon Otherwise could someone advicep  p2 Why some icons are not displayed in the application manager, such Kaleo examplep  pThanks in advancep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLpz3Z.png altenter image description herep
Negative 8073 pOkay so basically Im a little bit stumped. This question is regarding the JDBC driver. Basically we own a server that is hosted on this driver, and its running MYSQL. We are using coldfusion as our language of choice. We have a GET parameter codelangcode and injecting the character  into it prompts the error codeYou have an error in your SQL syntax check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use nearcode and no other character causes this error. I am sort of worried here. Can anyone tell me how an attacker would approach an sql injection attack into this parameter So I can understand how I can filter it because in my code I am properly filtering pregmatch on codecode character and yet I still get this error. How would I be able to inject this parameter Can someone point me to a guide or something, or if its even possible. Just so I can rest in piece assuming its not. But anyhow if this information is necessary the mysql version is code5.1.30code and the exact driver name is codeMySQLAB JDBC Drivercode. Thanks for taking your time to help me outp

Would Equals be better than using a method for this  Also, I am not sure how to call the method so I see the true or false values. If a duplicate is found, it should loop and ask user to reenter.

If they want to clear the filter and type something different they can tap it again.p  pHowever, if they are typing into the box and make a mistake I would expect the keyboard to remain in view because the search view already has focus.p  pSo in a nutshell I wantp  ol liIf the user is typing in the search view and taps cancelclear, then the keyboard stays in focus.li liIf the user is not currently typing in the search view ie. the keyboard has disappeared from view, then tapping the clear button should just clear the query and NOT bring the keyboard back into view.li ol  pI know I can use the codesetOnCloseListenercode event to hook into when the clearclose button is pressed, but I dont know how to stop it from showing the soft keyboard as mentioned in point 2.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pMaybe there is a way I can have the search view lose focus How do I achieve this result Thanks.p

Well, the red has to go somewhere or the black height of the tree would be affected, and the only known node that we are sure can be made red is that particular child. I dont quite remember how I figured out the red sibling cases, but Im reasonably sure that alcohol was involved.  strongThe second red sibling case looks at the inner child of the sibling. This child cannot be a null pointer exercise whystrong, so we simply test one of its children and act depending on which one is red. If the outer child is red, we perform a double rotation, color the new parent black, its right child black, and its left child redp blockquote  pHow did the author conclude that the inner child of the sibling cannot be a null pointer Why that particular child cannot be null pointer  Why not the other child p

Negative 8073 pI am trying to generate an editable list using codengrepeatcode.  I want to remind the user to update any edits before moving on, so I am using codengformcode to create nested forms on the fly because the documentation says I can then use validation on these dynamically created inputs.p  pWhile that seems to work within the HTML, I dont see how to access those dynamically created forms and related validation fields in the controller. Specifically, when the user changes the input I use the form dirty property to bring up a button to tell the user to commit the changes.  So far, so good.  However, once the changes are committed I want to codesetPristinecode on the field to indicate that the changes have been set.  There may be other ways of ensuring that changes are committed on each input before I allow the main form committed, but this was the best I could come up with.p  pUnfortunately, even though the documentation says that if I name the ngform it will be propagated to the codescopecode object, I cant find a way to access it.  codescope.dynamicformcode is undefined.p  pHere is a plunker showing what I meanp  pa hrefhttpplnkr.coeditL9rNMNwaVm8noNZeKwnCplnkap  pThanksp  p[EDIT] Just to add to the issue, what does work for this specific example is to add to the codengclickcode on the dynamically created inputp  precodengclicknamesForm.name.setPristineclean codepre  pBut I still dont have access to the dynamically created form in the controller.  I would like, for example, to add a watcher to the codenamesForm.name.pristinecode so that I can set the codemainForm.setValidityfalsecode whenever the subform is codedirtycode to prevent the user from submitting the main form until all subform changes have been committed.p  pSo in a nutshell, the issue is how to access in a parent controller the validation values of a dynamically created nested ngFormp

Negative 8073 pI have set up longpolling with ajax to monitor an everincreasing JSON feed.

However my counter, the codeglobalLengthcode which is essentially just the length of the JSON feed does not update after I first one open the page.p  pOnce or twice I have noticed that if I directly go to the JSON feed page, the page doing the longpolling will get the new image urls.p  pAlso, refreshing the page doing the longpolling usually gets the new JSON feed items.

Negative 8073 pI apologize for the simple question, but I am a bit confused.p  pI am creating my first Android app. Functinally I am done. I am now working on the UI. According to a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comdesignstyleiconography.html relnofollowthisa, I am required to provide multiple icons to support different screens and I understand this part.p  pSo I created a vector image, and was about to export it to generate a number of icons to support multiple resolutions. However, I could not find the require DPI. According to a hrefhttpwww.tivix.comblogperfectresourceimagesizedpiforanyandroiddevice relnofollowthisa, I am supposed to support different DPIs, but the article does not explain how to do that.p  pCan you please advise me on how to select the proper DPI Does it even matter I thought it does, but maybe my understanding is wrong.p  pThanks.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pJust to clarify my question. When I am exporting an image from a vector to a raster image, I have to select its dimension so in my case, 400px X 200px, and its dpi. So what should I choose for DPI Is that the same DPI that will create different icon sizes I am confused. Thanks again.p

Negative 8073 pI want to change increase the degree of parallelism used by Powershell Workflow ie. the codeworkflowcode keyword in Powershell 3. Im using the codeparallelcode keyword as well as codeforeach parallelcode, but the default degree 5 is not enough. p  pIve determined the setting I need to change to increase the degree of parallelism is codeMaxSessionsPerWorkflowcode which can be found on the a hrefhttptechnet.microsoft.comenuslibraryhh849862.aspx relnofollowNewPSWorkflowExecutionOptiona cmdlet, however I cannot figure out how to apply that setting to the current console session ie. what you get when you just start codepowershell.execode.p  pIve been able to apply that setting to a remoting session by creating a new Session Configuration, then starting a new Session using that Configuration, then running commands in that Session, but thats a horrible solution that requires remoting to be enabled on the machine and to be running as Administrator. a hrefhttpwww.getcodesamples.comsrc838AA02D792E7326 relnofollowHeres an examplea of this horrible technique.p  pIve tried changing the default codemicrosoft.powershell.workflowcode Session Configuration in the hope that it would affect a standard Powershell console session, but it does not seem to.p  pHow can I set the codeMaxSessionsPerWorkflowcode setting for a normal powershell.exe console session, without using any remotingp

Negative 8073 pIve been provided with aprox 45 million images of old documents my company has decided to delete. Were trying to go paperless but Im facing an issue Ive been unable to fully comprehend. Ive always used SQL for this amount of data but now I only have images. Ive already bought ABBYY Fine Reader OCR and its currently working on OCRing all the files to Word or PDF. My problem is theyd like to search within this massive amount of data in less than 710 seconds and get all the results with a download link to the original image of the file.p  pI read about NoSQL but it seems to me its not the best approach as Id have to create a table with no schema whatsoever and just add the entire text of each image with a corresponding Page number and a link to the original file.

Negative 8073 pIm a beginner with SQL Server. For a project I need CDC to be turned on. I copy the cdc data to another archive database and after that the CDC tables can be cleaned immediately. So the retention time doesnt need to be high, I just put it on 1 minute and when the cleanup job runs after the retention time is already fulfilled it appears that it only deleted a few records the oldest ones. Why didnt it delete everything Sometimes it doesnt delete anything at all. After running the job a few times, the other records get deleted. I find this strange because the retention time has long passed. p  pI set the retention time at 1 minute I actually wanted 0 but it was not possible and didnt change the threshold  5000. I disabled the schedule since I want the cleanup job to run immediately after the CDC records are copied to my archive database and not particularly on a certain time.p  pMy logic for this idea was that for example there will be updates in the afternoon. The task to copy CDC records to archive database should run at 200 AM, after this task the cleanup job gets called. So because of the minimum retention time, all the CDC records should be removed by the cleanup job. The retention time has passed after allp  pI just tried to see what happened when I set up a schedule again in the job, like how CDC is meant to be used in general. After the time has passed I checked the CDC table and turns out it also only deletes the oldest record. So what am I doing wrong p  pI made a workaround where I made a new job with the task to delete all records in the CDC tables and disabled the entire default CDC cleanup job.

Negative 8073 pI am trying to draw an image that is larger than the screen, and let the user scroll around it. The image is some graphs that are calculated by my code from some data. This is in Android using Java.p  pWhat I want is a View actually a SurfaceView that can be scrolled by the user. I have tried putting a SurfaceView inside a ScrollView but the whole image drawn by the SurfaceView is very large and so a there are performance issues as my app is drawing the whole SurfaceView when it should only need to do the part that is in the viewport and b my app crashes with dimensions too large... out of memory errors.p  pIt would be best for me if the View could implement scrolling vertical only and then pass the yvalue to my code so it could draw the visible part of my image in the viewport.p  pAlternatively I could capture the mouse events and calculate the yvalue myself.p  pDoes anyone have any code so that I can do thisp  pUpdate I should clarify, the image is drawn by my program code using Canvas.drawLine and the like. I can calculate which parts of the image fit within my viewport, provided I have the state of the scroll as a yvalue, and I can calculate the absolute ycoordinate of each point by subtracting scroll yvalue. What I need is something that works to find when the user scrolls the image and what the resulting yvalue is. A scrollbar would also be nice.p  pUpdate I am using SurfaceView so that I can update the image from another Thread and so improve user interface performance.p

Negative 8073 pI am planning on creating a website with one of my friends.  Both of us know next to  nothing of coding and programming.  We are planning to display hundreds, potentially thousands of images on this website. strongThese images will have a short descriptionstrong, and will not be user uploaded, but we may potentially want to implement an option to save the favorite images.p  pThere will be a button that randomizes the images shown strongone image at a timestrong. Users will click this button and it will randomize from all the images, displaying a new one on the screen strongreplacing the old onestrong.  Is it possible to write code that makes it so it will display a new random image, but not repeat the same image until it has cycled through all of the images potentially thousandsp  pJust from browsing the web, looking at tutorials, and reading some other stuff weve have a general idea of what needs to be done.  We need to strongstore the images as files on a serverstrong, and strongstore the description of the images and file path on a databasestrong. To create the button function we use javascript and write a script that will randomize. Someone mentioned JSON but I dont know what that is.p  pAre we on the right track We are both currently looking into strongPHPstrong. Although we have a general idea of what needs to be done, we dont know where to start as far as tying this whole project together.We are trying to figure out how to start saving the images as files, and implementing them into the database but dont really know how.p  ptldr We would like some guidance on where to go with this, how we can possibly tie all of this together, and if we have the right idea of what to do.p  pLearning this stuff out of the blue can seem kind of overwhelming at first, that is why Im extremely grateful for all the advice and answers.  p

If the RequestURI refers to an already existing   resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified   version of the one residing on the origin server. If the RequestURI   does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of   being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the   origin server can create the resource with that URI. If a new resource   is created, the origin server MUST inform the user agent via the 201   Created response. If an existing resource is modified, either the   200 OK or 204 No Content response codes SHOULD be sent to indicate   successful completion of the request. If the resource could not be   created or modified with the RequestURI, an appropriate error   response SHOULD be given that reflects the nature of the problem. The   recipient of the entity MUST NOT ignore any Content e.g.   ContentRange headers that it does not understand or implement and   MUST return a 501 Not Implemented response in such cases.p blockquote  pFrom my understanding of REST, books are resources and should be handled through their own endpoint and an update to the catalog should only be used to add existing books to a catalog, not create them. p  pSo in this scenario a book that does not exist would be ignorednot added to the catalog until a create request is submitted to create the book. p  pThis would mean the user would send a POST book to create the book, followed by a PUT to catalog with the book in the request to add it to the catalog.p

Negative 8073 pBelow is the progress on my mobiletouch camera movement system, written in c under the Unity Engine. It includes basic pan, and pinchtozoom functions.

The problem seems to be using codethis.paramscode on the codetemplatecode line.  This solution is not perfect but posting for anyone who may run into a similar problem.  As far as further variables in the url like admin12345 it seems they would need additional routes and cant be fully dynamic as a  can not go into the params and the router would look for a route and return notFound unless you can an explicit matching route.

Negative 8073 pI have a piece of code that looks like thisp  precode        var schedEvents  dataContext.ScheduledEvents.Wherese gt eventParents.Containsse.HierarchyItem.Id         var schedEventsEnum  schedEvents.GetEnumerator         while schedEventsEnum.MoveNext                      string eventID  schedEventsEnum.Current.Id.ToString             string eventName  schedEventsEnum.Current.EventName.ToString              jsonStr   id    eventID  , text    eventName  ,          codepre  peventParents is built up before this, but its just a list of hierarchical item IDs used for the comparison the aim is to find all events that are children of an ID in that list.  That part seems to work fine.  The first line of the code hits the database once and pulls everything I want.  However, once it gets to the GetEnumerator part it starts hitting the database again which is what Im trying to avoid.  But Im not sure why this might be happening.p  pIm doing basically the same thing earlier in the code to go through the Hierarchical items and it just hits the db once so Im not sure why getting the enumerator for this one might be different.p

Negative 8073 pId like to do something very much like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3796025fillsvgpathelementwithabackgroundimageFill SVG path element with a backgroundimagea except that the solution offered there will tile the image to fill the the entire background area.  I dont want that.  If the image doesnt fill either the entire height or the entire width, then Id just like it to center within the path shape and let that be that.  If I try to restrict the behavior by changing the heightwidth attributes, then the rendering just scales the image until it fills at least one of the dimensions.  p  pI guess this behavior somewhat makes sense since it uses patterns.  I can see that what I want is not really a pattern per se.  I just want to slap an image in the middle of my shape just as it is, not make a pattern out of it.  However, I do want the shape boundaries defined by my SVG path to cut off the rendering of the image, whenever the images size extends past those boundaries.  I dont know else to get that behavior besides the use of a pattern for the fill attribute, as is done in the answer to that question.p  pIn a similar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11496734addabackgroundimagepngtoasvgcircleshapeAdd a background image .png to a SVG circle shapea , the user at the very bottom seems to indicate that he used a filter rather than a pattern to achieve what Im seeking to achieve.  However, when I try that, no regard is paid to the actual shape during rendering.  The image is rendered without any regard to the shape boundaries, which seems pretty much useless.p  pIs there any way in SVG to get that patternlike background image behavior but without actually tiling the image into a patternp

Negative 8073 pHi all, I have a question about recurrence relation Big O notation.  I was given a homework assignment that asked me to give the Big O notation of some of my old code Algorithms that I came up with for previous homework assignments. Sadly, I have not yet taken a course in Finite Mathematics so this is new to me. I managed to figure out three of the four Algorithms that I used.  However, I am stuck on the fourth algorithms. This method is a recursive method and is coded in Java. I have, really, spent hours trying to figure this out, and Ive watched lots of videos and read lots of articles on Big O notation but sadly cant get it. Any help would be great Here is the code p  precodeArrayListltFacebookUsergt getRecommendationsFacebookUser e      FacebookUser rootUser  userCallForList.get0       ifrootUser.getFriends.isEmpty  e.getFriends.isEmpty         return returnHash           forFacebookUser hold  e.getFriends         if hold.equalsrootUser ampamp addHashhold             getRecommendationshold                       return returnHash  codepre  pstrongNote About the Codestrong The method takes a FacebookUser as an argument. The method returns an ArrayList that contains all of the friends of the FacebookUser that is passed into it plus the result of calling the same getRecommendations method on all of that FacebookUsers friends. It does not add anyone to the list of recommendations if they are already on it and does not add the FacebookUser E.I rootUser that is calling it As that could lead to an infinite loop. I use a HashSet as my collection and then I have to change it back to an ArrayList. p

What I am trying to do is use these tables to come up with a unified table where both product description desc1 and desc2 are known. Is there a way to do this in SQL I have had some luck with smaller tables since I know that a site from T1 with 1 order cannot match up with any descriptions from T2 with 1 order as that would leave 0 orders left over. So in these tables for example we know that PK 4 from T1 matches with a portion of PK5 from T2 because when we try to subtract PK4 in T1  from PK 1 in T2 it leaves us with 63 lines, more that could fit in any of the leftover sites.  Basically Ive been trying to solve this like a sodoku puzzle but I thought that I could do something in SQL that would be faster and more elegant.  I have looked into cross joins that make a cartesian product of both tables but that doesnt seem to be working as some of the sites will need to be broken up to match up with the rows of the product descriptions.  I can make an algorithm to spot the obvious matches to get it to the point where I could just do every permutation of products, but perhaps Im overthinking it and there is an easier way.p  pThis is a tricky one, but Im sure someone has run into this problem before, I cant find how they solved it though.p

Negative 8073 pId like extend Windsors Typed Factory Facility to create a factory which retains some state, e.g. properties on the factory itself that will be used to resolve dependencies on the things the factory creates. Kind of like a Typed Builder Facility.p  pSo, I would define my factory interface like so...p  precodepublic interface IFishBuilder      string FishType  get set      double SwimSpeed  get set       IFish CreateFishstring name     void ReleaseFishIFish fish  codepre  pThis would create components like this...p  precodeclass Fish  IFish      public Fishstring name, string fishType, double swimSpeed            codepre  pAnd be used like so...p  precodeIFishBuilder b b.SwimSpeed  50 b.FishType  Shark b.CreateFishFrank b.CreateFishBob b.SwimSpeed  95 b.CreateFishUsain codepre  pNot a great example, but lets not worry too much about the use case, beyond understanding that the initialised factory will be passed to someone else that will do the creation, without understanding how it had been initialised.p  pIve made some steps in the right direction  well actually, it works OK already... However, Im pretty sure there should be a simpler way to achieve this. What I have done so far is attach a second interceptor to the factory proxy, which intercepts the setter and getter properties on the interface. My original plan was that my custom codeITypedFactoryComponentSelectorcode for the factory would then read the properties from the interceptor attached to the proxy object.p  pWhere this all falls down, of course, is that the codeITypedFactoryComponentSelectorcode interface doesnt give any way to access the proxy object that implements the factory upon which the factory method was called. This means I have no path back to calling the property getters to read the factories properties back in for the codeGetArgumentscode to access. Let me try and explain that again. The component selectors function is defined as...p  precodeFuncltIKernelInternal, IReleasePolicy, objectgt SelectComponentMethodInfo method, Type type, object[] arguments codepre  pYou get access to the method on the factory emclassem, the emtypeem and the arguments passed to the method, but not the factory emobjectem itself. Before you get clever with circular dependencies, my factories are transient.p  pMy workaround for this currently is to access the Typed Factorys interceptor in my interceptor via the proxy, and then grab hold of the component selector which therefore needs to be made transient. I then poke the property values into a dictionary held by the component selector effectively, using the component selector as the storage backing the factorys properties. However, this feels like a lot of hacky crosscoupling, which I would rather avoid.p  pSo, now I am looking for suggestions as to how to improve this.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 8073 pIm currently developing an application that uses a codeUIWebViewcode to display some content. It used to work fine with codeUIWebViewcode, but we decided to switch to codeWKWebViewcode when we raised the OS requirement to 8.1. We noticed a huge improvement in performance, but some simple think that used to work fine, started failing now. After some research, I managed to see whats going on  but I dont see how to fix it. I was wondering if someone could lend me a hand on this...p  pThe URL our webview loads takes quite a lot of time to finish the job, so before starting the request we load a static spinner so the user doesnt feel like the app has gone nuts. The load cycle for that static content is already tuned up, so we dont start the URL request until the static content has been correcty loaded. This works fine, as long as the user doesnt rotate the device. This is what can be seenp  pI had to change the view for privacy purposes. Im not the owner of this code, after all p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.coma3TNb.png altenter image description herep  pIm using this html code to test the size. The bodys background color is dark gray, and the ugly light gray box expands to the 100 of the width, substracting the margins. So far so good. But if the user rotates the device, this is what happensp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combb6uE.png altenter image description herep  pThis is creepy, since apparently the bodys stetching to match the maximum width, but the inner div is handling a wrong relative size. This goes on as long as the request is being processed. When I force a timeout to make the request fail, the codeWKWebViewcode rerenders and shows its correct appearancep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comBQ7Zo.png altenter image description herep  pOnce I discovered this I tried, without success, to subscribe to the rotation observer and force rerenders on the webview byp  ul liCalling codeviewNeedsDisplaycode for both the codeUIWebViewcode and the codeUIScrollViewcode insideli liResizing the codeUIWebViewcodeli liRepositioning the codeUIScrollViewcode contentli ul  pSo, my conclusions so farp  ul liThis didnt happen on an codeUIWebViewcode, just on the new codeWKWebViewcode I tested this again, confirmedli liLooks like codeWKWebViewcode doesnt render views correctly while its on loading statusli ul  pDoes somebody know if theres a way to fix this Something like one magical property Im missing that comes disabled by default I dont want to think they broke this part when they remade the webview...

First VC is simply a Navigation Controller pointing to a UITableViewController.p  pin the second row the first VC is the datasource delegate for the UIPageVIewController. The one next to it is the PageViewController, The two UITableViews next to it is the pages that are in the UIPageViewController.

Negative 8073 pIm currently working on a project using THREE.js to build a 3d environment to represent a mountain range.  For the purposes of this project, Im taking input from the user in the form of a list of contour lines, and to improve the quality of the output, I want to know what the spine of the mountain looks like.  p  pTo represent that, I used an algorithm that produces Voronoi cells, found here a hrefhttpsgithub.comgorhillJavascriptVoronoi relnofollowhttpsgithub.comgorhillJavascriptVoronoia and now Im trying to trim the output to only show edges of the voronoi diagram contained in a polygon.  The problem is that Im simply using raycasting from each vertex of each edge in the diagram, and if both cross the edge of the polygon an odd number of times it is inside the polygon, and anything else is excluded.  I cant figure out why the output isnt representing that, and I think its a problem with how Im using the THREE.Raycaster.  Heres a simplified snipped of my code that is supposed to handle it.p  precodevar raycaster  new THREE.Raycaster raycaster.linePrecision  0 for i  0 i lt diagram.edges.length  1 i      raycaster.setnew THREE.Vector3diagram.edges[i].v1.x, 0, diagram.edges[i].v1.y, new THREE.Vector31, 0, 0.normalize     var p1intersects  raycaster.intersectObjectpolygon     raycaster.setnew THREE.Vector3diagram.edges[i].v2.x, 0, diagram.edges[i].v2.y, new THREE.Vector31, 0, 0.normalize     var p2intersects  raycaster.intersectObjectpolygon     ifp1intersects.length  2  1 ampamp p2intersects.length  2  1          output.pushdiagram.edges[i]       codepre  pdiagram.edges holds all the edges generated by the voronoi diagram algorithm, polygon is an instance of THREE.line with 50 vertices, and I chose the direction vector arbitrarily since this method should work in any direction.  If anyone has ideas about why this is giving me inconsistent results, Id love any input at all.p

Negative 8073 pI am running TFS 2013 Update 4, Release Management Client Update 4, Release Management Server Update 4, and Update 4 Deployment Agents. I am using ReleaseTfvcTemplate.12.xml.p  pWhen a developer checks in code, TFS Build compiles the code, and if it completes then it is released to the DEV stage. This works fine. However, turning on emails creates a problem. p  pLets say I need to notify 10 people of a deployment and then send those same 10 people approval emails after the deployment is accepted, which it automatically is. Thats 20 emails.p  pI turned on verbose logging on the RM server and I see that each email takes 30 seconds to send. They send one at a time, one after the other. So it takes ten minutes to send twenty emails.p  pThe emails start sending as soon as the deployment starts. The actual deployment usually takes around 1 minute. Release Management marks the build as deployed and keeps sending the deploying and approval emails. Meanwhile the TFS Build Configuration log is stuck waiting atp  pProcess each ConfigurationsToRelease Release the build Run the Release Management build process for the current configruationp  pIf a deployment finishes its emails because they are turned off or there are only 34 to send, then the TFS Build Configuration log completes the release and the build is marked successful. However, TFSBuild will only wait 5 minutes at the Release the build part of the ReleaseTfvcTemplate workflow. If it takes longer than 5 minutes to send 20 emails, which it does, the build fails. How do I increase this timeout I have upped the timeout on every componenttool I could find in Release Management. I even changed some web.config timeout settings.p  pThe end result is I end up with deployed code, Release Management thinks everything went fine, and TFS Build thinks the build failed.p  pEditp  pHere are some lines I pulled from the verbose RM server logs.

Negative 8073 pLets say I have about half of million records in table A. Of course table A is joined with table B, C, etc. Now I have to fetch entities from table A which meet my criteria. My criteria consists of about 2030 rules e.g. name in table A has to be like something or date from table B for joined record from table A with ID1 should be earlier than today. I see three solutionsp  ol liWrite native query and put parameters from my criteria. But in this case I will join so many tables that it doesnt seem to me as a good example.li liFetch all records from table A and then check in Java every rule for each record. But this seems for me as the worst possible solution.li liUse JPA Criteria. But to be honest I do not know how efficient they are while there are so many records and so many joined tables. Whats more it seems to me like working with Criteria can be a little irritating when I have so many rules to match.li ol  pMaybe there is another better solution to my problem but I cannot see it now. I need to add that I need these fetched entities stored in Java collection because when they are all fetched then I have to work with them e.g. generate report or create some updates in DB basing on these information.p  pI hope I described my problem clear and I will be thankful for every tip how to optimize such query.p

Negative 8073 pIm running multiple Node.js Server on different ports and using Websocket in my client to connect with these different servers. Clients are making Ajax calls without websocket also using given server ports and everything is working fine.p  pNow the problem is that because Im using nonstandard ports to run multiple node.js server so while making calls from client side, they are being blocked by firewall. So I want to introduce an Apache proxy in between and send all the retests to apache on standard port 80 and then interact with multiple Node.js servers in the background. I tried to explain existing and desired senario in attached file.p  pNeed your help to have appropriate Apache proxy configuration to make it work. a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comhJwc9.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhJwc9.png altenter image description hereap
Negative 8073 pIve created a codeBookServicecode that is used for storing codeaddcode, getting codegetAllcode and removing coderemovecode books. Now I want to use this BookService inside my controller to publish some methods that I can later use in my view. My controller looks like the followingp  precodeapp.controllerBookController, [BookService, scope, functionBookService, scope     scope.addBook  function  BookService.add    scope.getAllBooks  function  BookService.getAll     scope.removeBook  function  BookService.remove   ] codepre  pAs you can see, the controller is just a proxy that forwards the method calls to the service. Is this in general bad practice And is there a better way to solve that using codeAngular.jscode Calling the service directly from the view without a controller seems, to me like a bigger problem.p
Negative 8073 pI have a venues model, and wish to store trading hours within my Postgres db. I am trying to work out the best way to do this so that i can check if the time has passed on any given day and display that the venue is now closed.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how best to achieve this, and then also list the days out i.e. Monday 8.00am  5.30pm, Tuesday 8.00am  5.30pm etc..p

Negative 8073 pI am working on a nice tool, which requires the ematomicem swap of two different 64bit values. On the amd64 architecture it is possible with the codeXCHGQcode instruction see here in a hrefhttpsupport.amd.comTechDocs24594.pdf relnofollowdoca, warning it is a long pdf.p  pCorrespondingly, gcc has some atomic builtins which would ideally do the same, as it is visible for example a hrefhttpsgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocsgcc005f005fatomicBuiltins.html relnofollowherea.p  pUsing these 2 docs I produced the following simple C function, for the atomic swapping of two, 64bit valuesp  precodevoid theExchangeu64 a, u64 b    atomicexchangea, b, b, ATOMICSEQCST  codepre  pBtw, it wasnt really clear to me, why needs an atomic exchange 3 operands.p  pIt was to me a little bit fishy, that the gcc codeatomicexchangecode macro uses 3 operands, so I tested its asm output. I compiled this with a codegcc O6 masmintel Scode and Ive got the following outputp  precode.LHOTB0         .p2align 4,,15         .globl  theExchange         .type   theExchange, function theExchange .LFB16         .cfistartproc         mov     rax, QWORD PTR [rsi]         xchg    rax, QWORD PTR [rdi]  WTF          mov     QWORD PTR [rsi], rax         ret         .cfiendproc .LFE16         .size   theExchange, .theExchange         .section        .text.unlikely codepre  pAs we can see, the result function contains not only a single data move, but three different data movements. Thus, as I understood this asm code, this function wont be really atomic.p  pHow is it possible Maybe I misunderstood some of the docs I admit, the gcc builtin doc wasnt really clear to me.p

Negative 8073 pCame across a fairly strange bit of Safari behavior today. p  pSo I have a  element, with a poster attribute set. p  pIn Safari, the video is hidden when I visit the page in my dev environment localhost. I am able to see the video by either removing the poster attribute, or setting the zindex of the video element to be higher than anything else on the page. p  pThus it seems like whats happening is the video is stuck behind the poster image, but that should be impossible from what I understand of how the poster is supposed to work. p  pTo complicate matters further, this is not an issue in staging or live environments i.e. on an external web server  ONLY on localhost in dev. p  pThoughtsp

Negative 8073 pOften Xcode build become messy, so I frequently use codeCleancode and recodeBuildcode my project. The project depends on several open source projects, which is managed by cocoapod.p  pThe problem is that when I use codeCleancode kbdKkbd, the entire workspace is cleaned, so all of the cocoapoddependencies are rebuilt, which takes most of the build time. But in most of the case, I just want only my own project is cleaned. How do I do thisp
Negative 8073 pI have just noticed that if I have 2 tag helpers targeting the same element, both can be executed. The order in which they are executed depends on the order in which they are registered in strongViewImports.cshtmlstrong.p  pFor example, I can create another tag helper for the anchor elementp  precode[TargetElementa, Attributes  foo] public class FooTagHelper  TagHelper      public override void ProcessTagHelperContext context, TagHelperOutput output              Get the url from href attribute generated in the default AnchorTagHelper         var url  output.Attributes[href].Value.ToString          ...       codepre  pUse it as follows notice I am also adding attributes of the default anchor helper like codeaspcontrollercodep  precodelta classmenu aspcontrollerHome aspactionIndex foogtFooltagt codepre  pIf this helper is registered in ViewImports.cshtml strongafterstrong the default ASP onesp  ul liWhenever codeProcesscode is called, the codeTagHelperOutputcode already contains the stronghrefstrong generated by the default a hrefhttpsgithub.comaspnetMvcblobdevsrcMicrosoft.AspNet.Mvc.TagHelpersAnchorTagHelper.cs relnofollowcodeAnchorTagHelpercodea. I could also update the anchor generated by the default tag helper in any way I like.li ul  pstrongIs there any degree of control over this behaviorstrongp  pYou might want to decide whether or not to execute further helpers targeting the same element As if emsealingem your output. You might also want to allow other helpers, but make sure some attribute wasnt modified.p
