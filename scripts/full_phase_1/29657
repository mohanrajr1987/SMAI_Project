Negative 29657 pI have a unique development situation and would like some input from others.p  pI have a situation where I need to load loose xaml files within a rich client application. A given loose xaml file may have references to an assembly not currently loaded in memory  so the referenced assembly is loaded before the loading the loose xaml. The loose xaml and tied assemblies are stored on different backend servers which are downloaded to the client and loaded dynamically.p  pThe loose xaml andor assemblies are version specific and unfortunately the application can not be shutdown between rendering xaml.strongv1strong with assembly.strongv1strong from server A  and xaml.strongv1strong with assembly.strongv2strong on server B.  Both assemblies use the same namespace declaration so older assemblies can still  work with newer ones for any given loose xaml.p  pThe problem is, I do not get a reference to assembly.v2 if I load xaml.v2 which contains references to newer features in assembly.v2.p  pI obviously cannot unload assembly.v1 from the app domain and Im not sure if I can reference items in xaml that are loaded within a different app domain through marshalling.p  pAny Ideas other than using different namespace referencesp

Negative 29657 pI have to copy a bunch of data from one database table into another. I cant use SELECT ... INTO because one of the columns is an identity column. Also, I have some changes to make to the schema. I was able to use the export data wizard to create an SSIS package, which I then edited in Visual Studio 2005 to make the changes desired and whatnot. Its certainly faster than an INSERT INTO, but it seems silly to me to download the data to a different computer just to upload it back again. Assuming that I am correct that thats what the SSIS package is doing. Is there an equivalent to BULK INSERT that runs directly on the server, allows keeping identity values, and pulls data from a table as far as I can tell, BULK INSERT can only pull data from a filep  pEdit I do know about IDENTITYINSERT, but because there is a fair amount of data involved, INSERT INTO ... SELECT is kinda of slow. SSISBULK INSERT dumps the data into the table without regards to indexes and logging and whatnot, so its faster. Of course creating the clustered index on the table once its populated is not fast, but its still faster than the INSERT INTO...SELECT that I tried in my first attemptp  pEdit 2 The schema changes include but are not limited to the following 1. Splitting one table into two new tables. In the future each will have its own IDENTITY column, but for the migration I think it will be simplest to use the identity from the original table as the identity for the both new tables. Once the migration is over one of the tables will have a onetomany relationship to the other. 2. Moving columns from one table to another. 3. Deleting some cross reference tables that only cross referenced 1to1. Instead the reference will be a foreign key in one of the two tables. 4. Some new columns will be created with default values. 5. Some tables arent changing at all, but I have to copy them over due to the put it all in a new DB request.p

Negative 29657 pIm need some help writing an algorithm in CC Although an language example would suffice. The purpose is a containerarray, which allows insertion at any index.

Negative 29657 pIm just starting to learn CSS. A way I like to learn is to copy source code from a site I admire, and then sort of rebuild it myself to learn how it was done. I am not using that site, or stealing it  I am just practicing from it. For example, I will take various s from the style sheet and then play with it in my own page to see how it works, etc. Sometimes I have trouble seeing how background graphics are working in the code, so I want to actually get the background image to see, for sure, just what that image was because its sort of hard in CSS due to blending of background colors to graphics, etc..p  pAnyway, in a traditional HTML website you can rightclick the image and save it to your computer. Can you do this in CSS  I can get the .css style files theyll pop up in Notepad, etc.  but can I get the graphics p  pThe ID code usually says something like  p  precodebackgroundurlgraphicfilename.jpg norepeat left top codepre  p..but that doesnt tell me the directory that file is in.

But it   will only do a few dozen transactions   per second. Transaction speed is   limited by the rotational speed of   your disk drive. A transaction   normally requires two complete   rotations of the disk platter, which   on a 7200RPM disk drive limits you to   about 60 transactions per second.   Transaction speed is limited by disk   drive speed because by default   SQLite actually waits until the data   really is safely stored on the disk   surface before the transaction is   complete. That way, if you suddenly   lose power or if your OS crashes, your   data is still safe. For details, read   about atomic commit in SQLite..p      pBy default, each INSERT statement is   its own transaction. But if you   surround multiple INSERT statements   with BEGIN...COMMIT then all the   inserts are grouped into a single   transaction. The time needed to commit   the transaction is amortized over all   the enclosed insert statements and so   the time per insert statement is   greatly reduced.p      pAnother option is to run PRAGMA   synchronousOFF. This command will   cause SQLite to not wait on data to   reach the disk surface, which will   make write operations appear to be   much faster. But if you lose power in   the middle of a transaction, your   database file might go corrupt.p blockquote  padding a transaction codeBEGINcode, codeCOMMITcode boosted the performance for 300 insert from 45 sec to 1 sec.

Negative 29657 pI am looking for a simple way to reduce header coupling in a C project, which comes mostly due to overused class composition which of course requires complete type. For examplep  precode header A class A    B b  requires header B  codepre  pI have also considered interfaces and pimpl, but both imply some boilerplate code which I do not want to writesupport manually or is there a way to make this automatic.p  pSo I thought about replacing member with a pointer and a forward like codeclass B pBcode, but this requires handling of object creation and deletion. Ok, I could use smart pointers for deletion not codeautoptrcode though as it requires complete type at creation so say something like codesharedptrltclass Bgt pBcode, but how to be with the object creation nowp  pI could create the object in codeAcodes constructor, like codepB  new Bcode but this is, again, manual, and what is worse, there could be several constructors... So Im looking for a way to do this automatically, which would work as simple as changing codeB bcode to codeautoobjptrltclass Bgt pBcode in codeAcodes definition without having to bother with codepBcode instantiation.p  pIm pretty sure this is not a new idea, so maybe you could give me a reference to a common solution or a discussionp  pstrongUPDATEstrong To clarify, I am not trying to break the dependency between codeAcode and codeBcode, but I want to avoid inclusion of codeBcodes header when one includes codeAcodes one. In practice, codeBcode is used in implementation of codeAcode, so a typical solution would be to create an interface or pimpl for codeAcode but I am looking for something easier for the moment.p  pstrongUPDATE2strong I suddenly realized that a lazy pointer such as proposed a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions878166isthereclazypointerherea would do the trick too bad there is no standard implementation of this in say boost, when combined with virtual destructor to permit incomplete type. I still do not get why there is no standard solution and feel like reinventing the wheel...p  pstrongUPDATE3strong Suddenly, Sergey Tachenov came with a very simple solution the accepted answer, though it took me half an hour to understand why it really works... If you remove A constructor or define it inline in the header file, the magic wont work anymore compliation error. I guess that when you define an explicit noninline constructor, the construction of members even the implicit ones is done inside the same compilation unit A.cpp where the type codeBcode is complete. On the other hand, if your codeAcode constructor is inline, creation of the members must happen inside other compilation units and wont work as codeBcode is incomplete there. Well, this is logical, but now Im curious  is this behavior defined by the C standardp  pstrongUPDATE4strong Hopefully, the final update. Refer to the accepted answer and the comments for a discussion on the question above.p
Negative 29657 pI know that when you define a function in vim, you can use the coderangecode keyword so that users can sayp  precode5,5call MyFunction codepre  pAnd then your function gets afirstline and alastline.p  pWhat I want is something similar, but more like the traditional vi way of combining a command with a movement, so that d  deletes a space, dw deletes a word, d2w deletes two words, d2j deletes three lines, etc. Assuming my function gets mapped to some inputmode character sequence, is there any way to make it accept similar variablelength inputs, and then modify that textp  pJust to be a little more clear, suppose I want to define a function to wrap ltbgt tags around existing text. Well say that function is mapped to b. I want users to be able to say bw to bold one word, or bf. to bold everything to the end of the sentence, or whatever, with all the flexibility that vim provides to builtin commands.p

Negative 29657 pHowdy, Im working at figuring out how to best work within my own repo for custom code while integrating with a vendors library in this case Magento.  In my case, I will not need to push up patches to the vendor although that would be a great side benefit.p  pIve looked into git submodule and git subtree.  I dont think git submodule will work for what I need.  Magento has the following type of tree structurep  precodeapp   code      community       core      local    design      adminhtml      frontend         base         yourtheme  lib   Zend   Varien   yourlib  js   yourjs    varien   mage codepre  pUsing git submodule seems to work best in separate folders e.g.  is your app and vendormagento is the submodule.  However, with this degree of intertwining, a submodule doesnt seem like a good solution.  Am I wrong about thisp  pThat leaves me with git subtree.  But with git subtree, the same core assumption that the vendor branch is, as implied by the name, a subtree doesnt hold true.  Magento isnt a subtree, but the core library that my project fits within.  Is that correctp  pIf those two methods of git dont work, are there other ones I should know about that would do what Im trying to accomplishp  pThe final option Im reluctant to pursue is having a repo that I then just apply over the latest vendor changes pulled in from a tarball.  Im reluctant to pursue this as I feel that having the vendors log information pulled from a hrefhttpsgithub.commagentomirrormagentomirrorhttpsgithub.commagentomirrormagentomirrora would be greatly helpful in sorting through new updates and figuring out what changes have affected me.p  pAny thoughts or suggestions on how to pursue this further  Thanksp

I used wall time measurement, which should in theory mean that all threads would run for a same amount of time. p  pBut this wasnt true some threads actually those I was most interested in displayed total time about 2 times less than others. For example, profiling ran for 230 seconds, emmostem threads report 230 seconds spent in thread, but 5 threads only show 100110 seconds. These are not threadpool threads, and they were definitely created and started before profiling started.p  pWhat is going on herep  pstrongUpdatestrong Ill add more info that may or may not be relevant. The application in question it is a game server has about 2030 constantly running threads. Most threads follow simple pattern they check an incoming queue for work, and do work if there is some. The code for thread func looks something like thisp  precodewhiletrue     ifTryDequeueWork  if queue is not empty         DoWork          do whatever is was on top     else         mWaitHandle.WaitOneMaxTimeout  mWaitHandle gets signaled when work is added to queue       codepre  pThe threads that display weird times are like this, except they serve multiple queues, like thisp  precodewhiletrue     bool hasAnyWorkfalse     foreachvar queue in mQueues         ifqueue.TryDequeueWork             hasAnyWorktrue             DoWork                   ifhasAnyWork          mWaitHandle.WaitOneMaxTimeout        codepre  pThe weird threads dont do any IO except maybe logging. Other, nonweird threads, do logging too. Time spent waiting for a WaitHandle is reported in profiler actually, some of the nonweird threads spend almost all of their time waiting as they never have any work.p  pThe application was running on an 8core virtual machine VPS hosting. I dont know what physical processors are used there.p

Negative 29657 pI have a c windows app calling into a ccli library, which is calling into a managed library.  The managed library is calling OpenFileDialog.Show with a WPF window parent which is owned by the Win32 window.  I havent found a better way to do this, and all the resources Ive read here and searching google and social.msdn recommend doing what Im doing.p  pThe dialog opens just fine, but when I hit the cancel button, for instance, the app loses focus completely.  Im not sure why its happening, but I cant seem to make it stop.  Ive tried a number of different things to no avail.p  pIf I just launch the OpenFileDialog without creating a WPF Window, I dont see the problem. If I dont set the owner of the WPF Window, I dont see the problem.  If I call OpenFileDialog.Show and dont pass the parent, but still create the WPF Window and set its owner, I still see the problem.p  pI am able to hack it to set the parent app window to foreground after it loses focus, but I would like to not have to.p  pI have uploaded a small example solution for my scenario that illustrates the problemp  pa hrefhttpdl.dropbox.comu26054523MixedExample.zip relnofollowhttpdl.dropbox.comu26054523MixedExample.zipap  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Negative 29657 pI am using Lucene 3.0.3. In preparation to using SpanQuery and PhraseQuery, I would like to mark paragraph boundaries in my index in a way that will discourage these queries from matching across paragraph boundaries. I understand that I need to increment position by some suitably large value in the codePositionIncrementAttributecode when processing text to mark paragraph boundaries. Lets assume that in the source document, my paragraph boundaries are marked by codeltpgt...ltpgtcode pairs. p  pHow do I set up my token stream to detect the tags  Also, I dont actually want to index the tags themselves. For the purposes of indexing, I would rather increment the position of the next legitimate token, rather than emitting a token that corresponds to the tag, since I dont want it to affect search.p

Negative 29657 pSo the other day, I was looking through some old C books and noticed a way of creating a C class I had never seen before.  Everything I have seen up to that point had always used the include header.h and compiled the implementation files separately.  What I saw the author of this book do is actually put an include directive to the implementation at the end of the header file and omitting the .cpp file from the compilation.  Has anybody used this style p  pFor Example I have main.cpp employee.h employee.cppp  precodemain.cpp include ltiostreamgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltstringgt include employee.h void main some code    employee.h ifndef EMPLOYEEH define EMPLOYEEH class employee     public    public members    private    private members  endif  employee.cpp include employee.h include ltstringgt public member definitions codepre  pI would normaly compile this project like sop  precodeg main.cpp employee.cpp codepre  pBut in the authors example is like thisp  precodemain.cpp include ltiostreamgt include ltstdio.hgt include ltstringgt include employee.h void main some code    employee.h ifndef EMPLOYEEH define EMPLOYEEH class employee     public    public members    private    private members  include employee.cpp   lt the line of code that caught my attention endif  employee.cpp  include ltstringgt public member definitions codepre  pAnd the resulting code compiles asp  precodeg main.cpp codepre  pIs this merely a style preference or are there any real benefits in this  I would think it wouldnt scale very well, but I am not a super proficient C programmer either.p

Negative 29657 pIm new to source control.  Im working on a team right now, and were using Perforce the strongGUIstrong version P4V.  Im connected to my teams repository, and after I know I have something working, I commit new files or my changes to the repository. p  pThis is all good and dandy, but I dont want to commit things too often to their repository.  They run frequent builds using all these files, and I find its better to commit things to it when theyre completed and working correctly, rather than incrementally along the way.p  pMy problem I find that I often screw something up in a file and have no idea what I screwed up.  It would be fantastic if I could just revert to an earlier working version of said file.  However, with the way Im using my teams source control, this isnt possible.  Id like to set up my own local version of my teams source control that I can commit things to far more frequently but they wouldnt all actually see.  I want it to be identical, but my commits are only for my personal use and thus wouldnt mess up their build if they werent perfect.p  pemI basically want a clone of the repositoryem where I can check stuff in for my personal use before checking it in to their repository.p  pHow can I do this  I have to admit, Im finding using source control a little confusing.p

Negative 29657 pIve observed this issue for years now, not knowing where it came from. I am concerned that this bug is still observable in the new versions of Android, in 2011, and I hope you can finally help me to fully understand it, if not solve it.p  pLets consider the given real situation. Mister A is using a custom SMSMMS app from Sony on his Xperia Arc official 2.3.3. Mister B is using the android SMSMMS stack app on his Milestone Cyanogen 6.12, unofficial 2.2. Both of them use Android in French if that matters.p  pWhen A sends a sms to B containing special characters like , , B receives a message with  these characters replaced by a space. Characters like  are working fine though. When B sends the sms to A, everything works fine. When A sends this sms to himself, everything works fine.p  pConclusion  this is not the mobile providers fault since it works in one way and not the other. p  pSo, I guessed at first that something was wrong with As custom app. Replaced it with the apk from Bs phone. Everything remained the same. I decompiled the app and I didnt find where the encoding of the sms string was done. I concluded the bug is not coming from the app, but from the way Android encodes the strings... p  pI ran another test   I wrote an sms with only standard characters, something like 250 characters in 1.5 sms. Then, I append a  to the sms.  On As phone  the counter says it consumed 10 characters.  On Bs phone  the counter says the sms now takes 3 sms  the string size doubled p  pConclusion   On As phone, the default charset includes . On Bs phone, when  appears, the charset changes and each character needs then twice the original space.  Or am I missing something p  pQuestions  Why different version of Android arent using the same default charset  On Android, are these default charset depending on the rom, for example   Can we configurechange these charset somewhere in the menu or directly on a rooted phone  Is there another easy way to fix this p  pAny help, explanation or experience is welcome p

Negative 29657 pI have a search controller in UITableViewController. Everything is OK when Im scrolling through the records, but the problem appears when Im in search mode. The result set returned from search controller behaves very strange. If I start to scroll then the whole rows with cells and borders start to scroll normally but then the initial cell borders appears on top of the screen and stays fixed at the initial border positions. So Im experiencing double row cell borders that overlaps. Does anybody know what causes such behavior p  pUPDATE it looks like if the search result contains more rows like 9 then the scroll behaves normally. But if there are 3 or 4 rows then those weird fixed cell borders appear.p

Negative 29657 pI need to send an email on completion of a build in TFS 2010 which details the work items associated with checkins that have been compiled as part of this build. This works no problem via use of the codeassociatedChangesetscode variable available in the build workflow.p  pHowever, in a production situation, we will merge changes from our Development branch into a Release branch. At this point, the build considers there to have only been one change  which is the aforementioned merging of Development into Release. Obviously this is fairly useless as we need to find out which changes where made in the branch that was merged in, and the strongwork itemsstrong associated.p  pDoes anyone know how to accomplish this using the TFS 2010 API It seems to be fairly poorly documented from an API perspective.

Negative 29657 pIve looked at a lot of questions on SO and google regarding subclass mappings in nhibernate  fluentnhibernate and not managed to find anyone with the same problem as me. Ive followed the basic instructions from the fluentnhibernate wiki httpwiki.fluentnhibernate.orgFluentmappingSubclasses but this hasnt helped.p  pI have a base entity called Operation  which has a base table associated with it, I then have subtables UnpaidCheque, Refund etc  the primary key for each of these subtables is a foreignkey, the OperationId PK from the Operation table.p  pWhen I create a persistence specification and try to verify my mappings it is trying to save all the columns to the Operation table, rather than saving to the Operation table and then saving the specific columns of Unpaid Cheque to the UnpaidCheque table. p  pThe error isp  precodecould not insert [UnpaidCheque][SQL INSERT INTO Account.Operation PaymentId, Amount, UnpaidOn, UnpaidByUserId, OperationType VALUES , , , , U select SCOPEIDENTITY]   gt System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException  Invalid column name UnpaidOn.

Then we have to think how can we judge which one is better, using or not using shared memory. I think one approach is checking whether there is global memory access limitation memory bandwidth bottleneck or not. It means we can select not using shared memory if there is no global memory access limitation. Is it good approach pli lipPlus above question 2, I think if the data that my CUDA program should handle is huge, then we can think not using shared memory is better because it is hard to handle within the shared memory. Is it also good approachpli ol

Negative 29657 pI have a solution in Visual Studio 2012. It includes two projects for tests, one in F and one in C. I have installed NUnit and FsUnit as Nuget packages. After the installation, the references to these assemblies point to the codedllcodes found in the codepackagescode folder inside my solution. After I compile the solution, the references change in the F project and point to the NUnit installed in my codeCProgram Files x86code folder and the codebinDebugFsUnit.NUnit.dllcode in my F project. In the C project the references keep pointing to the packages folder.p  pThe project builds in Visual Studio and the tests run fine. When I build it in TeamCity it fails as it cannot find NUnit and FsUnit in the F project.p  pAny ideas why the reference change when I compilep  pMoreover, why the properties of a reference in an F project contain much less information compared to the ones in a C projectp

Negative 29657 pIn C, is there any value in using a codeconst void code for an argument type to a function over a codevoid code  Since a codevoid code is opaque, is there any risk of modification other than if the user does codereinterpretcastcode, in which case they could likewise do codeconstcastcode on a codeconst void code and thus does one really buy anything  I ask because I was using a utility template class for shared pointers which provided a specialization on codevoidcode to avoid codevoid ampcode issue but no specialization was provided for codeconst voidcode and thus I wonder whether this was just an oversight or should it never be neededp
Negative 29657 pFirst question is it seems like magic that one I run .run.sh, I can turn off the computer, turn it back on again and still it knows about localhost8080jmxconsole. I looked in the start up programs and I dont see any hint of it. How does it rememberp  pNever mind, the real question is I want the host to be my local LAN and not just localhost. I found I could do shutdown.sh and that would indeed shutdown the server such that localhost8080jmxconsole would no longer work. That is good, now the next step is to confine it to my LAN. I know I can use .run.sh b 0.0.0.0 but that opens it to the world. My computer is at 192.168.1.100 so I tried .run.sh b 192.168.1.0 which I would take to mean take addresses in the range 192.168.1.XXX. The server started but I cant get it to answer any calls and I couldnt get shutdown.sh to do anything.p  pI started .run.sh again and it hooked up to the localhost. I dont know if it still has a memory of my .run.sh b 192.168.1.0 or not. If so, Id like to get rid of it. In any case Id like to know what the correct command should be.p  pThanks, Ilanp

Negative 29657 pSo I have an app which needs to read a lot of small data e.g an app that processes lots of customer records.p  pNormally, for server systems that do this kind of stuff, you can use a database which handles a caching most recently used data b indexing them, and c storing them for efficient retrieval from the file system.p  pRight now, for my app, I just have a stdmaplt that maps data id into the data themselves which are pretty small like 120 bytes each, or something close to that. The data id themselves are just mapped into the file system directly.p  pHowever, this kind of system does not handle unloading of data if the memory starts to run out or efficient storage of the data granted, iOS uses flash storage, and so the OS should handle the caching, but yeah.p  pAre there libraries or something like that that can handle this kind of stuff Or would I have to build my own caching system from scratch Not too bothered with indexing, only a cachingunloading and c storing for efficient retrieval. Im feeling wary on storing thousands or potentially hundreds of thousands of files onto the file system.p

Negative 29657 pIn my RAD, often times when I launch it and go to my workspace, i see some projects have a red error cross sign. And usually the message is that certain libraries are missing etc. But by going to the build path of each project, I can see that the libraries are existing in the build path.  p  pThis issue I have been solving by removing the library that RAD is complaining about,building the project, adding the library back and building the project again.Then the error goes away. It seems that RAD somehow loses track of the libraries. The .classpath file however shows that the library exists even though RAD was complaining. p  pIs there a permanent fix to this issuep

Negative 29657 pLets say I have a set of items that I need to display in a tablelist. The set is highly mutable, because backgroundjobs and other users access the same data. p  pNow the resulting output has to contain links that trigger actions on the underlying data. These actions might remove an item from the set, but dont always do so.p  pSince the model of a ListView Im not quite sure about DataView right now is indexbased, its bound to fail in such situations. I get errors when I click a link that refers to the wrong object because the order or size of the underlying list has changed. p  pSo what I need are links that always refer to the natural ID of the object they are supposed to operate on. When a link gets rendered to the user, I want that rendered link to always refer to the same object, no matter what happens to the set that was used at render time.p  pThe easiest solution that comes to mind is using a stateless link only containing the action and the id, leading the user to another page. But this has the obvious disadvantage that I loose all the benefits the Componentsystem provides in the first place.p  pHow would you solve this problemp

Should f instead be read as a reference to something with an codeoperatorcode defined p  precodeinclude ltmapgt include ltiostreamgt  templatelttypename OutputT, typename InputTgt class memoizer  private     OutputT ampf InputT     stdmapltInputT,OutputTgt dat  public     memoizer OutputT ampf  InputT    ff        OutputT operator InputT t               if dat.countt0              dat[t]  ft         return dat[t]        int fib int n       if n lt 2  return 1     return fib n2   fib n1    int main      memoizerltint,intgt fibmemo fib      memoizerltint,intgt fibmemomemo fibmemo           stdcout ltlt fib 12  ltlt n     stdcout ltlt fibmemo 12  ltlt n     stdcout ltlt fibmemomemo 12  ltlt n  codepre  pI mean, dont get me wrong Im glad it works, it just seems kind of magical.

Negative 29657 pIf I install all packages using p  precodepython setup.py install prefix.local codepre  phow can I make Python read my packages from there and not from the system wide version I tried editing codePYTHONPATHcode to put code.locallibpython2.xsitepackagescode first, but it does not help.p  pI thought that code.localcode is guaranteed to be read first in Python 2.6 and later versions. Is this true Is something special required to make it true That would solve the issue. Right now it seems that codePYTHONPATHcode paths get incorporated into codesys.pathcode but are in the list after the systemwide codesitepackagescode directories, making the system wide version get used instead of the one in code.localcode.p  pUsing codepipcode is not an option unfortunately. p

Negative 29657 pIve recently experienced an error that may have taken down the whole web server. Im relatively new to web programming 2 years experience... kinda.

One handles strongloggingstrong. The other handles strongemailsstrong.p  pI had set up the logging class to send an email alert if there is an error log generated.

Negative 29657 pWhat is the best way to prevent MVC 4 overpostingp  pAccording to MS sources, the [Bind] attribute is supposed to be the easiest way to prevent overposting by preventing incoming form values from making it to the database.  With the latest version of MVC amp EF this does not seem to be working as expectedadvertised, unless Im missing something major.p  pFrom emWrox Professional ASP.NET MVC 4em Jon Galloways Chapter 7, the following class should prevent overpostingp  precode[BindExcludeIsAdmin] public class User      public int ID  get set      public string FirstName  get set      public bool IsAdmin  get set   codepre  pBut all the [Bind] attribute does is prevent the form submission values from binding to the model.  The model then has a blankdefault value, which is written back to the database.  In this case, it would ensure that IsAdmin  false EVERY TIME you call .SaveChanges using this model.  Any true values are overwritten.  Thats a HUGE security failure.p  pThe alternate syntax  placing [Bind] in the Edit controller action parameter  does the exact same thingp  precodepublic ActionResult Edit[BindExclude  IsAdmin] User user codepre  pAll true values are overwritten when .SaveChanges is called, contradicting K. Scott Allens blog post on the topic a hrefhttpodetocode.comblogsscottarchive20120311completeguidetomassassignmentinaspnetmvc.aspx relnofollowhttpodetocode.comblogsscottarchive20120311completeguidetomassassignmentinaspnetmvc.aspxap  pThe only alternative seems to be a flurry of dedicated ViewModels all wired up with Automapper.  While secure, that seems like a MASSIVE headache, especially asp  ul liYou may have different requirements for Create, Edit, Index, and Detail actions, requiring different ViewModelsli liYou may need to expose some readonly fields such as CreatedBy on the Edit action that cannot have the [ReadOnly] attribute on the property because they are updated by the Create actionli ul  pI know that somebody is going to respond by saying you should strongneverstrong bind data models to views, but that is the default template behavior and the way its shown in nearly all documentation.  And besides, MVC  EF was supposed to make life emeasierem, not emharderem, and an ocean of ModelView classes wired up with AutoMapper is not what I consider easier.p  pSo does anybody know how to make [Bind] function as advertisedp

However, now I need to animate two objects at once by using one of the views height. p  pFor example, I have MapView display in full screen. When user touch one of the onscreen button, Id like to scale MapView to make space for the incoming view. The incoming view then translate into the view to display its content.p  pI knew that this is possible on tablet because a hrefhttpsplay.google.comstoreappsdetailsidcom.trulia.android relnofollowTrulia for renta has pretty much the same effect that I wanted to go for. Is there some way to achieve this but with dynamic height insteadp
Negative 29657 pIm hoping this is a simple enough question.p  pI have FindBugs working in Eclipse. I also have it working in Maven. However, if I see a bug that is either a false positive, or too mild, or quite simply isnt going to be fixed, then I will ignore it in Eclipse. This then leads to a problem where Maven still reports the bug. This is not ideal. Technically speaking I could probably edit the Maven config to ignore certain bugs, but that seems inefficient. Also, there will be a team of people working on this project so I will need to eventually find a solution where the bug settings are stored in SVN, or on a network drive.p  pBut anyway, I think I have found the folder where the eclipse settings related to these bugs are stored codeltECLIPSEWORKSPACEgt.metadata.pluginsedu.umd.cs.findbugs.plugin.eclipsecodep  pIs it possible to point Maven at this same file during a build  Or actually, is it possible to extract this to a separate location, eg on the network, and then point both eclipse and maven at itp  pAny help appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 29657 pIs it possible to override a function andor template based on whether something is a constant expressionp  pBasically what Id like to do is build a string class that if handed a static string, or a constexpr variable pointing at one, it will simply use that pointer and wont later try to delete it.p  pOn the other hand, if the class is handed a buffer it needs to either copy it or adopt it, and then delete it in the destructor.p  pI think that the closest possible is to use a strong typedef and require the programmer to declare hisher static strings under that typedef.  I wonder though if those smarter than I can come up with something that doesnt require that.p

Negative 29657 pIn a nutshell, I have a gemfile that containsp  precodegroup assets do   gem mygem end codepre  p, a rake task codemyraketaskcode that depends on codeenvironmentcode, a Rails initializer that needs codemygemcode, and the following Capistrano snippetp  precodetask runmyraketask, roles gt db do   run cd releasepath ampamp bundle exec rake RAILSENVrailsenv myraketask end codepre  pAs things stand, invoking this Capistrano recipe causes the initializer to raise an error saying that a constant from codemygemcode is unavailable.  How can I either cause the rake task to pull in the codeassetscode group gems or add another group to the gemfile so that this initializer stops breaking  Note that of course I can just move codemygemcode outside the codeassetscode group, and everything works fine, but that seems like the cheap hack answer that Im sure can be avoided.p

Negative 29657 pAssuming I have a parent process that forks a child process, writes to the child, and then waits to read something from the child, can I implement this with one pipe  It would look something likep  precodeint main     pidt pid1     int pipefd[2]     char data[]some data     char rec[20]       ifpipepipefd  1         printfFailed to pipen         exit0           pid1  fork     ifpid1lt0          printfFork failedn          exit0     else ifpid10         closepipefd[1]         readpipefd[0],rec,sizeofrec         closepipefd[0]         do some work and then write back to pipe         writepipefd[1],data,sizeofdata     else         closepipefd[0]         writepipefd[1],data,sizeofdata         closepipefd[1]         ignoring using select for the moment.         readpipedfd[0],rec,sizeofrec      codepre  pWhen trying to learn more about this, the man pages state that pipes are unidirectional.  Does this mean that when you create a pipe to communicate between a parent and child, the process that writes to the pipe can no longer read from it, and the process that reads from the pipe can no longer write to it  Does this mean you need two pipes to allow back and forth communication Something like p  blockquote   pPipe1p      pPreadCp      pPltwriteCp      pPipe2p      pPwriteCp      pPltreadCp blockquote

Negative 29657 pIm wondering if there is a way to use datakeynames to access the primary keys of different tables if those primary key names are different in those tables.p  pFor example, I have a table called Table1 and Table2 where the primary keys are Table1ID and Table2ID respectively. p  pMy ultimate goal is to combine the contents of both tables into 1 gridview, and to generate a hyperlink for both every row. So my c looks something like thisp  precode protected void PageLoadobject sender, EventArgs e       SqlCommand command  new SqlCommandSELECT Table1ID, Title FROM Table1                                               UNION ALL SELECT Table2ID, Title FROM Table2, connection   GridView1.DataBind  codepre  pThen in my GridviewDatabound method, I go through and set the hyperlinks for each row individually. The problem is how do I access Table1ID and Table2ID In my .aspx code, can I set that to be a BoundField because the DataField wont be consistent I cant just do the following because then it neglects Table2ID rightp  precode  ltaspBoundField DataFieldTable1IDgt codepre  pMaybe I need to use a templateField or somethingp

But the thread is not reading the change of value of the boolean, it restarts to 00000 and, without me clicking the screen, keeps going to 00001  This doesnt happen with the first game, since the variables are the ones needed, it happens when i click new games, when the variables need to change.p  pHow do I need to allow the thread to read the change of the boolean bo1p

Negative 29657 pstrongWarning this question uses an analogy to RPG as an example.strongp  pLets say Im making this RPG Ive been dreaming of, using C. When the player enters battle, there is some kind of battlefield appearing, that holds references to every elements relevant to the battle, like the various opponents and items available on the battlefield.p  pNow all those elements have one but several roles for instance, an Ally which is a Fighter through direct inheritance is able to move on the battlefield, to issue commands or to be targeted by ennemies.p  pNow that mighty sword in the stone has also a few roles in battle. Obviously it cant move nor issue commands, but it can still be targeted, and it can hopefully be lifted or used.p  pAll these behaviors are represented by interfaces in my code, so that all objects with the same behaviors can be used regardless of the object that implements it.p  pCode examplep  precodepublic class Ally  Fighter, IMovable, IActor, ITarget       IMovable implementation     public void Move...  ...        IActor implementation     public bool HasInitiative  get  ...        public ICommand IssueCommand...  ...        ITarget implementation     public void OnTarget...  ...        other code ...   public class MightySword  ITarget, ILiftable, IUsable       ITarget implementation     public void OnTarget...  ...        ... other interface implementation       other code ...  codepre  pNow my question is the following How should my Battlefield class holds its references to all these objects I came up with two possible solutions, but at this point its not clear which one is the best, and whether better solutions are to be found.p  pstrongSolution Astrongp  pReference several time, access directly Using this solution, each object is referenced once per interface it implements, so my battlefield class would look like belowp  precodepublic class Battlefield  ...     IListltIMovablegt movables    IListltITargetgt targets    IListltIActorgt actors     ... and so on  codepre  pand the Battlefield.Update method could look this wayp  precodeUpdate...      Say every actor needs to target somebody else    it has nothing to do in the Update method,    but this is an example   foreach IActor actor in actors         if actor.HasInitiative             ITarget target  targets[actor.TargetIndex]       target.OnTargetactor.IssueCommand...          codepre  pThis solution allows us to have a direct access to the objects various behavior, but it introduces redundancy, as an Ally would have to be referenced into movables, targets and actors . This redundancy means a bigger memory footprint and will make adding and removing an object to the battlefield a lot more complicated each type should now from which collections it has to be addedremoved.p  pAlso, adding a new interface means adding a new collection to hold the item and manage the corresponding code.p  pstrongSolution Bstrongp  pReference once, filter access Using this solution, all objects derive from a single class or interface something akin to IBattleElement, and are stored in one single collection. When using the elements, they are filtered according to their typesp  precodeUpdate...      IListltIActorgt actors  elements.OfTypeltActorgt     foreach IActor actor in actors            ITarget target  elements.OfTypeltTargetgt[actor.TargetIndex]      target.OnTargetactor.IssueCommand...       codepre  pThere. No more redundancy, but I dislike using a typeof construct and I generally try to avoid it. Obviously this is worse regarding runtime performance.p  pI implemented solution A in my toy project, but there is nothing performance critical in this project. The answer should consider not only performance both memory wise and CPU wise, but also what offers the best design for the operations me or my designers might have to perform, such as adding new classes of BattleElement or new interfaces for new behaviors, adding and removing instances of objects from a Battlefield, and more generally use them in the game logic.p  pI apologize for the general silliness of my examples, I hope my English is good enough, and that my question carries at least a little bit of interest and doesnt indicate an overall silliness in the design itself.p

This is a rare occurrence, as most entries remain unique.strong Also, I have no errors in my logs.p  pCould it be that for some reason, multiple HTTP PUT requests are being executed concurrently and, since there is no synchronization, INSERT gets called multiple times I find it very unlikely, specially because the app only lets you press the button that performs this request once before it disappears.p  pI have tried using MySQL transactions but it didnt solve the problem.

Negative 29657 pAfter spending 16 hours and having sacrificed critters to various gods I must regretfully say that Im on the verge of mental meltdown. p  pI am writing an PhoneGap 2.8 application for Android in the future will port to iOS. As main frameworks I use jQuery with many plugins, Require, Underscore and Backbone.  On one fatal morning I got a task that header menu of my application must imitate the way facebook apps header does follow the scroll. p  pInitially I believed that adding positionfixed attribute to the header div would would be simple enough have I never been more wrong. As it turns out, positionfixed css attribute doesnt work properly in WebView and the issue has endured for years now.  This issue has been discussed in length in various forums and articles and various solutions have been proposed none are working in my case.p  pI have tried to set headers position to fixed when scrolling and to absolute when scrolling is done. Theoretically it works, but it is laggy.  Having tried that I looked into different plugins or frameworks that could help in the case.  iScroll  Forces a specified structure to html and severe lack of documentation threw me away from it.  jQueryMobile  Since it is a whole framework, integrating it to my project would mean changing alot of stuff. As I understand, it wont provide a persistent header.  p  pI have heard of Bartender and GloveBox but neither of them have documentation and they arent in constant development last commits are  year old . p  pUsing jsHybugger I inspected the header when it is in position fixed an I have noticed that Blue box that overlays a div being selected in inspector is staying where click area is for the header. So if I scroll, the header moves with viewport but hitarea stays in place. It got me wondering, if there is a way to force WebView to recalculate the click area p  pAll and any help is  very much appreciated. p

Having a list of classes isnt desirable, as these colours could change in the database, or new statuses could be added it would be preferable to call the colour value from the data.p  precodetext Status,  sortable true,  width100,  dataIndex Status,  renderer functionvalue, meta, record                     meta.attr  stylecolorrecord.data.StatusColour                     return value       codepre  pEDITp  precodeExt.onReadyfunction     Define the model     Ext.defineCaseModel,          extend Ext.data.Model,         proxy              type ajax,             reader json         ,         fields [             Id,             Project,             Status,             StatusColour,         ]            create the Data Store     var caseStore  Ext.createExt.data.Store,          model CaseModel,         autoLoad true,         proxy               load using HTTP             type ajax,             url lt siteurl gtCaseJSONAll,             reader                  type json,                 model CaseModel,                 root data                      ,         remoteSort true,         pageSize 20           Render grid     Ext.createExt.grid.Panel,          width 800,         store caseStore,         title Cases,         columns [             text ID, sortable true, width 25, dataIndex Id,             text Project, sortable true, width 100, dataIndex Project,             text Status, sortable true, width100, dataIndex Status              renderer goes here                          , renderer functionvalue, meta, record                  meta.style  backgroundcolor   record.getStatusColour                 return value                                       ,             text Details, xtype templatecolumn, width 50, tpl lta classlinkbtn hrefltphp echo siteurlgtCaseViewIdgtOpenltagt         ],         renderTo Ext.getCaseGrid,         dockedItems [             xtype pagingtoolbar,             dock bottom,             itemId PagingToolbar,             displayInfo true,             store caseStore         ],         features [             ftype grouping         ]        Sample JSON data      total17,     data     [         Id64,Projecttest case 1,StatusNew,StatusColourffffff,         Id49,Projectfgdfgdfgdfg,StatusNew,StatusColourffffff,         Id65,Projecttest case 2,StatusNew,StatusColourffffff,         Id50,Projectabc,StatusNew,StatusColourffffff,         Id51,Projectaaaa,StatusNew,StatusColourffffff,         Id67,Projecttest case 4,StatusNew,StatusColourffffff,         Id52,Projectfffffff,StatusNew,StatusColourffffff,         Id37,Projectghfdgh,StatusNew,StatusColourffffff,         Id53,Projectddddddddd,StatusNew,StatusColourffffff,         Id29,ProjectSuppress 0 value line items to SOP,StatusOpen,StatusColour6dce6d,         Id66,Projecttest case 3,StatusOpen,StatusColour6dce6d,         Id16,ProjectEgress locks,StatusPostponed,StatusColourcd7ddb,         Id63,ProjectPublic Comment2,StatusDuplicated,StatusColourbf6161,         Id30,ProjectNominal codes for Stock items,StatusDuplicated,StatusColourbf6161,         Id17,ProjectDetails missing,StatusClosed,StatusColour777777,         Id18,ProjectNonstandard finish not priced,StatusClosed,StatusColour777777,         Id19,ProjectPOA and VAT Rate,StatusClosed,StatusColour777777     ]  codepre

There is no other way in my situation p  pThe question is only about strongnegative side effectsstrong, not if its possiblep

Negative 29657 pThis is quite difficult to explain but the basic idea is that we have 2 ArrayLists. You compare List 1 to List 2 and if the entries match then you print Array List 1, and if not you just return the element from Array List 1.

Negative 29657 pMy understanding is that codeconstexprcode globals of class type are all but unusable becausep  ul lipSuch an object must be defined in every TU, because codeconstexprcode does not permit forward declaration of an object.pli lipDefault linkage as codestaticcode would cause naming the object ODRuse or not in an inline function to violate the ODR, because the respective codeinlinecode definitions would have different meaning.pli lipDeclaration as codeextern constexprcode with one definition per TU would violate the ODR rule if the object is ODRused, which occurs when a reference to it is taken.p  ul liA reference is taken for an implicit codethiscode parameter, even if its unused by a member function.li liObviously happens if you try to pass the object by reference.li liAlso happens if you try to pass the object by value, which implicitly uses a copy or move constructor, which by definition passes by reference.li liGCC and Clang both complain of ODR violations multiple definitions if an object is declared codeextern constexprcode even if not ODRused.li ulli ul  pIs this all correct Is there any way to have a codeconstexprcode global of class type without wrapping it in an codeinlinecode functionp

When the user is done editing and saves the file then closes out word,  Office throw a not responding message and forces them to close the office program, but when I check the document they tried to upload to the server the changes they made are present so my program is completing its process without error, I would assume. p  pThis only happens in Microsoft Office 2013. p  pBelow is the code I am usingp  precodePrivate Sub oWordDocumentBeforeCloseByVal Doc As Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Document, ByRef Cancel As Boolean Handles oWord.DocumentBeforeClose     Cancel  True     Try         oWord.ActiveDocument.Close     Catch ex As Exception         MsgBoxThere was an issue closing word document amp ex.ToString     End Try     oWord.Quit     Try         oWord.Application.Quit     Catch ex As Exception         MsgBoxThere was an issue closing word amp ex.ToString     End Try     Try         Dim filepath As String         Dim url As String  Server amp phpPD026U.php         Dim url As String  Server amp LibName amp PD026U.pgm         Dim url As String  http192.168.95.183file.php         filepath  strCommonAppData amp IO.Path.GetFileNameORGDoc          Dim request As HttpWebRequest  DirectCastHttpWebRequest.Createurl, HttpWebRequest          request.PreAuthenticate  True         request.AllowWriteStreamBuffering  True         request.KeepAlive  True         request.ProtocolVersion  HttpVersion.Version10          Dim boundary As String  System.Guid.NewGuid.ToString          request.Accept  texthtml , applicationxhtmlxml,          request.AutomaticDecompression  DecompressionMethods.GZip         request.ContentType  String.Formatmultipartformdata boundary0, boundary         request.Method  POST         request.Credentials  New System.Net.NetworkCredentialehavermale, ernie1           Build Contents for Post         Dim header As String  String.Format0, boundary         Dim footer As String  header amp           Dim contents As New System.Text.StringBuilder         Dim FileHead As New System.Text.StringBuilder           file         FileHead.AppendLineheader         FileHead.AppendLineString.FormatContentDisposition formdata nameupfile filename0, IO.Path.GetFileNamefilepath         FileHead.AppendLineContentType applicationmsword         FileHead.AppendLine          contents.AppendLinevbCrLf amp header         contents.AppendLineContentDisposition formdata nametask         contents.AppendLine         contents.AppendLineupload          contents.AppendLineheader         contents.AppendLineContentDisposition formdata nameINCOMP         contents.AppendLine         contents.AppendLineINCOMP          contents.AppendLineheader         contents.AppendLineContentDisposition formdata nameProgLib         contents.AppendLine         contents.AppendLineLibName          contents.AppendLineheader         contents.AppendLineContentDisposition formdata nameINCNUM         contents.AppendLine         contents.AppendLineINNUM          contents.AppendLineheader         contents.AppendLineContentDisposition formdata nameToPath         contents.AppendLine         contents.AppendLineToPath           Footer         contents.AppendLinefooter           This is sent to the Post         Dim bytes As Byte  System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytescontents.ToString         Dim FileBytes As Byte  System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytesFileHead.ToString          request.ContentLength  bytes.Length  FileHead.Length  New FileInfofilepath.Length          Using requestStream As Stream  request.GetRequestStream             requestStream.WriteFileBytes, 0, FileBytes.Length             Using fileStream As New IO.FileStreamfilepath, IO.FileMode.Open, IO.FileAccess.Read                  Dim buffer4096 As Byte                 Dim bytesRead As Int32  fileStream.Readbuffer, 0, buffer.Length                  Do While bytesRead gt 0                     requestStream.Writebuffer, 0, bytesRead                     bytesRead  fileStream.Readbuffer, 0, buffer.Length                 Loop                 fileStream.Close             End Using             requestStream.Writebytes, 0, bytes.Length             requestStream.Flush             requestStream.Close              Using response As WebResponse  request.GetResponse                 Using reader As New StreamReaderresponse.GetResponseStream                     Dim strResponseData As String  reader.ReadToEnd                     TextBox1.Text  strResponseData                 End Using             End Using         End Using     Catch ex As Exception         MsgBoxThere was an Error on File Upload Please Contact you Administrator for assistance   amp ex.ToString     End Try      Me.Close End Sub codepre  pI have tried changing how I close my word program, the order I close the document and word and tried to keep word open altogether and nothing I have tried works. p  pIs there an issue with Office 2013 and beforeclose or programmatically closing a documentp

Negative 29657 pI am running a program written in r language which is designed to compile many csv data files into one csv file and then generate an output file that contains the output of simple calculations on the few variables selected in the combined file. The later process is done by using the combined file as an input, selecting variables and specifying the kind of values that I need. Adding onto this explanation, data files are obtained on daily basis and these go through the r program to obtain some analysis, such as min, max, mean or sum of the data in selected time intervals. p  pMoving on to the problem that I have with this program, the program is usually able to generate the combined csv file without much problem, but when it comes to the part of producing an output file, the program sometimes generate the aggregation error message p  pstrongError in aggregate.date.frame mf[1L], mf[1L], FUN  FUN, ...  no rows to aggregatestrongp  pThis error message only appears for some combined data files, and is making me even more puzzled since the data in the combined csv files that are causing such problem do not show any difference with the combined files that do not cause this problem. However, currently I am still suspecting that there should be something wrong with the combined data csv files instead of the program since the program generally works fine for many analysis cases.p  pBasically, the program is using aggregate function to compute the output file.p  pI am quite new to using r, and the program that I am using consists of several stages, so I apologize if my explanation was rather unclear.  p  pAt least, I would like to know what are the possible causes for such aggregation error.

Negative 29657 pSo I know you can redirect in GAE from within a class that inherits from codewebapp2.RequestHanldercode using thisp  precodeclass Foowebapp2.RequestHandler     def getself         self.redirecthttpsgoogle.com codepre  pWhile this works, it would be great to be able to perform a redirect outside of a class.p  pFor example, say you have the following code that is a global function  i.e. it does not exist inside of a classp  precodedef fetchurlurl, methodurlfetch.GET, data     Send a HTTP request      result  urlfetch.fetchurlurl, methodmethod, payloaddata,                             headersAccessControlAllowOrigin       return result.content codepre  pIf you could redirect from the function, you could check the status code and redirect to an error page. E.g.p  precodeif result.statuscode  200     urllib2.urlopenerrorpage.html     return codepre  pUnfortunately, the above code does nothing in GAE and the following warning is generated.p  precodeWARNING  20140522 215824,364 urlfetchstub.py482] Stripped prohibited headers from URLFetch request [Host] codepre  pSo is there a way to perform a redirect outside of a classp
Negative 29657 pThis is what I would use to change the text if it were the same method but I want to change it from a different method.p  precodeIBActionStartTimeridsender       [sender setTitleStop forStateUIControlStateNormal]  IBActionResetAllDataidsender        [NEED THIS PIECE setTitleStart forStateUIControlStateNormal]  codepre

Negative 29657 pIt might seem obvious to some, but I was still wondering is there no way to make the compiler deduce the lambda return type without actually calling itp  pOf course you can codeauto retval  myLambdacode, however I want sth likep  precodeTMYLAMBDARETVAL retval ... retval  myLambda codepre  pWhy would I want that Simplep  precodetry      auto retval  myLambda catch exception e      ...    retval is undefined but I wonna have it  codepre
Negative 29657 pI am running Visual Studio 2010 on a Windows 7 VM and trying to build a fairly large solution.  When I try to do so, I get the errorp  precodeCannot register assembly CDevelopmentProjectNameSourcebinDebugAssemblyName.dll  access denied.  Please make sure youre running the application as administrator.  Access is denied.  Exception from HRESULT 0x80070005 EACCESSDENIED codepre  pI have taken the following stepsp  ol liConfirmed that I am in fact running Visual Studio 2010 as administrator.li liRestarted the VM.li liConfirmed that the assembly does exist exactly where Visual Studio is looking for it.li liConfirmed that administrator has full control over the relevant file.li liCleaned and rebuilt the project multiple times.li ol  pI have also found that building the project which creates AssemblyName.dll, manually registering it with RegAsm, and then building the project which requires AssemblyName.dll does not result in an error, but this is not a desirable workaround as it requires manual control.  Can anyone give me some advice on how to solve this problemp  pMany thanks.p

Obviously that removes sections in the code where I select data in the file. Yet I still receive different results when clicking. What might be causing thisp  pLastly, in addition to removing sections of code where codeSelectioncode is used, is there a way to help prevent the user from messing up the results of the macro in this wayp  pThanks again.p

Its not possible to alert the user that a update process is running because the scheduler tasks runs with a different user is not possible interact with the logged user. p  pHas anyone ever implemented anything similar Is this the best way to achieve my goalp

Negative 29657 pI am having strange behavior in regards to my ASP.Net MVC 5 applications that I am creating in regards to the unobtrusive clientside validation.p  pI have a created a complete new project, updated all Nuget Packages and created a very simple model with 3 fields that uses entity framework to connect to a sql database. The view was created automatically using the crud option when creating a view from a controller.p  pBasically what is happening is that the clientside validation is not working initially. All the fields in the model have been tagged with [Required] yet when I delete the value I receive no error message. The only error message I can trigger on the client side is with a date if I enter a letter. With an integer if I enter a letter I receive no client side validation.p  pOnce I hit the submit button however, I receive the error messages. The submit button is not posting all the way back to the server. I have put breakpoints in the aplication on the HTTPPost and it is not reaching this which tells me that the client side validation is working. p  pNow where it gets strange is after I have hit the submit button, the unobtrusive client side validation begins to work for every element. All fields now become required and error messages update as intended. What could be causing this that when the application initially loads it does not work p

I know that AJAX requests are detectable, but as for image loading, or IFrames not so much.p  pAnd Id like for this to be as dynamic as possible, ie. nothing added to the DOM structure whatsoever.p  pWell, thats it really, I thought that this would be an interesting thingy.

Negative 29657 pI am currently a python newbie and am using python to create some games. I have written a game House of Cards, and basically I am trying to use what I learn in OOP to do it.

Negative 29657 pI am working on a hybrid HTML5, Jquery Mobile application using phonegap. I am currently having an issue with a background image I set using CSS. I have a CSS class bPage that sets the background image and color and all that and it seems to work right. The issue is when you navigate to a page that requires scrolling. Because the image is set to be in the center it moves to the center of the page, which is great. The problem is that the page loads with the image in the spot of the previous page and then it jumps to the middle. I want to make it move the image before the rest of the page loads so that it doenst look like the background jumps last in the page loading. Both pages have the class bPage on them and it is working correctly, except for the jumping. I assume that there is a way to force this to load earlier or something but have not been able to find a way.p  pHere is my bPage CSS codep  precode.bPage     backgroundcolor 6c6d6f     backgroundimage url..imgBackgroundsBackground.jpg     backgroundrepeatnorepeat     backgroundattachmentscroll     backgroundpositioncenter  codepre  pThanks in advancep

Negative 29657 pI have been searching a lot in the past few days on listing fb likes in database. I have got help from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25837374listfacebooklikesunderneatheveryurl2584274225842742 titlehereherea too. Now i know how to get likes data from fb, read the results and update it in database.p  pWhen I get likes of 100 fb pages in a loop and if my end users are more, it puts a load on the database and the code runs very low. So I made two links. first link update.php  updates the data in database and second index.php shows the figures to user which runs fast. Now I want to add an auto update feature every one hour.p  pI know the logic but dont know how to convert it in syntax. I thought of making a update table with only one field which would be of datatime type. When the end user visits the link, it will first read the datetime value from the update table. If the difference between current time and last updated time from the table is more than one hour then run a function i already wrote one else run the remaining part of the code without running the function.p  pPlease advice if this logic is correct and help me with the syntax.p  pstrongEditing below after being put on holdstrongp  pI have a code in update.php that reads Likes from fb pages and puts it in my database fbdb in table fbtable under the field fblikes. This is working. I have another code in index.php that reads data from fbtable and shows the fblikes field values in front end. The end user will always see old Likes... that is, the data available in fbtable. The updated likes will be shown to user only if i run the update.php file. I am not merging both the files because if I have 100 pages, the page loads very slow and that is why I wanted a function that will check the last updated datetime in update table and if the difference of current time and last updated time is more than 1 hour then the update.php should run to ensure that the data is updated every 1 hour.p  precodeltphp include conn.php gt  lthtmlgt ltheadgt . . ltheadgt  ltbodygt read datetime from update table if current time  last updated time gt 1 hour run the function else do below task . . show data from database to end user . . ltbodygt  lthtmlgt codepre  pThank youp

Negative 29657 pRelated to a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26213330castfrominttounsignedshortafterapplyingbitwiseoperatorprevious questiona, I cant understand some rules of MISRA C 2004.p  pIn a hrefhttpwww.openstd.orgJTC1SC22WG14wwwdocsn1256.pdfISO C99 draft 2007a, in 6.5 section 4 p  blockquote   pSome operators the unary operator , and the binary operators ltlt, , amp, , and , collectively described as bitwise operators are required to have operands that have integer type. These operators yield values that depend on the internal representations of integers, and have implementationdefined and undefined aspects for signed types.p blockquote  pOk, using a signed integer with bitwise operators can produce undefined behaviour and makes no sense.p  pA good solution is to use explicit conversion to a wider unsigned integer type in order to bypass integral promotion, and then not use signed value with bitwise operators see associated answers of my previous question.p  pBut in MISRA C 2004, use of small unsigned integers with bitwise operators is possible rule 10.5 for example. Why, if integral promotion leads to use signed values with bitwise operators I think I dont understand some things.p

Negative 29657 pI am using a custom Left Menu Controller which can be opened by codeUIPanGestureRecognizercode when the codeUINavigationControllercode is only at its TopLevel. If some codeUIViewControllercode is pushed onto the stack, I want the codeinteractivePopGestureRecognizercode to work as expected and pop the VC when user swipes from lefttoright instead of the LeftMenu being opened. To achieve this, i subclassed the codeUINavigationControllercode as followsp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]     [self.interactivePopGestureRecognizer setDelegatenil]     [self.view addGestureRecognizer[self createPanGestureRecognizer]]    UIPanGestureRecognizer  createPanGestureRecognizer      SGFPanGestureRecognizer  panRecognizer  [[SGFPanGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTargetself actionselectorpanGestureRecognized]     return panRecognizer   voidpushViewControllerUIViewController viewController animatedBOOLanimated      ifself.viewControllers.count  1         ifself.view.gestureRecognizers ampamp self.view.gestureRecognizers.countgt0             for UIGestureRecognizer  recog in self.view.gestureRecognizers                              if[recog isKindOfClass[SGFPanGestureRecognizer class]]                      [self.view removeGestureRecognizerrecog]                     break                                   [super pushViewControllerviewController animatedanimated]   UIViewController popViewControllerAnimatedBOOLanimated      UIViewController  vc  [super popViewControllerAnimatedanimated]     ifself.viewControllers.count  1         [self.view addGestureRecognizer[self createPanGestureRecognizer]]     return vc  codepre  pEverything is working fine except one When i am at a detailViewController and I swipe from left, the VC starts the POP animation which goes along my finger. If I leave the gesture too quick, the detailViewController doesnt really gets popped and rolls back the popping animation. However, this action fires the codepopViewControllerAnimatedcode and my logic above becomes useless.p  pSUMMARY So is there a way to understand if the swipetoback gesture is released too early to really pop the codeUINavigationControllercodep

Negative 29657 pI have an issue with my include directories. I am creating a game project called Project2 within the same solution I have a project called Library which holds to its name.  I have created a few .h and .cpp files in my Project2 Asteroid h .cpp Serialiser h  .cpp GameManager h .cpp  Main h  cppp  pNow my problem is that some of the file will accept include directories and others will not. GameManager.h will only accept Serialiser.h but not Asteroid.h or any of the library files. Serialiser.h will only accept Project2 files and Asteroid.h will accept any file I include. standard windows files are accepted in all.  So here is what my tutor suggested and it has not worked so farp  pchecked that the library is linked to the project... changed the additional include directory in GameManager.hs properties from CfilefileLibrary to ..Library.... I have tried creating new projects and new files making sure that they are empty projects.... quintuple checked all my spellings.... adjusted the path of the Asteroid.h .cpp directories because they were in the Library mistake I guessp  pI have sent my project to my tutor on several occasions and he is able to compile my programme on his machine. So I think thats a lot of the basic stuff covered. Is it something that could be specific to my computer Im running 64 bit windows 7 laptopp  pThanks in advance,  Dan.p

I dont want to modify original data.p  pI have HTML in my DIV like thisbr codesome ltspangttextltspangt with ltbgthtmlltbgt tagscode where  is cursor positionp  pI tried to get range and extend it to the start of editable elementp  precodevar range  editor.getSelection.getRanges[ 0 ]     range.collapse true  range.setStartAt editor.editable, CKEDITOR.POSITIONAFTERSTART  codepre  pHere coderange.endOffsetcode is 3 the same as if I didnt extend range. But even if I sum up offsets of more elements, it wouldnt solve my problem, because it exclude HTML tags.p

Negative 29657 pI have a web application which consist of 1 web role and 1 worker role instance. The webrole basically aggregates some blobs on blob storage and the worker comes and sweeps the stored files and processes them. p  pThe problem is if I were to use 2 worker role instances, there may be some duplicate results due to the fact that the blobs only get removed on successful processing. In order to avoid this I decided to use Hangfire. p  pWhat I plan on doing is, when the web role gets the request, not only it will save the file to blob storage but also enqueue the processing task for that file. Then Hangfire worker threads will process it. p  pThis raises another question where should I deploy hangfire p  pIf I deploy hangfire onto web role instances, I will be able to access the UI since it has IIS, but I wont be able to isolate the resources used for background processing from the web role itself.

Negative 29657 pI write a lot of short utility python scripts that eventually make their way to people that are not computer literate and it ends up being quite challenging to get them to install python with the correct modules. I do not want to use something like py2exe because they just repackages the interpreter and can run slower speed is a major concern on some of these scripts. I know interpretive languages like Matlab offer the ability to translate their scripts into a binary executable for speed and portability and I am hopeful to do the same with python. Also please note that I am an expert Fortran 77 to 2008 programmer, but terrible at CC.p  pI have read that it is possible to compile python code with cython and the embed option. The problem I am having is I have found only references on how to do the final compilation with GCC and for unix or they refer to broken ...embedcython links. I do have a copy of visual studio 2008, but unsure how to set up a project in order to compile a static executable from cython code. This executable needs to be independent of the python interpreter and portable to someone without it installed. Typically these programs are written in Fortran, but I prefer python because of its easy of code, good OS and IO support, and flexibility compared to Fortran under certain circumstances.p  pI have been able to run Cython with embed and deduced the following compile optionsp  precodeset FILEXMyScript set INCCPython27include set INC2CPython27PC set PYLIBCPython27libs set PYLIB2CPython27PCbuild  cython FILEX.pyx  embed  CL.exe  c nologo Ox MT W3 GS DNDEBUG IINC IINC2  FoFILEX.obj TcFILEX.c  LINK.exe OUTFILEX.exe  nologo INCREMENTALNO LIBPATHPYLIB LIBPATHPYLIB2 FILEX.obj MANIFESTFILEFILEX.manifest codepre  pThe problem I have with this is Symantic Endpoint Protection immediately locks the file and quarantines it as a virus. If I remove the quarantine, then it immediately requarantines it. Normally I would not care, but this software will be used on government computers, which will have this same software, thus preventing my endusers from running the compiled code. This also leaves me with the inability to test if the code even works.p  pAny comments on how to compile a windows, stand alone, executablebinary based on python code would be greatly appreciated. Please note that a lot of the previous stackoverflow answers refer to links that are dead.p  pI do have visual studio 2008, so if there are suggestion on how to create a project for compiling the cython c code in a project is greatly appreciated I have other versions too, but I assume that is the only one that works for cython code. In that case I just would have the project solution point to the generated cfile and compile it within Visual Studio.

The form pages each have their own validations and the pages must be traversed in the order shown above. p  pWhen a user starts the process and successfully submits FORMPAGE1 and FORMPAGE2, and then stops on FORMPAGE3. Later they decide they want to complete the process so we still have the data from localStorage from the first 2 forms they completed.

I also dont want to pollute the model by adding flags to track these. p  pHow can I determine which page I should automatically send the user to so they can start working where they left off instead of having to click through the first 3 pagesp

Negative 29657 pSo IE strikes again. Im having a ridiculously hard time trying to figure out why IE is making a black screen show up on top of the video. I have a button on a web page that brings up a black div that fills the whole screen and inside the div is the video, along with a close button on the top right. The video works perfectly on all browsers, including IE9 itself. The real problem is that when I push the button that makes the div appear, it shows up all black, just like the divs background. However if I right click on the center where the video should appear and press the play option, it will begin to play and the video works fine. Yes, the video has a poster image and the controls appear on every browser, but on IE9, the controls and poster do not appear and the video screen is all black. The video even pops up when I go into the developer tools in IE9. I am simply baffled as to what kind of glitch is causing this. I even reset IEs internet options since I work at a firm and the browsers are slightly regulated here and nothing worked. Im starting to think IE9 has a bad rendering issue, but idk.... heres the codep  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodewindow.loadfunction    showvideo.clickfunction      presentation.cssdisplay,block      close.clickfunction      presentation.cssdisplay,none     codepre pre classsnippetcodecss langcss prettyprintoverridecode.title      background         urlhttpwww.sasllpcpa.comimagessasconsultingdoctor.png norepeat bottom right,         urlhttpwww.sasllpcpa.comimagessquaredmetal.png repeat     paddingtop25px     paddingbottom25px     bordertop3px solid 111       .title h1          fontsize4.32rem         color005287         fontfamilyOpen Sans, Droid Sans, sansserif         fontweigt700         margin0           .title h2          fontsize1.529rem         color111         margintop20px         fontstyleitalic           .title .row gt a          displayinlineblock         padding8px         backgroundFFF         borderradius5px         color005287         margintop100px         overflowhidden           .videobutton          displayinlineblock           img.videobutton          width32px         borderradius0         marginright10px         verticalalign middle           div.videobutton   video icon          fontfamilyDroid Sans, Arial, sansserif         fontsize0.8823rem         fontweight700         margintop2px           presentation   popup box for the video          positionfixed         background000         top0         left0         colorFFF         width100         height100         zindex1001         displaynone           close          colorFFF         fontfamilyDroid Sans, Arial, sansserif         fontweight700         fontsize1.3rem         backgroundCC0000          width40px         textalign center         positionabsolute         top0         right0           .videocontainer          positionrelative         top10         marginauto         width100         height100         maxheight480px         maxwidth640px             .title video          maxwidth100         height100              codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.11.0jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltsection classtitlegt         ltdiv classrowgt             lth1gtSAS Consulting ltbrgtServices, LLClth1gt             lth2gt...your dedicated healthcare trusted advisorslth2gt             lta idshowvideo hrefpresentationgt                     ltimg classvideobutton srchttpwww.sasllpcpa.comimagesiconsvideo.png altvideogt                     ltdiv classvideobuttongtAbout SAS Consultingltdivgt             ltagt         ltdivgt         ltdiv idpresentationgt             lta idclose hrefgtXltagt             ltdiv classvideocontainergt                 ltvideo idwebVideo posterhttpwww.sasllpcpa.comimagespresentationposter.png controlscontrolsgt                     ltsource srchttpwww.sasllpcpa.comvideosaboutsasconsultingservices.mp4gt                     ltsource srchttpwww.sasllpcpa.comvideosAboutSASConsultingServices.ogvgt                     Your web browser does not support HTML5 Video.                 ltvideogt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltsectiongtcodepre div div p  pyou can copy the code above on a jsfiddle, I already set it up using images and video for review [sorry if it looks a little messy, I was in a hurry].

Negative 29657 pTo my knowledge, in theory, if a class has a raw pointer member, then the default copy constructor will do a shallow copy of that pointer, such that when the original object is destroyed, the pointer member in the copy will have had the value to which it pointed deleted.  This seems to imply that outside of the case where we want to restrict copying for some reason, any class with a raw pointer member should define a copy constructor to do a deep copy on that pointer.p  pI am working with a respectable third party API, and Ive come across a class with a raw pointer member, but no defined copy constructor, which casts doubt on my understanding above. Am I missing somethingp  pstrongUPDATEstrong The third party informed me that this class is not meant to be copied, as the object represents a visual element.  They noted that they should have made a private copy constructor.p  pThanks to all for the input.p

Negative 29657 pI have spent a long time without making progress on what seems to be a simple problem. I need to allow the user to add up to three references to a form. Each reference will have a name and phone number two text inputs. I would like to do some simple validation on each one. I have created my codeReferenceTypecode and nested it into the main form with the following note, I created the PhoneNumber validator and added the codeNullcode just for testing p  precodebuildergtaddreferences, collection, array     type gt new ReferenceType,     byreference gt false,     allowadd gt true,     label gt false,     required gt false,     attr gt arrayclass gt reference,     options gt array         required gt false,         label gt false,     ,     cascadevalidation gt true,     constraints gt array       new Null,       new PhoneNumber,       codepre  h2ReferenceTypeh2  precodebuildergtaddname, text, array     label gt Reference,     required gt false,     cascadevalidation gt true,     attr gt array         placeholder gt Name       buildergtaddphone, text, array     label gt false,     required gt false,     attr gt array         placeholder gt Phone Number     ,     cascadevalidation gt true,     constraints gt array         new Lengtharraymax gt 14,         new PhoneNumber,     codepre  pAll of that is quite simple and straight forward. However, I have been unable to get the form to throw an error for any reason related to those references. I use strongPropelstrong for my ORM and have a lot of validation which works correctly on the main form. These references also display and function correctly except for validation. They are all mapped to strongonestrong column codereferencescode and I have tried Propels codetypearraycode as well as defining my own getter and setter which serializes the array of items. The codetypearraycode doesnt work at all with the collection, and serializing it seems to work ok. p  pI have searched SO and symfony.com docs for an answer but have found nothing that would actually cause either codenamecode or codephonecode to throw an error. I have tried adding validation to my codevalidation.ymlcode file without success 3 chars only for testing p  precodereferences      Valid       Collection         fields             name                  Length                     max 3                     maxMessage Please limit your references name to 3 characters or less. codepre  pIm probably missing something very obvious here, but I cant seem to grasp what.

Negative 29657 pI would like to use Fluent NHibernate automappings to create the mappings for my project, but then I would like override some of these mappings by another mechanism. That mechanism would be based on custom attributes on the model classes and some reflection login to inspect these attributes and perform the necessary overrides.p  pThe overrides are made by calling the codeOverrideltTgtActionltAutoMappingltTgtgt populateMapcode method in the AutoPersistenceModel class FluentNHibernate.Automapping.AutoPersistenceModel.p  pIm experimenting with just one attribute type at the moment. My idea is that if I get this to work, I will create more attributes and refine them. The one attribute I have at the moment is called MapIdAsAssignedAttribute and its supposed to perform the same mapping as thisp  precodemapping.Idx gt x.Id.GeneratedBy.Assigned codepre  pHowever, my approach is not working as I would expect. The code runs OK, and when the override method is called, Im able to verify by debugging that it is making the same changes in the inlineOverrides collection in AutoPersistenceModel class as are made when code.UseOverridesFromAssemblyOfltTgtcode is processed and it finds some classes implementing codeIAutoMappingOverrideltTgtcode. p  pThe problem is that when the configuration is built into an ISessionFactory object by calling the BuildSessionFactory method, the overrides I have made programmatically by calling the Override method are not included in the configuration. The configuration is as if the override calls had not been made at all.p  pSo, the overrides using the codeIAutoMappingOverrideltTgtcode classes work, but the overrides made by calling the codeOverrideltTgtActionltAutoMappingltTgtgt populateMapcode method dont work. And to be able to use the reflection stuff with custom attributes, I would need to get the Override method to work also.p  pAm I doing something wrong here, or is this behaviour the result of some logic in Fluent NHibernate Possibly a bug I believe this kind of programmatic overrides might be hugely useful for many other projects, toop  pHere is the code for the relevant class in my projectp  precodepublic class SessionFactoryCreator      private readonly string connectionStringName      public SessionFactoryCreatorstring connectionStringName  null              connectionStringName  connectionStringName           public virtual ISessionFactory CreateSessionFactoryltTgtstring connectionString  null              connectionString  connectionString  GetConnectionStringconnectionStringName         ISessionFactory sessionFactory  ConfigureltTgtconnectionString.BuildSessionFactory         return sessionFactory           public virtual FluentConfiguration ConfigureltTgtstring connectionString  null              connectionString  connectionString  GetConnectionStringconnectionStringName          AutoPersistenceModel autoMappings  CreateAutoMappingsltTgt          FluentConfiguration configuration  Fluently.Configure             .DatabaseGetPersistenceConfigurerconnectionString             .Mappingsm gt CreateFluentMappingsm             .Mappingsm gt m.AutoMappings.AddautoMappings             .ExposeConfigurationc gt                              c.SetPropertyEnvironment.TransactionStrategy, NHibernate.Transaction.AdoNetTransactionFactory                 c.SetPropertyshowsql, false                       return configuration           protected virtual IPersistenceConfigurer GetPersistenceConfigurerstring connectionString              IPersistenceConfigurer persistenceConfigurer  MsSqlConfiguration.MsSql2012.ConnectionStringconnectionString         return persistenceConfigurer           protected virtual FluentMappingsContainer CreateFluentMappingsMappingConfiguration mappingConfiguration              FluentMappingsContainer fluentMappingsContainer  mappingConfiguration.FluentMappings.AddFromAssemblyOfltSessionFactoryCreatorgt         return fluentMappingsContainer           protected virtual AutoPersistenceModel CreateAutoMappingsltTgt              AutoPersistenceModel autoPersistenceModel  AutoMap.AssemblyOfltTgtnew DefaultAutomappingConfiguration             .Conventions.Addnew ForeignKeyNameConvention             .Conventions.Addnew ReferenceNameConvention             .Conventions.Addnew ForeignKeyConstraintNameConvention             .Conventions.Addnew ManyToManyConvention             .Conventions.Addnew CascadeAllConvention             .UseOverridesFromAssemblyOfltTgt          foreach Type type in Assembly.GetAssemblytypeofT.GetTypes                      if type.GetCustomAttributestypeofMapIdAsAssignedAttribute, false.Length gt 0                              MapIdAsAssignedOverrideForTypetype, autoPersistenceModel                                return autoPersistenceModel           private void MapIdAsAssignedOverrideForTypeType type, AutoPersistenceModel autoPersistenceModel              MethodInfo method  GetType.GetMethodMapIdAsAssigned, BindingFlags.Instance  BindingFlags.NonPublic         MethodInfo genericMethodInfo  method.MakeGenericMethodtype         genericMethodInfo.Invokethis, new[]  autoPersistenceModel            private void MapIdAsAssignedltTgtAutoPersistenceModel autoPersistenceModel              autoPersistenceModel.OverrideltTgtmap gt map.Id.GeneratedBy.Assigned           protected virtual string GetConnectionStringstring connectionStringName              if string.IsNullOrEmptyconnectionStringName                      throw new ConfigurationErrorsExceptionConnection string name is not defined.

Negative 29657 pIs it possible to create a variable that is unique to that level of recursion so that whatever happens to it will remain that way, regardless of every other recursive step And can this be done in a way that I can retrieve the value in the variable in each recursive step after the recursion is finishedp  pLet me use an example to visualize the problem. Lets say Ive got a tree. I want to record the depth levels of every node, and organize it so that all the nodes at each depth level are bundled in the same array or list. So Ill need a different arraylist for each depth level.p  pIm traversing the tree recursively. At the beginning of each recursion, Im creating a new list. emIts the same line, so every recursion creates a list variable with the same name.em I am processing a node in depth X. I add this node to the list, then proceed recursively to a child node at depth X  1. I add this child node to a new list. So on and so forth until all the nodes in the tree belong to some list.p  pAfter the recursion is finished, I expect to have a number of lists equal to the height of the tree 1 list per depth, containing all the nodes in that depth, and a way to access all the nodes in all the lists.p  pIs this possiblep
Negative 29657 pIve been working on a bootstrap carousel that has one major issue remaining. p  pA pause feature is required and this is working correctly when used, but when focus moves from the pause button the carousel resets to default settings and begins cycling again.p  pIve tried two more methods of stopping this behavior that havent worked changing the interval rather than calling pause and making the pause button set a flag that will hit a codesetIntervalcode for the window that triggers the pause.p  pIs there a better method to halt the carousel cycling permanently when the pause button is pressedp  pThe page also uses the adobe mega menu, which I included the scripts for in case they are causing the issue. p  precodelthtmlgt   ltheadgt      ltlink hrefcssbootstrapcombined.min.css relstylesheetgt     ltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.11.2jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript srcjsjqueryaccessibleMegaMenu.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript srcjsbootstrap.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript srcjsbootstrapcarousel.jsgtltscriptgt    ltheadgt    ltbodygt     ltdiv classpagewrappergt         lt content starts here gt         ltdiv classcontentgt             ltcentergt                 ltdiv idmyCarousel classcarousel slide dataridecarouselgt                   lt Indicators gt                     ltol classcarouselindicatorsgt                         ltli datatargetmyCarousel dataslideto0 classactivegtltligt                         ltli datatargetmyCarousel dataslideto1gtltligt                         ltli datatargetmyCarousel dataslideto2gtltligt                         ltli datatargetmyCarousel dataslideto3gtltligt                     ltolgt                      lt Wrapper for slides gt                     ltdiv classcarouselinner rolelistboxgt                         ltdiv classitem activegt                             ltimg srchttpplacehold.it800x300 altEXCEL 2015gt                         ltdivgt                          ltdiv classitemgt                             ltimg srchttpplacehold.it700x300 altEEO Programsgt                         ltdivgt                          ltdiv classitemgt                             ltimg srchttpplacehold.it800x300 altPlace holdgt                         ltdivgt                          ltdiv classitemgt                             ltimg srchttpplacehold.it600x300 altFlowergt                         ltdivgt                     ltdivgt                      lt Left and right controls gt                     lta classleft carouselcontrol hrefmyCarousel rolebutton dataslideprevgt                         ltspan classglyphicon glyphiconchevronleftgtltspangt                     ltagt                     lta classright carouselcontrol hrefmyCarousel rolebutton dataslidenextgt                         ltspan classglyphicon glyphiconchevronrightgtltspangt                     ltagt                      lt Play and Pause gt                     ltdiv idcarouselButtonsgt                         ltinput typebutton classbtn startslide valuePlay idplayButtongt                         ltinput typebutton classbtn pauseslide valuePause idpauseButtongt                     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt             ltcentergt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt      lt Nav menu scripts gt     ltscriptgt         navfirst.accessibleMegaMenu              prefix for generated unique id attributes, which are required                 to indicate ariaowns, ariacontrols and arialabelledby              uuidPrefix accessiblemegamenu,               css class used to define the megamenu styling              menuClass navmenu,               css class for a toplevel navigation item in the megamenu              topNavItemClass navitem,               css class for a megamenu panel              panelClass subnav,               css class for a group of items within a megamenu panel              panelGroupClass subnavgroup,               css class for the hover state              hoverClass hover,               css class for the focus state              focusClass focus,               css class for the open state              openClass open              ltscriptgt     lt carousel scripts gt     ltscriptgt         document.readyfunction              myCarousel.carousel                 interval 2000,                 pause false                                        playButton.clickClickOnPlayButton          function ClickOnPlayButton             myCarousel.carouselcycle                       pauseButton.clickClickOnPauseButton          function ClickOnPauseButton             myCarousel.carouselpause                  ltscriptgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 29657 pWe have a problem in our company with an application and would like to advise us an optimal solution, the point is that we have an application for tablets made with Flex mobile, our application can open modules in execution time downloading it from a server, these modules are opened perfectly with AIR or Android but in IOS is not possible, thats not working. Some solutions for us to have the extra functionality that provide these modules have occurred, are as follows 1. Create a library for each extra functionality of each client and import all of them in the main application project. 2. Create a unique library with the functionality of all clients and then, import it in the main application project. 3. Create as many native extensions ANE and functionalities as are required by our different customer and import them into our application. I would like to know which solution is optimal because in the future we can get 100 customers and maybe too much functionality may slow down the application. Thank you very much.p

Negative 29657 pMy iOS app provides AVSpeechSynthesizer support in multiple languages not just the devices current language.

[AVSpeechSynthesisVoice voiceWithLanguage] requires the full languagelocale string, so passing in es gets you nil even though two Spanish voices are available by default.

Negative 29657 pHere is what I am trying to do, I have a sheet that has a list of names with no duplicates that varies in length. I would like to have either with a formula or vba sub, to have the next row copy the original list of names and offset it my one, so that the top name on the original is now the last name of the second list. I need to have at the end 10 list where none of the same names are in the same row.  p  pHere is a sample of what Id like it to look like.p  precodeColumnB   ColumnC   ColumnD   ColumnE Name1     Name2     Name3     Name4 Name2     Name3     Name4     Name1 Name3     Name4     Name1     Name2 Name4     Name1     Name2     Name3 codepre  pLike a game of Sudoku, none of the names in each row or column can have a duplicate.p  pI am not sure how to best achieve this since as mentioned above the length of the list is a variable. Ideally Id like to create the first list, then have the other 9 list to auto populate. Any suggestionsp  pEDIT Paul Drye, I get the following results with your formulap  precodeColumnB   ColumnC   ColumnD   ColumnE Name1     Name2     Name3     Name4 Name2     Name3     Name4     Name1 Name3     Name4     Name1     Name1 Name4     Name1     Name1     Name1 codepre  pAs you can see, the last two columns start showing an issue.p

Negative 29657 pI am learning laravel using Laravel Code bright. In the Form Security section of this book, it talks about how laravel generates secret hidden code to prevent CSRF  Cross Site Request Forgery when using the codeFormOpencode method to generate form inputs. p  pI tried an example to access the route that will process the form using an external form. First i did it without the strongbeforecsrf filterstrong attached to the route and i got the answer i was expecting, that is the external form was able to access the route. p  pFor the second test, i added the strongbeforecsrf filterstrong to the route. When i clicked the submit button of the external form, the page kept on loading for a long time and it gave up without showing any results,the page was blank. It means that the strongbeforecsrf filterstrong prevented this external form from accessing the route.p  pFor my third test, i copied the hiddentoken of the original form by viewing the browsers source code page and added it to the external form and tried it again and by clicking the submit button this external form gave me the same results as the first test, that is it showed the results meaning that it was able to access the route through the hidden token i added from the original form. p  pMy understanding is that if you add a hiddentoken to your forms to prevent CSRF and the attacker views the browsers source page and copied the hiddentoken and adds it to his form, he can still target your routes, since the hiddentoken will always be visible in the browsers view source page.p  pMy question is, is there a better way of preventing CSRF even if the attacker copies the hiddentoken and adds to his forms.p  pSomeone can help me understand what is going onp  pstrongThe external form am using is outside the root folder of laravel. I also copy the value of the action attribute of the original form in order to target the route of the original form. I copy it from the browsers view source pagestrong.p

However, for this particular project, I dont need to solve that and I feel that if I can solve this, the answer will be there for the other sites.p  pBy the way, this .htaccess file fails in my development environment no rewrites to bonus.php, though bonus.php is available directly through the URL.p  pThe whole concept of URL rewriting and regular expressions is foreign to me and reading through google and similar questions on stackoverflow is not helping. Ive been researching this problem for several months and I really appreciate any help.p

Negative 29657 pSo I have a matrix named allsds sized 5x5x54 where the 5x5 matrix is symmetric around the diagonal and the 54 represents the number of subjects. The number 5 represents a variable so the 5x5 part is basically a symmetric matrix of each variable correlated with the other there are 10 comparisons total.

I have been using a nested loop for value assignation and this was as far as I got.p  precodefor qq  1nSub     for ww  1numcomparisons         subsdsqq,ww  allsdssomething with variable comps,qq      end end codepre  pClearly I have no idea how to index into a matrix using another matrix...plus its in a loop so Im doubly confused.

So how do I access an option I set in the main manager in a subclassp  pThe documentation sort of has an example of this, but its in the same module, not a subclassed one.  I could pass the option into the factory function, and then set an appwide default, but that seems less than optimal as well, since I most of the time dont need to set it.  Do I need to create a CLI submanager, possiblyp

Negative 29657 pThis is what Im trying to do. I have 3 text boxes, a submit button and image on the screen. I want the image to go away if any of the text boxes are touched to input data for the login credentials.

Negative 29657 pIm suddenly getting the Bad Request 400 error when using the Azure Storage Emulator when trying to CreateIfNotExists. The Response on the Inner Exception says The value for one of the HTTP headers is not in the correct format. All the tables exist, the data is in the tables, everything was working up until an update to my NuGet packages. Looking around SO it seems like a common cause is an update to Azure Storage Client Library now at 5.0.0 that creates a mismatch. I updated the Azure SDK to 2.6 since I have VS2012. This brings the Storage Emulator up to 4.0.0.0, but still no luck...same error. This is kind of a bad thing that suddenly an update to a package of a package of a package causes the whole thing to break and completely kills my rather large project. Any ideas p

Negative 29657 pI was upgrading some VB6 code to VB.NET recently. One odd issue that came up is a difference in the codeshortcode data types.p  pThe original VB6 code has the following linep  precodefoobarampH8589 codepre  pwhere codefoobarcode is a function that accepts one codeshortcode argument. The above code worked fine in VB6. The purpose is to pass two bytes to this function and codeshortcode seemed to be a fitting data type, as it represents 2 bytes.p  pUpon upgrading, the code suddenly returns the error codeConstant value not representable in type Short.code So I read about this data type in a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary7tb7bdw6.aspx relnofollowMSDN, where it saysap  blockquote   pHolds signed 16bit 2byte integers that range in value from 32,768 through 32,767.p blockquote  pSo lets convert code0x8589code to DEC. Turns up as code31,351code which is well within the boundary set by the type. Now, the odd thing is When I call the function using the DEC value codefoobar31351code  it works p  pSo you might ask why I wont just use the DEC value. Well, using HEX has the advantage that everyone looking at the code immediately knows what bytes are passed, which is important in this case.p  pSo Why cant I use the HEX representation Is this difference documented somewhere Is there a way I could use the HEX code without changing the function eg. to accept two codeBytecode argumentsp

Negative 29657 pI am building a quadcopter and i am using the pixhawk autopilot system with the px4flow sensor attached for optical flow data. The px4flow is a high speed smart camera arm processor with integrated gyro and height sensor, and it outputs linear velocities from the internal optical flow algorithm.p  pNow, i would like to improve on my position and velocity estimates by using an extended kalman filter to fuse the IMU and optical flow data. I have already derived the state model function and the state transition matrix for the prediction step.p  pBy problem lies within deriving a measurement modelfunction for the optical flow velocities, to be used in the update phase of the extended kalman filter. I believe i have to derive it from the optical flow algorithm some how, but that is as far as i have gotten.p  pedit Here is an article describing the px4flow unit and how it calculates the velocities. forgot to add the link, now its therep  pa hrefhttpspixhawk.orgmediamodulespx4flowpaper.pdf relnofollowhttpspixhawk.orgmediamodulespx4flowpaper.pdfap
Negative 29657 pIm needing some explanation for an assignement. p  pIm modeling a ontology for restaurants. The classes relevant to this question are codedishescode and codeRestaurantcode. p  pThe class codedishescode contain subclasses with the sort of dishes they serve. So for example codeclassdishes has subclassitaliancode. To the subclass codeitaliancode Ive added instances like codespaghetticode. p  pThe class restaurant contains mostly subclasses with necessary and sufficient restrictions to describe the type of restaurants based on the dishes they serve. But before a restaurant can get categorised Ive got create instances with named restaurants. Take for example instancepizzaFreddi which is linked to the instance pizza through a property hasDish. Because the instance Pizza belongs to italian the restriction on one of the defined subclasses of restaurant with ItalianDishes infers this instance. This one works, Ive used a some restriction. But what I want to do is also create a defined subclass that infers instancesnamedRestaurants that have for example more than one location. The instance codePizzaFreddicode for example is linked with a property isLocatedIn to the city codeAmsterdamcode and codeDen Haagcode. Ive made a restriction that says isLocatedIn min 2 City. But this does not seem to infer the instance codePizzaFreddicode. Whats going wrongp  pIve added screenshots for explanation. p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com8sYNV.png relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.com8sYNV.pnga a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comz8rT6.png relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comz8rT6.pngap
