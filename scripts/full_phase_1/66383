Positive 66383 pWe are trying to automate a few things in CRM and I have an idea about how to go about it while still allowing customizations from the Process section in CRM Settings.p  pThe problem We receive a lot of Emails from an account that are added to a Queue. This queue fills up faster than we can clear it. Most of these Emails have a standard format and the user only has to read a few lines of the the Email body to figure out what to do. Theres a total of 6 different workflows that the user would do. These havent been implemented.p  pReading the documentation of CRM, I figured that I would need a custom Plugin that would parse the Email body, and trigger a workflow in CRM according to the values in the Email. I also need some of the values that the Email contains to be passed to the workflow. I already have the Plugin setup to do this.  p  pThe problem I run into is creating a process which takes in custom parameters passed over by the Plugin I created. I need to access these values in the frontend one of the Processes in CRM Settings. Is this possible If not, is there another way to achieve thisp

Positive 66383 pI call the same custom CodeActivity a number of times in a workflow with different input parameters, and then follow each call with a Check Condition step against the output parameters.p  pThe problem is there is nothing in the UI to distinguish between the calls.

Positive 66383 pWe are currently using CRM 2015 ONLINE and we have a requirement to find and delete unused fields from CRM organization. Also, we feel there are certain performance gains to be had by removing unused fields  especially Lookup and PicklistOption Settype fields. Since, these kinds of fields force CRM to get information from other database tables every time they are referenced, so its wasted effort to try to fetch that data when you know there never will be anything to fetch.p  pDo you have any way to figure out, which columns are null  OR Which columns has count 0  And does not contain any value in Table OR Im looking for a scriptway to do in crm ONLINE that will do a count for every column in a table including the number of null valuesp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comzyGKK.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzyGKK.png altExpected resultsap
Positive 66383 pI am attempting to eliminate the issue of Security Roles being dropped when changing a Users Business Unit in CRM 2011.  I have taken a few approaches with varying degrees of success, but none provide a seamless solution. So far a combination of plugins seems to be the best way.   p  pThe challenge is this The Security Roles are dropped after the prevalidation stage, but before the preoperation stage.  I am able to capture the users security roles in the original Business Unit when I register my plugin on the prevalidation stage if I execute an update other than changing the Business Unit, but the prevalidation plugin does not get triggered when running a Change Business Unit Update the first stage that occurs is preoperation.  I need to execute the prevalidation plugin when updating the users Business Unit.  Once I get the name of the security role, I can store it in the PluginExecutionContext shared variables, then in my poststage event plugin, I can query for the new security role with the correct name that is associated with my new Business Unit that part of the code is working.  p  pHas anyone either figured out how to p  pa transfer a users security roles from the original BU to a new one using plugins or notp  pOR p  pb trigger a plugin registered on the prevalidation stage for a Change Users Business Unit actionp
Positive 66383 pTrying to understand the expected behavior of CRM Reports w Report Server.p  pWe have CRM 2011, UR 18.  We are an ISV developing a Managed Solution to sell to our customers.  The Managed Solution contains several reports RDLs.  Want to understand how Updating works.p  p1 Import our Solution Unmanaged into a development Organization.  Solution contains Reports RDLs.p  p2 Surf to the Report Server associated with this CRM installation.p  p3 Click on the Report name in the list, select Edit in Report Builder from the drop down.p  p4 Edit the report.  Save it.p  p5 View the report in CRM.  Viola  we see our changes.p  pLater p  p6 Reimport another later version of the unmanaged Solution into CRM.  This copy of the Solution ZIP does emnotem contain the RDL edits we made via Report Builder on our Report Server.p  p7 Surf into CRM, Reports.  View the report we previously edited.p  pOur edits remain in the report that we do see  not what we expected.  We had thought that the reimport of the Solution ZIP would overwrite our edits to the RDL.  The behavior is as if the Report Server edits triumphed over the Solution contents.  Is this because we edited in Report Server directly via Report Builder p  pThanks in advance.p  pRegards, Howard Hoffmanp
Positive 66383 pI have added 3 buttons to the toolbar in order to process records from an existing CRM form Process Selected Records, Process All Records on Page, Process All Records from All Pages.p  pDealing with Selected records and All records on Page is fairly simple as the records can be accessed with settings in the RibbonDiffXml CommandDefinitionp  precode    CrmParameter ValueSelectedControlAllItemReferences     CrmParameter ValueSelectedControlSelectedItemReferences  codepre  pIm looking for a way, with javascript, to access all records from all pages of the forms grid when the user presses the toolbar button that I have added.

Positive 66383 pHi peeps on stackoverflow,p  pProduct CRM2011, should be latest rollupp  pIm currently trying to get the following to Work   A custom CRM form has been made. This form contain the Notes tab. I would like to dynamically expand this IF and only IF the Notes tab contains notes data. Im trying to do this through JavaScript loaded into Form Libraries. I can easily expand the notes field but Im having serious trouble determining if the Notes tab contains notes data.p  pI can understand that accessing the notes data through the DOM is not a good idea so Ive tried through XRM. Looked through a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarygg334351vcrm.5.aspx relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarygg334351vcrm.5.aspxa to see my options. But I cant seem to get to one where I can access notes and base the expansion of the notes field on if there is data or not in notes.p  pIs this possible Im looking forward to hear from you and thank you very much.p

Positive 66383 pI am having an issue with a crm 2011 custom workflow activity I have created. The workflow activity is part of a workflow that cancels and renews contracts.

Other activities in the same assembly still run fine so it has to be an issue with my activity. Has anyone seen this before Thanks in advance.p  pEdit p  pSo the issue sees to be related to my desire to reuse code Like any good developer would do. What I had done was created a service class to handle the cancelling and renewal of contracts so that I could call the same code from different parts of the workflow activity. Now it seems that CRM did not like this very much. I tried moving the methods out of the service class and into some private methods inside the workflow activity class but I was getting the same errors. Eventually I decided to see what would happen if I placed every line of code inside the actual Execute method of the workflow activity and viola No more errors. This seems a little bit strange to me because from where Im sitting instantiating and calling other classes should work fine in the same assembly as long as the classes are instantiated from within the execute method and are not globally defined. Any thoughts on why that might be Thanks again for all your help so far.p

Negative 66383 pI could use some help trying to track down an intermittent error that Ive been having with our ASP.Net project for quite some time.p  pIntermittently when building the solution, the build will fail with the error  Build web Object reference not set to an instance of an object. The error has no associated file, line, column or project information. The weird thing about the error is that it will go away on successive rebuilds and doesnt seem to result in any runtime errors that weve come across once the build is successful. Sometimes the error will pop only once, sometimes 34 times, but eventually the build will finish successfully and then seems to build just fine each time after. I havent been able to nail down a pattern as to why and when the error will happen, and since it always eventually builds it hasnt been a critical problem for us. Just an annoyance. But one that I want gone for obvious reasons.p  pI guess I should add that this is an application that was originally developed in ASP.net 1.1 and converted to 2.0 and I inherited it somewhere down the line after that, so I dont know when the problem originally surfaced. As far as everyone here is concerned, its always been there.p  pObviously Im not expecting someone to pick out the cause of my problem as that would require them to look at our entire solution to pick out potential problems. Just hoping someone can give me a couple fresh ideas as to how to go about tracking down the actual source of the error in code. It has to be coming from somewhere, right How would you go about finding out wherep

For example, java 5 brought generics and annotations to the language, features that can definitely boost your productivity.p  pHowever, when I look back at close to a decade working on java platform, I find that the versioning related problems are the biggest culprit of unproductive and needlessly spent effort. Hours and hours of looking for the correct version of the jar, trying to reconcile some versioning conflict, upgrading dependent libraries etc. When I started working in java, things were not that difficult, youd have a few 3rd party libraries and thats it. Today, your typical web app might easily use Spring Framework, Hibernate, Struts, you name it. All of these carry a number of dependant 3rd party libraries. Today, my ear archives will typically include some 40 or more 3rd party libraries. A real jar hellp  pWith annotations, I dont have to manage config files for Hibernate for example. A nice feature, but I havent seen that many problems arising from the fact I keep my descriptors in separate file. With generics, I am spared from writing cast statements, but in my whole programming carrier I cant remember a single bug that could have been prevented by using typesafe container. Wouldnt solution to versioning problems have been much more valuablep  pAll these problems have resulted in number of tools like a hrefhttpmaven.apache.org relnofollowMavena, a hrefhttpant.apache.orgivy relnofollowivya, a hrefhttponejar.sourceforge.net relnofollowOne Jara, a hrefhttpcode.google.compjarjar relnofollowJar Jar Linksa not kidding, even appropriately named a hrefhttpincubator.apache.orgdepotversionjarhell.html relnofollowJar Hella etc. Even if you use some of these tools, you are far from being immune to the problem. I use Maven 2 and it has been a great help. Still, it is a world to itself. Novice programmer can take a while to learn it. Moving your legacy projects to Maven structure is also a pain.p  pIt seems that in .Net they have learned the lesson with dll hell and management of .Net assemblies is much simpler. p  pThere seems to be plans to solve this problem for java platform and alternatives like OSGI. I think that some basic and platform enforced versioning mechanism is badly neededp
Negative 66383 pIs there a cost associated with overloading methods in .Netp  pSo if I have 3 methods likep  precodeCalculate int Calculate float Calculate double codepre  pand these methods are called at runtime dynamically based on whats passed to the Calculate method, what would be the cost of this overload resolutionp  pAlternatively I could have a single Calculate and make the difference in the method body, but I thought that would require the method to evaluate the type every time its called.p  pAre there better waysdesigns to solves this with maybe no overhead Or better yet, whats the best practice to handle cases like these I want to have the same classmethod name, but different behaviour.p  pEDIT Thanks all. Jusdt one thing if its any different. I was wondering say you have a DLL for these methods and a program written in C that allows the user to add these methods as UI items without specifying the type. So the user adds UI item Calculate 5, and then Calculate 12.5, etc, and the C app executes this, would  there still be no overheadp

Negative 66383 pSomebody tasked with creating a Core set of libraries created a set of static classes providing all sorts of utilities from logging, auditing and common database access methods.p  pI personally think this stinks because we now have a Core set of libraries that are hard to test because I cant mock  stub these classes or do any injection into their constructors.p  pI suppose I can use TypeMock to stub these out but Id rather do it for free.p  pWhat do you thinkp  pEditp  pIf you dont think theyre hard to test could you give an example of how you would test them.

Negative 66383 pI am using a TreeView with an ImageList. As the TreeView is filled with items, each item will have an icon associated with it. Many of these icons could be identical, but currently, I am not adding any code to track duplicates, I simply add each icon to the ImageList and then track the icon associated with each TreeNode.p  pMy question is about how .Net handles these resources. For example, does the runtime realize that some of the icons are exactly identical and thus only load the same icon once for all duplicates If not, could I run into a resource issue if this is done tens of thousands of times this wont be typical, but it could happenp

Negative 66383 pI have a pet project where I build a texttoHTML translator. I keep the content and the converted output in a directory tree, mirroring the structure via the filesystem hierachy. Chapters go into directories and subchapters go into subdirectories. I get the chapter headings from the directory and file names. I want to keep all data in files, no database or so.p  pKind of a keepitsimple approach, no need to deal with metadata.p  pAll works well, except for the sort order of the directories and files to be included. I need sort of an arbitrary key for sorting directories and files in my application. That would determine the order the content goes into the output.p  pI have two solutions, both not really goodp  p1 Prepend directories and files with a sort key e.g. 01 and strip that in the output files in order not to pollute the output file names. That works badly for directories since they must keep the key data in order not to break the directory structure.

That is errorprone and breaks the keepitsimple no metadata approach.p  pDo you have an idea What would you dop

They would have to be percent encoded to be standards compliant.p  pMy main point, though, is serving the unencoded characters for the sole purpose of having nicelooking URLs, so percent encoding is out. p  pAll major browsers seem to be parsing those URLs okay no matter what the RFC says. My general impression, though, is that it gets very shaky when leaving the domain of web browsersp  ul liURLs getting copypasted into text files, EMails, even Web sites with a different encoding li liHTTP Client libraries li liExotic browsers, RSS readersli ul  pIs my impression correct that trouble is to be expected here, and thus its not a practical solution yet if youre serving a nontechnical audience and its important that all your links work properly even if quoted and passed onp  pIs there some magic way of serving nicelooking URLs in HTMLp  precodehttpwww.example.comdsseldorfneighbourhoodLrick codepre  pthat can be copypasted with the special characters intact, but work correctly when reused in older clientsp
Negative 66383 pWe would like to create some simple automated tests that will be created and maintained by testers. Right now we have a tester who can code in any language, but in the future we might want any tester with a limited knowledge of programming to be able to add or modify the tests.p  pWhat is a good programming language for testers who are not great programmers, or programmers at allp  pSomeone suggested LUA, but I looked into LUA and it might be more complicated that another language would be. p  pPreferably, the language will be interpreted and not be compiled. Let me know what you think.p  pUpdate C and C are under the hood. No one is aspiring to be a programmer really ... it just might be something they could potentially work on if they can handle the task.p  pUpdate 2 I am a software engineer who happens to be a tester right now. I am very knowledgeable about the entire lifecycle ... including developing code, so for me I could go with any language but Im trying to think of other testers who arent as knowledgeable about programming as I am.p  pUpdate 3 The language will need to be able to make calls to the C code easily.p

Negative 66383 pI know that it isnt normally safe to modify a commit from a precommit hook in Subversion because SVN clients will not see the version that has been committed, and will cache the wrong thing, but Id like to clean the code from a versioningnave WebDAV client that wont keep a local cached copy. The idea is that when I look at the repository with an SVN client, the diffs are clean.p  pThe client, by the way is MS Word, using 2003 XML format files. Were already using this format in a WebDAV system, but wed like to add a versioning capability for expert users.p  pEverywhere I look for documentation on how to modify the code in a precommit hook, I get the answer Dont do this, not the answer Heres how to do this, but its reccomeded you dont, so I cant even easily try it to see if its going to cause me problems.p

Negative 66383 pI need to compress some spatially correlated data records. Currently I am getting 1.2x1.5x compression with zlib, but I figure it should be possible to get more like 2x. The data records have various fields, but for example, zlib seems to have trouble compressing lists of points.p  pThe points represent a road network. They are pairs of fixedpoint 4byte integers of the form XXXXYYYY. Typically, if a single data block has 100 points, there will be only be a few combinations of the top two bytes of X and Y spatial correlation. But the bottom bytes are always changing and must look like random data to zlib.p  pSimilarly, the records have 4byte IDs which tend to have constant high bytes and variable low bytes.p  pIs there another algorithm that would be able to compress this kind of data better Im using C.p  pstrongEditstrong Please no more suggestions to change the data itself. My question is about automatic compression algorithms. If somebody has a link to an overview of all popular compression algorithms Ill just accept that as answer.p

Negative 66383 pIve implemented a small proofofconcept app using Core Data to accept some object attribute values from the user via text fields and its all working great thanks to information found here and in the iPhone Core Data Recipes app.  But Im at the point where I need to display object validation errors to the user and I cant find a recommended way of handling this.  The code in the Recipe app just logs the error and says to Replace this implementation with code to handle the error appropriately. Great, thanks.p  pIm sure there are a multitude of ways to interpret, parse and transmit the validation error information to the user but what Id like to know is if there are some best practices or a pattern that someone has implemented that I could follow.  Where should the validation code like code[newObject valdiateForInsertamperror]code be placed In NSManagedObject subclasses  In the UIViewController that handles the screen the enables the object to be added  Maybe in an appwide ValidationControllerp  pAll the validation errors are returned in the NSErrors userInfo, which is a NSDictionary of various NSValidation keys and values.  Is there a good way of translating this error info into something that would be helpful to the user  For example, I have a rule in my Core Data model that a certain attribute can only be 3 characters long. If in the process of saving or updating an object I get a validation error, I need to parse out the NSError userInfo and find values for the NSValidationErrorKey the name of the attribute, the NSValidationErrorValue the value on the object that caused the error and the NSValidationErrorPredicate the rule that was violated, which in this case returns codelength lt 3code.p  pIs there a good, generally accepted way of gathering and munging this data into something that can be passed back to the user  Im currently pulling the NSError info into strings and then falling through a series of conditional statements for each attribute that Im validating, and its so ugly that I kinda want to puke when I look at it.  There has to be a better, cleaner way to consume Core Data validation errors and pass a readable version to the user.p

Negative 66383 pIn theory, its very easy to build a Win32 app with a resource file using cmake. In an codeaddexecutablecode command, a resource file can be listed as easily as a C or C source file. There is a known bug, however, when building using MinGW tools.p  pI found a workaround, which is to include the following in CMakeFiles.txt...p  precodeifMINGW   setCMAKERCCOMPILERINIT windres   ENABLELANGUAGERC   SETCMAKERCCOMPILEOBJECT       ltCMAKERCCOMPILERgt ltFLAGSgt ltDEFINESgt o ltOBJECTgt ltSOURCEgt endifMINGW codepre  pUnfortunately, this doesnt seem to work. What seems to happen is that codewindrescode generates a codeltwhatevergt.rc.rescode file which codeldcode doesnt understand.p  pIn my searches, Ive developed a strong suspicion that Win32 support is seen as a very low priority, especially outside of Visual Studio. This is understandable, as Win32 obviously isnt as important as it once was. And of course Visual Studio Express Editions are easily available for free.p  pEven so, it would be convenient for me if I could use MinGW GCC for a few old Win32 apps I still use. If nothing else, I can get GCOV test coverage stats.p  pObviously if all else fails, I could always handle resource files using a custom build command. One issue is that Im not familiar with either windres or ld, or how MinGW is meant to handle Win32 resource files. Another is that I dont really want to reinvent the wheel if someone already has a superior wheel theyd like to share with me.p  pSo thats basically it  how can I support building Win32 apps with resource files using cmake, and using MinGW but not breaking support for Visual Studiop

Negative 66383 pA data provider java, hibernate has an API for accessing instances of JPAannotated classes. A webservice jaxws is exposing the API to the network clients. A bit of a problem Im thinking to solve is that a client of the data provider cannot be easily reconfigured to either use the provider directly or over the webservice. The reason is that for any persistent class there is a definition of this class in jaxws client code and in data provider code, they are identical structurally but are different classes in Java. The obvious solution of putting generated classes to the same namespace as the original classes and setting up a class path in such a way that generated classes are always ignored doesnt seem ot be a clean one.p  pHas anyone solved this or knows a better wayp

Negative 66383 pI have a Map View defined in IB and it is set to show the user location.p  pIn my app, in emviewDidAppearem, I query self.mapView.userLocation.location.coordinate and it comes back with insane values such asp  pemlatitudeem 4.8194501961644877e49br emlongitudeem 2.2993313035571993e59p  pHowever, the next time emviewDidAppearem is called after Ive simply moved to another tabbed view and then back to this one the emuserLocationem property holds exactly the correct values for my current location.p  pIt seems that at the time of my initial call, the emuserLocationem property has not been initialised but despite having read Apples documentation I cant see any caveats where it says that this property is only valid after doing xxx.p  pIs there something that has to happen before emuserLocationem is valid to use or should I just use emCLLocationManagerem and ask it insteadp  pThanks in advance for any help.p  pSadly, Thomas suggestion didnt help. What I have since discovered isp  pIf emshowsUserLocationem is NO, then emuserLocationem is never set correctly and emMapViewdidUpdateUserLocationem is never called, consequently I never ever get a sensible location value.p  pSo, to get the users location I have to set emshowsUserLocationem to YES, however that then means that after all my annotations have been added to the view without including the users location I then calculate the required span to encompass them all and display them all at the right zoom level. After I do that though, the view jumps sideways as the Map View then automatically displays the users location as the blue blob As it was never included in the annotations to work out the zoom level I cant incorporate it into my calculations. Aaarghp  pNote that when emshowsUserLocationem is YES, then emMapViewdidUpdateUserLocationem is called, but only after Ive calculated all the coordinates of my annotations, not beforep

However I need some way to get these values dynamically.p  pWhen a person purchases multiple items, I get POST values returned such asp  precodeitemnamefoo itemname1bar itemname2blah codepre  pI was thinking that Ill have to do some sort of Regular Expression to get the values, but Im not sure about the syntax, or if its even possible to use RegEx on a superglobal.p  pmaybe something like  p  precodeexp  itemnamed foreachPOST as key gt val      pregmatchexp,key,match  codepre  pAs you can tell, Im really bad with RegExs. Any help would be greatly appreciated. p  pEDIT  p  pOkay, theres two main POST keys that I need to catch. The problem is there may be any number positive integer after the key namep  precodeitemname itemname1 itemname2  itemnumber itemnumber1 itemnumber2 codepre  pBut the ending digit can go all the way to 10, depending upon the number of products purchased. What I need to do is grab the values for each one of these, and add each itemnumber to a string to be inserted into a transaction table in my database. Perhaps something closer top  precodeitms   foreachPOST as key gt val      if strposkey, itemname  0              ifitms                        itms  val                  else                      itms . ,.val                     dont really want to do it like this because id have to do it 10 times     if strposkey, itemname1  0              ifitms                        itms  val                  else                      itms . ,.val                 insert into DB after collecting all values codepre  pAnd yes, this is from an IPN.p  pEDIT 2  This is what I have for my IPN listener scriptp  precode     case ipnHandle          header           retArray  array         req  cmdnotifyvalidate          foreach POST as key gt value                      value  urlencodestripslashesvalue             req . ampkeyvalue                    post back to PayPal system to validate         header .

Negative 66383 pFirst post on StackOverflow, but Ive always looked to this site as a great source of shared knowledge, and Im excited to see what comes up from this question.p  pAs I feel I have now reached the limits of what I can do with SQL indexes, statistics and fulltext search, Im currently looking for a search library that can provide us with the functionality we need.  Im not averse to writing it myself and opensourcing it if I can get the bosss approval, but I would prefer to find something opensource that already exists, natch.p  pWhat were after is a search engine that can provide statistics about the results that are matched when a user searches for a specific keyword.  Lets say, for example, that we were talking about a database of products in an online shop.  We need to be able to return statistics about emhow manyem products there are that match a given set of keywords and also be able to filter this result set by price, category, etc, as well as the total number of products in stock assuming that this is stored in a field in the product table.  All the search engines that I have found return the top emnem results, and if you want statistics about the size of the result set, you need to enumerate the whole set.  Even if you didnt you still would need to do so to retrieve the total number of products in stock.p  pIs there anything anyone knows of that is capable of this functionality  As I say, Im happy to get my hands dirty and either build it myself, or modify the functionality of something like Lucene, but I have not been able to find anything appropriate on Google.p  pThanks in advance guysp

Negative 66383 pI have an application which runs on cgi. I have ported it to modperl2  using apache2compat and rewriting the cgi file into a modperl handler. Strangely, the performance I am obtaining due to the modperl is over shadowed by the latency in the logging.p  pThe logging mechanism in the application is like loggerlogmsgmsgp  ploggerlogmsg  my msg  shift open LOGFILE, logfile print LOGFILE msg close LOGFILE p  pThere is a lot of logging done by the application and is controlled by different levels of logging. When i turn off logging, the transaction work 80 faster on modperl than on cgi code base is same. I am just running using a handler for modperl and gateway script for cgi. when i turn on logging application on modperl runs 80 slower.p  pFrom the logs, I could see that same log module takes .01 seconds for appending msg into file when run as cgi script and .03 seconds when run thro modperl handler.p  pI have tried different methods like using STDOUT and redirecting the same to log file, using requestobjlog method, etc but I cant beat the time taken by cgi.

Negative 66383 pIs there a way to add columns to an existing table using sqlalchemy  Looking at options, it seems like sqlalchemymigrate is the popular option, but it seems to be designed around static changes.

Negative 66383 pPreamble  p  pI am running an online Java ApplicationTomcatJavaMysql as SAAS Software As A Service. This is basically a mobile utility service where a user connects to our serviceserver using his mobile phone and the data transfer happens once the user is authenticated. The service is run on a Data Center with app servers being served the requests by a loadbalancer and so on. Live updates of our application happen by adding and removing servers, diverting the requests by the loadbalancer, without actually taking the service fully down. p  pScenario  p  pFrom the logs, I can understand that there are at least ten thousand users connected to the service all the time. So taking the service down for an upgrade is not practical. I do use a lot of in memory cache using Javas APIslike HashMap, ArrayList etc. I am yet to use Caching frameworks like memcache or so. Also people connect to this service using a plethora of Mobile Phones and we are finding it very difficult to support all of them. p  pUse casep  pWhen a user complaints that the service is not working for them, we need to enable logging for himAND HIM ALONE AND NOT FOR OTHERS to find what goes wrong at his end. Remember that his client is a cellphone, and as this is an online service, we cannot just enable logs in our server and it will be enabled for all the users and our logs will rollover in no time or the users data will not be easily traceable in the gamut of text churned out by the logger. Also I cannot request for a screen shotthough a few cellphones have this feature, majority lacks it and they are the ones that makes trouble for client side errors, I am not able to see what happens on their mobile client. So things need to be done on a live server, while other users continue unaffected. p  pstrongWhat are the different ways where I can enable logging for only one user by supplying some parameter at runtime which enables logging for them at will when they are actually connected to the serverstrongp  pSimple things I tried hastilyp  p1 Keep a single column table, which is initially empty and when some user says that the service is not working for him, add his username in the table. A thread which scans the table at a specific interval will get the username and starts printing the user specific logs. Remove the entry once the logs are printed. But I need to wait till the thread comes and does the action.  Also as a policy, we are not supposed to spawnrun other threads than the requestresponse thread. p  p2 Keep an empty file and add entry in it and follow the same way as in db table mentioned in point 1p  p3 Issue a request to a admin authenticated private Servletusers cannot access this, only internal IPs are allowed and pass the username which is to be logged as a paramvalue  and later invoke it again to remove the userp  pany otherbetter waysp  pPS.

Negative 66383 pWe have a concret directiory e.g. Cpersonalappcherry where while the runtime of another application a folder with 2 significant information in its name will be generated randomly.

Negative 66383 pIn a single operation, I am inserting multiple rows into a table.  It is possible for one or more of those rows to cause an ActiveRecordRecordInvalid issue.  When this happens, I would like to be able to back out all the transactions for this particular operation and have the user fix the data before proceeding.  What is the best way to go about doing thisp  pRight now, if it  fails on the 2nd row of data, the 1st one has already been committed to the database so the user will not know if they should reload that first row or not.  I can just inform the user how many rows succeeded and they can know to fix and reload only from that part on, but it would be better for me if I could just undo everything and have the user start over after they fix their data.p  pFYI, the user initially loads a CSV file into a table that contains on row for every rowcolumn of their csv file and I import from that importtable.p  pThis is a piece of my method in the controllerp  precode  def processimport      import  ImportTable.findparams[id]     cells  import.importcells     newdonors  Array.new     existingdonors  Array.new     classname  Donor                klass  ActiveRecord.constgetclassname  get access to class      loop through rows     0.uptoimport.rowcount  1 do rowindex       donor         donation          recordstatus  new            row  cells.select  cell cell.rowindex  rowindex         loop through columns       0.uptoimport.columncount  1 do columnindex         contents  row.select  cell cell.columnindex  columnindex[0].contents          case columnindex           when 0 then   recordstatus  contents           when 1 then   donor[id]  contents           when 2 then   donor[prefix1]  contents           when 3 then   donor[firstname1]  contents           when 4 then   donor[middlename1]  contents           ...         end case       end columns        unless donor  Donor.findbyiddonor[id]         donor.deleteid         donor  klass.findorinitializebycompanyandprefix1andfirstname1andlastname1andaddress1donor        end        donor.newrecord  newdonors.pushdonor  existingdonors.pushdonor           donor.save        if donation[amount].blank         donation  donor.donations.builddonation         donation.save          end      end rows      import.processeddate  Time.now    import.save    end codepre

So if I have a list of tickers, I need to use a for loop to go through each ticker and grab the bar data. But what I really want to do is to have a single data.frame I think that has the datetime as the first column, and each column after that is the price data say, the closing price for a single stock, where all of these are aligned to the same list of datetimes.

Otherwise, just like you run two session of hyperterminal in the same COM, it wouldnt work. Anybody got a hint bout this Did I miss anything in my codep
Negative 66383 pI must be stupid or something, but Im looking at several JOGL samples online and they use the color3f method of the GL interface in JOGL, but the compiler complains it cant find the method and when Im checking the javadoc I indeed cant find it a hrefhttpjogamp.orgdeploymentjogampnextjavadocjogljavadocjavaxmediaopenglGL.html relnofollowhttpjogamp.orgdeploymentjogampnextjavadocjogljavadocjavaxmediaopenglGL.htmlap  pSo how come theres several samples of code I can find on google that uses GL.glColor3f, but I cant find the method in javadoc  Am I missing somethingp
Negative 66383 pI have a hashmap that contains 10 children hashmap, each of these child hashmap 5 keys mapping to a String array.

The only thing now forcing the language selection is the cookie, but that is still the same as before on that request, so I wont see the new language until I refreshed the page. Nothing I tried so far with the rules had an effect on that behaviour. Interestingly, with this rule the old behaviour documented above still works fine. Its only if I request something different from codecode that it does strange things.p  pThis is on shared hosting within a FreeBSD jail so I cant enable the rewrite log as I dont even know the physical path where the files are besides, it quite clearly seems to ignore the environment variable and only using the cookie for setting the preferred language for some reason. And I havent figured out why so far. Any helpp

Negative 66383 pI have a problem in my dev Magento store in that I can not save a new customer or edit an existing customer.  I get the Please Wait box forever.  The animation in the box moves a frame or two every so often but otherwise doesnt do anything.  If I refresh the page it loads successfully but the changes have not been applied.  I get no errors in the logs or on the page.  All the other questions people have posted about this are either not related to customers or throw errors.  This does nothing....it just sits there.  I think its failing on the validation, but I dont understand why.  It doesnt even work when I try to hit the Save button without making any changes.p  pI did recently delete some 35000 customers that were imported from our main store, so I figured that might have something to do with it even though it was working since then and only broke recently.

At this point I have to imagine its a file and not a database issue, but despite reverting all recent changes, nothing has helped.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions on debugging this andor have you run into this beforep  pThanksp

Negative 66383 pI just finished converting one of our inhouse framework projects from ant to maven.  The maven build runs fine, and deploys to our repository with no issues.p  pThe problem is when other projects try to consume the framework, it does not work.  The only thing downloaded is top level framework pom.p  pI have tried adding some dependency entries to one or more of the various modules, but no matter which one I add, I get a circular dependency error.  I also tried creating a 2nd top level pom file with no modules and a few dependencies to overwrite the one in the repository manager.  This causes some of the dependencies to be downloaded, but then the maven build will hang in random places.  based on windows task manager, it looks like its in an endless loop.  So a 2nd pom file does not appear to be the answer or im doing it wrong.p  pmy framework pom file looks something like thisp  precodeltprojectgt   ltmodelVersiongt4.0.0ltmodelVersiongt    ltgroupIdgtframeworksntltgroupIdgt   ltartifactIdgtSFPltartifactIdgt   ltpackaginggtpomltpackaginggt   ltnamegtSFP frameworkltnamegt   ltversiongt6.3ltversiongt    ltmodulesgt .... 50 modules here   ltmodulesgt codepre  pand then the usual properties, dependency management and pluginManagement entries for a top level pom.p  pin the consuming module I just have the followingp  precodeltdependencygt   ltgroupIdgtframeworksntltgroupIdgt   ltartifactIdgtSFPltartifactIdgt   ltversiongt6.3ltversiongt   lttypegtpomlttypegt ltdependencygt codepre  pThis is in the top level pom so all submodules have access to the framework libraries to make it easier on the developers.p  pHow do I set things up so so all the dependent jar files will be downloaded by my consuming projects p

Negative 66383 pWere starting to adopt Symfony 2 for projects here at work, which is great, but theres a challenge Im working to solve that Ive almost got, but not quite.p  pSymfony treats the concept of an environment as a separate runtime on a single server.  This is great because you can switch between runtimes with different front controllers web or using the env switch cli at a whim.p  pHowever, our code is deployed across many servers as part of the development process.  Everybody has a local VM, then code propagates up through Integration, QA, Staging, and finally Production.p  pSo, our concept of an environment is server virtual or physical.

Im familiar with the various ORMs that can create the classes.  What Im looking for is something that will generate the LoadDataIntoListOfTickets listing with a line of source code for each ROW in the database. Hopefully that makes it clear.p  pClarification 2 This is going to be used to replace having SQL INSERT statements in a text file for initializing tables when the user creates a new database for an application. Having a text file with the SQL INSERT statements allowed me to use traditional version control tools to manage our database initialization process.  It works really well, but it isnt as human readable whitespace  alignment or reusable as storing the data in DTO instances would be.  Serializing to XML would reduce readability. Binary serialization would by nature make it NOT human readable and would also make it near impossible to do a meaningful comparemerge with previous versions.p  pDoes anyone know of a tool or library that can do this p

Negative 66383 pIs it possible to reference Java types with a partially qualified name If so, howp  pThe scenario I frequently find myself with a data class e.g. codeActivitycode which needs a view. My standard practice has been to name this class codeActivityViewcode, which works, but this view class invariably ends up in a codetld.organization.project.viewscode namespace, where the View suffix is entirely redundant. p  pId like to remove View suffix so the types would be codetld.organization.project.Activitycode and codetld.organization.project.views.Activitycode, but this means I must use the namespace to qualify the types when I reference them in the same class. Using the namespace to qualify type references is not a bad thing in and of itself, but repeating the fully qualified name of either type is repetitious and difficult to read. p  pReferencing a empartiallyem qualified type something like code.Activitycode or code.views.Activitycode would remove that cruft. Some kind of type aliasing would answer, but it appears Java doesnt support such functionality. Are there any alternativesp

Negative 66383 pI am smooth scrolling a bitmap at a given speed. Im doing this with a game loop. It scrolls pretty smoothly, around 60 fps, except for occasional stutters  jumps. These jumps occur anywhere from once a second to a couple of times a second.  Usually they start or become more frequent after a few seconds of running, but Im not sure if this is a big clue or not.p  pThe reason for the jumps is that occasionally an iteration of the run loop will take about twice as long as usual, so the bitmap stays in one place for a while and then jumps further to catch up and maintain its constant speed. I used interpolation to figure out the new position of the bitmap with each update based on the time that has elapsed.  When a longer than usual time has elapsed, Ive tried doing a couple of miniupdates instead of moving the entire distance at once, but the paused bitmap is still very noticeable.p  pI ran traceview, and the extra time is being spent inside lockCanvas. Most of the time this method takes around 10 ms, but in these long cases, it takes around 24ms.  When I traced for four seconds, this happened 7 times.p  pIn the following code, Im having it sleep for a bit if it ran fast, but thats not actually making any difference. If I get rid of that part of the code my problem is not solved. There doesnt need to be a constant frame rate, since Im just calculating the position based on how much time has passed.p  precodeOverride     public void run             long beginTime  0      the time when the cycle begun          long timeDiff       the time it took for the cycle to execute          int sleepTime       ms to sleep lt0 if were behind          sleepTime  0         while mRun              Canvas c  null              try                  beginTime  System.currentTimeMillis                  c  mSurfaceHolder.lockCanvasnull                 synchronized mSurfaceHolder                       if mMode  STATERUNNING                          updatePhysics                                          doDrawc                                 catchException e                 System.out.printlne.getStackTrace             finally                   if c  null                      mSurfaceHolder.unlockCanvasAndPostc                                           timeDiff  System.currentTimeMillis  beginTime              sleepTime  intFRAMEPERIOD  timeDiff              ifsleepTime gt 0                   try                      Thread.sleepsleepTime                   catch InterruptedException e                             codepre  pThe code to updatePhysics and doDraw do a little bit of math, and Ive tried to make that as efficient as possible.

Although Im not even sure this is possible since visiting a subdomain would take me to a completely different IIS application, unless I can bind a subdomain to point to the actual domain on my IIS. p  precodefoobar.com es.foobar.com ru.foobar.com codepre  pThe problem I see with this approach is that each table would be gargantuan in size, not only in number of fields, but also in number of records. Im not sure if this would be a problem.p  hr  pI would appreciate some suggestions on how to implement localization for user generated content in an MVC3 application.p  pMeaning, a user visiting the Spanish version codees.foobar.comcode would see other spanish content and comments made by users, and emnotem other versions.

Negative 66383 pWhen a user clicks a photo in their photo album, or even on their wall, Facebook overlays a lightbox of the image at larger dimensions complete with Like link and comments box.p  pIs there an API, maybe using UI Dialogs, that we can use to put this functionality in to our Facebook canvas apps or Mobile URL websitesp  pMy understand is that this functionality is strongnotstrong available to us as developers  an understanding that comes from searching around on Google, on FB and one or two similar questions here on SO albeit from last year. If possible id just like some uptodate confirmation that this is still the case because FB changes every 5 minutes these days...p  pCheers p

Negative 66383 pThis is kind of a double question, just thinking of ways to accomplish my problem.  Also, Im pretty new to DB2 and stored procedures, so bear with me. p  pIm creating a stored procedure that gets a value from two tables using a Left Join statement.  This will result in some of the values in the second table returning a null value since they dont exist in tableB.  p  precodeDECLARE CURSOR C1 WITH RETURN FOR  select a.name, a.title, b.order from tableA a left outer join tableB b on a.name  b.name codepre  pNow, I need some way to set these null values to a default value of 0.p  pThe program Im working with can do it  codeCASTIRONcode  but if the result set is too large, it slows down the orchestrations and truncates the job log.

Negative 66383 pI am currently working with Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 and the new Fakes framework. And after adding my unit tests to the MSBuild and continuous integration process, the Fakes unit tests happen to raise a ShimNotSupportedException.p  pI tried different stuff and read into that issue and found out that, this only happens when I run my tests from the Resharper feature, or directly in the code with MSTest. These exceptions DO NOT occur when running from the Test menu bar, which made me think about checking the setting files of this features.p  pAfter further research I found some articles where it says that it might has something to do with the code coverage setting specified in the Resharper or MSTest settings and if you switch that off, it solves the issue. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11632108shimnotsupportedexceptioninmsvisualstudio2012ShimNotSupportedException in MS VisualStudio 2012a also relates to that problem. p  pI also found some input on the MSDN about that issue, which confirmed me that it has to do something with the code coverage a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSvstestthread17fcfdc61cda4692a242656b48195327httpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSvstestthread17fcfdc61cda4692a242656b48195327a and a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSvstestthreadbfa792b0b3fc4a51b49df7aaf1f2f4b8httpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUSvstestthreadbfa792b0b3fc4a51b49df7aaf1f2f4b8a.p  pNevertheless, since I have to implement code coverage into the continuous integration process somehow soon, and skipping that part is not an option, I am now asking here for any advice regarding this issue, and if there is any kind of solution to that problemp  pThanks for all advicep

I used glOrthof to set it up the 2d perspective and used the gltranslatef method to move my textures.

Negative 66383 pI have been working for some time on an application form for an insurance company.  They sell travel insurance.p  pAs an additional small feature they have asked me to take the dates the depart and return dates the user inputs, calculate the number of days between them and then display number in the days box.  The goal of which is so that the user can enter the two dates and have the number of days autocalculated.p  pI have already created a function which properly calculates the date and I have tested it using manually assigned date values.p  pMy issue has come up when using the JS calendar.p  pWhat I tried to do was use the onblur of the second box to access the function and spit the date out into the days box.  I quickly realized that the onblur is triggered before the code for the JS calendar puts in the date, hence there is no date for the function and the function does not run.p  pI then tried to use onchange and realized it would not work either because the user is not actually changing the date, code is.p  pSo what I tried to do next was use an Interval to trigger the function, this is where I have run into issues.p  pBelow is my code in my caldate.js file which is attached to my HTML form.p  precode    var namestart  new Array  namestart[0]  travemersingledatego namestart[1]  travemerextenddatego namestart[2]  allincsingledatego namestart[3]  allincannualdatego namestart[4]  canceldatego namestart[5]  visitorsupervisadatego namestart[6]  visitorstudentdatego namestart[7]  visitorxpatdatego  var namend  new Array  namend[0]  travemersingledateba namend[1]  travemerextenddateba namend[2]  allincsingledateba namend[3]  allincannualdateba namend[4]  canceldateba namend[5]  visitorsupervisadateba namend[6]  visitorstudentdateba namend[7]  visitorxpatdateba  var names  new Array  names[0]  travemersingledays names[1]  travemerextenddays names[2]  allincsingledays names[3]  allincannualdays names[4]  canceldays names[5]  visitorsupervisadays names[6]  visitorstudentdays names[7]  visitorxpatdays       function daysBetween   for var i  0 i lt 8 i      Get the value of the current form elements var start  document.getElementByIdnamestart[i].value var end  document.getElementByIdnamend[i].value  Duration of a day var d  1000606024   Split Date one var x  start.split  Split Date two var y  end.split    Set Date one object var d1  new Datex[0],x[1]1,x[2]    Set Date two object var d2  new Datey[0],y[1]1,y[2]      Calculate difference diff  Math.ceild2.getTimed1.getTimed  Show difference document.getElementByIdnames[i].value  diff     function interval  var int  setIntervalfunctiondaysBetween,500  codepre  pThe list of arrays at the beginning is the names of the elements which I need to access.

Negative 66383 pIm coming from different MVC frameworks e.g. Symfony to Magento. I read a lot about Magento best practices and I can see Magento doesnt use the typical MVC style. Alan Storm wrote the followingsp  blockquote   pits not the responsibility of the controller to set variables for the   view [...] controllers job is to do certain things to Models, and   then tell the system its layout rendering time.p blockquote  pI think I understand this approach as this can provide a kind of flexibility for blocks.p  pRight. But what about formsp  pIn a typical MVC framework you will get the request parameters in the controller, validate form data in the controller, make model operations save, load, etc or redirections if necessary there, and when everything is clean and tidy, you will provide the freshly baked output pieces for the view.p  pIn Magento these all should happen inside a block and the thin controller is only supposed to prepare the layout and then render it. If I understand.p  pI tried to find an article manual, forum topic, anything, which describes a creation steps of a separate module with an own new model, which can be editable via a form in the frontend by the user. I would like to see how a custom form should work in the frontend. Ive found only general articles about blocks, forms, modifying or creating adminhtml forms or customising contact or newsletter signup forms.p  pI made it. It works now, but Im not satisfied. So then, I checked the source code of the Contact form in the core module, and those messed up the entire picture for me. The builtin Contact form uses the IndexController to most of the above mentioned operations, almost like a standard MVC.p  pCould anyone suggest to me a best practice, how to manage a simple flow like the following Ive got a solution for these below, but Im not sure, is that the right Magento wayp  ul liWhen the page loads, show a form in a block, which is included in the separate pageli liLoad a model object from the DB by a request parameterli liPopulate object data into the formli liWhen user submits the form, process form data, validate themli liIf validation error, show the form again, and pop up error messageli liIf OK, store the data into the DB, show a thank you pageli ul  pMy confusion is mainly aroundp  ul liWhere should I get and manage the request parameter I did it in the block class fileli liAnd load an object from the DB, based on it Also, and then passed to the phtmlli liHow to pass it to the view, if I wouldnt load it there I would know a way, but I dont know the best way.li liWhere should be the POST form data processed, validated and stored Blockli liHow can I use properly redirections in a block Do I need redirection, as the thank you page should be a different block  page Or just an alternativ conditional look of the same blockli ul
Negative 66383 pIm using a hrefhttpsgithub.comblueimpjQueryFileUploadBlueimps jQuery Uploadera very good it is too btw and an S3 handler to upload files and then transfer them to S3 via the S3 API from the PHP SDK.p  pIt works. The problem is, on stronglargestrong files 1GB it can take anything up to a ema few minutesem to transfer via createobject onto S3. The PHP file that does this is hungup until this process is complete. The problem is, the uploader which utilises the a hrefhttpapi.jquery.comjQuery.ajaxjQuery Ajax methoda seems to give up waiting and start again everytime.p  pI have thought this was related to PHP INI maxinputtime or such, as it seemed to wait around 60 seconds, though this now appears to vary. I have upped the maxinputtime in PHP INI and others related  but no further.p  pIve also considered the more likely that JS, either in the script or the jQuery method has a timeout. The developer blueimp has said theres no such timeout in the frontend script, nor have I seen any and though timeout is referenced in the jQuery Ajax method options, it seems to affect the entire time it uploads rather than the wait for a response  so thats not much use.p  pAny help or guidance gratefully received.p

Negative 66383 pI am using the System.Web.Optimization framework to bundle and minify my JavaScript and Im using the section Script  sections to ensure all my JavaScript is defined at the bottom of the page.  This includes resources such as the jQuery stuff.p  pNow, one of my pages has an AJAX function.  When this function returns it returns a Partial View which is then added to the DOM.  This Partial view contains a form and some JavaScript that wires up event handlers for elements within the partial view using unsurprisingly jQuery.p  pNow, I currently have this JavaScript declared in the page within script tags, but Im trying to move to a situation where all my JavaScript is unobtrusive in other words, all in external files.p  pNormally with a Partial, I would ensure that the external JS file is defined in the bundle on the parent View, but this is AJAX, so the document.ready... will fire BEFORE my AJAX returns.p  pIm exploring the jQuerys .on method [which seems to have replaced the deprecated .live method], but is this the best approach or are there others I should considerp  pThanks in advancep  pGriffp

Negative 66383 pI have a blogging program sorta like Twitter, and I am currently making a recently visited box, which contains 9 people who most recently visited your page.p  pEveryone is registered with a different username.p  pWhat Ive currently got is a database like thisp  precode  id  username  whovisit   codepre  pFor example, if 9 users codefoo1code to codefoo9code visited codefoo10codes page, the database would be populated with a rowp  precode  id  username                        whovisit                         1    foo10    foo1, foo2, foo3, foo4, foo5, foo6, foo7, foo8, foo9   codepre  pAnd then when codefoo11code visits codefoo10codes page, I would remove codefoo9code from the end of the string, and add codefoo11code to the front.p  pBut the main problem now is, what if codefoo1code visited codefoo10codes page, then codefoo2code visited codefoo10codes page, and then codefoo1code visited codefoo10codes page again Then I would have to search the 9 users, remove any duplicates, place this one in front, and then continue executing. But the problem is, then it would only show 8 rows.p  pThe only solution to this problem I could think of was making a database like thisp  precode  id  username  whovisit   codepre  pAnd instead of populating them in one row, I would add a new row for every visitp  precode  id  username  whovisit    1    foo10       foo1      2    foo10       foo2      3    foo10       foo3      4    foo10       foo4      5    foo10       foo5      6    foo10       foo6      7    foo10       foo7      8    foo10       foo8      9    foo10       foo9     codepre  pBut then this would takes heaps and heaps of unnecessary space.p  pIs there a method I missed out on, which can efficiently solve this problem without adding  50000 rows for one user in the databasep  pstrongUpdatestrong For those with the same problem, as PM 771 stated below in the comments, one could delete the earliest duplicate row when a new row is inserted.

Negative 66383 pI am working on a homework project where we design a website for a store, and I have been assigned the database. This is my first database attempt. I am using LibreOffice Base for the design, and cannot find any guides on how to make subtypes. For example, for every shirt in the inventory, thered be a different group of colors it comes in and for every different color a list of individual sizes and how many of each size is in stock. However, I cant find aggregation anywhere in Table Relations. So I make a table for shirts with the base information brand, price, etc, and then a separate table with just 2 columns size and number of units in stock  were letting the possibility of multiple colors wait for now. I then make a form for the shirt with the base information and a subform with 2 columns size and number available. Both of the forms are tables rather than labeled text boxes. However, the subform for shirt size does not maintain separate information for each row in the main form ie the one with the base information for the shirts. How the heck do I do thisp  pLastly, since this is my first crack at databases, I would not be at all surprised if Im going at it all wrong, and if so would gladly appreciate a push in the right direction or a webpage explaining how to do this that I didnt find due to not entering the correct search terms.p

Negative 66383 pI am using MVVM with WPF, but I am having a hard time understanding the concepts behind this desing pattern.p  pI have a myclass object that is the state of the application it stores data loaded from the repository. All pages of my application will use this data and the object should be syncronized between them all. p  pMy first approach was to store this data in the service layer, using a singleton class. So, all ViewModel should call this service to get the data. Any modification should also call this service, and a event would be fired to synchronize all views.p  pI am wondering now if it would be better to store this data in the model layer... Whats be best optionp  pEDIT Adding more information The data stored is a list of projects loaded into a solution. Since there must be only one solution, I implemented it as a singleton. The must can interactively load, change, or remove any project.p

Negative 66383 pIm working on a school project about GRAPS and Design Patterns. Its basically a game with a grid on which objects as well as players can move. I was thinking about using a mediator to determine the exact location on which an object should land. p  pEach colleague in this case each item and the grid should be aware of its Mediator object. Design Patterns, Gamma et al. Because of this, I was wondering whether making this mediator a singleton would be considered a good design choice. The mediator is completely stateless and is identical for each object, thereby meeting the applicability requirements stated by the Singleton pattern. p

Negative 66383 pI am considering implementing an array like container, and Im not sure whether to use a gslgslvector or a stdvector.

The container will be referenced constantly in the main program to, for example, input values into tensor functions, amongst other things. I am calling from the container literally billions of times.p  pHere are the pros and cons that Ive considered so far The gslvector is convenient because it will allow me to use the gsl BLAS libraries on occasion, and the codegslvectorget...code call is very efficient. On the other hand, I am able to get almost the same speed of calls using stl iterators, and the stl vector has an interface that I find quite natural.p  pAre there any memory overheadsefficiency issues I should be aware of that Ive overlook in the above codep  pAlso, I am using a codestdvectorltgslvectorgtcode implementation at the moment, and an iterator to traverse the stdvector. Would it be smarter to use a gslmatrix here The idea would be to use gslvectorviews to get the right vector, rather than the iterator. Would this be more efficientp

Negative 66383 pI am trying to post a message to the WIN32 API to open a WAV File. I can do this by setting the LPARAM parameter to LCpathfile.wav This works excelent However, I have been trying to use a dialogbox to generate a string to a filepath. The OpenFileDialog function can return the selected filepath as a LPSTR datatype, which sounds perfect However, this filepath is recognized as a windows filepath, thereby consisting of backslashes. Since these backslashes are not escaped or replaced for a forward slash, the compiler starts crying due to an incorrect formed universal character name.

Negative 66383 pIm trying to build a django app that can monitor and interact with a remote database to interact with the database in a basic way  just performing a lookup and only sometimes making a little change in the remote data, it also has to sometimes store the remote data to its own database.p  pThe website which sits on the remote database is a community website, and anyone without an account is allowed to post on the websites forums. I want the app to be able to check the database every now and then to see for any updates in the discussions. The site gets at least 100 posts an hour and since anyone is allowed to post on the forums without an account, it occasionally gets spammed, but unfortunately the CMS that is being used does not have a good antispam system set up.p  pOnly way that I can think of at the moment is to make a python file, and in that file I can import MySQLdb. I can connect to the remote database mysql server and select all the posts that have been made in the last X minutes. Using a function that calculates the probability of a post being a spam or not, I can again talk to the remote database and flag the candidates to be not displayed on the website. I can have this file run every now and then using emcronem.p  pThe problem here is a lack of control. I want to have a user interface that can show all the spam candidates on a single webpage and have an unflag button to make accidentally flagged posts to be shown on that website again. This means that Ill probably be better off writing a django web app than to write a single python script that simply just flags spam candidates.p  pHow would I have a django app or perhaps a function within that app which can perform all actions that the standalone python script as described above can perform to run automatically every now then say every minutep

Negative 66383 pI am trying to code a functional composition using operator overloading in C, so to have a simple composition syntax similar to the ones in functional languages e.g. Haskell.

I can read the data and assign it to an ArrayList based on if that line contains the rank of the professor, but what I cant figure out is how to take the salaries of each rank pull that number out to add up and then average.

Negative 66383 pWe are having troubles when we are running certain GPU functions e.g. a point tracker where we use texture references on multiple places parallel in multiple CPUthreads all CPU threads use the same GPU. p  pIt seems that the texture references, which afaik are sort of global device variables are the problem, as these are the only global variables we have note constant memory might be probably also a issue but we will focus for now on the texture references problem. We use mainly texture references to 2D images pitchedlinear memory as we are in image processing field.p  pHow can we rewrite the kernels, which use the texture references, so that they are CPUthreadsafe  Is it possible at all  Note that in our framework we plan to have exactly 4 CPU threads for each GPU each CPUthread is a GPUWorkerThread which gets some GPU job issued which he then executed.p  pThis question seems to be related to the problem of arrays of texture references, I dont know if an array of texture reference is possible now with newer Cuda Toolkit  newer GPU architectures.

Then whenever the users need to access pages which require authentication the cookie is sent over and verified with the timestamp and the token against the user, assuming that passes it then issues a new timestamp and sends it back down to the user.p  pThis method works to date and although there are still possibilities of CSRF reduced by the rolling timestamp and a few other vulnerabilities it is a risk that the current project team are willing to live with, there is a big technical debt card to look into better ways, but thats for another discussion, as our main goal was a stateless service so it could scale easily.p  pAnyway that all to one side, the issue now is that we have been asked to expose data to other 3rd parties from the service. They however wont be consuming this data like a normal user with a browser, but as an application of some kind on any sort of platform. So now I am wondering if there is some better way for application based consumers authenticate themselves, as currently they would need to send a http request to authenticate, then take the returned cookie, and send it over for restricted requests. However the other 3rd parties then need to keep juggling this cookie whenever they want to get data from our system, which seems a bit of a pain for them. p  pSo is there another way I cannot see to accomplish this as the 2 ways I can see to keep it stateless are to send some token over on the querystring each time, which again would require them to authenticate and store it, and would make the querystring a bit less clean. Then the other way is as we currently do it using cookies as the state mechanism.p

If you do override Object.EqualsObject,   your overridden implementation is also called in calls to the static   EqualsSystem.Object, System.Object method on your class. In   addition, you should overload the opEquality and opInequality   operators. This ensures that all tests for equality return consistent   results, which the example illustrates.p blockquote  pStarting from this moment I see no reason to implement codeIEquatableltTgtcode for reference types. Can anyone tell me when it has any sense Should I really treat different equality behavior as inconsistent when we look at the type differently as base typep

Negative 66383 pI have a standard html page that has a few img tags, each of these are pointing to a php file on our server.

Negative 66383 pSimply put, here is my questionp  pIf given an IFile, is there a way to check whether that IFile is a code.classpathcode file or a code.projectcode file p  pHere is the full scoopp  pI am implementing a resource synchronizer as part of an Eclipse plugin that is creating a copy codebase a copy of the entire workspace using resource changed messages that I have arranged to be received. These messages indicate which resources I must addchangedelete. For example, when a Java Project is added, I am receiving the following 4 messages in this order p  ol liADD .classpath FILEli liADD .project FILE li liADD org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs FILEli liADD src FOLDER. li ol  pIn order to create the PROJECT resource in this example, I ensure that the parents of each resource in the message exists. So when I create each resource, I check that the resources parent resource exists  if not, I create the parent resource like the PROJECT resource for the first .classpath message in our example and then I recursively check whether the parents parent exists. p  pMy problem is that Eclipse automatically creates a .project file when a PROJECT is created, so the ADD .project FILE message becomes redundant. If I could only detect when I am processing the ADD .classpath FILE message, then I can selectively create a PROJECT, then immediately delete the automatically generated .project file, and not have any conflicts when I process the next message which is the ADD .project FILE. p
Negative 66383 pWe have a requirement in our app wherein we have to communicate across the webnative boundary  between JavaScript running in a codeUIWebViewcode and ObjectiveC in the app.p  pThe web component communicates internally via pagebusa subscription and publishing mechanism and the requirement is that the  native component should also be capable enough to subscribe for those events and listen to them.p  pWe all know that the only official way to call into a codeUIWebViewcode from ObjectiveC is via codestringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromStringcode.  And the typical way to call out from JavaScript is some manner of setting window.location to trigger a codeshouldStartLoadWithRequestcode callback on the codeUIWebViewcode delegate. But this will be not useful to handle page bus events.p  pApple gives us a public JavaScriptCore framework part of WebKit in iOS7, and JavaScriptCore provides simple mechanisms to proxy objects and methods between ObjectiveC and the JavaScript context.p  pUnfortunately, to make use of this framework in achieving our objective, we need the JSContext object of the webview, but there is no mechanism to achieve it. There is a stack overflow link where we found there are two approaches to achieve this both undocumented.p  pApproach 1 Get the JSContext via KVCp  precodeJSContext ctx  [webView valueForKeyPathdocumentView.webView.mainFrame.javaScriptContext] codepre  pApproach 2 Get the JSContext via WebKits codedidCreateJavaScriptContextcode delegate callback.p  pPlease find the reference link below a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18920536whyusejavascriptcoreinios7ifitcantaccessauiwebviewsruntimeWhy use JavaScriptCore in iOS7 if it can39t access a UIWebView39s runtimea The question is can we use either of these methods in our app, so that our app wont get rejected in App Store Or is there any other mechanism to achieve our objective  of listening to pagebus eventsp
Negative 66383 pI have been now two years working deeply with Qt layout system. After this time i encountered thosand of problems with SizePolicies and Layouts. I normally found out solutions, but never really understood what i was doing.p  pNow i was taking some time to try to understand correctly and build a 101 GUIDE for them and never fail. I found out this piece of information in the documentation about QSizePolicy of a QWidgetp  blockquote   pThis property holds the default layout behavior of the widgetp      pIf there is a QLayout that manages this widgets children, the size   policy specified by that layout is used. If there is no such QLayout,   the result of this function is used.p blockquote  pI thought that if you had a QLabel, for example, and you set the policies to Horizontal Expanding, Vertical Fixed, THE LABEL itself changed that way. But it doesnt, at all.p  pWhen reading that i see that it talks about ITS CHILDREN inside the LAYOUT. So what does it mean, then. Nothing is inside the label, is that why it does not work.p  pWHat about inserting a label inside a QFrame, and telling the frame to be Expanding... Will the QFrame expand or stretch depending on the rest of brother widgets in the same Layout or will the label expand or stretch, not the QFramep  pWhat a mess...p  pWhat about Stretching. If you set stretching 10 when you add the widgetp  precodelayoutgtaddwidgetlabel, 10, QtAlignHCenter codepre  pIt doesnt work either.p  pStretch 0 when you add the widget means  Take the policies i told you. Default, depends on the type of widget. Buttonlike widgets have expandingfixed. Boxlike ExpandingExpanding... p  pStretch 10 means grow maximum.p  pAm i right Well. When having a QFrame and a QLabel inside, setting Expanding, and 10 to strech to the label DOES NOT WORK.p

Negative 66383 pI have a user control that has a property that is a list of a custom object type. When I create a custom class by inheriting from Listlt, it mostly worksp  precodepublic class CustomCol  ListltCustomItemgt        ...  codepre  pIm then able to implement the property in the user control something like thisp  precodeCustomCol items  new CustomCol [DesignerSerializationVisibilityDesignerSerializationVisibility.Content] public CustomCol Items      get  return items   codepre  pThis makes it behave as I would expect it to. Im able to click the ellipsis button in the Designer, and it brings up the CollectionEditor, and adding items correctly adds CustomItems.p  pUnfortunately, this method doesnt allow me to detect when items are added, deleted, or modified in the CollectionEditor. After considerable research, I discovered that this is because the designer editor calls IList.Add to add new items, and this is not overridable, so I cannot intercept those calls without implementing my own collection class from the ground up that implements IList.p  pSo that is exactly what I tried to do. The code I attempted looked something like thisp  precodepublic class CustomCol System.Collections.IList      private ListltCustomItemgt  new ListltCustomItemgt      int System.Collections.IList.AddObject value              items.AddCustomItemvalue         return items.Count            All of the other IList methods are similarly implemented.  codepre  pBefore going any further, I already see a problem. The CollectionEditor is going to be passing generic System.Objects, rather than my CustomItem class.p  pSo the next thing I tried was implementing IList instead, as suchp  precodepublic class CustomCol IListltCustomClassgt      private ListltCustomItemgt  new ListltCustomItemgt      void ICollectionltCustomItemgt.AddNameValueItem item              items.Additem            All of the other IList methods are similarly implemented.  codepre  pIn theory, this works, but I cant get the CollectionEditor to launch in the designer at all. Ive been working on this all day, looking for solutions online, experimenting trying to understand how all this works. At this point I have a very severe headache, and am looking for any kind of guidance.p  pTo summarize I want to create a user control with a property that is a custom collection class that I can edit in the Designer using the CollectionEditor or something equivalent and I need to know when those designer changes are made so that I can update the appearance of the control.p

Negative 66383 pNormally, when people advertise a tool to you, they emfirst tell, why you need it at allem and then discuss how to use it. Thats not the case with first 5 books about databases and SQL I tried. It really feels like Im talking to religious cultists . They dont discuss what the database is capable of, why it was designed the way it is designed, etc. They tell you that you should obey the 3rd normal form and Codd, the Prophet of it.p  pMy question is in what respects would my website, using e.g. PostreSQL backend as a data store, be superior to my website storing data in hash tables and using generic serialization mechanism built in my programming language of choice like codepicklecodecodeshelvecode in codepythoncode.p  pI believe the answer is performance, but in this place SQL adepts are usually vague. I wonder, what operations cost so much less with databases How does design help to achieve that Really, when youre struggling with obeying some rules, youd really like to know for what sake all that wasp  pCan you suggest a reading which first states goals then introduces notions of normal forms, relational algebra, etc. and then explains how those notions help solve the goals.

Negative 66383 pI have two tables.

Students can change mentors and I want to always have the current one. I tried to achieve that with query but I didnt get the right results jet. p  pSo I got an idea to to make a query that will update the IDprofessor in the table STUDENTStable and I want the query to be that connection.p  pType of request IDtypeofreq can be 1 meaning choosing mentor and if the professor  approves IDapprovedrejected  1 then the student has its mentor.p  pType of request can also be 3, which means that mentor was mentoring the student but doesnt want to mentor the student anymore the idapprovedrejected in that case is always 1 meaning approved. If that is the last entry than the student doesnt have the mentor anymore and should not be in the result of currently mentoring query. But the student can later choose a new mentor and if is accepted he will get into the result currently mentoring query againp  pThe two tables are not connected, but its no problem to join them if will do the job.p  precode   SELECT a.IDrequest,    a.IDStudent,     a.IDProfessor,    a.Date,     a.IDtypeofreq    FROM [reqtable] AS a    WHERE a.IDtypeofreq1 Or a.IDtypeofreq3 AND a.IDapprovedrejected1    AND a.DateSELECT MAXb.date     FROM [reqtable] AS b     WHERE b.IDrequest   a.IDrequest    ORDER BY a.IDStudent DESC codepre  pI need the code that will catch the last entry and if the type of request is 1 and ID aproovedrejected  1 to put the new idprofessor in the STUDENTStable p  pAnd if the last IDtypeofreq is 3 and IDaproovedrejected  1 to set the value of IDProfessor to Null again.p

I can do this with numpy.tilearray, nz,1,1, but I run out of memory. My specific case has x1500, y2000, z700.p

Negative 66383 pWork has a web site that uses large data sets, load balanced between two MySQL 5.6.1664.2 servers using MyISAM, running on Linux 2.6.32358.el6.x8664 GNULinux. This data is being updated hourly from a text based file set that is received from a MSSQL database. To avoid disruption on reads from the web site and at the same time make sure the updates doesnt take too long following process was put in placep  pHave the data one a third Linux box only used for data update processing, update the different data tables as needed, move a copy of the physical table files to the production servers under a temporary name, and then do a table swap by MySQL TABLE RENAME. p  pBut every time the table under the temporary name is seen by the destination MySQL servers as being crashed and require repair. The repair takes too long, so it cannot be forced to do a repair before doing the table swap. p  pThe processing is programmed in Ruby 1.8.7 by having a thread for each server just as a FYI, this also happens if not doing it in a thread to a single server.p  pThe steps to perform file copy is as followsp  pUse NetSFTP to transfer the files to a destination folder that is not the database folder done due to permissions.

Anyone have an idea of why the tables are being crashed and if there a solution to avoid table crash without having to do a table repairp

But this happens only for the first click. If I click again on the button so that these codelicode items get collapsed, they are not. I found out that codeincode class as you can see above gets appended after first click is not being removed on second click. So what I did was I ran a jQuery like thisp  precodebtnBsTab.clickfunction       if bsexamplenavbarcollapse2.hasClassin          bsexamplenavbarcollapse2.removeClassin      else          bsexamplenavbarcollapse2.addClassin.cssheightauto important          codepre  pHere codebtnBsTabcode is the button id, and I removed the codedatatargetcode attribute from the code. Now this works fine for me but I dont want to do like this way as bootstrap itself offers datatarget functionality that actually handles div id on every click.p  pI am using jquery1.9.0 and bootstrap 3.0.0 css and bootstrap.js also.p

Negative 66383 pIm doing some research about handling errors in Qtbased application and after doing some reading about Qt usage of asserts instead of exception throw I came to the following questionp  pSome methods of Qt classes makes the application immediately crash when an error occur in them. For example, if Im using a Qt container such as QList and calls for a member bigger then the containers size, the software is closed immediatelyp  precodeQListltintgt myList int itemp  myList.at1  Crash codepre  pNow I dont want that to happen in my application if such an event occur, I want to handle that event even if it is just to log something in a error log and close the app later. But how can I do that if Qt crash the software before I can do any error checking And putting the code inside a trycatch wouldnt work since Qt throws nothing when this happens at least not when exceptions are not enabled, which is what I pretend to use. Is there a way to go around this problemp

Negative 66383 pIve been reading The C Programming Language 2nd edition by Brian W Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie in order to learn the C programming language. In it is an example of code that counts the number of times a digit occurs in a string of input. The code is as followsp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt   main        int c, i ,nwhite, nother     int ndigit[10]      nwhite  nother  0     for i 0 i lt 10 i         ndigit[i]  0      while c  getchar  EOF          if c gt 0 ampamp c lt 9             ndigit[c  0]         else if c     c  n  c  t             nwhite         else             nother          printf ndigits      for i  0 i lt 10 i         printf  d, ndigit[i]     printf , white space  d, other  dn, nwhite, nother  codepre  pIf after starting this program, I were to enter 11111, the first if statement of the while loop would notice that these are a series of digits and would thus increment the second element of the array to 5. Im trying to understand the C language as best as I can and i just dont see the logic behind using     p  precodendigit[c  0] codepre  pIf I were to input 11111 into the program, it would correctly return something along the lines ofp  precode0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 codepre  pand thus indicating that 1 was typed five times. Intuitively, I would instead typep  precodendigit[c] codepre  pIt seems to me that because the variable c would be 1 five times, this bit of code would correctly increment not the 0th element but the 1st element of the array to 5, just as it should. If I actually implement this bit of code, however, the same input of 11111 returnsp  precode0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 codepre  pThis I dont understand at all. Now, it seems no elements of the array are being incremented despite the fact I told it to increment the cth element. p  pJust some further testing I went ahead to see what would happen if I implemented p  precodendigit[c  1] codepre  pThe same input of 11111 returned p  precode5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 codepre  pwhich I suppose makes sense as its changing the 11th element of the array. I just still dont understand why the  0 is necessary. If you could help me to understand the usage of this, that would be great. Thanks. p

Some modules   such as JSDOM and MongoDB have optional native dependencies, and will   work with applications hosted in Azure Web Sites.p blockquote  pI deployed everything to Azure using the publishing Wizard and all the files were sent to Azure apparently at least, including the compiled modules.

Negative 66383 pIm trying to put together a very simple logging class which treats certain types, and particularly vectors, specially. I want to have a default behaviour when using the codeltltcode operator, but modify it in certain cases.

The problem is that for emsubclassesem of the vector types, the generalpurpose template seems to take priority, and the more specific template gets ignored.p  pstrikeSince all three templated cases have just one generic template parameter I guess the the vector cases arent considered the most specialised, but if it were considered ambiguous I would expect a compiler error. It compiles just fine. So how can I indicate a specialisation but still generalise over the type of the vector elements Thanks in advance.strikep  pstrikeI guess this is to do with some detail of how the codeColcode class is implemented. Im using and aliasing codearmaColltTgtfixedltNgtcode as well, but writing a specific overload for that doesnt seem to help. Any ideas welcome.strikep

Negative 66383 pIm building a service discovery library for our rack applications to use. Its based on a hrefhttpzookeeper.apache.org relnofollowZooKeepera, and leverages ZooKeepers ephemeral znodes so that when a service loses its connection to ZooKeeper crash, reboot, network partition, its entry in the service registry automatically disappears.p  pMost of our rack applications are managed by a hrefhttpunicorn.bogomips.org relnofollowunicorn.rba.p  pIm not sure where to perform service registration. I cant have every worker process that unicorn spawns handling service registration. So it seems I need some horrible IPC amongst the workers to elect one responsible for service registration or I need unicorn elect and notify a worker or I need to do service registration in unicorn.rb.p  pThe last option seems the least ugly. But where do I do that In afterforkp

Negative 66383 pI have this codes that will display words with checkbox. As you can see they are delimited by comma, and I used split function to explode the string making it an array.

Ive tried it on version 31, 32, and 33 aurorap  pI also have WebGL enabled on Chrome and Firefox.p  pIve written basic OpenGL programs that render boxes and stuff on my local machine. Ive successfully compiled, linked and ran an example OpenCL program that uses the GPU to generate the string Hello world in a buffer and print it on my local machine.p  pIve even been able to run WebGL examples in both Chrome and Firefox. I can also run WebCL examples that dont require WebGL.p  pNow just to clarify beforehand, Im only concerned about Firefox. My Chrome browser currently does not have WebCL functionality and Firefox was much easier to set up with WebCL. I only referred to Chrome to imply that WebGL does work as expected on more than one browser on my machine.p  pThe problem is, oddly enough, if I run a WebCL example before WebGL, WebGL will think there is no graphics driver until Firefox is restarted.p  pSimilarly, if I run a WebGL example before WebCL, WebCL will not be able to find an OpenCL driver on my machine until Firefox is restarted.p  pI only have the WebCL extension installed in Firefox and nothing else.

Negative 66383 pI hope you can help me.p  pI am writing a desktop program that will run in a web browser in HTMLCSSjavascript in case that wasnt clear.  It will be entirely disconnected from the internet and obtain files and data using only FILE protocol.  My question is how can you obtain a listing of the contents of a directory referenced this wayp  pIve been searching for months and really turned up almost nothing  Maybe I just dont know how to search but there doesnt seem to be much information about how browsers actually deal with File protocol.p  pFor example, when you open a directory in Chrome, it gives you a nice table with hyperlinks of all the parent directorys children.  However, when you look at the source code, its as if Chrome just magically knew exactly what files were in the directory.  I feel that if I could understand how it knew that, maybe Id be able to get somewhere...p  pAlso, I am open to other ideas about how to get a directory listing.  Ive read about being able to do it with php but it requires running a server.  Does anyone know if it is possible to run php code with File protocol rather than HTTPp  pThanks for reading this far and truely any information that could remove me from this standstill is appreciatedp

Where as if you import data like that into Microsoft Access or other databases, you get the option to import anyway, or remove special characters.p  pMy only solution to this has been to write an Excel macro to strip out characters not usually liked by databases when importing  and then import the file using python.p  pBut there must be a way of handling this situation purely using python which is a lot faster.p  pMy question, how does python handle importing .xls and .xlsx files when the column headings have special characters which wont importp

This has always worked fine in XNA, but Monogame seems to have trouble.p  pIve been getting an access violation error when content is being loaded.

Negative 66383 pI am trying to use SQL only to select the common overlapping time intervals from sets of grouped time intervals or emperiodsem, which is probably the proper word.p  pThe real world scenario is a call centre with 3 empositionsem that can receive telephone calls. Positions are filled by specific service reps and their assignments to positions change over time but that is irrelevant to this problem. We can assume that for a given position it is always filled by someone.p  pThe number of positions changes slowly over time. I am trying to generalize the solution so it can handle an arbitrary number of positions.p  pThe input data is a set of emcallsem that are directed to a position and have a start time and end time. Obviously a given position can not have overlapping calls with itself assume only one call at a time can be taken but its calls can overlap in time with one or more calls made to other positions.p  pstrongThe problem is to identify from the call data all the time intervals when ALL positions are on a call and thus the call centre is unable to answer any new incoming calls for that period all positions busy.strongp  pE.g., for three positions numbered 1, 2 3p  precodeCall  Position  CallStartTime      CallEndTime  1     1         20140101 1401   20140101 1433     ltComprises all busy intervals 1 and 2 2     1         20140101 1445   20140101 1447   3     1         20140101 1453   20140101 1457   4     2         20140101 1301   20140101 1353     5     2         20140101 1355   20140101 1425     ltcomprises all busy interval 1 6     2         20140101 1427   20140101 1429     ltcomprises all busy interval 2 7     2         20140101 1435   20140101 1441   8     3         20140101 1421   20140101 1503     ltcomprises all busy intervals 1 and 2 9     3         20140101 1601   20140101 1611 codepre  pFor the test data above there are TWO time intervals when all positions are busy distinct cases of overlapping calls for all positions 1421  1425 and 1427  1429.p  pSo the desired result set would bep  precodeAllBusyStartTime  AllBusyEndTime 20140101 1421  20140101 1425 20140101 1427  20140101 1429  codepre  pYou see that one call can have multiple overlaps with other calls e.g., call position 1 14011433 overlaps with both call position 2 13551425 and call position 2 14271429. p  pTwo time intervals a, b overlap when a.StartTime lt b.EndTime and a.EndTime  b.StartTime.p  pIf I can get the set of call time intervals where there is an overlap for all positions, the associated all busy time interval consists of the GREATEST most recent StartTime from the set and the LEAST oldest EndTime.p  pTo get closer to the solution I am looking for a generalizable algorithm to determine when n time intervals are mutually overlapping. For intervals a, b, c selecting a overlaps b and a overlaps c is not restrictive enough. A could overlap b but b might not overlap c and you need all of the intervals to overlap with each other.p  pI am using SQL Server for my testing. I have tried searching the web but have not found anything that covers exactly this case lots of discussion on simple cases of two overlapping time intervals. I would share the SQL but I am still trying to figure out the method, which is needed for that to be illuminating.p  pEven though I have only SQLServer for my testing I would like to keep the solution as generic as possible as it will probably not be implemented on SQL Server.p

Negative 66383 pWe have a number of iOS apps that several different developers contribute to.

There were 269 differences in the XML between the two versions of the file, all of them being these slight changes in frame sizes or positions. The storyboard XML is 9000 lines.p  pIt seems the issue may have something to do with IBs use of floating point numbers and rounding errors and the differences that become off by a few pixels could be an aggregation of these rounding errors over a period of several times opening, parsing and reserializing the data.p  pThis is just a theory though as Ive not been able to pinpoint the exact cause of the unwanted changes. Often commits dont make any significant changes to the frames at all, only insignificant floating point changes such as 446.00000055262581  446.00000112002783. But when the serious changes occur, they seem to occur in large numbers.p  pThe commits between which the changes occur are also made by the same developer using the same version of Xcode and Interface Builder too. In this example commit where this data was taken, the document tag is codeltdocument typecom.apple.InterfaceBuilder3.CocoaTouch.Storyboard.XIB version3.0 toolsVersion6250 systemVersion14A389 targetRuntimeiOS.CocoaTouch.iPad propertyAccessControlnone initialViewControllerJADvjVfCgtcode in both versions of the storyboard file for example.p  pOther than being sure to check not to commit insignificant or unintended changes to storyboard files, Id like to narrow down what is causing these unwanted changes to our storyboard views. If its something we can avoid doing that is causing the issue, we can be aware of the cause.p  pstrongUpdatestrong As Tim helpfully noted, this issue does seem to be caused while using Interface Builder on a retina display. All the developers that have caused the problem have retina MacBook Pros. Those of us without retina displays have not experienced the issue.p

Negative 66383 pI am basically following up on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17972945coredumpnotesectioncore dump note sectiona. I didnt post that question but I am trying to do the same thing write a program to create core dump file from scratch except that I am trying to do that for a custom, single threaded firmware running on embedded ARM processor.p  pI am also referring to Google a hrefhttpcode.google.compgooglecoredumper relnofollowcoredumpera source to understand how corefiles are usually created. So far I have successfully created a core file with a PTNOTE and a PTLOAD program headers which is read by GDB.p  pNote that, I am trying to create this core file for a custom firmware and this is not Linux environment. My question is regarding PTLOAD program headers. From what I understood, I just need to create as many PTLOAD program headers as active threads for which core needs to be created with headers representing each threads memory mappings. Since my firmware is single threaded, I created only one PTLOAD program header with memory mapping being address values on stack.p  pWhen I load up ELF image of the firmware with this newly created core file, GDB prints registers accurately with info reg. GDB also identifies PC program counter value and displays the symbol accurately.  It, however, cannot display remaining frames from stack bt doesnt work. It complains that it Cannot access memory at address SP4.p  pIve already provided firmwares stack mappings in the core file and GDB should have been able to read at address SP4. Note that, I can examine the value at SP4 with x 0xSP4.p  pCan anyone tell me what am I missing herep  pThanksp

Negative 66383 pIm looking for the fastest way to create formules inside a web page.p  pI thought I found the solution on a hrefhttpjsperf.comkatexvsmathjax9 relnofollowjsperfa in which MathQuill is by far the quickest. After I studied the tests a bit I noticed that the test for MathQuill runs in syncmode, but it had an async setup. However, if you check the async checkbox, MathQuill will never fire the coderendercode event and thus the test will never complete.p  pSo the questions is, is MathQuill async  And is this is good performance test  And is there maybe a better formula renderer p

Negative 66383 pI am writing a service which serves stateless incoming requests. The requests are all mathematical calculation, which does not take very long to execute  max 2ms. p  pI use Tibco EMS to communicate between clientserver. A client library is provided which wraps the client side logic e.g. convert data into EMS message etc and send the request to a request queue. The server side processes the request and send the response into a separate queue. This works fine.p  pThe server side is multithreaded. A new thread is created when a new incoming request is received. Requests are therefore handled concurrently.p  pThe server side uses one single EMS connection to the EMS server. However, because EMS Session is not thread safe, if I want to be able to write the response to EMS queue in each thread, I have to create one session for each thread using the connectionFactory. This degraded the performance. p  pThe time spent on traffic is around 34ms, i.e. Time between a request is sent and a response is received is around 56ms.34ms for transportation, marshalunmarshal, 2ms for calculation.p  pIs there any solution which allows me to concurrently send to a EMS queue without creating two much JMS objects p  pAre there any other important rules I need to follow to further optimize the service Some basic optimization guidelines are already followedp  ol liUse CachedConnectionPoolli liSend JMS message as NONPERSISTANTli liUse one EMS connection for all requests.li ol  pThank you very much.p

Negative 66383 pThis is a much talked about subject, particularly of late.  Hopefully this isnt a dupe as Ive gone over all the other SO questions.  p  pIm not interested in whether this is legal or not.  Whilst its not 100 clear whether you can freely do what you want with a dylib on iOS8, it appears some amount of dynamic loading is allowed see for example a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4733847canyoubuilddynamiclibrariesforiosandloadthematruntimeCan you build dynamic libraries for iOS and load them at runtimea.p  pWhat I care about is just making dlopen work forget store submissions for now  Ive got a very basic iOS example where I manually do a dlopen followed by a dlsym to call a function in a homegrown dylib.  This works fine on the simulator but fails on device.  The device is an iPhone 4s running nonjailbroken iOS 7.1.2.p  pAFAIK it is legal to call dlopen even on iOS 7 as there are explicit Apple instructions for how to support this see Deploying a Containing App to Older Versions of iOS here a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryprereleaseiosdocumentationGeneralConceptualExtensibilityPGExtensionScenarios.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40014214CH21SW3 relnofollowhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryprereleaseiosdocumentationGeneralConceptualExtensibilityPGExtensionScenarios.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40014214CH21SW3a. p  pMy guess is the root cause is something simple, like the dylib being in a folder which iOS doesnt like for binaries.  Does anyone have any experience doing this and know what the restrictions are, or possibly knows what Im doing wrong.p  pFYI my load code isp  precodeNSString resourcePath  [[NSBundle mainBundle] resourcePath] NSString dlPath  [NSString stringWithFormat frameworktest, resourcePath] const char cdlpath  [dlPath UTF8String] void hModule  dlopencdlpath, RTLDLAZY codepre  pThe dylib frameworktest was created by creating a Cocoa Touch Framework, building and grabbing the dylib binary from the built framework and adding to the project resources in the root folder.  otool shows the dylib as an armv7 dynmic library targeting ios min version of 7.0.  I can successfully fopen the file as well so I know Im looking in the right folder.p  pI can step deep into the dlopen assembly. So far in fact that it became uninformative looking for obvious fails p  pAny ideasp

Negative 66383 pRight now im looking to code a program that can do basic linear algebra from, Where i have 2 constants A and B, where i can simply input their coefficients and add other values onto it.p  pExample p  pSay i wanted to find the terms of the fibbonaci sequencep  precodeA B codepre  pI want to take A  B and append it to file.p  precodeA B AB codepre  pNow i want to add the 2nd and 3rd termp  precodeA B A  B A  2B codepre  pAnd so on.p  pI have a program that can do this for all numerical values just fine, however, i would like to see it go up algebraicly, Without using binets formula.p  pMy only guess is to store the coefficents of A and B to 2 seperate files in order to calculate them and then print them out, however, If linear algebra is available in C it would be much easier.p  pEdit Never mind, i forgot that this is a place for computer nerds, not math nerdsp

Negative 66383 pI have a very specific problem. Im creating a word list app that basically lets me enter some words and their meanings and stores them in an SQLite database and then it shows them back to me. Ive made my own content provider to handle all these interactions. I store the words in one table and the definitions in another table and these two tables are linked together through the books unique id. Im also using a CursorLoader and a CursorAdapter to populate my listView in my MainActivity. Now my problem is when I get the list of the words that I have in my database, some of the words have more than one definition and I have to query against the database as Im drawing each list item in my listView to find the definitions and put them on the list. This has caused my listView to stutter. Ive even tried to use AsyncTask but I dont want to start a new thread every time a word is getting added to my listView at runtime. Is there any efficient, right way to do thisp  pThis is my CursorAdapter class where I believe is the source of the problem.p  precodepublic class WordAdapter extends CursorAdapter   public static

Negative 66383 pI am still a wobbly young colt in the Automated Test Script world, so bear with me. I know enough to write simple scripts to fill out web forms or test if basic page elements exist in Watir or Selenium. I also have basic OOP skills in a couple different languagesjust have to look up syntax on google but the ideology is there.p  pAt any rate, lets say I have a website that has a few ad iframes that multiple ad feeds that are daisy chained together can fill onif my top paying feed doesnt fill, it passes it on to the next in line. I have an ad feed that rarely fills, I want to write a script that will, at minimum, tell me if that ad feed fills at all  like a TrueFalse PassFail kind of deal.p  pWhat should I look forsearch for I am not really sure what to ask so it is hard to find stuff to read up on. I imagine I would go into the iframebrowser.iframe but after that I am not sure how to sniff web traffic. Typically in my manual testing I open debugger and look under the resources to see the ad chain, or look in the network tab to see if there was a call made in the first place. All I am missing is that gap between finding the iframe on the page and seeing what is filling it.p

Negative 66383 pIm running an R script that grabs a query from MySQL. The query itself is functional, but is dependent on a variable N.p  pTo add this variable to my SQL code, Im using sprintf to insert it by typing s where Id like it. However, my query also includes multiple of these LIKE statementsp  blockquote   pFROM codeReceiptscodep      pWHERE codeRetailerIDcodep      pIN  s   this is where N is placedp      pAND  codeDatecode LIKE  01072014p blockquote  pIm positive that this is the reason my query is not running. The sprintf command is having issue when it reaches these LIKE commands, probably thinking it is similar to s. p  pDoes anyone know how to get around this so that 01072014 is still printed to the SQL query Ive tried using the escape  like this, 01072014 but it still doesnt work.p  pIs there a way I can format sprintf so it knows to skip thesep  pThanksp
Negative 66383 pWhen I prepare a statement with bindValue the placeholder mark is not replaced if it is surrounded with single quotes. This is problematic since in SQL strings are surrounded by single quotes to avoid keyword conflicts. See my attachements with screenies of the content of the database once inserted with and once without single quotes. I already reported a a hrefhttpsbugreports.qt.iobrowseQTBUG45915 relnofollowbuga, but meanwhile I am not sure anymore if this is not just an encoding problem. Is it correct to use single quotes, i.e. should this work is this really a bugp  pWith quoutes img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0OPBF.png altenter image description here Without quoutes img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comCn00c.png altenter image description herep

Negative 66383 pThis is a repost of my question in the a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicrythmenginePCU2dKKlzy4 relnofollowGoogle Groupa. Hopefully I will get some response here.p  pFrequently I run into this problem. I want to generate a line of text if the text is not empty. If it is empty, do not generate the line. Illustration templatep  pre namespace classSpec.getNamespace  classSpec.getComment class classSpec.getName    ...  pre  pIf classSpec.getComment returns meaningful comment text, the result looks likep  pre namespace com.example   this is comment class MyClass    ...  pre  pBut if there is no comment, it will bep  pre namespace com.example   class MyClass    ...  pre  pNotice the extra empty line I do not want it. Currently the solution is to write template asp  pre namespace classSpec.getNamespace  classSpec.getCommentclass classSpec.getName    ...  pre  pand make sure the getComment will append a n to the return value. This makes the template much less readable. Also, imagine I need to generate a function with multiple parameters in a for loop. If each parameter requires complex logic of template code, I need to make them all written in one line as above. Otherwise, the result file will have function likep  pre function myFunction   String stringParam,   Integer intParam,   Long longParam  pre  pstrongThe core problem isstrong, the template file does not only contain scripts, but also raw text to be written in the output. For script part, we want newlines and indentations. We want the space to be trimmed just like what compilers usually do. But for raw text, we want the spaces to be exact as specified in the file. I feel we need a bit more raw text control mechanism to reconcile the two parts.p  pSpecific to this case, is there some special symbol to treat multiple lines as single line in the output For example, like if we can writep  pre namespace classSpec.getNamespace  classSpec.getComment class classSpec.getName    ...  pre  pThanksp

Score  [2310]  [556] 31li li[1,2,5], [7,9,10]. Score  [237]  [556] 28.  And the score is maximum in match 1 so it is the required answer.li ol  pWe didnt consider the occurrence [1,2,8] or [1,2,10] as they are not in the given window as 81  5.p  pSo, I would like to know if there is some solution to find the set of occurrences or match that gives the maximum score efficiently.p

Negative 66383 pIm trying to implement chat for my webapp with following featuresp  ul liWhen user logs in he should see a number of unread messages which is both offline messages and unseen, I will explain unseen in next step.li liWhen user is anywhere in the app but on chat window he should be notified that he has a new message. Message should be marked unseen and must be added to the count of unread messages.li ul  pThe first point is quite easily achieved using XEP0013 Flexible Offline Message Retrieval. So I can retrieve offline messages and when Im sure user has seen them  I remove them from unread list. But the problem is how do I achieve same thing for unseen messages p  pIn short what I need is any message should be marked as offline, unless user sees it and its removed from the list by explicit request.p  pCan I achieve that with XMPP and how do I do thatp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 66383 pI do not know exactly why the cdf has different values when I change the bandwidth in the kernel density estimation. In the code below, I generate random numbers from a gaussian distribution and estimate the kernel density of the data in selecting different bandwidths h. When I integrate the pdf I get different values more or less distant from 1. So, it seems that the CDF depends on the bandwidth used in the kernel density estimation. Yet, I beleived that the factor 1nh in kernel desnity estimation ensures that the pdf integrates to 1. if the bandwidth is the issue, how can I determine it to ensure that the resulting pdf integrates to 1p  precodeglt1 nlt1000 set.seedg df lt data.framexsortrnormn,0,1   libraryfunctional  gaussianKernel lt functionu expu222pi.5  densityFunction lt functionx, df, ker, h     difference  ttdf  xh     W  sumapplydifference, 1, ker  nrowdfh   myDensityFunction lt CurrydensityFunction, dfdf, kergaussianKernel, h2  vectltvector for i in 1lengthdfx fltmyDensityFunctiondfx[i] vectltcvect,f   f lt approxfundfx, vect, yleft  0, yright  0 integratef, Inf, Inf codepre

If you change that variable to en, fr or de others work as well, but the website will be made for those languages you can see the FullCalendar changing the language. Only the todaybutton stays in English. The languagevariable from the URL will be given to the FullCalendar code automatically. As long as the rest of the FullCalendar is changing the language the variable from the URL is passed correctly.p  pI even tried to take the full moment.js code with all languages from the momentjs.com homepage and paste it in the moment.js file in the FullCalendar lib directory.

Negative 66383 pI have a Universal app, Xcode 7 Beta, targeting iOS 8. p  pI am presenting a View Controller using codeUIPopoverPresentationControllercode.p  pWhen presented in any Regular Size Class e.g. Full screen iPad in any orientation, the View Controller appears as a popover, at the size I have set in the codepreferredContentSizecode property. A tap outside the bounds of the View Controller will dismiss the popover.p  pWhen presented in Compact Width Size Class e.g. any iPhone in portrait orientation, the popover will become a full screen view, sliding in from the bottom to the top.p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pWhile an iPad popover has builtin dismissal behaviour i.e. tap outside of the popover, popovers presented fullscreen do not. And thus need some UI in order to provide the user with a way to dismiss the popover.p  pstrongQuestionstrong p  pWhat is the best recommended way to present a UI such that it only appears for the Compact Width Size Class, in order to give the user an option to dismiss the full screen popover View Controllerp  pstrongDiscussionstrongp  pOne approach I have seen is to embed the [View Controller to be presented] in a codeUINavigationControllercode. A bar button is added to the Navigation Bar, though whose outlet we can tell the presenting View Controller to dismiss the presentation.p  pHowever, not only does this require an extra, unwanted hierarchy for the otherwise simple presented View Controller on the iPad, but it requires environment checking idiom size class in codeviewDidLoadcode to programmatically hide the codeNavigationBarcode if a Regular Width Size Class e.g. iPad is being used. This strikes me as... fragile.p  pAnother option is to do the above, but use Size Classes within Interface Builder to emInstallUninstallem the Navigation elements, nonprogrammatically.p  pThoughtsp  pRelated link, a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions26687017ios8presentationcontrollerdetermineifreallyispopover2703792827037928discussing the detection of popover modeap

Negative 66383 pI am creating a web page that contains lots of transitions and animations. I dont like it when things zap from one place to another, I like it to slide over instead. Which is why I have a problem with responsive web apps. Yes, the elements of the page will reposition themselves correctly when you resize the window, but they dont animate, instead they go from point A to point B in, quite literally, no time.p  pIs there any way I can solve this problem I am open to any CSS or JS solutions. For an example, go a hrefhttpsgoo.glpr8X4y relnofollowherea, make your browser window smaller, and click on the hamburger menu icon in the top left. The buttons in the main section of the page reposition themselves but again, no animation. It makes me sad.p

Negative 66383 pI want to draw an UML diagram of the following class hierarchy. It is already kind of UMLish. However, I am not sure how to represent the fact, that codeUILListcode is derived from codeListBasecode, which can be either of type codeDLListBasecode or codeSLListBasecode.p  pcodeUILListcode and codeILListcode are not abstract classes as they have no pure virtual functions, however, only codeIDLListcode and codeISLListcode are concrete types.p  pcodeDLListBasecode and codeSLListBasecode are concrete classes which have no base class.p  hr  pI drew the box around codeListBasecode being the base class for codeUILListcode as a first shot to highlight the fact, that codeListBasecode is not a real class. p  pI considered dropping the dashed codeListBasecode box alltogether, however, drawing the lines denoting the inheritance from codeDLListBasecode AND codeSLListBasecode to codeUILListcode looks too much like multiple inheritance.p  hr  pFYI this is the class hierarchy that implements singly and doublylinked lists, both traditional and intrusive.

Negative 66383 pIm working within a team to try and create a single page checkout for a bespoke multistore ecommerce platform. Using responsive design, wed like our checkout to display as a single page at desktop size and display in an accordion style on mobile sized displays.p  pWe have 4 panels for data inputdisplayp  ul liAddress Details  7 text formfields and a listbox selectorli liShipping Method  2 radio buttonsli liPayment Method  listbox selector with optional formfield inputs depending on the list option selectedli liReview and Confirm  Basket summary with totals updated on the fly using Ajax as the data in the input panels is changed, plus submit buttonli ul  pAt desktop size, these 4 panels will display in 4 columns side by side so the user can see all options on one page. At mobile size we can get these panels to reflow into a single very long page, but we would prefer to collapse the panels so that only one stage of the checkout is visible at a time. The panel headers will remain shown at the head of each accordion level, above or below the content of the current stage depending where the user is up to. Tapping a collapsed header should expand that panel and collapse the currently opened one so that only one panel is in view at a time.p  pOn researching, I cant locate any live examples where this functionality has been used in responsive design. Our lead designer tells us that the inputs for each display version would have to be stored in two separate data sets and synced on each change using Javascript. We want to avoid the page becoming overloaded with excess code so were looking for a way to display the same inputoutput panels shown on the desktop version as accordion panels with accordion behaviour when the responsive site is sized past a mobile break point.p  pThinking about this mobile first, we believe the answer may lie in creating the accordion first and then somehow coding this to remove the accordion styling functionality at desktop size so the sections of the accordion can be manipulated to display side by side.p  pAll answers gratefully received.p
Negative 66383 pIm deciding whether I want to use JWTs.  On paper they look really good because they dont require storage mechanisms for the majority of use cases to verify whether a session is valid and authenticated.p  pHowever, Im building an application w PHP that acts as an intermediary between users and a separate proprietary database which has its own set of permissions and users.  Essentially its a replacement frontend for a proprietary DB.p  pThe users of my own application are essentially just passing credentials and requests for data through to the DB.  Then my application retrieves and sends the data from the DB to the users.p  pIn my case, I need to keep track of the users my own application and map their sessionskeys to the ones opened on their behalf to the remote DB server.  p  pIf I use sessions, then I can just track that in the session file on the server.br If I use JWT, I still need to store the token to retrieve the session key for the DB server.p  pA couple of notesp  ul liThe application does not need to scale much as its B2B.li liHTTPS is used in both directions client to server, server to server in all casesli liUsers have their own usernamespassword credentials on the DB server.li liI do not want to send the DB session key back to the client inside the payload.li ul  pShould I stick with JWT  Or should I just keep using sessionsp

Negative 66383 pIm using IntelliJ Idea Ultimate 14.1.4p  pIm following a tutorial about TDD on android, one of the steps is to create an independent nonandroid java module, I tried to do that but it has no build.gradle file.

Negative 66383 pSince I am refactoring my code right now, I am trying to first sort out possible code duplicates. As a posible duplicate I see the 2 methods which basically read files One from FTP and another from local filestructures. The problem is, that they of course use different classes to achieve the same things. The variable directoryListing is the tricky one.p  precodereadLogsboolean useFTP  directory Listing of course needs to be of a different type here or not being declared at all      File[] directoryListing     File dir  Settings.getInputfolder     ifuseFTP              ftp implementation             client  new FTPClient                            client.connectSettings.getFtpHost             client.enterLocalPassiveMode             client.loginSettings.getFtpLoginname, Settings.getFtpPassword             client.setFileTypeFTPClient.BINARYFILETYPE              directoryListing should be of type FTPFile[] here             directoryListing  client.listFilesSettings.getInputfolder.toString     else         directoryListing should be of type File[] in this case         directoryListing  dir.listFiles          if directoryListing  null              log.errorInputfolder not found  dir.getAbsolutePath          I want to be able to iterate  here myFolder might be of type File oder FTPFile     for Object myFolder  directoryListing      ...     ...       codepre  pThe only methods I am using later on in the code have the exact same signatures on both File and FTPFilebr     getNamebr     isFilebr     isDirectorybr     listFilesbr I have used reflections for those e.g. p  precodeMethod getFolderNameMethod  myFolder.getClass.getMethodgetName String name  String getFolderNameMethod.invokemyFolder codepre  pIn what way can I achieve a somewhat dynamic declaration of the directoryListing variable p  pThank you very much for your time and advice in advance Dp

I was reading that in my case codetestsattributescode should be within codeweekattributescode, since the Test Im trying to modify embelongsem to Week. like thisp  precodedef eventparams   params.requireevent.permitname, start, end, place,      weeksattributes [id, start, end, destroy, testattributes [id, name, date, time, weekid]] end codepre  pI do not know how to make the form to follow this association or if this is actually a solution.

Negative 66383 pI have a problem, it am totally stuck on what to do.
