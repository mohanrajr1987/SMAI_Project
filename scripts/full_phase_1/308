Positive 308 pIn other word, is there any GPU that does not support OpenGL, and instead support other graphic rendering libraries like DirectX, OpenCl.p
Positive 308 pI have the directx sdk from june 2010 installed but I still get this error Could anyone help me I am using visual studio 2012. Ive tried to reinstall it, include the whole directx sdk in my project but Im still seeing the same error Please help me out as Id like to know how to fix this as its making me behind on a current project that Im working on, so if anyone can help me out here Id be extremely appreciative.p
Positive 308 pIm going to run the DirectX application on a host machine without actually showing output on the screen. Am i able to connect another monitor and launch game on it, while my default monitor shows different stuffp  pI think it could be possible to emulate a monitor, so its enough to read front buffer using GDI or DirectX to get raw gpus output. Am I right If so, can you tell me how I may implement this, pleasep
Positive 308 pIm using C and DirectD3D9 to draw a menu. I wish to navigate the menu with the mouse. I can get the mouse position, however, checking if the left button is clicked is proving tricky. I am able to check if it is being held down, but not clicked.p  precodebool LBUTTONDOWN  false LRESULT CALLBACK LowLevelMouseProcint nCode, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam      if nCode  HCACTION ampamp wParam  WMLBUTTONUP  wParam  WMLBUTTONDOWN          LBUTTONDOWN  wParam  WMLBUTTONDOWN          return CallNextHookEx0, nCode, wParam, lParam  codepre  pHow can I add a check to see if I clicked the left buttonp
Positive 308 pThe question wasnt formulated exactly right because its a bit difficult to do in 1 sentence, so the real question is The function which creates the object representing a device in Direct3D9 looks like this. p  precode  HRESULT IDirect3D9CreateDevice     UINT Adapter,     D3DDEVTYPE DeviceType,     HWND hFocusWindow,     DWORD BehaviorFlags,     D3DPRESENTPARAMETERS pPresentationParameters,     IDirect3DDevice9 ppReturnedDeviceInterface      codepre  pcodeAdaptercode UINT argument refers to a particular video card used on target computer but codeDeviceTypecode argument refers to either emHALem or emREFem. So whats the point of specifying some particular video card e.g. 0 and emREFem device type  Isnt emREFem some abstract instance which is emulated by processor and doesnt have any relation to video card  p
Positive 308 pIm having a little bit of a problem with integrating CEF3 into my application. Currently Im using a texture in default pool with dynamic usage but Im getting only 10FPS in the browser.

Positive 308 pIve been fighting a memory leak in my software, where the virtual address space of my application is slowly used up by shared memory.

In this sample, running on my NVIDIA GeForce 780 Ti on Windows 8.1, my 32bit process very quickly runs out of VAS as these textures do not appear to get freed.p  pAm I misunderstanding an API, is there a bug in DirectX, or is there a bug in my GPU driver  Any suggestions on fixing this, or who to contact, are greatly appreciated.p  precodewhile true      IDirect3DTexture9 tex  nullptr     HANDLE handle  0     hr  device9gtCreateTexture1024, 1024, 1, D3DUSAGERENDERTARGET, D3DFMTA16B16G16R16F, D3DPOOLDEFAULT, amptex, amphandle     VERIFYSUCCEEDEDhr      ID3D11Texture2D tex11     hr  device11gtOpenSharedResourcehandle, uuidofID3D11Texture2D, voidamptex11     VERIFYSUCCEEDEDhr      tex11gtRelease     texgtRelease      Sleep10  codepre  pIf I comment out the OpenSharedResource section there is no leak.

Positive 308 pIm fairly new to DirectX. I have what I think should be a pretty simple question, but I cant seem to find an answer to it anywhere.p  pBasically, Id like to know how to add vertices from multiple meshes to a single vertex buffer. This would only happen once per mesh as the program is initialized, so I believe I want DEFAULT usage. p  pIs It possible to add each mesh to the buffer individually or do I need to collect them all in a single array and pass them all at once Default or Dynamic MapUnmap or updateSubresource Thanksp  pFor now I am using an index buffer and drawing once per object horrible I know but I am planning on switching to instancing as soon as I figure this out.p

Positive 308 pIve developed games using the SFML C library for windows desktop, but I want to get into universal app development. Im new to DirectX, I guess I want to learn about the Direct2D library for universal development. But since this universal stuff is new, there isnt much insight on how to get started. I know how to read Microsofts documentation, but I assume most of it is based on nonuniversal development. I need a good tutorial on how to get me started with a basic emHello Worldem app with Microsofts universal DirectX libraries, and then I can progress myself from there. p

Positive 308 pIm attempting to make a video game in Unreal Engine 4.9. Im building it for Windows, but Id like to have it use opengl instead of directx in the executable.

Positive 308 pI am learning DirectCompute and I am stuck with StructuredBufferes. The thing is I learned that to supply data to shader I need to use a View  SRV or UAV, depending on what I am trying to achieve. But code examples from Microsoft site do not explain, how does a view defined in C code correspond to a specific Buffer defined in shader code. However, there is a hlsl keyword I dont really understand  coderegistercode. In sample there were three bufferesp  precode    StructuredBufferltBuffTypegt Buff0  registert0     StructuredBufferltBuffTypegt Buff1  registert1     RWStructuredBufferltBuffTypegt BuffOut  registeru0 codepre  pIn C code the authors just set ComputeShader, 1 UAV, 2 SRVs and then call Context.Dispatch,, assuming they have prepared all buffers and views before. So the question is  how do I understand that the particular SRV there are two of them provide data for the particaular StructuredBuffer Is it controlled by register numbere.g. registert0 is filled first, registert1  second. If yes, what if I want to provide data to second buffer first, and then fill the first one I feel myself that I miss something very important, but in previous tutorials I used everything was a lot easier because of EffectVariales and em.GetVariableByem methods. Thanks in advance.p

Positive 308 pI did a bit of searching, but the only results I found regarded antialiasing and the mechanics behind it.p  pI want to use a multisample buffer for things other than antialiasing.  Specifically, what I have in mind is a form of orderindependent transparency, storing a different color and depth value in each sample ideally the N fragments closest to the camera.p  pIs this even possible in the first place  Has it been done before, and if so how  Even if it were possible, is it any more memoryefficient than just allocating another N framebuffersp  pIf something like this would require a compute shader or OpenCL, thats fine, Im just curious to see if its possible in the first place.p  pThis question isnt specific to OpenGL or DirectX, since the hardware would be the same in either case.p  pPS. Please dont just point me towards other methods of orderindependent transparency, this question is specifically about whether the multisample buffer can be used for atypical means.p
Positive 308 pIm emcompletelyem new to DirectX 11 so this question will be extremely basic. Sorry about that.p  pId like to draw a cube on screen that has solidcoloured faces. All of the examples that Ive seen have 8 vertices, with a colour defined at each vertex red, green, blue. The pixel shader then interpolates between these vertices to give a spectrum of colours. This looks nice, but isnt what Im trying to achieve. Id just like a cube with six, coloured faces.p  pTwo ideas come to mindp  ol liuse 24 vertices, and have each vertex referenced only a single time, i.e. no sharing. This way I can define three different colours at each 3D position, one for each face.li liuse a texture for each face that stretches to give the face the correct colour. Im not very familiar with textures right now, so not all that sure about this idea.li ol  pstrongWhats the typicalcanonical way to achieve this effectstrong Im sure this problem has been solved many, many times before.p

I read this could be caused by having your depth amp stencil view bound by codeD3D11DeviceContextOMSetRenderTargetscode at the time you want to sample the depth buffer. I fixed that, but the buffer is still black. I checked the graphics debugger, with no success. So, is my depth buffer not getting written correctly, or am I sampling the wrong way firstPS works fine.p  p2 Speaking of sampling, the book Im using just says well be using a point sampler, but I have no idea what is exactly meant. Now Im just using a standard texture map sampler, but is there something else I should sample withp  p3 Also, the book uses the codeSamplerState.Gathercode function in secondPS, but when I tried that it complained that the expression could not be mapped to pixel shader instruction set. Is codeGathercode an error in the book, or is it my GPU D3D feature level 11.0 who doesnt understand what that is Is codeSamplecode good enough for what I want to do The original use of codeGathercode was in the context of creating a silhouette around objects in the depth buffer.p  p4 I tried to get secondVS to draw nothing but a fullscreen quad, but FXC complained about my use of codeSVVertexIDcode as invalid, saying that my type should be integral, even though it already was. I read somewhere that codeSVVertexIDcode can only be used by the first VS in a pipeline. Is that the problem here How do I solve this in this particular case In my current inefficient solution, is the problem being caused by the UVsp

Negative 308 pDisclaimer As it says in the title, this is targeted at Internet Explorer bonlyb. Thats a perk of doing internal development  it makes life a little easier when dealing with stuff like this.p  pDisclaimer 2 I can reproduce this in IE7 and IE6. I have not tried IE8, as this is not available for us in our corporate environment.p  pMy goal is to create a table where the content scrolls while keeping the THEAD fixed. There are a lot of different ways one can accomplish this you can see my approach at the bottom of this post. Unfortunately, I dont have a place to publicly host this example, but you can copy and paste it here to test it out  a hrefhttpwww.w3schools.comjsreftryit.aspfilenametryjsrefparse relnofollowhttpwww.w3schools.comjsreftryit.aspfilenametryjsrefparseap  pSo if you scroll the table down, and the hover the mouse over the first cell in the table, youll see the phenomena Im talking about the header row jumps up p  pHeres where it gets fun. The table is being rendered by a thirdparty ASP.NET control. So I cant alter the HTML that is getting emitted only the CSS. Using the IE7 developers toolbar, I can tell that the class of the control is changing as I mouse over it a new class is being added to it. Oddly enough, the toolbar does inoti show any onmouseover or onmouseleave events on the header, just something it calls events and control, which are both [Object]. The source doesnt reveal anything useful either.p  pSo my goal is to prevent this header row jump using only CSS. Is this even possible And if its possible, can it be done without CSS expressions which Im desperately trying to avoidp  pHere is the sample HTML which emulates what Im seeing.p  pPaste here to test a hrefhttpwww.w3schools.comjsreftryit.aspfilenametryjsrefparse relnofollowhttpwww.w3schools.comjsreftryit.aspfilenametryjsrefparseap  pre ltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt ltstyle typetextcssgt .ScrollContainer      overflowy auto important     overflowx hidden important     margin 0 auto     width 100 important     maxheight 275px     borderbottom solid 1px 009DD9   .ScrollContainer .MasterTable      width auto important   .ScrollContainer table      tablelayout fixed   .ScrollContainer .GridHeader      positionrelative     top 0px     bordertop solid 1px 009DD9     borderright solid 1px 009DD9     borderbottom solid 1px 009DD9     borderleft solid 1px 009DD9     background cccccc   Spacer      height 350px   .GridHeader      height 30px important   ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdiv idSpacergtltdivgt ltdiv classScrollContainergt ltdiv classDummygt ltdiv classGridgt lttable classMasterTablegt ltcolgroupgt ltcolgtltcolgtltcolgtltcolgtltcolgtltcolgt ltcolgroupgt lttheadgtlttrgt ltth classGridHeader onMouseEnterthis.className  this.className   GridOver onMouseLeavethis.className  this.className.replace GridOver,  gtlta href styleGridLinkgtColumn 1ltagtltthgt ltth classGridHeadergtlta href styleGridLinkgtColumn 2ltagtltthgt ltth classGridHeadergtlta href styleGridLinkgtColumn 3ltagtltthgt ltth classGridHeadergtlta href styleGridLinkgtColumn 4ltagtltthgt ltth classGridHeadergtlta href styleGridLinkgtColumn 5ltagtltthgt ltth classGridHeadergtlta href styleGridLinkgtColumn 6ltagtltthgtlttrgt lttheadgt lttbodygt lttrgtlttdgtAlttdgtlttdgtBlttdgtlttdgtXlttdgtlttdgtDlttdgtlttdgtElttdgtlttdgtFlttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgtAlttdgtlttdgtBlttdgtlttdgtXlttdgtlttdgtDlttdgtlttdgtElttdgtlttdgtFlttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgtAlttdgtlttdgtBlttdgtlttdgtXlttdgtlttdgtDlttdgtlttdgtElttdgtlttdgtFlttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgtAlttdgtlttdgtBlttdgtlttdgtXlttdgtlttdgtDlttdgtlttdgtElttdgtlttdgtFlttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgtAlttdgtlttdgtBlttdgtlttdgtXlttdgtlttdgtDlttdgtlttdgtElttdgtlttdgtFlttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgtAlttdgtlttdgtBlttdgtlttdgtXlttdgtlttdgtDlttdgtlttdgtElttdgtlttdgtFlttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgtAlttdgtlttdgtBlttdgtlttdgtXlttdgtlttdgtDlttdgtlttdgtElttdgtlttdgtFlttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgtAlttdgtlttdgtBlttdgtlttdgtXlttdgtlttdgtDlttdgtlttdgtElttdgtlttdgtFlttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgtAlttdgtlttdgtBlttdgtlttdgtXlttdgtlttdgtDlttdgtlttdgtElttdgtlttdgtFlttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgtAlttdgtlttdgtBlttdgtlttdgtXlttdgtlttdgtDlttdgtlttdgtElttdgtlttdgtFlttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgtAlttdgtlttdgtBlttdgtlttdgtXlttdgtlttdgtDlttdgtlttdgtElttdgtlttdgtFlttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgtAlttdgtlttdgtBlttdgtlttdgtXlttdgtlttdgtDlttdgtlttdgtElttdgtlttdgtFlttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgtAlttdgtlttdgtBlttdgtlttdgtXlttdgtlttdgtDlttdgtlttdgtElttdgtlttdgtFlttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgtAlttdgtlttdgtBlttdgtlttdgtXlttdgtlttdgtDlttdgtlttdgtElttdgtlttdgtFlttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgtAlttdgtlttdgtBlttdgtlttdgtXlttdgtlttdgtDlttdgtlttdgtElttdgtlttdgtFlttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgtAlttdgtlttdgtBlttdgtlttdgtXlttdgtlttdgtDlttdgtlttdgtElttdgtlttdgtFlttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgtAlttdgtlttdgtBlttdgtlttdgtXlttdgtlttdgtDlttdgtlttdgtElttdgtlttdgtFlttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgtAlttdgtlttdgtBlttdgtlttdgtXlttdgtlttdgtDlttdgtlttdgtElttdgtlttdgtFlttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgtAlttdgtlttdgtBlttdgtlttdgtXlttdgtlttdgtDlttdgtlttdgtElttdgtlttdgtFlttdgtlttrgt lttrgtlttdgtAlttdgtlttdgtBlttdgtlttdgtXlttdgtlttdgtDlttdgtlttdgtElttdgtlttdgtFlttdgtlttrgt lttbodygt lttablegt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgtpre

Its understandable since we are using Quartz.net to make some application recicling, but we could not reproduce the problem yet.p  pHere is a trace made with JetBrains dotTrace 3.1 while the CPU was high a hrefhttpmycenter.infotmpDotTraceSnapshot.ziphttpmycenter.infotmpDotTraceSnapshot.zipap  pUsually the process wasting CPU is the w3wp.exe, but in the last couple days sqlserver 2008 and memcached 1.2.1, and updated on Monday to 1.2.4 beta were killing the CPU too. Its weird that some times memcached starts consuming 100 and the its stats show that its quiet, however it works fine when a request is made.p  pHeres a crash dump or stack trace dump of w3wp, using WinDbg based on this guide a hrefhttpblogs.technet.commarcelofarturaarchive20060915troubleshootingiis100cpuissuesstepbystepintermediary.aspxhttpblogs.technet.commarcelofarturaarchive20060915troubleshootingiis100cpuissuesstepbystepintermediary.aspxap  precode0000gt  .  0  Id 1be4.1d3c Suspend 1 Teb 7ffdf000 Unfrozen    1  Id 1be4.b1c Suspend 1 Teb 7ffde000 Unfrozen    2  Id 1be4.12a0 Suspend 1 Teb 7ffdd000 Unfrozen    3  Id 1be4.19d0 Suspend 1 Teb 7ffdc000 Unfrozen    4  Id 1be4.1714 Suspend 1 Teb 7ffd7000 Unfrozen    5  Id 1be4.1a18 Suspend 1 Teb 7ffd6000 Unfrozen    6  Id 1be4.12ac Suspend 1 Teb 7ffd5000 Unfrozen    7  Id 1be4.dec Suspend 1 Teb 7ffd4000 Unfrozen    8  Id 1be4.1e48 Suspend 1 Teb 7ffd8000 Unfrozen    9  Id 1be4.1ca8 Suspend 1 Teb 7ffd3000 Unfrozen   10  Id 1be4.1508 Suspend 1 Teb 7ffaf000 Unfrozen   11  Id 1be4.1bc0 Suspend 1 Teb 7ffae000 Unfrozen   12  Id 1be4.1f48 Suspend 1 Teb 7ffad000 Unfrozen   13  Id 1be4.1994 Suspend 1 Teb 7ffac000 Unfrozen   14  Id 1be4.1a48 Suspend 1 Teb 7ffab000 Unfrozen   15  Id 1be4.12c8 Suspend 1 Teb 7ffa8000 Unfrozen   16  Id 1be4.e44 Suspend 1 Teb 7ffa7000 Unfrozen   17  Id 1be4.19e0 Suspend 1 Teb 7ffa6000 Unfrozen   18  Id 1be4.19b0 Suspend 1 Teb 7ffa2000 Unfrozen   19  Id 1be4.1b30 Suspend 1 Teb 7ffd9000 Unfrozen   20  Id 1be4.1bfc Suspend 1 Teb 7ffa3000 Unfrozen   21  Id 1be4.1be8 Suspend 1 Teb 7ffa1000 Unfrozen   22  Id 1be4.1a54 Suspend 1 Teb 7ffa5000 Unfrozen   23  Id 1be4.b74 Suspend 1 Teb 7ff3d000 Unfrozen   24  Id 1be4.19b4 Suspend 1 Teb 7ff3c000 Unfrozen   25  Id 1be4.1460 Suspend 1 Teb 7ffdb000 Unfrozen   26  Id 1be4.1eac Suspend 1 Teb 7ffaa000 Unfrozen   27  Id 1be4.1b90 Suspend 1 Teb 7ffa4000 Unfrozen   0023gt 23s Search address set to 77dc9a94  WARNING Unable to verify checksum for SMDiagnostics.ni.dll  WARNING Unable to verify checksum for System.Data.ni.dll  ERROR Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for Microsoft.Web.Services3.DLL  WARNING Unable to verify checksum for System.Windows.Forms.ni.dll  WARNING Unable to verify checksum for System.Web.ni.dll  WARNING Unable to verify checksum for Ademy.UI.Web.DLL  ERROR Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for AjaxControlToolkit.DLL  ERROR Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for 7zSharp.DLL  WARNING Unable to verify checksum for mscorlib.ni.dll  ERROR Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for Iesi.Collections.DLL  WARNING Unable to verify checksum for System.Design.ni.dll  WARNING Unable to verify checksum for System.Core.ni.dll  WARNING Unable to verify checksum for Ademy.Event.DLL  WARNING Unable to verify checksum for System.ServiceModel.ni.dll  ERROR Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for System.ServiceModel.ni.dll  WARNING Unable to verify checksum for AppThemeOcean.wgubmrqt.dll  WARNING Unable to verify checksum for NHibernate.Burrow.AppBlock.DLL  ERROR Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for NHibernate.Burrow.AppBlock.DLL  WARNING Unable to verify checksum for NHibernate.Caches.SysCache2.DLL  ERROR Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for NHibernate.Caches.SysCache2.DLL  WARNING Unable to verify checksum for Ademy.UI.Web.Controls.DLL  WARNING Unable to verify checksum for Microsoft.JScript.ni.dll  WARNING Unable to verify checksum for System.Web.Mobile.ni.dll  WARNING Unable to verify checksum for System.Runtime.Serialization.ni.dll            Memory access error in 23s  0023gt kb ChildEBP RetAddr  Args to Child              11c6ede4 77dc8ed4 766bc622 0000038c 00000000 ntdllKiFastSystemCallRet 11c6ede8 766bc622 0000038c 00000000 11c6ee20 ntdllNtSetEvent0xc 11c6edf8 011011ef 0000038c 7f52be6e 0fda4888 kernel32SetEvent0x10 WARNING Frame IP not in any known module.

Just wanted to note that im planning this design only for core objects, not for specific classes.p

Negative 308 pIm working on a Swing based project that will display large amounts of data using a Table component. Im trying to decide what are the best alternatives in terms of efficiency and management of the parsed data. The master table can be manipulated i.e. views of the complete data can be created, or removed,so the complete data needs to be hold in memory p  pI know these kind of problems can have many different solutions. I thought of creating a class representing one entry on the log, with properties representing each property on it. I can possible use Comparator objects to sort based on these fields, and use these objects to build a table component. This might not be a good idea if the total number of entries is in the order of 500010000 linesp  pAny suggestion on good practices to manage this kind of data and perform manipulations to it to render a graphic component are received.p  pNot many details have been provided, so Im basically looking for general ideas on how to approach the problem.p

Negative 308 pI have a requirement to create a web page that is compatible on all mobile web browsers but Im completely stuck on the design of the solution.  p  pI have been tasked with building a single web page that users complete and then at the bottom of the page, are given the option to save a draft to return at a later date and complete or mark the form as complete which finalises the process.  The form is just a standard HTML form with form elements such as text boxes, buttons and drop down lists.  There is no ajax, advanced CSS or jquery etc.  Sounds simple right p  pThe two major constraints which are making this difficult arep  p1 After the web page is loaded, the user must be able to complete the form disconnected from any internet connection and then move into an internet zone, reconnect and save the form.p  p2 On clicking certain buttons, a popup must appear and they cannot return to the parent page until they click cancel or save.p  pHow can I handle popups when for example the iphone launches them in a seperate screen p  pHow can I create a DIV popup when I cant use AJAX to get the rendered HTML, or use javascript to manipulate the DIV when it might not be supportedp  pSince the page is going to be used by mobile and desktop users Im generating the form in XML and using XSLT to transform depending on the viewing platform.  I thought I could then hold the original XML Document in a javascript global variable and any changing, deleting or adding to the form elements I could use js to update the XML Document, which would then be posted to the server on save.  But not all mobile browsers support javascript.p  pThis is my first ever mobile project so Im really stuck on this one.  Soo .... calling all IT professionals, if anyone could help me with this and point me in the right direction I would be eternally gratefulp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 308 pSo Ive got an NSSearchField hooked up directly to an NSArrayController via bindings, attached to the filterPredicate, so that without any code, the user can just type in the NSSearchField and filter the list of objects in the NSArrayController presented to him in the interface an NSCollectionView, to be specific.p  pThe NSSearchField is hooked up to provide live searching, so that the NSCollectionView is filtered instantly as the user types, not after waiting for a short period for the user to stop typing.p  pHowever, the problem is that this makes the interface really laggy.  Typing is delayed significantly, by 0.51 seconds, and it seems like the NSCollectionView is trying to animate each and every rearrangement of items for each portion of the search string that the user enters.p  pWhat Id like is for the searching to be live, but the typing in the search field to be fluid, and the results to filter as fast as possible.  Is there a way to do this via bindings, or will I need to put in some custom code that triggers the filterPredicate on a separate threadp  pNote that Ive got a custom sorting algorithm set up on the NSArrayController, and removing it seems to help a bit with the laggyness, but not completely.p

And if I run it and do thisp  precode    NSLog, myLabel.font.fontName codepre  pit prints out Helvetica.p  pUsually I wouldnt mind setting it programmatically, but the problem is that this particular class is used in several different places with different nib files to provide different layouts, so I cant have it hardcoded to always use the same font family. And subclassing it for each time it appears would be a huge pain, specially because I want to enable designers to create and change all the layout with interface builder whenever they want, and if they have to tell me what font they want every time so I can hardcode every particular case, that would be very awkward.p  pHas anyone experienced this problem before Maybe Interface Builder is limiting me to use the iPhone fonts even though the xib files target is already set to iPad, but how do I convince it that Im targeting the iPadp  pThanks in advance, filipep

Negative 308 pI have a rather large application which, on the admin frontend, takes a few seconds to load a page because of all the pageviews that it has to load into objects before displaying anything. Its a bit complex to explain how the system works, but a few of my other questions explains the system in great detail. The main difference between what they say and the current system is that the customer frontend no longer loads all the pageviews into objects when a customer first views the page  it simply adds the pageview to the database and creates an object in an unsynchronised list... to put it simply, when a customer views a page it no longer loads all the pageviews into objects but the admin frontend still does.p  pI have been working on some admin tools on the customer frontend recently, so if an administrator clicks the description of an item in the catalogue then the right hand column will display statistics and available actions for the selected item. To do this the page which gets loaded through codeactioncontainer.loadbla bla blacode into the right hand column has to loop through ALL the pageviews  this ultimately means that ALL the pageviews are loaded into objects if they havent been already. For some reason this loads really REALLY fast. The difference in speed is only like a second on my dev site, but the live site has thousands of pageviews so the difference is quite big...p  pSo my question is why is it that the admin frontend loads so slowly while using codebla.loadblacode is so fast I mean whatever method jQuery uses, cant browsers use this method too and load pages superfast Obviously not as someone wouldve done that by now  but I am interested to know just why the difference is so big... is it just my system or is there a major difference in speed between the browser getting a page and jQuery getting a page Do other people experience the same kind of differencesp  pThanks in advance,p  pRegards,p  pRichardp

Negative 308 pI need a java application that should manage a database to distribute work units to its clients. Effectively its a grid application the database is filled with input parameters for clients and all its tuples must be distributed to clients that request for. After clients send their results and the server modify the database accordingly for example marking the tuples computed.br Now lets suppose that I have a database SQLite or MySQL filled with tuples and that clients do a request for a group of input tuples I want that a group of workunits are sent exclusively to a unique client, so I need to mark them already requested by another client. If I query the db for the first for example 5 queries and meanwhile another client makes the same request in a multithreaded server architecture and without any synchronization I think there is a possibility that both clients receive the same workunits.  p  pI imagined that solutions could bebr 1 make a singlethreaded server architecture  ServerSocket.accept is called again only after the previous client request has been served, so that the server is effectively accessed by only a client at timebr 2 in a multithreaded architecture, make the query and tupleslock operations synchronized, so that I obtain a kind of atomicity effectively serializing operations over the databasebr 3 use atomic query operations to the database server or file, in the case of SQLite, but in this case I need help because I dont know how things really goes...  p  pHowever I hope that you understood my problem its very similar to setihome that distributes its workunits but the intersection over all distributed units to its multitude of clients is null theoretically. My nonfunctional needs are that the language is java and that database is SQLite or MySQL.p

Negative 308 pstrongShort storystrongp  pThe NSArrayControllers selection is being reset whenever setContent is issued. I am wondering if there is a way to turn this off.p  pOf course, this would be the only acceptable behaviour if I would let NSArrayController use its internal selectionIndexes, because then it wouldnt be able to keep track of both. However, the selectionIndexes are rewired as well, and this part goes off without a hitch. It still feels the need to reset the selection, though.p  pstrongUpdate Ugly hack solutionstrong p  pIve moved this to an answer. I would be pleased to see another more insightful answer though.p  pstrongLong storystrongp  pI have a Cocoa Documentbased Application with an inspector panel that is shared between documents modelled after the TextEdit source code that ships with xcode. Inside the Document class I have an NSMutableArray and an NSMutableIndexSet that are linked up with bindings to an NSArrayController. p  pThe inspector panel is in a separate nib file, and I have two identical NSArrayControllers, one from the main document window, and one from the inspector panel, so that both can interact with the document. This is why I do a manual binding to the selectionIndexes, so that I dont get two separate selections with the two separate NSArrayControllers.p  pThe inspector panel keeps track of which document is being inspected by ap  precodeDocument inspectedDocument codepre  pwhich is updated whenever the document is switched, or no document has focus at all. An NSObjectController is linked up to codeinspectedDocumentcode, and the NSArrayController I mentioned before is linked up to that controller.p  pNow, my problem is that when the inspector panel is in place, and the codeinspectedDocumentcode is changed, the selection indexes are reset. The problem goes away if I dont use the inspector panel, so I assume it is its NSArrayController that is issuing this reset. I dont have any controls that bind to the selection and could change it such as a table view.p  pIn the inspector panels NSArrayController, if I have Avoid Empty Selection ticked, the selection resets to the first object, otherwise it resets to no selection, so it is definitely a legitimate resetting of the selection. Actually, I dont even want the inspector panel to ever be able to change the selection, so ideally I would like to establish a readonly binding for that NSArrayControllers selection indexes.p

Negative 308 pIve written a bunch of handy Excel addins in C, and everything works great. But the one thing I havent been able to figure out is if its possible to place graphics bitmaps, shapes, whatever on a worksheet control, e.g. by appending a function to its paint event handler.p  pI dont want to actually change the document in any way, its only for temporarily highlighting things to indicate how my addins are finding and interpreting data in the sheet. The simplest thing I want to be able to do is draw a border around a specific range.p  pI could do it by creating a bunch of transparent toplevel windows that try to clip themselves to the document window, but thats really a nasty solution, and Im thinking the windows would get in the way of user input, too.p
Negative 308 pI have a form where the location fields use a dependent drop down set up, if you choose united states as your country the state dropdown will appear. The fields are populated through an ajax call when fired so its not loading every single country, state or province, and city in the world on page load lol.p  pIt all works great, however the problem Im running into is how to set the default selected value from whats already saved. It has to prepopulate those values otherwise if the member doesnt change the location fields every time he edits his profile the location fields will be blank.p  pI sort of got around the issue by simply doing a query select and then adding the value on top of the ajax pulled values, but this is a really cheesy way to doing it and doesnt work very well.p  pI need to find a way to set the selected value from the ajax results. Im sure it can be done by somehow defining the selected value in the code but Im not exactly sure on how to go about it.p

Negative 308 pIm making an application where users can save GPS data from phone to server when they travel their everyday routes. For example they are heading from home to work. GPS data is stored in a database. p  pNow, user wants to know maybe theres more people who travels this route too. I want to compare different users routes and give to user for example 35 best matches from other users routes.p  pImportant is compare the whole trip, because users can join their routes and go work together from starting at some point not just from beginning and end. Also I think important is the destination point from the users view, who is searching other users routes. Other user route must be near by the searchers route end.p  pThere are two factors  time and location. One user drives with a car and another walks and takes a bus for example. The one who walks starts his trip earlier, another later, because he travels this route faster. In one point at certain time their routes are matching.p  pHow can be routes compared Is there algorithms for that Do I need to compare every point in a routep

Negative 308 pIn a project of mine Im implementing a live radio using an endless stream. I can without any problems use the nativ Android MediaPlayer, also on devices running an old version of Android, since the stream is of type audiompeg. I have tested this on an HTC Magic running 1.6 and it works flawless. Even when switching between WLAN and 3G it just buffers up and I only notice a small hiccup and then it keeps on playing as if nothing happened. It also rarely drops connection as I have been listening in on the radio during the work day and also on the way to and from work to make sure it the user experience will be exactly like I want it to. I have repeated the same procedure for other devices like HTC Legend running Android 2.1, HTC Wildfire running 2.2 and Samsung Galaxy Tab running 2.2 with the same results. All devices handle the stream perfectly.p  pHowever, and this is where I sort of got stuck, on the HTC Desire running 2.2 I have serious problems getting the stream to play. When using the standard implementation of the MediaPlayer, that is setDataSourceString path, it plays for 10  30 seconds then it loses connection even when I have full reception on both WLAN and 3G. I have tried different methods to solve this problem one being using the a hrefhttpcode.google.compnprandroidappNPR Newsa projects a hrefhttpcode.google.compnprandroidappsourcebrowsetrunkNprsrcorgnprandroidnewsStreamProxy.javaStreamProxya which actually works pretty good after a few modifications.

It shouldnt be much differences between the software of the two devices Ive also tested this app on multiple HTC Desires to make sure it wasnt just something wrong with my test device. But on the other devices the same problems occurred just as they did on my test device.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 308 pI have a scrolling carousel of images and captions that interact separately but coordinate. Everything works great when Im on the pagetab in IE, Firefox and Chrome. In FF and Chrome, however, once I go to another tab or browser for a little bit of time, the carousel scrolls wildly proportionately to the time I was away from that page.p  pIts almost as if it keeps up with the timer but does not advance the carousel until I come back to the page and then tries to catch up to where it should be, even if that is 10 loops.p  pObviously, this is not ideal and so any help would be greatly appreciated.

I looked at an old slider script and it used a combination of duration and interval one for the time it stayed on a page and the other for the time it took to change to the next slider.

Other problem that occurs is that if I delete the command line  sethaxes,Units,normalized then, although the legend is centered, the axes appear with a reduced size.  I also have found that the first time Clegend is calles, the position of the axes variable posAx is different from the following callings in which posAx is always the same.  I have thought that when the units were changed, the position of the object was not changed but this problem arises doubts inside my mind.p

I am experimenting with various more efficient optimisation algorithms, but no matter what its going to take thousands of iterations.p  pI have parallelised a couple of the optimisers Im trying using CPU threads, which wasnt too difficult since the optimiser can easily perform several scheduled runs at once on separate threads using codeThreadPool.mapcode.p  pBut this is only about a 2x speedup on my laptop, or maybe 8x on a multicore computer.  My question is, is this an application for which I could make use of GPU processing  I have already translated some parts of the code to C, and I could imagine using OpenCL to create a function from an array of parameters to an array of error values, and running this hundreds of times at once.  Even if it performs the sequential processing part slowly, getting all the results in one shot would be amazing.p  pHowever, my guess is that the memory requirements loading up a large file and producing a temporary one of equal size to generate every data point would make it difficult to run the whole algorithm in an OpenCL kernel.

Negative 308 pIs there a good way to invalidate a Forms Authentication session from the serverp  pI understand that the cookie has an embedded expiration, but I want to do an additional check on the server to verify that the user has not manually signed out.  When a user manually signs out, I call a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.security.formsauthentication.signout.aspx relnofollowcodeFormsAuthentication.SignOutcodea which expires the cookie.  However, if I use a developer tool to set the cookie back to its original value, I am still logged in.p  pOne option I can think of would be to embed the login id into the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.security.formsauthenticationticket.userdata.aspx relnofollowcodeUserDatacodea portion of the ticket.  By this, I mean that each login is recorded in a database and there is an id associated with it.  When a user manually logs out, I could update the database record to show they have done so.  This however, would require me querying the database each time a user was authenticated not ideal.  I could maintain a cache, but it seems like that would be a lot of work and I was hoping there was an easier way p  pThanksp

Negative 308 pI have a memory leak in two apps in Tomcat 6.0.35 server that appeared out of nowhere. One app is Solr and the other is our own software. Im hoping someone has seen this before as its been happening to me for the last few weeks and I have to keep restarting Tomcat in a production environment. p  pIt appeared on our original server despite the fact that none of the code related to thread or DB connection operation has been touched. As the old server this app runs on was due to be retired I migrated the site to a new server and a cleaner environment with the idea that would clear out any legacy stuff. But it continues to happen.p  pJust before Tomcat shuts down the catalina.out log is filled with errors likep  blockquote   p20120425 214600,300 [main] ERROR org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader The web application [AppName] appears to have started a thread named [MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager cleanup] but has failed to stop it.

Also the Solr application is crashing and thats 3rd party so my thinking is that this is environmental jar conflict, versioning, config fat fingeredp  pMy last change was updating the mysql connector for java to the latest as some memory leak bugs existed around pooling in earlier releases but the servers just crashed again only a few hours later.p  pOne thing I just noticed is Im seeing thousands of sessions in the Tomcat web manager but that could be a red herring.p  pIf anyone has seen this any help is very much appreciated.p  p[Edit]p  pI think I found the source of the problem. It wasnt a memory leak after all. Ive taken over an application from another development team that uses a hrefhttpwww.mchange.comprojectsc3p0index.htmlbasicpoolconfiguration relnofollowc3p0a for database pooling via Hibernate. c3p0 has a bugfeature that if you dont release DB connections c3p0 can go into a waiting state once all the connections via MaxPoolSize default is 15 are used. It will wait indefinitely for a connection to become available. Hence my stall.p  pI upped the MaxPoolSize firstly from 25100 and my application ran for several days without a hang and then from 1001000 and its been running steady ever since over 2 weeks.p  pThis isnt the complete solution as I need to find out why its running out of pooled connections so I also set c3p0s unreturnedConnectionTimeout to 4hrs which enforces a 4hr time limit on all connections regardless of whether theyre active or not. If its an active connection it will close it and reopen again.p  pNot pretty and c3p0 dont recommend it but it gives me some breathing space to find out the source of the problem.p  pNote when using c3p0 with Hibernate the settings are stored in your persistence.xml file but not all settings can be put there. Some settings e.g. unreturnedConnectionTimeout must go in a hrefhttpwww.mchange.comprojectsc3p0index.htmlhibernatespecific relnofollowc3p0.propertiesap

Negative 308 pI would like to deliver jar files with its own a hrefhttplogback.qos.ch relnofollowlogbacka logging configuration.

Negative 308 pOn an ASP.NET MVC project we have several instances of data that requires good amount of resources and time to build.

Here is an examplep  precodevar data  cache[key] ifdata  null    data  buildDataUsingGoodAmountOfResources   cache[key]  data  codepre  pAs you can see on a busy website hundreds of threads could go inside the if statement simultaneously until the data is built and make the building operation even slower, unnecessarily consuming the server resources.p  pThere is an atomic codeAddOrGetExistingcode implementation in MemoryCache but it incorrectly requires value to set instead of code to retrieve the value to set which I think renders the given method almost completely useless. p  pWe have been using our own adhoc scaffolding around MemoryCache to get it right however it requires explicit codelockcodes. Its cumbersome to use perentry lock objects and we usually get away by sharing lock objects which is far from ideal. That made me think that reasons to avoid such convention could be intentional.p  pSo I have two questionsp  ul lipIs it a better practice not to codelockcode building code That could have been proven more responsive for one, I wonderpli lipWhats the right way to achieve perentry locking for MemoryCache for such a lock The strong urge to use codekeycode string as the lock object is dismissed at .NET locking 101. pli ul
Negative 308 pI need to model a persons database in a relational database MySQL. p  pEach person has properties. There are properties which do have only a 11 relation e.g. gender malefemale and others which do have 1n relations such as sports or language e.g. a person might play basketball and football and speak english and german . Additionaly these 1n relation have a skill level e.g. professional, beginner.p  pCurrently I am asking myself if there is a better approach than the EAV model to model the person  properties relation. My concern is primarily to make filtering for the persons having special properties easier e.g. all actors which are male and do play basketball professionally OR are beginners AND do speak english professionally. It should be possible to easily add new properties whereas this must not necessarily be completely dynamic. It is ok if this needs to be done by a developer and a table needs to be altered. But it should not be to difficult e.g. modifiying sql statements, adding joins, adding database tableslookup tables.p  pI would go for a classical column based design, having the 11 properties in the persons table in a separate column for each property. I am uncertain which is the best way to model the 1n relation in such a design. I would like to avoid to have a lookup and separate table for each 1n property. p  pThe best approach still seems to be the following EAV approachp  pA Persons table having the columns id,name e.g.p  pre 1  Christian  pre  pA Properties table having the columns personid, property, value, level, e.gp  pre 1  gender    male        1  sports    basketball  professional 1  sports    football    beginner 1  language  english     professional 1  language  german      basic pre

Negative 308 pI am currently in the process of developing a a rather big web application and is using domain driven design. p  pI have currently run into some trouble with tracking changes to my Product entity. The thing is, products are constructed partly from data in SQL Azure, partly from data in Azure Table Storage.  If certain properties are changed, I will need to persist to both, other changes only to one.p  pAs a result I can not use NHibernate or Entity Framework for tracking changes. For instance the Price argument on thep  precode    public void AddPricePrice price codepre  pmethod on the Product entity must be persisted to SQL Azure, calculations on a range of prices will take place and the result will be saved to Azure Table Storage.p  pHow would you solve thisp  pThoughtsp  p1 I thought about implementing my own change tracker based on Castle.DynamicProxy, but that seems rather tedious.p  p2 Implement events internally in the domain entities. This is not a good thing.p

Im getting a clean copy of the code from the source code repository and then using msbuild to run a AspNetCompiler task to do all the precompile for the website.p  pThe thing that is confusing me is that I need to specify a VirtualPath or MetabasePath. I dont have a metabase path  I want to just compile it into a local directory that can then be deployed to whatever servers are chosen ie dev servers first then live servers later.p  pVirtualPath is tricky because I want the same code to be deployable into multiple locations  the code uses some context and configuration details to work out its SiteID to display different info  so specifying a single virtual path doesnt seem wise.p  pThere are various other questions out there along a similar line eg a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3333966virtualpathinaspnetcompilermsbuildtaskdoesithavetobeequaltothefinVirtualPath in AspNetCompiler MSBuild Task  does it have to be equal to the final deployed Virtual Patha  but the only answers Ive found seem to be more anecdotal  ie they jsut say it seems to make no difference in their experience.p  pHowever, I cant believe that it really makes no difference. There must be some situation in which this is used or else it wouldnt be there and wouldnt be required.p  pSo does anybody know and preferably have a reference for what this does What problems might be caused by passing a made up virtual path into the taskp

Negative 308 pI have inherited a project which deploys a common assemlby DLL to the GAC. In the Setup project, the Properties window of the Primary output from Common specifies the Folder property as Global Assembly cache.p  pHowever, when I navigate to the GAC in Windows Explorer, I cannot find any trace of that assembly.p  pI have to assume it is there, because it contains the DAL and the database is being hit.p  pIn the project itself, I note that in the AssemblyInfo.cs file, the following lines are commented out [assembly AssemblyKeyFile] and [assembly AssemblyKeyName] p  pBut on the signing tab, there is a key specified and the Sign the Assembly checkbox is checked.p  pI just want to understand why it is not listed in the GAC via the shfusion.dll  viewer. I have fixed a few bugs and would like the confidence that the updated dll was deployed to the GAC without having to manually do so.p  p[edit] I finally found that dll in the GAC and using Decompiler, have ascertained that it does not include my changes. I guess this means the installer does not work and I need to manually install it.p  pCheersp

Negative 308 pFor our CI builds, we are using a companywide set of rules for PMD and Checkstyle. They are packaged as a maven artifact in an internal repository and are pulled on every build.p  pI would like to use those same rules in Sonar, but the only approach I have found is to download and unpack the rules manually, then import them into a Sonar quality profile individually. This has several downsides  there is more work to do, the rules are not kept uptodate automatically and the import of PMD rulesets does not work properly out of the box  the referenced rulesets are not being found.p  pIs there a way to tell Sonar to pull an artifact with common rules from a maven repo or a better way to configure quality profiles and keep them in syncp

Negative 308 pright now i am planning on programming a little server in CC. The destination for that software will be some kind of a linux server, so i thought programmin the server on linux would be the best idea. The problem is, that i own a MacBook Air and i set up a Linux VM but the IDE Qt creator is freaking me out, so that i thought about developing the server within Xcode and then, when finished compiling it within the VM. So i am wondering how high the grade of portability is when it comes to pthread and socket.h If they are portable to a certain grade would you recommend me to develop in Xcode I am a kind of familar with Xcode because the client of the server will be an iOS app. Sorry for my poor english Im from GER and possibly thanks for your comment  p

Negative 308 p Seems like Im hitting a wall with this one, and not having much documentation on the matter isnt helping either.p  pI run large custom import jobs to CRM regularly, and all of them involve calling the organization service from a custom client to push records into CRM.

Negative 308 pIn the past, I have always used PHP for even my basic site design stuff, and I have never used  the .html extension. Several reasons for doing this, but one of the biggest ones was being able to use PHP Includes on my site, so I would only have to design my navigation once. p  pThis worked fine, because Dreamweaver was always able to render basic PHP stuff that was not really Serverside, like the includes. But now, I am trying to switch to using Adobe Edge Code, because it is truly lightweight and I dont have to load up a big application on slower computers to do work. It is also really nice, because it does have great CSS editing, and a wonderful live preview that just works in browser. From what I have found out, their is no way of doing the cooler stuff, when you are using .php files. p  pSo  I guess my question is, Is it possible to do something like PHPIncludes only using HTMLCSSJS Or do I really need to stop being lazy and switch my workflow back to doing all HTML, and just CopyPaste the nav sections on each page.p  pAlso  sorry if this question is to much like a Discussion, I tried to write it as straight forward as I could. p  pEdit The application supports JavaScript, CSS, and HTML and, one of my friends is recommending jQuery. Anyone know how it would work with jQuery Or if it wouldp

Negative 308 pI have recently created a pretty robust API built around Entity Frameworks DbContext. I am using a lot of metadata programming and taking advantage of the fact that I can get my data with a call like DbContext.SettypeofCustomer. Only, in my API I do not know at compile time what type I will be passing to the Set method. This is working very well with EntityFramework and I would like to add another layer abstraction and have it work with both EntityFramework or DataServiceContext. So, I really have two questions.p  pFirstly, and more specifically, is there a DataServiceContext i.e. odatawcf equivalent to the DbContext.Settype methodp  pSecondly, and more generally, is there a good resource that compares the APIs provided by DbContext with DataServiceContext p

Negative 308 pIm relatively new to VideoJS Ive used it successfully in all browsers EXCEPT ie lt 9.

I dont get a SWF dynamically embedded when I check my log and do some debugging via the console I can still see the  tag I am assuming that I should be seeing a dynamically generated and embedded .swf file for the fallback.p  pIve seen in a couple of threads that the latest release of VideoJS is broken  Flash fallback is not working.

In this mode the application doesnt take full advantage of everything IIS 7.X has to offer.p      pIntegrated mode handles all requests through a unified pipeline for IIS and is tightly integrated with ASP.NET through that same pipeline.   ASP.NET sees every relevant request and manipulates things along the way rather than acting as an external pluginp blockquote  ol liWhat king of advantages are Integrated mode to offerli ol  pFrom the second linkp  blockquote   pIIS uses the virtual location of the DLL file in the file system to map the ISAPI extension into the URL namespace that is served by IISp blockquote  pLets say a request arives in IIS httplocalhost. p  ol liWhat would be that URL namespace that IIS serves And where is set the virtual location of the DLLli ol  pSorry for those newby question.

Compiler may report an error complaining about lack of memory when set a high inlinelimit. p  pstrongfrenameregistersstrong attempts to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by making use of registers left over after register allocation. This optimization will most benefit processors with lots of registers. p  pFor inlinefunctions, although it can reduce the numbers of function calls, but it may lead to a large binary files, so finlinefunctions may introduce severe cache penalties and become even slower than O2. I think the cache penalties not only depends on the program itself. p  pFor renameregisters, I dont think it will have any positive impact on a cisc architecture like x86.p  pMy question has 2.5 part p  p[Answerd]1. Am I right to claim that whether a program can run faster with O3 option depends on the underlying platformarchitecturep  pEDIT The 1st part has been confirmed as true. David Hammen also claim that we should be very careful with regard to how optimization and floating point operations interact on machines with extended precision floating point registers like Intel and AMD.p  p2.strongWhen can I confidently use O3 optionstrong I suppose these two optimizations especially the renameregisters may lead to a different behaviors from O0O2. I saw some programs compiled with O3 got crashed during execution, is it deterministic If I run an executable once without any crash, does it mean it is safe to use O3p  pEDIT The deterministicity has nothing to do with the optimization, it is a multithreading problem. However, for a multithread program, it is not safe to use O3 when we run an executable once without errors. David Hammen shows that O3 optimization on floating point operations may violate the strict weak ordering criterion for a comparison. strongIs there any other concern we need to take care when we want to use O3 optionstrongp  p[Answered]3. If the answer of the 1st question is yes, then when I change the target platform or in a distributed system with different machines, I may need to change between O3 and O2. Is there any general ways to decide whether I can get a performance improvement with O3 For example, more registers, short inline functions, etc.p  pEDIT The 3rd part has been answered by Louen as the variety of platforms make general reasoning about this problem impossible When evaluating the performance gain by O3, we have to try it with both and benchmark our code to see which is faster.p

Negative 308 pI have an application that uses two separate models stored in a single database. The first model is set up with migrations and is the one that has created the migrations data in the database. The second is a very simple model that needs no model validation at all  the tables it uses exist and are of the proper structure. The second Context works fine in a separate database with the same table structure.p  pThe problem is it fails when running in the same database with the first model since it does provide some sort of model validation. It complains that the context has changed since the last update, but of course the the migrations data does not contain anything about the second contexts tables.p  pIs it possible to turn off the meta data validation for the context, and just let the second context work against the tables as is, since I know that worksp  pin the context constructor but that has no effect.p

Define 2 to an innocuous variant, in case ltlimits.hgt declares 2.    For example, HPUX 11i ltlimits.hgt declares gettimeofday.   define 2 innocuous2   System header to define stub macros and hopefully few prototypes,     which can conflict with char 2  below.     Prefer ltlimits.hgt to ltassert.hgt if STDC is defined, since     ltlimits.hgt exists even on freestanding compilers.    ifdef STDC  include ltlimits.hgt else  include ltassert.hgt endif  undef 2   Override any GCC internal prototype to avoid an error.    Use char because int might match the return type of a GCC    builtin and then its argument prototype would still apply.   ifdef cplusplus extern C endif char 2   The GNU C library defines this for functions which it implements     to always fail with ENOSYS.  Some functions are actually named     something starting with  and the normal name is an alias.   if defined stub2  defined stub2 choke me endif  int main   return 2       return 0  codepre  pSo, I copied, pasted replacing all of the 2s with ruserok and compiled this code using the generated GCC compilerp  precode.armpokylinuxgnueabigcc o test.o test.c codepre  pto see if the ruserok, ruserokaf and iuserok functions dodont exist, and I received the following compilation errorp  precodetmpccU8YszI.o In function main test.c.text0x8 undefined reference to ruserok collect2 error ld returned 1 exit status codepre  pwhich, is the same undefined reference to ruserok error as above. As a sanity check, since I had installed the UbuntuLinaro ARM GCC compiler through the Ubuntu Software center earlier, I compiled the same code with the armlinuxgnueabigcc compiler, but the code compiled fine without any errors.

My phone, HTC Incredible does have a perfectly working zoom on its native camera app. If I comment out the zoomControl parts of the code, everything works fine and all other features of the custom camera work fine even with the zoomControl code in there, it just doesnt zoom.p

receive a 2D texture and are meant to scale it beautifully across a highres 2D surface the device screen.

I wish to use the exact same algorithm in an optimized way.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  ol lipI found that if I do all the texture fetches with a constant vector instead of dependent vectors I get a major performance improvement, so this is obviously a big bottleneck  probably because of the cache. However, I still need to do those fetches. I played with doing at least some of the fetches with vec2 varyings without any swizzling but it didnt improve anything. I wonder what might be a good way to efficiently poll 21 texels.pli lipI found that a major part of the calculations is being done multiple times with the exact same set of texels  because the output is scaled by at least x2, and I poll with GLNEAREST. There at least 4 fragments that fall on exactly the same texels. If the scaling is x4 on a highres device, there are 16 fragments that fall on the same texels  which is a big waste. Is there any way to perform an additional shader pass that will calculate all the values that dont change across multiple fragments I thought about rendering to an additional offscreen texture, but I need to store multiple values per texel, not just one.pli ol  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  ol liTried to simplify the boolean expressions using known boolean rules  saved me few operations but didnt have any effect on performance.li ol  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  ol liThought about a way to pass calculations to the vertex shader  just have a geometry that creates my full screen, but with a lot of vertices that correspond to each original pixel before scaling. For example, if my original texture is 320x200 and my target screen is 1280x800, there will be 320x200 vertices spread evenly. Then, do most of the calculations in those vertices.

Negative 308 pI am developing an app that shows a camera preview, takes a picture, and then shows the picture to the user. Since the window size, preview size and camera capture size do not match up, the app crops the resulting image to the correct aspect and then scales it to the window dimension before showing it.p  pThe problem I have is thisp  pAt the call to Camera.takePicture the preview surface is filled with a copy of the captured image. This image is in a different aspect than what was previously shown in preview window, so the image looks stretched. This image is shown for a second before the app can show a new window with the croppedscaled image.p  pIs there a way to prevent this last frame from filling the preview windowp
Negative 308 pIm developer on a big system 100 Projects in Solution, 100 000 LOC,  10 Services, ... and did the installation of this system in the past with wix and it worked fine. Now I need a way to patch Minor Upgrade parts of the system and run into several issues.p  pMy Current Wix Setup is as followingp  ul liI have VS2010 and Wix3.6 Toolset and TFS2012 to Build the whole thing and get an installerli liIm using a Setup Library Project Type per Serviceli liIm using exactly one Setup Project to bundle things together and get one installer for the whole system.li ul  pIts not possible to change this setup.p  pThe Setup Library Projects are set up as followingp  ul liI use the heatdirectory msbuild task to generate the components and files and Im using preprocessor variables to modify the file paths. li liI need to modify the file paths because it must be possible to build an installer on the local developer system and to build the installer on the tfs build system which is different in folder structures.li liThe TFS uses always the same directory to compile subsequent versions of the software and moves the output after successful compilation to a unique folder structure.li ul  pNow I need a patch.  I created the Patch.wxs and called candle and light for it. I called torch to get the difference file. And finally want to create the patch with pyro. Everything worked fine with a simple testproject, but on the big system Pyro has the problem that it cant find the files to install. Through my setup see above, I must use preprocessor variables and have a full qualified path in my wix output for example Cbuildsmyproductprodct.exe as file source. After moving the TFS output to another location this path is not valid anymore. I tried to use bt and bu switches for pyro, but this does only work for relative paths or for named bindpaths.p  pNow I wanted to change my wix project setup to use named bindpaths rather than preprocessor variables, but it seems that this is not possible.  heat can only use preprocessor variables or wixvariables but it seems not to be possible to use bindpath variables. heat provides a switch wixvar which should create binder variables instead of preprocessor variables but I does exactly nothing.p  pNow I tried do use no wix and no preprocessor variables in heat and tell light per bu bt switches where to find the files. But if I do not set a preprocessor variable the resulting files look like Sourcesproduct.exe. I cant get rid of this Sources. I know that I can transform all the xml with xslt and remove the Sources but thats a workaround which I would only implement if no other solution is possible. This would also mean that there is a problem in the wix toolchain.p  pIt looks like pyro does only support bindpath variables and heat does only support preprocessor and wix variables. This seems to be really crazy, because how should they work togetherp  pstrongHow can I create a patch if I use lit, light, candle, heat, torch and pyro and if the original build paths have changed which is very common on a build system and the file paths are created with heat and therefore be fixed or preprocessor or wix variablesstrongp

Negative 308 pSo once again the famous topic. I have to say that I had read all the similar topics here and also googled it. But nothing helps.br My apps structure is as follows codeRootControllercode is codeTabControllercode, then every tab has its own codeNavigationControllercode with the codeViewControllercode inside. And inside the ViewController I placed a codeUITableViewcode. All designed in IB. codeDataSourcecode and codeDelegatecode are connected properly. codeTableViewcode uses custom codeTableCellcode but also I had tried the standard codeTableCellcode. Also there is a codeUISegmentedControlcode to change the codeDataSourcecode arraybr What I checked and double checked in short everything I had found in similar topicsp  ul limy codeViewControllercode does declare and implement codeUITableViewDelegatecode and codeUITableViewDataSourcecode or It wont be possible to connect corresponding properties in IBli licodeDataSourcecode and codeDelegatecode properties are connected properly in IB. Also it is duplicated in code by codesetDelegateselfcode and codesetDataSourceselfcode.li limy custom codeTableCellcode has marked User Interaction Enabledli limy custom codeTableCellcode contains 2 labels and one image all with no User Interaction Enabled markli liit calls code[tableView reloadData]codeli litried to code[tableView becomeFirstResponder]codeli liTableView has options like Single cell choosing, Allow User Interaction, Allow cell selection while editing etc. markedli lithere is no typo in codedidSelectRowAtIndexPathcode like DEselect or something. Futhermore the codeTableViewcodes delegate methods were copypasted from working app with changing the code inside methods. I mean there couldnt be any typos in methods namesdeclaring.li lithe codedidSelectRowAtIndexPathcode method contains only one code line and it is codeNSLogdidSelectRowAtIndexPathcodeli licodeXCodecode was restarted several timesli limade the codeclean all targetscode li linot using the codeARCcode in the projectli lithere are no heavy operations or any other operations running while displaying the tableli ul  pThe codeTableViewcode by itself works fine in meaning of filling with data and displaying it. But if I tap the cell it highlights with blue and it looks like that it freezes the choice. From the moment It highlighted one cell any other cell couldnt be highlighted and highlighted cell couldnt be unselected. The didSelectRowAtIndexPath not being called. But if try to tap the cells many many times with dragging the table then sometimes the method does call. Like in being called in very rare cases and if there are not more than 3 records in a table. It is a very strange issue and I cant fight it. I feel like TableView receives the tap but somehow cant handle it.br the ViewControllerp  precodeinterface SecondTabVC  UIViewController ltUITableViewDelegate,UITableViewDataSourcegt        IBOutlet UISegmentedControl  sgmTopMenu has 3 segments      NSArray  arrHrefLinks     NSArray  arrImgLinks      IBOutlet UIImageView  imgFiles      int selectedSegmentIndex     IBOutlet UITableView tblLinks    property retain,nonatomic IBOutlet UISegmentedControl  sgmTopMenu  property retain,nonatomic IBOutlet UIImageView  imgFiles  property retain,nonatomic NSArray  arrHrefLinks property retain,nonatomic NSArray  arrImgLinks  property retain,nonatomic IBOutlet UITableView tblLinks   IBActiononTopMenuTapidsender  end codepre  pimplementationp  precode     called when UIsegments Value changed, linked in IB     IBActiononTopMenuTapidsender               selectedSegmentIndex  UISegmentedControlsender.selectedSegmentIndex          NSLogonTopMenuTap i,selectedSegmentIndex          switch selectedSegmentIndex              case 0              case 1                  tblLinks.hidden  NO                 tblLinks.delegate  self                 tblLinks.dataSource  self                 tblLinks.userInteractionEnabled  YES                 tblLinks.allowsSelectionYES                 tblLinks.allowsSelectionDuringEditing  YES                 [tblLinks reloadData]                 [tblLinks becomeFirstResponder]                 break             case 2  settings                 tblLinks.hidden  YES               tblLinks.delegate  nil               tblLinks.dataSource  nil                 break                      NSIntegernumberOfSectionsInTableViewUITableView tableView          return 1            Customize the number of rows in the table view.

Negative 308 pIm reading the section on array arithmetic in KampR and came across something curious. I posted the whole paragraph for context, but Im mainly focused on the bold part.p  blockquote   pIf p and q point to members of the same array, then relations like ,   , lt, , etc., work properly. For example, p lt q is true if p points   to an earlier member of the array than q does. Any pointer can be   meaningfully compared for equality or inequality with zero. But the   behavior is undefined for arithmetic or comparisons with pointers that   do not point to members of the same array. strongThere is one exception   the address of the first element past the end of an array can be used   in pointer arithmetic.strongp blockquote  pWhat is the reason for this exception Is an extra piece of memory allocated to the end of any array when their size is defined If so, for what purpose Is it to end the array with a null characterp

Negative 308 pstrongShort Versionstrongp  pIs there any tool that will let me use a single Django admin page to affect multiple Django installations on different serversp  pstrongDetailed Versionstrongp  pIve got a bunch of different servers, each with their own Django installation.  This works great ... except when I want to do something via the Django admin to all of the servers, in which case I have to log on to each server separately.p  pFor instance, lets say I have a release coming and a coworker whos not a programmer wants to use the admin to make a message record about the release for the servers users to see.  They have to log in to each servers admin individually, create the message record, then move on to the next server until theyve gotten through all of them.p  pTo get around this whenever I have a multiserver change Ive been using Git ie.p  ol liI make a commit with files for the changeli liI push that commitli liI pull that commit on all of the servers at once using Fabric.li ol  pHowever, this too is suboptimal, because we cant take advantage of the admin interface, and doing something as simple as adding a new release coming message requires an actual minirelease itself.p  pSo, it seems to me the best way to handle this would be if there was some sort of metaadmin tool my coworker could use to Django admin work on multiple servers at once.

Negative 308 pI know this question has been asked before, and my solution is the same as many of the answers but I have a special test case that wont work correctly with the common solution to this problem.p  pThe solution that I have found for the zip problem like many others isp  precodedefine zip l1 l2map list l1 l2 codepre  p. . .which works great with given arguments such as p  precodezip a b c 1 2 3 gt a 1 b 2 c 3 codepre  pbut I also want the zip function to work for cases where my arguments do not match length like p  precodezip a b c 1 gt a 1 b  c  codepre  pI have not found a solution to this problem and not really sure how to approach it where each list can be any length. p

I added the entire projects source code to GitHub herep  blockquote   pa hrefhttpsgithub.comdoctranggwtactivitiesplacesmvpexample relnofollowhttpsgithub.comdoctranggwtactivitiesplacesmvpexampleap blockquote  pI decided to rename my codeSimpleModulecode to codeWebModulecode so, whereas in all my code snippets below, the GWT module is named codeSimpleModulecode or codesimplemodulecode, in my latest code you will see the module named codeWebModulecode and codewebmodulecode respectively  but they are 1 in the samep  pstrongNotestrong I understand I might not have things set up perfectly here, and might have some dead code codeSimpleModule.csscode, etc. that isnt being used at all, but this is my very first GWT app and I just want to get the thing up and runningp  pI am experimenting with my first GWT app 2.5.1 and am trying to get a svery simple UI to display using the recommended Places amp Activities framework for history management as well as utilizing a basic MVP architecture.p  pFor simplicitys sake, I have placed all the Java code inside my codeSimpleModule.javacode entry point. Once I get this proofofconcept working, Ill decompose codeSimpleModule.javacode into more classes.p  pMy goal is to have the GWT app load when the user goes to my home page me.example.com. Because of this, I create a codeSimpleModule implements EntryPointcode, and then renamed the host page from codeSimpleModule.htmlcode to codeindex.htmlcode so that when users go to me.example.com or

Negative 308 pIm new to this world and I need to understand some of the concepts of Backbone and Marionette. Here Im trying to explain some of the concepts Im learning. It would be great to having some feedback on them.p  pThe coderendercode function defines the logic for rendering a template. When it is finished, the codeonRendercode callback is called. Here I suppose the rendered view has been not attached to the DOM. It is composed by a codetagNamecode the default is codedivcode that contains the template I attached to it. To explicitly insert that tag into the DOM I need to append it somewhere. Am I wrongp  pIn general, I do the following.p  precodevar view  new MyView view.render container.appendview.el codepre  pMarionette extends Backbone with the concept of regions. The codeshowcode method can be called on a region to present a specific view.p  precodevar view  new MyView region.showview codepre  pIn this case, the codeshowcode method will be call the coderendercode function on its own and finally, when the content of the view will be put in the DOM, the codeonShowcode is called on that view. Is it okp  pFrom Marionette doc there is also another callback called codeonDomRefreshcode. From my experiments, Ive noticed that this method is called before codeonShowcode. So, my supposition is that the view has not been attached to the DOM yet. But the doc says the following.p  blockquote   pTriggered after the view has been rendered, has been shown in the DOM   via a Marionette.Region, and has been rerendered.p blockquote  pCould you give some hints on itp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 308 pTotally different question than the one I asked an hour agop  pUsing MySQL, moving from MyISAM to InnoDB tables.  Database design started with dumping the data and reimporting it without foreign keys or constraints. Adding those one at a time to find errors.p  pWhats the correct way to handle having codeParentTablecode and codeChildTablecode, where there is both a onetomany relationship from codeParentTablecode to codeChildTablecode, and a onetoone relationship from codeParentTablecode to codeChildTablecodep  pThis can occur when a codeParentTablecode has many codeChildTablecode choices, and has either a currently selected codeChildTablecode choice.p  pMy situation is where there are multiple photographs of something, and I want to have a record of all of those, along with the one I feel is best.  Resolution, clarity, color accuracy.  For my situation, there conceptually isnt a codeParentTablecode until theres a codeChildTablecode, and visaversa.p  pIn my current MyISAM design, codeParentTablecode has codeIDChildTablecode to create the onetoone relationship of the best choice, and codeChildTablecode has codeIDParentTablecode to create the onetomany relationship of all the available choices.  Upon the first creation, a codeParentTablecode is created then a codeChildTablecode, then codeParentTablecode is updated with the codeIDChildTablecode.p  pIf I add foreign key constraints, I cant create new records simultaneously.p  pAll I can think of isp  ul liNot have constraints in this situationli liRemove the onetoone relationship, and have a codeBestcode boolean in codeChildTablecode which introduces the undesired possibilities of there being zero or multiple codeBestcode choices among multiple codeChildTablecode entries for a single codeParentTablecodeli liI could allow one or both of the foreign key IDs to be null.  Right now theyre not null.  Dont love this idea because Id only want nulls to be valid for the fractions of a second between the two inserts.li liWait for MySQLInnoDB to allow deferring foreign key constraint checks in a transaction until commit.  MySQL 5.6 doesnt support this, dont know if theres plans to.li liBefore the two inserts, disable foreign key checks.

Negative 308 pSo I think Im getting a hold on the OOP stuff, but right when I think Im understanding it, something funky happens.p  pIm assigning a variable thats been created in one function into another, and then altering it note, this is NOT a global, Ive learned my lesson about that.  But Im still getting an unbound local error, which is confusing me.  Ive read through most of the documentation here and elsewhere about this error, and I havent found an answer to this specific question.p  pHeres the error message  p  precodeTraceback most recent call last File CUsersTony DiBiaseAppDataLocalESRIDesktop10.2AssemblyCache2801A62B53E617B4D465BB6072FDEEF9parameterizerfinaladdin.py, line 115, in onClick num  domainNumber.text UnboundLocalError local variable domainNumber referenced before assignment codepre  pAnd heres what Im attempting to do editing out the exogenous parts for brevityp  precodeclass domainNumberobject Implementation for parameterizerfinaladdin.domainNumber ComboBox     def initself         self.items  [3000, 1000, 200, 100]         self.editable  True         self.enabled  True         self.dropdownWidth  WWWWWW         self.width  WWWWWW         self.hinttext  Cell resolution m2      def onEditChangeself, text         so pass the text changed to a domainNumber.text, which can be passed to other    functions         self.text  text   class printFinal     Implementation for parameterizerfinaladdin.printFinal     def initself         self.enabled  True         self.checked  False     def onClickself         iterate through domains, using number set in domainNumber         counter  0         num  domainNumber.text So calling the variable from the other function         num  num1         run the business logic for the esri pythonaddin         while counter lt num             do stuff             num1 to iterate through and finish the loop codepre  pSo whats pretty apparent is that the error occurs when I try to ALTER the domainNumber.text variable inside the printFinal class.  But thats whats confusing me, because the printFinal class isnt trying to alter a global variable, and when I call the domainNumber.text INSIDE the printFinal class, it should be local and thus editable in the printFinal namespace  I mean, I specifically am saving domainNumber.text INTO a local variable, and then altering THAT rather than trying to alter domainNumber.text itself.p  pRight  I access variables from other functions elsewhere in my code, and dont encounter this problem, its only because Im subtracting it by 1 here thats encountering the problem.   How can I get it to do that, without just making the variable global which Im trying to avoidp  pThanks a lotp

Negative 308 pIn our TFS 2013 project we have a set of simple MSBuild based integration tests alongside our unit tests which test stored procedures and other logic which need a database server to be present, for examplep  precode[TestMethod] [TestCategoryIntegration] public void SomeTest      InitialiseData     var results  RunStoredProcedure     AssertResultIsCorrectresult  codepre  pAs you can see we have tagged these tests as Integration so that we can supply a test case filter that excludes these tests when we dont want to run them.  These tests are all designed to run against an installed copy of our database we have a process which deploys an uptodate copy of our database to a SQL Server instance.p  pWhat we would like to do is create an integration test build definition in TFS which we can schedule to deploy our database and then run all of these tests against a strongspecificstrong SQL Server instance.  p  pAt the moment we use the standard TFS build process with two test sources  the first runs a unit test which installs the database, the second contains all of the actual integration tests.  The problem we have is passing the connection string amp database name into the unit tests from the build definition.  Currently the connection string is in app.config files for each of the test projects, however this is less than ideal as it means that we are constantly getting failing test runs, either due to developers checking in the wrong connection string, or running tests locally against the build database at the same time that a build is running.  This setup also limits us to running one build at a time.p  pIs there a way that we can specify the connection string and database name to use as part of the build workflow template insteadp

Negative 308 pIm trying to get into android programming..but needed to know a few things to clear the road.. one of wc is the message handling of android..p  pSo when using an android phone you can see INBOX , OUTBOX, SEnt, Draft, etcp  pare these real folders, or different tables in the android system or same table w different category ID or something like thatp  pWhat I wanted to do is manage my SMS messages through my App preferably Phonegap package. I was assuming this is a simple sql query to androids sql lite p  pMore importantly I wanted to be able to simply send sms by putting the said message in the outbox.p  pI was assuming that, android constantly scans the outbox and sends any message put there and moves said message to sentbox etc. So id simply have my app just put messages in said folder or table and Android will take care of the rest. p  pIs this how android works or is it at least possible to do things this wayp  pI know I read that I could create my own SMS app and have the different types of messages stored in the way I like it , but I really wanted to simplify things and use the existing  built in android way of doing things. This way, even if my app has crashed or is off, all messages received or sent manually by the user, go into their default inbox, outbox, sentbox folders, and the next time I fire up my app , everything is in the sample place  not having to have my own inboxoutbox tables etcp  pregards to allp

Negative 308 pHappy New Year all,p  pI am developing a C Winforms SDI application that relies heavily on background worker threads to carry out longrunning database queries. My main dialog box contains a progress label and progress bar but also a Toolstrip Menu, which contains two ToolStrip Labels and two Toolstrip Progress Bars. I update the progress labels and progress bars via delegates called by event handlers OnUpdateProgressobject sender UpdateProgressEventArgs e.p  pI am seeking your expert opinion on what approach I should use when invoking the UI delegate with regards to trying to achieve a more generic and reusable approach.p  pThusfar I have considered 2p  p1 When instantiating a worker thread from the main dialog to carry out a background task, pass in a handle to the Label and Progress Bar controls to be updated when the event handler calls back, and 2 Pass in the name of the Label and Progress Bar to be updated when the event handler is invoked and use the Form.Find method to retrieve a Control[] of matching controls.p  pI cannot decide on which of these approaches to use or indeed if there is a better way of doing this. I believe that method 1 is a little clunky and inelegant but that method 2 is prone to failure and notwithstanding that the Form.Find method may introduce unreasonable overhead searching for embedded Toolstrip Menu Controls.p  pI have searched previously askedanswered questions for a solution.p  pYour advice if much appreciatedp
Negative 308 pI am constructing a TCP reverse proxy. I can successfully send and receive data. However, I would like to change the outgoing port. So for example, I accept connections on say 8000, then proxy that data to another host on 8001. Sometime down the road, I would like to change that port to 8002 as fast as possible. I want to be able to do this by having the proxy run in one thread, and the rest of the work in another.

Negative 308 pI have a GWT webapp to which I would like to add some social features. I am using Google maps and basically there are several markers on the map. When a user clicks on a marker a new DialogBox is opened. Each marker has a unique ID associated to it. In the dialog box the user has the option to start a discussion using comments. I tried using Disqus and Google comments, but they need a unique page URL for each comment box, i.e for each marker, I would have to create a new page, which is not possible as the markers increase as the users drop them on the map. Facebook comments does serve my purpose as it checks for the validity of the URL only upto .appspot.com, so I put my ID after the , and even though such a page does not exist, the comment box works. But the Facebook comment box does not render everytime.p  pAt this point, I am open to solutions that might force me to work from scratch.p  pTo sum it all up.

Negative 308 pI am completely a beginner in programming, therefore please tell me if the answer to my question is very evident and obvious.p  pI started learning python a week ago, and having learnt the basics of using the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiNewton27smethod relnofollowNewtonRaphson methoda to solve equations, I came up with a piece of code that can give you atleat only 1 solution of a cubic equation. Here is the code I devised  p  precodedef deg3a,b,c,d,g       yag3bg2cgd     return y def solvedeg3equation     efloatinpute  for ax3bx2cxd0, with maximum error of e     afloatinputa      bfloatinputb      cfloatinputc      dfloatinputd      count1     g0.01     while absdeg3a,b,c,d,ggte and countlt100         countcount1         if 3ag22bgc0             gg0.001         ggdeg3a,b,c,d,g3ag22bgc     if countlt100         printThe best guess is,g         printiterations required ,count     else         printmaximum iterations exceeded          printiterations ,count,current guess ,g   codepre  pOne of the shortcoming of the Newtons method is that or fx0, it gives a math error and crashes. To overcome this, I used gg0.001, if the current value of g gives a zero derivative, where g is the current guess. strongIs there a better way to remove this problem, without using complex functionsstrongp  pAnother question I have is, strongcan I include the provision of providing more than one root with minor changes to the codestrong One idea is to change the guess in such a way that now successive iterations bring about another root. But I do not know how to make such a guess, given one solution. p

Negative 308 pWe are using Github, and its associated issue tracking system ITS. We reference the issue id in the ITS in the commit message, linking the ITS and the commits. Since I had confused many issue ids in the commit messages of commits that were already pushed, I had to rewrite history in my Git repository. Everything went smooth, and I forcepushed my changes to Github. p  pI was hoping that the links from the issue in the ITS to the old commits which are not visible with codegit logcode anymore would be updated, and changed to the new commits that reference them. Unfortunately, they were not. Even though the commit from the issue does not exist anymore in the repository, it is still referenced from the issues website on Github. The commit that is referenced, however, does not show up in a normal codegit logcode. I am a bit puzzled as to the fact that I can, in fact, codegit checkout ltoldcommitgtcode, even though there is no evidence of this commit having ever existed in the log.p  pIs there a way to trigger a complete new repositoryreadin on Github, or can I somehow manually edit the linked commits Additionally, there is no link to the new commits from the issue. p  pI found a related help page from Github, but that only suggested to me that from the git push onwards, Github would handle everything itself a hrefhttpshelp.github.comarticlescanideleteacommitmessage relnofollowhttpshelp.github.comarticlescanideleteacommitmessageap  pThank youp

Negative 308 pI have a tabbased app with 2 tabs the first one performs multiple operations in a background thread downloading json and updates the UI on the main thread when the fetching is over. The second tab presents a camera as soon as it appears. When I open the app, the fetching starts in background in tab 1. If I switch to tab 2 while in the background thread in tab 1, the camera loads. If I wait until the main thread updated the UI still tab 1 before switching to tab 2, the camera takes 10 seconds to load, only showing a black screen. Whats even more weird is that the NSLogs tell me the camera is supposed to be already loaded, but a black screen shows up.

Negative 308 pIm working on an app that has several functions selected via tableview that all pretty much do the same thing, similar layout, similar buttons, similar input fields, etc. But different enough where I believe it justifies their own class. Each will display their own type of data and have different input fields, but all of the fields and layout will look the same, or at least have the same theme. Plus having separate classes would allow me to customize how each is laid out and the data it will display.p  pId like to have some advice on the best way to approach this. Here are the ideas Ive come up withp  pIdea 1 Create one Scene for each function, along with a separate segue for each could be 1020 Scenes total. A BaseViewController would be created, along with a ViewController class for each function that would subclass BaseViewController for some code reuse.p  pIdea 2 Similar to Idea 2 in that a BaseViewController would be created and classes for each function. However, instead of having one scene for each function in the Storyboard, there would only be one Scene and one Segue to that Scene. Before loading the scene, the Class for the Scene would be set to selected functions class. Problem is I have no idea how to do this or if this is even possible, Ive searched around and havent found any examples.p  pI like Idea 2 because I dont have to create a new scene for every function, thus its easier to create additional functions. But as I mentioned, not sure if this is even possible or if theres better approach.p

Negative 308 pI am using ggplot2 to make some simple figures with a series using coordinates to make rectangles along the xaxis. However, I cant seem to figure out how to remove the padding between the actual start of the plot x1 location and the leftmost edge of the plot, at what would be 0,0. For example, I am using the following codep  precodelibraryggplot2 librarygrid pngfilenamesample.png, width5600, height70 plot.data lt data.framestart.pointsc1,end.pointsc10 p lt ggplotplot.data p  geomrectaesxminstart.points, xmaxend.points, ymin0, ymax1, fillred  themebw  ylabpastesprintf60s, , nSamplelabeln  themeaxis.title.y  elementtextsize  30, colour  black, angle  0 dev.off codepre  pThe variables codemystartcode and codemystopcode are just lists of start and stop coordinates for drawing rectangles. So, this plot creates a long horizontal figure, just as I want.p  pThe problem is, the figure looks like thisp  precodeaxislabel     lt white space gt ltactual plotgt lt white spacegt  codepre  pActual plot img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSFetw.png altenter image description herep  p...and I want to manually control this amount of codewhite spacecode. Ive tried setting codeplot.margincode and codepanel.margincode, but these seem to control other aspects of the plot. Please note, that on my sample picture the red starts at point of 1 as expected. I want this to border the y axis, and I dont want any trailing space after the end of the red bar.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated Ideally I would just remove all white space padding. Thanksp

Negative 308 pIn SSIS 2008 I have an Execute SQL Task in a Foreach loop that will fetch one single result value from a table and puts it in a variable for File System Task. The SQL code is similar top  precodeSELECT productcode FROM products WHERE eancode   codepre  pThe code will return the productcode from table products if it matches the corresponding eancode. The codecode is a variable in SSIS derived from an image filename.p  pBasically, the package loopsqltaskFStask will change the filename from eancode to productcode. p  pSometimes the package fails because the SQL task tries to get the productcode but cannot  return a result. This happens if eancode does not exist in the table. p  pstrongWhat can be done to deal with such an error so the loop doesnt stopstrongp  pI thought of these possible solutionsp  ol lipUse ISNULLproductcode,replacement is not an option. The result     set will be used into a variable which will be used to rename the     filename of the image. This will cause every no result image to get     the replacement name. Also, it just wont return anything, not     even the isnull replacement.pli lipChange the properties settings of the exec SQL task or ForEach Loop, so it skips to the next but which one and to whatpli lipAdd a failed precedence constraint from sql task to another child task. But what task should it lead to It basically has to nothing if no result set in sql task. pli lipChange the constraint to Complete, but this will cause the FileSystem task to give an error since it is missing values for the Destination filepathname. If the sql task fails it should not rename the file in next task. pli ol  pThe ideal situation would be if the sql task fails because of no result set, the current loop would leave the SQL step as is and go on with the next round.  p  pThanksp

Negative 308 pSo i have been using the codepclcode codeSampleConsensuscode module to do some line fitting and i found something awfully strange with the codepclcode point cloud usage.

Then all i should have to do is change the model coderansaccode is using and go againp  precoderansac.setSampleConsensusModelmodelLine2 ransac.compute This will fail, due to having no points. codepre  pSo coderansac.computecode fails, but why codemodelLine2code is defined and has a pointer to the cloud codeoutlierCloudcode which definitely has points p  pSo that line i said to pay attention to, if you move it so that codemodelLine2code is defined after codeoutlierCloudcode is filled out then it works just fine. Same example same everything. p  pThis suggests to me that codepclcode is taking a deep copy of this cloud even though it requests a shared pointer to it Isnt this insanely bad There are no scope changes or anything funny happening on my end, so why do i have to create codemodelLine2code after the data has been filled in the cloudp

Negative 308 pIm building a website with drupal and I would like to add a field for adding an html5 video player with content from YouTube and another popular plateform. p  pI thought that Id find my happiness with the module Embedded Media Field. I had to install it and by the same occasion the full Media modul.p  pSo Ive got a field when I create a new article but when I submit the form Ive got the following error message  Found no valid media with that url.p  pHowever when I look at this video  a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvYsAnxoGsCOI relnofollowhttpswww.youtube.comwatchvYsAnxoGsCOIa, the user can add video easily. But If you look the video at the minute 3, when the user create the field, He can choose between different fields types like Embedded Video, Embedded Audio and over. I dont have this possibility p  pSeem the module Embedded Media Field should be included in Embedded Media Field, but I have a big doubt because it dont appear in my list of modules ... and I dont find it in the module directory on a hrefhttpswww.drupal.orgproject relnofollowhttpswww.drupal.orgprojectap  pSo who can say me what module to use for   adding an html5 responsive player  adding a video galleryp  pBig thankz by advance p  pMickaelp
Negative 308 pIm kind of lost there, I want to setup a common codeMASTERSLAVEcode replication on a codeMariaDBcode database. I choose codeMASTERSLAVEcode over codeMASTERMASTERcode to avoid complexifying things. The codeSLAVEcode will be used only if the codeMASTERcode server is down.p  pIve setup codeMariaDB 10.0.xcode, but when I start reading on how to achieve this replication, they introduce Galera, which, if I understand correctly, replaces MariaDB.p  pWhat do you use to tell the SLAVE server to take the relay if the MASTER server is down  Is it handled automatically via the Galera Cluster p  pIf possible, I dont want my application to be aware of the slave server  I just want to configure it with the IP of MariaDB MASTER, and if it cant be reached, to use the SLAVE instead. But I do not want to specify this fallback in the application levelp  pThanksp

I have also gone through the Android  Camera documentation and learned about how they are using cameraPreview and surfaceView.p  pSo my question is what do I need to do now to be able to see the CameraPreview [or the surfaceView that holds the CameraPreview] instead of the Imageview so that I cam provide live camera feed like a split screen in landscape modep  pI hope the question is detailed enough.Still if you need any further info, just ask.p

The codeTextBlockcode named codenumCopyTBcode has its codeTextcode property bound to that of codeUpdownButtoncode, so the codeTextcode of codeUpdownButtoncode shows up on the codeTextBlockcode and updates correctly too. p  pHowever, commenting out the binding in XAML, and setting codenumCopyTBcodes codeTextcode in codebehind doesnt work quite right no text is shown initially only subsequent calling codemyUpdownButton.Textnew textcode works. The initial codeTextcode property is bound like followsp  precodeltlocalUpdownButton TextBinding PathCopies, ModeTwoWaygt codepre  pSo it seems that the original binding doesnt trigger codeSettercode in code behind.

Negative 308 pIm still exceptionally new to Android Development, about 2 weeks in to my first project. So, a resolution may be obvious, and I can only hope this eventually helps another in my shoes.p  pThe goal was to build an app for FireTV that would stream media ondemand or live video stream.p  pI started research on Amazons developer portal, downloaded AS, Amazon SDK, and anything else I was told I would need to continue. My first thoughts were to familiarize myself with Lollipop, using Google TVs for emulator, and using the TV Activity template, which from what I see is heavily based on the Leanback library.  I built and tested and modified to my hearts content, and had a working app, using emulators that can handle api21. Then came the time to retrofit what I had working with Amazons Fire TV sdk AddOn API 17. Learned a bit about AppCompat and a few other errors along the way, most I could figure out on my own.

I cant seem to get this detail correct and am not sure why. When I run the function as is without the remove part it just adds the new points ontop of the old ones.

Negative 308 pIm using Spring Data JPA and have a many to one relationship from Child to Parent Class using hibernate. Im writing a search API which would search on child table using some child table columns and return list of child objects along with some data from Parent class for each child object. Im doing by default eager fetch for many to one relationship. The problem im facing is lets say after searching child table 10 entries are returned then hibernate is doing 10 different select queries on parent class to get Parent object for each child object. Is there a way to optimize this  There is a solution given to similar problem a hrefhttpjdpgrailsdev.github.ioblog20140909springdatahibernatejoin.html relnofollowherea  but it is for one to many case. I could not find anything helpful regarding this on web also. Any ideas p

Negative 308 pBased on my understanding, each socket is associated with two buffers, a send buffer and a receive buffer, so when I call the codesendcode function, what happens is that the data to send will be placed into the send buffer, and it is the responsibility of Windows now to send the content of this send buffer to the other end.p  pIn a blocking socket, the codesendcode function does not return until the entire data supplied to it has been placed into the send buffer.p  pSo what is the size of the send bufferp  pI performed the following test sending 1 GB worth of datap  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  include ltWinSock2.hgt pragma commentlib, ws232.lib  include ltWindows.hgt  int main       Initialize Winsock     WSADATA wsa     WSAStartupMAKEWORD2, 2, ampwsa       Create socket     SOCKET s  socketAFINET, SOCKSTREAM, 0             Connect to 192.168.1.712345     sockaddrin address     address.sinfamily  AFINET     address.sinaddr.saddr  inetaddr192.168.1.7     address.sinport  htons12345     connects, sockaddrampaddress, sizeofaddress             Create 1 GB buffer AAAAAA...A     char buffer  new char[1073741824]     memsetbuffer, 0x41, 1073741824       Send buffer     int i  sends, buffer, 1073741824, 0      printfsend has returnednReturn value dnWSAGetLastError dn, i, WSAGetLastError            getchar     return 0  codepre  pOutputp  precodesend has returned Return value 1073741824 WSAGetLastError 0 codepre  pcodesendcode has returned immediately, does this means that the send buffer has a size of at least 1 GBp  pThis is some information about the testp  ul liI am using a TCP blocking socket.li liI have connected to a LAN machine.li liClient Windows version Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit.li liServer Windows version Windows XP SP2 32bit installed on Virtual Box.li ul  hr  pstrongEditstrong I have also attempted to connect to Google 173.194.116.1880 and I got the same results.p  pstrongEdit 2strong I have discovered something strange, setting the send buffer to a value between 64 KB and 130 KB will make codesendcode work as expectedp  precodeint sendbuffer  64  1024     64 KB int sendbuffersizeof  sizeofint setsockopts, SOLSOCKET, SOSNDBUF, charsendbuffer, sendbuffersizeof codepre  pstrongEdit 3strong It turned out thanks to Harry Johnston that I have used codesetsockoptcode in an incorrect way, this is how it is usedp  precodesetsockopts, SOLSOCKET, SOSNDBUF, charampsendbuffer, sendbuffersizeof codepre  pSetting the send buffer to a value between 64 KB and 130 KB strongdoes notstrong make codesendcode work as expected, strongbut ratherstrong setting the send buffer to code0code makes it block this is what I noticed anyway, I dont have any documentation for this behavior.p  pstrongSo my question now is where can I find a documentation on how codesendcode and maybe other socket operations work under Windowsstrongp

Negative 308 pSo, I thought I was on the right track with trying to imitate the bash shell, but Im having issues piping. I am getting an error executing the second command. I was wondering if someone could explain to me how to fix this and why its going wrong.  Im very new to C amp Linux commands so any supplemental information that could help me along the way would be also be appreciated.p  pThank you so much for your time. My code is below, but there is a lot of it. My issue is occurring in the execpipe function. I would normally include what I have used for input and what I am getting for output, but my sample input is actually executable files my professor gave us for testing.

Negative 308 pIve got a Visual Studio 2013 project, created with CMake and built both on my PC Windows 7 64bit and automatically with Jenkins, running on Windows Windows server 2008 R2, 64bit.

If during the execution of this method an exception is thrown the advice is not performed.p  pI think that this is pretty clearp  p2 strongAROUND ADVICEstrong, I know that this is the sequence diagram of the strongAround advicestrongp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiYcR9.jpg altenter image description herep  pand I have the following example of this kind of advicep  precodeAroundexecution com.journaldev.spring.model.Employee.getName public Object employeeAroundAdviceProceedingJoinPoint proceedingJoinPoint     System.out.printlnBefore invoking getName method     Object value  null     try          value  proceedingJoinPoint.proceed      catch Throwable e          e.printStackTrace          System.out.printlnAfter invoking getName method. Return valuevalue     return value  codepre  pReading the official documentation I found thatp  blockquote   pstrongAround advicestrong Advice that surrounds a join point such as a method   invocation. This is the most powerful kind of advice. Around advice   can perform custom behavior before and after the method invocation. It   is also responsible for choosing whether to proceed to the join point   or to shortcut the advised method execution by returning its own   return value or throwing an exception.p blockquote  pSo it seems to me that strongAround advicestrong is used to cut the method execution before and after the jointpoint execution. We can use it to control whether the advised method will execute or not. We can also inspect the returned value and change it. This is the most powerful advice and needs to be applied properly.p  pSo in the previous example I think that it is performed twice time the first one before that the stronggetNamestrong method is executed and a second one after that the stronggetNamestrong method is executed.p  pBut what exacty does thep  precodevalue  proceedingJoinPoint.proceed codepre  pI think that it is the division point between the execution before and after the joint point, in this case I think that the strongproceedstrong method say that the stronggetNamestrong method have to be performed and that its result is to be putted into the strongvaluestrong field. Is it right or am I missing somethingp  pSo coming back to the original statment I can say that p  blockquote   pAn strongAroundstrong advice can swallow, or halt the propagation of, an   exception thown by the target method.p blockquote  pwhy can I say that this is true What exatly meansp

Could the decoding relate to somehow to the concatenation process That in order for the program to concatenate, it needs to decode those both strings, and only after that it can make the concatenation, and then encode those to bytes I had the coding method input like this in the beginning of the file  em coding utf8 emp

Negative 308 pI am working on a simple 2D game with Java, swing and no framework. I have a rectangular player that the user can move around. On the map are few obstacles which the player should not be able to go through. I did this by making a new Rectangle Object for the player and each obstacle with their bounds. But Im not really sure if this is the right way to do it. It works but the movements of the player are not really user friendly. If the player wants to pass two obstacles they must be on the perfect coordinates to pass.p  pIs it even a good idea to check for intersections between the player and the obstacle with a Rectangle object or should I do it another wayp  pNow for my 2nd questionbr Id like to replace the rectangular hitboxes with the same hitbox but with rounded corners so the player could pass more easily.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1MTkO.png altMy game with hitboxes enabled brThis is what the game looks like with hitboxes enabled.p  pThe code that checks if the player and the obstacles have yet intersectedp  precodefor Player p  this.getPlayerArray      Rectangle recPlayer  p.playerBounds         for Obstacle kiste  obstacleArray              Rectangle recKiste  kiste.obstBounds              if recPlayer.intersectsrecKiste                  p.setX100 Not actual code here                        codepre  pThe function that returns the hitbox of the player  obstaclep  precodepublic Rectangle obstBounds      return new Rectanglethis.getX,      this.getY, image.getImage.getWidthnull,      image.getImage.getHeightnull  codepre

Negative 308 pI am looking for a method of constraining the input of an EditText so that the user input fits within the space of a PDF. Multiple Lines and paragraphs must be allowed.p  pThe difficulty is that the space the text takes within the EditText bears little relation to the space used on the PDF. Constraining the number of characters can be defeated by text containing a number of line breaks, while constraining the number of lines will result in less text for devices with a narrower screens, and more for devices with wider screens.

Negative 308 pFor example, heres the problem I faced... I have three tables. codeProductscode, codeDistrictratescode, codeDeliverychargescode. In my app, a products delivery will be calculated through a predefined rate defined in the codeDistrictratescode table. If we want, we can also add a custom rate overriding the predefined rate. Each product can have all 25 districts or only some. So heres my solution p  pCreate three tables as I mentioned above. codeDistrictratescode table will only have 25 records for all the 25 districts in my country. For each product, I will add 25 records to the codeDeliverychargescode table with the productID, deliveryrateID and a codecustomcode rate value if available. Some products might have less than 25 districts Only the ones available for that product.p  pI can even store this in a simple hash in one cell in the products table. Like this  codedistrict1 nil, district2 234, district4 543code  Its in Ruby syntax. In here, if the value is nil, we can take the default value from the deliveryrate table. Here also the hash will have all 25 districts But the above method creating a table is easy to work with. The only problem is, it will add nearly 25 records per each product.p  pSo my question is, is this a good thing This is only one scenario... There are more where we can use one simple array or hash in a cell rather than creating a table. Creating a table is easy to maintain. But is it the right wayp

This situation might be a temporary problem that corrects itself when the program runs again. 2. If the file still cannot be accessed and      It is on the network, your network administrator should verify that there is not a problem with the network and that the server can be contacted.      It is on a removable disk, for example, a floppy disk or CDROM, verify that the disk is fully inserted into the computer. 3. Check and repair the file system by running CHKDSK. To run CHKDSK, click Start, click Run, type CMD, and then click OK. At the command prompt, type CHKDSK F, and then press ENTER. 4. If the problem persists, restore the file from a backup copy. 5. Determine whether other files on the same disk can be opened. If not, the disk might be damaged. If it is a hard disk, contact your administrator or computer hardware vendor for further assistance.

All I want is the grid layout to scroll smoothly like default gallary app ,nothing fancy, but the default implementation of grid layout manager scrolls the view in a jerky manner.

So, all I want to ask is can there be some kind of template code which we can implement in LinearSmoothScroller or by extending RecyclerView.SmoothScroller and achieve smooth scrolling  Even if the code depends on number of items and items per row in gridlayout, there has to be some method to do it easily. Am I missing something here p

Negative 308 pSo I have two tables.  One tracking a a persons location, and one that has the shifts of staff members.  p  pStaff members have a staffId, location, start and end times, and cost of that shift.  p  pPeople have an eventId, stayId, personId, location, start and end time.  A person will have an event with multiple stays.p  pWhat I am attempting to do is mesh these two tables together, so that I can accurately report the cost of each location stay, based on the duration of that stay multiplied by the associated cost of staff covering that location at that time.  p  pThe issues I have arep  ol liLocation stays do not align with staff shifts.  i.e. a person might  be in             location a between 1pm and 2pm, and four staff might be on shifts from 1230 to   130, and two on from 130 till 5. li liThere are a lot of records.li liNot all staff are paid the sameli ol  pMy current method is to expand both tables to have a record for every single minute.  So a stay that is between 1pm and 2pm will have 60 records, and a staff shift that goes for 5 hours will have 300 records.  I can then take all staff that are working on that location at that minute to get a minute value based on the cost  of each staff member divided by the duration of their shift, and apply that value to the corresponding record in the other table.  p  pTechniques used p  ol liI create a table with 50,000 numbers, since some stays can be quite long.li liI take the staff table and join onto the numbers table to split each shift. Then group it together based on location and minute, with a staff count and minute cost.li liThe final step, and the one causing issues, is where I take the location table, join onto numbers, and also onto the modified staff table to produce a cost for that minute.  I also count the number of people in that location to account for staff covering multiple people.li ol  pIm finding this process extremely slow as you can imagine, since my person table has about 500 million records when expanded to the minute level, and the staff table has about 35 million when the same thing is done.p  pCan people suggest a better method for me to usep  pSample data Locationsp  precode EventId   ID  Person  Loc           Start                  End   1       987   123     1   May, 20 2015 070000  May, 20 2015 080000    1       374   123     4   May, 20 2015 080000  May, 20 2015 100000    1       184   123     3   May, 20 2015 100000  May, 20 2015 110000    1       798   123     8   May, 20 2015 110000  May, 20 2015 120000  codepre  pStaffp  precode Loc  StaffID  Cost          Start                  End   1   99        40   May, 20 2015 040000  May, 20 2015 120000    1   15        85   May, 20 2015 030000  May, 20 2015 50000    3   85        74   May, 20 2015 180000  May, 20 2015 200000    4   10        36   May, 20 2015 060000  May, 20 2015 140000  codepre  pResultp  pcode EventId   ID  Person  Loc           Start                  End           Cost    1       987   123     1   May, 20 2015 070000  May, 20 2015 080000  45.50    1       374   123     4   May, 20 2015 080000  May, 20 2015 100000  81.20    1       184   123     3   May, 20 2015 100000  May, 20 2015 110000  95.00    1       798   123     8   May, 20 2015 110000  May, 20 2015 120000  14.75codep  pSQL Numbers tablep  precodeWITH x AS     SELECT TOP 224 objectid  FROM sys.allobjects   SELECT TOP 50000 n  ROWNUMBER OVER ORDER BY x.objectid  INTO numbers FROM x CROSS JOIN x AS y  ORDER BY n codepre  pStaff Tablep  precodeSELECT      Location,     ISNULLSUMROUNDCost CASE WHEN DateDiffMINUTE, StartDateTime, EndDateTime  0 THEN 1 ELSE DateDiffMINUTE, StartDateTime, EndDateTime END, 5,0 AS MinuteCost,     CountName AS StaffCount,     RosterMinute  DATEADDMI, DATEDIFFMI, 0, StartDateTime  n.n 1,     0  INTO tempStaffRoster FROM dbo.StaffRoster codepre  pGrouping together, and where help is needed I thinkp  precode    INSERT INTO dbo.FinalTable     SELECT [EventId]           ,[Id]           ,[Start]           ,[End]           ,event.[Location]           ,SUMISNULLMinuteCost,1ISNULLPeopleCount, 1 AS Cost           ,AVGISNULLStaffCount,1 AS AvgStaff       FROM dbo.Events event WITH NOLOCK        INNER JOIN numbers n ON n.n BETWEEN 0 AND  DATEDIFFMINUTE, Start, End       LEFT OUTER JOIN tempStaffRoster staff WITH NOLOCK ON staff.Location event.Location AND staff.RosterMinute  DATEADDMI, DATEDIFFMI, 0, Start  n.n 1 ,     0       LEFT OUTER JOIN SELECT [Location], DATEADDMI, DATEDIFFMI, 0, Start  n.n 1 ,     0 AS Mins, COUNTId as PeopleCount                        FROM dbo.Events WITH NOLOCK                         INNER JOIN numbers n ON n.n BETWEEN 0 AND  DATEDIFFMINUTE, Start, End                        GROUP BY [Location], DATEADDMI, DATEDIFFMI, 0, Start  n.n 1 ,     0                         cap ON cap.Location event.LocationAND cap.Mins  DATEADDMI, DATEDIFFMI, 0, Start  n.n 1 ,     0        GROUP BY [EventId]               ,[Id]               ,[Start]               ,[End]               ,event.[Location] codepre  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pSo I have two tables.

Off the top of my head we accept doc, docx, txt, and rtf documents and possibly others.  The documents must be made available at a later date both in the original format and PDF format.  The developer decided that the best way to accomplish this was by using MS Office interop and letting Word handle the conversion.p  pOn his workstation and on mine it works pretty well, but as soon as the site is published to a server it fails.  It doesnt just fail though, Word opens up and consumes more and more and more memory until it finally locks up the server and the server must be powercycled.p  pI have been beating my head over this for a while now.  Most of the other people online I have found having trouble have reported an error message, but I have not found anyone reporting that the server simply locks up.  And yet, I have observed exactly the same behavior on three different servers.  I tried wrapping the code in a windows service as opposed to an aspx page in IIS and observed the same behavior.  I wrapped the code in a winforms application and it worked just fine.  The essentials can be found belowp  precode    Dim wordApplication As Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.ApplicationClass  New ApplicationClass     Dim wordDocument As Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Document  Nothing     Try         wordDocument  wordApplication.Documents.OpenCTypefileUrl, Object, False, True          If wordDocument IsNot Nothing Then             wordDocument.ExportAsFixedFormatpdfUrl, WdExportFormat.wdExportFormatPDF         End If     Finally         If wordDocument IsNot Nothing Then             wordDocument.CloseFalse             wordDocument  Nothing         End If          If wordApplication IsNot Nothing Then             wordApplication.Quit             wordApplication  Nothing         End If          GC.Collect         GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers         GC.Collect         GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers     End Try codepre  pHas anyone else dealt with an issue like thisp
Negative 308 pI am new to designing games and have been having trouble for the past couple of days with the animator.  I have downloaded a free asset off the Unity store that included a free sprite character and also its animations for idle, walk, run, and jump.  My issue is when I go to use this asset pack in my game, I can not for the life of me figure out how to transition between idlewalk, and any statejump.  I believe it has to do with no parameters being set up, as I want the walk animation to occur when my character is moving.  The issue is that it seems to be stuck in idle mode.  In the animator the transitions are set up, but I can not figure out how to let the animator know when I am moving, and when I am actually idle.  How can I connect my characters movement scripts to be used in conjunction with the animation  Do I need to write a new script, that uses new parameters I make in the animator, or am I completely missing something  Again I am very new at this, so I apologize if this is a dumb question but I cannot figure it out.  All the videos I have watched only show how to build the animations and put them into the animator, and nothing about the scripts or parameters in specific.  Thank youp

Negative 308 pSo, long story short my program receives a raw byte uchar buffer that represents a network packet.  Im trying to parse the information in that packet, and am doing so using the system defined header structures etherheader, ip, ip6, tcphdr, udphdr.  Ive implemented this on both Linux and AIX and it worked, but for some reason I keep getting a Bus Error when I do this on Solaris.p  pThe way that I am getting the data is basically just casting each part of the buffer as one of the structs and reading the data.  For example, if I have p  precodeuchar buffer[]  ...some bytes... struct etherheader ethdr  struct etherheader buffer struct ip iphdr  struct ip  buffer  sizeofstruct etherheader etc. etc. codepre  pI can then get the information I need likep  precodeiphdrgtipv to get the version etcgtetc to get whatever piece of data I need codepre  pNormally, on Linux and AIX this works fine certain structs have different names across systems, but thats besides the point, but upon trying to run this on Solaris, I keep getting a Bus Error when it gets to codeiphdrgtipvcode after codestruct ip iphdr  struct ip  buffer  sizeofstruct etherheadercode .  After some investigation, I found that this is caused by trying to access unaligned memory.  This makes sense because the size of an ethernet header is only 14 bytes, therefore the IP header is not byte aligned within the array.p  pThe way I tried getting around this was to copy the relevant pieces into a separate buffer before I try reading itp  precodememcpyampbuffercopy, buffer  sizeofstruct etherheader, sizeofstruct ip struct ip iphdr  ampbuffercopy iphdrgtipv etc. codepre  pThis works, but I dont understand why.  Why doesnt memcpy throw a Bus Error when it is trying to access the same memory location  I dont like the solution I came up with that much and am trying to better understand the situation so I can come up with something else.  Am I maybe missing a piece of the puzzlep

Negative 308 pIs it correct to assume that the idtoken offers no more security than replacing it with a possibly salted SHA2 hash of itself in any followup communication with the backend serverp  pThe indended flow would be the followingp  ol liThe Android app obtains an idtoken from Googleli liThe app sends the idtoken to the selfhosted backend server, where it is verified by the backend with the use of gitkitclient.VerifyGitkitTokenli liThe backend creates a SHA2 hash of the token together with the expiry date and the associated user id, and stores it for future reference in a lookup tableli liThe Android app creates the same SHA2 hash of the idtoken and passes it along in the header in any future communication with the backend, instead of using the idtoken for the followup communication.li ol  pDoes this decrease in any way the security of the systemp  pIf a transparent proxy with https inspection and the according certificates installed on the device, ie legitimately in a corporate environment would sniff the traffic, it would make no difference if the idtoken is obtained or the SHA2 hash of it, that transparent proxy would be able to act possibly in a rouge way on behalf of the Android app for the entire lifetime of the idtoken, rightp  pMy issue is that calling gitkitclient.VerifyGitkitToken on every followup communication with the server is too expensive, and not necessary once the validity of the idtoken has been ascertained.p  pI also dont want the idtoken to be stored on the server for future reference, instead prefer having a hash of it. Is a SHA224 hash of the idtoken enough and is it safe to assume that it would not result in any collisionsp
Negative 308 pIm trying to obfuscate my Ionic code. Every question or post about uglifying angular.js code, tells that you should use annotated syntax for dependency injection, something that after obfuscation looks like thisp  precodeangular.moduleApp .controllerMyCtrl, [scope, state, functiona,b  ...] codepre  pBut Id like to experiment with not using this approach and still obfuscating the code by including angular.js in the obfuscation phase, so that angular providers would also be mangled and the code would look like thisp  precodeangular.moduleApp     .controllerMyCtrl, functionaX,bZ  ...] codepre  pWhere following the first example aX is the mangled name for scope and bZ correspond to the state provider.p  pThis approach would make it harder for someone who knows AngularJS trying to understand your code, since angular.js is also obfuscated I mean, providers lost their original meaningfull names.p  pI have joined ionic.js  angular.js  myfiles.js and passed that thru Uglify2, but only got errors on running the app, mostly related to the angular injector service, but also about window been undefined and the like.p  pstrongHas anyone done that before Any working examplesstrongp

Negative 308 pI currently have no ideas for what code I could use, nor if it is even possible but I have been asked to find out for work. I work for a broadcasting company and they have bought a raspberry pi as a experimental thing. They want to use it to attach to monitors and screens at festivals and other jobs they do. None of the other workers here even have the slightest idea how to work python 3 so its up to me to get a network set up between a windows 7 home premium pc and their raspberry pi. I have looked at some Youtube videos of various people trying to do this but each one says something different and it has confused me further. Please get back to me if anyone has a definitive answer. Thank you  p
Negative 308 pI wrote an App which will create Shortcuts for other Apps on the Homescreen. It works with every App I have tested, except with one. For this one App no Shortcut is created.

Negative 308 pIts pretty straightforward to add different lproj folders with all the images to my development pod which show up fine in my workspace.p  pIf I then want to use different images for different languages I have to add the languages to the codeInfocode tab of the codePodscode project first, if I do this and localize all the images everything works fine.p  pBut of course as soon as I do a codepod updatecode the codePodscode project gets recreated and the localization is lost.p  pIs there a way to tell the podfile to recreate the project with multiple localization languagesbr Or is there another way to have multiple images for different languages inside a cocoapodp

Negative 308 pIve been struggling with combining backbone, require and jquery mobile. I have a very simple use case with a router which instantiates a view, which in turn instantiates subviews. The controls being rendered by the views have valid jquery mobile markup so they ought to be jquery mobile rendered. Furthermore Ive made an attempt to implement an autocomplete control but it seems like the filterablebeforefilter isnt fired. In other words it seems like all the jquery mobile stuff has been ignored when injecting the backboneview.p  pI thought this would be pretty straightforward and it probably is but so far Ive been unable to get this to work s what am I doing wrong herep  pThis is what my initial stuff looks likep  pHeres the index.htmp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml langengt     ltheadgt         ltmeta charsetutf8gt         ltmeta nameviewport contentinitialscale1.0, widthdevicewidthgt         ltlink hrefcssjquery.mobile1.4.5.min.css relstylesheetgt         ltscript srcjslibsjqueryjquery1.11.3.min.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscript srcjslibsjquerymobilejquery.mobile1.4.5.min.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscript datamainjsmain srcjslibsrequirerequire.jsgtltscriptgt     ltheadgt     ltbodygt         ltdiv idwrappergt             ltdiv idheadergtltdivgt             ltdiv idcontentgtltdivgt             ltdiv idfootergtltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  p... and a routersnippetp  precodeapprouter.onroutehome, functionid     var view  new SearchView     view.render  codepre  p... the searchview backboneviewp  precodedefine [      jquery,     underscore,     backbone,     text....templatessearchsearchviewtemplate.htm,     viewssearchsearchboxview ],      function , , Backbone, Template, SearchBoxView           var SearchView  Backbone.View.extend              el content,             template .template Template ,             initialize function                  this.render             ,             render function                  this.el.html this.template                  this.searchbox  new SearchBoxView                 this.el.append this.searchbox.render                  return this                                return SearchView       codepre  p...and finally the searchboxviewp  precodedefine [     jquery,     underscore,     backbone,     messenger,     text....templatessearchsearchboxtemplate.htm ],     function , , Backbone, Messenger, Template           var SearchBoxView  Backbone.View.extend              el searchbox,             template .template Template ,             initialize function                  this.listenTo Messenger, searchsuggestions, this.populate                  this.render             ,             events                  filterablebeforefilter autocomplete request,                 click searchbutton search             ,             render function                      this.el.html this.template                      return this             ,             search function                  var input   autocompleteinput ,                     value  input.val                 Messenger.trigger searchsearch, value              ,             request function e, data                   var input   data.input ,                     ul   autocomplete ,                     value  input.val                 if value ampamp value.length gt 2                       Messenger.trigger searchsuggest, value                      ul.html ltligtltdiv classuiloadergtltspan classuiicon uiiconloadinggtltspangtltdivgtltligt                      ul.listview refresh                               ,             populate function suggestions                   var ul   autocomplete ,                     html                   ul.html                   .each suggestions, function i, suggestion                       html  ltligt  suggestion  ltligt                                   ul.html html                  ul.listview refresh                  ul.trigger updatelayout                                 return SearchBoxView        codepre

Negative 308 pI have a codeFormcode with the following propertiesp  ul liBackground Imageli liScrollable codePanelcode with a transparent background, and codeDock  DockStyle.Fillcodeli licodePictureBoxcode with a large codeWidthcode and codeHeightcode which shows scroll barsli ul  pNow all controls are set to DoubleBuffered including the form itself. Everything works as expected except when scrolling the Panel for the PictureBox, the form background image scrolls with it repeating itself showing vertical and horizontal tearing although its static image that fits the forms size, and when you stop scrolling it shows properly. This only happens when dragging the scrollbars, if i click on any point in the scrollbars to move it, it shows properly.p  pAs per my understanding Double Buffering should eliminate such cases, but even with double buffering its the same, maybe a little bit better but still its a huge problem when scrolling.p  pI tried to place all controls inside another panel instead of using form background image and place this panel on the form but it didnt make any difference.p
Negative 308 pOkay so I have this table with a lot of rows 3 million from which I need to query some of them at seeral points in my app.p  pThe way I found to do this is querying all the data the first time that any was needed and storing it in a codestatic DataTablecode with codeSqlAdapter.Fillcode for the rest of the app life.p  pThis is fast, because then when I need something I use codeDataTable.Selectsome querycode and the app processes the info just nice.p  pThe problem is that this table takes about 800mb of RAM usage, and I have to run this app in PCs where it might be too much.p  pThe other way I though was to make a query only of the data I need each time. This takes little memory but has poor performance a lot of queries to the database, which is at a network and with 1000 queries you start to notice the ping and all that...p  pIs there any intermediate point between performance and memory usagep  pEDIT What Im retrieving are sales, which have a date, a product and a quantity. I query by product, and it isnt indexed that way. But anyways, making 1000 queries, even if the query took 0,05s, a 0,2s ping makes a total of 200seconds...p
