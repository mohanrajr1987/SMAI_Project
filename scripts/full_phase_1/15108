But when they enter matching passwords and resubmit the form a second time, the csrftoken contains the token value but requestcsrftoken is blank.  This was confirmed by the fact that request.POST[csrfmiddlewaretoken] is not in the request.POST dictionary when the user resubmits the form.  I dont understand why this is happening.p  pThis form worked perfectly well in Django 1.6 but its stopped working in 1.8 or possibly 1.7.  I looked through the 1.7 and 1.8 release notes and didnt see any changes to the CSRF functionality.  I also read the template docs that pertain to CSRF and didnt see anything new there.  Doing an online search on this error didnt turn up anything either.p  pI suspect that some of you will suggest that I use the djangoregistrationredux library.  I dont think I can use it due to my registration workflow.  You see, after the user registers on this form, theyre redirected first to a page when they enter their user profile, then to a page where they can upload a photo, and then to a page to review and approve their profile and photo.  After that, theyre forwarded to my payment processor.  Theyre only truly registered with a valid account if my payment processor tells me their payment method has been approved.p  pThanks.p

However, when the user selects the date range and hits apply the form fields arent updated.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThe form Im using looks like thisp  precodeclass DateRangeFormforms.Form   def initself, args, kwargs     initialstartdate  kwargs.popinitialstartdate     initialenddate  kwargs.popinitialenddate     requiredval  kwargs.poprequired      superDateRangeForm,self.initargs,kwargs     self.fields[startdate].initial  initialstartdate     self.fields[startdate].required  requiredval     self.fields[enddate].initial  initialenddate     self.fields[enddate].required  requiredval    startdate  forms.DateField   enddate  forms.DateField codepre  pThe view they are used in looks like thisp  precodedef tablesearchrequest   initialstart  20152   initialend  2015222   message  lasturltablesearch    if request.method  POST     daterangeform  DateRangeFormrequest.POST,requiredTrue,initialstartdateinitialstart,initialenddateinitialend    else     daterangeform  DateRangeFormrequiredTrue,initialstartdateinitialstart,initialenddateinitialend     searchdict.updatedaterangeformdaterangeform    return renderrequest, InterfaceApptablesearch.html, searchdict codepre  pThe Django template herep  precodeltdiv classcontainergt   ltform actionInterfaceApphome methodpost classformgt    csrftoken      ltdiv classdaterangepickercontainer mcastsearchfiltergt         ltdiv classdaterangepickerlabelgtDate rangeltdivgt         ltdiv iddaterange classdaterangepickercontentgt              bootstrapform daterangeform              lti classiconcalendar iconlargegtltigt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt   ltformgt ltdivgt ltscriptgt      the startdate and enddate are the ids that django form fields created     daterange.daterangepicker         locale            format YYYYMMDD         ,         startDate daterangeform.startdate.value,         endDate daterangeform.enddate.value      ltscriptgt codepre  pstrongEDIT 2strongp  pAnd the forms currently look like this after ShangWang suggestion renderedp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com8vKuq.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8vKuq.png altenter image description herea a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comkiBzt.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkiBzt.png altenter image description hereap  pIs there a way to display it so the start and end date fields show up  I tried changing the div class so it wasnt hidden, and then they showed up but seemed superfluous.p

Negative 15108 pA bit long, but, shorter than the first draft p  pWe have a small VB.net application that basically pulls information from our dBase and then exports this information to an .xls file.  From this .xls file, in house agents then manually update a third party listing service which maintains our current inventory with the information contained within. The information is very basic, consisting of, for ease of discussion, a Part Number, a Description and a Quantity On Hand.p  pNormally we update this information once a week, but, a newly revised contract with this listing service now requires a daily update to maintain our platinum vendor status.p  pThe problem is that it can take quite some time to manually update this information.  Therefore, an automated process is in dire need.  And I have finished most of the groundwork and coding  up to a point.  Hence the question, and hence where I get stuck.p  pThe listing service has provided us with the following WSDLs One for Increasing our Inventory, one for Decreasing our inventory, one for Adding inventory and one for Removing Inventory.p  pUp to this point, I have reprogrammed a Stored Procedure that was generating the exported information.  this SP now does some internal math to figure out if a transaction result occurring on yesterday was an Increase, a Decrease, an Add or a Remove.  These results are then added to a result table under a newly created column named SERVICE.  This new information is then pulled from the dBase with vb.net and imported into a Data Table for analysis.p  pWith this Data Table, I can now loop through each row, looking in the column SERVICE and depending on the information contained in that cell, call the appropriate web service.p  pI have added all the web references to my project and created the Proxy classes for each web service.p  pSecond problem is, I have no idea how to actually call the actual web service.  The following is a small snippet of the codep  precode loads data into the AviationDataBaseResult.ILSARRAY2 table.  Me.ILSARRAY2TableAdapter.FillMe.AviationDataBaseResult.ILSARRAY2   Start the looping process For Looper  0 To RowCount  1      If Me.AviationDataBaseResult.ILSARRAY2.RowsLooper.ItemService           Increase Then          Call Appropriate Web service     End If  More If..Thens ensue, one for each service Next   More code ensues codepre  pI realize that this has become quite long winded, mostly because on any given day I have 25 FF tabs open and none of them agreeing with each other.  To add another wrinkle the WSDLs in question use a lot of complex types within complex types with, you guessed it, other complex types entwined.  I have looked over many examples, and have yet to find one that deals with complex types and how to handle them.  Any help on pointing me in the right direction on where to go to find what I need to know is greatly appreciated.p  pIf any other information is required, Id be more than happy to provide you with as much as I can.  If my thought process and logic is illsuited to do what I need to do, Im more than happy to hear that as well.  Being relatively new to vb.net, I have become quite adept at consuming humblepie.p  pThanks for your time.p

Negative 15108 pI have a live database on a shared hosting server. I am making some major changes to my sites code and I would like to fix some stupid mistakes I made in initially designing the database. These changes involve altering the size of a large number of fields, and enforcing referential integrity between tables properly. I would like to make the changes on both my local test server and the remote server if possible.p  pI should note that while Im fairly comfortable with writing complex queries to handle data, I have very little experience modifying database structure without a graphical interface.p  pI can access the remote database in the visual studio database explorer but I can not use that for anything other than data manipulation. I installed Sql Management Studio express last night and after 40 crashes I gave up  I couldnt even patch the damn thing.p  pThe remote server is SQL 2005  The MyLittleAdmin web interface is available. So my question is what is the best way to accomplish these changes. Is there a graphical interface I can use on the remote server If not is there an easy way to copy the database to my local machine, fix it, and re upload  Finally if none of the above are viable does anyone have links to a decent info on fixing referential integrity via queryp  pSorry for the somewhat general question  I feel like I am making this far harder than it should be but after searching  trying all night i havent gotten anywhere. Thanks in advance for the help. I really appreciate it. p  p...Also does anyone have a time machine I can borrow I need to go kick my past selfs ass for this.p

Negative 15108 pI must admit to having only a rudimentary understanding of how HashTables work, although from what little I do know it seems fairly straightforward. My question is just this it seems that the conventional wisdom is to use simple, basic value types such as integers for the keys in a HashTable. However, strings are also often used, even though in many languages they are implemented as reference types. What I feel is generally emnotem encouraged is using complex reference types Im guessing this is because doing so would necessitate a slower hash function But then why are strings so commonly used After all, isnt a string internally a char[] array again, in most languagesp  pIn the end, what value types are generally regarded as the best or even simply acceptable choices to use as keys in a HashTable And are there any commonly used choices that are actually regarded as bad like strings, possiblyp

Negative 15108 pI have some C code which is using CSharpCodeProvider.CompileAssemblyFromSource to create an assembly in memory.

The pathToPublicKey string is the path to a pubic key of our particular signing certificate.  p  pUsing the code in a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkb323809httpsupport.microsoft.comkb323809a its pretty straight forward to verify that the pathToBinary file is in fact trusted by the operating system.  p  pNow Im in the same place as the writer of question 1072540, I know the OS trusts the signer of this binary, but I want to know if my organizations RSA key is the one that signed the binary.  p  pThe KB323809 shows how to extract the strings from certificate embedded in our binary file. This example shows how to extract strings from the signing certificate in its GetProgAndPublisherInfo function, but Im uncomfortable using a string match to verfiy the certificate.p  pWhat I would like to do is extract the public key from the embedded signature and compare it to the public key that corresponds with the private key that signed my binary file in the first place.p  pThe documentation for CryptMsgGetParam says that the CMSGSIGNERCERTIDPARAM parameter Returns information on a message signer needed to identify the signers public key.

Anyway, standard disclosure that I have searched everywhere and banged my head on the keyboard and cant figure this out.p  pIm building a basic app based on the utility application template with a MainViewController and FlipsideViewController. Side note I still dont understand the purpose of MainView and FlipsideView in this scheme so if someone can explain it that wouldnt be too terrible Dp  pAnyway, at the bottom of both of these views I want to have a toolbar. It was easy enough to add that to a given view with IB, but I want the toolbar to have its own controller and model because I want to keep its state consistent across the two views. Accordingly Id like to load that view from a nib but it seems Im doing something wrong. I followed the advice here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1726250nsviewcontrollerandmultiplesubviewsfromanibhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1726250nsviewcontrollerandmultiplesubviewsfromaniba but obviously borked it up so more insight would be appreciated.p  pI did the following things I created ToolBarViewController which is basically empty but is the file owner of ToolBar.xib. Inside ToolBar.xib I have a view with a frame the size of the toolbar and inside that a toolbar. In MainView.xib Ive got a view element of the same size which is wired up to toolBarView found in the code below...p  pIn MainViewController.hp  precodeimport ToolBarViewController.h  interface MainViewController  UIViewController ltFlipsideViewControllerDelegate, MKMapViewDelegategt   ...

The adorner attaches itself to a specified framework element.p  pThis functionality is invoked when the user clicks on a button that is located in the upperright corner of the grid named NavigationGrid.  The button containins an icon of a pushpin.  This functionality removes the NavigationGrid grid from its parents children, and adds it to the children of the LayoutRoot grid.  The adorner allows the user to be able to drag the grid around the screen.p  pIf the user clicks on the pushpin button again, the intended functionality is for the grid to be removed from the LayoutRoot children, and to be added back to its original parents children, with the Grid.Column, Grid.RowSpan etc. values.p  pThe problem I am running into is when the NavigationGrid grid is initially removed from its parents children, all of the other elements in the grid resize etc.  This is ok, as it is what I wanted.  But, when the grid is placed back into its parents children, its location is not the same as it was originally.  I checked the Margin property, and it is set to 0.  So, because its location is not identical to its original location, I programatically set its margin to a negative value that puts it back visually to where it was originally.  This throws off the location of the other elements, and everything begins to overlap etc.p  pSo, my question is, does anyone know how I can achieve this functionality such that the NavigationGrid grid can be removed from its parent and later placed back into its parent, with its original placementlocation being in tactp  pThanks.p  pChrisp  pBelow is a screenshot of the UI.  For obvious reasons, I have blacked out certain parts of the UI.  The grid on the left, with the label Processes, is the grid that the user should be able to unpin and move around, which does work, its the functionality that places it back in place that creates the

Negative 15108 pI have a Windows Server 2008 machine iis7 that has CopSSH set up on it. To connect to it, I have a Windows 7 machine with Mercurial 1.5.1 and TortoiseHg installed.p  pI can connect to the server using PuTTY with a nonstandard ssh port and a .ppk file just fine. So I know the server can be SSHd into.p  pNext, I wanted to use the CLI to connect via hg clone to get a private repo. Ive seen elsewhere that you need to have ssh configured in your mercurial.ini file, so my mercurial.ini has a line codessh  plink.exe ssh C l username P  i CProgram FilesPuTTYKey FilesKyleKey.ppkcodebr Notebr codeusernamecode is filled in with the username I set up via copSSH.br codecode is filled in with the nonstandard ssh port Ive defined for copSSH. p  pI try to do the command codehg clone sshinthom.comcode but I get this errorbr coderemote bash inthom.com command not foundbr abort no suitable response from remote hgcodep  pIt looks like hg or plink parses the hostname such that it thinks that inthom.com is a command instead of the server to ssh to. Thats really odd.p  pNext, I tried to just use plink to connect by codeplink P  sshinthom.comcode, and I am then prompted for my username, and next password. I enter them both and then I get this errorbr codebash sshinthom.com No such file or directorycode  p  pSo now it looks like plink doesnt parse the hostname correctly.p  pI fiddled around for a while trying to figure out how to do call hg clone with an empty ssh field and eventually figured out that this command allows me to reach the server and clone a test repo on the inthom.com serverbr codehg clone sshRepostestcodep  pcodecode is the character Ive found that lets me leave the hostname blank, but specify the repo folder to clone.p  pWhat I really dont understand is how plink knows what server to ssh to at all. neither my mercurial.ini nor the command specify a server. None of the codehg clonecode examples Ive seen have a codecode character. They all use an address, which makes sense, so you can connect to emanyem repo via ssh that you want to clone.p  pMy only guess is that it somehow defaults to the last server I used PuTTY to SSH to, but I SSHd into another server, and then tried to use plink to get to it, but plink still defaults to inthom.com verified with the v arg to plink. So I am at a loss as to how plink gets this server value at all.p  pFor fun, I tried using TortoiseHg and can only clone a repo when I use codesshRepostestcode as the Source.p  pNow, you can see that, since plink doesnt parse the hostname correctly, I had to specify the port number and username in the mercurial.ini file, instead of in the hostname like usernameinthom.com like youd expect to. Trying to figure this out at first drove me insane, because I would get errors that the host couldnt be reached, which I knew shouldnt be the case.p  pMy question is how can I configure my setup so that sshusernameinthom.comRepostest is parsed correctly as the username, hostname, port number, and repo to copy Is it something wrong with the version of plink that Im using, or is there some setting I may have messed up If it is plinks fault, is there an alternative tool I can usep  pIm going to try to get my friend set up to connect to this same repo, so Id like to have a clean solution instead of this codecode business. Especially when I have no idea how plink gets this default server, so Im not sure if hed even be able to get to inthom.com correctly.p  pPS. Ive had to use a ton of different tutorials to even get to this stage. Therefore, I havent tried pushing any changes to the server yet. Hopefully Ill get this figured out and then I can try pushing changes to the repo.p

My app runs entirely offline except for this one purchase  so Im hoping theres a simple solution without having to implement tons of net code.p  pBasically, if I try to connect to make an inApp purchase with a device that is not connected to the internet, the timeout is ridiculously long 5 minutes on the SKProductsRequest.  My app is a free demo app, with only one purchase, so allowing the purchase to occur in the background is not ideal, as the user would be stuck in the app with limited functionality while they wait for the timeout explanation that they have no network connection.p  pIs there any easy way to test if the App Store is available on the device  [SKPaymentQueue canMakePayments] does not help here.  The code solutions I have seen have been extremely complicated.p  pIdeally, I would want to check this when a user enters the buydemo screen and I would pop up an alertview saying no network is available.p  pThanksp

Negative 15108 pI am writing a short and simple profiler in C, which is intended to print out stack traces for threads in various Java clients at regular intervals. I have to use the undocumented function AsyncGetCallTrace instead of GetStackTrace to minimize intrusion and allow for stack traces regardless of thread state. The source code for the function can be found here a hrefhttpdownload.java.netopenjdkjdk6promotedb20openjdk6srcb2021jun2010.tar.gz relnofollowhttpdownload.java.netopenjdkjdk6promotedb20openjdk6srcb2021jun2010.tar.gza in hotspotsrcsharevmprimsforte.cpp. I found some man pages documenting JVMTI, signal handling, and timing, as well as a blog with details on how to set up the AsyncGetCallTrace call http jeremymanson.blogspot.com200705profilingwithjvmtijvmpisigprofand.html.p  pWhat this blog is missing is the code to actually invoke the function within the signal handler the author assumes the reader can do this on hisher own. I am asking for help in doing exactly this. I am not sure how and where to create the struct ASGCTCallTrace and the internal struct ASGCTCallFrame, as defined in the aforementioned file forte.cpp. The struct ASGCTCallTrace is one of the parameters passed to AsyncGetCallTrace, so I do need to create it, but I dont know how to obtain the correct values for its fields JNIEnv envid, jint numframes, and JVMPICallFrame emframes. Furthermore, I do not know what the third parameter passed to AsyncGetCallTrace voidem ucontext is supposed to bep  pThe above problem is the main one I am having. However, other issues I am faced with include  [1] SIGPROF doesnt seem to be raised by the timer exactly at the specified intervals, but rather a bit less frequently. That is, if I set the timer to send a SIGPROF every second 1 sec, 0 usec, then in a 5 second run, I am getting fewer than 5 SIGPROF handler outputs usually 13 [2] SIGPROF handler outputs do not appear at all during a Thread.sleep in the Java code. So, if a SIGPROF is to be sent every second, and I have Thread.sleep5000, I will not get any handler outputs during the execution of that code.p  pAny help would be appreciated. Additional details as well as parts of code and sample outputs will be posted upon request.p  pThanksp

Attempted to make use of MultiBinding however that is firing on instantiation and therefore the converter then fires accordingly. It does NOT fire when I click compare and the compare command is executed.p  pWith that not working, I am attempting to now reference the controls within XAML to pass within an ArrayExtension. Not sure of the syntax or if it is even possible as I know you cannot bind within the ArrayExtension. The above fails since it can not construct a new CompareTextView view, which has no default constructor since I am making use of Prism...p  pPretty frustrating, hopefully someone can help me out...p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pWant to clear some things up. The issue is not that I want CanExecute called again. The issue is that at instantiation of the controls, the converter is called and executed and the values are returned...but where they go I have no clue The converter is never called again. If I could get the initial references to the FlowDocument this would all be a moot point...but it doesnt return things anywhere per se...since this is a command...if that makes sense...when making use of MultiBinding.p  precode        ltButton xNameCompare CommandBinding CompareCommand HorizontalAlignmentCenter VerticalAlignmentTop Width75 ContentCompare Grid.Row2 Grid.ColumnSpan2gt         ltButton.CommandParametergt             ltMultiBinding ConverterStaticResource FlowDocumentConvertergt                 ltBinding ElementNameOrigText PathDocumentgt                 ltBinding ElementNameModifiedText PathDocumentgt             ltMultiBindinggt         ltButton.CommandParametergt     ltButtongt codepre  pstrongUPDATEstrong p  pTried what refereejoe mentions a hrefhttpcompositewpf.codeplex.comThreadView.aspxThreadId47338 relnofollowherea, scroll down a little bit to see his posting. While CanExecute continually fires, this does nothing to resolve the issue. In addition I switched the MultiBinding to be a single item, it is coming back null. Again when the converter fires on instantiation the FlowDocument references are there...p  pstrongANSWERstrongp  pAbes mention that it was being cached led me to try something else. Since I knew that the FlowDocument references were available when the converter was called I knew they were there. Something was getting fouled up. The key piece appears to be in the converter itself. I was simply returning the object[]. Then when the command fired the arg was indeed an object[] but the two items were null. I created a class called Docs, which had two properties, one for each FlowDocument reference. When the converter fired I set the properties appropriately and then returned the Docs object. Now when I initiated the compare command, the Docs object was the args and it had the reference to the FlowDocuments just as I needed Not sure if this is by design, but the fact that the items get lost when using the object[] doesnt make sense to me.p

Negative 15108 pIm a newbie to VTK and am starting to write a medical viewer.  Ive seen that VTK wraps into either Java or QT and was wondering if anyone has an opinion about which one works better.  Im much better at Java, and would be learning QT from scratch.  However, Ive read and noticed that getting VTK and Java to play nice can be problematic.  For example my first hello world Java VTK program took a long time to write because I had to modify the system path to get Java with VTK to run.  This alone might be problematic down the road because the computers Im deploying on have very strict security regulations.  But on the other hand, Id be learning QT from scratch.p  pAny ideas or opinions would be much appreciated.p  pThanksp

Negative 15108 pI have a user control, call it MyUserControl.  MyUserControl is made up of a single grid with one row and multiple columns.  There is a single textBox in each column and each columns width is set to .p  pNow I added three instances of MyUserControl to a grid in another control myUserControl1,2,3.  What I want to do is link the column widths of some of the columns in the MyUserControls to each other.p  pWhen I type in a textBox in one of the MyUserControls, the textBox width grows automatically if the text entered is longer the current textBox width.  I want the corresponding columns in the other MyUserControls to expand as well.p  pFor example, I type in a textBox in myUserControl1 and the columns in myUserControl2 and myUserControl3 expand as well.p  pI tried updating the ColumnDefinition widths of the other controls and that works fine.  The problem is that once I set the width of a ColumnDefinition, it loses its star sizing capability.  As a result, if I later resize the window, the columns no longer fill the available space.p  pIn a nutshell, I want to be able to set a grid column width to a specific size and have it retain its star sizing capability so that if I am typing and a textBox grows wider, the other control columns grow wider to match.  If I then resize the width of the window, the columns expandcontract as if star sizing was enabled for those columns but maintaining the correct textBox width I guess I would have to mess around with the MinWidths of the columns as well.  p  pIs this doable or am I barking up the wrong tree  I want the columns in the separate MyUserControls to always be the same size.p  pPlease let me know if the question is not clear and I will try my best to make it clearer.p  pThanks.p

Negative 15108 pHow do I apply jQuery plugin effects to items that are created by an eventp  pSo, what I am attempting to do is have all uls throughout a site use the jquery.scroll.js plugin for styling. I currently have it working on all active uls. However, there are some categorysubcategory sections. I am still new to writing any jQuery on my own and there is a leap in logic that I dont understand on applying plugins to items when they are loaded later.p  pIn the real example, users click a category from a ul and a sub category is loaded via Rails and JSON. For a light sample, I made a jsfiddle that simulates the issue that I run into.p  pThe category ul is styled correctly, but the subcategory ul doesnt pick up the styling. Im hoping for some assistance not just in whipping up some code to fix it, but in pointing me in the direction of what I need to learn for this functionality.p  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netdandenney25R8F1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netdandenney25R8F1ap  pThank you in advancep
Negative 15108 pIve got a number of stored procedures made with the MySQL Workbench. They work just fine when use MySQL workbench to put them into my test DB. p  pNow I am preparing the DB creation scripts for deployment, and this is the only one giving me trouble. When I use the command line  mysql shell, the script works perfectly well to. Its only when I use the PHP mysqli interface to execute the script  it fails. Without comment.p  pI use the procedure creation scripts as MySQL workbench generates for me that is, it has this patternp  precodeSET OLDUNIQUECHECKSUNIQUECHECKS, UNIQUECHECKS0 SET OLDFOREIGNKEYCHECKSFOREIGNKEYCHECKS, FOREIGNKEYCHECKS0 SET OLDSQLMODESQLMODE, SQLMODETRADITIONAL codepre  pat the start of the script, then repeating for each procedurep  precodeDELIMITER  USE dbname CREATE PROCEDURE procnameIN inputparameters BEGIN codepre  p... procedure goes herep  precode END DELIMITER  codepre  pThis script works fine if run from MySQL Workbench. It also runs fine if I try the same from mysql commandline. But it fails to accomplish anything when I execute it through the PHP mysqli interface  executing it with mysqlimultiquery, which works fine for the other scripts creating and populating the DB. There is no error returned on the interface, no results . All I get is false, and thats it. error code is at 0, no error message.p  pIts a big WTF for me, and I hope you can point me in the right direction  how can I fix this and install the procedures from PHPp  pPS rootadmin access is given and verified after all, I just created the DB with the very same connection, created users, inserted tables and so on.p

Negative 15108 pI have a server process whos job it is to monitor various Web Services.  The web services are all hosted on a SharePoint farm, and end up using NTLM authentication in the underlying HttpWebRequest methods.p  pAll of my initial connections work just fine, and I can see the typical challengeresponse traffic in fiddler.p  pAfter a while, however, if the SharePoint farm servers are bounced while my monitoring service stays up the next time my application tries to connect to the same web services, I get HTTP 401 Unauthorized responses.p  pThis happens once, and then if my monitoring service connects again, everything works and the connections go through just fine.p  pFrom what I can tell by tracing this through, the initial connections are all getting challengedauthorized properly and the NTLM tokens are being cached in my monitoring process for each unique web service URL.  At the point where the SharePoint servers are bounced, those NTLM tokens are no longer valid.  However, my process has to hit one failure before those tokens in the cache are thrown away, after which the challengeresponse dance happens again and everything works.p  pSo, my question is this is there a way for me to force the NTLM tokens to be removed from the cache so that I can avoid the 401 unauthorized responsesp  pI realize that I dont want the challengeresponse extra overhead every time I make a web service call.  But there is a clear starting point in my periodic monitoring where it would make sense to clear the cache and pay the challengeresponse penalty once, so that all subsequent requests go through fine without the 401 unauthorized error.p

Negative 15108 pI have a sidebar on a WordPress site that lists a number of posts with audio files. When a user clicks on a play button in that sidebar, the associated audio file should load in a popup window that also shows a title for the audio being played. At the moment, Ive placed the JS script inside the loop, but the popup is only loading whats last in the loop... The user clicks on the top audio link in the sidebar but gets the bottom one, basically.p  pI have an idea of why this happens, because the PHP runs on the server first, and the JS popup is just grabbing the latest item in the PHP loop. But Im stuck... how do I make the popup grab the right audio posts info Many thanks in advance for an answer.p

Negative 15108 pI am unclear on how to handle the following scenario...p  pAssume that you have a ViewController that needs to perform a long running operation.  The ViewController calls performSelectorInBackground to start the long running operation, which in turn will call performSelectorOnMainThread when it is done.  Now, assume that the View gets deallocated during the long running operation, perhaps because the user navigated backward in the UINavigationController.  When the background operation completes, it is going to try to send a message to a deallocated object.  p  pWhat is the best way to handle this It is in my requirements that the user must be able to abandon the screen during the operation, so preventing the backward navigation is not an option.p

Negative 15108 pOkay, this one is hard to classify for me because I dont know the solution yet. p  pThere are these credit card statements that I have to download from my banks website, but the crazy thing is that they have one separate pdf file for each month  thats like 60 files for last 5 years  and I need to go through all those transactionsp  pSo, being lazy as I am not to just download them one by one, I was wondering if I could write a script or a simple program that can just download these files once I have the browser window open. p  pNow the key is this  the program cannot directly make an http call to the banks website, because this window is behind an account authorization screen, after a few clicks to get to credit card statements. What I want to do, is just open the window, and then run some program, and voila, all the files are downloaded. p  pAnd just for some superkicks, it would be awesome if the program could read those pdf files, parse the tables in the pdf and put them into a spreadsheet or something  if someone tells me how to do that in a few hours, youll get some serious respect and love.. but even the above should be good enough..p

Negative 15108 pI have a third party library that Im attempting to incorporate into a simulation.  We have the static library .a, along with all of its runtime dependencies shared objects.  Ive created a very simple application in C that is linked against the library.  All it does is call an initialization function that is part of the third party librarys API, and exits.  When I run this directly from the command line, it works fine.  If I submit the executable to our Condor grid, it fails with a seg fault on strncpy libc.so.6.  Ive forced condor to only run the executable on a particular machine, and if I run it directly on that machine, it works fine.p  pIm mostly a Java programmer...  limited amount of native coding experience.  Im familiar with tools such as nm, ldd, catchsegv, etc... to the point where I can run them.  I dont really know where to start looking for an issue though.  p  pIve run ldd directly on the executing machine, and via a script submitted through condor, along with my executable.  ldd reports the same files in both cases.p  pI dont understand how running it directly would work, but it would fail being run by condor.  The process that ultimately executes the program, condorstartd, is a process that starts as root, and changes its effective uid to the submitter.  Perhaps this has something to do with itp

Negative 15108 pI would like to draw a simple 2D stickman on the screen. I also want it to be antialiased.p  pThe problem is that I want to use a bones system, which will be written after I would know how to draw the stickman itself based on the joints positions. This means I cant use sprites  I want my stickman to be fully controlable in the code.p  pIt would be great if it will be possible to draw curves too.p  pDrawing a 3D stickman using a model would also be great if not better. The camera will be positioned like its 2D, but I would still have depth. The problem is that I only have experience in Maya, and exporting and vertex weighting of the model in OpenGL seems like a mess...p  pI tried to find libraries for 2D antialiased drawing or enable multisampling and draw normally, but I had no luck. I also tried to use OpenGLs native antialiasing but it seems deprecated and the line joins are bad...p  pI dont want it to be too complicated because, well, it shouldnt be  its just the first part of my program, and its drawing a strongstickmanstrong...p  pI hope you guys can help me, Im sure you know better than me p

Negative 15108 pIm using a WebView to display some locally stored HTML.

Visually, I can get partway there by applying various a hrefhttpcssinfos.netpropertieswebkit.php relnofollowCSS stylesa, in particular, setting appropriate values for codewebkittouchcalloutcode and codewebkittaphighlightcolorcode will make the links appear as normal text. I can then set a custom codeWebViewClientcode which overrides codeshouldOverrideUrlLoadingWebView view, String urlcode returning true to prevent the WebView loading the URL.p  pFor touch access, this works fine and certainly gives the impression that there are no links in the page.

After installing php and configuring some things i stuck right now at configuring intl and icu.p  pAfter a while i recognize, intl is a standard extension delivered in the win installer of php. Unfortunately, they use icu 3.8 and MediaWiki recommanded to use a newer version. p  pBecause i quite new in MediaWiki i try to install all recommandations. p  pi found the new icu.dll in the web a hrefhttpsite.icuproject.orgdownload48 relnofollowdownloadlinka but not the intl.dll. Copying the 7 files icu48.dll in the directory where the old icu38.dll files placed wont work. I understand why this is so because i suppose, the dll needs the file names.p  pSo the question is, where can i get a newer version of intl.dll with newer version of icu or can i compile a intl.dll with icu 4.6. By the way, Im not a compiling crack. p  pThank you verry much Frankp

Negative 15108 pHi Im working with a view pager and fragments. I would like to override orientation changes so that the onCreateView method isnt run everytime the orientation changes. This is because a lot is run in onCreateView for my app which causes the orientation to be slow to change. Also things on my server are checked and what not too so there really is no reason for all of it to run just because the orientation changed. p  pHere is what ive set up so farp  pI have this on the MainActivity in the manifestp  precode androidconfigChangesorientationkeyboardHidden codepre  pAnd then i am using this in my fragmentp  precodeOverride public void onConfigurationChangedConfiguration newConfig    super.onConfigurationChangednewConfig     getLayoutInflatergetArguments.inflateR.layout.main, null, false     Toast.makeTextgetActivity, changed orientation, Toast.LENGTHLONG.show  codepre  pWhen i run the app and switch orientation i see the toast show but the layout never changes to the landscape one. So I decided that maybe android just wasnt recognizing that it was in landscape since i overrided it but changing the layout to something ridiculous like a layout for a dialog doesnt cause a force close or anything it stays the portrait layout which is stretched as a result so i know there is something wrong with how im inflating the layout.p  pAny help on changing the layout when orientation is changed in a viewpager would be greatly appreciated.p  pThank youp

Negative 15108 pOne major barrier to creating immersive experiences in the browser using WebGL and similar is the set of limitations placed on mouse control. p  pFor instance a first person shooter control scheme essentially requires the program to grab the mouse and recenter it so as to allow infinite movement in any direction for the cursor. This is a nono because it would give the web programmer too much control. Hopefully one day we will see a plugin that allows a site to request permission to move the mouse to allow this behavior. p  pHowever I think there are some ways to improve things without going that far. I am wondering if its possible to allow access to the mouse position once the mouse moves off of the window focus is still on window p  pI was playing this game using Google Chrome a hrefhttpwww.chromeexperiments.comdetailxwingf relnofollowhttpwww.chromeexperiments.comdetailxwingfap  pand my biggest issue was that to get to a corner, I have to carefully keep my mouse on the corner of the browser window. If I push it off the window my ship would stay where the mouses last window position was, which is not exactly in the corner. And I would crash into the wall. p  pTo make this better, the browser should be able to receive mouse updates when the mouse is outside of the window. In the context of this type of game if the mouse leaves the window it should continue to send updated positions to the browser. p  pIs there any provision for this p

Negative 15108 pI am studying new features of JDK 1.7 and I just cant get it what MehodHandle is designed for I understand direct invocation of the static method and use of Core Reflection API that is straightforward in this case. I understand also direct invocation of the virtual method nonstatic, nonfinal and use of Core Reflection API that requires going through Classs hierarchy codeobj.getClass.getSuperclasscode. Invocation of nonvirtual method can be treated as special case of the former one.p  pYes, I aware that there is an issue with overloading. If you want to invoke method you have to supply the exact signature. You cant check for overloaded method in easy way.p  pBut, what is MethodHandle about Reflection API allows you to look on the object internals without any preassumption like implemented the interface. You can inspect the object for some purpose.

According to it, the main goal is to simplify life for scripting languages that runs atop of JVM, and not for Java Language itself.p  pstrongUPDATE2strong I finish to read the link above, some quotation from therep  blockquote   pThe JVM is going to be the best VM for building dynamic languages, because it already is a dynamic language VM. And InvokeDynamic, by promoting dynamic languages to firstclass JVM citizens, will prove it.p      pUsing reflection to invoke methods works great...except for a few problems. Method objects must be retrieved from a specific type, and cant be created in a general way.lt... p      p...reflected invocation is a lot slower than direct invocation. Over the years, the JVM has gotten really good at making reflected invocation fast. Modern JVMs actually generate a bunch of code behind the scenes to avoid a much of the overhead old JVMs dealt with. But the simple truth is that reflected access through any number of layers will always be slower than a direct call, partially because the completely generified invoke method must check and recheck receiver type, argument types, visibility, and other details, but also because arguments must all be objects so primitives get objectboxed and must be provided as an array to cover all possible arities so arguments get arrayboxed.p      pThe performance difference may not matter for a library doing a few reflected calls, especially if those calls are mostly to dynamically set up a static structure in memory against which it can make normal calls. But in a dynamic language, where every call must use these mechanisms, its a severe performance hit.p blockquote  pa hrefhttpblog.headius.com200809firsttasteofinvokedynamic.htmlhttpblog.headius.com200809firsttasteofinvokedynamic.htmlap  pSo, for Java programmer it is essentially useless. Am I right From this point of view, It can be only considered as alternative way for Core Reflection API.p

Negative 15108 pI have been toying with http authentication using the .htaccess file in an attempt to better my current cms.p  pI have found a solution in apache whereas, I use a link in my html somewhere codelta href.testgtTestltagtcode.p  pI then add this to my .htaccessp  precodeltFiles .testgt AuthType Digest AuthNAme Restricted Page AuthDigestProvider file AuthUserFile usrhomemyDomainincludeshtpasswdadmin.htdigest Require validuser  If user is authenticated then redirect RewriteEngine on RewriteCond REMOTEUSER  RewriteRule . test.php [R] ltFilesgt codepre  pWhat this does, is when a user clicks on the mentioned hyperlink, the user is then prompted with a login form via http authentication. When they enter the correct credentials, they are redirected to a page in the accessable root called test.php, which in turn includes the cms index that is held out of the web root. p  pIf a user selects a section within the cms, they are prompted to log in again using the sites default php based log in system and only users with the correct role assignments may access any specfic section.p  pAlthough this is useful, it is not quite what i am trying to accomplish.p  pWhat i have thought of, is two possible solutions in my case.p  pOne would be where a user could enter say codehttpwww.myDomain.comwhateveryoulikecode in the address and be directed to my cms instead. Ideally this redirection would direct straight to my cms index in its root directory that is not accessable via codehttpcode. Something like this which can be done in phpp  precodeif issetGET[whateveryoulike]   include SERVER[DOCUMENTROOT] . ....adminblah.php  codepre  pAnother option i thought of would be something i do not know very much about, but it relates to http authentication and i have seen in use once before...p  pBasically the user enters usernamewww.myDomain.com and they get prompted with the http auth log in box. When the credentials are met, they are sent to a seperate section within the website.p  pWould anyone be able to provide any input, suggestions or addittional ideas relating to how i would go about thisp  pMy question though, is if it is possible to actually catch a GET codehttpwww.myDomain.comwhateveryoulikecode apply http authentication then redirect the user to a page that is held out of the codehttpcode rootp  pThank you for taking the time to read through thisp

Negative 15108 pIm currently developing a backend for chefs at various restaurants to report their daily menues in a structured format.

I was planning to create a editor plugin which displays the field for the chefusers and parse the indata into a structured dataformat e.g. XML. For each week I will need to create empty templates for all the restaurants displaying the week number and dates. p  pI was also hoping for thirdparty developers to access this data through RESTful methods in the URL where the structure could be something like a hrefhttpdomain.norestaurantnamemenu relnofollowhttpdomain.norestaurantnamemenua for a textmenu a hrefhttpdomain.norestaurantnamejson relnofollowhttpdomain.norestaurantnamejsona for json etc.p  pI guess my question is how I can start developing such features. Has there been developed anything similar and are there modules developed for Joomla which I can utilise Does my approach sounds sensible or are there any other good way of solving my problem p

Shouldnt they make it codeReentrantcode or this is the default behaviorp  pIs this scenario will continue failing cause they already have an unexplained reference not set to an instance of an object if the WCF service is down from the client I believe using multithread operations in a WCF service consume by ASP.NET project which relies on IIS handling is bad cause the page could be sent to the client before the WCF service return data to the client class library and append these to the page. Can you discuss the above and explain your thoughtsp  pShouldnt be better when you need such an asynchronous programming style to inform WCF comsumers to notify after long operation using codeCallbackContractscode and embedded WCF technologies, rather multithreading operationsp  pNeed clarification to correct the design and have some proves that this is a bad service architecture, if it is for real, which I suspectp  pThank you.p

Negative 15108 pI was wondering how we would be able to find the current location of the element in the browser. I am  trying to create a jQuery slider. Have created sliders by animating margins earlier. But this case is bit complicated. It has two navigations. one that will slide from one page to other. One page has four thumbnails. And using the bottom navigation you can slide through only one thumbnail. Please refer to the image below.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9GKl3.png altsliderp  pI have been able to get this effect earlier by animating the margins. But it isnt very efficient and has a lot of bugs. So I thought I would rather do it from scratch again.p  pNow what I am planning to do isp  ol liWith the arrow navigation, animate the margin and go to next slide.li liwith the pagination, find out the current location of the thumbnail and animate margin equal to the width of article  gutter.li ol  pIs it possible to do it using jQuery offset Please suggest me the right way. Any examples of sample code will be highly appreciated. p  pThanks in advance.p  h2EDITh2  pI have actually finished the slider. It is working perfectly as I wanted. I will answer to this question in few days. Also when the site is completed I will share the link so others can see it in action. p

Negative 15108 pI have an annoying problem with importing data using Visual Studio in Sql Server. I created an SSIS import package with Visual Studio to import an Excel file .xlsx. The sheet I import has a column populated with datetype values. Some values are left aligned, some are right aligned. If I format the entire column as datetype, I still get the two different types of alignment on that column e.g. 412011 is right aligned, 13012011 is left aligned. I import the file with nvarchar for that column and I get NULL values for the left aligned values. If I import the file with datetime datatype for that column, I get NULL values for the right aligned.p  pI dont care how the information lands in my Sql database, either as nvarchar or datetime, but I need the complete information, without the NULLS. This seems an Excel issue mostly, as the Excel does not see the values as being of the same datatypes, hence the different kinds of alignment. Any suggestions please Grateful for any advicesuggestions. Thank you.p

Negative 15108 pI am trying to create a .NET API which wraps and interfaces with a thirdparty C API. As such the semantics of the API are as followsp  pThere is a property which represents a list of strings in a binary file. There is a distinction to be drawn between this property having a list with zero entries, in which case the property will be written to the file with an empty list and the list being omitted altogether, in which case the property will be omitted from the file.p  pIn my current design, Im using something like thisp  precodepublic class InfoWrapper       Use an IListltTgt to avoid running afoul of FxCop      rule CA1002 Do not expose generic lists.     public IListltstringgt ItemsContainer  get set   codepre  pThis would do the trick, of course, allowing me to distinguish between the not set and empty list cases, but the real problem is that it triggers another FxCop warning, CA2227 Collection properties should be read only. I need to be able to allow the user to set the property to a codenullcode value, and potentially back to a list if they change their mind after setting it to codenullcode. I could make the property readonly, with a pair of methods say, codeDeleteItemsContainercode and codeCreateNewItemsContainercode, but in reality, I have several of these properties I need to handle the same way. Adding two methods per property is going to clutter up the API considerably. What would be a better approach herep  pN.B. I realize I could just suppress the FxCop warning and be done with it, and that those rules are just one set of suggestions. However, Id like to stay within those guidelines if possible.p

Negative 15108 pI was reading about anemic domain model is a antipattern and I had some questions about. I have a database where three clients uses and each one of them has diferrents business rules to insert a product into database.

Isnt it goodp  pMy second argument is if I have a desktop and a web application using the same rich domain model, how can I know when to throw a HttpException and when to throw some desktop exception Wouldnt it better to separate it So, finally, why an anemic domain model is an anti pattern in a situation like this in my projectp

Negative 15108 pSo I have SVN installed on our web server. The idea is that the working copies are loaded on developer machines and when they commit conflicts asside the server executes a postcommit bash.p  pRepositories are per project based, the idea is that upon postcommit, the bash file needs to force delete the entire project folder and files, and export the updated repo back into the project folder, to keep the website updated via SVN... I know theres bound to be some disagreements with this method but it works for us... except for ONE thing...p  pWhile the server is reexporting the project, any requests being made to the website raise errors since theres chunks of files missing... Is there any way to queue apachephp while SVN exports, and then resume the requestsp  pThe server exports the files pretty quickly but its those few millisecs that someone catches the server and raises PHP errors...p  pPlease let me know if theres a typical method to sort this out...p  pThanksp

Negative 15108 pSay I have a specialized subclass of codeJDialogcode called codeBrushListDialogcode within which I have a codeJListcode. The list uses a custom list model which extends codeDefaultListModelltStringgtcode and a custom cell renderer which extends codeDefaultListCellRenderercode. For readabilitys sake, I nested these classes within the main class.p  pNormally, Id make these classes static which I emdidem do for the cell renderer, but the list model class has the following methodp  precodeprivate boolean showRemoveConfirmDialogObject elem      int option  JOptionPane.showConfirmDialogBrushListDialog.this,             elem   is a default brush type.nDo you want to allow the removal of such entries,             Remove, JOptionPane.YESNOOPTION, JOptionPane.WARNINGMESSAGE     if option  JOptionPane.YESOPTION          TYPES.clear         return true          return false  codepre  pAs you can see, it relies on the toplevel classs instance for determining the codeJOptionPanecodes display position. codeBrushListDialog.thiscode, of course, cannot be called within a static context, and therefore the nested class cannot be static.p  pI see three ways of handling this using codenullcode for the first parameter in codeshowConfirmDialogcode is not an optionp  ol liKeep the cell renderer static, but make the list model an inner class for the sake of being able to call codeBrushListDialog.thiscode.li liMake both nested classes static, and pass the current codeBrushListDialogcode instance through the list models constructor.li liUse Swing utility methods to go through the components and find an instance of codeBrushListDialogcode this is hacky in my opinion.li ol  pSo I ask you is keeping the list model nonstatic for the sake of being able to access the parent dialogs instance worth itp  pa hrefhttpsgist.github.com4250287 relnofollowSource code for the two nested classesap

Negative 15108 pSome methods of stdlist, and probably other STL containers, have a new overload added in C11. The one I need is listsplice. One method takes a listamp parameter, the other one takes a listampamp parameters.p  pId like to know what the difference, and which ine I should prefer.p  pI looked at the implementation of libstdc the standard C library used by the GCC compiler and it uses the listampamp version in both cases internally. Also the C11 specification says nothing about this issue. It just offers 2 methods without explaining the difference.p  pYou dont move the list itself, and you dont move the nodes copying their pointers seems like the way to move nodes from one list to another, so why does it matter I have just one idea, maybe using listampamp is like a promise to the compiler you dont need the other list anymore and the the compiler can save a few operations because it doesnt have to keep the other list valid...p

O one of my main concerns is how to store and retrieve dates from the database SQLite and compare them.p  pThe way I do it in PHP is I simple I use the codetimecode function, which creates a unix timestamp for the current time, and then I store it as an integer in a MySQL database. This makes things very simple and easy due to MySQLs date functions, as well as the ability to easily retrieve and compare the date via PHP as an integer.p  pSo basically, Im wondering what the best solution would be for Java. What do you recommend I do when creating, storing, retrieving, and comparing dates for my future Android appsp  pHere is an example of the PHP code Id use, perhaps this will give someone a better idea of what Im used to and what Im looking forp  precodeDatabase structure id int auto increment username varchar thedate int  ltphp  username  scarhand77 thedate  time   insert into database  mysqlqueryinsert into stackoverflow username, thedate values username, thedate   retrieve from database  userdate  mysqlresultmysqlqueryselect thedate from stackoverflow where usernameusername, 0   compare userdate, see if its older than right now  if userdate lt time     echo it is older else     echo it is not older  gt codepre  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 15108 pIm looking for some advice on logging. Ive written a wrapper called codeLoggercode  which internally uses a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff632023.aspx relnofollowMicrosoft Enterprise Library 5.0a. Currently it enables us to log in this wayp  precodeLogger.ErrorLogCategory.Server, Some message with some state 0, state codepre  pThe problem I face is that every log in the EventViewer seems to be unrelated even though emsome of themem are somehow related, for example they all come from processing a request from a particular client.p  pLet me elaborate on the problem. Suppose Im working on a service which needs to handle requests from multiple clients at the same time, each passing different set of parameters to the service methods. Few of the parameters emcan be usedem to identify the requests, such as emwhichem client is making emwhatem kind of request with emwhatem uniquely identifiable parameters, etc. Say these parameters are call the contextual informationp  ul liServerProfileIdli liWebProfileIdli liRequestIdli liSessionInfoli ul  pNow the service started processing the requests, doing one thing after another like a workflow. In the process Im logging localsup1sup messages such as emfile not foundem or ementry not found in DBem, but I dont want to emmanuallyem log the above information the contextual information with every log, rather I want the logger to log them automatically every time I log local messagep  precodeLogger.ErrorLogCategory.Server, requested file not found codepre  pAnd I want the above call to log emthe contextual informationem along with the message emrequested file not foundem so I can relate the message with its context. p  pThe question is, how should I design such a logger wrapper which logs contexts automatically I want it to be flexible enough, so that I may add more emspecificem contextual information along the way the service processes the request, as all the important information emmay not be availableem in the beginning of the requestp  pI also want to make it configurable, so I can log the local messages emwithout logging the context informationem, as theyre not needed when everything works great. p  hr  psup1. By emlocalem message I mean the messages which is more specific, local in nature. By contrast, I would say, the contextual informations are the emglobalem messages, as they make sense for the entire flow of processing a request.supp

But when I was in, any action on any page threw out the user versus the login page, with not session variables anymore somewhere. p  pEverything was fine for me, the session path was writable, the sessions were correctly settled and till the first page the sessions were dispayed correctly at the begin and and the end of the html code.p  pAfter 1 day going crazy I discovered that for every single error in a page css file not found or image not found the session got lost. So, one, by one, I correct those errors wich is very good by the way and now the site is working again.p  pMy question is where I can configure a linux server behaviour such these, saving and writing sessions even if there is some error in the programmingp  pI would like to know it because if the shared hosting works like that, means that somewhere there is a directive to do that... an I cant find anything till now.    p

Negative 15108 pSo I am trying to speed up my databasedriven website and I came across memcached which I can apparently use to cache frequent keyvalues from the database in the memory. My question is, how can data be forced to stay in the memory, because normally if the server is running other application, there is a possibility that the memcached hashtable or part of it will be written back to the hard disk if a page from another application replaces a page from the memcached. So in industry, do they have separate machines that only run the memcached or do they tweak the operating systems internals so that pages from the memcached wont be swapped outp  pThe question can be generalized to any other application, knowing how to force data to stay in the memory can be very beneficial.p

So in the appropriate method in appdelegate, I open the database, fetch the entities I want and change the properties in the objects I want. Now, this works, I manage to open the database and get the objects I want From the database. p  pMy problem occours when Im done changing data from the database in the appdelegate. Because after the appdelegate method is completed, I try to refetch data in the tableview from the same database, but at this point of time the database hasnt registered the changes made in the method called in the appdelegate. Ive tried calling the saveToURL for overwriting method on the UIManagedDocument right after the changes are made inside the appdelegate and ive also tried the save method on the managedobjectcontext.  Whats the right way of saving the changes so that database gets updatedp  pPs Im writing this on an iPad, so I havnt managed to upload code, Ill upload it later.p  pThanks p

Negative 15108 pI have a codeforeachcode loop inside of an buttonclick event handler that Im using to get rid of controls that all sit on the same point on the Y axis.  I have a control that adds a row, and then I need users to have the option to remove a row they didnt mean to add.p  pWhen I use the codeforeachcode loop by itself, it consistently misses two itemsthe same two every time. Ive confirmed that the Y values are in fact identical. If I keep running the function, it removes all the controls on the row after three runs.  However, if I nest the codeforeachcode loop, using all the same values, it works.  See the code below.p  pThis seems like a pretty sloppy way to do it, but its also the only solution that has worked for me. I saw a couple other posts that said to declare a second variable within the loop i.e., codeControl z  c  ifz.Location....code.  That didnt make any difference in the behavior here.

Negative 15108 pI started looking into Dapper just recently.

However if I do that, I wont be able to query a product with its category info, more than just the category Id.p  pSo without resorting to raw Dapper, how can I do an insert and update using a class with a navigation property I was hoping I can do the following and tell Dapper.Rainbow to ignore codeCategorycode when inserting or updating.p  precodepublic class Product      public int Id getset     public string Name getset     public ProductCategory Category getset     public int CategoryId getset  this will be the same field name in the database  codepre  pThis scenario is possible with NHibernate where I can have a proxy object of codeCategorycode and assign it to codeProductcode and save it and the mapping works perfectly.

Negative 15108 pIve been playing around with node and websockets and built a small test app that streams audio using websockets.

On the client side I pick up the chunks on the websocket and use decodeAudioData a hrefhttpwww.html5rocks.comentutorialswebaudiointro relnofollowhttpwww.html5rocks.comentutorialswebaudiointroa to decode and play the chunk. It all works relatively ok.p  pWhat I was curious to do next was to stream video in the same manner to the HTML5 video tag. But I cant really find any reference material on the web to achieve this in the same manner as my audio test above. p  pIs there a video equivalent for decodeAudioData p  pCan I feed chunks of data into a video tagp  pIve got a similar sample running that I picked up from...p  pa hrefhttpsgist.github.compaolorossi1993068 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.compaolorossi1993068ap  pBut this isnt really what I am looking for. First of all it doesnt really seem to be streaming to me. The client buffers it all before playing it. Also, similar to my audio test I want the stream to be throttled on the server side so that when a new client connects they join the video at whatever point it is currently at. i.e. 30 minutes in or whatever.p  pThanksp

Negative 15108 pI have a distinct feeling Im getting way over my head again. A few months ago I built a system that search through code and made modifications using reflection. This worked nicely, now Im trying to rebuild the system and generalise some aspects of it a little. One thing Id like to do is be agnostic to the changes that might have gone on in the most recent bit of computation.p  pSo, for instance, lets say Im executing a Mario program and we press a button. The games state has changed, but we dont know how. I want to reverse this effect so I can go back in time and press a different button. My plan isp  ul liExternalize all the game classes that may have had some effect applied to them. Store the value of all nonfinal fields, including static values.li liWrite out all game objects using extern.li liMake the change.li liWrite out all game objects using extern in case we want to jump back to this state laterli liRead the prechange state back in again.li ul  pOn the face of it, is anything going to explode in my face here Is this a sound idea Or will some static fieldstrange behaviour mess me up For externalization I am literally planning on asking for a list of all fields via Reflection and writing them out in iteration order, so as not to miss anything.p  pMods  I used the tag serialization as externalization isnt an existing tag. Hope thats ok.p  pEDIT  I wont need the value of local variables, or the stack or heap just yet. This may be a  consideration later though  particularly the existencenonexistence of objects which may have been destroyed between changes.p  pEssentially, I need to reverse a general computation step. no idea if this is possible.p

Negative 15108 pI was looking through the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiJavabytecodeinstructionlistingsJVM bytecode instructionsa and was surprised to see that all the interactions between classes e.g. casting, codenewcode, etc. rely upon constant pool lookups for identity of the other classes.p  pAm I correct in inferring that this means that one class cannot know about the existence of more than 64k others, as it is impossible to refer to them  If one did need to refer to that many, what ought one dodelegate the work to multiple classes each of which could have their own lt64k interactionsp  pThe reason this interests me is that I have a habit of writing code generators, sometimes producing thousands of distinct classes, and that some languages e.g. Scala create classes prolifically.  So it seems that if true I have to be careful if I have hundreds of methods in a class each using hundreds of distinct classes, I could exceed the constant pool space.p

Negative 15108 pI am working on a REST api.  Receiving a POST message with bad JSON e.g.  sdfasdfasdf   causes Spring to return the default server page for a 400 Bad Request Error.  I do not want to return a page, I want to return a custom JSON Error object.p  pI can do this when there is an exception thrown by using an ExceptionHandler.  So if it is a blank request or a blank JSON object e.g.   , it will throw a NullPointerException and I can catch it with my ExceptionHandler and do whatever I please.p  pThe problem then, is that Spring doesnt actually throw an exception when it is just invalid syntax... at least not that I can see.

Negative 15108 pI have a codeUITableViewCellcode that is implemented using storyboard that looks likep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwF2sk.png altenter image description herep  pHere is what the cell should look like without an imagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0KTMF.png altenter image description herep  pI have been fiddling with the constraints and banging my head trying to figure this out but have had no luck.  I have a pretty good understanding of constraints and how to add them programmatically but have had no luck with this specific problem and feel like I am just adding layout constraints to the cell willynilly with no logical thought process.  The cell represents a newsfeed post which may or may not have an image in the main image view at the top, and should behave as follows.  If the cell doesnt have an image in it the bottom bar with the like and comment counts, moves up to align with the top of the cell.  I achieved this behaviour by setting a constraint that kept the smaller image view, post title, post time and the post content a set distance away from the bottom of the cell.  This approach works and when the cell is resized in the codeheightForRowAtIndexPathcode method the subviews move appropriately.  The problem comes when the text in the post content is larger then a single line.  The height of the cell adjusts correctly but the top of the text view stays at the same location and grows downward and overflows into the next cell.  When I place the constraints to align the four subviews with the top of the cell I run into issues when there is no image and the post content is larger then a single line.  In this case, the cell resizes to be smaller than its original size and the subviews stay at the distance specified by the constraint. The smaller image, post title, time and content are clipped and dont display.  This is such an odd problem with so many different cases.  I have been working at this for almost two days and could really use someone elses thoughts on how to solve this issue.  I hope this isnt too confusing, thanks for the helpp

Negative 15108 pI have a MySQL table that will need to store about 200 million records on a daily basis. The data comes in flat files that I will be bulk uploading using LOAD DATA INFILE.

Negative 15108 pOur group frequently has situations where we need to join our tables against identifiers that come from outside of the database, e.g. downloading data with matching associations found in a public data repository.p  pI know of basic two approaches. The one we most commonly use involves batching IN clauses. We have a utility for transparently wrapping long IN statements in separate queries when we are joining against 1000 items.p  pWith 5 items and batch limit of 4 the query p  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeSELECT foo.id, foo.data FROM foo WHERE foo.id IN MANY codepre  pbecomesp  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeSELECT foo.id, foo.data FROM foo WHERE foo.id IN ,,, SELECT foo.id, foo.data FROM foo WHERE foo.id IN  codepre  pThis method works but seems quite kludgy. p  pThe alternative sometimes employed involves creating temporary tables, inserting the values, and joining against the normal tables.  This solution seems a bit more standard with respect to the final query as youre simply joining as you would if the data were in your database.  However, the temporary table creation doesnt seem to be something that can done in an ANSI SQL compliant way.p  pPerformance seems to be about equal with the IN method winning favor with few external values as expected.p  pWhat is the best practice for solving this problem in an ANSI standard wayp  pEdit With respect to performance measures, we were benchmarking the application code. This included the overhead of inserting into the temp tables. Likewise, for the IN clauses it included the overhead of batching them. p

Negative 15108 pContinuing from a simple program I started writing the other day, I have a fresh query. I would like the program to draw a black circle in the middle of a panel. Later on I will use buttons to move the circle but Im not on that stage yet.

Negative 15108 pI recently finished building my own version of a lightbox using HTML5, CSS, and jQuery. At the core of it, jQuery basiically just adds the entire lightbox to the current displayed page. I say this to make it clear that Im not using any sort of fancy devices such as prototypes or iFrames. I was also able to add comments to the lightbox and thats where the problem comes in.p  pI want the comments to be separate for every image. Meaning, users should be able to commenton each individual image, not the whole gallery itself. The problem Im having is that the facebook comments only record commnets for the whole page. So, while in the lightbox, the comments dont refresh when I go to the next image. p  pIve tried passing the individual picture URl to the datahref attribute that facebook requests but that didnt work. I really dont know what to do...p  pFrom my understanding, and much searching thru google, the comments need to be linked to an individual page URL. I can see where the problem comes in it asks for html page urls but Im passing them picture urls. p  p1 Should i use an iframe and load the picture in there, then pass iframe url to the datahref attribute 2 Should i try using prototypes i dont even know what those are or if they would even apply to my case lolp  pBasically how do I tell facebook to save comments linked to an individual picture and not the entire html pagep  pP.S. This is like, my third time posting the same similar question so I decided not to put the code up again... I did before, no one answered and this time I felt there was no need to waste the space. Everything about the code works tho except for the comments for every image. If someone wants to see the code, however, just ask and Ill put it up.p  pThanks in advancep  pstrongemSOLUTION UPDATEemstrong I managed to get this to work. It turns out facebook thought ahead and made it so their comments can be linked directly to an image and not just a .html file. For any struggling adventurers out there like me here is what you have to do 1 Set datahref originally equal to the absolute URL of the image that the user clicks on 2 When the user clicks previousnext, update the datahref of the comments to reflect the change in picture and call the following method right afterp  precodeFB.XFBML.parse codepre  pThat method basically refreshes the comments plugin and makes it display the updated comments. That was my problem. In theory, my code was working the whole time, I just wasnt reparsing it. I added that line and it works like a charm.p  pFor anyone interested, you can check out the rough framework of the lightbox here a hrefhttpshakazulu.hosted.melightboxlightboxPractice.html relnofollowhttpshakazulu.hosted.melightboxlightboxPractice.htmlap  pDont judge, its just a practice domain I use to try things out. I will try to keep that code up there as long as I can as I noticed its very hard to find something similar on Google.

First I did a checkout of the original branchp  precodegit checkout brancha codepre  pThen, I deleted the branch thinking all the changes I made would get deleted toop  precodegit branch d branchb codepre  pSo the branch gets deleted but when I go back to codebranchacode to continue work from where I left off, I see the changes I made in codebranchbcode are still there. Since I didnt commit anything before, I cant figure out how to separate the changes precodebranchbcode and postcodebranchbcode. Is this still possiblep  pAnd in terms of the process, is there a better way to create and delete test branches E.g. should I have used codegit reset hardcodep
Negative 15108 pI have an Android application that reads a lot of chunks of bytes one by one via network, then combine them into a large buffer.

Negative 15108 pI have written a code, where the user selects a profile picture and then the picture is stored in codelocalhostuserusernamephotosphoto1.gifcode.p  pAfter that, I assigned the filename codephoto1.gifcode into a session variable so I can display it from all my php scripts. This is working just fine. I can display the picture in every php script by accessing this session variable.p  pThe only problem I have is when I am trying to login from the login page In the login page I connect to the database, retrieve email and password, check them and if they are OK I redirect the user to codehome.phpcode. The problem is that the users photo is not linked to the email so i cannot know the filename of the photo. The only thing I know for sure is the directory because I can retrieve username from database as well.p  pLets say that a user has uploaded 4 photos photo1, photo2, photo3, photo4  photo4 was uploaded last. It makes sense that he is currently using photo4 as my profile picture. Is there a way for me to access that folder and retrieve the filename of the picture uploaded lastp  pAlso, as a general question, what is better, store the photosor files in a database or serverp
Negative 15108 pAt the moment I create constants in this wayp  precode Constants.h FOUNDATIONEXPORT NSString const kTestConstant   Constants.m NSString const kTestConstant  TestConstant codepre  pThis of course works fine, however Im puzzled on why I cant just have it all in the header file like thisp  precodeNSString const kTestConstant  TestConstant codepre  pIf I do that, include Constants.h in various classes and use kTestConstant in those classes, I get redefinition errors at compile time. Why is thatp  pMy theory is that by having a constant only on a header file, the file Constants.h is copypasted into the class files that import it, consequently I end up with two copies of kTestConstant. However, by using an implementation file, that file is compiled and linked with the classes that import Constants.h. Is this more or less correctp

Negative 15108 pIm currently working on a tiny Sublime Text plugin that involves controlling a Chrome instance with Selenium. One of the features Im working on is live reloading of styles. The idea is to reload the CSS on the browser through Selenium any time you make a change on any of your CSS files. p  pI can easily reload the browser, but I dont want to do that, because its rather slow, and maybe you have some input on the page, which would be lost. Ideally I would like to force Chrome to reload all styles without reloading the page. Since I can inject JavaScript code into Chrome with Selenium, it suffices an answer using JavaScript only, I can deal with the Selenium part. However, if there is some Seleniumspecific way of doing this, even betterp  pI would rather not depend on jQuery or any other external libraries for this, but if needed, I can live with that also.p  pFor the time being, I dont need compatibility with any other browser than Chrome 31, but if there is a crossbrowser compatible solution, it would be a plusp  pstrongEDITstrong After reading a few answers to similar questions, I want to add a few constrainsp  ul lipIm not writing the HTML, so I cannot change the way styleheets are added, or the order, neither can I expect them to have a specific id, or anything like that. I can inject any JavaScipt I want, but I cannot control how the HTML was generated in the first place.pli lipI dont want to append codevrandomcode or anything like that, because I dont have control over the server either, so I dont know if the server will look at that and do something different. Besides, I would not like to circumvent the caching, if the server responds code302code and the browser caches, then Im OK with that.pli lipIf possible, I would like the solution to work also for programatically injected CSS as far as is possible, since the page may be using some CSS AMD loader, or any other Ajax stuff. Ideally, I would like to say to Chrome please reapply all CSS as abstract as possible, instead of relying on finding all codelinkcode tags and such, because those solutions always have a gotcha.pli ul  pJust to clarify, I know these are kind of hard constrains, but Im developing a plugin for a text editor, so I need to cope with every technologyweb frameworkmethodology the developer is using, so I cannot trust too much that the developer will follow certain patterns. Of course, I would like to cope with as many situations as possible, but Im willing to drop unrealistic constrains if necessary. However, I do can force developers to use a specific version of Chrome, at least for developing.p  pAs of now, none of the answers Ive found on SO so far provide this level of developmentagnosticism. p

Negative 15108 pAs part of my training for my new contract position, I have been tasked with building two DLLs and two cppunit Unit Test programs.  Everything built successfully.p  pWhen I tried to run one of the Unit Test programs, I discovered that both of the DLLs which are used by the Unit Test programs have mixed 32bit and 64bit elements.  I downloaded Dependency Walker Depends.exe and trace the issue where the DLLs were getting their inputs.  32bit libraries are in a directory called CAppNamebin and 64bit libraries are in CAppNamebin64.p  pSince DLLS are not loaded until runtime actually load time and since DLLs that are not in the same directory as the .exe, and since PATH shows the search order for those two folders as CAppNamebin64CAppNamebin, when I tried to run the Unit Test, I got an error telling me that there were 64bit modules mixed in with 32bit modules, and refused to run.  I fixed this issue by renaming bin64 to SAVEbin64, so that the loader would be unable to find it, default to the other directory, and load the correct DLLs.p  pMy office mate received the same task.  He had no such difficulties.  Not only that, but I had previously gotten the program to run successfully, but encountered the issue after I had installed some modules using the corporate installation facility.  Since the installations occurred in the background, I had no idea what it did, other than foobarring my builds.p  pSomething in the Visual Studio C unmanaged build process had included sufficient information into the .exe to let the loader know where to find the correct DLL, but got bollixed up when I did the install.p  pI did extensive research on this issue before finally discovering the cause by turning on Full Paths in Depends.exe, so I have already learned about SxS SidebySide and DLL Redirection, neither of which is relevant here.p  pSo, the question is, how did the Windows loader find the correct DLLs one time, but not another how did the loader find the correct DLLs on his machine, but not minep  pThanks in advance.p  pEdited to addp  pI tried one more experiment.  With my bin64 still renamed to SAVEbin64, I built both libraries libB.dll is dependent on libA.dll and the Unit Test programs both dependent on libB.dll as 32bit.  Then I renamed SAVEbin64 back to bin64, so that if the loader is completely dependent on the PATH variable for locating dependent DLLs, the Unit Test program should fail to run, due to 3264bit mismatches.  However, the Unit Test program ran, successfully finding one error out of 72 modules.p  pThis demonstrates that the Visual Studio 2010 C compilerlinker was somehow able to embed the proper locations for dependent DLLs into the executable program, so that the loader did not have to rely on the PATH variable to find the DLLs.p

Negative 15108 pI have a Sharepoint Library, which I have a Powershell script dropping files into for processing. The Powershell script reaches out to Active Directory, and returns Group Membership information. The script then creates a folder for the group owner if it doesnt exist in my Library, using the group owners name, and drops a .CSV of all the users contained in the specific group into that folder.p  pThe need here, is to grant Read permissions only to the owner of the group, which will be the name of the folder we are working in. Ideally the folder would be hidden, however I understand that there are limitations when working with Sharepoint. p  pFor examplep  blockquote   pJohn Doe, User jdoe would be able to access ZjdoeIT.csv but not   ZsomeuserHR.csvp blockquote  pI have my Sharepoint Library mapped to Z currently, to make my life easier for Powershell.p  pI executed codegetcommand  Module Microsoft.SharePoint.PowerShell  ft namecode and ran through the list of Sharepoint Commands. p  pI then stumbled across the codeGrantSPObjectSecurity Cmdletcode, which I assume is what I would want to use on the Powershell side to, when the folder is being created, apply Sharepoint permissions only to the user for which the folder is being created for. p  pThe process from start to finish is Powershell Script GetGroupMembers executes, reading a text file containing an Active Directory Group name, per line. For each group found, the script identifies the owner of the group, creates a folder named with the owners AD name, and puts a .CSV file in the folder listing all members of the group. Then, I for now anyway manually initiate the next Script ImportCSV which pulls all the information into a Sharepoint list for an unrelated process. p  pHope that helps understand whats happening. Am I right in assuming I should handle this on the Powershell side, as opposed to the Sharepoint side If so, am I headin in the right direction with codeGrant SPObjectSecuritycodep  pThanksp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pFollowing the link I provided in a comment below, here is what I came up withp  precodefunction GrantUserpermissionstrOwnerName          [Microsoft.SharePoint.SPUserCollection]spusers[Microsoft.SharePoint.SPUserCollection]web.SiteUsers     [Microsoft.SharePoint.SPUser]spuserspusers[strOwnerName]          Strowner name   strOwnerName           Get the SPWeb object and save it to a variable         web  GetSPWeb identity WebURL         if strOwnerName ne null                       sproleassnewobject Microsoft.SharePoint.SPRoleAssignment[Microsoft.SharePoint.SPPrincipal]spuser             folder.BreakRoleInheritancetrue             sproleass.RoleDefinitionBindings.Addweb.RoleDefinitions[Contribute]             folder.RoleAssignments.Addsproleass             WriteHost Permission provided for user , strOwnerName                   else                    WriteHost User userName was not found in this web                codepre  pAnd here, are the errors associated with my codep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQhkx3.png altenter image description herep  pFull code can be found here a hrefhttppastebin.comiBpj6V1U relnofollowhttppastebin.comiBpj6V1Uap  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  precodeapply permissions to folder     Strowner name   strOwnerName     function GrantUserpermissionstrOwnerName           web  GetSPWeb identity WebURL     [Microsoft.SharePoint.SPUser]spuserweb.EnsureUserstrOwnerName     Strowner name in Function   strOwnerName    codepre  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoSyIp.png altenter image description herep  pUpdated code 2 a hrefhttppastebin.comDzP1hVce relnofollowhttppastebin.comDzP1hVceap
Negative 15108 pI working on a multilingual website MVC 5, EF 6.1. To support multiple language for some fields I splitted my tables into 2 parts.

Negative 15108 pMy program starts with a loading window while it is compiling shaders, loading textures etc. I then want to be able to launch a fullscreen application and use these resources. My understanding is that the openGL context must be the same before and after. I tried two methods for this first of all I tried making a second window which was fullscreen, and used the SDLGLmakecurrent command on this window to transfer the context across couldnt find where I read about this method, and secondly tried just fullscreening the loading window. Both of these methods resulted in the loading screen being moved to the top left corner of the screen. However opengl commands no longer ran properly in fullscreen, including clearing buffers which meant that the window contained the contents of my desktopbackground applications. p  pIs there a proper way of doing this Or is this a strange bug in sdlopengl driversp  pCode to fullscreen original windowp  precodeopengl commands work fine up to here now to fullscreen  SDLSetWindowFullscreenwindow, SDLWINDOWFULLSCREENDESKTOP SDLSetWindowSizewindow, 1366, 768 tried this on either side of line above and without either line  glViewport0, 0, 1366, 768 update viewport  glClearColor1, 1, 1, 1 glClearGLCOLORBUFFERBIT  window should be whited, other draw commands tried and all fail or distort  SDLGLSwapWindowwindow codepre  pCreating a new window and using previous contextp  precodeFine up to here  window2  SDLCreateWindowWindow, SDLWINDOWPOSCENTERED, SDLWINDOWPOSCENTERED, 1366, 768, SDLWINDOWOPENGL  SDLWINDOWFULLSCREENDESKTOP  SDLWINDOWSHOWN  SDLGLMakeCurrentwindow2, glContext created with SDLGLCreateContextoldwindow  draw commands dont work codepre  pPS running ubuntup  pstrongUpdatestrong In the second code, reusing the context in a new window, it returns an error saying invalid window when it fails, which is most of the time but not always.

Negative 15108 pCan I tell Git to reuse the conflict resolution from an existing merge commit I had rerere disabled at the time of commit.

Negative 15108 pI have a query that is removing the first record from the tables each time I close it. p  pBackground on what Im doing. I have created a query and a form that Im using to input the criteria into that query. When the user hits run it opens the query and displays the criteria they inputted. p  pThe issue Im running into is whenever the user leaves a text field blank on the form the query is suppposed to treat that as NULL and return everything. Im doing that using this Like [Forms][myForm].[myCriteria] amp . It works fine until the user closes Access and upon opening it again, it will have the criteria in the first row of the table blank.p  pOn the form I have two text boxes textbox1 and textbox2 both are from two different tables. If the user will leave textbox1 blank, run the query, closes Access and then reopens it. The record associated with textbox1 will be blank in its perspective table but only in the first row. Not entirely sure why this is happeningp  pI tried to be clear as possible, let me know if there was any confusion or if any other information is needed.p  pEDITp  pIll try to expand a bit more.p  pThere are 3 tables that all have records. Some of these records are used for criteria when the query runs.p  pTable1 will have the Component, Table2 will have the Status, Table3 will have other records that isnt necessary for the criteria but still shows when the query runsp  pThe Component and Status are what should be used as the criteria for the query and the User will type that into textbox on a form that will then open the query. If the user leaves a textbox blank for either the Component or Status it should show all Components or all Statuses from the tables when the query runs. It does that but after you close and then reopen Access the Component field or the Status field in their respective tables will be blank but only on the first row of that tablep

Negative 15108 pIm developing a small compiler. In past compilers Ive worked with I just ignored unittesting, doing all my testing via systemtests. It worked reasonably well, but I felt it always to be far from perfect. This time Im tempted to try to make things in a different way.p  pFocusing now specifically on the semantic analysis phase, Id like to have each one of my visitors having a set of associated unittests. But to be able to do so, Ill have to accomplish one of two things. I eitherp  ol lipStructure my grammar in such a way as allowing me to not have to define the package, define the class, etc, when I just want to unittest a methodrelated visitor. An example would be testing that there are no duplicated variables defined in a given method  ideally I dont need to know this method is inside a class that is inside a package. Following this path, my ANTLR grammar would be able to parse things such as codevoid m  int x  1 int y  2 int x  3 code although in the real world for the end user this wouldnt be an allowed source code, as in my language a method must emalwaysem be contained in a class that is always contained in a packagepli lipTake the time to learn the ins and outs of ANTLR and how to programatically create nodes in my junittests. Something such asp  pcodeMethodNode method  new MethodNode method.setNamem method.addChildrennew VarDeclx, new IntegerExpr1 method.addChildrennew VarDecly, new IntegerExpr2 method.addChildrennew VarDeclx, new IntegerExpr3codep  pThis may be a suitable solution if ANTLRs API is friendly for this kind of ends. Ive looked up a tiny bit and got scared by some gory details in the nodes constructors codeProgramContextParserRuleContext parent, int invokingStatecode lt this definitely doesnt seem to have been made to be used by me, the programmer, but I may be wrong..pli lipCreate my own AST and as first step in the parsing phase I convert ANTLRs tree to my tree. On one hand this would be kinda cumbersome, on the other hand, having total control over the tree could facilitate other things down the road.pli ol  pI can only assume this is a recurrent concern among compiler developers. How do you handle this specific situationp  pThanksp

I have a working .NET client that pulls back the objects and deserialises them one at a time to check the properties this is userfriendly but creates a huge amount of network traffic and is very slow.p  pNow I would like to implement a serverside search by sending a regular expression to a stored procedure that will search the text inside the BLOB. Is this possiblep  pI have tried casting the column to varchar2 using a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma828834629287 titleutlraw.casttovarchar2utlraw.casttovarchar2a, but the length of the text is too long in some cases 100KB.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma4578003629287 titledbmslob.instrdbmslob.insta allows me to search the text field for a substring, but with such a complex XML structure I would like the additional flexibility offered by regular expressions.p

In an array of 10 elements it should be                                  impossible to have a duplicate because with                                  11 it just prints from 1 to 10.

Negative 15108 pIf you look at the grammar for codedeclarators in 84code youll notice that a emcodenoptrdeclaratorcodeem can be written as emcodeptrdeclaratorcodeem, that is, it can be written as emcodedeclaratoridcodeem, which validates declarations like the ones in the title.

Negative 15108 pIntroduction to the problem Im making a program to track flight paths of airports using linked lists. For example if the data set isp  precodeAustin  Dallas, Dallas  Houston codepre  pand you try to find a flight p  precodeAustin  Houston  codepre  pit will calculate that you need to take the flightpath p  precodeAustin  Dallas  Houston codepre  pThe way my solution works if I can figure out how to do this is that I have an outer linked list composed of codeOuterNodecodes which each contain an inner linked list of flights. The inner linked list is composed of codeInnerNodecodes which contain pointers to the outer nodes aka the flight destination. In theory it would make a lot of things easier to iterate through without having to keep copying over data through strings. In my header too many of my things require each other and cant have the implementation in the right order. this is all in the header of the innerlist classp  precodestruct OuterNode      InnerList flights     int name     OuterNode next   struct InnerNode      OuterNode dest     int price     InnerNode next  class InnerList  public     InnerList     InnerList     void addInnerNode private     InnerNode innerhead  codepre  pSo basicallyp  pcodeOuterNodecode  needs codeInnerListcode no definition yetp  pcodeInnerNodecode  needs codeOuterNodecodep  pcodeInnerListcode  needs codeInnerNodecodep  pAnd currently the error is that codeInnerListcode doesnt exist when codeOuterNodecode needs to make one. How can I fix this so that everything finds what it needs Is there some creative use of templates or something that I could use to fix thisp

Negative 15108 pIm building an i0S 8 iPad app for a friends business to help him and his employees sync appraisal data between devices. In other words, if one employee creates an appraisal, that appraisal should be accessible by all other employees that are running the app. The appraisal data is composed of a few strings, a few numbers, and some image files. p  pIve built a few other iOS apps, but this is the first app Ive built that deals with syncing data between devices. Since its an iPadonly app, iCloud sounds like the ideal cloud service to use for the syncing functionality. The problem is, all the iPads are personal iPads and have different iCloud accounts. p  ol liIs there a way to sync app data between different iCloud accounts using CloudKitli liIf not, do you have any other ideas for how I can sync this kind of data between iPadsli ol  pIm still reading up on CloudKit, but I wanted to post this question in the meantime. p

Negative 15108 pI am creating a chrome extension for gmail, and I have seen some odd instabilities around when certain page objects load.  Since I am trying to modify the GMAIL DOM Customize it for my extension it needs to be fully loaded before my initializer runs. My extension always initializes well before the DOM is fully loaded, so I need a way to have it poll until the DOM is fully formed to do its thing.p  pI have tried using document.readyState to poll the document so I know when to start modifying the fullyloaded DOM, but it doesnt always work.p  pI put into the console a printout of document.readyState polled every 100 milliseconds once the page begins to load, and I noticed that about 110 page loads document.readyState becomes complete BEFORE the DOM is fully loaded.  I can tell this because I do a jQuery selector for the GMAIL compose button and it comes up empty when this occurs, and find it as expected every other time It finds the compose button.p  pWhy would this be Is there a better way to have my extension initialize script check to make sure the DOM is fully loaded before firing the DOM modsp  pEDIT I have the script that checks document.readyState as a script injected into the UI as a content script.p

Negative 15108 pI am trying to find out of which MCU 8x8, 16x8 and 16x16 a pictures is made of. To do this I parse the Start of Frame SOFn Marker where the chroma subsampling factors are stored.  I have found the following contentp  precodeNumber of Img components  3 Component[1] ID0x01, Samp Fac0x22 Subsamp 1 x 1, Quant Tbl Sel0x00 Lum Y Component[2] ID0x02, Samp Fac0x11 Subsamp 2 x 2, Quant Tbl Sel0x01 Chrom Cb Component[3] ID0x03, Samp Fac0x11 Subsamp 2 x 2, Quant Tbl Sel0x01 Chrom Cr codepre  pI am confused on how to interpret that. Reading a hrefhttpwww.impulseadventure.comphotojpegdecoder.html relnofollowthisa I came to believe that 1x1 stands for 444 sampling and thus leading to a 8x8 pixel MCU, 2x1 for 422  16x8 pixel MCU and 2x2 for 420  16x16 pixl MCU.p  pEvery sampling rate dictates how the components are stored in the entropy coded data and thus leading to the MCU. But now every component Y, Cb, Cr has its own subsampling rate. p  pHow do I interpret the date I read from the JPEG marker to judge wich MCU is used through the whole imagep

Do I need to do more than just execute the js files p

Negative 15108 pIve built a Java program with an administrator console and a server thread. The server will be communicating with remote clients who are sending encrypted information. That information is being written by the server into a directory. Administrators, through the admin console, will log in, verify that they are an admin, and will be able to send commands to the server to alter the directory. Is there a way assure that only the Java program and superuser are capable of reading, writing, or executing the files in that directory If not, how can I be sure that an adversary does not alter the program themselves p

Negative 15108 pIm making a game in Python and PyGame, its a scrolling 2d Shootemup style game, and Im having an annoying problem. For some reason, while Im playing it, randomly it will crash, but instead of closing the window, the music and sound effects cut out, and I can still play it, but when I try to close it from there it wont close. p  pAt first I thought this was a problem in the code, but my friend who is also working on it is using Windows, and this crashing has never happened to him, while Im running Ubuntu and it happens usually within the first 30 seconds to a minute of playing. Its very annoying and Im worried that its not just a problem with my computer. Is this something wrong with my python or PyGame installation I never get an error message, but I also can only close the window by closing the terminal.p  pThe source code can be found on github here  a hrefhttpsgithub.comwazzup771NLC2015 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comwazzup771NLC2015ap  pbut Im not sure where to even look.

Negative 15108 pI have, perhaps, 180 entries in my mysql table.  I still have many rows to insert but I will eventually need to add an additional column called style which will have two options.  First off Ill need to put an option for the first couple hundred entries I already have  and next Ill need to duplicate those same entries except with option 2 as style.  My ultimate question is how will I achieve duplicating these rows quickly preferably with a simple query, and second how to duplicate those same rows but with a different option for style.br Thank youp

Negative 15108 pI have a download program in windows forms which downloads the html source code of a bunch of URLs and extract further URLs and downloads that stuff too. I am usingp  precodeusingWebClient client  new WebClient       Do download stuff here...  codepre  pbut .NET Mem profiler shows a severe memory leak because a lot of object are garbage collected but not disposed OR disposed but not garbage collected. Sound weird to me but my program has a memory leak.p  pTo get a feel of my program consider this code pleasep  precodeprivate void PreprocessURLsListltstringgt URLs      usingWebClient client  new WebClient              Download first batch of html source code and put in a Listltstringgt property        private void ProcessURLsListltstringgt URLs      usingWebClient client  new WebClient              Download more stuff and save them       codepre  pand so on. This is not the actual program but what I want to show you is, how do I create a globally available WebClient objectinstance so I do not create a bunch off client objects I want to reuse it. I suspect this to be the cause maybe among others to cause the memory leak. Maybe I am wrong because I have never created a program with a task where it could have a memory leak.p  pEDIT After suggestion of tlemster I created a static instance of WebClient but that causes an IO error because concurrent IO are not supported DownloadFileAsync.p  pEDIT1 Here is my download method which does the main work and blocking my UI thread by doing so.

Negative 15108 pIve got a Model class called BaseNode which has a Name property and a Dictionary property.

Negative 15108 pIm developing a social app and have some problems with populating objects from parse created in a selected cell. p  pThe Home screen is a UITableViewController, populates an array of objects stored in Parse, when a user taps a cell, a new scene DetailViewController will be pushed, which shows the object from the selected cell in a view.p  pNext, I created in DetailViewController a UIButton to add objects to a new class called replies and also have added into the DetailViewController scene, a TableView which is populated using a new array from those objects at the replies class. p  pI want to retrieve just the objects created on the selected cell  At the moment everything works fine except on the DetailViewController scene the TableView will show all the objects created in the replies class no matter on which cell I tap.p  pI wonder how would I store an array from the selected cell so I can populate the objects that have been created at that selected cell...

Negative 15108 pIm working on a Wordpress plugin that uses the Wordpress Options.php functionality. I have a settingsfield registered and access those options with thisp  precodexoptions  getoptionxsettings codepre  pSo that on my page I can reference xoptions[firstname] to pull given settings, and have them saved and updated automatically via Wordpress Options.php. The problem is, I cant read or set values in the xoptions associative array manually without having to use the xsettings[firstname] syntax that gets buried in the HTML and submitted with a form. I need to update these values without sending a form.p  pWhat Im trying to do, basically, is set the value of one of those values manually like thisp  precodexoptions[firstname]  Derek Walters codepre  pbut that doesnt work as it would with a normal associative array. Im wondering if theres a way to manually read and write namesvalues from Worpress Options.p  pIve tried setting it manually withp  precodeupdateoptionfirstname,POST[name] codepre  pAny help would be fantastic. Thanks in advance Ive been Googling for hours and trying different slabs of code and havent figured out if its even possible.p

Negative 15108 pIm trying to get my head around the angular directives, basically, the directive i want to build is a simple html select builder with some predefined options. This works great.p  pBut what i cannot figure out it, how to load the directive with an option preselected, but to also assign the select to any particular codescopecode.. the snippet below works but you need to predetermine the codescopecode name in the directive as opposed to dynamically by a directive attribute.p  pCurrently the select is bound to codengSelectDayMonth.daycode, which is OK, but it would be more flexible if you could choose dynamically, to better fit with any controller.

Negative 15108 h2Questionh2  pI am trying to present view controller modally a UIImagePickerController to be precise while animating some views before the presentation.p  pIts important to note that the animations and the presentation of the view are not chained, and there can be a timegap between the views animating and modally presenting the image picker.p  pWith all that said, while I present the view controller, it seems that all of the subviews of the current view Im in the view Im presenting from  the parent view controllers view are being reset to their original storyboard positions, which causes all of the animations Ive done in the view BEFORE presenting the image picker to reset.p  pAnother thing worth noting, is that I use AutoLayout to position the views I animate.p  pIve added a sample animation showing the problem  notice how the Animate button snaps back to its original position right after I click the Present Modal View Controller button Ive toggled Slow Animations right before presenting the modal view controller so you can see the Animate button snaps back.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHTQSS.gif altenter image description herep  pIm also adding a link to the example app shown in the animation so you examine the problem more deeply, a hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0B9nYtwT7nIyTMDJJX3M3WE5ucWMviewuspsharing relnofollowclick herea to download it.p  h2Answerh2  pTo solve the issue, I used kokxs answer, and animated the Auto Layout constraints of the views instead of their frame values.

Negative 15108 pI have a requirement to print pdf files in two different ways one through web page where user will see the print preview and choose the printer and print it. Second way is to automate the printing, just by clicking a button, the pdf should be sent to printer.p  pThe first way of printing is through web page is working fine, but not the second way. The default printer is successfully retrieved for automatic printing, but is not getting printed and I am not getting any error as well. Following are my analysisp  ol liInitially, I thought the codeDocFlavorcode is not supported. Then I listed down the supported codeDocFlavorcode of that printer and one of them was applicationoctetstream, which is codeDocFlavor.INPUTSTREAM.AUTOSENSEcode. So the flavor is supported by printer.li liThen, I added the codePrintJobListenercode to check if the print job is failed. When I added that listener to the printJob, it prints codeNoMoreEventscode and codeDATATRANSFERCOMPLETEcode, which should have printed codeJOBCOMPLETEcode, if the job is success.li liFinal step is to debug the Java code. When I executed the line codejob.printcode, it goes into codeWin32PrintJob.printcode method. I did F6 to execute each line to see what its doing. I compared it with the code in a hrefhttpgrepcode.comfilerepository.grepcode.comjavarootjdkopenjdk6b27sunprintWin32PrintJob.javaWin32PrintJob.print28javax.print.Doc2Cjavax.print.attribute.PrintRequestAttributeSet29GrepCodea, as the source code was not loaded in eclipse.

Negative 15108 pIve been trying to fit a nonlinear mixed model in R to my data but Im having a hard time understanding the help files and examples people are using. Im a masters student trying to model changes in behaviour as welfare measures in 4 sheep over the course of 22 days. Days 4 to 1 is used as baseline, day 0 has no measures as they were in surgery and days 1 to 17 are what Im interested in. Plotting the different datasets gives me nice dips around days 1 to 3 after surgery after which they more or less return to baseline. I was first told to square my explanatory variable Day but when using lmer that doesnt really change my results at all. So I want to try nlmer to see if that works better. p  pMy dataset looks like this and goes down to 500 lines or so. Sheep is read as a factorp  pcode.

Negative 15108 pIm about to start creating a simple client application that needs to be fully self contained and super easy to install. I was looking around at what packaging  deployment solutions there are for Scala. The requirements at this stage is that it must contain its own JRE rather than relying on the system one and be really easy to install native installersscripts or a zip. At some point it will also need to autoupdate but I can do this manually unless there is a better solution.p  pI came across SBT Native Packager. This looks really cool and seems to give me most of the things I want. However I couldnt see an obvious way to include a JRE though.p  pWhat is the best way to package and deploy Scala applications with a JRE and Scala Library Can this solution also cater for in place upgrades.p

In that quiz you will have question Like take any variable and echo it out and then user will write this in online editor and after that if he did right, he got quiz complete. Since php solutions can be different for a same question how can i manage a great logic that can check for every question not just for echo, even like questions Create html form with text field with any name and when it submit set in session and display the value. or Create a login formp  pI need logic to the quiz. I have some logic like the better is PHP testing for each individual quiz and check whether the output is same or the solution user entered is producing same result like the quiz questions answer. or other options are having in my mind.p  pHope you got my question.

Im having some trouble in figuring out how these three work together. p  pJust picking out the codecollgcode scenario, for example, how does the codepushpullcode work with the existing codecollg8 collgoffset1code for codearticlecode and codecollg3code for codeasidecode p  pThe way I had it was p  ol liFirst the codecollgcode measurements were added both for the article and aside columns. So, the article occupied 8 columns and the aside occupied 3 columns.li liThen codecollgoffset1code was added to article, so it would be pushed 1 col towards the right, in other words  towards the aside, even though it should have been the other way around. But I guess this is because in the next step, articles and aside would be swapped through codepushpullcode, which would then make sense.li licodecollgpush3code was added to article, and codecollgpull9code was  added to aside. This is where im stuck. Essentially you want the article to occupy 9 columns, so why is codecolpush3code added to it Common logic says it should be codepush9code. Same goes for aside.li liLast, once the article and aside are swapped with codepushpullcode, how is the offset applied With the codepushpullcode being applied, article covers 9 columns and aside covers 3 columns. So where did the 1 column of offset go, that was originally applied to article Are those codecollgcode measurements now overriddenli ol  pMany thanks for all the helpp

But after this validation succeeded I want to prevent normal submission again.
