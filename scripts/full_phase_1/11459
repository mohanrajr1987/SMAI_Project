Positive 11459 pRefering to a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryms189499.aspx relnofollowherea regarding the order of execution of SELECT query, there is an codeONcode mentioned before codeJOINcode. p  precodeFROM ON JOIN WHERE GROUP BY WITH CUBE or WITH ROLLUP HAVING SELECT DISTINCT ORDER BY TOP codepre  pI tend to think this codeONcode is the codeONcode clause as part of the codeJOINcode.p  ul lipIf it is false, what is this codeONcode pli lipIf it is true, then it is a bit confusing, because I think when doing a codeJOINcode, SQL Server do a codeCROSS JOINcode before filtering with codeONcode. This may not be strictly correct as SQL server has some mechanism to optimize this process, something regarding chosing one smaller table as inner table to loop the outer table as I remember correctly for the codeONcode condition. Then in this case, wouldnt codeJOINcode be before codeONcode in execution order pli ul  pCould you shed some light on what I mention p
Positive 11459 pIm doing some basic data processing stuff with Stata. However, I get stuck on how to keep the observations of the other variables matching, after modifying a variables value label.  p  pFor example, say, I have the raw dataset as followsp  precode   var1   var2   var3     US    1000    15   China    500    20     UK     800    10 codepre  pThe emvar1em is a string variable. I need to convert it into a numeric one. So I typed p  precode   encode var1, gencountry     where the new variable country is numeric codepre  pThe variables that I want for future work are emvar2em, emvar3em and emcountryem. p  pWhen the new variable is generated, it automatically has a value label. To be specific, if I click on US in the column of emcountryem, it shows 3 in the cell on top of the column.p  precode   var1   var2   var3  country     US    1000    15     US   China    500    20   China     UK     800    10     UK codepre  pSo far its good. I mean for each row the observations match. p  pHowever, this automatically generated value label is not exactly what I want. What I need is to make 1 denote UK, 2 for US and 3 for China. So I modified it byp  precode     label define country 1 UK 2 US 3 China, modify codepre  pAs shown below, I get the value labels that I want. Like, a click on China gives me 3.  p  precode     var1   var2   var3  country       US    1000    15    China     China    500    20     UK       UK     800    10     US codepre  pBut the point is, as you may already notice, the order of the observations for emcountryem is arranged alphabetically. It makes the corresponding values of emvar2em and emvar3em for each country to be wrong. p  pThat is exactly where I could not get through. Since the columns that I finally need are emvar2em, emvar3em and emcountryem, Id like to have each country with its corresponding values of emvar2em, emvar3em and as well the customized value labels. p  pI tried emsortem, emorderem and a couple of commands but none gave me the result. I dont know what command I should use or theres something wrong in my earlier work. p
Positive 11459 pI have 1 Source number set or vector with 50 integer numbers between 1 and 100  a profile with 50 characteristics rated between 1 and 100p  pI have 1,000,000 Target number sets or vectors, also each with 50 integer numbers  1M more of such profilesp  pI want to order the 1,000,000 Target sets by similarity to the Source set  I want to browse through best to worst matchp  pI want the routine to return an ordered list in lt1 sec triggered from web application, returned to laptop andor mobile device  Performance requirement for end userp  pI want the routine to do this even when there are 100 similar requests being submitted at the same time for different Source number sets  Support for concurrent usersp  pThe above numbers are to give an indication of scale. I may wind up with more integers in the set new characteristics added or with more Target sets more profiles or with more concurrent requests more concurrent users, but this is good for nowp  pIf it helps, I am happy with results being clustered in buckets. I.e. top 10,000 results in a top 1 bucket. Next 10,000 results in a top 2 bucket, etc. I do not necessarily care about order within each such bucket too granular a distinction for the end user to warrant any added performance investment.p  pEqually, because an end user would never fit 1,000,000 results in their UI, I am happy if the algorithm somehow only returns a smaller subset of returns for example  only the top matches. But further browsing should still load the rest of the list in a performant way.p  pA practical use case imagine a dating app where an end user is asked to rate, on a slider bar, 50 characteristics for how important they are to them. And where the app returns the best matches, updated live as you makes edits.p  pWhich techniques  type of algorithms are best suited to tackle this requirementp  pInitial attempts use Squared Euclidean Distance, but this proves too resource intensive given the size of data and the performance requirements.  Bigger differences for a given characteristic ideally do carry more weight as they do when using the Squared Euclidean Distance methodp

Positive 11459 pSorry if this was asked before, and if it was, just drop a link.  Im fairly new to C.p  pI have a project that requires me to create a Twitterlike program where each User has their own wall, homepage, friends list, inbox, etc. The problem is is that I have to turn in one .cpp file I have to put all classes on one file. Now since C reads from top to bottom, Im having an issue with creatingreferencing other classes because they havent been defined yet.p  pFor instance, since User contains an object made from my FriendsList class, I have to put FriendsList first, but then theres an issue where I cant make an array that holds User because User hasnt been defined yet.p  pSorry if this is a stupid question.p  pEdit How would I go about forward declarationp  precodeclass FriendsList class User      FriendsList friends      constructor and other stuff  class FriendsList  stuff  codepre  pWould it be like that Sorry Im just confused.p

Negative 11459 pUnderlying the TCP transport stack are a number of buffer limits sometimes documented by their authors.  On WinXP SP3 Ive run into one of these, I think, and cant figure out why.p  pI have implemented a simple client to get data from a server written by a colleague in Java.  The protocol is to write the length of the data in network order in four bytes and then the data.  The server writes the data to the TCP stream in 1024 byte blocks.  The client correctly receives the length of the data buffer, allocates memory and repeatedly calls recv in a loop to get all of the datap  precodeunsigned int TCPBlockSize  4096 unsigned int len int result  ...code to request len... unsigned char buf  new unsigned char[len]  if len gt TCPBlockSize  Uint32 currentLen  0 result  0 Uint32 failCount  0 while currentLen lt len ampamp result gt 0          result  recv sock, buf  currentLen, TCPBlockSize          if result gt 0               currentLen  currentLen  result          else          break            codepre  pIf I set TCPBlockSize to 4095 or below, all is good and I can receive multimegabyte transmissions.  When I try 4096 size receive blocks, the last request for the remaining data, which is len  currentLen lt TCPBlockSize, always fails with a return value of 1, and errno  0.  I tried a few experiments like trimming the size of the data transmitted and somewhere between 815054 and 834246 bytes everything goes boom for 4096 byte receive blocks.p  pOne other detail the server closes the socket after sending the last byte.  Which begs the question, why wouldnt the remaining data be returned It feels like a defect to not return 1 from recv until the stream is then empty emandem closed, as it is ambiguous when the stream is not empty emandem closed to receive 1 from recv. p  pSo how do I get the last of datap

Negative 11459 pEnvironment SQL Server 2005 SP2 9.0.3077 Transactional Publications Production and Betap  pI have a situation where I have two different Replication Publications setup that use some of the same Articles.  Each of these Publications feeds a subscriber on a different machine.  One of these shared Articles is a table.  At a regular time interval many of the records in this table become aged and no longer needed.  At this time a stored procedure that deletes records is called.  p  pTo save on resources and improve latency times to the subscribers I have set the replicate property on this stored procedure to Execution of the stored procedure instead of the default Stored procedure definition only.  This way when the stored procedure deletes 2,000,000 records these dont replicate down to the subscribers.  Instead the execution of the stored procedure is replicated and the same replicated stored procedure on the subscribers is executed and it deletes the same 2,000,000 rows.  p  pThe problem Im having is with my second publication.  I didnt need this type of behavior so I left the article property on the stored procedure set to Stored procedure definition only and was expecting replication to remove the rows at the other subscriber but it wasnt.  The table at the subscriber just kept gaining records. So to fix it I set the Article Property to Execution... and called it good.  Which is probably the best solution so beta matches production, but it still feels like a kludge as the publication properties should work independently of each other.p  pQuestion Why does the Execution of the stored procedure article property take precedence and get applied to the other publication even though it is set to Stored procedure definition only in the other publicationp

Negative 11459 pI have a typical enterprisebusiness application that I am developing that includes orders, salespersons, contacts, reference data, etc...  There will be at least 100 or more users on the system at a time who are entering new data, changing data, etc.  I need to provide search capability across the application for almost all tables.  p  pOne option is to do table queries such as select  from salespersons where name contains searchtest or something similar.  But I was wondering if I can use Lucene.net for this instead.  p  pThe main thing is that the search needs to reflect changes within a few seconds.  So if a user enters a order, for example, and then immediately searches for it right after, then it needs to show up in the search list.  i.e., I cant have an index job every hour or half hour, or nightly, etc.  p  pIs this something that would work well, or is there a better optionp

Negative 11459 pI want to create a portal website for login, news and user management.  And another web site for a web app that the portal redirects to after login.p  pOne of my goals is to be able to host the portal and webapp on different servers.  The portal would transmit the users id to the webapp, once the user had successfully logged in and been redirected to the web app.  But I dont want people to be able to just bypass the login, or access other users accounts, by transmitting user ids straight to the web app.p  pMy first thought is to transmit the user id encrypted as a post variable or query string value.  Using some kind of publicprivate key scenario, and adding a DateTime stamp to key to make it vary everytime.p  pBut I havent done this kind of thing before, so Im wondering if there arent better ways to do this. p  pI could potentially communicate via database, by having the portal store the user id with a key in a database and passing that key to the web app which uses it to get the user id from that database.  But that seems crazy.p  pCan anyone give a way to do this or advice  Or is this a bad idea alltogetherp  pThanks for your time.p

I thought I understood that to be because of the ability of the use of the modifiers private, public, internal, protected.  However, after learning about properties I am sort of torn in understanding not only properties uses, but the overall importanceability of data protection what I understood as encapsulation within C.  p  pTo be more specific, everything I have read when I got to properties in C is that you should try to use them in place of fields when you can because ofp  pstrong1strong they allow you to change the data type when you cant when directly accessing the field directly.p  pstrong2strong they add a level of protection to data accessp  pHowever, from what I thought I had come to know about the use of field modifiers did 2, it seemed to me that properties just generated additional code unless you had some reason to change the type 1  because you are more or less creating hidden methods to access fields as opposed to directly.  p  pThen there is the whole modifiers being able to be added to Properties which further complicates my understanding for the need of properties to access data.p  pI have read a number of chapters from different writers on properties and none have really explained a good understanding of properties vs. fields vs. encapsulation and good programming methods.p  pstrongCan someone explainstrongp  pstrong1strong why I would want to use properties instead of fields especially when it appears I am just adding additional codep  pstrong2strong any tips on recognizing the use of properties and not seeing them as simply methods with the exception of the getset being apparent when tracing other peoples codep  pstrong3strong Any general rules of thumb when it comes to good programming methods in relation to when to use whatp  pThanks and sorry for the long post  I didnt want to just ask a question that has been asked 100x without explaining why I am asking it again.p

So, Im able to see at first one image, then after scrolling through the same cell, two images are led over one another[some part of earlier photo is visible] and so on. Can this be because of cellreusability What is the ideal way to about this issuep  pEDITp  pIm using following codep  precodenoOfPhotos  [photosarray count]  ifnoOfPhotos gt 0      commentWhenWebviewNotThere.alpha  0.0         Things that are not visible when images are there     noOfCommentsWhenWebviewNotThere.alpha  0.0     commentsLblWhenWebviewAbset.alpha  0.0      image1.hidden  NO     image2.hidden  NO     image3.hidden  NO     image4.hidden  NO      commentsLblWhenWebview.alpha  1.0     noOfComments.alpha  1.0     comment.alpha  1.0  forNSInteger x  0 x lt noOfPhotos x     photoName  [photosarray objectAtIndexx]      NSString urlAddress  [NSString stringWithFormat,photoName]        NSURL url  [NSURL URLWithStringurlAddress]            NSURLRequest requestObj  [NSURLRequest requestWithURLurl]                  ifx  0         image1  [[UIWebView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake10, comment.frame.origin.y  5, 60, 60]     [image1 loadRequestrequestObj]              Load the request in the UIWebView.

If there are two elements that overlap within a family I mean a family of persons whose DNA I have and read in there is also a forstatement inside the foreachstatement that lets the program check this for every family, which makes it last even longer, I check whether they also have the same copy number which is stored in another hash with the same keys and print out the result.p  pThank you guys for your timep

Negative 11459 pFloating point type represents a number by storing its significant digits and its exponent separately on separate binary words so it fits in 16, 32, 64 or 128 bits.p  pFixed point type stores numbers with 2 words, one representing the integer part, another representing the part past the radix, in negative exponents, 21, 22, 23, etc.p  pFloat are better because they have wider range in an exponent sense, but not if one wants to store number with more precision for a certain range, for example only using integer from 16 to 16, thus using more bits to hold digits past the radix.p  pIn terms of performances, which one has the best performance, or are there cases where some is faster than the other p  pIn video game programming, does everybody use floating point because the FPU makes it faster, or because the performance drop is just negligible, or do they make their own fixed type p  pWhy isnt there any fixed type in CC p

To avoid having to copypaste these 2030 lines of code all over the place I have put them into a handler class which my controllers take a dependency on in the constructor, the actions then call this class which leaves my actions containing just one line of code.

It doesnt break  and it still gives me the rest of the fields  its just that one field thats empty.p  pExamplep  precodethisgtpaginate  array conditions gt array      Item.name   gt , ,  data  thisgtpaginateItem codepre  pThis will return all the items in my table including the one that I thought had an empty name field  but when I try to echo the name to the page, it works for every item except the one with a special character .  I changed it to a normal e and it shows up fine.p  pHow can I return results even if they have a special character in their name  Thanks in advancep

Negative 11459 pIn Javascript, Im trying to take an initial array of number values and count the elements inside it. Ideally, the result would be two new arrays, the first specifying each unique element, and the second containing the number of times each element occurs. However, Im open to suggestions on the format of the output.p  pFor example, if the initial array wasp  precode5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 4 codepre  pThen two new arrays would be created. The first would contain the name of each unique elementp  precode5, 2, 9, 4 codepre  pThe second would contain the number of times that element occurred in the initial arrayp  precode3, 5, 1, 1 codepre  pBecause the number 5 occurs three times in the initial array, the number 2 occurs five times and 9 and 4 both appear once.p  pIve searched a lot for a solution, but nothing seems to work, and everything Ive tried myself has wound up being ridiculously complex.

Negative 11459 pI read a lot of articles and answers of similar topics over the internet but didnt find the reason for my problem.p  pI have a .NET 4 Windows Service connecting to SQL Server Express on the same machine. Only one time in production it happened to see the following error p  pemA connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the login process. provider Named Pipes Provider, error 0  No process is on the other end of the pipe..em p  pThe reason for having this error is clear if we use named pipes protocol because we havent enabled them on the server. But my question here is why named pipes protocol could be used here In the connection string we have used emData Source.SQLEXPRESSem. Having in mind the information in msdn and over the internet my understanding is that when . is used always the Shared Memory Protocol must be used. So what must happen so that ADO.NET SqlClient decides to use Named Pipe Protocol insteadp  pMost of the times everything is working just fine, but I need to know the process so that we can prevent any further errors of this type if needed.p  pThanks in advance,  Todorp

Negative 11459 pHibernate provides at least two options for getting around the N1 query problem. The one is setting the FetchMode to Subselect, which generates a select with a INclause and a subselect within this INclause. The other is to specify a BatchSize, which generates a select with a INclause containing the parents IDs.p  pBoth work but I find that the Subselect option often runs into performance problems due to the query for the parents being complex. On the other hand, with a large BatchSize say 1000, the number of queries and complexity of those queries are very small.p  pMy question is thus when would you use Hibernates Subselect FetchMode over BatchSize Subselect probably makes sense if you have a very large number of parent entries thousands, but are there any other scenarios where youd prefer a Subselect to BatchSizep  pEDIT I noticed a difference between the two when dealing with eager loading. If you have an xToMany association set to be loaded eagerly and through a subselect, it generates a subselect like it would if it was lazy. If you specify a BatchSize however, the generated query  makes use of a outer join instead of a seperate query. Is there any way to force Hibernate to use a seperate batched query when loading eagerlyp

Negative 11459 pWeve got a server with Team Foundation Server 2008 installed on it. Clients using Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2010 connect to it. Ive written a custom checkin policy for TFS which is working as expected in VS2010 but not in VS2008.p  pI originally developed it in VS2010 but had some issues getting it working. To rule out problems with my custom policy, I recreated the Solution and Project in VS2008 as I had a working sample in VS2008. p  pOnce developed, I then tried setting it in VS2010 but had some issues. I found this posting by Grant Smith httpconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails553740vs2008tfscheckinpoliciesfailtoloadwithvs2010 who suggested to change the binding redirects for VS2010. This resolved the problem and policy is now working fine for it.p  pHowever, it is not working for VS2008. When I try to checkin any code it says TF10139 The following checkin policies have not been satisfied. Internal error in My Custom Checkin Policy.p  pWhen I try to change the settings for the policy, it gives me an error saying Error loading the My Custom Checkin Policy policy The policy assembly MyCheckinPolicy, Version1.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokennull is not registered..

Negative 11459 pon more than one occasion I felt the need to define class methods that get called in a manner similar to constructors or destructors. p  pA specific example would be in a program I had a very complex network of nodes of different types that depended mutually on each other in a very irregular fashion The network did not resemble a tree at all. When a node needed to be destroyed, it started a complex chain of destructions in the network. Much like a spider web being torn apart, but more complex.p  pDuring the execution of this chain, the control came back to the methods of the initiator or one of the intermediate elements in the chain, so that the actual destruction had to take place when the chain had settled, and thats why I couldnt use destructors for this purpose. However, along the class hierarchy of my nodes, I needed a destructor like, i.e. a ladder way of calling my nondestructing predestruct function for exactly the same reasons why an actual destructor is also called that way, namely, every step in the class hierarchy needed to contribute to the chain in a different way.p  pI ended up coding the ladder by hand. Namely, the class nodeBase has a method called preDestroyNodeBase which does its job and calls the virtual method preDestroyNode and so on until the leaf I know, this way it looks like a constructor, but it was comparatively more elegant that way, since you can just call the preDestroy of the most base class.p  pYou can imagine how error prone this approach is, not to mention ugly. Is there a cleaner way of emulating constructor or destructor way of calling methods Some kind of template magic or even macro magic Because hand coding it is too errorprone, even for a single programmer, so I cannot imagine exposing this kind of behavior to the clients of a library.p  pMaybe Im missing a fundamental programming concept that obsoletes the need for such functions. If that is the case, Id be glad if you pointed how else that network of nodes example could be handled.p  pThanks a lotp

Negative 11459 pI have a UIImageView inside of my UIViewController. It loads an image that is 81x37 with an origin of 0x20. What I am trying to do is create that image as my background as well as a logo.

I had it up and running in no time but before I knew it my code became extremely convoluted and mixed between samples I found on here and the demo commonware has in the git repo.p  pCan somebody please point me towards something that shows how to initiate the service, set up a broadcast receiver, and then pull data out of the receiver into my activity.

Negative 11459 pMy problem is that I have code that need a rebooted node.  I have many long running Jenkins test jobs that needs to be executed on rebooted nodes.  p  pMy existing solution is to define multiple proxy machines in Jenkins with the same label TestLable and 1 executor per machine. I bind all the test jobs to the label TestLable. In the test execution script I detect the Jenkins machine Jenkins env. NODENAME and use that to know what physical physical machine the tests should use.p  pDo anybody know of a better solution p  pThe above works but I need to define a high number of nodesmachines that may not be needed. What I would like was a plugin that would be able to grant a token to a Jenkins job. This way a job would not be executed before a Jenkins executor and a token was free.  The token should be a string so that my test jobs could use it to know what external node it could use.  p
Negative 11459 pI am currently writing a REST API using Symfony2. I started using Symfony2 one month ago and im currently facing a technical difficulty.p  pWhile writing my API I wanted to rate limit the API calls by IP addresses or by user i.e if the user is logged in Im using his id, a timestamp and his IP address to keep a trace of his connection, if hes not logged in, I just save his IP address and a timestamp in my database. To do this I wrote a service implementing codeVoterInterfacecode and whos called by Symfony everytime a user accesses a controller and checks whether he didnt exceed the API rate limit by hour or by day theyre both hardcoded. This works fine until now.p  pBut I want something more customizable and scalable, I would like to set up for each controller their own limit so I could control and change easily my API rate limit for each one. My idea is to use an annotation like the ones you can use with the codeJMSSecurityExtraBundlecode and specify on the top of each of my controllers something like p  precode   My API  UserControllerregisterAction     RateLimithour200, day2000   public function registerActionformat codepre  pAnd then retrieve the annotation informations in my rate limiter class to fill the limits informations. The problem is I didnt manage to find how and I need some help. My solution works, I just need something more powerfull. I already thought about storing these informations in a YAML file or in a database, but this is not a good solution to me since it creates an unnecessary dependency between my controllers and a persistence.p  pThank you in advance for your help.p

Negative 11459 pI like to ask for input how to best design the most optimal architecture using TPL Dataflow. I do not have written code yet so there is no sample code I can post. I am not looking for code unless volunteered either but assistance in the design would be much appreciatedp  pThe requirements are as followsp  pI have 3 core datablocks that are dependent on each other in specific ways. Datablock1 is a producer that produces objects of type Foo1. Datablock2 is supposed to subscribe to Foo1 objects from Datablock1 and potentially not upon each and every Foo1, subject to a specific function produce Foo2 objects that it stores in an output queue for other datablocks to consume. Datablock3 also consumes Foo1 objects from Datablock1 and potentially produces Foo3 objects that Datablock2 consumes and transforms into Foo2 objects. p  pIn summary, here are the datablocks and what they each produce and consumep  ul liDatablock1 ProducesFoo1, ConsumesNothingli liDatablock2 ProducesFoo2, ConsumesFoo1, Foo3li liDatablock3 ProducesFoo3, ConsumesFoo1li ul  pAn additional requirement is that that the same Foo1 are processed at about the same time in Datablock2 and Datablock3. It would be ok if Foo1 objects are first consumed by Datablock2 and then once Datablock2 has done its work the very same Foo1 objects are posted to Datablock3 for it to do its work. Foo2 objects from Datablock2 can result from either operations on Foo1 objects or Foo3 objects.p  pI hope this makes sense, I am happy to explain more if it is still unclear.p  pMy first idea was to create TPL Dataflowblocks for each of the 3 datablocks and to make them handle incoming streams of different object types. Another idea is to split up datablocks and have each datablock only handle streams of one single object type. What do you recommend or is there an even better solution that may work  p  pSvick has already helped on the Datablock1 and it is already operational, I am just stuck on how to go about transforming my current environment as described above to TPL Dataflow. p  pAny ideas or pointers are much appreciated.p
Negative 11459 pIm developing a serial port dll in win32 assembly MASM32. It has its own thread checking multiple events and at a specified buffer treshold itd notify the managed main application by calling a callback function. It just a call with no argumentsreturn value.p  pAt startup the main application stores the callback functions address by calling a function in the dllp  precodepCallBackFunction dd 0  SetCallBackPointer proc pcbDWORD  mov eax, pcb mov pCallBackFunction, eax call DWORD ptr pCallBackFunction  verify it immediately ret  SetCallBackPointer endp codepre  pThe upper function immediately calls back the managed application callback routine for verification purposes. It is working fine. However, when I place the call instruction to other functions in the dll it crashes the application.

Negative 11459 pIm just learning ASP.net and also making a web app for a friend in the same.p  pNow, in my app, there is a table that maps users to companys branches, and another to map branches to clients.

This happens a lot of times and is required on many pages.p  pAlso, Im using DevExpress GridView and GridViewLookUp tools. If youre familiar with them, they are just like GridView in ASP.net and cause a postback each time the displayed entries are sorted or a different page is selected for viewing the entries. Basically, I want to to know that I have to fire the above two queries a lot of times.p  pThere are on an average 100150 clients that a user is usually responsible for.p  pSo what I want to know is, for a number that high, should I retrieve all the client names and store them in a session so that I dont have to connect to the database again as long as the user is logged in Or should I just keep it the way it is and let it find clients every time from the databasep

It was probably not the best decision to post it without a main for completeness, but whatever, it cant be that big of a problem.p  pYour code took out the portion where the picture was actually displayed. pathtofile was supposed to be replaced by an actual image file path, so you would display the image. Its hard to actually see the issue at hand when its simply text in there.p  pWhen you have the image displayed correctly, and you try to resize the entire GUI, you will notice that the image doesnt shrink. It keeps to its preferred size and has issues when it becomes smaller than it. In my code, it stops displaying the picture completely when it cant display at least the preferred size. In your code, it cuts off part of the picture when it shrinks. p  pWhat I want is for it to actually resize the JLabel containing the picture, so that as the GUI resizes, so will the image. Its necessary that the image shrinks accordingly for my program. The user will eventually have functionality based on clicking the images, so displaying only some images or portions of them simply wont do.p  pPlease try your codemy code again and reproduce the issue Im having, testing with pictures, so that we can find a correct solution. Thanks.p

only the last drawn image can be dragged and dropped All previous images cannot be interacted with.

But I cant get the event to even change the property of isDirty. Let alone implement this idea. Im sure that someone has done something similar and Hope that you could help me.

Negative 11459 pHello all and thanks for your help ahead of time,p  pI have an excel sheet that is solely to take the summation of multiple sheets. Best and most simply put, the formula is something like codesumSheet1A1,Sheet2A1,Sheet3A1,Sheet4A1code. There are a few issues that complicate matters though. First off all, I do not know the number or order of the sheets to sum, nor do I know their name. This formula will be copied into 150 other cells, so I need the summation to be dynamic instead of physically adding sheets to 150 cells every time. Also the configuration and naming of the sheet does not allow for easy dragging for formulas.p  pSo first of all, I thought I could write it using an codeindirectcode reference. I made a column to list all the sheets names that would be added into each cell. Unfortunately, codeconcatenatecode cannot be used over arrays, so I had to resort to a UDF seen belowp  precodeFunction CONCATDelimiter As Variant, ParamArray CellRanges As Variant As String Dim Cell As Range, Area As Variant If IsMissingDelimiter Then Delimiter   For Each Area In CellRanges If TypeNameArea  Range Then For Each Cell In Area If LenCell.Value Then CONCAT  CONCAT amp Delimiter amp Cell.Value Next Else CONCAT  CONCAT amp Delimiter amp Area End If Next CONCAT  MidCONCAT, LenDelimiter  1 End Function codepre  pUsing the UDF, I could get a large string with the proper syntax such as codeCONCATAampB11amp,,ArrayofSheetsampAampB11code. The codeCONCATcode takes a separator as the first parameter and the arrays as the second parameter. I then append the separator on the end of the string as well to output something such as codeSheet1A1,Sheet2A1code. I thought at this point, a simple codesumindirectSTRINGcode would be sufficient, but codesumindirectSheet1A1,Sheet2A1,Sheet3A1,Sheet4A1code does not work since codeindirectcode cannot seemingly process the commas.p  pSo to solve this, I switched the codeCONCATcode to codeCONCATAampB11amp,ArrayofSheetsampAampB11code to output codeSheet1A1Sheet2A1code. Now I wrote another UDF to force it to evaluate seen belowp  precodeFunction EVALRefCell As String Application.Volatile EVAL  EvaluateRefCell End Function codepre  pThis worked Awesome, right After some use and testing though, it seems to not be quite consistent. When we have other sheets open, it does not always evaluate and we will have other sheets open. There is some other inconsistencies that I read about with using codevolatilecode in the UDF, but I cannot find them.p  pSo for my ideal, I would like to do this without any VBA at all, but I suspect that wont be possible. I would rather not depend on the user to manually recalculate worksheets partly the reason for codevolatilecode. Finally, I just want it to codesumcode in a consistent manner so if a user opens the document and just hits print, the user does not need to confirm the functions are evaluating correctly check for REF errors or manually add up the values to make sure they are correct. I am hoping to find an alternative to using the codeevalcode equation.p  pemEDIT for additional information belowemp  pI had experimented with using 3D arrays, but there was a few issues I ran into. Lets say the workbook has eight sheets. Of those eight sheets, only two may feed into this total sheet. There is a codesetupcode sheet, the codetotalcode sheet, a codedata entrycode sheet, and a codedata analysiscode sheet. The codetotalcode sheet totals off of the codedata analysiscode sheets. Typically a codedata entrycode sheet coincides with a codedata analysiscode sheet. So the user may make copies of both the codedata entrycode and the codedata analysiscode sheets. The most logical order of the sheets would begin with the codesetupcode sheet, then each pairing of the codedata entrycode and codedata analysiscode sheets, and the codetotalcode sheet. Obviously, this setup will not work with a 3D array. We would have to reorder the sheets and make sure the user knows that the order of the sheets actually matters an atypical configuration. There will also be instances where one or two codedata analysiscode sheets will not be included in the codetotalcode sheet. So we may end up with a sheet configuration of codesetup  data entry 1  data entry 2  START  data anaylsis 1  data analysis 2   END  totals  data entry 3  data entry 4  data anaylsis 3  data analysis 4code. My feeling was that a 3D array configuration would almost make the addition emtooem dynamic. I would rather have an explicit list then depend on the user being confident in moving the sheets around to have the proper totals.p

I also want to mention possible solution  declaring global variable above without codevarcode. Because of following p  blockquote   pFurthermore, variables that are declared inside a function without the   var keyword are not local to the function  JavaScript will traverse   the scope chain all the way up to the window scope to find where the   variable was previously defined. If the variable wasnt previously   defined, it will be defined in the global scope, which can have   unexpected consequences.p blockquote

Negative 11459 pstrongNote to casual readersstrong Despite the title, this question has nothing to do with the codeUIScrollViewcode properties codebouncescode scrolling related or codebouncesZoomcode.p  pI am using codeUIScrollViewcode to add zooming to a custom view. The custom view uses sublayers to draw its content. Each sublayer is a codeCALayercode instance that is added to the views main layer with code[CALayer addSublayer]code. Sublayers use CoreGraphics to render their  content.p  pAfter each zoom completes, the custom view needs to redraw its content at the new zoom scale so that the content appears crisp and sharp again. I am currently trying to get the approach to work that is shown in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3313947redrawinguiscrollviewcontentsaftereveryzoomthis SO questiona, i.e. I reset the scroll views codezoomScalecode property to 1.0 after each zoom operation, then I adjust the codeminimumZoomScalecode and codemaximumZoomScalecode properties so that the user cannot zoom inout more than originally intended.p  pThe content redrawing already works correctly , but what I am missing is a smooth GUI update so that the zoomed content is redrawn in place without appearing to move. With my current solution code example follows at bottom of this question, I observe a kind of bounce effect As soon as the zoom operation ends, the zoomed content briefly moves to a different location, then immediately moves back to its original location.p  pI am not entirely sure what the reason for the bounce effect is Either there are two GUI update cycles one for resetting codezoomScalecode to 1.0, and another for codesetNeedsDisplaycode, or some sort of animation is taking place that makes both changes visible, one after the other.p  pMy question is How can I prevent the bounce effect described abovep  pstrongUPDATEstrong The following is a minimal but strongcompletestrong code example that you can simply copyamppaste to observe the effect that I am talking

Now i stuck at a point to convert my WPF app project as library that take some constant values from mian program in VB and approximate a shape in 3d.p  pQuestionp  pIs there any way i can use my WPF app project to convert it to a class lib or something that can be used in VBp  pORp  pI have to write new code for VB class libp  pAND alsop  pThe main thing is i also used an external library 3Dtools.dll in WPF, will it include the class library that is to be createdi mean, can a .dll be created which is already using an external .dll p  pI have no strong programing background and couldnt find help regarding this problem. Any link or suggestion will be appreciated. p  pThanks p

Negative 11459 pQuestion Are there any ways of logging or determining where deadlocks occur in an application provided to a client possibly by enabling some flags in the build processp  pBackground Usually when I am testing code and a deadlock occurs, I am running in Visual Studio, so I can hit debug all and find which thread is waiting and where, and I immediately know what the issue is. However, there is a certain issue which causes my application to freeze up very rarely it is not detected in unit or integration tests. This happens on a clients machine where he is only running the executable binary. Im interested in knowing if there are any features I can enable that can help report these issues, since its hard to say exactly would could be the problem without a debugger.p

Negative 11459 pAs a quick note before starting my question, I am quite new to C and especially DLLs.p  pI am currently coding a C DLL in VS2012, for use with a program. Note that I do not have source access to the specific program. Id like to write some output to a seperate console window from the DLL when it gets asked by the program in question to do something.p  pMy question is, how would I go about doing something like this To clarify exactly what I want, Id like a seperate console window to open as soon as the DLL gets attached to the program, and have it then write output to the console. When the DLL gets detached from the program it should also close the console window.p  pMy guesses so far have been to make a seperate Win32 console application project in my solution, and then possibly reference it in my DLL, and have it execute certain methods from it, with the output contained in the arguments of the call. I have no idea how to go about this though, especially since I would want this seperate console project to be included in the same DLL.p  pThanks for any input.p

Negative 11459 pThis question has formed following a previous question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16597279implementiteratordesignpatternusingjdbcImplement Iterator design pattern using JDBCa.p  pI understand the basic concepts of connection pooling but no further than that. My application requires a database that due to the requirements of implementing an iterator pattern i believe the database will need to be opened and closed frequently. Therefore a connection pool is required to prevent significant application lag. Preferably and from my understanding is good practice i would like the pool to open on application start up and shutdown when closed.p  pI have researched a number of connection pool librarys such as BoneCP, DBPool, C3P0 and Proxool. I have seen others described in a hrefhttpjavasource.netopensourceconnectionpools relnofollowhttpjavasource.netopensourceconnectionpoolsa but have not looked further than the basic description.p  blockquote   pMy question is which library has the easiest setup for a simple database that provides an efficient pooling.p blockquote  pBoneCP requires the SLF4J logging library which has problems with eclipse a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13473953eclipsefailedtoloadclassorgslf4jimplstaticloggerbinderEclipse  Failed to load class quotorg.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinderquota which then creates a big problem for me.

Negative 11459 pI am trying to create a virtual magazine line turnjs.com, I Purchesed the commerical version of the library, and all works well when I only have a few pages. But when I try to run the site with book that has 172 images 300 dpi 2550 x 3263 and sized down with CSS  IE stops loading the images after about 50. p  pI though it was a turn.js problem at first, so I stripped out all the turnjs code and wrote a simple js p  precodewindow.loadfunction      forvar i0iltContentArray.lengthi          content.appendltimg src  ContentArray[i]   stylewidth600px height600pxgt         codepre  pContent Array is loaded from an ajax call and it just contains the paths to the images. When the code runs it loads the images up until about 50 or so then it just show the red x. p  pNow My question is, this works in Fire Fox and Chrome but not IE, is there a limit on how many image or better yet the size of the images IE loads. I am only targeting IE9. p  pAny help would be very greatly appreciated. and I know the Images are rather large, I need them to be this large to allow zooming. p  hr  ul liCheck for new versions of stored pages  automaticallyli liDisk space to use 300 MBli liDays to keep pages in history 20li ul  pI thought it may have been my dev machine, but I have checked these settings and I tested this on two different PCs plus a freshly created windows 7 pro virtual Machine. What I have done is lower the DPI on the images, and it loaded more images, but still not all of them, then I lowered further down to 150 DPI and all of the images loaded, the problem with a dpi so low is the text in the images gets very pixelated, and zooming makes for a very unpleasent experiance. p  pDoes anyone know what the limit on IE is when it comes to large images 300k to 500k in size.

Negative 11459 pIm very new to unix programming, so please bear with me.  p  pId like to pass data between two processes.  I was going to use named pipes, but read about these halfduplex pipes, and it was very intriguing, so I figured that I would give them a try first.p  pI have two issues with these pipes thus farp  ol liI havent figured out how to get execlp to run another application from my child processli liEven if I could, debugging is tough because Ive only been able to set breakpoints in the parent processli ol  pIm sure there are reasons for these issues.  I am starting to wonder if it makes sense to just forget about them and just use named pipes so I can debug each application in a separate instance of eclipse.p  pIf there is any relevant information, please let me know.  The code I am using is essentially what it found on a hrefhttpwww.tldp.orgLDPlpgnode11.html relnofollowtldp.orga.p  pEDIT  I renamed my question to be about unix pipes in general.  I had assumed that for named pipes, I wouldnt have to use fork, but all of the examples I have seen so far require it.  So regardless of halfduplex or named pipes, Im going to need to be able to debug the child process somehowp  pEDIT 2  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2784500howtosendasimplestringbetweentwoprogramsusingpipesthis examplea clearly shows that what I had seen before on an IBM link regarding named pipes wasnt necessarily true.p

Negative 11459 pIm using hsqldb to create cached tables and indexed tables. The data being stored has pretty high frequency so I need to use a connection pool. Also because there is a lot of data I do not call checkpoint on every commit, but rather expect the data to be flushed after 50,000 rows are inserted. So the thing is that I can see the .data file is growing but when I connect with hsqldb client I dont see the tables and the data. So I had 2 simple tests, one inserted single row and one inserted 60,000 rows to new table. In both cases I couldnt see the result in any hsqldb client. Note that I use shutdowntrue So when I add checkpoint after each commit, it solve the problem. Also if specify in the connection string to use log, it solves the problem I dont want the log in production though. Also not using pooled connection solved the problem and last is using pooled data source and explicitly close it before shutdown. p  pSo I guess that some connections in the connection pool are not being closed, preventing from the db to somehow commit the changes and make them available for the client. But then, why couldnt I see the result even with 60,000 rows I also would expect the pool to be closed automatically... What am I doing wrong What is happening behind the scenep  pThe code to get the data source looks like thisp  precodeClass.forNameorg.hsqldb.jdbcDriver String url  jdbchsqldb  mdbRoot  dbName  db  hsqldb.logdatafalseshutdowntruehsqldb.niodatafilefalse ConnectionFactory connectionFactory  new DriverManagerConnectionFactoryurl, user, password GenericObjectPool connectionPool  new GenericObjectPool KeyedObjectPoolFactory stmtPool  new GenericKeyedObjectPoolFactorynull new PoolableConnectionFactoryconnectionFactory, connectionPool, stmtPool, null, false, true DataSource ds  new PoolingDataSourceconnectionPool codepre  pAnd Im using this Pooled data source to create tablep  precodeConnection c  mdataSource.getConnection Statement st  c.createStatement String script  String.formatCREATE CACHED TABLE IF NOT EXISTS s id s NOT NULL, entity s NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY id, mtableName, midGenerator.getIdType, TABLEENTITYTYPE st.executescript c.close st.close codepre  pAnd insert rowsp  precodeConnection c  mdataSource.getConnection c.setAutoCommitfalse Statement  stmt  c.prepareStatementmsqlInsert stmt.setObject1, id stmt.setBinaryStream2, Serializer.Helper.serializemserializer, entity stmt.executeUpdate stmt.close stmt  null c.commit c.close stmt.close codepre  pso the above seems to add data but it cannot be seen. When I explicitly called       connectionPool.close Then and only then I could see the result.  I also tried to use JDBCDataSource and it worked as well. So what is going on And what is the right way to do thisp

Negative 11459 pShort version  Im looking for the most efficient way to wrap two queues into one for use in a thread pool where priority is given to the content of one of the queues as long as it is nonempty and then falling back to the second queue.p  pLong version Several thread pools in system, each with their own queue.p  pExternal requests come from the outside and are submitted to one of the pools where it is processed for a while and then transferred to another queue. After the first transfer the request is considered Internal until it is completed. The request may be transferred between all thread pools and may end up in the one it started in.p  pWhat I want to do is if the queue for each thread pool contains Internal requests, they should be processed first until the queue runs out of Internal requests, then it should switch to External ones. If a new Internal shows up, then that should be processed next.p  pDo not need pure FIFO, currently using one LinkedTransferQueue per thread pool because this is the fastest kindofFIFO queue Ive found when it comes to many consumers and many producers. Very high insertion rates and the spinlock in LinkedTransferQueue works amazingly well.p  pSize of queues are handled elsewhere as are rejections, so I really only need proper puttake behavior.p  pPast attempts at solutions that did not work outp  ol liPriorityBlockingQueue  Too slow. Locks are bad, especially on my hardware for some reason. 2.4 ghz quad core laptop almost outperforms 2x 2.0ghz hexacore serverli liManually wrapping two LinkedBlockingQueue  Worked fine, but was also too slow. Using ONE LinkedBlockingQueue is also too slow.li liManually wrapping two ArrayBlockingQueue  Same as LinkedBlockingQueue.li ol  pThoughts on solutionp  ul liManually merging two LinkedTransferQueues... but after looking at the code for it Im afraid Im not smart enough to do that without breaking something.li liSpinning for a while, doing a peek on both queues until I find something... This is basically a spinlock, and I guess I could do this for a while, but I think Id want the same behaviour as LinkedTransferQueue, that is. Spin for a while, then yield or sleep for a while. But I have no way of waking up. EDIT Id really prefer if I could avoid real locksli ul  pCant just do a peek on External and if null block on Internal instead, because something might be inserted into External and Ill be blocked waiting on Internal. Ill never unblock from Internal since things cant end up in Internal unless I process them in from External... Same way if I turn it 180 degrees except itll come from inside the systemp  pMy apologies for a post that makes no sense...p

Negative 11459 pI know this is a weird one but bear with me.  I need to set a default statevalue for form inputs on a portion of my application.p  pIn my MainController I pull up a portion or wrapper of sorts page and then pull partial views from this main page.  Heres a pseudocode examplep  pcodeUser goes to Main gtcodep  pcodeMainControllerIndex Calledcodep  pcodegt User clicks Link A gtcodep  pcodeAJAX .load pulls html from PartialViewA into partialContainercodep  pcodegt User clicks Link B gtcodep  pcodeAJAX .load pulls html from PartialViewB into partialContainercodep  pHeres the AJAX callp  precodemainPanel.loadUrl.ActionGetModule,Settings  partialName  moduleName codepre  p...and the corresponding serverside action that handles itp  precodepublic ActionResult GetModulestring partialName      return PartialViewpartialName  codepre  pIt works great for me, each of the modules has plenty of form fields on them, all interacting well with one another and server so that isnt my problem.  The issue is setting default values from the dbase for the form fields contained in the partial views.p  pFor instance the General partial has many checkboxes which will determine how portions of the application display.  I want to pull from the database the preexisiting boolean value and when the partial gets pulled from GetModule, have these values defaulted.p  pIve taken a look around and Im afraid the way that I am pulling the partials into the main page may be the issue.  I thought I could build the defaults into the constructor like sop  precodepublic class GeneralViewModel      public GeneralViewModel              var Data  from m in dataContext.Table                    where m.UserID  id                    select new                                            m.Data1,                        m.Data2,                              foreachvar setting in Data                      Checkbox1  Convert.ToBooleansetting.Data1  Conversion from bool to bool             Checkbox2  Convert.ToBooleansetting.Data2  Conversion from bool to bool                    public bool Checkbox1  get set      public bool Checkbox2  get set   codepre  pBut it would appear the constructor never gets called.  That sort of makes sense, except when you consider the fact that my form fields are not only rendering properly, but communicating with the database just fine as well.  So the question is, what am I doing wrong  Is it the way I call the Partials or am I missing something with assigning values to my VM valuesp  pAs always, thanks SOp

Negative 11459 pIve noticed that sometimes when a user tries to view a GameCenter leaderboard in my app they get a blank white screen with the error unable to load data due to network connectivity issues or errors. This happens when all other connectivity is fine i.e. on wifi, web pages load, email load etc. It happens maybe 20 of the time. Im not sure if I might be doing something wrong or if Game Center is just weird like that. It definitely fails to load more often than an HTTP request and does not seem to retry. Closing the leaderboards and reopening usually fixes it, but I have numerous complains about this from my users so I just thought Id ask here to see if it is a known issue.

Negative 11459 pOkay, so I should start off by saying we sort of found a way around this by generating null values for every line except the one being drawn. The idea is that were drawing power levels y and frequency x, but these values shouldnt overlap except in a very rare case. C and ASP.NET charts would work well for this, but were trying to move away from them since Googles Visualization API is cleaner, easier to work with and maintain, and faster. p  pI tried formatting the JSON so that there were multiple rows and columns so it looked likep  precode   cols [id A, label NEW A, type string,          id B, label Blabel, type number,          id C, label Clabel, type date         ],   rows [c[v a, v 1.0, f One, v new Date2008, 1, 28, 0, 31, 26, f 22808 1231 AM],          c[v b, v 2.0, f Two, v new Date2008, 2, 30, 0, 31, 26, f 33008 1231 AM],          c[v c, v 3.0, f Three, v new Date2008, 3, 30, 0, 31, 26, f 43008 1231 AM]         ],   cols [id A, label NEW A, type string,          id B, label Blabel, type number,          id C, label Clabel, type date         ],   rows [c[v a, v 1.0, f One, v new Date2008, 1, 28, 0, 31, 26, f 22808 1231 AM],          c[v b, v 2.0, f Two, v new Date2008, 2, 30, 0, 31, 26, f 33008 1231 AM],          c[v c, v 3.0, f Three, v new Date2008, 3, 30, 0, 31, 26, f 43008 1231 AM]         ],  codepre  pUnfortunately, I determined that this would only draw the final line displayed in the JSON, which if you think about the way CSS chooses things kind of makes sense for JavaScript, too.p  pI also tried multiple row sets for a single column set and it sort of worked, but it connected the lines. As I said, theres a case where this is undesirable as there are occasionally lines which share the same x values and cause the line to reach its terminal point and draw a connecting line back to the beginning of the next point.p  pStill, it seems a bit ridiculous that x values would have to overlap. Has anyone found a way to draw multiple lines, treat things as separate series, or add points by x and y value alone with a corresponding legend item I havent found anything like this in their API or SO. p

Negative 11459 pI recently modified my iOS app to enable serialized mode for both a database encrypted using SQLCipher and a nonencrypted database also SQLite. I also maintain a static sqlite3 connection for each database, and each is only opened once by simply checking for null values and shared throughout the lifetime of the app.p  pThe app is required to have a synclike behavior which will download a ton of records from a remote database at regular intervals using a soap request and update the contents of the local encrypted database. Of course, the person using the app may or may not be updating or reading from the database, depending on what theyre doing, so I made the changes mentioned in the above paragraph.p  pWhen doing short term testing, there doesnt appear to be any issue with how things work, and Ive yet experience any problem.p  pHowever, some users are reporting that theyve lost access to the encrypted database, and Im trying to figure out why.p  pMy thoughts are as follows Methods written by another developer declared all sqlite3stmts to be static I believe this code was in the problematic release. In the past Ive noticed crashes when two threads using a particular method run simultaneously. One thread finalizes, modifies or replaces a sqlite3stmt while another thread is using it. A crash doesnt always occur because he has wrapped most of his SQLite code in trycatch blocks. If its true that SQLite uses prepare and finalize to implement locking, could the orphaning of sqlite3stmts which occurs due to their static nature in this context be putting the database into an inoperable state For example, when a statement acquires an exclusive lock after being stepped is replaced by an assignment in the same method running in another threadp  pI realize that this doesnt necessarily mean that the database will become permanently unusable, but, consider this scenariop  pAt some point during the apps lifetime it will rekey the encrypted database and that key is stored in another database. Suppose that it successfully rekeys the encrypted database, but then the new key is not stored in the other database because of what I mentioned above. Provided that the database hasnt become corrupted at some point Im not really counting on this being the case, this is the only explanation I can come up with for why the user may not be able to use the encrypted database after restarting the iOS app, seeing as the app would be the only one to access the database file.p  pBeing that I cant recreate this issue, I can only speculate about what the reasoning might be. What thoughts do you have Does this seem like a plausible scenario for something that happens rarely Do you have another idea of something to look intop

Negative 11459 pIve been implimenting undo features for my cocoa app OS 10.9,  and I have successfully implemented an instance of an undo feature using NSUndoManager. However, I cannot get the Undo text to change under the edit menu I am using the setActionName method as detailed in Apples docs. My relevant methodp  precode voidFinishEditingName   [[self UndoManager] registerUndoWithTarget[self TestObject] selectorselectorsetName object[NSString stringWithFormatTesting Undo]] [[self UndoManager] setActionNameEdit Name]  [[self TestObject] setName[NSString stringWithFormatNew Name]]  NSLog[NSString stringWithFormat,[[self UndoManager] undoActionName]]   codepre  pAgain, the undo works perfectly, i.e. code[[self TestObject] Name]code is set New Name on calling this method, selecting Edit  Undo changes this to Testing Undo. However, the Edit menus first entry should change to the text Undo Edit Name, but it doesnt, it just stays as Undo. As you can see, Ive confirmed that the text emshouldem change by spitting it out with NSLog, which works just fine i.e. it gives Edit Name. What am am missing here Do I need to link the NSUndoManager to the NSMenu somehow If so, this is missing from the docsp  pThanks in advancep
Negative 11459 pTo make the question clear is the proposal below considered secure i.e. doesnt introduce any significant security risks.p  pI havent seen any clear reason why the following proposal would be considered completely insecure as in, dont even bother, which seems to be the quick answer to anything with the words local storage and secure in the title. Fundamentally, its based on the premise that either you have access to the sensitive data in memory AND the cache, or you have access to neither.p  h2The Starting Pointh2  pI have a web application which includes serverside web services and javascript running in the browser which calls those web services securely, over HTTPS, thats not the issue here and displays the data in the web page. Lets say its an email application that displays your emails  i.e. its sensitive data that you dont want to share with others. p  pA couple of points to note at this stagep  ul liThe user has authenticated with the server and the javascript running in the browser is capable of calling the servers web services to the retrieve the data.li liThe javascript running in the browser also has access to the page and all of the sensitive information is available to that javascript. The sensitive data is in memory  and available to the javascript yes, including any malicious injected javascript.li ul  pUp to this point, its a standard web application, and Im assuming that anybody reading would be comfortable that this is considered acceptably secure.p  h2Adding a Secure Cacheh2  pThe problem is every time a user visits the site, their browser needs to download all of the email information, most of which is the same each time. Wouldnt it be nice if instead of needing to ask the server for all of the information each time, it could cache the data in the browser and check the cache. Bear in mind this is not offline access the browser is still talking securely to the server, but it may use data stored in a browserside cache rather than retrieving it all from the server.p  pHeres the proposalp  ul liWhen the browser retrieves the data, it also retrieves a long, random, servergenerated key. This key is stored against the user, securely, on the server.li liIn the browser, this key sits alongside the sensitive data in javascript memory.li liThe browser uses the key it was given by the server and an accepted cryptographic algorithm e.g. SHA256, encrypts the data it has in memory, and put it in local storage.li liWhen the user closes the browser, or navigates away from the site, or logs out, the browser no longer displays the sensitive information, and the key is also lost alongside it.li lipThe implication is that once the page is gone or very shortly after, the ability for the browser, or anyone with any level of access to it, to decrypt the contents of the cache is local storage is gone. In order to do so, they would need the key if they had the key, they would already have access to the data itself in the browserjavascript memory.pli lipWhen the user later returns to the site, they need to again authenticate with the server in order to retrieve data via the web services.pli liAt the same time, the javascript retrieves the same key from the server, which it can now use to access the cache in local storage.li liPresumably, there could be a process of the server introducing a new key over time in order to avoid the same key being used indefinitely.li ul  pAny thoughts p  pFor what its worth, bear in mind that I have readp  ul lia hrefhttpwww.matasano.comarticlesjavascriptcryptography relnofollowJavascript Crypto Considered Harmfulali liThe similar SO questions a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17280390canlocalstorageeverbeconsideredsecureherea, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5555167howsecureishtml5localstorageforamobiledeviceherea, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12087790securityoflocalstoragehtml5onmobileherea,  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17280390canlocalstorageeverbeconsideredsecureherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17496384whatarethesecurityimplicationsofhtml5localstorageforcreditcardinfoherea.li ul  pso Im at least aware that the concerns around javascript  local storage  securityp

Then, I create a pool of workers to perform the codeupdateParamcode function on each JSON within codedatacode, as each one of those corresponds to an individual telnet address two which commands need to be sent. Within codeupdateParamcode, I open a telnet connection to the devices IP address, as well as opening a code.txtcode file to keep a log of what is sent and received. I write the command to the telnet connection, and thats where I hit the error.p  pI am able to send commands that dont require a value from the json, but when I try to use the json value, I get the codeUnicodeDecodeErrorcode. I am able to write the values to my code.txtcode file as well without issue.p  pWhy am I getting this error specifically when I try to write those values to a telnet connectionp  pEDIT I went into the javascript that sends the JSON through cgi and attempted to remove all nonascii characters from the json before sending the cgi request. This did not work. I was unable to find any nonascii characters in particular the  that seemed to be causing problems when I had the javascript alert the stringified json before sending the request as well. Then I implemented the solution found in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions956867howtogetstringobjectsinsteadofunicodeonesfromjsoninpython66336516633651this questiona and it appears to be working correctly.p

Negative 11459 pI have a doubt concerning the vertexdescriptor used to access on a vertex in a graph. In a previous implementation of my own, I used pointers on vertices like a way to access directly on a vertex. I could implement a map if I want access an IDVertex by an integer or something else.p  pBut in BGL, I dont understand why a vertexdescriptor is an integer  I know it makes sens with a vector. But if I want to use a wide set of vertices like 106 and be able to remove any vertex of the set, I use a map. Plus, in my game, I want to be able to refering each node by the pointer integer which is more logical p  pHow BGL works to link an integer with a vertex in a norandomaccesscontainer like stdset  The access method is always logn no  Can you explain me if there is a mecanism to keep handle directly on a vertex without keeping a vertexdescirptor p  pSorry for my bad english p

Negative 11459 pI would like to avoid Impala nodes unnecessarily requesting data from other nodes over the network in cases when the strongideal data locality or layout is knownstrong at table creation time.

Negative 11459 pHere is a short selfcontained test case to explain my question. GCC accepts this code, but clang and Intel reject itp  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt struct falset    static const bool value  false  template lttypename Tgt int f    staticassertfalsetltTgtvalue,    return 0  template lttypename Tgt struct S    int m  fltTgt  int s  sizeofSltintgt codepre  pOr, based on pmrs comment, here is a simpler example which too is accepted by gcc and rejected by clangp  precodestruct S template lttypename Tgt struct X  int x  T  int s  sizeofXltSgt codepre  pcodesizeofSltintgtcode or codesizeofXltSgtcode is supposed to instantiate the bits of the class it needs, but the compilers disagree on which bits those are. Since a nonstatic data member initializer would only be used by a constructor, GCC performs the instantiation as part of instantiating the classs constructor. clang and Intel do so earlier.p  pIm having trouble understanding what the standard says in [temp.inst]p1p  blockquote   pThe implicit instantiation of a class template specialization causes the implicit   instantiation of the declarations, but not of the definitions or default arguments, of the class member functions, member classes, scoped member enumerations, static data members and member templates and it causes the implicit instantiation of the definitions of unscoped member enumerations and member anonymous unions.p blockquote  pbecause I dont see where even the declarations of the nonstatic data members with or without initialisers get instantiated at all.p  pA bit more details about where I encountered this I was trying to create a template helper class that would never be created at runtime containing a member initialised using codestddeclvalltTgtcode which, I should add, I now realise wouldnt be of much use anyway, and libstdcs implementation of codestddeclvalcode contains a static assertion like the one in my example. I can work around the problem without much effort by avoiding codestddeclvalcode, but I would like to know what the standard requires.p

Negative 11459 pI have been reading about the tree protocol as an approach in locking management in databases.

Hence deadlock.br What am I misunderstanding in the algorithmp

Negative 11459 pI made a script to create files with random data in them mostly based on dd in order to do performance testing of a caching server. I need to periodically update these files. The cache server will read the first 1000 bytes of a file and if it recognize it, it will serve the content from the cache instead of some server far away on the internet.p  pIt order to speed up the recreation of the new files, I need to simply update the first 1000 bytes.  How can I open a file and update the first 1000 bytes with random data I want to avoid creating a chunk of 1000 random bytes and append the rest of the original file. This means rewriting the original file on the disk and its too slow.p  pI dont think its possible to use dd for that. It looks like dd is going to write a new file anyway. Correct me if I am wrong.p  pWhat are my options I wouldnt mind doing this in Python but I am a beginner... not sure this is the easiest to start with.p

Negative 11459 pHow do I run an external command via a shell from a Java program, such that no redirection takes place, and wait for the command to end I want the file descriptors of the external program to be the same as those of the Java program. In particular strongI do not want the output to be redirected to a pipe that the Java program is readingstrong. Having the Java program relay the output is not a solution.p  pThis means that a plain invocation of a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavalangRuntime.htmlexec28java.lang.String29 relnofollowcodejava.lang.Runtime.execcodea is not the solution. I presume that a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavalangProcessBuilder.html relnofollowcodejava.lang.ProcessBuildercodea is involved, but how do I specify that output and error streams must be the same as the calling Java processp  precodeclass A      public static void mainString[] args          try              ProcessBuilder pb  new ProcessBuilderecho, foo             TODO pb.out  System.out pb.err  System.err             Process p  pb.start             p.waitFor          catch Exception e              System.err.printlne             System.exit1                codepre  pThis may or may not be the right approach.p  pIn other words, strongIm looking for Javas codesystemcode, but all I can find is roughly codepopencode.strongp  pHeres an example of a situation where relaying cannot work if the subprocess writes to both stdout and stderr and the Java program is relaying, then the Java program has no way to know the order of the codewritecode calls in the subprocess. So the order of the output on stdout and stderr from the Java program will be observably different if the two streams end up in the same file. Mixing stdout and stderr is of course not a solution because the caller may want to keep them separate.p  pWhile I think this question is of general interest, a Linuxspecific solution would solve my immediate problem.p

Negative 11459 pI have a question regarding browser remote controlling. My primary goal is to read out all open tab URLs from Google Chrome and also focus a tab if a matching URL is found and reload the current page. All this stuff is invoked from the native application not from Chrome to the native application.p  pCurrently, Ive tried to do with Win32API stuff FindWindowEx, ..., new .NET Automation stuff, but this just gives me nothing the former or only the URL of the current tab the latter.p  pSo I thought  based on research  it would be the best idea to write a Google Chrome Extension and interact this way. The sad thing about this is NPAPI extensions are no longer supported and only the JavaScriptkinda stuff is supported right now.p  pI then tried to communicate using nativeMessaging but I cant get things to work never gets executed somehow and the documentation part about this is censored.p  pThis leads me to the question if things are even possible and if yes, how are they possiblep  pbrp  pHost application, registered in the registry Windowsp  precodepublic static void Mainstring[] args      string message  text My response     byte[] length  BitConverter.GetBytesmessage.Length     foreach byte b in length              Console.Writecharb          Console.Writemessage  codepre  pManifest for the host applicationp  precode   name My.ChromeHost,   description This extension is used for browser interaction with My App.,   version 1.0,   path CProgram Files x86My Company AGMy ProductMy.ChromeHost.exe,   type stdio,   allowedorigins [     chromeextensionbejoalmncckddamdhnfjafipbgflolmk   ]  codepre  pManifest for extensionp  precode   manifestversion 2,   name My App,   description This extension is used for browser interaction with My App.,   version 1.0,   background      scripts [         background.js     ],     persistent false   ,   permissions [     tabs,     nativeMessaging   ]  codepre  pbackground.jsp  precode sending a message to the app altough I need it vice versa var port  chrome.runtime.connectNativeMy.ChromeHost port.onMessage.addListeneronNativeMessage port.onDisconnect.addListeneronDisconnected port.postMessage text My request   function onNativeMessagemessage      alertReceived message ltbgt  JSON.stringifymessage  ltbgt   function onDisconnected      alertFailed to connect   chrome.runtime.lastError.message     port  null  codepre

Negative 11459 pI need to connect an iOS device iDevice to a WiFi access port but keep using the cellular data connection.p  pDefault behavior is for iOS to set the WiFi connection as the default gateway, routing all internet traffic there. In my case the access point is a black box device supplying a WiFi network to access its services, but not the internet. p  pOne solution which we have tried, is to make the iDevice the access point hot spot and have the black box device connect though it. This is far less desirable as the black box device has no UI. So it is difficult to setup.  We have lessened the pain by using Bonjour but still...p  pIs it possible to make a system call iOS application to restore the gateway setting back to the cellular gateway after the iDevice joins a WiFi networkp  pWould be even better if there is some way to setup the iDevice IPhone or IPad to maintain its cellular gateway after connecting to a WiFi access point.p

Negative 11459 pI think of myself as an experienced ObjectiveC programmer. I do apps for a living, and use the language features to its fullest. That includes using the runtime for varies justintime changes to existing frameworks. Stuff like method swizzling and dynamic subclassing really shows how this language is so much more versatile than its other object oriented C counterpart.p  pBut lately Ive been having some thoughts about an old feature, that I still find myself in need of using from time to time, but has been deprecated for some time now. Its a replacement for the old codeclasssetSuperClasscode.p  pI often find myself subclassing UIKit classes in order to extend them or just change their behaviour slightly. One example I came across recently was an codeUIScrollViewcode subclass, that made some conditions to the codepanGestureRecognizercode. I did that by subclassing codeUIScrollViewcode and then implementing the codegestureRecognizershouldBeRequiredToFailByGestureRecognizercode.p  pThis had to be done this way, because youre not allowed to change the delegate of a scroll views pan gesture recogniser it will throw a runtime exception, and you cannot create your own custom UIScrollView codepanGestureRecognizercode.p  pNow this all worked out great. I changed all usages of codeUIScrollViewcode in my app to my newly created subclass, and everything worked as expected. But what about codeUITableViewcode and codeUICollectionViewcode which I also used throughout the app. What to do with those As you know, both of these classes is inherited from codeUIScrollViewcode, but not my custom subclass of codeUIScrollViewcode. So I found myself ending up writing emthe same code multiple timesem for every class that existed and was used in the app that inherited from codeUIScrollViewcode. Writing the same code multiple times is a programmers 123 nogo. But I did end up writing a custom subclass not only for codeUIScrollViewcode but also for codeUITableViewcode and codeUICollectionViewcode.p  pNow in the old days with the codeclasssetSuperClasscode you were able to emswizzleem the superclass of an already prepackaged class like codeUITableViewcode. You basically just said codeclasssetSuperClass[UITableView class], [MyScrollView class]code, and everything worked out well almost fine. Now you had injected your own class in between codeUITableViewcode and codeUIScrollViewcode. So every time you did code[[UITableView alloc] init]code it would have the features of codeMyScrollViewcode because it inherited directly from it.p  pNow codeclasssetSuperClasscode was deprecated in iOS 2.0 Since that we could do some swizzling and hacking with the objects codeisacode pointer. Now that has been deprecated too.p  pSo my question is really simple. How would you approach thisp

Negative 11459 pI have just started experimenting with building a website using node.js, and I am encountering an issue when organizing the models of my project.p  pAll the real world examples I have found on the Internet are using Mongoose. This library allows you to define your models in a static way. So you can write thisp  precode modelsfoo.js module.exports  requiremongoose.modelFoo, ...   app.js mongoose.connect...   somecontroller1.js var Foo  require.modelsfoo Foo.find...   somecontroller2.js var Foo  require.modelsfoo Foo.find... codepre  pBut since I dont want to use MongoDB, I need another ORM. And all the other ORMs I have found dont allow this. You first need to create an instance, and then only you can register your models. Also they dont seem to allow access to the list of registered models.p  pSo I tried doing thisp  precode modelsuser.js var registrations  [] module.exports  functionsequelize      var result  null     registrations.forEachfunctionelem          if elem.db  sequelize             result  elem.value          if result return result        data definition     var user  sequelize.defineUser, ...       registrations.push db sequelize, value user      return user  codepre  pWhich I can use this likep  precode somecontroller1.js var Foo  require.modelsfooapp.getdatabase Foo.find...   using Foo codepre  pBut these small header and footer that I have to write on every single model file are a bit annoying and directly violate the dont repeat youself principle. Also, while not a huge issue, this is kind of a memory leak since the sequelize object will never be freed.p  pIs there a better way to do, which I didnt think aboutp

Negative 11459 pUnder .Net 4.5 and VB.Net Web Forms, I have a dynamicallygenerated codeDropDownListcode ddlDocumentTypeId which, when a user chooses a different item in it, should trigger an codeUpdatePanelcode udpCustomerDocumentActivities, of which strongthe DropDownList is not a partstrong to be PostedBack and thereby refreshed  representing a sort of masterdetail screen arrangement.  However, I cannot seem to find a way to get this to occur.  Things Ive triedp  pDynamically creating an codeAsyncPostBackTriggercode and adding it to the UpdatePanels codeTriggerscode collection in PageInit as was suggested in a hrefhttpforums.asp.nett1080372.aspx relnofollowhttpforums.asp.nett1080372.aspxa p  precodeDim asyncTrigger As New AsyncPostBackTrigger asyncTrigger.ControlID  ddlDocumentTypeId.ID asyncTrigger.EventName  SelectedIndexChanged udpCustomerDocumentActivities.Triggers.AddasyncTrigger codepre  pThe code above definitely gets processed as, for example, misspelling SelectedIndexChanged throws an exception but changing the item in the DropDownList does not cause the UpdatePanel to refresh.  Which upon inspection of the generated HTML makes sense, as there is no JavaScript codeonchangecode being attached to the DropDownList as one would need to trigger some sort of action. p  pI then found a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comQuestions69384UpdatePanelTriggerregistrationfordynamiccontr relnofollowhttpwww.codeproject.comQuestions69384UpdatePanelTriggerregistrationfordynamiccontra which suggests that dynamically adding AsyncPostBackTrigger isnt supported. It then suggests adding something akin top  precodeScriptManager.GetCurrentMe.Page.RegisterAsyncPostBackControlddlDocumentTypeId codepre  pBut, this doesnt seem to generate any JavaScript in the HTML either and, its not clear how this would tie the DropDownList to the UpdatePanel.p  pOther informationp  ul lipIn my PageInit Im always creatingrecreating the DropDownList dynamically as well as executing the code Ive listed in the approaches above.pli lipWhen I FindControl the DropDownList in PageLoad via the debugger, it looks like the results of the code Ive listed in the approaches above seems to still be in effect.pli lipFor test purposes Ive also added a separate codeButtoncode both inside and outside the UpdatePanel and declaratively set it to trigger the UpdatePanel  and this works fine with the necessary codeonclickcode JavaScript being generated.pli lipFinally, as a test Ive programmatically set the DropDownLists codeAutoPostBackcode to True and, when I do, it indeed generates a JavaScript codeonchangecode which refreshes the entire page, as expected.pli ul  pSo, my question is strongwhat am I missing to in order to trigger a refresh of an UpdatePanel on SelectedIndexChange of a dynamicallycreated DropDownListstrongp
Negative 11459 pHello everyone I just started learning C through THE c PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE Second Edition by Brian. W.Kernighnan ISBN13 9788131704943p  pSo here is a script which counts the characters, line, wordsp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  define IN  1 define OUT 0  main      int c, nl, nw, nc, state       c  input, nl  new line, nc  new character, nw  new word, state  INOUT      state  OUT     nl  nw  nc  0     while c  getchar  EOF              nc         if c  n             nl         if c     c  n  c  t             state  OUT         else if state  OUT                      state  IN             nw                   printf The number of lines is d,n The number of words is d,n The number of characters is d. n, nl, nw, nc  codepre  pHowever I made a script which does the following without the need of defining state IN and OUTp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt main      int nw, nl, nc, c      nl  nw  nc  c  0      while c  getchar  EOF              nc         if c  n             nl         else if c     c  n  c  t             nw          printfWordsd nCharactersd nLinesd, nw, nc, nl  codepre  pSo what is the difference between these two, why does the author use the state to define IN and OUT p  p[EDIT] Oh I see so the script is just to avoid two things  1. To avoid word count when there are more than one spaces following the word. 2. Secondly my script would count n2 words I suppose if proper spacing is done. Which makes the authors script more fullproof.....Is there anything else except these two p  pAnd thank You for your answes too....p  pP.S Im sorry this is a bit offtopic is it ok to label the question [SOLVED] or is there any other way of doing this p

Negative 11459 pI was reading this SO question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma44027612379703httpstackoverflow.coma44027612379703a and the last post showing the rails coderendercode impl was interesting.  Its signature isp  precodedef renderoptions  , locals  , ampblock codepre  pIf the first argument is a plain string, it assigns that to options and the rest is interpreted as a hash and assigned to locals.  For examplep  precoderenderpartialname, key value, key2, value2 codepre  pWhich results inp  precodeoptions  partialname locals  key value, key2, value2 codepre  pIf you just pass keyvalue pairs, it assumes you passed a single argument of a hash and assigns it all to options and leaves locals emptyp  prenderpartial partialname, key value, key2, value2p  pWhich results inp  precodeoptions  partial partialname, key value, key2, value2 locals   codepre  pSo my question really comes down to is What is the logic that ruby uses to figure out which parameter gets assigned what when there are multiple optional parameters  Furthermore, it seems that hashes make the answer to this question more interesting since hashes clearly dont need to be delimited with outer  when passed in as arguments.p  pA secondary observation, in a test where I used the same signature for a test method like render, and I passed the following inp  precoderenderkey value, key2 value2, string codepre  pAnd that results in a syntax errorp  precodetesthashparam.rb15 syntax error, unexpected , expecting gt codepre  pWhy is this  Why doesnt it assign the two keyvalue pairs to options and sets locals to stringp  pHowever this works as I assumed it wouldp  precoderenderkey value, key2 value2, string codepre

Negative 11459 pI have recently sarted using angular and I have a quick question. I cant seem to find a direct answer through searching its very possible Im searching it wrong so bear with me. p  pI am building a rather large single page web app and at my first stab at it I noticed the javascript was causing a memory leak. I realized it was because I was bringing in new javascript with each page change in the new content brought in via ajax, and it was sitting in a detached dom tree. p  pI am trying a second approach where I use angular for an incredible amount of reasons  mainly it makes making these apps a million times easier. But I a wondering how angular addresses this issue. p  pLets say I run all my functionality through angular except things like fancy animationstransitions. If i had scripts for each new page on each page, would I have the same issue using angular Is there a better way to handle this andor manage javascript usage on a SPAp  pAny direction would be much appreciated, thanksp

Negative 11459 pIm developing a gem for use in a Rails 4 application that include a bit of code to be run as an initializer for the host application.

Also, as far as I can tell, no initializer code from my gem is ever run it would fail since the class wasnt defined. When I coderequire mygemcode, then codeMyGemMyClasscode is then defined. Ive taken a look at a number of rails plugins and railtie tutorials and they all say to just add the gem to your Gemfile and everything should just work. Can anyone spot what Im doing wrongp

Negative 11459 pIm running into quite a strange behaviour using Linq to Entity code first. p  pAll my entities, context, databases are working fine, its an ongoing project that is developped, updated and online for two years.

For that specific query, LazyLoading is disabled not that activating it changes anything.p  pI have the following tables Im only mentionning what is related to the issue  p  ul liGames, which holds the gamesli liPress, which holds press articles about gamesli liPressTypes, which holds the categories for a press articleli liPressGames, which defines a one to many between Press to Games one article can be about many gamesli ul  pAbout the tables and their matching entity  p  ul liGames has many fields, but lets say that it just holds two  ID guid and Name, the games name. li liPress also has many fields, amongst which we have  ID guid, CategoryID guid and UpdateDate DateTime that represents the last time the article has been updated.li liPress Entity has a Category Object, and an IEnumerable Games.li liGame Entity does NOT have a Press navigation property intended and needed this wayli liPressTypes is the list of the press article categories, and has an ID guidli liPressGames has two fields, GameID guid and PressID guidli ul  pI need to get the list of the 5 games that are linked to the latest press articles of a specific category. I retrieve them through the following query  p  precodeContext.Press     .Wherepress gt press.Category.ID  MagicValues.ReviewGuid  MagicValues.ReviewGuid returns a Guid     .OrderByDescendingpress gt press.UpdateDate     .SelectManypress gt press.Games     .Take5 codepre  pThe resulting list get a list of games, but not the one matching the expected chronological articles order. Using LINQPad I noticed that the generated query is the following  p  precodeSELECT TOP 5  [Join1].[ID] AS [ID],  [Join1].[Name] AS [Name],  FROM  [dbo].[Press] AS [Extent1] INNER JOIN  SELECT [Extent2].[PressID] AS [PressID], [Extent3].[ID] AS [ID]  lots of selected fields      FROM  [dbo].[PressGames] AS [Extent2]     INNER JOIN [dbo].[Games] AS [Extent3] ON [Extent3].[ID]  [Extent2].[GameID]  AS [Join1] ON [Extent1].[ID]  [Join1].[PressID] WHERE castb5c1818314e24bf2b4e1641b56694c55 as uniqueidentifier  [Extent1].[CategoryID] codepre  pNo ORDER BY. If I alter slightly the query to select the articles instead of the games, I get the proper list of articles, and their games, in the expected order  p  precodeContext.Press     .Includepress gt press.Games     .Wherepress gt press.Category.ID  MagicValues.ReviewGuid  MagicValues.ReviewGuid returns a Guid     .OrderByDescendingpress gt press.UpdateDate     .Take25 codepre  pThe generated SQL query becomes  p  precodeSELECT  [Project2].[C1] AS [C1],  [Project2].[ID] AS [ID],  [Project2].[Name] AS [Name],  FROM        Lots of irrelevant stuff with JOINs and SELECTs    AS [Project2] ORDER BY [Project2].[UpdateDate] DESC, [Project2].[ID] ASC, [Project2].[C2] ASC codepre  pI get the ORDER BY back which was more or less expected as its working. p  pstrongSo finaly my question is  is this behavior expected or is it a bug strong p  pIm thinking that since Im using SelectMany, EF seems to think that only the Games table is required and thus ignore the OrderBy on Press. It could make sense, but seems a bit counterintuitive. p  pIll find a way to circumvent the issue unless there is actually a clean fix for this but Im mostly curious about the behavior and the explanation. p

Negative 11459 pThere is an application that Im basically writing with Swing, JDBC and MySQL.p  ul liIn DB there are tables like Article, Company, Order, Transaction, Client etc.li liSo also there are java classes which describes them. li liUser can create,    update, delete information about them.li ul  pI give an example of my problem. The article characterizes with id, name, price, company, unit. And when user wants to save new article he chooses the company for this article from the list of all companies. This list in perspective could be really big.p  pNow I could think of two ways to solve this.p  ol lipWhen application starts, it connects to the DB and load all the data with which then I will work.p  precodepublic final class AllInformationController  public static final CollectionltCompanygt COMPANIES new HashSetltgt1000000 public static final CollectionltArticlegt ARTICLES new HashSetltgt1000000 public static final CollectionltOrdergt ORDERS new HashSetltgt1000000 public static final CollectionltTransactiongt transactionsHistory new HashSetltgt10000000 etc... private AllInformationController   codepre  pThen if user wants for example to change some Company data like address or telephone etc., after doing it the program should update the DB info for that company.pli lipThe second approach is basically to connect to the database every time user queries or changes some information. So then I will mostly work with codeResultSetscode.pli ol  pI prefer the second way, but just not sure if its the best one. Think there should be more productive ways to work with data that could be less expensive.p

Negative 11459 pi have been working with lwjgl and also j3d for the geometry part. i am still working on the collision. what i have so far witht he collision is working decently but there are 2 problems. to sum up my current way of colliding, it tests if the previous coordinate and current coordinate go through a trianglewhat things are rendered as and then it finds the point on the triangle that it just intersected that is closest to your current coordinate and makes you go there. it also makes your y coordinate go up by .001. this workd descent but going up .001 is bad becuase if you go to a triangle that is at a 90 angle going updards you can go left to rigth but you cant back up out of it, almost as if you are stuck in it. here is a drawing of how it works on imgurp  pa hrefhttpi.imgur.com1gMhRut.png relnofollowhttpi.imgur.com1gMhRut.pngap  pfrom here i want to add say .001 to the length between the current coordinate and the closest point i already know these points and get the new current point.p  pbtw prev is where the person was at before they moved to the cur point and then it tests to see if those 2 points intersect a triangle and then i get the closest point to the prev if it does which is defined as closest in the picture. i can already calculate for all of those pointsp

Negative 11459 pIm working on a uboot test application that will work with a special DMA engine. The DMA engine will transfer data between memories without notify cache. Therefore, I expect that if I keep transferring different data to the same destination, I should get the stale data.p  pHowever, I found that I always get the correct data the DMA engine sent. This makes me think that maybe the dcache is not enabled. So I tried the uboot buildin cmd  dcache. It shows my data cache is enabled. And I checked the TLB table and all pages are marked as write back write allocate. So it means the cache is enabledp  pAnd more interesting thing I found is that, I wrote a simple program that just keeps reading the same address. And I found that by disabling the dcache using the dcache cmd, the time to run the test just tripled. I tried a similar simple test in Linux on the same hardware and the cache can enable more than 15 times performance boost. So this must not be a hardware issue.p  pIn summary, I found that my cache is working to some extent but not fully working. And it might be a configuration issue. Is there any theory can explain what I found How can I continue to debug... Thanksp

Negative 11459 pThe issue Im having is my code is creating duplicate data in the database. I believe the following is what is occurring even though it ought to be impossiblep  pWe have a page which has a long running task which is kicked off by an UpdatePanel in this case, triggered by a timer. This task grabs data from a web service, deletes the local copy actually just sets an IsDeleted flag, not a sql DELETE, and creates a new object and commits it to the DB.p  pI believe that core cause of the duplication is that the user is closingreloading the tab before the AJAX request returns and is starting the process anew. As the first AJAX request is still processing, the second one starts. The logs back this up.p  pHowever, I know this should be impossible The page in question reads and writes to Session, and EnableSessionState is not set to ReadOnly or Disabled. The requests should have been queued and not interleaved. However the logs clearly show the followingp  pThread 1 gets halfway done with processing deletes half the data and creates new objects then the web service starts to lag.p  pThread 2 kicks off, grabbing data which has been half updated by thread 1. This half updates fine because it is just like a regular data refresh thus far from Thread 2s perspective the same as if we had queued the requestsp  pThread 1 finishes, deleting the last half of the data, creating new objects.p  pThread 2 finishes, deleting the last half of the data the same as thread 1 has just done, but the ORM we are using wont complain and creates new objects which are duplicates of the objects thread 1 just created.p  pI know about half a dozen ways to fix the problem that isnt my question. My question is Is there anything special about long running minutes long processes in ASP.NET which would allow the processes to interleave How about AJAX requestsp  pThe only thing I can think of is that we do something in a DLL like the followingp  precodeDateTime now  DateTime.Now DateTime until  now.AddMinutes3 whileuntil gt now     var result  makeWebServiceRequest     ifresult.error  0          process data          Try again in 10 seconds     System.Thread.Threading.Sleep10000  codepre  pIs it possible that while a thread is sleeping, it doesnt count towards the session queue, especially since its in an external assemblyp

Negative 11459 pIve written a hrefhttpswww.primroseeditor.com relnofollowa text editor in JavaScript that draws directly to a Canvas elementa for various reasons, but my primary reason is so I can slap that canvas onto a WebGL mesh as a texture. As a happy surprise, its been easier to implement that any contenteditable solutions Ive found.p  pOne thing I noticed early on were complaints from people with keyboard layouts other than enUS QWERTY that some keys were showing an incorrect letter. After some fiddling around with Windows language settings and onscreen keyboard, I created a codepage based solution that maps keyCodes to characterstrings for different locales directly, rather than just assuming keyCode 51 with no modifier keys is the number 3. Because its not, on some keyboards its doubleqoute.p  pBut there are still some oddities. A few examples note that all of these examples are based on using the Windows onscreen keyboard, so Im only assuming this correlates with realityp  ul liThe strongFrench AZERTYstrong keyboard sends a keyDown and keyPressed events when a letter U is typed, but never a keyUp. Im assuming U must be need to be combined with another key, but not knowing what the correct behavior should be is preventing me from writing the right code. emEDIT I still havent quite figured out what this means, a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiAZERTYMissingelements relnofollowother thanperhapsthat key is only used in one word the entire French languageaemli listrikeThe strongGerman QWERTZstrong keyboard has a  its not a caret, it looks larger key where the  backtick key would be on the US keyboard, and a backtick key where the  equals key would be on the US keyboard. In both cases, they send keyDown and keyUp events, but do not appear to print anything in any text editor I use, until they are hit a second time, and then two characters are printed. Is this something to do with combining marks I cant find anything about it.strike emEDIT a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDeadkey relnofollowThese are called dead keysa, and they create accented letters. A lot of keyboard layouts have them. Ill create a keysequencing system for this that will also help provide support for more complex, Emacsstyle keyboard shortcuts, if any are chosen.emli listrikeThe strongUK QWERTYstrong keyboard has a backslash that requires use of an ALTGRAPH key RightAlt key on US keyboards. There is a stronga hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebAPIKeyboardEvent.location relnofollowlocation property of KeyboardEventastrong that could be used to determine which of the ALT keys are pressed, but it apparently isnt available in Safari. This is pretty low priority, as Safari typically only accounts for 1 or less of my traffic. However, is there a property that works for Safari that I can use as a fallbackstrike emEDIT Ill handle this as the rest of my codepage system works for the differences between lower and uppercase keys. Its just a different code page for a new modifier key. Ill have to change how the modifier keys are detected, but its a minor change and will actually fit into the keyboard shortcut system quite easily.emli liFinally, judging from the Windows language settings, there are a lot of different keyboard layouts in the world. Is there any listing of the keycodes and behaviors anywhere Id rather not have to manually test every keyboard just to generate a new codepage for them.li ul  pThe first two problems are the biggest. I can figure out a solution to these if I just know what the behavior is supposed to be. The third issue will fit into my codepage system, though Ill have to change how I read modifier keys. The final issue, I could probably pay someone to cover.p  pAnd Im fine with not being able to solve it for all users in all browsers 100 of the time. But most of the information Ive ran across is basically dont bother, which really only sounds more like I dont know.p  pemEDIT selecting the layout isnt a concern. I provide it as an option to the user, if things arent working for them. I think thats about the best thing one can do in this situation, but obviously I would autodetect if I could. Im really only concerned with getting the right behavior given that the right layout has already been chosen.emp  pemI would like to avoid anything involving the keyPress event, given that it isnt perfectly reliable. If I had a reliable source of data on keyboard layouts, it wouldnt be an issue.emp

Negative 11459 pIf I have a serverstrongs1strong proxying requests to 2 different websocket serversstrongs2strong amp strongs3strong and want this entire process to use ssl, conceptually what has to happen for this to be successful p  pemI realize my proxy is more of a load balancer and I understand that handshake process takes 2 requests in order to upgrade the connection and that these requests must go to the same backend websocket server for the connection upgrade to be successful.emp  pFirst of all everything below is somewhat contingent upon my notion of what a websocket connection isp  ul liMy idea of a websocket connection is something like a private tunnel from the client to the server that is used to exchange data between the two. This tunnel exists for the duration of the connection. Is this accurateli ul  pIn my example at the top, the client would try to establish a connection to strongs1strong but strongs1strong would proxy this request to either strongs2strong or strongs3strong. Assuming my tunnel notion is correct, these are the 3 cases I imagine to be possible but I dont know which one actually happensp  ol liThe tunnel just passes through strongs1strong to strongs2strongstrongs3strong unbroken.li liTwo separate tunnels get created, one tunnel from client to strongs1strong     and another from strongs1strong to either strongs2strong or strongs3strong.li listrongs1strong is bypassed completely and a direct tunnel from client to strongs2strong or strongs3strong is created.li ol  pWhich of the 3 scenarios outlined above is most correct Or are they all so wrong that another description of what is happening necessaryp  pWhich IP would the ssl certificate need to be assigned to in the situation outlined at the top, the proxy or the websocket servers Or would I need a separate certificate for each IP in this processp  pIm using node.js with express and socket.io  1.0. p  pAnything that can help me understand this process better is appreciated. I thank you for your time in advance.p
Negative 11459 pIm trying to recreate a list definition in SharePoint 2013 using VS 2013 that was originally created in SharePoint 2010 and VS 2010.  The list is large and has 216 columns. Im aware of the SharePoint limits for the number of number columns 72 and other limits listed in this a hrefhttptechnet.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc26278728voffice.1529.aspx relnofollowTechNet articlea p  pThe problem Im having is that as soon as I try to add my 86th column to the list definition, Im no longer able to deploy my solution. It doesnt matter what type of column I try to add.p  pWhen I take a look at the ULS logs I find the following errorp  precodeSystem.Data.SqlClient.SqlException 0x80131904 Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint AllUserDataPK. Cannot insert duplicate key in object dbo.AllUserData. The duplicate key value is 71680b6caf2d468db29163721ac92441, 4ce9b10e87b64e2ebf0dc0c5be539929, 0x, 1, 181, 0, 1, 0.  The statement has been terminated. codepre  pI also tried to add the FieldRef and Field manually within the schema.xml file instead of using the wizard but I get the same error. If I dont add the additional column, the list definition deploys just fine.  Whats strange is that Im able to add the column to the list within SharePoint.  p  pIm not sure what to try next.p  pstrongUpdatestrong After working on this problem for quite a while, this is what Ive tried and what Ive found. I created a new web application and a new site collection to make sure there wasnt a previous deployment that could have conflicted with the changes I was making and I still got the same error.  p  pI then created a list definition with the same column name but with a number extension Test001 through Test200.  This worked fine.p  pI then went column by column changing each name and display name.  One of the columns was named Category in the 2010 version and this is already in use in 2013 so I changed it to a different value.  Everything was fine until I started to add the column named Qty01.  At this point it failed.  I tried changing the column name to Quantity01 and the deployment was fine.  Qty02 also failed as well as Qty03 and Qty001.  So what Ive found is you cant use Qty with a number as a column name which I think is rather bizarre.p  pHas anyone else ever experience an issue like this  Ive taken a look at all the reserved column names for SharePoint but Qty doesnt show up anywhere.  I also looked at SQL Server reserved names and didnt find anything there either.p
Negative 11459 pI have written the following code to calculate the slope of a 2d line.

Negative 11459 pI currently have a JAXWS webservice that I am deploying in WASCE Websphere community eddition. A typical request sent to this web service takes around 15  20 minutes to complete. Calls to the webservice work fine most of the times but every now and then, the web service takes an hour to respond back to the client. p  pWhen I try to access the WASCE admin console through the browser when the web service stops responding, the browser keeps infinitely waiting for the admin console to open. Also, when I try to access the wsdl of the webservice in the browser, the browser keeps infinitely waiting for the wsdl response from the webservice. Also, there are no application logs printed once the web sphere stops responding.p  pWithout going in to the details of my WS implementation, what could be some of the most obvious reasons for a JAXWS webservice to suddently stop doing any work on the server and not send a response back to the client Let me know if any additional information is required to answer this question in the comments.p

Negative 11459 pIm developing a custom table component for very large and very custom content. Therefore I decided not to go with codeTableViewcode, but start from scratch i.e. codeControlcode. I adopted the idea of the codeVirtualFlowcode to create and manage only the visible part of the table and reuse cells that have become invisible. However I needed virtual rows and columns. p  pMy CustomVirtualFlow implements codelayoutChildrencode. From the components size and scrollbar positions I know which cells are visible. If necessary, I add cells to the VirtualFlow. I then update the content and css pseudo class states selected, focused, ....p  pThis works almost fine ... currently, my only problem is that the css styles are sometimes lagging newly created cells are shown with e.g. wrong backgrounds for a moment and then get correcteted with the next pulse.p  pMy explanation for this is that JavaFX performs layout in two passes  first a css pass and secondly the layout pass that calls layoutChildren. The css of newly added children during layoutChildren is therefore not processes correctly.p  pI tried to call applyCss directly, which helps, but seems to do too much because it takes a lot of time.p  pMy question is  How is the correct way to add nodes during layout, i.e. if the size of the component makes it neccessary to use further nodes If it is not during layoutChildren, where else should I do itp

Negative 11459 pI have a question re git workflow with 2 developers. Ive read quite a bit but Im still missing something.p  pSo I work with another developer on a project. We each have local dev environments vagrant and there is a stage server where we are both pushing our commits to. Right now we both have separate repos on the stage server, so he has his that he pullspushes against, and I have mine that I pullpush against.p  pAfter he makes changes, I have him push to stage, then I log into the stage server, go to his repo and run a fetchmerge so that he gets any changes Ive made, then I push his merged commit to my repo so that I have his changes.p  pI started by using bare repos on the stage server, but it would not let me fetchmerge with bare repo. So I switched to nonbare repo, and now I get an error that I cant push from the dev environment to the stage repo because the master branch is checked out which isnt a problem with the bare repo. I solved this using the receive.denyCurrentBranch ignore option on the stage repos, but I feel like maybe Im just doing something wrong.p  pCan anyone tell me where I am going wrong with this setup p

Negative 11459 pThe system supplied text menu works by sending a number of messages like changeFont modifyFont and addFontTrait up the first responder chain until it reaches an NSTextView for example.p  pId like to extend this to control row styles in my NSOutlineView but I have only been able to override changeFont in my window controller and intercept the message maybe a better place to do this but it works for now. This works for changing fonts but the other menu items like Bold, Bigger, Smaller which use modifyFont and addFontTrait arent ever getting called in the window controller so I cant modify their behavior to work on the outline view. Interestingly they appear selectable in the menu but only changeFont is called and as I understand it I need to get a tag value from the NSMenuItem which is the sender of the methods modifyFont and addFontTrait.p  pDoes anyone know how to implement this functionality by getting those other methods to be called anywhere Thanksp

Negative 11459 pLets say I have an item codeA,B,Ccode in codeTable1code.  They all have attributes codef1code.

Things working fine for codeAcode and codeBcode. But in the case of codeCcode, when i loop through codeTable2code, since there is no record of codeCcode in codeTable2code, I cannot distinguish if its a corrupted table or the fact that codeCcode just does not have attribute codef2code.p  pThe only twos ways i can think of to solve this issue is 1. Adding a constraint in the code, likep  precode   if iteaName  C         Do not search Table2    else search Table2        if No record           return Corrupted Table  codepre  pOr  2. Adding another bool field codehavingf2codein codeTalbe1code to helping identifying that codef2code does not apply to C.p  pThe above is just an example of where to put such business logic constraints, in the DB or in the code. p  pCan you give me more opinions on the tradeoff between the above two ideology In another word, which one makes more sence.p
Negative 11459 pIm trying to write a simple test case to pull messages from a queue based on a message property, hitting a 7.5.0.3 QMgr and using the 7.5.0.3 client jars.p  pEverything I have seen online says that I need to specify the message selector when I open the queue.

Negative 11459 pWe have an VB6 application that used MsAccess 97 database files in conjunction with a workgroup file. To keep users from accidentically opening the files directly, we have changed the extension of the files from codemdbcode and codemdwcode to codesdbcode and codesdwcode, respectively. The next Version of our application is to run with MsAccess 2013 databasees. We also have done the extension mangling with the new codeaccdbcode files, they now have the extension codesccdbcode.

Negative 11459 pI would like to create a report that is expanded by default when first run.

All the groups would be of a tablix and created in a stepped style report as I want to create a drill down report with the toggle.p  pThe problem is  I have 3 parameters  Summary,Intermediate,Detailed. When the user selects the Summary parameter, only the Country field is displayed with the toggle which when clicked, expands the State column and the toggle in the State column when clicked expands the City column, and can be collapsed also by clicking on the toggle.p  pWhen the user selects the Intermediate parameter, only the Country column and the expanded State column should be displayed when the report is initially run, and the toggle on the State column should take me to the City column and can be collapsed also by clicking on the toggle.p  pSimilarly, when the user selects the Detailed parameter, all of the three columns should be displayed in the expanded state when the report is initially run and can be collapsed also by clicking on the toggle.p  pHow can I achieve this I have tried a number of ways but no luck.p  pPlease help me..p  pThanksp

The LoginSignup flow works fine. p  pThe two tabs are  1. a UICollectionView which I will refer to as IntroVC from now on 2. a UITableView which I will refer to as FeedVCp  pWhen a user clicks a photo in IntroVC, a Show segue is triggered via prepareForSegue that shows a 3rd screen UIView which is technically not a tab. I will refer to this as the SelectVC from now on. p  pNOTE All of these screens are also Embedded In a Navigation Controller. p  pThe SelectVC displays a photo, and there is a UIButton that the user can press which triggers a Show segue and Unwind segue, to push the image into the FeedVC. The reason I created an Unwind segue is because without it, the image would push into the FeedVC 2nd tab but the first tab would still be highlighted. p  pI fixed this with the Unwind segue, but I noticed Im having a problem where after a selection, when I press the 1st tab Intro VC the Nav bar has a Back button, and the more times I use the SelectVC button to push images, the more times I have to press Back in the IntroVC.

Negative 11459 pwe are using Cassandra 2.0.14 on a system with 64GB RAM, 8GB HEAP size, 32core CPU, Java 1.7.

Negative 11459 pI wanted to have a navbar on the left which is fixed when scrolling, but is flexible with the size of the screen.

However, since I included affix I have an annoying effect when I load the site. First the text on the site appears low about 300px below where it is supposed to be... and than it goes to the place where I want it. I think the reason is that it takes time to load the affix.js file and only after loading it does it put the text at the right place. My question therefore is how can I avoid thisp  pMaybe affix is a bit too much, since it is actually used to have a navbar which is dynamic. I dont really want that. I guess I could try to get the navbar without a javascript, but that seemed a bit tricky. My navbar is flexible with screen size, and I cant figure out how to make it additionally to that fixed against scrolling.p  phi again it took me a while to figure out how jsfiddle works, but here is the linkp  pa hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netcarl101rb8x80yb2embeddedresult relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.netcarl101rb8x80yb2embeddedresultap  pit shows the navbar on the left and the navbar on the top.

Negative 11459 pIm using Laravel 5.1 for my backend and at the same time, I have Nodejs server running purely for socket.io and this is only for the news table.p  pBasically, every single time an item is added to the news table in mySQL, Laravel broadcasts an event, which is caught by socket.io on the client and then socket.io sends off an AJAX call to the server API to retrieve the news item. p  pI am very new to Node.js and this is my first project actually using it. I was thinking about using pusher instead, for Realtime updates, but wanted to try something new and went for this setup.p  pSo my question is, how secure is Node.js server in this scenario It runs a very simple server at the moment as I said, which is solely for socket.io and nothing else. Are there any security measures I should take before the app goes LIVEp
Negative 11459 pFirst post on stackoverflow. I have found this website extremely useful throughout my past 5 years of studying digital technology at high school. This time everything I find on here wont work, I suspect its very obvious, just looking for someone to point out my novice mistake.p  pI have created a website that features large images and lots of JQuery animations, this is a large bulk of my website. When viewed on a 1080p screen it looks as I intended but when i viewed it on a friends smaller resolution screen I realized that I needed to make everything scale. I recoded everything to percentages and used Maxheight, maxwidth on my images to make them scale but my title and link are contained within a div and eve though I have tried maxwidth,maxheight on the images with a set width height on the div it still doesnt seem to work. p  pTLDR I want my title and links to scale as the browser window is resized, as I have already working with the Pukeko and Hills. Any other problems in my code would also be greatly appreciated.p  pWebsite a hrefhttppirithepukeko.tumblr.com relnofollowhttppirithepukeko.tumblr.comap  pHere is my codep  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt     ltstyle typetextcssgt      html      overflow hidden           iframetumblrcontrols       top 0 important      right0 important       displaynone important            ltstylegt     ltscript src     httpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery2.1.4jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscriptgt     window.loadfunction      Hill.animate top 100, 3000      Pukeko.delay1000.animate left 100, 2000      P.delay2000.fadeIn3000     I.delay2000.fadeIn3000     R.delay2000.fadeIn3000     I2.delay2000.fadeIn3000      T.delay2000.fadeIn3000     H.delay2000.fadeIn3000     E.delay2000.fadeIn3000      P2.delay2000.fadeIn3000     U.delay2000.fadeIn3000     K.delay2000.fadeIn3000     E2.delay2000.fadeIn3000     K2.delay2000.fadeIn3000     0.delay2000.fadeIn3000     BuyButton.delay4000.fadeIn4000     ExampleButton.delay4000.fadeIn4000           ltscriptgt     lttitlegtlttitlegt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltimg idbg srchttpi.imgur.comwpAxcsD.png style     positionfixed top 0 left 0 minwidth100 minheight 100gt     ltdiv idheader style     positionabsolute zindex 2 Left12 Top20 maxwidth50 maxHeight20gt     ltimg idP srchttpi.imgur.comVAjsWaY.png style     zindex 2 displaynone maxwidth 100 maxheight 100gt         ltimg idI srchttpi.imgur.comtx3QKsv.png style         zindex 2 displaynone maxwidth 100 maxheight 100gt         ltimg idR srchttpi.imgur.com2z85VMR.png style         zindex 2 displaynone maxwidth 100 maxheight 100gt         ltimg idI2 srchttpi.imgur.comtx3QKsv.png style         zindex 2 displaynone maxwidth 100 maxheight 100gt         ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbsp ltimg idT src         httpi.imgur.comMQOOrTY.png style         zindex 2 displaynone maxwidth 100 maxheight 100gt         ltimg idH srchttpi.imgur.comA7RunYJ.png style         zindex 2 displaynone maxwidth 100 maxheight 100gt         ltimg idE srchttpi.imgur.com2M9Fyg9.png style         zindex 2 displaynone maxwidth 100 maxheight 100gt         ltpgt             ltimg idP2 srchttpi.imgur.comVAjsWaY.png style             zindex 2 displaynonemaxwidth 100 maxheight 100gt             ltimg idU srchttpi.imgur.com7ukLJsL.png style             zindex 2 displaynone maxwidth 100 maxheight 100gt             ltimg idK srchttpi.imgur.comagxDLLs.png style             zindex 2 displaynone maxwidth 100 maxheight 100gt             ltimg idE2 srchttpi.imgur.com2M9Fyg9.png style             zindex 2 displaynone maxwidth 100 maxheight 100gt             ltimg idK2 srchttpi.imgur.comagxDLLs.png style             zindex 2 displaynone maxwidth 100 maxheight 100gtltimggt             ltimg id0 srchttpi.imgur.comWRT7FYQ.png style             zindex 2 displaynone maxwidth 100 maxheight 100gt         ltpgt         ltpgtltpgt         ltpgtltpgt         ltpgt             lta hrefhttpwww.pirithepukeko.tumblr.comBuygtltimg id             BuyButton srchttpi.imgur.comQ4eqkdm.png style             displaynone zindex 2 maxwidth 100 maxheight 100 minwidth 5 minheight 5gtltagt         ltpgt         ltpgtltpgt         ltpgt             lta hrefhttpwww.pirithepukeko.tumblr.comexamplegtltimg id             ExampleButton srchttpi.imgur.comCpinwiT.png style             displaynone zindex 2 maxwidth 100 maxheight 100 minwidth 5 minheight 5gtltagt         ltpgtltbrgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv idstuff style zindex 1 Left0 Top0gt         ltimg idHill srchttpi.imgur.comr3gkAkv.png style         positionfixed Left0 TOP100 zindex 1 maxwidth 100 maxheight 110 minwidth 50 minheight 50gt         ltimg idPukeko srchttpi.imgur.comcO8u6M6.png style         positionfixed TOP0 LEFT100 maxwidth100 maxheight110 zindex 1gt     ltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  pp

Negative 11459 pI made a script for reading 15 data files, computing a difference between each 2 files and writing the results to 5 different files. These 5 files are matrixes, 10x259 values.

Negative 11459 pso the problem is I have a mailto html tag and when used via IE8 our clients use it..., before popping up outlook, it shows a warning This form is being submitted using email. Submitting this form will reveal your email address to the recipient, and will send the form data without encrypting it for privacy. You may continue or cancel this submission. The problem is that many of the users do not speak english, so our client wants us to either remove this message we explained them it is a browser constraint, but they still insist on doing it or translating it to bulgarian. Any ideas which of these is easier to do  I mean possible at all. Is there a way to turn this message off from the browserp

Negative 11459 pI am working on an MVC web application which has to access files in various shared directories. Currently I am using this a hrefhttpsgithub.commj1856SimpleImpersonation relnofollowimplementation of impersonationa to access a directory, which works fine. My problem starts when I have to open multiple files from the same directory, since right now I initialize a new impersonator every time and I quickly reach the number of allowed connections to the target computer. p  pThe code right now looks likep  precode do stuff that does not require impersonation  using Impersonation.LogonUserdomain, username, password, LogonType.NewCredentials       access one particular file    continue doing stuff that does not require impersonation codepre  pHowever, if I use just one impersonation instance, I can access as many files as I want. This is though impractical for a web application, as I would have to run all my code under impersonation.

Basically something like the following pseudocodep  precode do stuff that does not require impersonation   get cached impersonation or create a new one var imp  GetImpersonationFromStaticSharedCachedomain, username, password  access one particular file   stop impersonation, but dont dispose it, so that I can reuse it later imp.StopImpersonationForTheCurrentThread    continue doing stuff that does not require impersonation codepre

Negative 11459 pI am new to both Wix and WixSharp. I recently learnt Wix and created a basic installer with it. One of the properties I used was IniFileSearch which helped me search a value from an IniFile and use that to find an install location for my files. I am trying to do the same using WixSharp but dont seem to find an equivalent method. The closest thing I could find in WixSharp is the AppSearch class under WixSharp.CommonTasks.  From Wix I know that AppSearch is a MSI database table where search tasks are stored. IniFileSearch is one of those searches. I am not even sure if the AppSearch class in WixSharp library is directly mapped to the AppSearch MSI database table.  Anyways, my goal is to find the IniFileSearch equivalent method in WixSharp Library. If anybody knows it, an example would be great.p  pHere is a sample IniFileSearch in Wix markupp  precodeltProperty IdMYPROPERTYgt  ltIniFileSearch IdmyIniSearch                 NamemyConfigFile.ini                 Sectionsection1                 Keyname                 Typeraw gt ltPropertygt codepre

Could you please elaborate because Ive been searching for weeks before I posted. There is very little on how to create a full width tablet website. If you want examples I can create some pages. The problem is so many different resolutions. An example, I want to have a page or form with accountcontact details and have it fit any size tablet, on a desktop if I open the page on a 50 inch screen it wont work if the inputs are widthpercent. Why it is limited to maxwidth998px, to try fit most desktops. But tablets, despite the resolution, are small screens, and will look perfect full width.p
