Positive 816 pI guess the only way to search for partial words and phrases in Lucene is by using ngramtokenizer. If there are any other ways then please suggest. I am a C programmer and I am new to lucene and java programming. I am using Eclipse IDE and Lucene 5.3.0. I managed to create lucene index of a text file and search in it with standardanalyzer and englishanalyzer, but I am running into errors when indexing ngram tokens. I followed a few examples online and none of them work. I need a simple straightforward example of how to create index and search in it for partial words and phrases using ngrams in lucene 5.3.0. I hope, the experts here can help me out with this.p  pThanks in advance. p

Negative 816 pI am new to using Unity and IoCDI concepts.

Negative 816 pI am currently working on a very large legacy MFC MDI application.  It has a large number of UI elements  dockable toolbars, custom tree controls, context menus, etc.  It is an image processing application so the main views render themselves using DirectX and OpenGL.  The product is about 10 years old and one of the priorities here is to update the look and feel of it.p  pKnowing that Microsoft has done a good job of providing interoperability between CMFC and .NET I thought it would make sense to migrate the code base incrementally.  What Im struggling with now is where to start.  p  pOne approach is to rip out the MFC framework with WPF and reuse as much of the C code as we can.  This will let us maximize the benefits of the WPF architecture but will mean a long development period until were fully functional again.p  pAnother approach is to replace MFC controls one at a time with their WPF counterparts.  This will allow us to work incrementally.  My concern with this approach is that it means there will be an awful lot of connection points between managed and unmanaged code and Im not sure where to start with replacing things like the main menu and toolbars.p  pOr is there another option here Im not seeingp  pAny suggestions or links to information on this topic would be appreciated.  p  pstrongUpdatestrong  DavidK raised some excellent questions so Im adding the motivations behind this.p  pem1 Future development of the productem  p  pThis product is still being actively developed with new features getting added on a regular basis.

MFC applications are limited to a single top level frame, making it very difficult to leverage multiple monitors.p  pem2 Employee retention and recruitmentemp  pIts getting harder and harder to find developers who are willing to work on MFC.

However, this extension would happen independent of the library Im currently writing.p  pKagents.dll       Handles StateDefinition parsing and such.p  pSomething Referencing Kagents.dll       Has a protobuff file with extend GraphicsStateDef to define the state needed.p  pI was hoping that defining the extend GraphicsStateDef would generate code that would allow me to use properties to access these fields, and avoid the cumbersome Extendible.AppendValue and GetValue syntax.p  pOne solution I devised, which seems hackish, is to define a class in the referencing DLL with extension methods, like sop  pre     public static class GraphicsExt              enum Fields                      someValue  1,             someOtherValue  2                   public static Int32 someValuethis State.GraphicsStateDef def                      return Extensible.GetValuedef, Fields.someValue                  public static void someValuethis State.graphicsStateDef def, Int32 value                      Extensible.AppendValuedef, fields.someValue, value               pre  pIf anyone can think of a better way, I would be much obliged.  Also, Im not sure how lucid my description of the problem came out, so if theres any clarification or further information I can provide, please let me know. p  pEDIT So, After thinking a lot about this and realized Im approaching the problem wrong. StateReference is supposed to store a list of different GameStates.  As well, it stores a StateDefinition, which should describe the state of this state reference.  Currently, Im trying to deserialize the state buffers into different classes GraphicsStateDef, when I really should be deserializing into the state objects themselves.p  pTherefore, I need to rethink the design such that StateDefinition becomes a container for the stream and extracts only enough information for the repeated StateTypes requiredStates1 field.  Then, in the referencing assembly, the rest of the stream can be deserialized into the respective states.p  pDoes anyone have reccomendations for how to approach this A few ideas are formulating, but nothing concrete, and Id love the input of others.p

Negative 816 pWe have an HTTPModule whose sole purpose is to do url rewriting. By definition of an HTTPModule, ALL browser requests html, css, javascript, images, etc go through the event handlers of this class.p  pDuring the signin process, we are catching the moment when the user switches from anonymous to signedin user in the Global.asaxs ProfileOnMigrateAnonymous event handler. One issue were finding is that when the user signs in, the ProfileOnMigrateAnonymous event fires, seemingly, for possibly EVERY resource within the request to generate the page to the user  namely, the html, css, javascript, images, etc. It was my understanding that this event will fire only ONCE. Why would it be firing multiple times Is it a result of our registered url rewriting HTTPModule Is there a way we can configure the application to only fire that event oncep
Negative 816 pIve spent a lot of time building out tests for my latest project, and Im really not sure what the ROI was on the time spent.  p  pIm a one man operation, and Im building web applications.  I dont necessarily have to prove that my software works to anyone except my users, and Im worried that I spent a good deal of time needlessly rebugging test code in the past months.p  pMy question is, while I like the idea of TDD for small to large software teams, how does it help a one man team build high quality code quicklyp  pThanksp  p  ran across this today, from the blog of joel spolsky, one of the founders of stackoverflowp  pa hrefhttpwww.joelonsoftware.comitems20090923.html relnofollowhttpwww.joelonsoftware.comitems20090923.htmlap  pZawinski didnt do many unit tests. They sound great in principle. Given a leisurely development pace, thats certainly the way to go. But when youre looking at, Weve got to go from zero to done in six weeks, well, I cant do that unless I cut something out. And what Im going to cut out is the stuff thats not absolutely critical. And unit tests are not critical. If theres no unit test the customer isnt going to complain about that.p  pas im getting older i think im realizing more and more that its just all about speed and functionality.  id love to build unit tests.  but since we only have so much time at our disposal, id rather build it faster, and rely on beta testing and good automated error reporting to weed out any problems as they crop up.  if the project eventually gets big enough that this bites me in the a, it will be generating enough revenue that i can justify a rebuild.p

I am assuming the Django rendering is safe I asked a question about this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2319306isitsafetorenderusercreateddjangotemplatesbeforea, but there is still the risk of crosssitescripting, and Id like to prevent this. One of the main requirements of these templates is that the user should have some control over the layout of the page, not just its semantics. I see a couple of solutionsp  ul liAllow the user to use HTML, but filter out dangerous tags manually in the final step things like codeltscriptgtcode and codelta onclick..gtcode.

The pro here is that some markup languages are welldocumented, and users might already know how to use them.li liCome up with some proprietary markup.

Negative 816 pIn my current project we have a couple of data classes that deal with core concepts of our application domain. Now at some places in our project we have to have different behavior depending on the concrete object in hand. E.g. a JList has the task to render a list of  objects but we want the rendering to be slightly different, depending on the objects class. E.g. an object of class A should be rendered different than one of class B and class C is a totally different animal, too.p  pWe encapsulate the behavior in strategy classes and then have a factory that returns a class suitable for the object that is to be rendered. From the client perspective, that is okay, I guess.p  pNow from the perspective of the factory this gets pretty ugly, because all we could come up with so far is stuff likep  precodeif obj instanceof classA return strategyA else if obj instanceof classB return strategyB ... codepre  pNow, for a pool of already instantiated objects, a map would also work. But if the factory has to actually create a new object, wed have to put another layer of factorystrategy objects into that map that then return a suitable strategies for displaying. p  pIs there any design pattern that deals nicely with this kind of problemp

Negative 816 pI have a project in two parts a Silverlight front end and a WCF duplex service.

Negative 816 pI used to work in JavaScript a lot and one thing that really bothered my employers was that the source code was too easy to steal.

The closest I can see is something about the linker, but I dont understand that  so if someone could explain in more detail that would be great.p  pIn my case, I have 2 projects in Visual C  the production dsw, and the test code dsw. I have loaded and rebuilt both dsws in debug mode. I want a breakpoint in the production code, which is run via the test scripts. My issue is I get the error message when I run the test code, because the break point is in the production code, which isnt loaded up when the test starts.p  pNear the beginning of the test script there is a mytestinitialize command. I imagine this goes off and loads up the production dll. Once this line has executed, I can put the breakpoint in my production code and run until I hit it. But its quite annoying to have to run to this line, set the breakpoint and continue every time I want to run the test.p  pSo I think the problem is Visual C doesnt realise the two projects are related.

Negative 816 pI have a web application where the web server and SQL Server 2008 database sit on different boxes in the same server farm. p  pstrongIf I take a monolithic stored procedure and break it up into several smaller stored procs, thus making the client code responsible for calls to multiple stored procedures instead of just one, and I going to notice a significant performance hit in my web applicationstrongp  hr  pAdditional Background Infop  pI have a stored procedure with several hundred lines of code containing decision logic, update statements, and finally a select statement that returns a set of data to the client.p  pI need to insert a piece of functionality into my client code in this sense, the client code is the ASP web server that is calling the database server that calls a component DLL.  However, the stored procedure is updating a recordset and returning the udpated data in the same call, and my code ideally needs to be called emafterem the decision logic and update statements are called, but embeforeem the data is returned to the client.p  pTo get this functionality to work, Im probably going to have to split the existing stored proc into at least two parts one stored proc that updates the database and another that retrieves data from the database.  I would then insert my new code between these stored proc calls.p  pWhen I look at this problem, I cant help but think that, from a code maintenance point of view, it would be much better to isolate emallem of my update and select statements into thin stored procs and leave the business logic to the client code.  That way whenever I need to insert functionality or decision logic into my client code, all I need to do is change the client code instead of modifying a huge stored proc.p  pAlthough using thin stored procs might be better from a code maintenance pointofview, how much performance pain will I experience by increasing the number of trips to the database  The net result to the data is the same, but Im touching the database more frequently.  How does this approach affect performance when the application is scaled up to handle demandp  pIm not one to place performance optimization above everything else, especially when it affects code maintenance, but I dont want to shoot myself in the foot and create headaches when the web application has to scale.p

Negative 816 pIs there a general practice when it comes to how to organize your classes in C  Should there only be one generic class per .cs file  I see that I have Form1.cs which includes all of the classes relevant to Form1.

Not sure which way to go so everything stays organized.p  pOr should I organize them a specific way  For example, I am accessing a MySQL database, so im creating a MySQL wrapper which I will store in MysqlWrapper.cs and name the class to match it.

Negative 816 pAs some of you may have seen me experimenting with a program converting from Fahrenheit to Celsius and visa versa in ObjectiveC based off of console input and output.  Im just doing this to better learn the language and I think its a good way to demonstrate some of the things Ive been exposed to.p  pSo, anyway, I am looking to incorporate both the Kelvin and Rankine scales into my program, a good suggestion Id like to take up on proposed by dreamlax.p  pNow, up until this point, my program has functioned relatively well for converting between Fahrenheit and Celsius, but if I need to convert between these 4 different scales, Im going to have to work at it a different way in my opinion.p  pFirst off, I need to provide the enduser with the choice of their starting temperature, the temperature they want to convert from.p  pIn order to do this, I need to prompt them with an NSLog or printf statement instructing them to do this.p  pNow, I would rather have them type out Fahrenheit, Celsius, Kelvin or Rankine, based upon which ever one they would like, rather than 03.  Now, I dont think the scanf is capable, but if Im wrong, Id like to know if it either has this functionality, or this is another method I can take advantage of to add this to my program.p  pNext, Im kind of lost.  I obviously would need to instruct them to pick their target temperature, in other words, the temperature they want to convert to.p  pI need some help on a recommendation on how to organize this in my program.. Should I use only 1 class  Also, I guess I could set it up this wayp  precodestring baseTemp string targetTemp  NSLogPlease type Fahrenheit, Celsius, Kelvin or Rankine to select your base temperature scanf or some other method herestring format specifier here ampbaseTemp NSLogPlease type Fahrenheit, Celsius, Kelvin or Rankine to select your target temperature scanf or some other method herestring format specifier here amptargetTemp codepre  pNow, I need a decision maker to decide if Fahrenheit  baseTemp and Celsius  targetTemp, then set up a certain formula accordingly.p  pThis could get tedious, and I first off need that special decision maker, or just another simpler method.p  pSorry for the probably quite awkward code, Im trying to use what Ive learned thus far here.p  pAny suggestions, tweaks, ideas and anything in between is greatly appreciatedp  pThanksp  pstrongUPDATE UPDATE UPDATEstrongp  pThe code for the class.h, class.m and main.m program files contain the final code, at least for this project, which dreamlax worked with me greatly to help us both achieve the goal I had.

I have the 212 and 100 values solved easily, because 100 has been there in the first place, and 212 can easily be remedied by replacing it with the string formatter of the sourceTemp variable.p  pNow, the Fahrenheit string is a bit different.p  pI have tried to establish something new in our original switch like sop  precodeswitch prompt       case 1         enduser chooses Fahrenheit         [converter setFahrenheitValuesourceTemp]         sourceTempText  1         break      case 2         enduser chooses Celsius         [converter setCelsiusValuesourceTemp]         sourceTempText  2         break      case 3         enduser chooses Kelvin         [converter setKelvinValuesourceTemp]         sourceTempText  3         break      case 4         enduser chooses Rankine         [converter setRankineValuesourceTemp]         sourceTempText  4         break  codepre  pOK, so I have added to each different case, setting a new variable named sourceTempText to either 14, the same value that the enduser chose to pick hisher source temperature.p  pNow, here is how I tried to display the final prompt to the enduser with the final switchp  precodeswitch prompt2       case 1         enduser chooses Fahrenheit         printflf degrees sourceTempText is lf degrees Fahrenheitn, sourceTemp, [converter fahrenheitValue]         break      case 2         enduser chooses Celsius         printflf degrees sourceTempText is lf degrees Celsiusn, sourceTemp, [converter celsiusValue]         break      case 3         enduser chooses Kelvin         printflf degrees sourceTempText is lf degrees Kelvinn, sourceTemp, [converter kelvinValue]         break      case 4         enduser chooses Rankine         printflf degrees sourceTempText is lf degrees Rankinen, sourceTemp, [converter rankineValue]         break  codepre  pI am not sure now, if I can insert sourceTempText into the string like I have here, instead, maybe I have to use a string formatter, but Im not sure.

JCIFS seems to be doing its job as well as I can see the NTLM challenge response taking place via Wireshark. The issue is that the message body is missing. It is simply null. Due to this the web service encounters a 501 and the codeInputStreamcode returned is null. p  pAnyone have a clue why this would happen p  pemNote Im removing the CONTENTLENGTH header below because codesetEntitycode apparently tries to set this but KSOAP has already set it. I simply remove it and allow codesetEntitycode to reset it.emp

Negative 816 pIve been trying for the past week to find a decent resource on floating point arithmetic for x86 assembly using ATampT syntax. Ideally, a list of the opcodes, what they do, and where the floats are stored. I am familiar with IEEE 754 representation. I am not familiar with the floating point stack, and any assembly referring to floating point arithmetic.p  pIts strange how difficult this is to find.p  pEDIT Ive been looking at gcc S output for the past month learning the assembly.

The one strongwithoutstrong numpy takes similar time as John found in his runs. One with numpy takes much longer. What is not clear to me is that the codepopncode instance is created before time recording begins at least that is what it appears from the code. Then, why is numpy version taking longer.

Negative 816 pIm trying ap  precodegit rebase onto master myremotemaster21 myremotemaster codepre  pto add the latest 21 commits from a remote repository on mine.p  pWhat git tells me is that theres a conflict  but hows that possiblep  pIn my understanding its just taking that 21 commits and applying them on top of my master. How can there be conflictsp  pThanks for helpp  pIm doing that btw because somehow I messed up my gitsvn repository the remote, and theres 21 commits which I dont manage to commit to subversion. So Im trying with a fresh gitsvn clone, in which Im adding those 21 commits.p
Negative 816 pTypical way to reference android control is something like thisp  precodeTextView tv  TextViewfindViewByIdR.id.tv codepre  pWhere R.id.tv is integer referencing my xml control.p  pThe thing is I would like to make reference using string R.id.tv. Is that possiblep  pLets say I have multiple controls p  precodetv1, tv2, tv3, tv4, tv5, codepre  pHow would I put this into some sort of loop and interate through controls. I am thinking I would use loop counter to reference different controls. Hows that to be done Thanks.p
Negative 816 pI just googled on how to use Application Settings and came up with the following a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comlibrary25zf0ze828vVS.10029.aspx relnofollowmsdn articlea. It describes to ways to add Application Settings at design time in VS 2010. One using the ProjectProperties and a second using the ProperiesWindow for a selected codecontrolcode. I tried the second one, but there simply is no node codeDatacode or a property codeApplicationSettingscode under it. Is the article outdated although it states there that it applies to VS2010 Or have I overlooked something else I vaguely remember seeing some such property in an older VS version but I am not sure about that.p  pEdit My project is a WPF project.p

Negative 816 pSo Im working on some pixel shaders for good old emulators like Super Nintendo. You have the classic algorithms like HQnx, 2xSaI, etc, and they are definitely written to run on CPUs and be scaled exactly to twice the size before blitting to the screen.p  pMoving on to GPU fragment shaders, these algorithms can be done essentially for free. Im working with OpenGL and CgGLSL, but this question should apply to Direct3DHLSL coders as well.p  pThe major problem is that these algorithms blend against neighboring pixels using some algorithm to decide on the color. However, I found this concept quite hard with shader languages. Generally with fragment shaders you are able to get a floating point texture coordinate, which you can use to do texture lookups, usually with GLLINEAR used as texture filter. Most pixels shaders use GLNEAREST, and do the smoothing themselves.p  pThe problem occurs if I want to find, say, the exact neighbor pixel. Ive seen some implementations but they occasionally cause artifacts on the screen. Probably due to floating point inaccuracies that occur. Ive found that most of the artifacts simply disappear when using poweroftwo sized textures, which further strengthens my belief there are floating point inaccuracies going on. Here is a sample fragment shader in Cg that shows the issuesp  precodestruct output     float4 color  COLOR   struct input    float2 videosize   float2 texturesize   float2 outputsize   struct deltas     float2 UL, UR, DL, DR    output mainfragment float2 tex  TEXCOORD0, uniform input IN, uniform sampler2D sp  TEXUNIT0     float2 texsize  IN.texturesize    float dx  powtexsize.x, 1.0  0.25    float dy  powtexsize.y, 1.0  0.25    float3 dt  float31.0, 1.0, 1.0     deltas VAR          tex  float2dx, dy,       tex  float2dx, dy,       tex  float2dx, dy,       tex  float2dx, dy         float3 c00  tex2Dsp, VAR.UL.xyz    float3 c20  tex2Dsp, VAR.UR.xyz    float3 c02  tex2Dsp, VAR.DL.xyz    float3 c22  tex2Dsp, VAR.DR.xyz     float m1dotabsc00c22,dt0.001    float m2dotabsc02c20,dt0.001     output OUT    OUT.color  float4m1c02c20m2c22c002.0m1m2,1.0    return OUT  codepre  pIs there some way to make sure that we can grab the color data from the pixel we expect and not a different one I believe this problem occurs since we might be query a pixel from a coordinate that is just between two pixels if that makes sense. Hopefully there is some builtin function into these shader languages Im overlooking.p

Negative 816 pIf I have an a composite index on a, b I understand that queries only concerned with a will still use the composite index but not queries concerned with bp  pMy question is whether there is any valid reason to have a singlecolumn index on a if I have the a, b index  What Ive read has seemed vague as to whether the a,b index was a complete substitute for a, or merely a better than nothing index.p  pThis assumes that I do filtering by both a and a,b.  I have a table with way too many indexes that is hurting write performance and want to double check before dropping indexes that Im only fairly sure are not doing any good.p  pAlso, does this answer change depending on whether I am using InnoDb or MyISAM  The table concerned is MyISAM, but most of our tables are InnoDb.p
Negative 816 pI am working with the Google Engine for a class, and I had a question about css tabbed menus.

I have no idea what types of stuff you might need, but I basically copied that code exactly, and used the app engine and template inheritance to get the different page info.

Negative 816 pI am going through a bit of a design dilemma, I have been targeting Android 2.3.3 and have a custom implementation of a ContentProvider. I then have a class of static methods to abstract the Content provider  providing me with objects representing each entity row based upon my query. For a while I was very comfortable with working like this, until I started wanting to use the whole collection in a number of places, for performing hit tests and drawing to the screen. I then had the headache of keeping my object representations up to date, and at this point have decided I need to step back and reconsider where to take this.p  pAs I say, I am presently using 2.3.3, and realise that in 3.0 CursorLoader overcomes a lot of the problems I have encountered. I still need to support smart phones though, so unless there will be a backport I cannot do this.p  pAs an interim solution I started to register notifyChange listeners so that I can rebuild a collection with my original query, but this strikes me as very CPU intensive and potentially slow. I havent yet decided whether I should roll back from using my static facade and instead use the now obsolete managedQuery call from Activity.p  pI therefore have two questions p  p1 Is there a preferrable way to avoid the issues with working against a collection based around a contentProviderp  p2 Have you any advice on working with raw cursors in an activity Should I be making objects out of them or working with the cursor asis I certainly feel they should be in an AsynTask while performing the query, but after that can I use them anywherep

Negative 816 pOur multithreaded application does a lengthy computational loop. On average it takes about 29 sec for it to finish one full cycle. During that time, the .NET performance counter a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryx2tyfybc28vvs.7129.aspx relnofollow time in GCa measures 8.5 . Its all made of Gen 2 collections. p  pIn order to improve performance, we implemented a pool for our large objects. We archieved a 100 reusement rate. The overall cycle now takes only 20 sec on average. The  time in GC shows something between 0.3...0.5. Now the GC does only Gen 0 collections.  p  pLets assume, the pooling is efficiently implemented and neglect the additional time it takes to execute. Than we got a performance improvement of roughly 33 percent. How does that relate to the former value for GC of 8.5 p  pI have some assumptions, which I hope can be confirmed, adjusted and amended p  p1 The time in GC if I read it right does measure the relation of 2 time spans p  ul liTime between 2 GC cycles and li liTime used for the last full GC cycle, this value is included into the first span.li ul  pWhat is not included into the second time span, would be the overhead of stopping and restarting the worker threads for the blocking GC. But how could that be as large as 20 of the overall execution time p  p2 Frequently blocking the threads for GC may introduce contention between the treads It is just a thought. I could not confirm that via the VS concurrency profiler. p  p3 In contrast to that, it could be confirmed that the number of page misses performance counter Memory  Page Faultssec is significantly higher for the unpooled application 25.000 per second than for the application with the low GC rate 200 per second. I could imagine, this would cause the great improvement as well. But what could explain that behaviour Is it, because frequent allocations are causing a much larger area from the virtual memory address space to be used, which therefore is harder to keep into the physical memory And how could that be measured to confirm as the reason here p  pBTW GCSettings.IsServerGC  false, .NET 4.0, 64bit, running on Win7, 4GB, Intel i5.

And choosing between a fragment with the panel markup and an error fragment is not the robust support Im looking for.

Negative 816 pI am writing a log file decoder which should be capable of reading many different structures of files. My question is how best to represent this data. I am using C, but am new to OOP.p  pAn example The log files have a range of sensor values. One sensor reading can be called strongAstrong, another strongBstrong. Obviously, there are many more than 2 entry types. In different log files, they could be stored either as ABABABABAB or AAAAABBBBB.p  pI was thinking of describing this as blocks of entries. So in the first case, a block would be AB, with 5 blocks. In the second case, the first block is A, read 5 times. This is followed by a block of B, read 5 times.p  pThis is quite a simplification there are actually 40 different types of log file, each with up to 40 sensor values in a block. No log has more than 300 blocks.p  pAt the moment, I store all of this in a datatable. I have a column for each entry, with a property of how many to read. If this is set to 1, it continues to the next column in the block. If not, it will assume that it has reached the end of the block.p  pThis all seems quite clumsy. Can anyone suggest a better way of doing thisp  pThanks for any helpp

It works as suchp  precode class ProductsController lt ApplicationController   def show       product  Product.findparams[id]       product.views  1       product.save   end     ....  end codepre  pThis counter works fine on my local host, but on Heroku, there is an errorp  precode NoMethodError undefined method  for nilNilClass codepre  pNow I have done some trouble shooting  the product variable is definitely not nil. I have, for example, replaced the viewssave lines with p  precode redirectto rootpath if product.nil codepre  pwhich didnt redirect to rootpath  showing that the variable isnt really nil. Why is heroku doing this What can I do to fix itp

Negative 816 pIm writing some Java code that depends on some Scala code that I have also written.  Trying to supply an argument with a parameterized type seems to work if the Scala is compiled with 2.8.0 but fail if I use 2.9.1.p  pThe simplified Scala code looks roughly like thisp  precodepackage test  import collection.JavaConversions.  class SomeClass    def foonumbers java.util.Set[Long]      numbers.foreachprintln     codepre  pThis compiles happily with both the 2.8.0 and 2.9.1 compilers.  The Java code looks something like thisp  precodepackage test  import java.util.Arrays import java.util.HashSet import java.util.Set  public class App       public static void mainString[] args          new SomeClass.foonew HashSetltLonggtArrays.asList1L, 2L, 3L        codepre  pIf I compile the Scala with the 2.8.0 compiler, then the Java will compile happily with Javas 1.6.026 compiler.  However, if I compile the Scala with 2.9.1, then the Java compiler fails with the errorp  precodetestApp.java16 foojava.util.Setltjava.lang.Objectgt in test.SomeClass cannot be applied to java.util.HashSetltjava.lang.Longgt             sc.foonew HashSetltLonggtArrays.asList1L, 2L, 3L                1 error codepre  pSo it seems that while Scala 2.8.0 retains in the bytecode the information that codenumberscode is of type codeSetltLonggtcode, the 2.9.1 compiler emits bytecode where codenumberscode is a codeSetltObjectgtcode.p  pIs this a bug  Is it an unfortunate for me sideeffect of a deliberate change The Scala a hrefhttpwww.scalalang.orgnode43 relnofollowchangeloga mentions various fixes in ... codeJavaConversionscode for smoother interoperation.  If so, is there anything I can do to get this to work with 2.9.1  p

Negative 816 pI have multiple SVGs, some of them rather large 11MB and theyre created from a PDF using a hrefhttpwww.pdftron.compdf2svgpdf2svga.p  pThe problem is, that the SVG is too big, takes long time to open, and is unnecessarily complex. It contains mostly text and some images think newspaper, and the text is split into little chunks of characters, not even words.p  pstrongI need to optimize it, first to reduce size, and also to reduce the amount of elements to make it load faster. The only thing I thought of so far is looking at characters which are at one line, and join them in a single codelttspangtcode.strongp  pThis should reduce the amount of text elements by quite a significant margin, because it looks like its mostly groups of 15 letters.p  pBut I am looking for some more things I can do to the SVG to reduce the size. Theres also a main font, which is used for about 95 of the text, but as it is right now, all of the text is defined as glyphs rendered shapes. p  pstrongIs it possible to just embed the font, so the text is rendered as text, and not as shapesstrongp  pAlso if you know of any better library for converting PDFs to SVG, Id appreciate any input. The only requirement is that it the SVG output should look exactly the same as the PDF.p  pId also like to note that speed isnt really important. It doesnt matter how long the conversion takes, as long as it produces the required result.p
Negative 816 pstrongEDITstrong I have added the ASM at the end.p  pI believe the best way to learn how to write good code on a platform is to experiment with the platform and thereby get to understand it. Therefore, this question is seeking to create a better understanding of the CLR, and is not at attempt at nano optimization.p  pNotwithstanding, it had occurred to me that it would be faster to fuse the two operations of setting and evaluating a variable. As it turns out, it is. In the code below, the 2nd loop executes in about 60 of the time of the first loopp  precodeprivate sealed class Temp      public int val   private void button13Clickobject sender, EventArgs e      Temp t  new Temp     Temp t1      int T1  Environment.TickCount      for int i  0 i lt 1000000000 i              t1  t          if t1.val  1000                      t1.val  0                    int T2  Environment.TickCount      for int i  0 i lt 1000000000 i              if t1  t.val  1000                      t1.val  0                    int T3  Environment.TickCount      MessageBox.ShowT2  T1.ToString  Environment.NewLine          T3  T2.ToString  Environment.NewLine          t.val.ToString  codepre  pIn most cases like this, the CIL compiler creates a duplicate of the set value on the stack, which means that the usually needed store and fetch is not needed. This would account for the apparently significant speed increase.p  pHowever, the decompiled C and IL for emthis particular piece of code doesem not do this, but rather emaddsem overhead. Yet its almost twice as fast.p  pstrongEDIT2strong I switched the loops around physically, and discovered that the second loop is always about twice as fast. Why So I added a warm up loop, which resulted in the first loop being about twice as fast. Its basically the same code ASMwise.

Negative 816 pI am fairly new to unit testing. I am in school, and currently taking junior projects. We have a web application to write. We are going to use C and asp.net. We are currently doing all the requirements, architecture, and i am responsible for the Quality Assurance and picking the right framework. We have a ton of paperwork to complete and i am trying to get my QA plan finished.p  pI am not sure what to use for unit testing. Although, we will be using asp.net i dont think we have the need to use MVC at this point. For simplicity sake should we just use visual studio built in functionality to  Generate an ASP.NET unit test Or, should i look into using Nunit or something like itp  pKeep in mind this is just a school project.

Negative 816 pI am stuck and need helpadvise. I am pretty sure that I am not the first one to run into this problem, but I cant seem to find the answer on the web.p  pWe are collecting all kinds of data from many factories. This is mainly forecasted values of yearly peak production, etc. This data collection is repeated every year.p  pWe currently keep track of this data in Excel, which has the following structurep  precodeFactory  2010  2011  2012  ..  A         20    30    28   .. B               39    55   .. codepre  pIn this example factory B just starts production in the year 2011. If we collect data for an additional year, we simply add a column. If forecasted data changes, we simply enter the new values and lose the old ones. You can imagine that this way of working has its limitations the table becomes rather sparse for missing data. Old values cannot be traced back. There is no reference to the source of the values. p  pTo satisfy our need for a better system, I put my antique knowledge of databases to work. In Access 2007 I created the following structurep  pTable Factoriesp  precodeFacID   FactoryName  1       A 2       B codepre  pTable Sourcesp  precodeSouID  Source     SourceDate  1      DocumentX  Sep. 2009  2      DocumentY  Jan. 2010 codepre  pTable Parametersp  precodeParID  FacID  SouID  ParamType       Year  Value  1      1      1      PeakProduction  2010  20 2      1      1      PeakProduction  2011  30 3      1      1      PeakProduction  2012  28 4      2      1      PeakProduction  2011  39 5      2      2      PeakProduction  2012  55 codepre  pFor each new data collection we just add a new source document and append the Parameters table. In this way, we can always revert back to old data. Furthermore, if additional years are collected, there is no need to add additional columns to any table.p  pAlthough the actual setup is more complex, above examples is sufficient to illustrate the problem that I am running into To enter data into the database I would like to have a single form which resembles the original Excel sheet layout, i.e.p  precodeFactory  2010  2011  2012   A                          B                          codepre  pOf course, this form will have some dropdown menu to select the source document and parameter type PeakProduction in the example. p  pMy question With crosstab queries it is easy to create such a view based of existing data in the database, however, entering new values is not allowed.

Negative 816 pIm looking for a solution to schedule the deletion of an object across threads. The docs about how codedeleteLatercode behave are not entirely clear. Can I call this function in a thread which is not the objects owner  p  pFor example, Object X is owned by Thread A, and in Thread B I would like to have Object X deleted. As the object may be inside event processing at the moment in Thread A I cant safely delete it until it gets back to the message loop. If I call codedeleteLatercode from Thread B however the docs seem to indicate it will delete as soon as Thread B gets back to the message loop.p  pCurrently I take the approach of having a signal emitted in Thread A which is attached to a slot which calls codedeleteLatercode. Im wondering if there is perhaps an easier way to do this  if indeed I can just call codedeleteLatercode from any thread.p

Negative 816 pMy IPhone app is suddenly giving a SIGABRT error message when I attempt to run it on my iPhone, before even the first line of the application delegate is reached. It runs fine in the simulator, and even restoring previously working snapshots give the same error when I attempt to load the application on the device.p  pI fiddled with the Product Name build setting and the data model prior to the problem occurring, but as mentioned, old snapshots that ran fine now wont load, suggesting that the problem isnt in the code.p  pI have tried restarting xCode, the computer, the iPhone and deleting the app but the problem is still occurring.p  pI am sure that the problem lies with the devicep  pAny ideas what the problem might be or how I can fix it p
Negative 816 pIm trying to compile PyPy on cygwin, and the compilation stops when python tries to open the file externmod, which was just compiled with gcc.  The problem with gcc on cygwin is that it automatically appends a .exe to whatever youre compiling, so even though gcc is called as codegcc shared Wl,enableautoimagebase pthread o tmpusessionrelease1.8sharedcacheexternmodcode, the output file ends up being codeexternmod.execode regardless.  So python tries to open codetmpusessionrelease1.8sharedcacheexternmodcode and cant find itthus the compilation stops.  Anyone know how to solve this, short of recompiling gcc  I dont  want to do that.p

Negative 816 pIm new here and Im not that very good in CPU consumption and Multi Threading. But I was wondering why my web app is consuming too much of the CPU process What my program does is update values in the background so that users dont have to wait for the processing of the data and will only need to fetch it upon request. The updating processes are scheduled tasks using executor library that fires off 8 threads every 5 seconds to update my data.p  pNow Im wondering why my application is consuming too much of the CPU. Is it because of bad code or is it because of a low spec server 2 cores with 2 database and 1 major application running with my web appp  pThank you very much for your help.p

Negative 816 pOk, for those in the know that are masters in Excel VBA, I have a pull down menu of companies that is populated by a list on another tab. Three columns, Company, Job , and Part Number. p  pWhat I have going on is that when a job is created I need a folder for said company to be created, and then a subfolder created based off of said Part Number.  So if you go down the path it would look like thisp  pcodeCImagesCompany NamePart Numbercodep  pNow if either company name or Part number exists dont create, or overwrite the old one. Just go to next step. So if both folders exist nothing happens, if one or both dont exist create as required. p  pDoes this make sense p  pIf someone can help me with understanding how this works and how to make it work it would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 816 pI am using several bound ListBox controls on an Access form. The ListBox contents are related, so that, besides other things, when the user clicks on one ListBox, the selected row can change in others. All works fine, I have done this many times, as long as the ListBox has a single column. I use the supersimple VBA syntax      lstBoxWhosis  SomeTextp  pand as long as the ListBox does contain that item, the selected row becomes the one containing that text, with no other search, find or reposition commands necessary.p  pMy current headache is a multicolumn ListBox. The leftmost column does not have unique entries, and when I use the above syntax, I get a reposition, but only to the FIRST row containing the text. I need to position according to the values in TWO columns. Is there some similar way to do this with multiple columns, or must I resort to searching the ListBox contents manuallyp  pIve already tried concatenating the columns with space, comma and semicolon, also the syntaxp  blockquote   plstBoxWhosis  arraySomeText1,SomeText2p blockquote  pNo luck with any of those.p  pRemoup  pI am doing it that way now, and its actually fairly simple. Heres the codep  precodelstSpoje  lstKatastr Do Until lstSpoje.Column1  lstOblast   lstSpoje.SelectedlstSpoje.ListIndex  1  True Loop codepre  pThe first line positions directly to the start of the block in the first column, the second steps by one, checking the second column until it gets the correct row. The number of duplicates does not warrant a more efficient searching method. It works okay, except the display flutters during the repositions.p  pOtherwise, I posted everything I thought was pertinent. The ListBoxes are bound, as I stated in the very first sentence, which means they are based on a table or a query. If there is some other information that you think might help someone solve this, let me know what that might be.p  pRemoup  pYes, that would undoubtedly work. I actually already do something similar, one of the ListBoxes has almost 15,000 items, so to help the user locate stuff, I put in 26 CommandButtons, with letters, that move that ListBox to the start of that letter. I use the following code to positition the ListBoxp  precodex  ActiveControl.Caption i  CurrentDb.OpenRecordsetSELECT Count FROM TableOfKatastrs WHERE LeftKatastr,1lt amp x amp .Fields0 lstKatastr.Selectedi  True codepre  pI may go to a similar scheme for this  it would get rid of the flickering problem and be faster to boot. But I was hoping for some littleknown syntax with the simplicity of my first example, where one line of code does EVERYTHINGp  precodelstBoxWhosis  SomeText codepre  pRemoup  pId settle for two, since Im using two columns.  But seriously, the simple assignment syntax is so straightforward and elegant, and theres so often some odd phrasing that is little used, little known, that solves problems like this. Ive tried all sorts of other things, likep  precodelstSpoje.Column1  SomeText2 codepre  pbut all I get is syntax errors. Maybe it really is only applicable to the first or only column.p

Negative 816 pI maintain a test suite utilizing Selenium and Capybara.  While I can convince Selenium to access pages outside of my home domain, it appears that Capybara cannot track the URL in the browsers address bar.  I tracked this deficiency down to behavior in SeleniumWebDriver, which is Rubys binding to Selenium 2.p  pGoogling around, it looks like Selenium has what appears to be a mode you can set it in, which enables crossdomain operation.  However, I find no reference to anything specific.p  pSome folks on StackOverflow talk about using either Chrome or Firefox with elevated privileges, but again, Im just not finding any information on using such features.  Inevitably, these questions end up unanswered.p  pStill other popular SO suggestsions talk about using the open command to explicitly bring the browser to a new site.  This isnt acceptable for the obvious reason that users dont type domain names as a general rule.  For example, if I visit, say, youtube.com, and find a video I like with a Twitter icon under the description, then clicking on that Twitter button should direct me to an appropriate twitter.com address.  The user does not have to type the twitter address manually.  Making use of seleniums open command breaks the test, because the test no longer reflects user behavior it emulates someone actually typing an address in the bar, and thus breaks the intent of the test, which is to confirm whether or not the twitter button actually works as intended.p  pIm beginning to believe that true, automated crossdomain operation is simply impossible.p  pSo, basically, I have two questionsp  p1 Given a test script which opens Selenium on, say, www.example.com, and I ask Selenium to click on a link which directs the browser elsewhere, is it possible to somehow capture the URL the browsers address bar reads after the click succeeds  And 2 Knowing that it is possible, how do I do it  Im simply not finding any information on this.  If I read session.driver.browser.currenturl, it would still report a URL on example.com, not the browsers current URL.p  pIm not quite sure how to provide sample source code to help illustrate what I want in a way that wouldnt confuse the matter with irrelevant detail, but if folks want sample source code, please let me know, and Ill try to whip something up.p  pThank you for your help.p

I want to support multiple compilers, so I decided to use codeAddOptioncode so the user can specify which compiler to use on the command line with the default being whatever their current compiler is.p  precodeAddOptioncompiler, dest  compiler, type  string, action  store, default  DefaultEnvironment[CXX], help  Name of the compiler to use. codepre  pI want to be able to have builtin compiler settings for various compilers including things such as maximum warning levels for that particular compiler. This is what my first attempt at a solution currently looks likep  precodeif iscompilerg     from buildscripts.gcc.std import cxxstd     from buildscripts.gcc.warnings import warnings, warningsdebug, warningsoptimized     from buildscripts.gcc.optimizations import optimizations, preprocessoroptimizations, linkeroptimizations elif iscompilerclang     from buildscripts.clang.std import cxxstd     from buildscripts.clang.warnings import warnings, warningsdebug, warningsoptimized     from buildscripts.clang.optimizations import optimizations, preprocessoroptimizations, linkeroptimizations codepre  pHowever, Im not sure what to make the codeiscompilercode function look like. My first thought was to directly compare the compiler name such as clang against what the user passes in. However, this immediately failed when I tried to use codescons compilerdatallvm3.1objReleaseAssertsbinclangcode.p  pSo I thought Id get a little smarter and use this functionp  precodecxx  GetOptioncompiler def iscompiler compiler     return cxx[lencompiler]  compiler codepre  pThis only looks at the end of the compiler string, so that it ignores directories. Unfortunately, clang ends in g, so my compiler was seen to be g instead of clang.p  pMy next thought was to do a backward search and look for the first occurrence of a path separator  or , but then I realized that this wont work for people who have multiple compiler versions. Someone compiling with g4.7 will not register as being g.p  pSo, is there some simple way to determine which compiler was requestedp  pCurrently, only g and clang are supported and only their most recently released versions due to their c11 support, so a solution that only works for those two would be good enough for now. However, my ultimate goal is to support at least g, clang, icc, and msvc once they support the required c11 features, so more general solutions are preferred.p

Negative 816 pIm receiving an error sometimes for what should be a valid request as 400 OK when I PUT some arguments to a URL.p  pThe same URL and arguments will work 99 of the time, but Im seeing errors crop up in our logs.p  pIs that an obscure thing that can happen due to some factors or is something specific to my app causing the mishmash of strange headers Im guessing its the latter if theres no answers to the former p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pFor the comments, it is a relatively simple RESTful API that was written. Now its almost always giving back the right headers like 400 and body of error or 200 with body of ok. When a bad header makes it to the web client, the web client is pinging a reporting URL with the message it got so we can differentiate API errors between our web app and mobile apps. As far as we know there is no combintation of code that would make this 400 OK hell. But seeing as it seems impossible for that to happen outside of our code messing up, Im going to take a deeper look.p  pstrongUPDATE 2strongp  pOkay Ive delved deeper into our framework than I have in a long time and spoke with some devs. p  pIt returns the information via the AJAX call to the API to the browser.p  pThe browser detects a 400 OK and sends it back to our server, where we are getting this strange report. No one has seen this happen with their eyes, but the logs say its happening.p  pThere is literally zero code in our codebase that would return 400 OK since the only 400 in our HTTP header handlers are 400 bad requestp  pIm wondering now if theres some browserjqueryajax bug Ive stumbled into.p  pstrongUPDATE 3 because you cant have too much informationstrongp  pI checked how the browser sees whats wrong. A callback is fired on failure as reported by jQuery .ajax. We then have code like thisp  precodexhr.alwaysfunction    var request  [ this.type, this.url, this.data ].join ,       response  [ xhr.status, xhr.statusText, xhr.responseText ].join     .ajax      url    REPORTINGURL,     type   POST,      data   request  request, response  response      codepre  pAnd we know this works most of the time because we also received 400 error responses from these ajax callsp  pstrongUPDATE 4strongp  pI just noticed that literally all the errors came from user agentp  pcodeMozilla webkit etc......

Id like to eliminate the need for framework express session management wherever possible as recommended by linkedin to improve performance so I thought of a couple solutions for authentication.p  p1 Write custom authentication that persists the session as a document and checks it wherever a request is made to the node.js server that needs authentication. Keep all user info in html5 storage or cookies for the dom to use for templating.  Works  Have to write custom security to avoid session management in expressnode.p  p2 Have 2 node.js instances. One serves everything in the public domain. One is for secure requests only. Still keep all user info in the session.  Simple as we can push session management onto the framework for requests that require authentication  Has 2 node instances. May have some bad DRY.p  pIs the second option reasonable Or is there another option Im missing. Option 1 is my fallback as Id rather not do all of the custom coding when its already built into express.p  pEDITp  pTo leave one possibility on here, I think I can use multiple callbacks on a resource request to allow an interceptor type pattern for validating user in session. This answers the first question.p  pFrom the express documentation Several callbacks may also be passed, useful for reusing middleware that load resources, perform validations, etc. app.getuserid, user.load, function    ...  p

Negative 816 pOn one of my servers which is being used for some internal development spaces and the likes, are configured with Apache, Git, Subversion among other things. The VirtualHost configuration is nothing out of the ordinary and I thought I had full control and understanding of this servers configuration and how it runs. I guess I was wrong. I recently discovered that all requests, no matter what VirtualHost I try, return the Subversion favicon when accessing codeltvhostgt.ltdomaingtfavicon.icocode. This puzzled me  and annoyed me a bit since I was convinced that I knew all about this servers configuration.p  pIt doesnt seem to pose any problems but Im annoyed that there is a configuration somewhere which does something I explicitly didnt ask for. So Ive been trying to track down this configuration but so far with no luck.p  pThe server is running Gentoo Linux, so I figured I was looking for a codeltLocationgtcode block somewhere in my Apache configuration. Ive been going through all my VirtualHost definitions, all my module configurations and my Apache configuration. Ive even gone so far as to codegrepcode for all codeltLocationgtcode and codefaviconcode entries in all of my codeetccode files. Still no luck.p  pIve run out of ideas as to how Im going to hunt down this thing so Im hoping for some help from you guys and girls.p  pThank you for your time p
Negative 816 pI am trying to generate all possible combinations of a sequence of length k given a certain alphabet this is to generate query sequences for a bioinformatics project.p  pThe sequences are of the formp  pA first character and last character that can be any of A C G U call these Y and k  2 characters in between that can be any of A C G U or  call these X.p  pe.g. if k  3 then the pattern is of the form YXY and if k  5 then YXXXY.p  pGenerating all possible sequences if k is known is easy, as you can just use k nested for loops. But if k is not known in advance, then this implementation does not fit.p  pThe total number of possible sequences can be expressed by 42  5k2. With k  3 this only gives 80 combinations, but scale that up to k  9 and you have 1,250,000p  pAny tips, ideas or suggestions would be much appreciated.p  pI need to use every sequence generated, so they need to be either stored in an array, or passed at creationgeneration to another function, it doesnt really matter which, although I would prefer not to have to store all of them.p  pMany Thanks.p  pN.B.

Negative 816 pI recently posted a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12040239saveemailuponsendinoutlookaddinquestiona about saving an email once its sent  I have just about everything working, except for one small detail. Basically, I am able to catch an email right before it sends, and do whatever I want with it  in my case, save it. However, if you try to access that emails CreationTime attribute, it returns January 1st 4501 at 12AM. This is most likely because it hasnt actually been created yet, in that it will be created in the Sent items folder as soon as my code finishes executing and it actually sends.p  pId like to leave this MailItem, which is about to be sent, untouched. I would like to duplicate it, change the CreationTime attribute of the duplicate to DateTime.Now, then save the duplicate, then allow Outlook to continue sending the original. However, when I attempt to modify the CreationTime, I get an error that that attribute is readonly. Is there any way to break into it Or any way to force a write or somethingp

Negative 816 pIm trying to understand MapReduce model and I need advice because Im not sure about the way how is sorted and partitioned file with intermediate results of map function. The most my knowledges about MapReduce I got from a hrefhttpwww.usenix.orgeventosdi04techfullpapersdeandean.pdf relnofollowMapReduce papers of Jeffrey Dean amp Sanjay Ghemawata and from Hadoop The Definitive Guide.p  pThe file with intermediate results of map function is compound of small sorted and partitioned files. These small files are divided into partitions corresponding to reduce workers. Then small files are merged into one file. I need to know how is partitioning of small files done. First I thought that every partition has some range of keys.p  pFor example if weve got keys as integer in range lt1100 and file is divided to three partitions then the first partition can consists of values with keys in range lt1,33, second partition with keys in range lt3466 and third partition lt67100. The same partitioning is in merged file too.p  pBut Im not sure about it. Every partition is send to corresponding reduce worker. In our example, if we have two reduce workers then partitions with first two ranges of keys lt1,33 and lt3466 can be sent to first worker and last partition to third worker. But if Im wrong and the files are divided in another way I mean that partitions hasnt got their own range of possible keys then every reduce worker can has results for the same keys. So I need somehow merge results of these reduce workers, right Can I send these results to master node and merge them therep  pIn short version I need explain the way how files in map phase are divided if my description is wrong and explain how and where I can process results of reduce workers.p  pI hope I described my problem enough to understand. I can explain it more, of course.p  pThanks a lot for your answers.p

Negative 816 pI have a data set that contains around 60,000 records. The delinquency date field is right after a field that deals with monetary values and sometimes users enter the monetary value in the delinquency date field by accident. Additionally, they sometimes enter the date as a string  August, 2st, 2011 or as the number of days delinquent 135 or 135 days. The most common entry method is in the mmddyy format 080211.p  pSadly, the programmers of this system refuse to devote the time to create validation for this field, so I must perform as much of it as I can after I have the data. Normally, I would handle this with a few simple formulas, however, there are 19 different ways users enter the data and I need to be able to handle each of them, and quickly. Loading the column into an array seems like the best option.p  pMy thought is to load the column into an array, loop through it, handling all entry options or deleting the ones that are completely messed up, then write it back to the worksheet. strongI know the datatype is the first problem with the array below, but Ive only used arrays once before in Excel VB and am not quite sure what I am doing wrong.

How can I trigger the dropwn menu after typing a number on the text field   Too tricky for a newbie , your help would be much appreciated p  precodelthtmlgt     ltheadgt lttitlegt Form lttitlegt     ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.4.0jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript typetextjavascriptgt     submit.clickfunctione       text.eachfunction        ifthis.val.length  0          this.cssborder, 2px solid red                   e.preventDefault           ltscriptgt     ltheadgt     ltbody gt     ltform idprovisiongt     ESNList    ltinput  typetext idESNList nameESNList size30 gt ltbr gt     ESN Startltinput typetext idESNStart nameESNStart size10 gt ltbr gt     ESN End ltinput typetext idESNStart nameESNStart size10 gt ltbr gt     UnitNameltinput typetext idSTxName nameSTxName size30  gt  ltbr gt        Unit Model   ltselect nameSTxNamegt     ltoption valuestx2gtSTX2ltoptiongt     ltoption valueprotopakgtProtopakltoptiongt     ltoption valuestm3 selectedgtSTM3ltoptiongt     ltoption valueacutecgtAcutecltoptiongt     ltoption valuemmtgtMMTltoptiongt     ltoption valuesmartonegtTrackpackltoptiongt     ltoption valuesmartoneb gtSmartOneBltoptiongt     ltoption valueaudigtAcutecltoptiongt     ltselectgt ltbr gt     RTU Model Type      ltselect namertumodelgt     ltoption valueglobalstargtGlobalStarltoptiongt     ltoption valuebothgtBothltoptiongt     ltoption valuecomtechgtComtechltoptiongt     ltoption valuestmcomtechgtSTMComtechltoptiongt     ltselectgt ltbr gt     ltinput typesubmit value submit  gt     ltformgt     ltbodygt     lthtmlgt codepre
Negative 816 pI have a video embedded using iframe. Just the standard code you get from YouTube.p  pIve been searching online to find a solution. That solution is that I would have a table underneath the embedded video and each table entry is a link.

In one of files in this common project, I need to check if the device orientation is supported or not.p  pI have retrieved the supported orientations in an array using p  precodeNSArray supportedOrientations  [[[NSBundle mainBundle] infoDictionary]     objectForKeyUISupportedInterfaceOrientations]  codepre  pmy method has signaturep  precodeBOOL isInvalidOrientation UIDeviceOrientation orientation  codepre  pI need to check if current orientation is supported or not, i.e I nee to check if current orientation is there in supportedOrientations array or not. p  pI am unable to do that because when I use p  precode[supportedOrientations containsObjectself.currentOrientation] codepre  pI get an error saying Implicit conversion of UIDeviceOrientation to id is disallowed with ARC.p  pIt is because they are incompatible types. How do I check it p
Negative 816 pIm using fastcgi for my ajax pages, parsing and encoding with jsonspirit.  Im also very new to cp  pIm having trouble figuring out how to access the post data.p  pI cut my teeth on .net amp php, and those would conveniently convert a json data string speaking in jQuery here, so my vocab is probably off to simple variables or codePOSTcode array respectively.p  pIm looking at the main example for reading POST data on fastcgi a hrefhttpwww.nongnu.orgfastcgippdoc2.1a00003.html relnofollowhttpwww.nongnu.orgfastcgippdoc2.1a00003.htmla, but it only shows codeitgtfirstcode and codeitgtsecond.valuecode.  I cant find anything in the linked docs on that page.p  pSince I dont have the http knowledge to articulate this properly, is there a way to read a jQuery codeajaxcode codedatacode string, for example, codefoo bar, jim bobcode by codefoocode and codejimcode in fastcgip  pIf not, should the codeitgtfirstcode simply be treated as a string to be parsed by jsonspirit p

Negative 816 pFirst of all, Ive done a fair amount of looking around, and while questions get around answers, I have a problem I think is somewhat unique. I have a list of checkboxes generated with the following code p  precodelt for student in Student.findall gt     ltdivgt     lt checkboxtag user[studentids][], student.id, currentuser.students.include    student gt     lt student.name gt     ltdivgt lt end gt codepre  pAfter clicking the update button at the bottom, I need each of the checked boxes to be placed into an array. I then plan on iterating over the array and doing some work on each of the checked names. I am having a hard time, however, with the process of getting these names all into an array. I really am not sure which of the standard web actions this kind of work should be i.e, post, get, etc., so I dont know how to set up a route. Even if I could set up a route to a controller, how would I get the checked students into an array of Student objectsp  pThanks ahead of time for your helpp

Negative 816 pI started developing my app for iOS 6 and got it working there, now I am having to make sure it also supports iOS 5.1 so it will work on the iPad 1.

Only the view for the current view controller is faded out. Even weirder is that during the transition this view is rotated 90 degrees as it is fading out. Ive included a screen capture below.

Negative 816 pIm wondering if its possible to position elements with codeposition absolutecode outside the viewport in iOS6. p  pEven when I use codeltmeta nameviewport contentwidth640, maximumscale0.5, initialscale0.5, minimumscale0.5 gtcode it makes viewport have more width if an element is positioned with like coderight 0 marginright 100pxcode 100px out of the viewport. p  piOS tries to include this element in the viewport which is not what I want.

Up to here its all OK.p  pBut the fact is that model objects, need the User, Company, etc data when the classes are first created so they can get the default values. F.Ex If you create a new invoice, its nice to get the user customer assigned warehouse or payment type.p  pAnd as per working requeriments, the DB engine needs company or user data for making things like getting the DB one per company or saving log entries with user info.p  pUntil the day that objects where passed on every call to DB engine classes or even methods, but now Im refactoring this and I thought It would be cleaner and less memory consuming if that info could be got directly on the respective places from SW.p  pBut there is crossdependency between them.

Negative 816 pin my controller action Im trying to add new image to database. Image requires to be associated with the device, which is associated with the user.p  pSo I have my entity classessp  precodepublic class Image     public int Id  get set     public string Url  get set      [Required]    public virtual Device  get set    public class Device     public int Id  get set     public string Name  get set      [Required]    public virtual User  get set    public class User     public int Id  get set     public string Login get set     public virtual ICollectionltDevicegt Devices  get set      [Required]    [DataTypeDataType.EmailAddress]    public virtual string Email get set   codepre  pNow when Im trying to add new image like thisp  precodevar image  new Image  image.Device  Db.DbSetltDevicegt.Find1  Db.DbSetltImagegt.Addimage  Db.DbSetltImagegt.SaveChanges codepre  pThe thing is that when I use this codeFindcode to lad existing device with user and all properties set right I dont get the correctly filled User property in the Device. Its like the lazy loading did not work. There is an instance of an codeUsercode object, but its id is set to 0 and it have all other fields set to its default values.p  pI have all navigation properties set as virtual, also lazy loading works okay on my other entities so its definitely not turned off or something.p  pThe funny thing is that when I change my code and comparison like below before I add my image then it loads user and works finep  precodeif AuthenticationHelper.CurrentUser  image.Device.User     return null codepre  pExactly like it manage to load user in this very moment.

Once I have done this, I can run the macro and it will be able to open ALL the files not just the first file that I save ased. p  pWhile this is annoying, its not the worst thing in the world. If there is a reason why excel is doing this, I would love to know If there is a solution to this problem, even betterp  pstrongProblem 2 Big problemstrong This is the main puzzle that I would like to solve. In the code above, the section that is missing is the part of the code that tells Excel or the macro where to find the files. I can do this by hardcoding in the path as followsp  pMethod 1p  precodestrDir  CwhateverPath codepre  pThis method ALWAYS works except when Problem 1 is encountered above. p  pHowever, this is clearly not the best way to write the macro, since I will not only be using it once, but will need to use it multiple times, and the data files I wish to import will be in various folders. Therefore, I tried to write it as followsp  pMethod 2p  precodeDim folderDialog As fileDialog  Set folderDialog  Application.FileDialogmsoFileDialogeFolderPicker folderDialog.AllowMultiSelect  False folderDialog.Show  strDir  folderDialog.SelectedItems1 codepre  pI compared strDir from Method 1 and strDir from Method 2 and found no discernable differences in their values. They both contain the correct path CwhateverPath.p  pHowever, using Method 2, excel will be unable to read any of the files in the selected folder. It will return with The same runtime error 1004 as above, and the quick fix I found for Problem 1 above does nothing to help the macro run.p  pIf anyone has any idea what is going on here, I would really appreciate some help figuring this out p

Negative 816 pI hope this isnt a duplicate. Im currently working on client server game based on netty with a client on Android. Im trying to make a secure login process so I tryed using ssl on top of java socket.p  pI managed to create a selfsigned certificate and to use SSL. The problem is that the example source code i found use  custom TrustManagerFactory which doesnt make any check upon certificate validity. Since I dont want to allow Man In The Middle attack i searched for more information on SSL handshake and here is what i understoodp  ol liTo initiate SSL session, the client send a request to the server. li liThe server which own the certificate.jks or .bks extract public informations into a X509 certificate and send it to the client.li liThe client check for the validity of the certificate  In my current solution do nothingli liIf check succed retrieve the servers public key from the certificate, generate a random key, encrypt it with the public key and sends it to the server.li liThe server use his private key to decrypt the randomly generated key.li liBoth client and server now share the same random key and they start a comunication using this key for symetric encryption  like AES .li ol  pI dont need to accept certificate from anyone else than my own server so i thought about 2 solutionp  ol liSave the X509 on client side and create  custom TrustManager witch only accept this certificate. This solution seems easy to implement but rather hard to maintain since every certificate change on server side would need to update X509 certificate on every client. li liCreate my own CA certificate sign my ssl certificate with this certificate and manage somehow to tel my client to only trust all certificate signed with my CA.li ol  pWhat i understood about CA authentification is this p  ol liA CA root certificate is a normal certificate that contain a key pair.li lisigning a certificate with a CA mean adding at the end of the beingsigned certificate a hash of the whole certificate encrypted with the CA private key. li lithis signature is contained in the X509 certificate along with some informations about CA.li liTo check certificate validity, the client generate certificate hash and compare it to the decrypted hash using CA public key contained in the X509 certificate.li ol  pSo if im not mistaking in all of this, if i want to implement my second solution, I need to provide a CA certificate to the client so that he can check certificates. Ive seen that it is possible to init  TrustManager with a truststore. I asume it must be a different certificate from the root CA one since the whole security of this depends on my CA private key s confidentiality. So my questions are p  ol liWhat should this client truststore contain and how to generate if from my root CA  li liI have red that ssl engine is broken for self signed certificate. So is my second solutions viable on androidli liIf this can work, how can i invalidate my certificate if i see that someone manage to get my private key somehow I have red things about crl but i dont know how to generateuse them in my truststoreli ol  pthanks in advance.p

Negative 816 p[EDITED]p  pI have been coding up a simple Shinybased implementation of a multibar chart using the rcharts wrapper for nvd3. When I produce the graphic locally from the R console, I am able to interact with it and the transitions work as expected. However, when wrapped in the shiny interface, it does not redraw, nor does it allow for interactions with the plot itself. p  pI have pasted in the code that I am using below along with a sample data set. When run with the sample data, it works great. However, my actual data set is significantly larger over 5k records in the trips dataset and over 100 entries in the stations dataset.

Negative 816 pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pI there is there internal web application that is crashing if you constantly switch back and forth between any pages.  This error show up in the creation of items as they involves several pages.  It is also preceeded for me other have not notice this issue with text display issues text on top of each other, icon fonts not showing up, etc....  If you hit the reload button on the error page, that page loads up fine.p  pThis error seems to only have in Chrome on Windows after about 45 mins of constantly loading pages.  I have tried FireFox on Windows for over 10 minutes without issue and Chrome on Mac OS  X for over 10 minutes without issue.p  pThe one thing I notices that I though might be the issue was that the memory usage kept increase with Chrome on Windows.  It would start at about 30MB and then general crash around 70MB80MB however I have notices most site in chrome on windows do this so I am not so sure about it being related.p  pstrongWhat I have triedstrongp  pI have tried a number of different thing to figure out the issue,p  pI first tried to enable crash logging through chrome itself however that seems to only send the crash data to google and I just have access to the ID.

Negative 816 pIm writing a subclass of EditText that allows the user to draw with his finger on it.

The first loop iterates over the entries in a row in your example this would be the letters e.g r1a r1b ect     The second inner loop iterates of the rows in you example this would be the number you had in your variables.     The sum over each of the three rows are added, then bound to 112 range, before being added to the forth row.     for cId  0 cId lt 7 cId          sum  0         for rId  0 rId lt 3 rId              sum  rows[rId][cId]                  arraypushrows[3], bindToRangesum           Same as above, but for the last two remaining values.

Negative 816 pI am trying to create some Glassware with the Mirror API. I am new to using AppEngine and Jinja2. I have python experience but never with a web framework before. So basically I am very new at this. p  pI have modified the Python quickstart for the mirror API to include many of my endpoints and designs. Basically I want to be able to be able to POST data from a constrained device to Glass. I have an endpoint all setup which works to accept and parse out the data and send the timeline item. p  pMy problem is that the device itself is acting all on its own and cannot provide input, therefore when I call my app from it e.g. codehttpsfoo.appspot.comoperationdeviceDatacode the app presents the auth page and then nothing happens. I can see in the logs that the auth page is being sent, but the device has no idea what to do with this.p  pBasically, I need a way where I can hardcode credentials and get around having to do oauth everytime. What is the recommended way to do this Another app which doesnt require auth which passes the data along This would be fine as I only need to set this up with one user right now, it is for an internal demo only.p  pIs it possible to set my credentials in a header and auth automatically without handling any return, more like how basic auth worksp  pThere are also the Simple API access keys. Would these work in this situation, I tried creating browser and server keys and tried them on the device and in the browser by doingcodehttpsfoo.appspot.comoperationdeviceDataampkeyKEYHEREcode but in both cases I was still prompted to login. Is this what simple access keys are for Do they not work with the mirror API p  pBasically my question is, whats the easiest way to allow access to my apps endpoints without having to oAuth or having a hard coded user which autoauthsp  pHere is the project that I started with a hrefhttpsgithub.comgoogleglassmirrorquickstartpython relnofollowhttpsgithub.comgoogleglassmirrorquickstartpythonap

Negative 816 pI am still relatively new to iOS programming. Here is a question that confused me for a long time.p  pSo in one of the view controllers, before this view controller is pushed into the navigation item, I am passing one parameter, say userId, to it in the codeprepareForSeguecode from previous view controller. And when this view controller is loading initialising based on the codeuserIdcode from the previous view controller, I am making a network call to fetch a list of information thats related to this user and then populating this information to the model of the current view controller.p  pWhere should I put the logic of this data preparationp

Negative 816 pI am building a Windows Phone 8 app for the financial sector. As it contains sensitive information such as credit card numbers, I need a 15 minute timeout on the Fast App Switching, i.e. if a user suspends the app and hits the Back button to get back to it within 15 minutes, it should resume. If longer than 15 minutes, it should redirect back to the login page.p  pI have tried using the OnNavigateFrom and To methods in conjunction with dispatcher timers, but there are 2 problems with this. 1, background processes dont run when the app is suspended, so the timer stops. 2, my app has multiple pages, and theres no warning given to the app that its about to be suspended. I cant differentiate between navigating from page to page within the app, and navigating away from the app completely.p  pSo, is it possible to have a timer running while the app is suspended Failing that, how do I turn off FAS completely and simply restart the login every time the app is resumed I know this goes against some of the Windows Phone 8 usability ethos, but the financial institutions who will use this app have certain requirements which need to be met.p  pThe Microsoft guidelines on this subject are herep  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsappshh465088.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsappshh465088.aspxap  pHere is an excerpt from this pagep  pStart the app fresh if a long period of time has elapsed since the user last accessed itp  pbut unfortunately theres no mention of how to actually do it... p  pEDITp  pThanks to crea7ors answer I now know about the ApplicationDeactivated and ApplicationActivated methods.

Negative 816 pEach sensor has resolution of 10 bits and there are 500 measurements per second. Also, we are storing timestamp of first measurement for each detection lets say we leave 32 bits for this.p  p500 measurments  10 bits  32 bits  5032 bits per detectionp  pLets assume that each detection lasts 1 sec and that there are 500 detections per hour per sensor. That leaves us with about 307KB per hour per sensor of data. Lets say that there are 10 sensors and we have 25,7GB of data per year without taking in account that we should also store identifiers for each sensor.p  pNow, 26GB isnt much and I guess that simple MySQL database could hold it. Problem is that later data will be processed using some heavy algorithms and data from different sensors will constantly be compared one to another.p  pExample of querys that could be madep  ul liget all detections of sensor3 and sensor4 if difference between two timestamps is less than 0.5s ie. matching detectionsli liget all detections on 1st of March 2014 if peak in measurements is greater than 900li licompare detection 3 from sensor1 and detection 7 from sensor7 ie. tells if detections match based on measurement data, not timestampli ul  pEach detection is essentially a curve.p  pQuestion is what solution to pick for database.

Negative 816 pI have an application that reads from a text file that is being simultaneously written to by another application. The application that reads the file opens it in text mode using C  fopen. The lines in the file can be big, like up to a few 100 megs in size. For this reason we have a function that reads chunks of 4K from the file using fgets and appends it in a string object until it manages to read a complete line. It is possible that the application which is writing into the file has written a partial line when a read attempt was made. Out custom ReadLine function handles this scenario by detecting endoffile, resetting the file pointer to last known good position, and discarding the text thats been read already. p  pHeres how that function looks likep  precodedefine MAXBUFSIZE 4096  bool ReadLineFILE fp, stdstringamp result, boolamp isEof       result.clear     long const lastOffset  ftellfp     bool hasReadOneLine  false     isEof  false      debugprintlastOffset      while hasReadOneLine ampamp isEof           char dataRead[MAXBUFSIZE]         memsetdataRead, 0, sizeofdataRead          if fgetsdataRead, MAXBUFSIZE, fp  NULL               if feoffp                  debugprintFlag 1                 isEof  true              else                  debugprintFlag 2                 result.clear                 fseekfp, lastOffset, SEEKSET reset the file pointer to where it was                 return false                                 result  dataRead         hasReadOneLine  result[result.length1]  n        end loop      if hasReadOneLine          debugprintFlag 3         result.clear         fseekfp, lastOffset, SEEKSET reset the file pointer to where it was         return false            drop the newline character ...     if result[ result.length1]  n          result.resizeresult.size  1           return true   codepre  pProblem  I have run into a scenario where after reading a full line from the file, the ReadLine function is returning the last chunk from the previously read line when it is called again to read the next line. I logged the value of lastOffset returned by the ftell and noticed that in that rare scenario the fgets has not moved the file pointer to the end of the line which it read. p  pI added some debug lines but in my case only thing that got printed was the lastOffset value.p  pIn the call where the ReadLine returned an incomplete line, the value of lastOffset is 21563617 Length of the incomplete line is 920p  pIn the call before where it returned a complete line, the value of lastOffset is 21442207 Length of the line read in this previous call is 122331 including newlinep  pMy question is has anyone ever encountered similar problem What is your opinion about what could be potentially going wrong I am not necessarily looking for a complete answer but just some pointers about what could potentially go wrong.p  p UPDATE p  pI managed to reproduce the problem with a small utility, writing in a file in chunks of 4K and with a sleep interval of 10 ms, while the other program that uses the function above reading from the same file simultaneously. p  pLooks like doing fseek to reset the filepointer is a bad option in the function above as resetting the filepointer to a previous position does not necessarily clear the Clibrarys own internal buffer. I am still not fully convinced with this explanation as in some cases repro cases the file pointer resetting never happened. p  pAnyway, I did some more search on the web, and some thread seemed to suggest using lowerlevel streams and handle the buffering in the library itself. So I have changed the implementation of the function above and its other helpers to do just that. I am now using sopensreadlseek for Windows and standard POSIX interface for LinuxSolaris to perform the lowerlevel IO handling. With these changes it seems to work, I am not seeing the issue anymore. p  pThank you all for your time. All your input is much appreciated.p  pSuman p  p UPDATE 2 p  pWell now I definitely know the reason. The problem is that ftell and fseek are unreliable if the file is opened in text mode. If the file is opened in binary mode, then the function above works fine.p  pHeres a link to an article where someone else found this issue before a hrefhttparstechnica.comcivisviewtopic.phpf20ampt420490 relnofollowhttparstechnica.comcivisviewtopic.phpf20ampt420490ap  pThis is a good thing, because now I have a fix that requires changing 1 line, instead of 200 p

I created the user in the same db and it works. It a very weird feature because I will have a lot of duplicated users in mongo, one for each DB that I have. Minus one for user managing in Mongo...p

I have a custom back button in the second screen, so for all intents and purposes it looks a lot like a navigation bar, only transparent, etc.p  pIs there a way that I can reenable the interactive pop, while still keeping the navigation bar hidden on the second view controller, but showing on the first one Im admittedly not quite sure what the transition would be, but just wondering whether this has a simple solution.p

Negative 816 pSo, we have a few versions of working ipas on TestFlight from our freelancer programmer. Every feature was tested out thoroughly. But once we have someone else compile the source code, something is always missing. Now we are thinking about distributing it through an Enterprise Developer Program. We havent decided since we are not 100 sure yet.p  pSo I want to know, is there any way to reuse the previous ipa without recompiling it, so that we can move it from our current company developer program to enterprise, and distribute from there Because if we hire someone to compile it, a lot of the functions will break again, it will be expensive and timeconsuming to fix.p  pI asked the Apples support, they told me to come here.p

Negative 816 pIm attempting to use sphinxdoc automodule in conjunction with Mocked out modules as per a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma15912502754456thisa answer. Specifically Im using Mock for PyQt5 module imports which are not available on ReadTheDocs.p  pStrangely, Im finding that any class that inherits from a Mocked modules class is not included in the resulting documentation. It appears as though sphinxdoc cant emseeem them for some reason. p  pMy slightlycustom Mock is as followsp  precodefrom mock import Mock as MagicMock   class MockMagicMock     all  [QApplication,pyqtSignal,pyqtSlot,QObject,QAbstractItemModel,QModelIndex,QTabWidget,         QWebPage,QTableView,QWebView,QAbstractTableModel,Qt,QWidget,QPushButton,QDoubleSpinBox,         QListWidget,QDialog,QSize,QTableWidget,QMainWindow,QTreeWidget,         QAbstractItemDelegate,QColor,QGraphicsItemGroup,QGraphicsItem,QGraphicsPathItem,         QGraphicsTextItem,QGraphicsRectItem,QGraphicsScene,QGraphicsView,]      def initself, args, kwargs         superMock, self.init       classmethod     def getattrcls, name         if name in file, path             return os.devnull         else             return Mock      classmethod     def setattrargs, kwargs         pass      def setitemself, args, kwargs         return      def getitemself, args, kwargs         return Mock codepre  pThe codeallcode is required to allow codefrom x import code style imports for the PyQt5 classes.p  pI can confirm that changing the superclass to codeobjectcode results in the classes being correctly documented, as does remove the Mock generating locally. Forcing the documentation by using codeautoclasscode results in a single line saying that the class inherits from codeMockcode.p

Negative 816 pI would like to use a domain name to point to a web page on the local servers IP address. However, the problem is that the page is linked to an IP address set up on port 8088 rather than 80 because the latter is already used by another web page. By the domain company I was told that they cannot do it because the domain can only point to an IP address set up on port 80. So now I am in a deadlock. What alternatives do I have and how can I make a domain pointing to the IP8088p  pThanksp

But to what size Having it too large might put the server stability at risk. One option is to get the row length the size in bytes for the actual data for all the columns for a record. Not an average in order for us to allocate sufficient buffer size dynamically.

Negative 816 pScenariop  ul liWe have a large product developed in C and Windows Forms, in which we have more than 50 developers working on different projects simultaneously. li liWe use TFS gatedcheckin to validate the build and execute tests.li liWe do not have load, performance or stress tests yet, but we do have 5000 unit and integration tests. li ul  pstrongHow to identify performance degradation during execution of unitintegration testsstrongp  pEventually, checkins introduce performance issues. In the worst case scenario, the change may affect the system horizontally, compromising the user experience in various use cases. p  pWe want to use our unit and integration tests to identify these problems. The pilot was a simple heuristic for each test, we store the result of the last execution by the gated and compare with the time elapsed during executions of new checkins.p  pSo far, the comparison involves a percentual and absolute tolerance to mitigate environmental instabilities and  addition of controlled complexity. The environment has almost no services running and resolves one checkin at a time. Moreover, the machine is dedicated. strongEven so, performance measurements vary significantly even when the same test runs without any changes in code.strongp  pWe do not utilize an average time obtained by a sample of executions the last execution time becomes the new benchmark of that test and the tests are executed in DEBUG mode. Our next attempt is to antecipate assembly loading and JIT parsing. Any other tips that could help finding candidates to this oscilation would be appreciated.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 816 pIm currently building a prototype app, using the latest beta version of Rails 4.2.p  pFor several parts of the system, I need to allow the user to select a default item in a list.p  pSo far, Ive implemented this as a default field on the models, and a uniqueness validation to ensure that theres only one default allowed.p  pOne of my business rules is to prevent the deletion of a default entity.p  pI could use a beforedestroy callback to do this  and that works fine  but Im also using the paranoia gem from a hrefhttpsgithub.comradarparanoia relnofollowhttpsgithub.comradarparanoiaa to give me softdelete capabilities. This overrides the destruction of models with an update call setting a deletedat field instead. Using a beforeupdate call isnt giving me the expected result, as the deletedat field isnt being set early enough.p  pIf the paranoia gem is going to cause me problems, Im happy to remove that requirement altogether. Soft deletion is a nice to have, rather than an essential feature at this stage.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions on how I can implement this logic, and just as importantly test that it works as expectedp

Negative 816 pI am attempting a simple register allocation with x86. Am using the linear register allocator but I have a few questions on some simple things which I am not finding the information about. p  precodeint main      int a, b, c     a  10     b  20     c  2     a  a  b     b  b  5     c  c  b  a     return c  codepre  pFor this simple code, ignoring constant propagation, g amp msvc generate similar code which pushes all temporaries on the stack and then uses eax, ebx etc only for ALU ops. Clang generates the following code with O0.p  precodemain                                    main     movl    0, 4rsp     movl    10, 8rsp     movl    20, 12rsp     movl    2, 16rsp     movl    8rsp, eax     addl    12rsp, eax     movl    eax, 8rsp     imull   5, 12rsp, eax     movl    eax, 12rsp     movl    16rsp, eax     imull   12rsp, eax     addl    8rsp, eax     movl    eax, 16rsp     movl    16rsp, eax     ret codepre  pAs is evident, that all temporaries are on the stack. So my question is based on this same thing. strongAt any point, should anything in eaxebx etc which are used in addmuldiv operations etc have a lifetime more than 1 instruction. That is, should any live range interval have its value stored in these registers or should they be evicted as soon as the register allocation is done and their values pushed to temporaries strongp  pOr can we use some of these registers till the next ALU instruction is encountered and do a lazy push to stack when necessaryp

Negative 816 pI know very little about VBA, but Im trying to design a userform for an excel workbook. The idea is click the button, bring up the userform, enter info, hit OK, and your info is formatted correctly and inserted into the worksheet. p  pI have 3 userforms that all work fine, but any macro I create that references one of them just does not recognize that that particular userform exists. p  pThe code Im having a problem with is pretty straightforwardp  precodePrivate Sub LiquidFormButtonClick  LiquidEntryUserform.Show  End Sub codepre  pEdit Update So I tried making a new userform, with a different name. I copied and pasted all of the controls from the object over to the new userform, changed the name of the macro to bring up the userform, and voila, it works. However, now the userform itself doesnt do anything because none of the controls actually have any codes behind them telling them what to do. Thats fine, Ill just copy over the codes from the broken form and BOOM now it doesnt work. Soooo something in the very very simple coding within the userform itself is preventing it from being shown, even though the new userform AND the broken one both, in fact, do everything else they need to do besides show up. Ill post the full userform code up later on after some dabbling. Thank youp

Negative 816 pIve found code examples that demonstrate templated user controls. They work fine for displaying data, but I cant get them to work for entering data.

Negative 816 pMost of the solutions Ive found to make d3gprahs to be responsive is all about the svgs viewbox and updating it on window resize. p  pThe problem with that is that it just simply resizes the svg. If you make the window smaller the font will get smaller, the graph will get tiny and so forth. If you start off with a small window and make it bigger it will only zoom in the svg.p  pHighcharts handles this pretty nice. But highcharts updates every object to fit the new size. If the page is heavy on the graphs, it will lead to some heavy burden on the browser. But still, its very nice and userfriendly.p  pIs there a similar way to do this for d3 or do I have to recount everything on window resizep
Negative 816 pI have a filewatcher setup on a folder. Everytime a subfolder is created, an event is raised in which i want to proceed and do some stuff with the files in that new folder.

Negative 816 pId like to switch things up a bit with my enemies in my SpriteKit game. Theyre just so... predictable. Ive been inspired by the sorts of enemies that are encountered in The Binding of Isaac Rebirth.p  pFor example, lets say Id like to implement enemies which split into two smaller enemies when codeenemy.health lt 50.0fcode. In a simple scenario, this could be done from my main scene update loop by iterating through all my enemies. Something likep  precodeifenemy.health lt 50 ampamp enemy.type  kEnemyTypeSplitsIntoTwo      CGPoint position1  CGPointMakeenemy.position.x20,enemy.position.y     CGPoint position2  CGPointMakeenemy.position.x20,enemy.position.y     [enemy killEnemy]     [self spawnNewEnemyWithTypeenemyType andHealth50 atPositionposition1]     [self spawnNewEnemyWithTypeenemyType andHealth50 atPositionposition2]  codepre  pThis will probably work for simple cases. But this is something that I definitely want to keep out of my main scene update loop. The problem is that my enemy class is effectively a subclass of codeSKSpriteNodecode.p  pFor situations like this, ideally Id like a new class such as a codeComplexEnemycode or codeEnemyGroupcode class to handle this so I can implement more complex enemy behaviours and patterns think epic boss fights with multiple phases. Id imagine this new class would likely derive from codeSKNodecode or even codeNSObjectcode and generate multiple codeEnemycode instances at certain points.p  pAm I thinking down the right path Id be interested to hear what means people have used to achieve this sort of behaviour, preferably with a couple of examples.p  pDCp  ptldr  Groups of enemies, bosses with multiple phases. How do you guys do itp

Negative 816 pIve got codeUIViewControllercode that Ive loaded from a codeUIStoryboardcode by sending it codeinitialViewControllercode it is not my Apps main storyboard. p  pI have an unwind segue used in that storyboard. Its exit point is in an unwind action of a codeUIViewControllercode that lives in scene strongof the mainstrong codeUIStoryboardcode. p  pI display this view controller with code, rather than with a segue.p  pIf I present the loaded view controller with codepresentViewControlleranimatedcompletioncode, the unwind segue works fine and finds the appropriate handler.p  pHowever, strongthe unwind segue does not work if I wrap up my presented view controller in a codeUIPopoverControllercodestrong, and then present the popover. I can breakpoint the unwind action and it doesnt get called.p  pIn their a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiostechnotestn2298index.html relnofollowtechnical note about how unwind segues worka, Apple cover the process of looking up a destination view controller.p  blockquote   pHow an Unwind Segue Determines its Destination View Controller   When an unwind segue is initiated, it must first locate the nearest view controller in the navigation hierarchy which implements the unwind action specified when the unwind segue was created. This view controller becomes the destination of the unwind segue. If no suitable view controller is found, the unwind segue is aborted.p      pStarting from the view controller that initiated the unwind segue the search order is as followsp      ol   lipThe next view controller in the responder chain is sent a codeviewControllerForUnwindSegueActionfromViewControllerwithSendercode message. For a view controller presented modally, this will be the view controller that called codepresentViewControlleranimatedcompletioncode. Otherwise, the codeparentViewControllercode.   The default implementation searches the receivers codechildViewControllerscode array for a view controller that wants to handle the unwind action. If none of the receivers child view controllers want to handle the unwind action, the receiver checks whether it wants to handle the unwind action and returns self if it does. In both cases, the codecanPerformUnwindSegueActionfromViewControllerwithSendercode method is used to determine if a given view controller wants to handle the unwind action.pli   lipstrongIf no view controller is returnedstrong from codeviewControllerForUnwindSegueActionfromViewControllerwithSendercode in step one, strongthe search repeats from the next view controller in the responder chainstrong.pli   ol blockquote  pNote my emphasis of the second point.p  pSo, as far as I can see, what Im doing should, somehow, emjust workem. The unwind segue will bubble up the responder chain, out of the presented view controller, in to the codeUIPopoverControllercode out in to whatever is presenting that, and on up the chain  eventually finding my unwind handler.p  pIts not working though. Any ideas why not p

Negative 816 pIve been developing for Android for a few months now, and this question arises again and again what is the motivation behind addition of completely new features APIs to support libraries without them being available in the standard SDKp  pstrongExamplestrongp  pa hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidsupportv13appFragmentTabHost.htmlFragmentTabHosta API is available only through codeandroid.support.v4.app.FragmentTabHostcode. It is fine most of the time, but if you want to use fragments nesting and a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidpreferencePreferenceFragment.htmlPreferenceFragmenta together, youre dead in the waters  nesting requires you to switch to codeandroid.support.v4.app.Fragmentcode for supporting below 4.2, but there is no implementation of PreferenceFragment in this support lib. As a consequence you either implement custom workarounds, or use third party libraries that have already implemented them see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9783368alternativestopreferencefragmentwithandroidsupportv4this questionap  pemEdit as pointed out by eugen in his answer, I myself referenced FragmentTabHost from supportv13, which supports native Fragments. However, this information does not change the overall question. In fact, if I wouldve used this API with fragments nesting, my app wouldnt run on 30 of devices today native fragments support nesting from 4.2 onwards.emp  pstrongExamplestrongp  pAnother issue that I encountered today and wasted too much time on is with a hrefhttpsdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidsupportv7appActionBarDrawerToggle.htmlActionBarDrawerTogglea available through codeandroid.support.v7.app.ActionBarDrawerTogglecode. I wanted to use this functionality, therefore I added the entire codecom.android.supportappcompatv721.0.code to projects dependencies. I guessed that this will do, but I was wrong  my app did not compile missing resources referenced by the support library. After trying few tricks from the web, I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26431676appcompatv72100noresourcefoundthatmatchesthegivennameattrandrothis questiona which finally provided the solution. In short v7 support library has dependency on  SDK, therefore I had to define codecompileSdkVersion 21code.p  pstrongConsequencesstrongp  pNow, I tell myself FragmentTabHost havent been added to any SDK version yet, which implies that even 45 years from now developers will continue to use supportv4 lib for providing this functionality because even if this API is added today, it will take years before you could safely assume that all target devices support it natively, right The same argument applies to codeandroid.support.v4.widget.DrawerLayoutcode and other APIs present only in support libraries.p  pIf developers bound to use support libraries for years, this also imply that they are bound to experience the above inconsistencydependency issues long after these issues could have already been resolved, rightp  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pWhy would Google want to keep these libraries forever Wont it be better for everybody if all the new APIs were added to SDK in parallel to compatibility libs, such that compatibility libraries could age and retire at some pointp  pemEdit following eugens answer Im now puzzled even more  some APIs evolve with newer support libs, but do not make it into main SDK like FragmentTabHost, which evolved from supportv4 to supportv7. What is the reason for not adding them to SDKemp

Negative 816 pI have an API server written in NodeJS with Express, and an iOS app written in Swift which supports IOS 7 and up.p  pIn the app, users can select a new profile image, which is resized to a small size, uploaded to the API server as JSON and stored in a MongoDB database as a Base64encoded string. The current datetime is stored along with the encoded file so the server knows when the file was last updated. This mechanism can be changed if necessary.p  pThe app displays the profile images of other users, so it downloads them via an HTTP GET request using NSURLSession.dataTaskWithRequest. Each users profile image has a distinct url e.g. p  pa hrefhttpserverportmyserverapiusers12345profile.jpg relnofollowhttpserverportmyserverapiusers12345profile.jpgap  pThe URL always stays the same for each user profile, but the stored image changes whenever the user selects a new one.p  pWhat is the simplest robust way to cache those images on the client side in the iOS app, yet always download the new one when they change on the server Id like to make Express check the file date inside the MongoDB document and compare that with the date on the client side possibly using ifmodifiedsince in the request header, and only return an image if theres a new one and Id like the client side to seamlessly cache the latest images on disk and in memory up to a reasonable usage of RAM.p  pPossibly outside the scope of this question, Id also like to generate and cache a grayscale version of the image on the client side. The phone can generate it easily enough so I dont want to store it on the server.p  pPlaying with NSURLCache, I can get it to cache images, but once theyre cached the HTTP GET request always returns the cached version  unless I use another NSURLSession that doesnt have a cache NSURLSession.sharedSession, in which case it always fetches the file from the server.p  pIf I set ifmodifiedsince in the request header to the date the file was saved on the server ISO 8601 date string, the Express server always returns 304 even though it hits my code which tells it to return status 200. Im assuming this is because it has no way to know the date associated with the resource its being asked for, and is possibly using some default date. p  pShould I be using some other middleware Im using express.staticp  precodevar express  requireexpress var app  express var bodyParser  requirebodyparser var ApiRouting  require.routesapirouting.js  app.useexpress.staticpath.joindirname, public app.usemyserverapi, jsonParser, apirouting.router  codepre

Negative 816 pWhat is happening here Whenever I press the start button, it simply starts counting from 0000000 on my JLabel nice, thats what I want. After pressing the stop button say on 0010000, I see my JLabel on 0010000 nice, thats what I want to. Okay here comes the problem, whenever I press the start button again, I expect it to start at 0010000. But it doesnt, because the counter keeps running on the background. So say my JLabel stands on 0010000 and wait for exactly 0007000 and press the start button again, it starts counting again from 0017000.

Possible causes include conditional compilation or compiler optimizations. is the message I get when I hover over the breakpoints which arent being hit.  I am in debug mode, and I know for a fact that it IS executing the code presented here, or at least a copy of it, as this code is in the middle of a series of cryptographic hash functions and the correct output is being produced from the given input.p  pRecently Id also been having a similar problem that I could work around with a bit of annoyance, which was that when I hit build, it would build and display warnings and errors correctly, but wouldnt actually execute any changes in code unless I did a full rebuild.

Negative 816 pI am writing a small simulation program where I have a codevoid moveint ncode function and a codevoid movecode function. As their names suggest, codemoveint ncode makes codencode moves at a time whereas codemovecode only makes one move. p  pNow I have two ways of implementing them on mind. Approach 1 isp  precodepublic void move     make one move   public void moveint n    for int i0iltni        move     codepre  pAnd approach 2p  precodepublic void moveint n    for int i0iltni         make one move      public void move    move1  codepre  pApparently when the number of moves is large, approach 2 gives time efficiency advantage as we do not make a separate functional call every time we make a move. However, since now the implementation of each move is implemented in a codefor loopcode, changing the implementation later on e.g. fetching metadata or analytical data from each move seems not to have good modularity.

Negative 816 pAn algorithm that I am working with spends a huge portion of the time comparing one array with a row of a matrix. If any emithem element is the same, the algorithm calls a procedure A, if no elements are equal, procedure B is invoked instead. For examplep  pcode[1, 4, 10, 3, 5]code and code[5, 3, 0, 3, 0]code calls codeAcode because for the 4th position, the value is 3 in both arrays.p  pcode[1, 4, 10, 3, 5]code and code[5, 3, 0, 1, 0]code calls codeBcode because for the same position, the values are never the same.p  pNote that 1 the arrays and matrix rows have always the same size N, and 2 the algorithm calls codeAcode strongwhen at least onestrong value matches.p  pThe simplest but very nave way of doing this in C is withp  precodeforint i0 iltN i    if A[i]  B[i]        flag  1       break     codepre  pThis is still very inefficient.

Negative 816 pI wrote a small chrome extension intended for my personal using. Up until now, Ive been able to load that unpacked into the dev channel of chrome without the dev mode warning of the stablebeta channels. However, this feature will be removed a hrefhttpblog.chromium.org201505continuingtoprotectchromeusersfrom.html relnofollowsoona and Im looking for ways to continue using this custom extension. According to the support page, its possible via group policy, but Ive been unable to do that since the extension lives locally on my hard drive and the codeExtensionInstallForcelistcode in the policy requires an update url. I know I can pay the 5 reg fee  and publish the extension privately, but I do not want to pay for an extension that only I am using. Is there a way to load extension not from the chrome store into chrome, where the extension is only available locally on the hard drive Simply loading it unpacked will give a dev mode warning every time chrome starts and thats annoying.p

Negative 816 pOur application uses Google Fused location API to receive location updates every 3 minutes.  The location request settings are as follows  p  ul liInterval  code3mincode li liFastest interval  code1 mincodeli liPriority  codePRIORITYBALANCEDPOWERACCURACYcodeli ul  pIn a normal running scenario, the location updates are received properly and the location accuracy is pretty good around 2025 m.p  pWhen the Maps application is opened, it received GPS location, and therefore our application also starts receiving location updates, which are basically from the GPS transceiver I know this as the subsequent location updates have a speed and altitude value as well.  p  pProblem occurs when the Maps application is now closed. Our application receives location updates, but the location coordinates do not change and every subsequent update received has a higher accuracy value. The updates may go up to even 1000m of accuracy and no accurate location are received. Opening the maps application again will make our application receive accurate and updated locations once again.p  pThis problem can also be device specific as I saw this problem on a Motorola Moto G and not on my other Samsung or Karbonn phones. p

If I put 2 links into application it wont show on the other webpages, the only way I could see the links is because I manually inserted the code into the individual webpage.

I like the approach with the static codeMyMessageBoxcode I can initialize once and that its globally available in the application. This is mainly for easy usage I guess cause I can simply call codeMyMessageBox.Show...code instead of injecting this all the way down to the smallest element. I have a similar opinion about the codeLocalizercode and codeExceptionHandlercode because these will be used even more.p  pA last concern I have is the following. Lets say I have a class with several arguments and one of the arguments is the codeLocalizercode because this will be used in nearly any class. Having to add codeILocalizer localizercode every time p  precodevar myClass  new MyClass..., ILocalizer localizer codepre  pfeels very annoying. This would push me towards a static Localizer I initialize once and having never to care about it anymore. How would this problem be tackledp

Negative 816 pNot sure if this is the right title for my problem, but here it goes I am currently implementing a Distributed Hash Table DHT with an API which can be contacted through TCP. It can serve multiple API calls like PUT, GET, Trace, while listening on multiple IPPort combinations like thisp  precodefactory  protocol.ServerFactory factory.protocol  DHTServer for ip in interfaces     for port in ports         reactor.listenTCPintport, factory, interfaceip         print Listening to  ip  on Port port reactor.run  codepre  pNow those external API calls are going to be executed by the underlying DHT implementation Kademlia, Chord or Pastry. Those underlying DHT implementations are using different protocols to communicate with one another. Kademlia for example uses RPC through UDP. p  pThe protocol for the TCP API DHTServer in the Code above has an internal DHT protocol like thisp  precodeself.protocol  Kademlia8088, [192.168.2.1, 8088] codepre  pNow if a client makes two seperate API requests after one another i get this error message on the second requestp  precodeline 197, in bindSocket raise error.CannotListenErrorself.interface, self.port, le     twisted.internet.error.CannotListenError Couldnt listen on any8088 [Errno 10     048] Normalerweise darf jede Socketadresse Protokoll, Netzwerkadresse oder Ansc     hluss nur jeweils einmal verwendet werden. codepre  pWhich basically says that each socket address is only to be used once. I am not quite sure, but i guess it is because for each API request a new codeDHTServercode protocol instance is created, which in turn also creates a new codeKademliacode instance and both are trying to listen on the same address. But why is this the case Shouldnt the first codeDHTServercode protocol instance be destroyed after the first request is served What am i doing wrong Is there a better way of doing this I only recently started working with twisted, so please be patient. Thanks a lotp

Negative 816 pI am new to this, but Ive researched it a bit. Ive seen other answers here that indicate I can share a cert between IIS and Apache, but I cannot figure out how to do so. I have added an internal Apache based web server to an existing IIS server.  Everything worked fine when using port 8080 for the new server, but when I try to go to HTTPS and 8443, it fails and I have become very confused. IIS mgr already shows certs and I dont know if I should attempt to export one of those or try to work with a new self signed one created with Keytool.  Neither seems to work.  I can connect, but but the client browser complains that  the server is untrusted. I am wanting to eventually configure this new app for SSO since all users would be internal.  Do I have to pay for a trusted root cert just for internal stuff   It seems like I should be able to use the existing certs the IIS server sees...p  pAny help would be appreciatedp

Negative 816 pI have two C programs built in Ubuntu, and I want to run them concurrently. I do not want to combine them into one C project and run each on a different thread, as this is causing me all sorts of problems.p  pThe solution I effectively want to emulate, is when I open two tabs in the terminal, and run each program in a separate tab. However, I also want one program lets call this Program A to be able to quit and rerun the other program Program B. This cannot be achieved just in the terminal.p  pSo what I want to do is to write some C code in Program A, which can run and quit Program B at any point. Both programs must run concurrently, so that Program A doesnt have to wait until Program B returns before continuing on with Program A.p  pAny ideas Thanksp

Negative 816 pI am interested in learning more about MVVM. I have taken a look at the MVVM Demo App. I understand many of the major concepts behind it.p  pWhen I began playing with the app, I wanted to open one of the tabviews by default upon the app starting up. However I am unsure on how to do that. p  pIn the app, I think I understand that when a control panel button is clicked e.g. View All Customers, the commandrelay creates a new AllCustomersViewModel and the data template applies the view to the viewmodel, the new workspace is created to the Workspaces collection and the tab opens because of the databinding in the main window.p  pI have no idea how to start this process other than clicking the hyperlink. I know that I need to call codenew RelayCommandparam gt this.ShowAllCustomerscode but I dont understand how to call this without any user interaction, or how to call it from outside of the mainwindowviewmodel, e.g. from the apps onstartup method.p  pCan someone please advise on the best way to use a relaycommand on the start up of an app Also, how do I use a relaycommand if the method I want to pass is within another classp  hr  pVMaleev has correctly given me a method to call the command, however the example provided was specific to a the collection of commands.

Negative 816 pIs it possible to specify the century natively with codelubridatecodep  pI ask because I have a long list of dates in the form ddmmyy from present day until 1890. When I use codelubridatedmycode, lubridate does a good job of recent dates, but when it gets to dates in 1999, it starts translating 99, 98, 97, etc. into 2099, 2098, 2097, etc.p  pI understand that I can perform some string operations to add in the missing 20 and 19 and 18s, but I am just wondering if something can be done natively.p
