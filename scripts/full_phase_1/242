Positive 242 pIm having this problem when the response from an endpoint is a JSON array.p  pRestkit automatically detects its an Array and maps the ObjectMapping to an Array of ObjettMappings, but this occurs JUST THE FIRST time after the installation of the app. After the first request, and mapping, the array mapped by restkit arrives with the correct order.p  pIv tried using codemetadata.mapping.collectionIndexcode aproach, but it also comes with an inverted order, so it isnt useful. I cant map to an NSOrderedSet because Restkit automatically detects its an array and maps the codeRKMappingResponsecode to an array.p

Positive 242 pEDIT my question after several tries. After being authenticated FilterChainProxy behaves adding wrong url I did not request instead of the ones I actually requested. My case I request publicsomething, it adds privatesomethingelse. I strongly believe my problem is due to a lack of theory about how actually Spring its servlet maps urls against each controller. I have the authentication against db through a custom authentication provider working. Then I have set a default success url which is requested at classlevel from UserHomeController with RequestMapping. After the controller returned that page I am just stuck on there, all the links from that page where I have been redirected after login arent added into FiletrChainProxy, on click it adds to the chain the path returned by the controller.

I also cant see this Mapper class being reused on any other Presentation Layer, since other views can be different from the Web presentation. To me it feels as a part of the Controller.p  pThe question is, is this correct Do I need to receive the Mapper through dependency injection Do I need to define an interface for it And if so, for what reasons I want to adhere to SOLID principles, but I want to know if and how they apply here.p

Positive 242 pI am trying to setup IIS Client Certificate Mapping Authentication and so far I have been unsuccessful. p  ol liI have a valid client authentication certificate li liI disabled all authentication methods in the Authentication feature of IIS for the target websiteli liUsing the configuration editor I setup iisClientCertificateMappingAuthentication as documented in various sources. In this series of screen we map a domain account to a certificate.

Negative 242 pRecently Ive been experimenting with TDD while developing a GUI application in Python. I find it very reassuring to have tests that verify the functionality of my code, but its been tricky to follow some of the recommened practices of TDD. Namely, writing tests first has been hard. And Im finding it difficult to make my tests readable due to extensive use of a mocking library.p  pI chose a mocking library called a hrefhttplabix.orgmocker relnofollowmockera. I use it a lot since much of the code Im testing makes calls to a other methods in my application that depend on system state or b ObjCCocoa objects that cannot exist without an event loop, etc.p  pAnyway, Ive got a lot of tests that look like thisp  precodedef testcurrentwindowcontroller     def testconfig         ac  AppController         m  Mocker         ac.iterwindowcontrollers  iwc  m.replaceac.iterwindowcontrollers         expectiwc.resultiterconfig         with m             result  ac.currentwindowcontroller             assert result  config[0] if config else None     yield test, []     yield test, [0]     yield test, [1, 0] codepre  pNotice that this is actually three tests all use the same parameterized test function. Heres the code that is being testedp  precodedef currentwindowcontrollerself     try          iterwindowcontrollers iterates in zorder starting          with the controller of the topmost window          assumption the topmost window is the current one         wc  self.iterwindowcontrollers.next     except StopIteration         return None     return wc codepre  pOne of the things Ive noticed with using mocker is that its easier to write the application code first and then go back and write the tests second, since most of the time Im mocking many method calls and the syntax to write the mocked calls is much more verbose thus harder to write than the application code. Its easier to write the app code and then model the test code off of that.p  pI find that with this testing method and a bit of discipline I can easily write code with 100 test coverage.p  pIm wondering if these tests are good tests Will I regret doing it this way down the road when I finally discover the secret to writing good testsp  pAm I violating the core principles of TDD so much that my testing is in vainp

Negative 242 pMost of the time, the errors you get from your model properties will happen when youre saving data. For instance, if you try saving a string as an IntegerProperty, that will result in an error.p  pThe one exception no pun intended is ReferenceProperty. If you have lots of references and youre not completely careful about leaving in bad references, its common to be greeted with an error like TemplateSyntaxError Caught an exception while rendering ReferenceProperty failed to be resolved.p  pAnd this is if theres only one bad reference in the view. Doh. p  pI could write a tryexcept block to try to access all the reference properties and delete them if an exception is raised, but this functionality could surely be useful to many other developers if there was a more generic method than the one Id be capable of writing. I imagine it would take a list of model types and try to access each reference property of each entity in each model, setting the property to None if an exception is raised.p  pIll see if I can do this myself, but it would definitely help to have some suggestionssnippets to get me started.p

That practically breaks this idea.p  pQuestion is there any way to retrieve the CSS text exactly as defined in the stylesheet Or is there another way to accomplish this via Javascript Id like to maintain clean CSS files without the need for defining each attribute multiple times for each specific browser.p

Negative 242 pI am trying to write a bag of features system image recognition system. One step in the algorithm is to take a larger number of small image patches say 7x7 or 11x11 pixels and try to cluster them into groups that look similar.

I have used KMeans for 2D and 3D clustering before but 49D clustering seems to be a different beast. p  pI keep getting garbage values for the returned clusters vector, so obviously this is a garbage in  garbage out type problem.

Negative 242 pIs there a way, when creating a WinForms Custom ControlUser Control, to get a reference at runtime to the form the control is placed on, so as to access various properties of that form I would rather not pass a reference to the form into the constructor of the control, as, for various reasons, I need to keep a default constructor with no parameters.p  pOne example I have several Custom Controls that encapsulate Win32 API calls, and some of the calls require Window handles to be passed as parameters. I would like to be able to retrieve the handle of the containing form so I can pass it to the API function.p  pAnother example I have a Custom Control that provides toaststyle user notifications. I would like to have the option of opening the notification form in a location relative to the location of the main application form, such as centered on the main window, off to the right, etc. This is not possible, obviously, without knowing the coordinates of the main applications window.p  pI emcouldem resort to using FindWindowExtype API calls in some cases, but that feels like a kludge, and would not work in all cases.p  pDoes anyone know if this is possiblep

Negative 242 pI have a multithreaded script which occasionally freezes when it connects to a server but the server doesnt send anything back. Netstat shows a connected tcp socket.

Negative 242 pI am building a web application with a services layer.  The services layer is going to be built using a RESTful design.  The thinking is that some time in the future we may build other applications iPhone, Android, etc. that use the same services layer as the web application.  My question is this  how do I implement login  I think I am having trouble moving from a more traditional verb based design to a resource based design.  If I was building this with SOAP I would probably have a method called Login.  In REST I should have a resource.  I am having difficulty understanding how I should construct my URI for a login.  Should it be something like thisp  pa hrefhttpmyservicehttpmyserviceausernameppasswordp  pEDIT The front end web application uses the traditional ASP.NET framework for authentication.  However at some point in the authentication process I need to validate the supplied credentials. In a traditional web application I would do a database lookup. But in this scenario I am calling a service instead of doing a database lookup.  So I need something in the service that will validate the supplied credentials.  And in addition to validating the supplied credentials I probably also need some sort of information about the user after they have successfully authenticated  things like their full name, their ID, etc.  I hope this makes the question clearer.p  pOr am I not thinking about this the right way  I feel like I am having difficulty describing my question correctly.p  pCoreyp

Negative 242 pIm working on a project which uses a tool developed inhouse.  Its convenient to have that tools source code available while working on my project, so I ran p  presvn propset svnexternals F svn.externals .pre  pwhere the svn.externals file containedp  preSourceOfToolForReference httpintranetsvntoolpre  pin a folder dedicated to my personal notes about the tool.p  pUnfortunately, this causes lots of information about emtoolem and the multitudinous externals defined by it, externals defined in its branches and tags, externals defined in the externals defined in each of its branches and tags, and so on and so forth to be included in codesvn statuscode and codesvn updatecode reports.  Doing some more reading, I tried to set a revision number for the reference code.  It would be nice to have the code be current, but removing the 293 lines that codesvn updatecode spits out and the 138 lines that codesvn statuscode spits out was a higher priority, and I would be wellenough served by periodically modifying the revision number. I therefore modified svn.externals to readp  preSourceOfProjForReference r40000 httpintranetsvnprojpre  pin hopes that it would subsequently ignore the contents of this folder, but this didnt appear to help.  p  pIt would take away about 50 of the lines if I were able to remove the branches in codeSourceOfToolForReferenceSoftwarebranchescode.p  pUsing the codeignoreexternalscode flag does solve the problem, but Id like to not have to type this every time I run a status or property check.  OK, I could use an alias, but then anyone else who wanted to work on my project would need the same alias, and a lot of them use TortiseSVN which requires some additional clicks to get this flag set.   I could export all 1.1GB of code in emtoolem, and then import that to my project, but that seems like a huge waste of space.  I could try to set the revision flag recursively, but I dont want to make changes to emtoolem if this is the only reason. p  pHow can I make Subversion ignore externals for future updates and status reportsp  pEdit Giving this a bump...if no one answers in the next 24 hours, Im just going to have to put the reference code in a different checkout directory.  Not all bad, but this is just the kind of thing that I imagined externals would be great at.p

This behavior does not occur when using AddRange, but the elements are expensive, so I add them one at a time using Dispatcher.Invoke in order to keep the UI responsive.p  pEDIT2 Because its been suggested three times, the reason I do not use a VirtualizingStackPanel is because it virtualizes too hard. I find it performing more work than a regular stack panel, because using my method, all items are created once, and the UI is responsive. With the virtualizing panel, the app locks up when new items are scrolled into view as it pauses to create a few more. Furthermore, there are issues with items that arent loaded not receiving events properly, and if one scrolls too far, earlier items appear to be discarded and are forced to be created later.  So I use a stack panel, where I avoid all of these issues, except for the initial load time, which Ive almost managed to overcome save this one question.p

The subform recordsource is a parameter query opened via querydef.OpenRecordset, in dbOpenDynaset mode.p  pUsing MS Access 2003, Access 2000 file format for frontend and backend, both FE and BE have recordlevel locking selected, all forms have No Locks for RecordLocks. p  pGoogling, it seems many people have had similar situations but no solutions found.p  pAny ideas  It seems like pagelevel locking is being used instead of recordlevel, when the insert is done on the form.p  ol lipCould it be that the backend connection via DAO OpenDatabase reverts to pagelevel locking  Any setting in the DAO connectionstring that could be helpful if sopli lipCould it be that by opening the recordset via querydef, it uses pagelevel locking, so that a simultaneous recordupdate and recordinsert recordset.AddNew or whatever may conflict  Microsofts article a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa18963328voffice.1029.aspx relnofollowherea suggests this might be the case although its unclear, as OpenRecordset is supposed to be OKpli ol  blockquote However, any SQL Data Manipulation Language DML queries  that is, queries that add, delete, or modify records  that are run from ADO when you use the Microsoft Jet 4.0 OLE DB Provider, DAO, or the Access query user interface will use pagelevel locking. Pagelevel locking is used for SQL DML statements to improve performance when you are working with many records. However, even when recordlevel locking is turned on, it is not used for updates to values in memo fields and values in fields that are indexed  they still require pagelevel locking. blockquote

Negative 242 pI would like to implement following scenario p  pExtender uses his extensions while extensions are grouped by theirs type. For example Extender  Vendor and Extensions  HotDogSeller1, HotDogSeller2, PopcornSeller. My point is that client customer want to buy either HotDogs or Popcorns however he will choose less loaded HotDogSeller smaller queue.p  pI am new to OSGi so I would like ask what are best practices to implement this I suppose I could use Apache Felix with iPojo and its a hrefhttpfelix.apache.orgsiteextenderpatternhandler.html relnofollowextender patterna. There are 2 problems with thisbr  liSame bundle has to be installed twice the hotdog implementation, each has its own queue length li liSomehow group the bundles that are of the same type hotdogs, popcorns. This could be done by creating property for bundle with some key like number to distinct HotDogSeller1 and HotDogSeller2lip

Negative 242 pI am trying to create an application that runs on windows. I want this application to download a disk image from the network from preassigned server and create a virtual machine based on it. This VM would run for a specified number of hours and then shutdown.p  pI want to use VirtualBox by scripting it. I found VBoxManage command and it seems to be what I am looking for. However, it seems that VirtualBox tools store their configuration as XML files in User home directory. I did learn that i can change the value of VBOXUSERHOME environment variable to control where they are stored. However, I am not sure whether this is enough.p  pMy problem is that the user may already have installed VirtualBox on hisher computer. I do not want my application code and its packaged VirtualBox binaries and conf to mess with the existing installation.p  pHow do I cleanly isolate my application specific VirtualBox binaries and configuration from the potentially preexisting installed VirtualBox setup Even if both instances of VirtualBox binaries are being used at the same timep  pI chose VirtualBox because of its open source license and applicability of commercial use if I compile my own binaries from the source and because it works on Windows too heard QEMU support for windows is still not stable. Will VirtualBox suffice for my usecase or should I look elsewherep  pThanks for reading so far p

Along the way I get some small problems mostly because there are certain parts of the code Im not getting completely.p  pHow I did it was to bind the ModalDialogManager to a MainWindow property of the Type IDialogViewModel. I then have a WindowsManager class that handles putting the right instance inside this property. One such is EditDialogViewModel that exposes a EditableViewModel to this DialogManager. I set the EditDialog view as a DataTemplate for this EditDialogViewModel but when I show it the new window only shows a part of it.p  pHere is the Viewp  precodeltUserControl.Resourcesgt      ltResourceDictionarygt         ltResourceDictionary.MergedDictionariesgt              ltResourceDictionary SourceEditDataTemplates.xaml gt          ltResourceDictionary.MergedDictionariesgt     ltResourceDictionarygt  ltUserControl.Resourcesgt     ltGridgt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt             ltRowDefinition Height7 gt             ltRowDefinition Height2 gt             ltRowDefinition Height1 gt         ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt          ltContentControl ContentBinding PathViewModel gt          ltTextBlock TextBinding PathViewModel.Error gt          ltUniformGrid Grid.Row2 Columns2gt              ltButton CommandBinding SaveCommand gt              ltButton CommandBinding CancelCommand gt          ltUniformGridgt      ltGridgt ltUserControlgt codepre  pBut the new Dialog window only shows the ContentControl bound to the ViewModel property of EditDialogViewModel it holds the ViewModel being edited.p  pMy guess is it has something to do with this code in the ModelDialogManagerp  precode void Show              if window  null Close          Window w  new Window         window  w         w.Closing  wClosing         w.Owner  GetParentWindowthis          w.DataContext  this.DataContext         w.SetBindingWindow.ContentProperty,  This code here does something I dont fully understand          w.Title  Title         w.Icon  Icon         w.Height  DialogHeight         w.Width  DialogWidth         w.ResizeMode  DialogResizeMode         w.ShowDialog      codepre  pHe is applying the binding there but I guess its only the first ContentControl that gets bound or something.

I can tab into the textboxes but not click into them.p  pIs there a way to fix this or a better method to handle Modal Dialog boxes in WPFp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOk Im going to admit it. Im a huge idiot. This was so simple I just couldnt see it. I had set Height and Width on the UserControl to a fixed value while I was still messing around with it being a Window.

I did as followsp  precodeload net.mat load Features.mat this is the test images features file testInputs  featuresset out  simnet,testInputs  [dummy, I]maxout if I  1     h  msgboxtype 1,Description,none elseif I  2     h  msgboxtype 2,Description,none else     h  msgboxunclassified,Description,none end codepre  pProblem is, even when I input another image, say a face of a person, it says either type 1 or type 2. It doesnt display unclassified. Always, gives either type 1 or type 2 for any image, not only for coin images.p  pCan someone please help mep
Negative 242 pI have a python program that uses ctypes to call a dll function to which I pass a pointer. It is supposed to write data continuously to that pointer and I want my program to loop and read the pointers contents. A rough template would look likep  precodefrom ctypes import  import copy lib  cdll.lib pointer  ccharp 100 however large a buffer I need thread this lib.dostuffpointer end thread while True     data  pointer.value     print data codepre  pdostuff, in my specific case, is written in C and opens a file and decodes it, running the data as a stream into a character array.p  pThe problem is that I cant use the regular threading module in python since the thread holds the GIL either since reading the dll is considered file IO or because the dll itself does file I0. Therefore, the loop does not run until dostuff is complete. What is the reason it blocks will dll calls always block and how can I get around thisp  pEDIT SOLVED As samplebias points out below, ctypes releases the GILlock. I discovered that the blocking issue in my program was that I was running a queue The code looked a bit like thisp  precodeimport Queue from threading import Thread  queue  Queue  def runthread      lib.dostuffpointer      while True         queue.putpointer.value  thread  Threadtargetrunthread thread.start while True     data  queue.get     dostuffwithdatadata codepre  pThe program was blocking because queue.get blocks when the queue is empty, until something goes inside Of course, since I didnt thread the dll call alone, it finished before I pushed the pointers results to the queue. The solution looks a bit like thisp  precodeimport Queue from threading import Thread  queue  Queue  def runthread      q  Threadtargetlib.dostuff, argspointer,      q.start      while True          queue.putpointer.value  thread  Threadtargetrunthread thread.start while True    data  queue.get    dostuffwithdatadata codepre  pI hope this helps someonep

Negative 242 pI have an ATL COM service which I can connect to via my Windows Forms Application .NET4 application, written for the most part in managed c.p  pI can successfully retrieve a pointer to the interface via CoCreateInstance, but run into issues when attempting to implement an event sink. I wish to create an unmanaged c class in the application which implements an interface defined by the COM server, and receive events from the ConnectionPoint. What Ive got so farp  ul liRealising this isnt possible using a managed ref class c class, Im using a normal unmanaged class.li liNot being able to use any ATL macros, I need to implement the IUnknown abstract functions AddRef, Release, QueryInterface etc in the sink class.li ul  pI can retrieve the IConnectionPoint pointer for the interface, but the call to Advise returns ENOTIMPL. This leads me to believe that ive missed implementing some ATL base functionality somewhere, but Im not sure where to start.p  pAs an aside, ive found very little resources on the net about using COM in a managed c project. The closest ive come to is a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinecc163361.aspx relnofollowthisa article. Does anybody have any good reading on this subject Its mangling my brain at the moment.p

Negative 242 pIm working with some 3D graphics and I encountered a problem. I have models that move in a world. The models have a base class that contains their orientation in the form of three orthogonal unit vectors namely bDirectionb, bUpb, and bRightb. They point to where the front of the model is directed, the up and the right directions respectively.p  pThe AI of a model pursues a target by changing the bDirectionb vector of the model and all other orientation vectors accordingly, so that it simulates that the model is pointing to the target.p  pI cannot keep track of the angles that the AI changes the orientation vectors by because the AI files were already precompiled and I cannot change them. Also, the AI changes the vectors using the position coordinates of the model and the position coordinates of the target.p  pMy question is how can I obtain byawb, bpitchb and brollb from the orientation vectors in order to create a rotation matrix to rotate the whole model in the desired orientationp  pThanks for any help.p  p[EDIT] Thanks to the given answer I found thisp  precode               X   Y   Z   W                                      Right  Rx  Ry  Rz  Rw            Up  Ux  Uy  Uz  Uw      Forward Fx Fy Fz Fw   Translation  Tx  Ty  Tz  Tw                                codepre  pThis is how the matrix should be set up to obtain the world matrix using the orientation vectors without scaling to scale, just create a scale matrix and multiply it by this.p  p[SOLVED]p

I am under the impression that if I move the declaration of Save to my ICormantControl interface then I will have to move the implementation of Save to each of the controls which implement ICormantControl. This would result in a large amount of duplicated code.p  pShould I be leaving my implementation in my helper class, moving the declaration to ICormantControl, and then, in each class which implements ICormantControl, I redirect the implementation to my helper methodp  pAs far as I can tell I am not able to have all of my controls inherit from an intermediary class. The common parent is too far up the hierarchy of inherited parent controls. It may be possible to extend WebControl and have it implement Save, but that seems orders of magnitude worse than my above suggestion.p  pDo I have other optionsp

Negative 242 pstrongUse casestrongp  pUser clicks a link, a modal window is displayed containing one big image, scaled down to fit this window. When the user scrolls their mousewheel up or down, the image zooms in or out. The image is zoomed at whatever location the mouse cursor is pointing.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pI cant wrap my brain around the howto part of doing this.p  pstrongCurrent workingsstrongp  pWhen a link is clicked, a jQuery plugin creates a viewer collection of html elements that are styled with CSS. Its an absolute positioned DIV that contains an IMGelement. The image is scaled to 100 width. When scrolling, the image is increased by 5 per scroll action.p  pBecause the image is scaled up whilst zooming in, the containing DIV overflow hidden will eventually clip the image. The image is draggable so that you can always see all parts of it.p  pstrongVariables I keep and knowstrongp  pThe images scaled down ratio. The images dimensions pre our most recent zoom action. The images new dimensions after our most recent zoom action. The difference in these two dimensions. The X and Y position of the image.

Negative 242 pIm working on an app for webOS that will take a megaupload linkassuming its a video, parse it into a direct link and stream it to a ffplay port for webos called TouchPlay. Im working on a basic prototype that will just take the end code on a megaupload link and return a direct link. Now that I have laid out the basic parts of my application, on to my question.

Negative 242 pIve tried a number of things and to post code at this point would likely be confusing, so let me start with the concept.p  pI need to somehow combine the operations of long press and touch drag into a single operation, something like LongPressThenDragGestureRecognizer.  Im trying to accomplish this on an MKMapView, so I cant just disable user interaction the entire time, because I want the pan and zoom functionality of the map. p  pTo complicate things a bit, the initial item an MKOverlay object that the user longpresses on to recognize interaction will need to be removed and replaced with a new drawn object.  At that point, the the code doesnt care about the object anymore, only where the finger is at any given point I will redraw the dragged object as they move.p  pThis is the workflowp  ol liUser is presented an overlay on the mapli liUser touches and holds on the item to let the app know they want to drag itli liThe app replaces the overlay with a drawn object and disables the map so that it doesnt start panning rather than dragging.li liUser drags finger, and object redraws as they move.li liUser lifts finger to complete the dragli liApp replaces the drawn object with a new map overlayli liApp enables user interaction on the map to allow panzoomannotation selection, etc.li ol  pIve tried a number of things so far, with little success.  The best results I have so far is listed below.  This was done using a UILongPressGestureRecognizer on the MKMapView objects checking intersection with overlay, and then overriding touchesBegan for map touch drag. p  ul liOverlay is shown and user successfully performs a longpress gesture that gets recognized appropriatelyli liMap user interaction is disabled and overlay is replaced with drawn objectli listrongUser has to lift finger and touch down again to initiate the drag operationstrongli liWhen user lifts finger, new overlay is drawn and map interaction is enabled againli ul  pIm so close, I just dont know how to combine the gestures into one, so that the user doesnt have to lift hisher finger and touch down again to start the drag.p  pAny ideas are greatly appreciated.p
Negative 242 pI know this is a fairly popular topic around here, but Im hoping someone can help me with my particular implementation. Im working on a design that uses jQuery animations to create an accordion menu, and it works, but I get a lot of jitter during the animation. p  pFrom my searching, the solution for this seems to be to animate all of the elements with one codeanimatecode object and a codestepcode function to ensure synchronization. The problem is, I cant for the life of me, come up with a codestepcode function that works. p  pHere is my latest attempt a hrefhttpwww.3strandsmarketing.comjqtestv2.html relnofollowhttpwww.3strandsmarketing.comjqtestv2.htmlap  pIt works if you move your mouse slowly, but the code is kludgy to say the least, and if you move your mouse quickly it totally falls apart btw, Ive tried mitigating this with the hoverIntent plugin, but I didnt like the lag it added.p  pI think the answer maybe in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5345160jqueryaccordionjitterissueJQuery Accordion Jitter Issuea or a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2056685jitterinjqueryaccordionimplementationJitter in Jquery Accordion Implementationa, but I lack the skill to adapt their code to my situation.p  pAlso I really want to avoid the extra weight of adding jQuery UI if at all possible.

Negative 242 pI have a PHP script that we run every few minutes through a cron entry, and every now and then about once a week instead of ending normally, it stays running, eating up 100 of a CPU core im assuming, looping infinitelyp  pLooking at the code and thinking about it, I cant find any reason for this to happen, but it does. So far, when I get 3 or more of those I kill them, and that solves the CPU issue, but Id like to do something about this...p  pIs there any way to dump a process, or attach to it with a debugger so that I can know emsomethingem, emanythingem about what its doing Just which PHP line its on would be of huge help. I dont mind if the process dies when I dump, or anything.p  pThis is a PHP script, running from the command line, in a CentOS 5.6 machine, and Im a big noob when it comes to nix, so if you can point me to some tutorial for dummies thatd be awesome.p  pThank you Danielp

Negative 242 pI have n points in R3 that I want to cover with k ellipsoids or cylinders I dont really care whichever is easier.  I want to approximately minimize the union of the volumes.  Lets say n is tens of thousands and k is a handful.  Development time i.e. simplicity is more important than runtime.p  pObviously I can run kmeans and use perfect balls for my ellipsoids.  Or I can run kmeans, then use minimum enclosing ellipsoids per cluster rather than covering with balls, though in the worst case thats no better.  Ive seen talk of handling anisotropy with kmeans but the links I saw seemed to think I had a tensor in hand I dont, I just know the data will be a union of ellipsoids.  Any suggestionsp  p[Edit Theres a couple votes for fitting a mixture of multivariate Gaussians, which seems like a viable thing to try.  Firing up an EM code to do that wont minimize the volume of the union, but of course kmeans doesnt minimize volume either.]p

Negative 242 pI am relatively new to parallel programming and want to accomplish the following task in c by openmp.p  pI have some lets say 4 relative complex objectscalculations to do. All of them are similar, but too complex to parallelize each of them so they run serial. So my idea was to use a different threadcpu for each of them, meaning I want to to spread the calculations over my cores. Though this might not be the most efficient usage of parallelism in this context, it might be the easiest to achieve because of the high complexity of each calculation.p  pWhile this would work byp  precodepragma omp parallel      pragma omp for     forint i  0 i lt 4 i             obj[i].calculate           codepre  pI want to exchange further information between this objects, for example an integer or a more complex object a should be modified during each calculation though I can not forecast when and how often, but especially mostly more then once. If it is modified, the information needs to be incorporated into each other calculation as well. While the specific exchange of the information is again relatively complex, this is done by the calculate methods implicitly as well. In general this should look like above, with the additional integer a, which is written on and read from by all the calculation methodsp  precodeint a pragma omp parallel     pragma omp for    forint i  0 i lt 4 i            obj[i].calculate          codepre  pSo my question is, how can i prevent a data race on a Meaning how can I generate an object, which may only be accessed by one thread at each time without going into details with in the calculation methods themselves Does openmp offer this functionality, and if not, which library doesp  pBest regards and thanks in advancep

Negative 242 pUsing Woodwing, we have a page that has custom html in it, using the custom web widget.p  pThat widget has an anchor tag, that when tapped, opens a page in safari.p  pHowever, if we create the same page using the HTML widget, and a link overlay, that triggers a ModalView to display.p  pIm assuming this has something to do with WoodWings undocumented protocols for the anchor tags, that are captured by the WoodWing shell application and used to trigger the ModalView display. Since everything in Woodwing generates an XML that is parsed when the app is loaded, and Ive done numerous applications, this seems reasonable. However, there is very little technical documentation. p  pMy question is does anyone know any documentation on those protocols, or a way I can use customhtml to trigger the ModalView Ive tried replacing http with ww but no dice. Its possible its javascript but Im suspecting protocols...p

Negative 242 pIn Go, public names start with an upper case letter and private names start with a lower case letter.p  pIm writing a program that is not library and is a single package. Is there any Go idiom that stipulates whether my identifiers should be all public or all private I do not plan on using this package as a library or as something that should be imported from another Go program.p  pI cant think of any reason why Id want a mixture. It feels like going all private is the proper choice.p  hr  pI dont think I got any concrete answer, but Nate was closest with telling me to think of exporting vs nonexporting instead of public and private.p  pThis leads me to believe that not exporting anything is the best approach. In the worst case scenario, if I end up importing code from my application in another package, I will have to rethink what should be exported and what shouldnt be. Which is a good thing IMO.p

Negative 242 pIm using ajax to improve user experience in my Django project. My concern here is how to respond error to browser properly.

If something bad happens, the uncaught exception would cause an internal server error, which is still an error for the browserli ol  pFor me, the fisrt method seems more orthodox , as in Python the philosophy of Explicit is better than Implicit really counts. But since all sorts of exception checking are removed from the second one, it is cleaner, less fragmented and more readable.p  pIm using jQuery to handle ajax requestresponse and both methods seem working. My questions arep  ol liAre both methods acceptableli liWill the second method fail for other Javascript librariesli liWhat is the best practice for thisli ol  pPS. I do do essential data validation.

Negative 242 pIm working on an app that behaves like a photo gallery, and Im implementing the option to have the user delete photos from their gallery. To accomplish this, I decided to place an invisible button over each picture. When the user hits an Edit button, the hidden delete buttons over each picture become active. Im using the same IBOutlet over each of the hidden buttons for simplicity, and Ive tagged each button appropriately in Interface Builder. When the user taps the button over the picture, an alert view appears asking if they really want to delete it. If they click yes, I call removeObjectAtIndex. Here is the code Im usingp  precode IBActiondeleteButtonPressedidsender      NSLogSender is , sender     UIAlertView deleteAlertView  [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitleDelete                                                               messageAre you sure you want to delete this photo                                                              delegateself                                                     cancelButtonTitleNo                                                     otherButtonTitlesYes, nil]     [deleteAlertView show]     int imageIndex  UIButton sender.tag     deleteAlertView.tag  imageIndex     voidalertView UIAlertView  alertView  clickedButtonAtIndex NSInteger buttonIndex        if buttonIndex  [alertView cancelButtonIndex]          NSLogUser Clicked Yes.

This code deletes the image out of the array just fine, but I still need to delete the image from the UI as well. I thought that codealertView.tag.imagecode would have done the trick. I have no idea how to do this, Im still new to ObjectiveC and the book I read does not cover any of this at all. I was also wondering how I could refresh the UI after deleting the imagep

I tried a coderncode and codeEnvironment.NewLinecode after the second quotation mark to no avail.p  pThis is not really a language I understand, but I am hoping this is something very basic I need to enter.p  pThanks, Benp  hr  pSome additional information as per the responsesp  pMSGSUBJECT is a call to the db cell with that name. The value is plain text to dictate the subject line of the email it will generate. Both solutions here got the script to operate, but mistook the first sent the email with a subject of lt forms.FieldValueMSGSUBJECT, Container  and the second with lt forms.FieldValueMSGSUBJECT, Container  therefore not recognising it as referencing the db table cell, but as the variable itself. Normally within the code it would say rivate MSGSUBJECT As String  Your completed form is attached and the next variable would follow on the line below, i.e. address to be sent to, sent from. But really, there is little more to the code. The entire script is run serverside. While I could contain these variables within the posting form page and this would work, it is not a solution I want, as the script can also receive FDF data submitted from an acroform which has used the URL submit to facility, therefore in this mode these message variables must be included within the severside script. As you said, I really dont know myself whether this is even possible, it is just a punt as keeping the variables within a db is far easier to administrate and deploy new forms than having multiple versions of the script with hardcoded variables. Thanks for your assistance.p

Negative 242 pI need to choose between SQLite and MYSql. I am a little confused on what to choose. I know that both database engines have no recursive query mechanisms and SQLite doesnt support stored procedures.  This is my situation. I have an application which has around 1000 processes accessing the same database. The database has around 2 tables and around 10,000 entries in total. The application isnt distributed, I mean all processes are running on the same machine. I want to embed the database in the application itself. I think MYSql isnt a good idea keeping all these in mind. Also my application doesnt involve complex queries a couple of select, update and insert queries I know that SQLite is much lighter than MYSql but MYSql supports stored procedures and SQLite doesnt. I also need good locking mechanisms. I dont want a process to lock the table for a long time. Ive read that lockingunlocking operations are pretty fast in SQLite httpsqlite.orglockingv3.html.

Negative 242 pI am building a cookie based session mechanism which has an abstract class Session which can be extended to make multiple cookie session instances for varying use and complexity.p  pI also have an Auth class which handles permissions and the actual logging in and out of the user. The Auth class requires a Session Class or child class of to run.p  pEverything so far is great I can log a user in and also log them out if a certain amount of time has elapsed, ip address are not matching etc. p  pEvery page load reads the cookie checks for inconsistencies and destroys or updates it depending on xyz. The destroy scripts set the time on the cookie back to minus now and remove any user data that has been added from the auth library. This works as I have logged in waited a few minutes then hit refresh and the cookie gets frazzled and I get bounced back to the login screen.  p  pHowever If I want to log them out via them clicking a button the destroy scripts do not work i.e. I can echo the original user data at the top the run the log out script which echoes logging out and runs all the functions with no errors etc  but then If I get the users cookie it is still the same.

Negative 242 pI searched all over and did not find any answer to this.  Im using Django 1.4 and my problem is this Im trying to implement in contrib admin a tree like models structure.p  pLets say we have model A and model B that is a child of model A, in admin changelist grid of A when I click on an item I should redirect to model B changelist view and filter it with children of A.p  pIn previous version of Django I just rewrote the child models admin urls and added d. p  pEx add url . was changed to lt parentid d. so in change view I retrieved  the parent object and used it for all required filtering and also sent it in context to be displayed in breadcrumbs.p  pIt worked because in all admin templates then we had relative links for breadcrumbs, add, delete, history,..., so for example the Cancel button in confirm delete page had href.... and clicking on it would have taken me from appmodelparentidobjiddelete to appmodelparentidp  pDue to the changes in 1.4 where all template links are generated with reverse url I obviously get errors with NoReverseMatch. A temporary fix was to pass the parent id in session so that I can have it in all child admin pages I dont think that this is a good way to go for many reasons. p  pBottom line Im trying to rewrite the admin urls in a way that wont interfere with current templates so that I can send the parent id in the url sending it in the query string is also not an option Is there anyone out there that did something similarp

Negative 242 pIve come up against an issue here when wanting to use the async CTP keywords.  All developer machines are VS2010 and therefore require the async CTP to be installed  this has been done and code has been written using these features.  However, when I came to commit this code, I realised that our build server had VS2012 installed and hence .NET 4.5 as another team requires C11 features and share this resource.p  pThis means that the continuous build server fails our C builds since they are now targeting .NET 4.0 we still have WinXP user machines with async methods plus the CTP method of enabling these new keywords.  By installing the async targetting pack into these projects, I get other compilation errors Same class defined twice, once in CTP and once in the async targetting pack.p  pIs there anyway to have both of these methods play nicely together  Obviously we fully intend to either get all developers working on VS2012 shortly  not to mention get our users up and running with .NET 4.5 but this is beyond the scope of the question.p  pI have a solution which Ive answered below but would appreciate any feedback.p

Negative 242 pIn this app i have enabled the user the option to long click that brings up an alert. This alert then has 2 buttons that the user can choose from. The first allows the use to place a marker on the map at the location that was long clicked and the second gets the address of the location that was long clicked. The address button works but, the marker button force closes my app. Im not sure what im doing wrong. Its probably something stupid.p  pHere is the method from my main classp  precode Override public boolean dispatchTouchEventMotionEvent ev             We want to capture the place the user long pressed on the map and add       a marker pin on the map at that latlong.

if the pointer              count is greater than 1              next thing to look at is if the x and y coordinates of the              persons finger change.             startTimeForLongClick  0  instead of a timer, just reset                                          this class variable and in our                                          ACTIONUP event, the DownTime

Negative 242 pIve got a single codeOnDownloadProgresscode event handler for an ordered list of codeBitmapImagecode items that Im putting into a codeFlipViewcode, and Im wondering the best way to get the index of the sending BitmapImage in the event handler.p  pIts easy to do this kind of thing with objects derived from codeFrameworkElementcode, because they have a codeTagcode property that you can set to the index or whatever you want. But the OnDownloadProgress event is sent not by the codeImagecode, but by the BitmapImage, and that doesnt have a codeTagcode.p  pI can think of a couple of ways to achieve this, but they seem hackish or heavy.p  pOne way is by setting the Images codeTagcode to the BitmapImage instance, and then searching for that instance in the handler until youve found the senderp  precodeprivate FlipView PhotosView  private void AddImagesListltstringgt photoUrls      PhotosView.Items.Clear     foreach var url in photoUrls              var image  new Image         var source  new BitmapImagenew Uriurl         source.DownloadProgress  OnDownloadProgress         image.Source  source         image.Tag  source         PhotosView.Items.Addimage        private void OnDownloadProgressobject sender, DownloadProgressEventArgs args      int n  0     foreach var item in PhotosView.Items              var image  Imageitem         if image.Tag  sender                      Debug.WriteLineimage 0 progress1, n, args.Progress             break                  n       codepre  pBut that seems kinda wrong. A better way would be to maintain a mapping of BitmapImage instances to the index codeDictionaryltBitmapImage, intgtcode, and while more speedefficient, that seems kinda heavy too.p  pOr, finally, I could subclass codeBitmapImagecode and add a codeTagcode or codeIndexcode member. Oh wait ... its a codesealedcode class. Scratch that one.p  pIs there a simpler or more standardized way to do this kind of thingp

Negative 242 pIve been reading Java Puzzlers by Bloch and Gafter and got to the puzzle 10 Tweedledee. The essence of this puzzle is top  blockquote   pprovide declarations for the variables codexcode and codeicode such that this is a legal statementp  precodex  x  i codepre      pbut this is notp  precodex  i codepre blockquote  pThe solution to this looks, according to the book, like thisp  precodeObject x  Buy  String i  Effective Java codepre  pThe book claims that in the codecode operator the righthand expression can be of any type only if the lefthand expression has type codeStringcode. However, I tried to run this code, and it compiled and ran without any problems.p  pThen I dug into the Java Language Specification. Section 15.26.2 talks about two cases when the lefthand expression is an array access expression and when its not. If the lefthand operand expression is not an array access expression, then JLS doesnt say anything about the lefthand expression being a String. When it is, this part applliesp  blockquote   pIf T is a reference type, then it must be String. Because class String is a   final class, S must also be String. Therefore the runtime check that is   sometimes required for the simple assignment operator is never required for   a compound assignment operator.p      p The saved value of the array component and the value of the righthand   operand are used to perform the binary operation string concatenation   indicated by the compound assignment operator which is necessarily   . If this operation completes abruptly, then the assignment expression   completes abruptly for the same reason and no assignment occurs.p blockquote  pT here is the type of the lefthand operand as determined at compiletime, and S is the selected array component. So I thought that I would modify my code into thisp  precodeObject[] x  new Object String i  Effective Java x[0]  i codepre  pBut even this code compiles and runs without any problems even though codenew Objectcode is not even remotely a codeStringcode.p  pWhy is this happening Does this mean that Java compiler deviates from the JLS And is it still possible to somehow solve the original puzzlep

Negative 242 pI am working on complicated code generation using CodeModel available in Java. I have managed to setup my unit tests in such a way so that a test generates small but functionally complete Java code which gets compiled in memory and generated classes isare loaded from memory. Everything in general is reasonably quick if I dont output generated code.p  pSince the generator code is not aware of generated classes, I use reflection to fire methods on generated class which works well. These methods also can fail as I use reflection to make sure methods did expected work by checking state of the object.p  pMy problem is I dont want to log the generated code every time test is run. But I want to see the generated code if test fails. There are lot of tests and since I use infintest, my eclipse becomes slower as infinitest keeps accumulating the output from various tests.p  pCan I set up junit so that it calls my function if test fails e.g.p  precodeboolean compileSuccessful  compile Assert.assertTrueOoops, you generated bad code, compileSuccessful codepre  pIf above assertion fails, I want to ouput generated code and see what went wrong.p

Negative 242 pIm kind of new to the Android world.. but I have a few years of exp with webdev using .Net and C... and one feature I really enjoy there is the linqexpressions for quering for data.. is there anything that simulair for Android using to query against JSONs or against the SqlLite database I guess im looking for a typed expressionqueryframework.p  pAnd for my next question.. Which one of the JSON approach and the SQLLite approach am I supposed to use.. and when I know this has been asked a million times.. but there doesnt seem to be any strict answers..p  pIs SQLLite for more complex querying and when Im having a bigger ammount of data, while JSON is used while having a smaller ammount of data and not very much querying is neededp  pCould I store all my JSON data in the memmory for faster readwrite access..since I have heard that storing it in the storageon disk might be a slow process.p  pBut on the other hand I also have heard that SQLLite is slow in generall...p  pAnd finally.. when we are speaking of slow is it slow like, a single readwrite looks up the entire application for a few milisecs or is it slow like compared to a inmemorydatabase that executes queries and stuff fast as lightningp

Negative 242 pMy application requires me to create an XML document and send it to the user as an attachment. I would like to know if there is any way to create an XML document and send it as an attachment without saving the file to the server The reason I am asking this is that there will be many emails being sent and I dont want to overload the server with files. If there is no way to do this I realize that I could just save the file, send it in an email, and then delete the file. However it would be a lot easier if I could just create the file and send it without saving. I have seen this done with a PDF where you create the PDF using codeltcf documentgtcode and send it as a parameter using codeltcfmailparamgtcode, is there anything similar for XMLp

Negative 242 pIm trying to write a function which gets string as its argument, searches if there is p or e in it, splits it onto separate strings, replaces empem with em3.14...em and emeem with em2.71...em, converts all strings onto double and then multiplies all converted strings. For example, when argument is em123.45p4e9.2em, function splits it onto em123.45em, empem, em4em, emeem and em9.2em, then replaces characters with constants em123.45em, em3.14...em, em4em, em2.71...em and em9.2em, after that converts all of them onto double and multiplies 123.453.1442.719.2 .p  pThe problem is that when I give it a string with only a number, without any p or e for example em2.4em or em32em, it returns 0. However, when I give it emeem, empem, or emepem, it returns em2.71...em, em3.14...em or em8.53...em, so in that in this case it works well. The problem is back, when I try to give it string with combination of numbers and characters. When I enter em3pem, function returns correct result em9.42...em. On the other side, when I enter emp3em, it returns 3.14... although it should still be em9.42...em. It looks like it simply doesnt work with numbers and if there appears e or p, it doesnt seem to discover numbers after first character.p  pCould someone look on the code and find out, where the problem is Ive been trying to find it for hours, but on logical side everything seems to be OK.p  precodeinclude stdafx.h include ltiostreamgt include ltconio.hgt include ltstringgt include ltmath.hgt include ltwindows.hgt  define NULL       null  using namespace std  double stalestring w  int main  Testing the function  string liczba cout ltlt Type the number  cin gtgt liczba  double wynik  staleliczba  cout ltlt endl ltlt Result  ltlt wynik ltlt endl ltlt endl systemPAUSE     double stalestring w  string wartosc  new string[w.length]     Dynamic string array  forint i  0 i lt w.length i          String array is filled with null     wartosc[i]  NULL             Bracket only to control lifespawn of liczba and elementwartosc variables string liczba  NULL            Therell be built a number between e and p int elementwartosc  0  forint i  0 i lt w.length i          Searching argument string for e and p     switchw[i]     case p         ifliczba  NULL                   Ends generating number, which isnt e or p             wartosc[elementwartosc]  liczba             liczba  NULL             elementwartosc             wartosc[elementwartosc]  3.14159265358979323846             elementwartosc         else         wartosc[elementwartosc]  3.14159265358979323846         elementwartosc                  break     case e         ifliczba  NULL                   Ends generating number, which isnt e or p             wartosc[elementwartosc]  liczba             liczba  NULL             elementwartosc             wartosc[elementwartosc]  2.71828182845904523536             elementwartosc         else         wartosc[elementwartosc]  2.71828182845904523536         elementwartosc                  break     default         if liczba  NULL             liczba  w[i]                        Starts filling liczba variable with first character         else ifw[i]  0              wartosc[elementwartosc]  liczba    Ends generating number on argument string end             break         else             liczba  liczba  w[i]               Builds the number                   double wynik  0                              There will be the result  forint i  0 i lt w.length i     ifwartosc[i]  NULL                    wartosc array was filled earlier with null strings, to distinguish it from entered numbers         continue     else         double liczba  stodwartosc[i]      Converting strings onto doubles         ifwynik  0             wynik  liczba                    Starting multiplification         else             wynik  liczba                   Multiplification                 delete[] wartosc      Removing dynamic array return wynik          The result is returned  codepre

Negative 242 pI am creating the real time simulation of the rays passing throught the system of lenses and mirrors. The parts of the system can be moved by the user and the program calculates new rays.p  pI have already written a nice module that allows me to rapidly simulate the trajectory of the rays in any system configration. I was using the PILs ImageDraw module to draw a frame that represents the generated data and wxPython to show the frame and to allow the user interaction.p  pUnfortunately, the PIL and wxPython combination is very slow 10 fps .

Negative 242 pIts blowing my mind a little bit that OrderedDict in Python is not a sequence type. It has a concept of order, but its not a sequence.p  pThe a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2librarystdtypes.htmlsequencetypesstrunicodelisttuplebytearraybufferxrange relnofollowPython docsa say p  blockquote   pThere are seven sequence types strings, Unicode strings, lists,   tuples, bytearrays, buffers, and xrange objects.p      pFor other containers see the built in dict and set classes, and the   collections module. ...Most sequence types support the following   operations....Sequence types also support comparisons.p blockquote  pThose operations corresponding to codecontainscode, codeaddcode for concatenation, codegetitemcode with integers in coderangelenfoocode, codelencode, codemincode, codeslicecode, codeindexcode and codecountcode. codeltcode etc implement comparisons.p  pOrderedDicts implement some of these methods but not others, probably because the syntactic sugar for accessing items by key as in dict or order as in index is the same.p  pI know if something implements codeitercode I can loop through it. How can I definitely know if something has an order I would have thought that is what is meant by sequence, the nth item is always the nth item.p

Negative 242 pCommunity,p  pCould someone help me understand the basics of creating a website which calls MS Excel for datacalculationsp  pI have created a fairly robust Excel workbook which does thousands of calculations with the use of VBA macros. The ultimate goal is to be able to create a simple website for which users can visit to get results. p  p UPDATE p  pAs Ive learned, it is not possible to create a website which uses MS Excel as its calculations engine. Instead, one would need to build a standalone application which doesnt require MS Office. Basically, I have spent about 80 hours porting over a 300 hour Excel project onto a .NET desktop application. It was the best option for me. I researched amp tried Java, C, PHP, and other languages before I finally settled on .NET. p  pThe toughest part is just figuring out how to storeretrieveupdate the data necessary for your project. From there, transferring from VBA to .NET is fairly simple. The next steps for me will be to make a Web Application with the use of Visual Studio 2012 that mirrors my desktop application. And finally, Ill just build the website.

Negative 242 pIve been doing some research into this topic and havent found good concrete answers. Lets say you have these expression in your codep  precodeB  2  B  B  5  B  J  B  codepre  pThese are very simple examples, I know they arent realisticp  pcodeBcode has many different values throughout these lines. In line one its code2code, later on it becomes code7code, and more later on its code7  Jcode. A compiler would need to keep track of these different values for codeBcode, so one way is to rename them. For example, when codeBcode is redefined as codeB  B5code, it could be changed to codeB1  B5code. The last redefinition would then look like codeB2  JB1code.p  pThe motivation behind this idea involves an optimizing program Im building. It involves replacing variables with expressions that theyre related to. If a variable is redefined, however, then the character B can mean multiple things at once. The method Im using to keep track of things is what Ive described above, redefining variable names.p  pIs this at all how compilers work Is there a name for this p  pIm trying to find out as much as I can about this process of a compiler redefining variables in the case of redefining variables. p  pIf it helps, I believe this would be done at a preprocessing stage of compiling, and I believe its a similar concept to macroexpansion.p  pEDIT I added a little more context to the question.p

Negative 242 pI pretty much know why my iPad app is crashing, but Im having trouble coming up with a scheme to get around the scenario. The app is a jigsaw puzzle app. Ive got a working version thats more stable than the one in the app store, but I still have a pesky problem I cant quite lick.p  pThe root of the problem is a clash between user activity and automated saves. The save essentially stores the state of the puzzle as property list. The property list contains, among other things, a compilation of all the palettes in the puzzle, and for each palette, the details of all the pieces on that palette. It works well, except that user activity could change these details. A palette is essentially a UIView containing puzzle pieces as subviews. A user can move pieces around on a palette or move them from palette to palette.p  pI have the save process working in two phases. The first phase is kicked off by a timer. At regular intervals, this phase checks to see if there is some user activity that warrants a save. It sets a property codeabortSavecode to NO and then triggers a nonrepeating timer to wait for another period of time before starting phase two.p  pIn phase two, the save takes place as long as codeabortSavecode is NO.p  pMeanwhile, if the user performs any operation that affects the save, codeabortSavecode is set to YES. The idea is that the delay between phase 1 and phase 2 is longer than it takes to perform a user operation, so if codeabortSavecode is NO, then it should be safe to do a save.p  pThis process has eliminated 95 or so of the crashes, but Im still getting crashes.p  pOf course, for decent performance of the app, the user activity as well as the save operation take place in background threads.p  pThe type of circumstance I am running into is usually a mutation during fast enumeration, or something like that. Essentially, some user action is making a change during the save process. If I copy the object being fast enumerated and then work on the copy, it doesnt help. Sometimes the error will happen on the copy statement. If the object is an array, I dont use fast enumeration but use a regular for loop to work through the array. That helps a bit.p  pI hope this question isnt too generic. I suppose I could post some code, but Im not sure how helpful it really would be. And I dont want to needlessly clutter the question.p  pOne thing that I have not done yet, would be to use a flag working the other wayp  pcodesaveProcessActivecode set to YES right before the save happens and set to NO when it finishes. Then all the user actions would have to be stalled if codesaveProcessActivecode is YES. The problem with this scenario is that it would result in a delay of the user action, potentially visible to the user, but maybe any delay is insignificant. It would only need to be as long as the save takes until its next check of codeabortSavecode. The aborted save process would then turn codesaveProcessActivecode to NO when it acknowledged the abort request. Is there a better solutionp

Negative 242 h2DONE SO FARh2  pI use AForge MJPEGStream to get bitmaps from different IPcams and display them in my app. Now I want to record multiple like at least 8 of these bitmapstreams to the local HDD. I already  used AForge AVIWriter DLL to write the file of 1 stream from a List, but because those Bitmaps all go in RAM I had to write it to HDD earlier so I can record 8 streams at once. So I tried to write a frame every NewFrameevent to HDD. The problem with this is that AVIWriter.Openstring fileName, int width, int height uses Win32.OpenFileMode.Create instead of Win32.OpenFileMode.ReadWrite and so deleting the videofile instead of opening it to add a frame. p  h2Preferred goalh2  pRecord multiple MJPEG streams to disk as video filescould be done from the NewFrameeven described above, which provides Bitmaps. The very best result would be 1 hour long .MKV files encoded with X264. I dont care how to achieve this goal as long as its done within my existing project in C so no need to keep using AForge.p

Negative 242 pI was hoping someone would know a way or a direction to correct the lack of support that jScrollPane has for rendering while Scale Transformed.p  pFor containers that are scaled with larger scaleFactors the scrollbar often gets stuck at the bottom. The scroll bar also tends to accelerate away from the mouse drag to suggest a miss calculation.p  pI have also tried this approach with the library mCustomScrollbar and had the same results. Could this be a jQuery issue.

Negative 242 pso I have the following test Go code which is designed to read from a binary file through stdin, and send the data read to a channel, where it would then be processed further. In the version Ive given here, it only reads the first two values from stdin, although thats fine as far as showing the problem is concerned.p  precodepackage main  import      fmt     io     os   func inputdc chan []byte      data  make[]byte, 2     var err error     var n int     for err  io.EOF          n, err  os.Stdin.Readdata         if n gt 0              dc lt data[0n]                 func main      dc  makechan []byte, 1     go inputdc     fmt.Printlnltdc  codepre  pTo test it, I first build it using go build, and then send data to it using the command p  precode.inputtest lt data.bin codepre  pThe data I am using currently to test is just random binary data created using the openssl command.p  pThe problem I am having is that it misses the first values from Stdin, and only gives the second and greater values. I think this is to do with the channel, as the same script with the channel removed produces the correct data. Has anyone come across this before For example, I get the following output when running this commandp  precode.inputtest lt data.bin [36 181] codepre  pWhereas I should be gettingp  precode.inputtest lt data.bin [72 218] codepre  pThe binary data is the same in both instances.p
Negative 242 pIm attempting to make an instruction editor in C and Im stuck on creating instructions. I need to be able to convert a string to an OpCode with Mono.Cecil but it doesnt seem to be able to do that. If its any easier I could create a codeDictionaryltstring, OpCodegtcode and populate that by enumerating through the OpCodes in codeOpCodescode, however codeOpCodescode is only class that contains the OpCodes as variables instead of in a list I think this might be for .NET 1 support preventing me from enumerating through them. Thats where I arrive to the problem, how can I either convert a string to an OpCode, or enumerate through every OpCode whichever is easierfaster.p

What I want to do is to codepushcode the original value onto the stack, and then retrieve it again when the subroutine finishes, for example, if the variable is located in coderdicode.p  precode    pushq rdi     call subroutine     movq rsp, rdi codepre  pNow, Im not really sure if this is the correct way to do it Ive read somewhere that a subroutine pushes the return value onto of the stack, but does that mean that I have to include an offset when I try to retrieve the variablep  pAlso I know I have to keep the stack pointer aligned by 16 bytes, which Im not quite sure if I do. In case I dont, will the assembler then give me an error, or could that be the reason why my program failsp  pAnd by the way, this program is part of an assignment, so I cannot share the code with you, but I hope my description is good enough.p

Negative 242 pI just compared this to other apps and they handle that nicer. I use a NSFetchedResultsController. If I delete a row in my tables, the row is deleted animtated and the others move up. However the delete button is visible until the rows are completely moved up. And then it disappears immediately.p  pIn some other apps the delete button gets smaller the more the rows move up which is much nicer.p  pHow can I change this behaviourp

Negative 242 pI know matlab matrix can be loaded into C program in some ways, while none of these ways seem to be efficient or convenient.  I have seen others modified the header of the .mat file, then it can be directly loaded into C program with armadillo. p  h2Anyone has ideas how to modify the header fileh2  pIts not just save the matlab .mat file into ascii format. The loading time and storage space is larger than binary format. To store a 2GB binary mat file, I need at least 20GB to store it in ASCII format.

Negative 242 pI wonder if there is a emfastem way to keep summing an element until a threshold is found.p  pFor examplep  precodethreshold100 a0 MAX1000 for i1MAX     aanormrnd2,1,1,1     if agtthreshold       indexi break      end   end codepre  pThis works fine, but it is quite slow. Cumsum would be really useful here. However, the only way I know to use cumsum in this situation is like this p  precodeacumsumnormrnd2,1, MAX,1  indexfindagtthreshold,1 codepre  pWhich become progressively more inefficient when MAX increase.p  pSo basically I am looking for a cumulative summation method that preserve the speed of cumsum but that allows me to set a threshold.

Negative 242 pI am trying to write a TCP proxy in c. The server only works with nonephemeral ports. The proxy is trying to mount a filesystem. So when I call the mount command bypassing the proxy it chooses an appropriate port and it connects. But when I try to connect via the proxy an appropriate port is selected for the connection between the client and the proxy, but the proxy uses an ephemeral port when it connects to the server. p  pI have read that it is not wise to specify a port, so I am looking to define a range of ports for it to choose from. Is this possible p  pAny advice and help is appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 242 pI am really at a standstill because of IE. So I have a website with a map and Im downloading the data from an XML file using geocodezips js extension to place the markers and respective infowindows. Everything works fine when I open the site with Firefox, Chrome and Safari but the markers wont display on IE.

However, I dont really want to do it that way as the more concrete classes I add that have their unique properties the more abstract methods I will have to include in the super class, and then implement them in each concrete class.p  pI want to keep my factory pattern and the abstract super class.

When he was charged in 1994, he was acquitted.

One major clue, a bloody earring apparently ripped from the ear of an assailant, has never helped police find the killer. 300 was taken from the store, but money was left in the register and the boys wallets were not taken. Police believed the boys were killed by one or more persons using a longbladed knife.

Negative 242 pI would like to know how to do some lowerlevel thing in C that will allow me to do some wacky math operations. Specifically my two questions arep  p1 How can I define my own math symbol that the compiler will be able to recognizes emin my codeem. In other words, Im not looking to parse a string from a user, but rather have the compiler recognize this as a new math operation.p  precode   ex   3  4   will actually do 3  4  etc. codepre  p2 How can I define a custom number from an ASCII symbol. For example, define the symbol  to be recognized by the compiler as 18 i.e. 00010010 in binary.p  precode   ex   18    18  18  0 codepre  pIf possible, I would like to be able to do the above two things at the compiler lever. Solutions in C, Java, C, Python, and ObjectiveC are fine. Just let me know what language your solution is in. Thanks p

Negative 242 pKind of baffled by this. Recently transferred over to a hrefhttpscode.google.comppircbotx relnofollowPircBotXa  coding a bot, etc. I have a command that basically requires you give a nick and it will grab the hostname. The nick is a codeStringcode, but PircBotX requires it to be a codeUsercode. Any idea how Id switch a codeStringcode to a codeUsercode so I can then grab the hostmaskp  pThank you in advanced.p
Negative 242 pOn my machine when I call codewglCreateContextAttribsARBcode asking for a 2.0 context, I get back 2.1.2. p  pThat seems seems close enough to correct, so it doesnt worry me.

Actually thats not a big deal, because when input  spacereturn, an inputhandler calls the function at p  precodetable.checkboxes[table.xcoorx[xindex]..table.ycoords[yindex]] codepre  pSo if the cursor doesnt point on a function, just nothing happens.

Negative 242 pI am fairly new to GitLibGit2Sharp and am trying to create a mirror of a git repository using LibGit2Sharp. Following the directions given here a hrefhttpsgithub.comlibgit2libgit2sharpissues577 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comlibgit2libgit2sharpissues577a, I first mirrored the external repository to a local folder by adding a remote to it, and used coderepo.Network.fetchremote, fetchRefSpeccode where codefetchRefSpeccode is coderefsrefscodep  pNow, I want to push the data to another remote repository. Here I am confused. Because, when doing this through git commands, you set the coderemote.remoteName.mirrorcode config entry to true and then do codegit push remoteNamecode. Specifying any other coderefSpeccode when mirror is set to true gives an error.p  pHowever, when using LibGit2Sharp, even after I set codemirror  truecode, I still have to provide a codepushRefSpeccode while pushing. Providing empty or wildcard coderefSpecscode throws exception. I even tried coderefstagsrefstagscode, but I got the same exception. Looping through all branches in the codepushRefSpeccode works, but does not create a mirror.p  pHas anyone tried this Is there probably a better way to do thisp

Negative 242 pI need to generate ideas with adwords keywords planner tool from a big amount of seed keywords. This process would be quite cumbersome to do manually, therefore I tried to automate it simulating human interaction with the tool via the javascript console.p  pThere is a textarea where to insert your seed keywords and a button to press.p  pI can change the text in the search box and I can trigger the find ideas button. But somehow even if I change the text in the box via javascript, when I trigger the find button, the text in the box is reverted to the last manual input before its sent. p  pI tried to trigger many event handlers keypress, change, keydown, keyup but nothing changed.p  pI suppose the text is saved in some variable when inputted manually, but cant understand why I cant simulate this processp  pAny ideasp

Each row inside the table represents an image file path and when a row is selected then the corresponding image should be displayed into the image view.p  pIve implemented my own UITableViewSource class where I override the RowSelected method as followsp  precode    public override void RowSelected UITableView tableView, MonoTouch.Foundation.NSIndexPath indexPath              var index  indexPath.Row         var item  tableItems [index]          selectedFilePath  item         var array  GetFilePathArray item         selectedFileName  GetFileName array          I should be using an interface but this is only a test         SavedPhotosViewtableView.Superview.SetSelectedFile selectedFileName, selectedFilePath           protected string[] GetFilePathArraystring path         string[] separators             return path.Split separators, StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries           protected string GetFileNamestring[] pathArray         var arrayLength  pathArray.Length         return pathArray [arrayLength  1]      codepre  pSavedPhotosView is the class I created to connect my SavedPhotosView.xib file to my project, the implementation I used is the followingp  precode[RegisterSavedPhotosView] public partial class SavedPhotosView  UIView      public SavedPhotosViewIntPtr h baseh            public SavedPhotosView          var arr  NSBundle.MainBundle.LoadNib SavedPhotosView, this, null         var v  Runtime.GetNSObject arr.ValueAt 0 as UIView         v.Frame  new RectangleF 0, 0, Frame.Width, Frame.Height           For some reason I can register the class for the cell here without receiving a null exception         SavedPhotosTableView.RegisterClassForCellReuse typeofUITableViewCell, NSStringSavedPhotosTableViewSource.cellIdentifier          AddSubview v           Method used to update the source of the table view, null exception isnt thrown here     public void SetSourceUITableViewSource source         InvokeOnMainThread delegate               SavedPhotosTableView.Source  source             SavedPhotosTableView.ReloadData                     Method that receives the file name and file path for the image to be displayed     public void SetSelectedFilestring filename, string filepath         UIImage selectedImage  UIImage.FromFile filepath          Null reference exception is thrown here, also if I try to update something on the table view here I get a null reference exception too         InvokeOnMainThread delegate              SelectedSaveImageView.Image  selectedImage                codepre  pI dont understand what is causing this exception, when I update the source object for my table view I dont encounter any exceptions, but on my other method neither my table view or my image view can be referenced at all.p  pI created the outlets for both my table view and image view in IB so I was expecting to be able to reference them from my C class with no problem.p  pIs my implementation wrong here How can reference other elements in my custom view without worrying about having this kind of exception to be thrownp  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pI noticed that when I call my SetSource method, Im doing that call from my ViewController that displays my custom view.p  pSo that means I can access to the outlets but only if the method is being called from inside my controller.p  pUnfortunately, when I tried to pass an instance of my ViewController into SavedPhotosView the C class that represents the binding the xib file with my Xamarin.iOS code as far as I understand, I debugged the application and indeed the reference is passed correctly when I create the instance of SavedPhotosView, but when my table view source handles the click event and tries to access to this View Controller instance the reference is null.p  pWhy is my reference being nullifiedp  pI tried with a static reference to my ViewController inside my SavedPhotosView but I dont like that workaround. It works but it is not my desired approach.p  pHow can I get ride of this workaround Or is this the only way to do thisp  pStack tracep  precodeSystem.NullReferenceException Object reference not set to an instance of an object   at TestCustomViewsiOS.UI.Views.SavedPhotosViewltSetSelectedFilegtcAnonStorey1.ltgtm0  [0x00012] in UsersxxxxxxxxxProjectsTestCustomViewsiOSTestCustomViewsiOSUIViewsSavedPhotosView.cs41   at MonoTouch.Foundation.NSActionDispatcher.Apply  [0x00000] in DeveloperMonoTouchSourcemaccoresrcFoundationNSAction.cs56   at at wrapper managedtonative MonoTouch.ObjCRuntime.MessagingvoidobjcmsgSendIntPtrIntPtrbool intptr,intptr,intptr,intptr,bool   at MonoTouch.Foundation.NSObject.InvokeOnMainThread MonoTouch.Foundation.NSAction action [0x00007] in DeveloperMonoTouchSourcemaccoresrcFoundationNSObject2.cs506   at TestCustomViewsiOS.UI.Views.SavedPhotosView.SetSelectedFile System.String filename, System.String filepath [0x00027] in UsersxxxxxxxxxxProjectsTestCustomViewsiOSTestCustomViewsiOSUIViewsSavedPhotosView.cs40   at TestCustomViewsiOS.ApplicationLayer.DataSource.SavedPhotosTableViewSource.RowSelected MonoTouch.UIKit.UITableView tableView, MonoTouch.Foundation.NSIndexPath indexPath [0x00048] in UsersxxxxxxxxxxProjectsTestCustomViewsiOSTestCustomViewsiOSApplicationDataSourceSavedPhotosTableViewSource.cs64   at at wrapper managedtonative MonoTouch.UIKit.UIApplicationUIApplicationMain int,string[],intptr,intptr   at MonoTouch.UIKit.UIApplication.Main System.String[] args, IntPtr principal, IntPtr delegate [0x00005] in DeveloperMonoTouchSourcemonotouchsrcUIKitUIApplication.cs62   at MonoTouch.UIKit.UIApplication.Main System.String[] args, System.String principalClassName, System.String delegateClassName [0x00038] in DeveloperMonoTouchSourcemonotouchsrcUIKitUIApplication.cs46   at TestCustomViewsiOS.Application.Main System.String[] args [0x00008] in UsersxxxxxxxxxxxxProjectsTestCustomViewsiOSTestCustomViewsiOSMain.cs17 codepre
Negative 242 pI have 2 text box controls on my page, one stores the date portion and the other the time portion. The values from both need to be parsed together to have a full datetime value. For example,p  pcontrol 1 112014 p  pcontrol 2 800amp  presult 112014 800amp  pHow can i achieve this in javascript or jquery The result above will be updating the value of a control that is bound to a property on my mvc model but just help on getting the values to combine to form a finished datetime value should be enough. p

Thus, when this snippet runs, codeline1code should contain the ASCII line, codeline2code the Japanese script, and codegoodcode should be true.p  pWhen compiled in VS2010, the result is as expected. But when compiled in VS2013, codeline1code contains the ASCII line, but codeline2code is empty, and codegoodcode is false.p  pI debugged into the CRT, as the source is provided with Visual Studio, and found that an internal function called codeMbrtowccode in file xmbtowc.c was modified between the two versions, and the way they use to detect a lead byte of a double byte character was changed, and the one in VS 2013 fails to detect a lead byte, thus fails to decode the byte stream.p  pFurther debugging revealed a point, where a codeCvtveccode objects codeIsleadbytecode array is initialized in the function codeGetcvtcode, in file xwctomb.c, and that initialization produces a wrong result. It seems that it always uses code page 1252, which is the default code page on my system, and not 932 which is set for the stream in use. However, I could not decide if it is by design, and I missed some required steps to get a good result, or this is indeed a bug in the CRT for VS2013.p  pUnfortunately I dont have VS2012 installed, so I could not test on that version.p  pAny insights on this topic are welcomep

If later on I want to change the url structure I have to change it in at least two places  possibly more.  Once where the incoming URL is matched to the controller, and once to construct the anchor element which a user will click to invoke that URL.p  pIs there a best practice way of dealing with this problem  It must be a common one.  Is it as simple as using Constants to represent the URLs and accessing these from different places  I know my example is simple but I am assuming the problem must exist for much larger web apps with complex URL structure so I want to understand what best practice is.p  pI hope this isnt a stupid question.  I am keen to ensure that I implement best practice right from the beginning.  I have looked through Stackoverflow and Google but nothing quite answers this specific question.p  pAny help gratefully received.p

With this, for 4 states, I have 16 trellis symbols to follow from X. H is Nr x Nt size and X is Nt x 42 size. After this, there is no problem to find Branch metrics BM matrix and going further. However, my problem here is as I use frequency selective channel, I have no longer constant size of such as Nr x Nt size H matrix. So, I have a problem to decode further. I get channel parameters individually. For example Nr1, Nt  2. That is why, I have H1 and H2 in simple terms. As I pass through frequency selective channel, I have impulse response of H1 and H2 with the equal size of transmitted signals and in this case, I am stuck. Help me on this please. How can I implement decoding over 2taps3taps channelsp  pRegardsp  pSametp

Negative 242 pIm working on the collision detection in my 2D Processing 2.2.1 game. Basically what I did was write a class which creates a box by defining the coordinates of its endpoints and which has a method to check if two of these boxes overlap.

Then basically implementing a get method which creates these boxes, I run into a return a result of type error. It says that the method is not returning the correct type of Box1. I dont really understand since the box which I am returning does fit the constructor.

Negative 242 pI am using Umbraco 7.1 and I have a custom Membership Provider, which I set up following various different tutorials and blog posts. For the most part it is working well, but there are a couple of things I dont understandp  pMy custom Membership Provider inherits from codeSystem.Web.Security.MembershipProvidercode the majority of tutorials I have read say it should inherit from codeUmbraco.Web.Security.Providers.MembersMembershipProvidercode but when I change it to inherit from that, the methods I have overridden are no longer hit, for example if I put a break point on codeValidateUserstring username, string passwordcode it will not get hit when I attempt to login. Can someone please explain which class I should inherit from and why That would be awesome.p  pSecondly, I have overridden codeGetAllUsersint pageIndex, int pageSize, out int totalRecordscode so when I login to the back office and go to Members, I can see a list of all of the people who have registered on the site. But when I click on a member to view their details, the codeGetUserobject providerUserKey, bool userIsOnlinecode method gets hit, but the providerUserKey is always codenullcode. In the table my Members are saved in, I have a column for the ProviderUserKey, I have tried setting it as a UniqueIdentifier and as a string, with the same result. So if someone could tell me how to view Member details in the back office with a custom Membership Provider, I would appreciate it. I am assuming this is possible, but I could well be wrong. p  pAny help at all greatly appreciated.p

Negative 242 pId like to be able to designate an arbitrary property val or def of a class which isnt defined in a easily mockable trait. The motivation is to provide flexible references to entities  a pair of value, property of an object to be matched against, like thisp  precodecase class Employeeid Long, name String case class Ref[E, T]value T, property Property[E]  def Ref[E, T]prop EgtT, value T  new Refvalue, Propertyprop codepre  pto use it likep  precodeval ref  Ref[Employee].name, Motoko val major Employee  repositoryref.head.get codepre  pThe task is to implement Property class, so that any two calls in the line ofp  precodeProperty[Employee].name ... Property[Employee]egt e.name codepre  pwill return equal instances and repository implementation can use an internal map Map[Property, Query] to create an appropriate select for the passed reference. My first attempt was to use javaassist to intercept and record method calls and used received overriden method as the property identifier, but it produced a NoSuchMethodError on some synthetic scala init method during mock creation before even reaching my handler. I feel it should be easily doable by some scala library like scalamock, but I wasnt able to find a relevant functionality in the API.p

Negative 242 pI have minimal experience with coding functions within software platforms i.e. SPSS syntax, MATLAB scripts, Psychopy coder. Due to this, I have found myself wishing I could code simple routine loops for more general programs. I am hoping that there is a way to do this for excel. Specifically, is there a way I can code excel to open a file, delete two columns serially, and save that file in a new location with a new file name and repeat this for all of the files in a containing folder I believe an answer to this question will be very useful for individuals with minimal coding experience that would benefit from a code that runs a simple function in excel automatically without having to point and click in the GUI. p

That is why I asked my customer to install the package prior to installing my software. I cannot be entirely sure though, that he did.p  pI have tried to reproduce the issue my customer describes on my own machine. First, I uninstalled all VC Runtime Redistributable Packages that I had installed on my development machinep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPcPDU.png altmsvcrp  pNo effect, everything still working fine on my machine.p  pI have then removed the following filesp  ul liCWindowsSystem32msvcr110.dllli liCWindowsSysWOW64msvcr110.dllli ul  pstrongThe issue is reproduced, I get exactly the same behavior as described by my customer.

Also, uninstalling the packages on my system did not reproduce the bug, so there seems to be no actual relation between the bug and the package which is the first thing I dont understand. Secondly, I dont know how to provide a proper fix. So my questions arep  pstrongA. Why is there no relation between the Visual C redistributables and the bugs, although obviously the missing DLL MSVCR110.DLL is what the redistributable package is all aboutstrongp  pstrongB. Why is the missing DLL MSVCR110.DLL not installed in the OS folders by the installer packagestrongp  pstrongC. Should MSVCR110.DLL exist in the OS folders anyway and what could be reasons it obviously doesnt on my clients machinestrongp  pstrongD. How can I provide a fix, that doesnt involve manual copying of DLLsstrongp  pI would be very happy about answers to any of these questions or ideas on how to proceed with the issue.

Negative 242 pGood day,p  pI have been debating some details with a colleague about ALSA vs PulseAudio, and need some help coming to a conclusion with it. Its to my understanding that ALSA is relatively lowlevel, and talks directly to the hardware, while PulseAudio sits on top of ALSA as a service.p  pAdditionally, its to my understanding that ALSA is tied to Linux, but PulseAudio just acts as an abstraction layer on top of ALSA, and can work on other platforms. My conclusion is that ALSA would provide lower audio latency on most strongLinuxstrong systems, while my colleague contends that PulseAudio provides better shorter latency regardless.p  pWhich of us is correct My reasoning is that since PulseAudio sits on top of ALSA or even wraps it, theres no way it could provide better latency unless its providing its own lowlevel calls.p  pThank you.p

Negative 242 pI need some suggestions on using d3.js for visualizing big data. I am pulling data from hbase and storing in a json file for visualizing using d3.js. When I pull the data of few hours the size of json file is around 100MB and can be easily visualized by d3.js but the filtering using dc.js and crossfilter is little slow. But when I pull the dataset of 1 week the json file size becomes more than 1GB and try to visualize using d3.js, dc.js and crossfilter then the visualization is not working properly and the filtering is also not possible. Can anyone give me any idea whether there is a good solution to this or I need to work on different platform instead of d3p

Negative 242 pIm having a bit of trouble getting Turbine to work in Spring Cloud.  In a nutshell, I cant determine how to configure it to aggregate circuits from more than one application at a time.p  pI have 6 separate services, a eureka server, and a turbine server running in standalone mode.  I can see from my Eureka server that all of the services are registered, including turbine.  My turbine server is up and running, and I can see its hystrix page without issue.  But when I try to use it to examine turbine.stream, I only see the FIRST server that is listed in turbine.appConfig, the rest are ignored.p  pThis is my Turbine servers application.yml, or at least the relevant partsp  precode eureka   client     serviceUrl       defaultZone httplocalhost8010eureka server   port 8030 info   component Turbine turbine   clusterNameExpression new Stringdefault   appConfig sentence,subject,verb,article,adjective,noun management   port 8990   codepre  pWhen I run this and access the hystrix dashboard on my turbine instance, asking for the turbine.stream, the ONLY circuit breakers listed in the output are for the first service listed in appConfig, the sentence service in this case.  Curiously, if I rearrange the order of these services and put another one first like noun, I see only the circuits for THAT service.  Only the first service in the list is displayed.p  pIll admit to being a little confused on some of the terminology, like streams, clusters, etc., so I could be missing some basic concept here, but my understanding is that Turbine could digest streams from more than one service and aggregate them in a single display.  Suggestions would be appreciated.p

Negative 242 pIm trying to make a simple implementation of the Heartbleed Bug in CC over Linux Using ElementaryOS on vmplayer. From my understanding of the heartbleed bug, it involves the client sending a heartbeat request to the server, specifying a greater size for the included payload than the actual size of the payload, which results in the server including contents from memory that will be laid out after the local payload buffer, in the response.p  pWhat I have so far is a clientserver application. The client connects to the server and sends a piece of sensitive information, in this case, a password. Next, the client sends a heartbeat request to the server, specifying the wrong size for the payload. I declare my local variables like this p  precode        char password[30]  new char[30]    Some sensitve data, that will be accessed using the Heartbleed Bug         char temp[15]  new char[15]         char payload[45]  new char[45] codepre  pI retrieve the content from the heartbeat request like thisp  precode        int payloadSize  atoistrtokbuffer,           temp  strtokNULL, n codepre  pIn the heartbeat request, the payload is payload, and the size is 45. I then make a call to memcpy like this p  precode        memcpypayload, temp, payloadSize  45 in this case  codepre  pIm expecting the payload variable to be hold the value payload, followed by contents from the password variable.

Negative 242 pHello and thank you for your help.p  pI am managing several PowerPoint files that are under constant revision.  As it stands right now, whenever a revision is made, the date is changed on an Excel file to keep record but also needs to be changed manually on the first slide of the PowerPoint file.  We manage all of the revison dates for the PowerPoints in a column of an Excel file, and I thought it would be easier to have the date change in PowerPoint automatically each time the Excel file is updated.  We are having issues with people forgetting to change the date in the PowerPoint file and such so I would like to have this automated.  p  pPlease let me know your ideas on the best way to approach this using Visual Basic. p  pThank you.p

As I said, it could be fixed by executing Clean all projects.p  pHeres the pom.xml file of the AggregationHandler projectp  precodeltproject xmlnshttpmaven.apache.orgPOM4.0.0 xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance xsischemaLocationhttpmaven.apache.orgPOM4.0.0 httpmaven.apache.orgxsdmaven4.0.0.xsdgt ltmodelVersiongt4.0.0ltmodelVersiongt  ltartifactIdgtAggregationHandlerltartifactIdgt  ltnamegtAggregation Handlerltnamegt ltdependenciesgt     ltdependencygt         ltgroupIdgtcom.evercompliantltgroupIdgt         ltartifactIdgtCrawlerUtilsltartifactIdgt         ltversiongt0.0.1SNAPSHOTltversiongt         ltscopegtcompileltscopegt     ltdependencygt ltdependenciesgt ltbuildgt     ltsourceDirectorygtsrcmainjavaltsourceDirectorygt     ltpluginsgt         ltplugingt             ltartifactIdgtmavenjarpluginltartifactIdgt             ltversiongt2.6ltversiongt             ltexecutionsgt                 ltexecutiongt                     ltidgtdefaultjarltidgt                     ltphasegtpackageltphasegt                     ltgoalsgt                         ltgoalgtjarltgoalgt                     ltgoalsgt                 ltexecutiongt             ltexecutionsgt             ltconfigurationgt                 ltarchivegt                     ltmanifestgt                         ltmainClassgtcom.evercompliant.aggregationhandler.service.DoActionltmainClassgt                     ltmanifestgt                 ltarchivegt                 ltdescriptorRefsgt                     ltdescriptorRefgtjarwithdependenciesltdescriptorRefgt                 ltdescriptorRefsgt             ltconfigurationgt         ltplugingt         ltplugingt             ltartifactIdgtmavenassemblypluginltartifactIdgt             ltexecutionsgt                 ltexecutiongt                     ltphasegtpackageltphasegt                     ltgoalsgt                         ltgoalgtsingleltgoalgt                     ltgoalsgt                 ltexecutiongt             ltexecutionsgt             ltconfigurationgt                 ltarchivegt                     ltmanifestgt                         ltmainClassgtcom.evercompliant.aggregationhandler.service.DoActionltmainClassgt                     ltmanifestgt                 ltarchivegt                 ltdescriptorRefsgt                     ltdescriptorRefgtjarwithdependenciesltdescriptorRefgt                 ltdescriptorRefsgt             ltconfigurationgt         ltplugingt     ltpluginsgt ltbuildgt  ltparentgt     ltgroupIdgtcom.evercompliantltgroupIdgt     ltartifactIdgtPipelineMultiModuleltartifactIdgt     ltversiongt0.0.1SNAPSHOTltversiongt     ltrelativePathgt..PipelineMultiModuleltrelativePathgt ltparentgt codepre  pp  pProblem is, I now need to build this project on a linux environment, without eclipse.

Negative 242 pI have an Android App with a single activity. The activity contains a SlidingTabLayout with a ViewPageAdapter as in a hrefhttpwww.exoguru.comandroidmaterialdesignnavigationandroidslidingtabswithmaterialdesign.html relnofollowthisa example. Each tab contains a respective root fragment which I then replace with other fragments as the user uses that screen. A visual representation is shown belowp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comqMmrm.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqMmrm.png altenter image description hereap  pWith my current implementation I do the following go to tab1, the ProductListFragment immediately loads by replacing the ProductRootFragment with the ProductListFragment. I click on a product and it replaces the ProductListFragment with the ProductDetailFragment. Now I switch to tab2 and Tab2ListFragment immediately loads by replacing Tab2RootFragment. I click on an item and the Tab2DetailFragment replaces the Tab2ListFragment. I now return to Tab1 and, as I expect, ProductDetailFragment is still displayed. However, if I now click the back button, it doesnt take me back to ProductListFragment as I expect. Instead it pops off Tab2DetailFragment from the backstack.p  pI want to implement a separate backstack for each tab fragment. There are several posts about this already but they all seem to be outdated and some suggest very elaborate solutions. See a hrefhttpstausiq.wordpress.com20140606androidmultiplefragmentsstackineachviewpagertab relnofollowherea, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6987334separatebackstackforeachtabinandroidusingfragmentsherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15313598onceforallhowtocorrectlysaveinstancestateoffragmentsinbackstackherea...p  pIt seems that in the latest versions of the SDK Android can automatically handle this backstack hierarchy without the need to manually implement some kind of backstack by using getChildFragmentManager rather than getSupportFragmentManager in my transactions where I replace the fragments. I have, however, not been able to get this to work.

Negative 242 pIm using AFNetworking 2 and AFHTTPRequestOperationManager credentials for digest authentication. Everything works fine. Now I want to log out and log in with another user, But I cant clear session. I tried everything.

If I logout then wait for some time session clears automatically and I logged in with user successfully, but when I logout and login immediately credentials are wrong.p

Negative 242 pI am studying about logstash and how to use its filters and grok patterns.

Like thisp  precodedate      match gt [ timestamp, ddMMMYYYYMMmmss Z]     locale gt en  codepre  pWhat this is doing is storing another field with differently formatted date. My question is, why store two date fields representing the same date with just different format. Can we not use the date field from first stage the way we can use the date field from second stage p

Negative 242 pI am currently backtesting a strategy which involves an codelmcode regression and a probit codeglmcode regression. I have a dataframe named codeforBacktestcode with 200 rows 1 for each day to backtest and 9 columns  the first 8 codex1code to codex8code are the explanatory variables and the last one codex9code is the real value which I am trying to explain in the regression. To do the regression, I have an other dataframe named codetempcode which has like 1000 rows one for each day and a lot of columns, some of which are the codex1code to codex8code values and also the codex9code value. p  pBut the tricky part is that I do not just make a regression and then a loop for codepredictcode because I select a part of the dataframe codetempcode based on the values of codex1code which I split in 8 different ranges and then, according to the value codex1code of the dataframe codeforBacktestcode, I make a regression with a part of codetempcode with codex1code in a given range.p  pSo what I do is that for each one of the 200 rows, I take codex1code and if codex1code is between 0 and 1 for example then I create a part of codetempcode where all the codex1code are between 0 and 1, then I make a regression to explain codex9code with codex1code, codex2code, ... codex9code just codex1x2...code, there is no codex1x2code, codex12code,... and then I use the codepredictcode function with the dataframe codeforBacketstcode. If I predict a positive value and if codex9code is positive then I increment a counter codesuccesscode by one idem if both are negative, but if one is positive and the other negative, then codesuccesscode stays the same. Then I take the next row and so on. At the end of the 200 rows, I now have an average of the successes which I return. In fact, I have two averages  one for the codelmcode regression and the other for the codeglmcode regression same methodology, I just take codesignx9code for the variable to explain.p  pSo my question would be  how can I efficiently make that in R, if possible without a big for loop with 200 iterations where for each iteration, it creates a part of the dataframe, makes the regressions, predict the two values, add them to a counter and so on  this is currently my solution but I find it too slow and not very Rlikep  pMy code looks like that p  precodebacktestltfunction      for i in 1dimforBacktest[1]          x1ltforBacktest[i,1]x2ltforBacktest[i,2]...x9ltforBacktest[i,9]         altifelsex1gt1.5,1.45,ifelsex1gt1,0.95,....          bltifelsex1gt1.5,100,ifelsex1gt1,1.55,....         temp2lttemp[tempx1gta100amptempx1ltb100,]         dfltdataframetempx1,tempx2,...tempx9         regltlmtempx9.,datadf         df2ltdata.framex1,x2,...x9         rRegltpredictreg,df2         trueOrFalseltifelsesignrRegx9gt0,1,0         successltsuccesstrueOrFalse          success  codepre

Negative 242 pWe have an main international website which trades in 4 different currencies GBP,USD,AUD,EUR with GEOIP turned on to change the currency on the fly to the customers native currency.p  pWe recently decided to advertise our products on Google Shopping with just GBP prices. The issue was that when a customer from USA happens to log in via www.google.co.uk and see products listed in GBP they would be redirected to a product landing page with the products listed in USD because of GEOIP turned on.p  pGoogle penalised us for this so we have turned off GEOIP and changed the default curency to GBP.p  pWe would like to turn geoip back on but only for the main site.p  pmy question, is there any way that we can turnoff redirects for googleshopping customer that redirected to our site so that they can see the products in GBP The catch is we want customers currency to change when they are accessing the site from the main URL.p  pRgds,p  pKushp

Negative 242 pBelow is the quote from springs documentation of AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor,p  blockquote   pOnly one constructor at max of any given bean class may carry this   annotation with the required parameter set to true, indicating the   constructor to autowire when used as a Spring bean. If multiple   nonrequired constructors carry the annotation, they will be   considered as candidates for autowiring. The constructor with the   greatest number of dependencies that can be satisfied by matching   beans in the Spring container will be chosen. If none of the   candidates can be satisfied, then a default constructor if present   will be used.
