Positive 4301 pI am looking after a system with many hundreds of c files in many folders, there are multiple targets so not all the c files are required in each build.p  pBecause not all files are required I cannot use a pure recursive build.

Positive 4301 pI just installed a hrefhttpswww.music.mcgill.cagaryrtmidi relnofollowRtMidia for a project and compiled it. The examples in the codetestscode folder work and so does my code if I put it in the folder and include it in the Makefile that compiles all the examples.

Positive 4301 pSuppose my source files are located inp  precodedevroot codepre  pInside codedevrootcode are a number of projects.p  pe.g.p  precodedevrootlibrarieslibx devrootappsappappy devrootdockerappy codepre  pThe build tool I use is called tundra2 and is invoked from the root level.p  pSo if I run tundra2 production appy itll produce its output top  precodedevroott2outputlinux64gccproductiondefault codepre  pThe binary is directly below that directory.  There are also intermediate files located within subdirectories in that directory.p  pNow the annoying bit.  For whatever reason, docker build uses a daemon process that copies everything from the directory its being run from to a temporary directory.  It then produces its image from there.  I havent yet spent the time to try and extend tundra2 to cope with docker so Ive been using a Makefile.p  pSo inside the dockerappy directory I have my Dockerfile.  Alongside I have a makefile.  The idea is to cd into that directory and run make. If everything builds, it should copy the outputs from t2output into the dockerappy directory and run docker build.p  pSo far, Ive specified the build targets likep  precodeT2OUT....t2outputlinux64gccproductiondefault TAG  appy all T2OUTappy  T2OUTappy       cd T2OUT ampamp tundra2 production appy      cp lt .      docker build t TAG . codepre  petcp  pThe above is very cumbersome.

Positive 4301 pIve read numerous tutorials and stackex questionsanswers, but apparently my questions is too specific and my knowledge too limited to piece together a solution. p  pstrong[Edit]strong emMy confusion was mostly due to the fact that my project required both a shell script and a makefile to run a simple python program. I was not sure why that was necessary, as it seemed like such a roundabout way to do things. It looks like the makefile and script are likely just there to make the autograder happy, as the kind respondents below have mentioned.

Handles signal callbacks, etc.li licommand.py  holds command line automation functions not dependent on data in the application classli listate.py  holds the state data persistence classli ul  pThis has served fairly well so far, but at this point application.py is starting to get rather long.

At a certain point the primary module starts to get very long and there is not obvious way of breaking the code out into narrower modules without sacrificing clarity and object orientation.p  pI have considered making the GUI the primary module and having seperate modules for the toolbar routines, the menus routines, etc, but at that point I believe I will lose most of the benefits of OOP and end up with an everythingreferenceseverything scenario.p  pShould I just deal with having a very long central module or is there a better way of structuring the project so that I dont have to rely on the class browser so muchp  pstrongEDIT Istrongp  pOk, so point taken regarding all the MVC stuff.  I do have a rough approximation of MVC in my code, but admittedly I could probably gain some mileage by further segregating the model and controller.  However, I am reading over pythongtkmvcs documentation which is a great find by the way, thank you for referencing it and my impression is that its not going to solve my problem so much as just formalize it.  My application is a single glade file, generally a single window. So no matter how tightly I define the MVC roles of the modules Im still going to have one controller module doing most everything, which is pretty much what I have now. Admittedly Im a little fuzzy on proper MVC implementation and Im going to keep researching, but it doesnt look to me like this architecture is going to get any more stuff out of my main file, its just going to rename that file to controller.py.p  pShould I be thinking about separate ControllerView pairs for seperate sections of the window the toolbar, the menus, etc Perhaps that is what Im missing here.  It seems that this is what S. Lott is referring to in his second bullet point.p  pThanks for the responses so far.p

The default halt action is to divide by zero other platforms require different tricks to force a watchdog induced reboot such as an infinite loop with interrupts disabled. For a PC linux test environment, I wanted to disable the halt on division by zero without relying on things like assert. p

Negative 4301 pI have a situation where my XSLT files should display prices alongwith decimals conditionally, depending on whether the input XML contains decimals or not. So, I can receive XML files with two types of values  XML will contain all prices formatted with decimals upto two places I call this one DecimalXML or the prices will be rounded off to the nearest integer I call this one IntegerXML.p  pMy problem is that I need to refactor as little as possible in the XSLT files and yet allow them to apply the transformation to XHTML in the same format as the XML input. In order to accomplish this, I implemented and suggested three guidelines to my teamp  ol liRemove all codeformatnumbercode function calls when the value is being computed for calculations or stored in a variable. Use codenumberltvaluegtcode instead. However, certain conditions apply to this rule See below.li liWhen the value is to be displayed, use the codeformatnumberltvaluegt, .code format. This should ensure that integer or decimal values will be displayed as originally present in the XML. li liFor optional tags such as Discount, use the codeformatnumberltvaluegt, 0.00code function even if the value is only being computed. This is necessary because if the tag is absent, trying to obtain a value will give an codeNaNcode result.li ol  pHere is a illustrative example of the XSLTp  precode  ltxstylesheet version1.0 xmlnsxhttpwww.w3.org1999XSLTransformgt   ltxtemplate matchgt     lthtmlgt       ltbodygt         lttable border1 width60gt           lttrgt             ltthgtSimpleltthgt             ltthgtnumberltthgt             ltthgtformatnumberampltexpressionampgt, 0.00ltthgt             ltthgtformatnumberampltexpressionampgt, .ltthgt           lttrgt           ltxapplytemplates gt         lttablegt       ltbodygt     lthtmlgt   ltxtemplategt    ltxtemplate matchItemgt     ltxvariable nameqty selectnumbernumItems gt     ltxvariable namecost selectnumberItemCost  qty gt     ltxvariable nameextraCharges selectnumberTax  numberTxnFee  qtygt     ltxvariable namediscount selectformatnumberDiscount, 0.00  qtygt     lttrgt       lttdgt       lt Works for IntegerXML, but values in DecimalXML are       sometimes rendered upto 14 decimal places.

Negative 4301 pstrongBackground Info File Replication is Lamestrongp  pCurrently, we have a massive, hightraffic ASP.NET web application loadbalanced across 8 different IIS servers.  Due to the nature of the site, minor changes to .aspx files and .ascx controls happen frequently throughout the day, and after being tested and published to live, are replicated out to each of the public webservers through xcopy deployment on a scheduled basis every 10 minutes.p  pOf course this is incredibly inefficient, as each server must have a redundant copy of the entire site, and we would like to eliminate the 10minute publishing lag.p  pstrongPossible Improvement Hosting from Shared Storagestrongp  pWe now have the option to use centralized storage with an iSCSI interface to host the entire site centrally, with each server believing that the remote storage is a local drive.  Publishes would be instantaneous and systemwide.p  pemNote Hosting the drive off a UNC share is not possible, as there are so many different directories in the site structure, each requiring a FileSystemWatcher for ASP.NET to monitor for changes, that the SMB maximum command count is quickly reached.  Yes, we know about the MaxCmds and MaxMpxCt registry settings.emp  pstrongThe Problem Web.config changes trigger massive recompilesstrongp  pThe problem we forsee is that certain changes to the file system structure can cause nearly every compiled .aspx or .ascx to have to recompile, causing queued requests and a perception that the server is down.  Most resources are not used systemwide and so recompiling them on a change causes hardly a blip in resources.  A global master page used by all pages on the site can cause this, but this can easily be managed by code.p  pThe primary culprit is the web.config file.  Changes to the web.config file cause the entire web application to recycle, and recompilations to occur.  So, we currently dont replicate web.config changes.  Any web.config changes requires bringing the web server off the load balancer, applying and testing the changes, and then warming the server up with junk requests before it is placed back on the load balancer.p  pHowever, if the web.config file, like the rest of the web applications directory structure, is located on centralized storage, there is only one copy of the file, and individual servers could not be patched and warmed up anymore.p  pstrongThe Questionstrongp  pIs there a way to get an ASP.NET web application to take its marching orders from a source other than a file named Web.configp  pIdeally there would be one file per server, for examplep  ul lidefault.aspxli liglobal.asaxli liWebServerA.configli liWebServerB.configli li...li liWebServerN.configli ul  pWhere is the name web.config defined anyway  Is there a registry setting that could be set on a perserver basis  Is there an entry that could be made in the machine.config or the global web.config to specify what file to usep  pstrongThings Out Of Scopestrongp  pJust so I am clear, I am not asking how to have different AppSettings for debug, test, and live.  There are other topics that cover this, and all my web.configs will be identical most of the time, the only time I need them to be different is when an update is being performed.p  pWe arent using the web.config for any appSettings information this is for the really important stuff, like assembly references, httpHandler definitions, and other system.web settings that can not be databased.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI tried searching the registry for Web.config, and found nothing except for applications that noted that I had recently edited web.config files, which I apparently do a lot.

Negative 4301 pSo I am using FCKeditor and the problem I am having is that when the user writes the document sometimes info is copied from Word, other times it is written directly in the editor and other times it could be done both ways.  What this leaves me with in the DB is a lot of tags that are open and never closed.  This is throwing my layout off dramatically and I am trying to find a solution.  p  pI changed the config file to paste as plain text, which I assumed would stop Word formatting from transferring over, and it is still doing it.  p  pSo now I am trying to figure out a way to search for the opening tags and delete them before the info is sent to the DB is possible.  Or is there some FCKeditor functionconfig option I am missing to aid mep  pAny suggestions on how I should proceedp  pThanksbr  Levip

Negative 4301 pI have JAXWS style web service client that was autogenerated with the NetBeans IDE.p  pThe generated proxy factory extends javax.xml.ws.Service delegates proxy creation to the various Service.getPort methods. The application that I am maintaining instantiates the factory and obtains a proxy each time it calls the targetted service.p  pCreating the new proxy factory instances repeatedly has been shown to be expensive, given that the WSDL documentation supplied to the factory constructor, an HTTP URI, is reretrieved for each instantiation.p  pWe had success in improving the performance by caching the WSDL. But this has ugly maintenance and packaging implications for us.p  pI would like to explore the suitability of caching the proxy factory itself.  Is it safe, e.g., can two different client classes, executing on the same JVM and targetting the same web service, safely use the same factory to obtain distinct proxy objects or a shared, reentrant onep  pIve been unable to find guidance from either the JAXWS specification nor the javax.xml.ws API documentation. The factoryproxy multiplicity is unclear to me. Having Service.getPort rather than Service.createPort does not inspire confidence.p

Negative 4301 pOk, so the situation is as follows.p  pI have a server with services for a game, a particular command from the server sends a timestamp for when the next game round should commence. To get this perfectly synced on all connected clients I also have a webbservice that returns a timestamp of the servers current time.p  pWhat I know the time between request sent and answer recieved. What I dont know where the latency lies, on client processing or server processing or bandwidth issues.p  pWhat is the best practice to get a reasonable result here. I guess that GPS must have solved this in some fashion but Ive been unable to find a good pattern.p  pWhat I do now is to add half the latency of the request to the server timestamp, but its not quite good enough. This may have to do that the time between send and recieve can be as high as 11 seconds.p  pSuggestionsp

So this appears to have something to do with the UIRepeat component. In fact, it seems like UIRepeat has some special handling for when its nested inside another UIRepeat.p  pFrom what I gather, UIRepeat essentially rerenders the same component several times. Between each call to render, it loads the state value, localValue, submittedValue of all child components implementing codeEditableValueHoldercode from an internal map keyed on the rendered components actual id. Ive tried putting break points when this occurs to track what value is inserted into the map of saved states, but its really a mess, as the saveChildState and restoreChildState methods are called about a gazillion times.p  pAny ideas Can I go about this differently What I really need is be able to render a table that grows dynamically both horizontally and vertically, containing checkboxes, input fields, etc. I glanced at codelthdataTablegtcode but I believe it wont work in this case.p

Negative 4301 pat the top of my template workflow I put a ReceiveRequest  SendReply block where Id like to perform synchronous operations, enabling then the user client to receive a timely response of the workflow being started. strongClient calls the WF via WCF.strongp  pClient knows about the status of the current request with status of an entry on my application database. p  pFor example, I create an order, call a PlaceOrderWF, set the status of the order on DB to Accepted. The client can then perform whatever he wants while the WF is doing checks, controls, etc, ..., setting the final value of the order to Completed or Error.p  pstrongI expect that the client will receive response just after the SendResponse block. Actually it doesnt seem to work this way, but it waits for some kind of event to release the client.

Negative 4301 pFirst some backstory. I have a base vew that three of my apps primary views extend. The child views are empty, analog and digital. I place these child view into a gridview 2x3 and the gridview into a slidingdraw. This sliding drawer is the crux of my app. It is absolutely necessary. The sliding drawer must be in every activity, so on activity changes, I just store the state in the aapplication and retrieve it when the new activity loads.p  pWhen the app opens, the gridview creates six empty view and adds them to its adapter. Now while all of the views are empty the app works flawlessly. I can wander through the activities and do all of the other function that the app has. And while I stay in the same activity, I can create analog and digital views to my hearts content. They move, delete and do all their functions properly. But as soon as I go to switch to another activity strongANDstrong I have even one analog or digital view in the gridview, the app crashes via codeOutOfMemoryError bitmap size exceeds VM Budgetcode. p  pBoth the analog and digital view create two bitmaps for them selves. One is a the background for the view and the other is the unique look of the view that changes so rarely, it is better suited as a bitmap. Both bitmaps are fairly small 221x221 px on my test Evo. This made me think that I wasnt recycling them properly on activity changes. So I went back and checked that everything was being cleaned up and made a method that completely destroyed each view. Every variable is set to null and all bitmaps are recycled when ever the activity pauses. Note Using the logger, I verified that onPause is indeed being called as well as my destroy method.p  pNow  days later  I still cant figure out why this memory error is being thrown. I have spent an unaccountable amount of time viewing the DDMS and Memory Tracker and it is quite possibly the most useless thing ever. I am completely fed up with DDMS, I cannot get the stupid thing to tell me anything useful. p  pSo now the question. Is there a way method  system call or something that I can get the complete list of allocations of a process my apps and print  display  save to a file  etc... itp  pstrongEdit 1strong  this is in response Falmarri. I may be posting a little to much and I apologize for that. If you want to look at something more specific I am more than happy to help, there is no reason for you to tear through my code.p  pThe clip is from the BaseViewp  precodepublic abstract class

Negative 4301 pI would like to check whether the session has been timed out or not via ASMXWCF AJAX call without extending the session.p  pMy Session timeout is 30 minutes. If I am making a AJAX call to check at 15th minute, Session is automatically extending another 30 minutes considering this call a valid user call.p  pIs there a way to check session has been timed out or not via AJAX callp  pThanks Krishp
Negative 4301 pI currently have a login form on my website, which POSTs to another web based serviceweb portal that i run. This allows people to login to the web portal directly from my home pagebypassing the actual login page of the portal. This is all working fine, except that if wrong usernamepassword combo is entered, the form will still POST to the web portal, which then displays login failedp  pProposed Solution     Use CURL to perform a POST on the server side, and then check the responce html for the words Login Failed.     If the text Login Failed is found, the login form should display an error.     If the text Login Failed is NOT found, the login form should continue to POST to the web portal.p  pCould someone please correct me if there is a simpler method Any links or snippets that could point me in the correct direction would be gratefully received.p

Negative 4301 pI am  Python newbie trying to understand the answer given a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions914382howcanicountuniquetermsinaplaintextfilecaseinsensitively930185930185herea to the question of counting unique words in a document. The answer isp  precodeprint lensetw.lower for w in openfilename.dat.read.split codepre  blockquote   pReads the entire file into memory, splits it into words using   whitespace, converts each word to lower case, creates a unique set   from the lowercase words, counts them and prints the outputp blockquote  pTo try understand that, I am trying to implement it in Python step by step. I can import the text tile using open and read, divide it into individual words using split, and make them all lower case using lower. I can also create a set of the unique words in the list. However, I cannot figure out how to do the last part  count the number of unique words.p  pI thought I could finish by iterating through the items in the set of unique words and counting them in the original lowercase list, but I find that that the set construct is not indexable. p  pSo I guess I am trying to do something that in natural language is like, for all the items in the set, tell me how many times they occur in the lower case list. But I cannot quite figure out how to do that, and I suspect some underlying misunderstanding of Python is holding me back.p  ul liEDIT  li ul  pGuys thanks for the answers. I have just realised I did not explain myself correctly  I wanted to find not only the total number of unique words which I understand is the length of the set but also the number of times each individual word was used, e.g. the was used 14 times, and was used 9 times, it was used 20 times and so on.

Negative 4301 pI was getting some odd behaviour out of a switch block today, specifically I was reading a byte from a file and comparing it against certain hex values text file encoding issue, no big deal.  The code looked something likep  precodechar BOM[3]  0 berror  ReadFile iNCfile, BOM, 3, amplpNumberOfBytesRead, NULL   switch  BOM[0]   case 0xef       Byte Order Marker Potentially Indicates UTF8     if   BOM[1]  0xBB  ampamp  BOM[2]  0xBF            iNCfileEncoding  UTF8          break              codepre  pWhich didnt work, although the debug looked ok.  I realized that the switch was promoting the values to integers, and once that clicked in place I was able to match using 0xffffffef in the case statement.  Of course the correct solution was to make BOM[] unsigned and now everything promotes and compares as expected.p  pCan someone briefly explain what was going on in the char  int promotion that produced 0xffffffef instead of 0x000000efp

Negative 4301 pIm writing python program that needs to process a lot of small but complex protobufencoded messages. I tried to use the Python implementation of protocol buffers, which is written in pure python, but its performance is really terrible.p  pSo Im looking into a solution that apparently a hrefhttpnews.ycombinator.comitemid2145768some folks got to worka  use protoc to generate C files, then use swig to wrap them with python. The problem is that I cant get to a working Python module.p  ul lipWhen running swig with codeincludeallcode, to ensure that all the Google baseutility classes used by the generated message classes also get wrapped  swig fails, complaining about missing system include files e.g. string. I couldnt work around this with I flags or copying of entire include directories. The environment is Ubuntu 10.04, protobuf 2.2.0, swig 1.3.40, gcc 4.4.3.pli lipWithout this flag, Im able to generate a python module for my message classes, but this module is useless the generated Python message classes are missing all the functions provided by the Message  base class  in particular all but one of the deserialization methods. The one method left MergePartialFromCodedStream wont run, because it requires an input stream of type CodedInputStream which is part of the protobuf infrastructure and was therefore not wrapped with swig.pli ul  pI was wondering if anyone has a working example of getting swig to work on top of protobufCp  pAlternatively  is there an example of some other solution, such as the Python extension mentioned in the same page Though that seems like a highmaintenance solution for my dynamic schema...p  pIf none of this works Im considering dropping python in favor of Groovy  assuming that the Java implementation of protocol buffers would be more efficient. Any comment on thatp  pMuchas Graciasp

I even used Firebug to manually convert the nonbreaking spaces to regular spaces and that fixed the text, so I know its not a problem with my CSS.

Negative 4301 pIm writing a simple implementation of the GJK algorithm collision of convex shapes in Java, and it involves a lot of simple calculations on 3D vectors. In terms of performance vs readability, would it be better to store the points as double[3] and have a whole host of static methods to process them add, subtract, dot, cross, negate etc or use a class with the methods contained withinp  pThe problem with the array of doubles is that to do a simple subtraction for instance multiple loops are required if specialised methods are used, or the code becomes very long if theyre hardcoded in.

Negative 4301 pOften I find myself in a situation where I have to deal with catching some exceptions thrown by implementers of an interface. This ususally gets problematic when the different implementations deal with completely different types of devices etc depending on the implementation the amount and types of exceptions thrown vary greatly. Heres a typical examplep  precodeinterface DataStream    Data ReadNext   class DeserializingFileDataStream  DataStream    this one does file operations  serialization,   so can throw eg IOException, SerializationException, InvalidOperationException, ...   class NetworkDataStream  DataStream    get data over tcp   so throws IOException, SocketException   class HardwareDeviceDataStream  DataStream    read from a custom hardware device implemented in unmanaged code   so throws mainly custom exceptions  codepre  pLikely all these also throw ArgumentExceptions and so forth, but Im not interested in catching those in this case they would indicate programming errors. However I do not want the program to crash when a file is corrupted, a network cable is unplugged or the custom device goes berserk, so the other exceptions should be dealt with.p  pI already tried a couple of solutions but none of them I am particularly happy with, so the question is is there some common practicepattern to handle situations like these Please be concrete and do not tell me to look at ELMAH. Heres some things I used in the pastp  ul licodecatch Exception code well, its obvious what the problems areli licodeTryAndCatchDataStream Action what, ActionltExceptiongt errHandler code method consisting of a try followed by a catch for any exception of interest from any implementation. Meaning it has to be updated when implementations change or are addedremoved.li liput a comment on the interface saying should only throw DataStreamExceptions and in all implementations make sure this rule is followed by catching anything of interest and wrapping it in a DataStreamException, then throwing that. Not too bad, but adds noise to every implementation.li ul  pThen I have a second more general question about exception handling dont think its needed to make a seperate post for this I have some cases where method A calls B which calls C which calls D, and D throws a SomeException yet the caller of A catches the exception. Isnt this a sign there is something wrong with the code Because to be able to do this, the caller of A needs to know A will eventually call D. Unless A documents it can throw a SomeException but in both cases it means that when updating a mere implementation detail of A ie make it call something else than D, this change is visible to the users of A.p

Negative 4301 pSomewhat on the back of this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq1141931373706questiona that asks about the behaviour of the codeoutcode parameter but more focused as to why these codeTryParsecode methods use codeoutcode and not coderefcode. p  pThere have been some scenarios where you do want to initialise a value to the argument before parsing and keep that when the parsing fails but do not really care if it does fail. However because of the codeoutcode parameter the value is reset.p  pThis scenario could look like this... p  precodeint arg  123 Int32.TryParsesomeString, ref arg codepre  pHowever because of the codeoutcode parameter we have to write it like this, which is more verbose...p  precodeint arg ifInt32.TryParsesomeString, out arg      arg  123  codepre  pI realise that knowing that the parsing failed can be very useful however the use of coderefcode does not preclude this.p  pSo why do these TryParse methods use codeoutcode and not coderefcodep
Negative 4301 pI am taking a beginning Java class and stumbled on what seems like an error while testing a program I wrote for class.  I do not need help with the homework assignment. I would like to understand two things about nulls and one thing about parsing nulls. p  pFirstly, when you run my example code you will see that clicking the OK button on a swing input box without any input stores a string value that appears to be a null. However when the string is tested it does not test as a null. Why is thisp  pSecondly, when you run my example code you will see that clicking the Cancel button on a swing input box stores a value that appears to be a string containing the text null. This does test as a null value, but a string containing the text null obviously will not test as null. Why does the cancel button generate a string with the text null when I thought a null string value was p  pFinally, when you run my example code you will see that values that are tested as null throw a NullPointerException when parsed as a double, but they do not throw a NullPointerException when they are parsed as an int.  Why is thisp  pMy teacher could not answer these questions.  He thought that the parsing in the sample program was accomplished arithmetically, so the ints might behave differently because they do not deal with decimal points. That makes some sense to me, but if that is the case why do they parse differently with a null like String answer   and the null generated by the cancel buttonp  pMy sample code is belowp  precode    import javax.swing.      public class NullTest   public static void mainString[] args      Demonstrate behavior with doubles.     throwingDoubles      Demonstrate behavior with integers.     throwingInts        public static void throwingDoubles       Loops three times so you can test each option.     for int i  0 i lt 3 i              JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, Double TesternFirst time through click ok without entering text.nSecond time through click cancel.nFinally type in null to prove that this string is not treated as a null value.

Negative 4301 pWe have use GWT Platform with GWTP client and rest web services within GUICE container.

But this may not be suitable for complex JSON response string. Becuase you need to write lot of code to parse each item in JSON response and convert to a Java object. li liGWT AutobeanFactory approach  I dont know how best to use this We are using GWT 2.4, you do not have any complete example of using this approach at all. Everywhere, people say its an approach but no where we have detailed description on this. Few samples on google were from gwt older versions which were changed a lot in GWT 2.4.  Please somebody share a good example with GWT 2.4 and Autobean factory approach for JSON serdeser...li liJavaScript overlay types People say it is not the secured way to go. So I am bit hesitate whether we should use this or not. li ol  pMoreover, we are migrating from GWT to SmartGWT very soon. I hope, the rest call services with these should continue to work even in SmartGWT without any changes. Because SmartGWT also comes with a predefined format JSON rest support which we may not use as we already have built these services in general. p

Negative 4301 pWe are using the agile template for TFS 2010 and I am trying to set up a hierarchy of iterations that is different from the default one with Iteration 1, Iteration 2 and Iteration 3.  p  pI have two questions about the Excel file for the iteration backlog.  The problem most people encounter is that the Excel sheets which are generated by default do not work and cannot even be changed when they refer to queriesiterations that do not exist anymore.  I solved this problem by following the suggestions given in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6452747tfs2010openingcertainexcelreportsgiveserrortf80076this stackoverflow questiona also described a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combaaronbjorkarchive20100316unboundagileworkbooks.aspx relnofollowherea by downloading the original file from the template, linking it to our server and then uploading it to the shared documents folder. p  pEverything is working fine the Excel file correctly lists the work items of the query and such, except for the second sheet of the file, called Settings.  This sheet has two cells for entering the area and the iteration on which to filter. p  pFirst question out of curiosity what is the purpose of this filter, given that the area and iteration are already filtered in the query on which the file is based.p  pSecond question here is the real problem any value I enter into these fields is refused with Excel telling me that The value you entered is not valid.  There is a dropdown list for each cell, and it appears that these lists contain the only possible values for the cells.  The dropdown list for the area cell is empty and the one for the iteration cell lists one iteration, called Iteration 1.  This is confusing, since there is no such iteration in my project.  It sounds as if this is a remnant of the default setup.  So how do I correct thisp  pI did not find much on this subject online except for one guy in the comments of a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combaaronbjorkarchive20090518enablingtheiterationbacklogworkbookonanupgradedteamproject.aspx relnofollowthis posta who describes exactly the problem Im having but without a solution.

Negative 4301 pIve seen iOS apps that allow users to scroll around a view that is larger than the screen itself, without seeming to implement a UIScrollView mechanic. So for example, the actual image displayed on the screen is double the width of the screen, and the user can pan left and right to view all the content. Is this just a case of making the ViewControllers width twice that of the screen and allowing some kind of panning via gesture recognizers With what Im trying to do, it seems like this would be easier that implementing a UIScrollView...p

Negative 4301 pMy company is redoing our website over the next few months, going from a ColdFusion website to one written in Java.  I am just learning Java and I am curious as to how I can set application scope variables in a Java web application.  ColdFusion has the application.cfm file that holds variables that are accessible by all ColdFusion pagescomponents within the app.  Java obviously does not have a direct equivalent to that file, so I was wondering how to recreate something similar in Java.  I want to have one central place that all jsp pages, servlets, classes, etc. in the webapp can access.  p  pSo what is the best way to do something like thatp  pDoes anyone have any examples of something similar that they did  p  pShould application scope variables be placed in a class an xml file a jsp page something elsep  pIs it even feasible to have application scope variables a in java webappp  pExample It would be a place that holds say the path to an images folder, so in individual JSP pages or classes or whatever would need acces to that images folder, you could reference the application scope variable for that path instead of writing it out in each place.  Then if for some reason we needed to move the location of that images folder, we would just change the path variable in the one location and not have to update 20 places that reference that images folder.p  pI have had trouble finding any information on this type of thing in my research online, which is why I am asking about it here.  I know it is a lot to ask for an explanation to this type of thing, but I figured I would ask and see what type of responses I could get.p  pThank you for any help you can provide about this topic.p

What I am trying to accomplish is to get a finished product of SPTRF3,SPTRF1,SPTRF4,SPTHP4 from the array above, either in another array or string.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 4301 pThis is my first post. I started coding when considering a career swap two months ago and am working on a Tetris clone. Ive implemented most of the core features, but cannot get the game to refresh continually with an after loop. p  pIm using Tkinter to produce my Gui and am trying out event oriented programming. p  pMy understanding is that codeafterTime, Eventcode from codeTkintercode should schedule whatever the codeEventcode callback function is to occur after a delay specified by codeTimecode. I think that the code is supposed to continue executing subsequent items after this. p  pMy frame refresh function codegame.updateBoardcode does most of the necessary events for tetris to work, then calls itself using after. I call it once when initializing an instance of the game. p  pInstead of proceeding to codemainloopcode, the codegame.updateboardcode function calls itself via codeaftercode indefinitely. p  pI suspect that it is not behaving how I thought codeaftercode worked which would be to continue to execute the script until the specified delay occurs. I think it is waiting for the callback to terminate to continue. p  pI tried to find a resource on this but could not. p  pIf you have suggestions for fixing this question, the attached code, or for coding in general, I am very happy to hear them This is a learning process and Ill gladly try pretty much anything you suggest.p  pHere is the relevant portion of the codep  precodeclass game     def

Negative 4301 pHi I am trying to build a realtime multiplayer game using node.js and socket.io.p  pNow, implementing itself in terms of coding wont be so much of a problem, but coming from a traditional http requestresponse web programming model, I have no idea how expensive this would be in terms of traffic and server load. Basically during a game, a players browser should track realtime mouse input events and keep broadcasting them to all other players in the same game.p  pHeres an example, lets say my avatar follows around my mouse pointer on the screen, and it should be broadcasted to rest of the players on the screen in realtime. I would do something likep  precode client side document.onmousemove, functionevent     io.emitcoordinate, x event.pageX, y event.pageY  codepre  pand on the serverp  precode server side io.sockets.onconnection, functionsocket     ...     socket.oncoordinate, functioncoordinate         socket.getusername, functionerr, username             socket.broadcast.emitmove, username username, coordinatecoordinate                   ...  codepre  pI think this should work, but this requires the browser emitting several events per second to the server, which subsequently should broadcast them to rest of the players in the same game, and I am worried about the implication of this. One thing though is that the size of each fragment of data being transmitted is not that large basically its just an x and y coordinate. If this is too expensive, no matter how great this game is, I dont think I can ship it. Could anyone enlighten me Thank you.p  p[EDIT] To clarify, I am not asking about how to make this architecture more efficient. I just want to know if this type of system is realistic enough in terms of system load and maintenance cost For ordinary web services I can just estimate the cost by looking at page view numbers but websocket is an entirely new field I am not aware of, so I wanted to ask.p

Negative 4301 pI need to read the current directory in Windows 7 which is in a different locale than the one that is currently used. So I thought of using GetCurrentDirectoryW since it is unicode compatible, with wchart. However, I need to use an existing API, so I need to convert this to char. For this purpose I used the wcstombs function. However, the conversion is not happening properly. Included below is the code that I usedp  precode    wchart wcurrentDir[MAXPATH  100]     char currentDir[MAXPATH  100]     GetCurrentDirectoryWMAXPATH, wcurrentDir     wcstombs currentDir, wcurrentDir, MAXPATH  100     printfs n, currentDir codepre  pThe current directory that Im in is C. When the conversion is done, Only the C part of the full path is converted to char properly. The other characters are not, they are junk values. What is the problem in this approach that Im using How can I rectify thisp  pThank youp

Negative 4301 pIm new to Spring data JPA and am trying to understand how to best use it with QueryDSL. Without QueryDSL, I would be able to simply create any queries in my SpringData interface with an Query annotation.p  pIn order to have the same experience using QueryDSL, from what I can see, I need to either create my own custom repository implementation and have my repo interface extend my custom implementation interface or put all my QueryDSL queries at a service layer which wraps my repo. p  pIn the first case, I lose the ability to use any of the SD autogenerated methods ex findAllQueryDSL predicate  in my custom repo since I dont have access to the actual repo object, and in the second case I am putting query logic at the service layer instead of at the repo layer.p  pNeither solution sounds particularly attractive to me.  Is there a 3rd way that is more appropriate  Or am I misunderstanding how to properly use QueryDSL and Spring Datap  pThanksp  pEricp

Negative 4301 pThere is a asp.net driven site where I can login and fill a form to place a order after a succesful login.

Negative 4301 pTheres going to be a lot of code in this, and for that I apologize, but the very problem is that Im having difficulty stepping my way through this program and ascertaining where this thing is creating the sections of the UITableView.p  pThis started off as a table view exercise from iOS Programming  The Big Nerd Ranch Guide and I decided I wanted to explore this more, so I created some images in Illustrator and went to town.  p  pIve successfully createdp  ul lipthe UIViewpli lipthe UITableView and UITableViewCells in ONE SINGLE SECTION, that are filled with Items, which are just randomly generated strings, as in the book example.  random adjective, random noun, random serial number, etc.pli lipmiscellaneous buttons that change to a highlighted state when you tap thempli lipa footer after the first and only section that displays a few more buttons that seem to work finepli ul  pAll Im trying to do now, as an exercise, is take half of these randomly generated string items, stick em in table view cells, and place them in strongsection 2strong of the table view.  Seems like a relatively straightforward task, but I cannot figure out wherehow to do this.  Ive read the documentation and I think I may need to implement the insertSectionswithRowAnimation method, but I cant find an example online anywhere that gives me a clue as to how to implement it in a way that makes sense in my program.p  pTo shortcut thingshopefullyI believe the problems going to lie in the ItemsViewController.m file, located at the bottom of this post.  The ItemStore class is just an array called allItems which holds the randomly generated string items I described before.  Nothing important to what Im trying to do seems to be happening in the AppDelegate files either.  Any help would be appreciated.

Negative 4301 pI have some animation which needs to appear on screen at very specific timings, these are stored in SQLite database. What I am planning to do is use nstimer to keep time and pop the animation when the specific time is reached. p  pIm thinking of using an NSTimer to count for the duration of the sound file and animation then when certain points are reached pop an on screen animation. The problem is the set timing are like this 55.715000 seconds so are very accurate and these need to sync with an audio track that will be played with the animation.p  pFirstly is this even possible, secondly how can i compare such specific timings the problem i seem to be facing is the code cant run quick enough and the time jumps more than .001 of a second.p  pI have no knowledge of openGLES or Cocos2d and learning these is not really feasible for the time scales.p
Negative 4301 pIm writing a test suite for a webapp using TestNG and Selenium WebDriver.p  pWhat i need is to run all methods of the test class multiple times for different authenticated users data is pulled out at runtime from a DB. So i need to pass a data to the class with data provider, that supplies credentials of all users, then for each user i need to create a web driver for the purity of the experiment and authenticate with supplied credentials in codeBeforeClasscode method, run all codeTestcode methods of the class and make an codeAfterClasscode tear down closing web driver.p  pHow can i do thatp  pMy attempts to do this are here a hrefhttpsgist.github.com4246674 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.com4246674ap  pAttempt1 was to place a codeTestdataProvidergetUsersIdAndNamecode on class. It doesnt work because as it turned out codeTestdataProvidercode on the class doesnt mean that all methods of the class should be invoked with the supplied data. The result was that method wasnt invoked at all because there is no data to pass to it arguments. And i get strange test report where this method is marked as passed with execution time of 0 sec. It is a Maven project opened in NetBeans, if this makes sense.p  pDoes codeTestdataProvidercode on the class means anything at allp  pAttempt2 was to add dataProvider on the codeTestcode annotation of the method. It doesnt work because this means that test method is invoked twice during the single class run. The result was that at the second time it fails because it tries to repeat the test while web driver wasnt reinitialized browser already renders another page.p  pAlso there are disadvantages of the first and second attempt that log in itself is done in test method rather that in codeBeforeClasscode method because i know no way to supply it with data from data provider.p  pAttempt3 was a desperate attempt to combine codeBeforeClasscode and codeTestcode on the single method.  It doesnt work because codeBeforeClasscode also demands codeParameterscode if an annotated method has a parameter list. The result is that this method is invoked three times first time as a class setup when it fails because of the above reason and two times because of the data provider when it succeeds.p  pThen i found out that TestNG doesnt provide a way to invoke all class methods multiple times with different data a hrefhttpcomments.gmane.orggmane.comp.java.testng.user864 relnofollowhttpcomments.gmane.orggmane.comp.java.testng.user864ap  pI have two other ideas of how can i archive the same effect.p  pIdea4 is to place a codeTestdataProvidercode on each test method, each method will perform an authentication and codeisAuthenticatedcode test by itself and then perform its own test. Ineffective and ugly.p  pIdea5 that looks like the best affordable one is to mark with a codeTestcode only one method that will aggregate all other test methods it receives data from data provider, performs authentication by given user, then runs isAuthenticated test and all other necessary tests. In this case codeBeforeClasscode and codeAfterClasscode are only setting up and tearing down web driver. This approach has disadvantage that im loosing ability to use codeBeforeMethodcode and codeAfterMethodcode but this is affordable to me looks like i will not need them.p  pIs there a better way to archive same effectp  pSorry for long message.p  pThanks in advance.p

Any ideasp

Negative 4301 pThis is a subtle problem I have a custom tableview cell with a slider and a segmented control.

So all is good.p  pHowever, when the user does not go through with the delete and instead taps out of bounds, the slider immediately springs back to its full width before the delete button animation swipe finishes.

Negative 4301 pRequireJS allows one to load libraries from a CDN. In case the CDN is down, one can also have a backup option where the file can be located some where else in this case, we assume it is located locally. This is all done in the paths object.

But if the backup option is not included in the optimised version, then how will optimised code cope if the CDN goes downp  pThanks in advance for the answers.p

Im using Dreamweaver CS6 here for the fluid layouts and the nav bar itself is inside a fluid div called navigation which has its width set to 100.p  pNow the header image above it is also in a fluid div called header with its width also set to 100. Before I noticed the nav problem I was having problems with getting the image centred until I came across a question on here I think which lead me to the solution of creating a displayblock rule for the img and then using the marginauto trick to center it.p  pHowever this  or anything else Ive tried doesnt seem to work on the nav bar. I admit i took a most of the construction from a number of tutorials on the web but I am quite proud of the result  if only I could get it to sizeposition properly when I expand the browser widthp  pIdeally Id like it to remain a static size similar to the header image and to be centred similarly too. If this was doable Id also then like to be able to see more of the background image at the sides too, like in the original home page at a hrefhttpmassagecamden.co.uk relnofollowhttpmassagecamden.co.uka but I relise the marginauto on the gridContainer probably wont do this by virtue of the fluid gridp  pAnyone got any ideas where Im going wrong Pleasep  pmany thanks Craig.p

Negative 4301 pThis one is going to be a bit complicated for me to explain without posting a ton of code, but Ill try my best. Im writing an ingame console which requires me to bind both normal free functions and methods of instances to the console so that they can be called using a simple key word. Every methodfunction the console can be bound to requires an sfString parameter, and returns an sfString. Im using SFML for the game, and sf is SFMLs namespacep  p[Note All 4 classes Console, CFunctionInterface, CFunction, and CMethod are all declared in the same file console.h.

When I want to call a function, this map will be iterated through and if the input function name matches one of the keys, the value of that key will be called.

So limit by rows will increase my total runtime a lot.p  pIve tried statement.setFetchSize50, but it seemed not working as I expected.p  pAny suggestions will be really appreciated Thanksp
Negative 4301 pNeed your suggestionsadvice on a scenario I am stuck into. I am developing an iPhone Application which has 1215 videos. User can download any video and then play it on his iPhone. The problem is that I am writing the videos to the documents directory. It works well for small videos50 mb but when the bigger ones are choosen250 mb the app crashes, due to low memory warnings.p  hr  pI know that the app is crashing due to increase in memory footprint. Is there any alternate way to download large files more efficientlyin chunks with less memory utilization Otherwise I am thinking to give download option only for small videos and only streaming option for large size videos.p

Negative 4301 pas I had some serious performance issues with my mobile webapplication, I wanted to provide my solution and ask for further tips amp tricks to keep the performance of KineticJS up, especially on mobile devices...p  pIn my case, on desktopbrowser everything seemed fine, but the application crashed mobile devices and their browsers. After a while, I found out, that the height and width of the browser or better the viewport was much higher than the original device resolution. To fix this issue I simply added the following line in my codeindex.htmlcodep  precodeltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1.0, userscalablenogt codepre  pSo I would be very glad to hear, if anyone of you has found some other ways keep performance up, or if there are any special performancekillers to avoid when using KineticJS.  p

Negative 4301 pI have a LogManager that uses some async methods to add to and read from an asyncobservablecollection both encounter the same error. However when running I sometimes have a null value added to this collection and I cant find out where it is coming from.p  pI tried add breakpoints on the method Log and the async method with a simple if, but there I dont get any null values. The only place I encounter them is when Im trying to save the logs to a file, in which they are already added to the collection..p  pAt first I thought it was because I was calling the function too fast it is in a while true loop, that can be canceled though because of items being added to the collection while I was retrieving values from them.p  pRight now I got it partially fixed by removing the null object from the collection when I encounter one, though I find it disturbing as it might be a Log I shouldnt be missing.p  pIll continue searching, if anyone notices something or want me to add other methods I used to understand better please let me know, any help is appreciatedp  pHere is my asynchronous SaveLogs function and SaveLoopp  precode    private static Task

Negative 4301 pFirst, let me be clear about what I mean by the declared type. Assume SuperBoss is a superclass of the class Boss.p  precodeSuperBoss mrBond  new Boss codepre  pSuperBoss is the declared type, and Boss is the actual type.p  pPersonally, I think the declared type is changed at runtime due to the following runtime exceptionp  precodeSuperBoss mrWayne  new SuperBoss BossmrWayne.randomMethod   Exception java.lang.ClassCastException SuperBoss cannot be cast to Boss codepre  pI know this may seem trivial, but Im going to be tutoring next quarter, and I dont want to teach the students the wrong thing.  And my professor and her assistant this quarter did not agree with each other on this subject.  My professor believes that casting does indeed completely change the declared type at runtime for a single statement. The T.A. strongly believed that at runtime, the cast is merely checked, but doesnt actually change the declared type.                                                                                             p

How would I let it know that the section has been removed and thats why 4 rows have been moved to the first section. That would stop the NSInternalInconsistencyException error.p  pEdit App only crashes if there is a section below the section being removed. Which is why more rows are added improperly. In that case, when I relaunch the app, the section was successfully removed. All seems normal.p  pI have resolved the issue. First of all, I didnt fully update the database when i ended the updates. But even then it wouldnt work. So I just used a delay of 0.1 seconds to delete the section by using performSelectorwithObjectafterDelay and it workedp

Negative 4301 pOn a table such asp  precodeCREATE TABLE foo ..., k1 INTEGER, k2 INTEGER codepre  pI would like to index for a query such asp  precodeSELECT  FROM foo WHERE k1 BETWEEN a AND b AND k2 BETWEEN x AND y codepre  pIt seems to me that creating a BTREE index on k1, k2 should do the trick, but EXPLAIN says otherwise.  It says that it will use a keylen of 4 to match for k1, but it doesnt really benefit when matching for k2 other than having narrowed things down in the table somewhat.  But if k1s range is wide, then theres still a lot of work to do constraining for k2.p  pAnd one MySQL Performance Blog article may indicate that it shouldnt because once the interval range is utilized, it just scans for the rest a hrefhttpwww.mysqlperformanceblog.com200909123waysmysqlusesindexes relnofollowhttpwww.mysqlperformanceblog.com200909123waysmysqlusesindexesap  pIs there any other indexing scheme or multiple table scheme that can make this query optimalp  pI thought to use partitioning where I would partition on k1.  The docs say that the optimizer takes this into account.  If I created many partitions, and the data was fairly distributed, then things the linear scans would be better if the engine only has to access a small number of partitions.  But, A Partitioning isnt enabled on my particular mysql server and I dont have rights to change that  and B I actually have 3 BETWEEN statements in my actual application.  So partitioning would only help the first BETWEEN expression with still two to go.p  pIt seems like this would be a fairly common situation that would arise and be in need of indexing, but I havent much seen the question asked quite in this way out there.p  pThanks in advance for any helpp

Negative 4301 pThe client is using a WYSIWYG editor to generate HTML like the following. Normally, there should be no margin or padding for the paragraph elements. However, if the client wants there to be a line break, he will press enter twice in the editor, which will generate an empty paragraph element. This empty paragraph element should have a margintop of 15px.p  pSo basically, heres an example of the HTML generated. The margin for the paragraph elements with content in them should be 0, but the margin for the paragraph tags that are empty should be margintop15pxp  precodeltpgtParagraph 1 content goes hereltpgt ltpgtParagraph 2 content goes hereltpgt ltpgtltpgt ltpgtParagraph 3 content goes hereltpgt ltpgtParagraph 4 content goes hereltpgt ltpgtParagraph 5 content goes hereltpgt ltpgtltpgt ltpgtltpgt ltpgtParagraph 6 content goes hereltpgt codepre  pI know this is an odd request, and the only reason we are dealing with this issue is because of the much hated WYSIWYG editor, but Im wondering if theres any way in CSS to accomplish this, or if I need to resort to JavascriptJQuery If so, how would I do it most efficiently in JavascriptJQueryp

Negative 4301 pI have a small photography portfolio site that I use to share pictures with my relatives. The photos are laid out every 1000px or so in a vertical scrolling page. An example is here a hrefhttppavelrozman.comphotoeventsjamison relnofollowhttppavelrozman.comphotoeventsjamisona . Right now I have a small Javascript that lets you scroll 800px with the arrow keys. This is okay, but its inconsistent because of varying image heights. I read an article on The Verge, and it has exactly what Im looking for but I have no idea how to implement it because I know nothing about JavascriptjQuery.

Negative 4301 pI am using a UITableView to display some data in my iOS app. The problem is, the codecell.textLabel.textcode and codecell.detailTextLabel.textcode is variable.

The user keeps the report open, then goes back to the report list again.

Negative 4301 blockquote   pI apologize if there is a similar question already out there.  There   are several questions about scoring hands but I dont need that.p      pThe project I am working on takes in 10 cards and needs to report the   best possible 5card hand found straight, high card, flush   etc..  Luckily what the actual hand of cards is is irrelevant, I just   need a name.p      pIve already parsed and sorted all the cards out and have the tests   for all the possible hands laid out.  All I need now is a convenient   way to store the hands.  My mad method is as follows, in pseudocode   termsp      pstrongI want to have a dynamic list horizontally that I can populate with the NUMBER values of the cards, in order from highest to lowest.  For   example, Q J T 7 4 2 1.  T is 10.  Duplicates of values will be   ignored.  Next, I want each of those values to have, underneath, a   list of the suits of each value that exist in the deck.  For example,   J will have a sublist with the values D H to represent that I have   a Jack of Diamonds and a Jack of Hearts.strongp      pI believe this to be the most elegant way to deal with these cards,   since most poker hands deal with only values and this way I dont have   to worry about cards of the same value in a row for say the straight   test.  Then the two tests that emdoem deal with suit can easily be   tested for by referring to the values under the keys.  p      pTake a deep breath, almost there.p      pSo an instance of Lookup appears to be perfect  It has the exact one   key to multiple values structure that I want.  However, it doesnt   allow me to add the suits as I come to them.  I have to add them all   at once or not at all since the lists are immutable after entry.p      pSo I eitherp      ol   lihave to find all the suits at once before I even make the Lookupli   liSomehow add values to the Lookup lists orli   liUse something else.li   ol      pAny ideas on any of thesep blockquote  h2UPDATEh2  pstrongTLDR SPARKNOTES VERSION  How can I add more values to the keys inside of a Lookupstrongp  pemIMOPRTANT NOTEemThe output of this program should be a string containing the name of the highest hand possible, for example four of a kind, two pair or high card.p  pI found one solution which I unfortunately lost the link to and cant find again where they suggested recreating the entire Lookup with the new list.  It may just be me but I find that solution to be very... ugly...  Anyway several other solutions I have explored or tested are top  hr  h2METHOD 1h2  pRoll through and populate another array with the suits associated with each value.  Basically in actual pseudocode this time p  ol liCreate an array of ArrayLists array 1 li liIterate through a sorted string array of cards array 2li liFor each cardli liTake the char at string index [1] representing the suit and add into the ArrayList in array 1 at the index number extracted from string index [0].li ol  pThis way I have the list of values with associated suits that I wanted.  And the list of suits is the minimal size to boot, making iteration through that easier later.  With some extra steps I can even make the umbrella array an ArrayList and populate it with the card values in order so there are no gaps and no duplicate numbers.  This will leave me with a jagged array of what I want.  To be clear, this is not a homework assignment.  However, it IS from a coding class project my roommate completed in the past which is why I have the constrictions and requirements I have.  Someone else I asked told me SE gets plagued by these kinds of homework questions around this time, so I understand your skepticism.  This is a personal project because I want to learn C all I know is Java right now, and I like the sound of parameter pointer passing in C methods, which Java does not do.p  pIf it WERE for a grade I would end there because it works.  But I dont really like arraylists of arraylists, they seem messy to me.  So I want to know if there is another method.p  hr  h2METHOD 2h2  pI also considered simply dealing with duplicates that inevitably appear.  For example, here is my test for a straightp  precode for int i  0 i lt 5 i                      int counter  0             for int j  i j lt i  4 j                              int secondCard  getValuecardsArray[j  1]                 int firstCard  getValuecardsArray[j]                 if secondCard  firstCard                                      break                                  if secondCard  firstCard  1                                      counter                     if counter  4                                              isStraight  true                         return straight                                                             codepre  pThis code does not work.  It needs some tweaks somewhere or other to work completely but I want to analyze if it is worth it before I try to fix it.  It DOES accurately test for a straight, though.  Also a couple notes firstCard and secondCard are there for readability and debug purposes, and isStraight is there so that I dont reinvent the wheel later when I test for a straight flush.p  pThis nested loop will iterate through all the cards up till the 5th card since you cant have a straight out of ten sorted cards with less than 5 cards and then check the next five cards as you would expect.  If during this iteration I encounter a duplicate entry it means that its the same card of another suit and I simply break.  What SHOULD happen as a result of this one statement is that now we have incremented our second iteration by one to check the next card instead of the current one.  The count of inorder cards that we have will stay the same so that a list like  1D 2D 3S 3H 4D 5C  will skip over the second 3 when finding the straight.  Despite the break I was actually quite pleased with the elegance of this solution, whether I had a right to be or not.p  pIt all goes back to the flaws of using a simple array of strings cards, which is what my code is tailored to right now.  And I hate fixing issues, Id rather avoid them.  Maybe Im being unnecessarily picky but Im learning along the way.p  hr  h2METHOD 3h2  pMy consideration of the weaknesses of an array of strings lead me to Dictionaries, which looked attractive.  It can easily be made to hold my values in order, and easy to find if I have a certain suit for a key TryGet, all in a neat, tailormade package.  Creating multiple array lists and doing things like find index of my value  array1[index].Addvalue would be replaced by Dictionary.Addvalue, suit.  But I can only add a suit to a key at the point of creation.  I couldnt make a 2 key and add S and then when I find out the next card is a 2D add a D under the 2 key.  Dictionary just doesnt support that, or even adding multiple values at all.  I can make a dictionary of lists, but I still cant edit the list since Dictionaries are mostly query data structures.  Lookups support multiple values per key but still cannot be changed after the initial Add.  Again I could recreate the entire lookup or dictionary to add a suit and keep everything in order.  But to me that seems like rebuilding the whole bridge because this one cable is too long and I dont have an industrial able cutter.  Its a problem that SHOULD have an easier solution, like maybe go and GET some cutters import a class maybe.p  hr  h2CONCLUSIONh2  pSince you suggest that my needs are no different than what a hand scoring system could deliver leads me to another questionp  pAre hand scores directly tied to certain hands  Like I mentioned earlier the result I want is The best hand you can make is a full house not This player has the highest hand.  So can I calculate the highest scoring hand and extrapolate a full house from that score  If so then I guess this is all unnecessary code, but I would kind of like to solve this anyway in that case.p  pAs I wrote this edit it dawned on me that this is basically a vanity issue.  I dont like the solution I have.  I also dont want to use the accepted solution table lookup because that is not a coding project that is a copypaste project.  I would greatly appreciate any input.p

Im not sure how this can be the case.

This means I should only get the codeUnboundLocalErrorcode if codeusercode is undefined in the function, all functions wrapping it, and globally. This is plainly not the case here.p  pAnother source of confusion is that Im able to see using the Werkzeug debug console that my other parameter emisem defined in this scope. How can one parameter be defined and the other parameter, which is taken in by the decorator function, be undefined at the same point in the program flow I thought maybe this was a quirk that only affected parameters with a default value, so I switched it over to a required parameter and manually passed in codeNonecode, but this still produced the errorp  pWhy is codeusercode out of scope when the other parameter is in scope How can I fix this decoratorp

Negative 4301 pI have a windows service that often fails when I restart my computer and I do not know exactly where. I surround everything on a try catch block and I never hit the catch blockp  pAnyways I think it is a time problem. If I make my process wait 15 seconds then it works fine. The service connects to a web service on a local network. What is the correct approach of initializing my service. Some computers are faster than others so one computer might need a 5 second delay and others may require a 25 seconds delay. What will be the most appropiate way of solving this problemp  pwhat I am doing right now is on a while loop I try to connect to a local web service hosted on a the local network. If I am not able to connect I try again on the next 30 seconds. I am logging my data to a file and for some reason my service keeps running and it throws no exceptions.Every 30 seconds I should see a new line saying attempting to connect on my log but I dont get that line Also I get no exceptions If I go see the service on Task Manager,  Windows 7 says that the service is running. How should I solve this problemp

Negative 4301 pWhen I run my code in debug mode in Eclipse, Im able to find where the code breaks down, but an exception is not being shown on the council.

Negative 4301 pI am making a Chinese blog using django. I write everything I can control in Chinese, such as post text, blog title, blog navigation, and the label tags of the comment and contactme forms. The only things I cannot control are the form submitting errors such as This field is required., Enter a valid email address.. Because I use django comment framework and form library to make my comment form and contactme form, I dont know how to replace that English version to Chinese version.p  pSo I resort to django internationalization. Following the django document, I add some translation strings to the forms original html files that django provides to me, likep  precode for error in field.errors      ltligt trans error ltligt  endfor    for error in form.sender.errors      ltligt trans error ltligt  endfor  codepre  pThen I make message files in my project root directory and add django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware to the MIDDLEWARECLASSES setting. p  pIn the .po file, the constant strings have record, like  trans Welcome to my site  has the recordp  precodemsgid Welcome to my site. msgstr  codepre  pBut the variable content like  trans error  has no record. p  pI still go on, and reload my blog. I saw This field is required. is translated to Chinese, both in the comment form and contactme form, but Enter a valid email address is still in English. I try manually adding a new record, likep  precodemsgid Enter a valid email address. msgstr XXXXXXX codepre  pto .po file, but no effect. p  pWhy django translate some error message and ignore other error message p  pIf django cannot translate some string automatically or I just dont like the translation django automatically provides to me, can I provide my own translation to it If so, where do I put the translated string, as .po file has no corresponding recordp

Negative 4301 pI have a very mysterious problem.p  pI am somehow not uploading my new app versions correctly even if everything it seemingly correct. I determine this by download the new versions and seeing nothing has changed.p  p1 Before release I test my changes are included and working on devicedebug  deviceadhoc.p  p2 I then build and deploy for app store. Before uploading my .ipa file into Application Loader I make sure the strong.ipa file has just been generatedstrong. I then select it and the uploadverification process goes find without errros and some days later I get a message new app has been released...p  p3 I then uninstall my existing app just to make sure and download and install the new app version from appstore  it is still the same. This is driving me nuts. I think I have tried to eliminate potential places where I could have errored, but somehow somewhere something is going terrible wrong for me. This is a fairly recent new problem  never had it in the past.p  pI am hoping if somehow can think of ways I can diagnose at what steps this is going wrong... I know it must be me that have an error somewhere. I recognize when something looks like a Doh thing, but I believe I have tried a varity of methods to pinpoint it.p  pI have also tried clear out out scratchtemp directory before building  deploying. However, I am still wondering. Could it be some cachepath setting somewhere that makes Delphi compile incorrect app executable only when doing release builds I have of course also long time ago deleted all old directory paths that could contain earlier builds, but still...p

Negative 4301 pI am using EF5 in my current project and I will upgrade it to EF6. I know that EF has an internal query cache. This is all good, but I think it wont be enough for my needs. I want to use a cache server like memcache or redis. I know that Nhibernate have some very nice appenders like memcache. I find NCache with a quick internet search. But its documentation and samples seems outdated. So Im not sure if I can use it. Are there any stable cache providers for EF5 or EF6p

I have an assignment in my JavaScript class that requires that I create a nag counter that will alert the user on their fifth visit that they should register. Then I must do this for every fifth visit until the user A Gets annoyed and stops using my website, or B they register. At that time, I have to delete the cookie that holds the counter and the nag and replace it with a landing page that welcomes the user back to the website, displaying their registration credentials. p  pI know that this can be done, I have seen it numerous time. The problem that I am having is the fact that I am so new to JavaScript that feel like I am in way over my head. I have spent about 2 hours combing through my textbook, as well as Google, and I have not found any answers. I have asked my Instructor and fellow students for help but have yet to receive any. Te last time my instructor advised me, she said Try Googling it. p  pI do not even know where to begin this assignment. I appreciate any help you may or may not be able to offer. I am not looking for a handout, or for anyone to do my assignment for me. I assure you I am in fact trying to learn something, but I feel this assignment it too much. p

Negative 4301 pIm relatively new to Rails, having written only one app so far.

Based on my research, this approach also allows me to fully customise the registration procedure for each user category. For example, I could allow Customers to register with their Facebook account using OmniAuth, but not extend this option to my Providers. And of course Super Admins wont be registerable at all. I understand that each user will have separate login pages, which is not an issue for me it is in fact desirable.p  pHaving different models, especially for Admin also allows me to refactor with ease later, in case I do need to implement additional roles.p  pstrongThe Questionstrongp  pIs the design above as simple as I can make it No battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy.

Negative 4301 pSorry in advance, Im not at my computer so I cant provide code I have a voxel based game, and I wanted to add in transparent textures, namely glass. I realized that transparent textures would throw things off looking through other blocks, so I used my shaders to remove any alpha components lower than the alpha value of the glass texture. Currently, the glass has an alpha of 0.26 coordinates range from 0  1, and it works fine. But, if I want to add some transparency to the glass instead of removing all transparency, I run into my old issue where you can see through the blocks behind the glass.p  pI read in a few places that I would need to sort my geometry from front to back. Does this still pertain to my situation even after using shaders I use display lists, for each chunk in my world, should I keep two lists, one for opaque blocks and one for transparent So when I render, I would do one pass and render the opaque lists, and then do another render pass, and render the chunks inversely and render the transparent list p  pOr is there a better way to do thisp

Negative 4301 pSo I am measuring some latencies for how long it takes it execute an add instruction on my machine to get an estimate of CPI. I first wrote a linear version that implemented a serial add interleaved to take advantage of pipeline. I then took the same code and wrapped the additions in a loop and reevaluated it. I understand the effects of loop level parallelism but I dont get how it would be faster than the serial version which should still implement DLP. I thought maybe it was because the loop unrolling version is taking more advantage of the pipeline through register renaming so there is a higher IPC but I also tried increasing the interleaving of the linear version and it didnt really increase the performance. I would think that branch mispredictions would cause the looped version to be quite a bit slower but thats not the case. Any thoughtsp  precodeinclude lttime.hgt include ltstdio.hgt  define ONE asm volatile add 20, eax add 10, ecx define FIVE ONE ONE ONE ONE ONE define TWOFIVE FIVE FIVE FIVE FIVE FIVE define HUNDO TWOFIVE TWOFIVE TWOFIVE TWOFIVE define THOUSAND  HUNDO HUNDO HUNDO HUNDO HUNDO HUNDO HUNDO HUNDO HUNDO HUNDO define TENTHOUSAND THOUSAND THOUSAND THOUSAND THOUSAND THOUSAND THOUSAND THOUSAND THOUSAND THOUSAND THOUSAND define HUNDREDK  TENTHOUSAND TENTHOUSAND TENTHOUSAND TENTHOUSAND TENTHOUSAND TENTHOUSAND TENTHOUSAND TENTHOUSAND TENTHOUSAND TENTHOUSAND define MILLION  HUNDREDK HUNDREDK HUNDREDK HUNDREDK HUNDREDK HUNDREDK HUNDREDK HUNDREDK HUNDREDK HUNDREDK  static inline unsigned long long rdtscvoid     unsigned end, start     asm volatilerdtsc  astart, dend     return unsigned long longstart  unsigned long longendltlt32  int main     double CPI  0     long long start, end     long long clocks     int i     startrdtsc     fori0 i lt 10000 i         HUNDREDK          endrdtsc     calculate the time elapsed in ns per access     clocks  endstart     CPI  clocksdouble20000010000 divide by Number of instructions  loop      printfCycles Per Instruction lf, Clocks Ldn, CPI, clocks  codepre  pThe difference between the two is pretty significant. The linear version has a IPC of about .2 and the looped version has an IPC of about 4. And yes I remembered to change the amount of instructions I was dividing by when evaluating the two p  pMaybe there is some confusion about the way I am doing this because file size is not the issue. I am simply removing the loop. The two process a different amount of instructions, but I also change the value I am dividing by at the end. The end with the same compiled size.p  pUPDATE Thanks for the responses. There were a couple issues. The first being the way I was doing my measurements the IF time for one version was being amortized across the loop while the other wasnt. I ran some more code and interleaving of instructions from the Loop Level parallelism was greater in loop than in the serial version. The serial version still has some Write after Write dependencies that are not being renamed and are causing stalls to the pipeline.p

Negative 4301 pI hope this is an easy question.  I will try to be clear on what I am trying to accomplish.  Below is just a small snippet of what my XML file looks like.  What I am trying to do is see if the  element structure exists.  If so, the code proceeds.  I then try to look through all of the  elements and if child element test is False, then I would like to get the text of the id element.  The following code I have will work if the  element is before the  element.  I want to make sure that whatever order ID is list in before or after the  that I get the appropriate child id belonging to the appropriate  parent.

Negative 4301 pThis may be a naive question. But I hope not. p  pIm working on an JS web app eventually to be placed into PhoneGap. Its a one page game.p  pIts a word game so I have a few variables that are largeish arrays to store dictionary content in for look ups.p  pMy questionsp  ol lipIs there any rule of thumb as to what is too big of an array to keep in memory My biggest array is 3000 items consisting of small text strings. Seems to run fine. Im guessing thats not considered all that big. pli lipIf it is too big or when a variable is too big is there a proper way in JS to unload that variable from memory until its needed later pli ol  pI have a hunch that my realworld example of 3000 item array isnt a cause for concern and is me worrying too much about microoptimization but I am still interested from a general theoretical standpoint When variables are too large to practically keep in memory, is there a proper way to loadunload them as needed in JSp  pUPDATEp  pIm thinking now this question is perhaps naive the more I think about it. p  pIs it fair to say that if I declare a variable, no matter where in my JS code, it, by default, is already in memory as all my JS has to be in memory to run. As such, there really is no loadingunloading of variables. Theyre either there or they are notp

Negative 4301 pWhen using the reconnect true in database.yml, Rails will automatically reconnect to the database if the connection drops. However, Rails appears to be completely ignorant when the reconnect happens in the middle of a transaction, with the effect that the earlier portion of the transaction before the reconnect is automatically rolled back by the database when the connection drops, but all the queries generated by Rails after the reconnect are simply executed on the new connection  outside of any transaction I would expect an exception to be raised in case the reconnect happens in the middle of a transaction, anyone knows of any patchesgems that do this p

Negative 4301 pIve already opened my image and can access the individual pixels RGB values, but what Im trying to do now is apply a function to the RGB values of each of the pixels individually.

The problem is that WMDRAWITEM is getting called only when my mouse is on the dialog window, which is not really a problem, if there would be a way for advice the main dialog to handle it when I want it. I tried with InvalidateRect, but it is not making WMDRAWITEM, but WMCTLCOLORBTN.p  pSo, my question is  Is there any way for let WMDRAWITEM being handled even if the mouse is out of the dialog  OR Is there any way for advice the main dialog that it should handle again WMDRAWITEM, evne if the mouse is out of the dialogp  pThanks alot for taking your time in replyng me.p
Negative 4301 pI read several posts about concurrency problems but Im still unsure about something.  Can I say that when using synchronized, I get volatile functionality for free, because when the lock on an object will be released, the next thread always reads the modified object. With volatile, the value of an object is immediately reflected to other threads. But when I use synchronized, there is no possibility to immediately reflect it due to the lock on the object. When the lock is released, only then another thread may access it. So I dont have to care about reflecting the value immediately to other threads. Do I understand this rightp  pstrong[UPDATE]strongbr Example prints always 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 without volatile.p  precodepackage main  public class Counter      public static long count  0   public class UseCounter implements Runnable      public void increment              synchronized this                             Counter.count             System.out.printCounter.count                       Override     public void run              increment         increment         increment        public class DataRace      public static void mainString args[]              UseCounter c  new UseCounter          Thread t1  new Threadc         Thread t2  new Threadc         Thread t3  new Threadc          t1.start         t2.start         t3.start       codepre

Negative 4301 pIm working on an interactive commandline tool. The tool shows a prompt, and the user can enter commands and parameters which are being processed. After a command was executed, thhere is a new prompt and the user can proceed entering commands. It is very similar to gdb debugger, when used in cli mode. The tool is mostly written in C, with some wrappers for using C librarys.p  pId like to attach a GUI QT would be my first choice here to my tool, however, Im not sure how to do this. If you search the internet, many Unix developers prefer to strictly separate back and frontend. So, Im thinking about making the GUI a separate executable, which just uses the functionality of my command line tool.p  pWhats the best way to achieve this Should I use interproces communication with pipes or sockets gdb, for example, uses TCPIP, allowing to even run the GUI not on the same machine as the server However, this feature is not necessary.p  pIf using some kind of IPC, how should the communication work Should I use an ASCII interface The Art Of Unix Programming prefers this This would have the advantage that my GUI just needs to parse the output of my command line tool. I dont have to change my tool very much, because it does not make much difference if the tool writes to a socketpipe or just to cout. If so, should I define a protocol for IPC or just parse the inputoutputp  pAnother way would be to integrate the GUI to my tool directly, resulting in just one executable. Insight debugger does it this way. Insight not just uses gdb, it has its own gdb in its programm code. This way I wont have to write a parser, my GUI code can just call functions from my base code.p  pOr should I make my command line tool a library, which I can link with a cli or a GUI frontendp  pWhat would be the best way to solve my problem What are the avantagesdisadvantes of the solutions above What do you preferp

It works great with y, but gnuplot tells me I cant have a logscale for the xaxis when Im using histogram style.p  pAny ideas to debug this or on how to present the results using a similar wayp  precodeset style data histogram set style histogram cluster gap 1 set style fill solid border 1 set logscale xy plot reshistoldlrer using 2xtic1 title Run codepre  pThe error is p  precodeline 0 Log scale on X is incompatible with histogram plots codepre  pThanks in advance.p  pEdit  btw, I was using gnuplot 4.4 patchlevel 4 and just updated to the newest version  i.e. 4.6 patchlevel 5p

Negative 4301 pIn Android you can get the strongSIM operatorstrong and strongnetwork operatorstrong codes easily via a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidtelephonyTelephonyManager.html relnofollowTelephonyManagera using a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidtelephonyTelephonyManager.htmlgetSimOperator2829 relnofollowgetSimOperatora and a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidtelephonyTelephonyManager.htmlgetNetworkOperator2829 relnofollowgetNetworkOperatora. Each of this methods return the MCCMNC string. So you get one MCCMNC string for the SIM operator and another MCCMNC string for the current network operator.p  pMy understanding is that this two strings dont always match, for example when changing the provider of the network while still using a SIM from the previous provider they can be different.p  pSo Im looking on how to get this codes in iOS, and I found that you can get a a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationNetworkingInternetReferenceCTCarrierReferenceReference.html relnofollowCTCarriera via a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationNetworkingInternetReferenceCTTelephonyNetworkInfoReferenceReference.htmlapplerefoccinstpCTTelephonyNetworkInfosubscriberCellularProvider relnofollowsubscriberCellularProvidera.

But are these MCC and MCN strings from the strongSIM operatorstrong or from the strongnetwork operatorstrong And, is there any way of getting both things in iOSp

Negative 4301 pI a a bit new, but did do a Google search and here on Stack, but with no results that helped me solve this issue.  I have taken some ObjectiveC via Lynda.com courses with Simon Allardice, which were great starting points, but what I need to do is thisp  pI am writing a simple demo  reference app that has a bunch of controls on the interface UIButton, UISwitch etc.  I also have to the right, a TextView control.  When the user touches the button for example, I want to show the code I used to perform the actions in the method as sort of a how to or How I did that reference for myself.p  pI have triedp  pNSString myCode  copied code snipped into herep  pBut I get a warning that is not clear to me.  I thought that perhaps I needed to use the stringWithFormat method on the NSString, but that did not work out either.  So, how can I copy snippets of code into a NSString var so that I can reference it i my app at runtime showing the text in the TextView controlp  pThanksp

The div for the popup is obviously inside the page, not the container. bPopup is moving the div to within  the codeltbodygtcode tags of the containing page. This means that the div is available on all pages navigated to after the bPopup call. Closing the popup is not moving the div back, so when the page is reloaded using the nav buttons, the div is being duplicated.p  pstrongLatest Progressstrongp  pAfter speaking to the client I am not able to plost a live link, unfortunately.And to create a jsFiddle would take ages.p  pAs explained in the edits above, the issue is bPopup recreating the popup div inside the parent page and not removing it on popup close.p  pI am not sure if there is a way to delete an element on the page The problem is, if an element can be deleted, the copy that bpopup creates is exactly the same as the original, so any script that targets the duplicate will also target the originalp

Negative 4301 pI have a Node.js gear not scaled and a PHP gear scaled with a MySQL cartridge. I want to connect to the MySQL cartridge from the Node.js app.p  pThe documentation for this is not concise and seems outdated, but from what Ive gathered I need to forward my MySQL port to the Node.js app.p  pI created a publicprivate key pair on the MySQL gear using codesshkeygen f OPENSHIFTDATADIRmykeycode. Next I added the contents of codemykey.pubcode into my RedHat accounts Settings  Public Keys section. Next I tried to copy the private key to the Node.js server using codescp OPENSHIFTDATADIRmykey 59bc0f5c50014651f7020097nodegearmydomain.rhcloud.comapprootdata.code but this gave me a permissions error, so next I tried codescp i OPENSHIFTDATADIRmykey OPENSHIFTDATADIRmykey 59bc0f5c50014651f7020097nodegearmydomain.rhcloud.comapprootdata.code and I think that did what it needed to, but Im not sure.p  pDoes that seem right From here what do I do And is there an easier way to connect to a database cartridge on another gearp

Negative 4301 pI am wanting to advance my Browser Google capabilities to be able to read and write files saved on my PC using Javascript and I am considering using Rhino because it is discussed in my manual.  However, Rhino uses Java to interact with a language I am not familiar with.  I have used C on a number of occasions and it would appear that the rules for C are similar in Java.p  pBefore embarking on the learning curve of Rhino and Java, is this a wise choice At the moment, all I want to do is to open, amend and save files from within a browser on my PC using Javascript. Eventually, I want to pass data from my browser to a program like Frame3DD and to analyse the results probably by saving the data to externalfiles.p  pAll help appreciated.p  pRegardsp

Negative 4301 pIm writing an application that replicates data on three SSDs.

Im able to toggle the menu on and off by clicking on the About Me link.

Negative 4301 pSo Im having trouble with my code hence why Im asking this question. My goal is to write a function, that has a different output depending on the case of the input. There were three different cases I had to worry about double, logical and char. Ive already dealt with the double case and that code is working perfectly fine. Im having issues with the other two cases. p  pThis is what I have to do for the logical case  If the first input is logical class, then the 2nd input is guaranteed to represent a number and be length 1. However, the 2nd input can vary between double and char class. So it could either be [5] or 5, which are very different. For your first output in this case, simply output the opposite of the first input. For example, if your first input was [true false false true], then your first output should be [false true true false]. For your second output in this case, check whether the number represented in the 2nd input is even, and output a single true or false, true is the number is even. If the class of that input was double, then simply leave this second output as logical class. If the class of the 2nd input was char, then output a string of True or False instead of just a logical value.p  pExamplep  precode  [out1, out2]  ifOnlyIfOnlytrue, 22   out1  false  logical class   out2  True  as a string codepre  pI get false as a 0 but my second output is 1 1. I need it to be Truep  pFor the char case Char If the first input is char class, then the second input is always   guaranteed to be another string. You will need to find which string is longer, and remove indices from it that go past the length of the shorter string. Your first output will then be the two strings concatenated together with a space between them, and the second output will be a single true of false true if the inputted strings were originally the same length, and false if they were not and you had to shorten one. If you have to shorten one of the inputted strings, then the shortened version of that string should be what you use to concatenate them together for your first output.p  precodefunction[Output1, Output2]  ifOnlyIfOnlyinput1, input2  if isnumericinput1  1     Output1  input1sumsuminput2     Output2  input2 . input1 end Works perfectly here  if islogicalinput1  1 ampamp ischarinput2  1     Output1  input1 My Output1 works correctly     Output2  charmodinput2, 2  0 I need to figure out how to convert from a logical case to a char case here. Should I do something along the lines of num2str here elseif islogicalinput1  1 ampamp isnumericinput1  1     Output1  input1     Output2  modinput2, 2  1 end   if ischarinput1  1     switch input1         case strcmpinput1, input2  1             Output1  [input1   input2]             Output2  false     end codepre  pI cannot run my third testcase [out1, out2]  ifOnlyIfOnlyHello, Worldddd since it keeps flagging me for the isnumeric part up top. p

The problem presents almost as soon as the page loads and gets items to filter, and initially the filterType is set to Rank.p  pI have read that array.sort modifies the array in place, i.e. it does not return a new array.  Is my understanding on that count correct  .sort would not cause this problem as it is returning the same array it came in with, the items are just changed in position.  That applies to filterTypes of Money and Rank.p  pFor Tracked Players and Connections is there a better way to handle those than by creating a new array and pushing specific items into it according to the filter  While this does not appear to be the culprit in this instance, it seems to fit the mold that others have suggested as possible causes in other SO articles regarding this error.p  pI feel like I am spinning my wheels on this, I spent about 6 hours yesterday after work fiddling with this trying to diagnose and fix it.  I have narrowed it down to the filtering mechanism above, but other than that, I am having no luck.p  h1Updateh1  pThis seems to have specifically to do with Internet Explorer.  I tested the filter in Chrome and Firefox and it was only hit once per filterType change e.g. user changes the value of the Filter dropdown which in turn changes the filterType and fires off the filter.p  pInternet Explorer however repeatedly hits the filter.  And only when filterType  Rank.  I dont get that though.  Rank and Money have almost the exact same sorting scheme, just on different properties.p  pJust to be sure that this did not have something to do with the fact that I set filterType  Rank in the initialization of the controller, I changed it to all three of the other values in turn.  No problems.  This now seems specifically to do with possibly the comparison of the values WinnerPosition numeric or with some value somehow changing on the item being sorted.p  h1Stepping Through Execution Updateh1  pOK, so I may need someone to enlighten me.  The watchCollectionWatch function angular.js12307 in my case iterates through the items in each collection on the scope and checks the oldValue i.e. what was passed into the filter in this case with the newValue what came back  if the two are different it increments changeDetected signaling that a collection has changed.  When a collection changes that has a filter on it, it reruns the filter.  In my case I am changing the ordering of the collection and thus every time the filter gets run, it reads it as having changed.  How to get around thisp

Negative 4301 pAlright, looks like I could use some help again...p  pCurrently, Im working on merging three applications under a single signon. One application is custom, the other is YAF and the third is the Screwturn wiki. Currently, the custom and YAF applications are successfully integrated using YAFs sample web application and seems to work just fine.p  pThe problem Im currently running into is the Intelligencia URL Rewriter that comes with YAF. Its redirecting AccountLogin.aspx my original login correctly to YAFs as intended and even redirects the likes of FreddyKruegerLogin.aspx to the correct login. But when I go to a secure page in Screwturn, I get redirected to this WikiPageNotFound.aspxPageforum . p  pAnd my best guess is that its rewriting to this WikiForum.aspxloginstuff which Screwturn then reinterprets as the above, when, I believe, I need it to rewrite to this ForumLogin.aspx. p  pAt this point, Im not sure if this is a rewrite issue, a child application issue or, more likely both.p  pOnce again, any and all clues would be greatly appreciated as this is all volunteer work and Ive been burning a huge amount of time trying to figure this out.

Negative 4301 pI am currently trying to implement a noderivative multivariate optimization in java using the apache library.

Below is what I have so far for running my optimization. p  precodepublic static double[] Optimizedouble[][] contractDataMatrix, double[] modelData,String modelType,String weightType     ObjectiveFunction objective  new       ObjectiveFunctioncontractDataMatrix,modelType,weightType      org.apache.commons.math3.optim.nonlinear.scalar.noderiv.SimplexOptimizer optimizer new    org.apache.commons.math3.optim.nonlinear.scalar.noderiv.SimplexOptimizer.01,.001     org.apache.commons.math3.optim.nonlinear.scalar.ObjectiveFunction obj  new     org.apache.commons.math3.optim.nonlinear.scalar.ObjectiveFunctionobjective        org.apache.commons.math3.optim.PointValuePair finalDataoptimizer.optimize     new org.apache.commons.math3.optim.MaxEval200,     obj,     GoalType.MINIMIZE,     new InitialGuessmodelData           return finalData.getPoint   codepre  pFirst I create an ObjectiveFunction, which is a class I made as a wrapper of the apache ObjectiveFunction class that extends it. I did this because the objective function is itself a function of several arguments, which are not of import to my question. Then I contruct a SimplexOptimizer and try to call optimize on it following an example I found online. Though the docs do not say clearly what is required as input, I believe I have provided all necessary arguments, with one possible exception which I discuss in the edit below. Anyways, I am getting the following errorp  precodeException in thread main org.apache.commons.math3.exception.NullArgumentException null is not     allowed at   org.apache.commons.math3.optim.nonlinear.scalar.noderiv.SimplexOptimizer.checkParametersSimplexOptimizer.java214 at org.apache.commons.math3.optim.nonlinear.scalar.noderiv.SimplexOptimizer.doOptimizeSimplexOptimizer.java128 at org.apache.commons.math3.optim.nonlinear.scalar.noderiv.SimplexOptimizer.doOptimizeSimplexOptimizer.java89 at org.apache.commons.math3.optim.BaseOptimizer.optimizeBaseOptimizer.java154 at org.apache.commons.math3.optim.BaseMultivariateOptimizer.optimizeBaseMultivariateOptimizer.java66 at org.apache.commons.math3.optim.nonlinear.scalar.MultivariateOptimizer.optimizeMultivariateOptimizer.java64 at org.apache.commons.math3.optim.nonlinear.scalar.noderiv.SimplexOptimizer.optimizeSimplexOptimizer.java122 at compfin3.CompFin3.OptimizeCompFin3.java181 at compfin3.CompFin3.mainCompFin3.java118 Java Result 1 codepre  pDoes anyone have any idea what null value this error refers to, and how I might fix itp  pBest,p  pPaulp  pEDIT I believe I have tracked down the source of the problem. It appears that as a part of my optimization data that I pass to the optimizer, I was forgetting to define the specific AbstractSimplex I am using.

Negative 4301 pIs there a way to determine the area a component could have for itself in a containerp  pIm using a hrefhttpwww.miglayout.com relnofollowMigLayouta. Say I have two components a codeJPanelcode and a codeJSlidercode, that are added in a container. The JSlider is docked south of the container, and growsshrinks horizontally when the container is resized. The JPanel has some initial size, say, 100x100. In this scenario, the JPanel could have for itself all the area the container has, except for the area that the JSlider occupies. So if the container is 400x400, the JPanel emcouldem have a size of 400x384, if the slider had a height of 16, and if it expanded fully.p  pAnyway, If I call codepanel.getSizecode, I get 100x100, as I should.

Negative 4301 pIm working on an iPad application that requires a UISplitViewController. For the Master view controller I would like to use a custom view controller that has an image, a table view , and a label. Out of the box the UISplitviewcontrollerMasterDetail template give me a Navigation controller with an embedded UItableViewcontroller. When I attempt to change out the tableview controller for a new Viewcontroller the view for the new controller is not being presented. I am able to set the UIBarbuttons but none of the datasource methods for the table view are being called. Also the imageview and the label are not being presented. Ive made sure that my view controller is the delegate and datasource for the tableview and set the preferred size in the awake from nib still no UI. Im adding the UISprlitviewcontroller to an existing project could this be an issuep
Negative 4301 pIve been working angular for probably six or so months and so have been working a lot more with JSON and objects in javascript.  This situation Ive been running into has been frustrating and I dont understand the reasoning.  Maybe its my inexperience with JS and so I dont know the reasoning or maybe Im just doing it wrong but Id appreciate any insight into this.p  pExample an objectp  precode    var data            object                    KeyValue,          stuffhere        ,        array        [                            NamePizza Face,             id7           ,                          NameMaple bar,             id1                   ]      codepre  pSo, lets say I want to add an object to the array.  Easy, rightp  precodevar newObject  Name Master Sword, id2 data.array.pushnewObject codepre  pBut, lets say I want to add the object to the array before the array exists.  The above method errors out saying codeCannot read property push of undefinedcode.  Instead, I have to wrap a condition around it.p  precode  var newObject  Name Master Sword, id2   ifdata.array     data.array.pushnewObject      else     data.array  []     data.array.pushnewObject    codepre  pI am allowed to add new objects to codedatacode whenever I want.  However, woe unto me should I try to add an object within an object.p  pExamplep  precodedata.newObject  Name Master Sword, id2 codepre  pnewObject will be created in this case and everyone is happy.p  precodedata.newObject.Name  Master Sword codepre  pFAIL  codeCannot set property Name of undefinedcode  p  pSo...why doesnt JS just create newObject with the laid out key value pair  Or when I try to push to an array that doesnt exist why not just create the array rather than error outp  pI want to be clear, although this is frustrating to me my purpose of this question isnt to complain.  Its to ask if Im doing this wrong.  Do I really need a condition to check if the objectarray exists before trying to add to it  Is there a better way to do thisp

Negative 4301 pI saw many examples online, about how to realize databinding to an objects attribute. Most people did it by adding the attribute codeDisplayMemberBindingBinding Datecode to a codeGridViewColumncode. p  pWhat I want to do is slightly different I have a codeListltstring[]gtcode and I want to add multiple columns dynamically to my codeGridViewcode which is inside a codeListViewcode btw. while the program runs. Every new column should have the content of the specific list element. In fact that means that the first column should list the first string array of the codeListcode, the second column the second index, etc.p  pAnyone who knows how to realize thatp  pBest regards p

Negative 4301 pAggregates must be designed to be transactionally and eventually consistency. This consistency boundary around entities helps manage complexity.p  pIn our repository implementations, we are using Entity Framework to interface with the actual database. Historically we have always had huge contexts spanning scores of tables which represent every available table, field and relationship in the database or at least in some functional area of the database. The problem here is that this context is used for hundreds of different things and grows exponentially as the system gets bigger, leading to something which is very difficult to maintain. p  h2Division by Bounded Contexth2  pDue to this, it is often suggested that separate DbContexts should be created for each bounded context in the system. Julie Lerman proposed this in her article, a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenusmagazinejj883952.aspx relnofollowShrink EF Models with DDD Bounded Contextsa. p  h2Division by Aggregateh2  pIf our aggregates are transactionally consistent, what is stopping us from going one step further and creating dedicated contexts to serve each aggregate repositoryp  pInstead of being promiscuous serving everyones needs, it would give the context strongemclear intentionemstrong.p  ul lipThe context will only ever need to change when the aggregate needs to change. It evolves with the aggregate. With larger contexts, many parts of the system could depend on one part of the context. A single change could jeopardise a lot. pli lipOnly the tables, fields and relationships needed by the aggregate will need to exist in the context.  Often when dealing with a larger context, you arent bothered with most of the relations or fields on a given table. pli ul  pThere are drawbacks with this approach.  Namelyp  ul lipAlthough they would likely be modeled differently depending on their use, certain database tables and relationships may need to exist in multiple contexts. pli lipIf used, codefirst migrations would be tricky.pli lipThis may be considered as overengineering.pli ul  pstrongCan anyone provide further any insight on this approachstrong Is there perhaps something which I have overlooked p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pNote that we are not using the EF data entities in our domain.

That could look something like thisp  precodeHtml.MyHelpers.LoginBox codepre  pThat would output something like thisp  precodeltform methodpost actionMyActiongt     ltinput typetext nameemail gt     ltinput typetext namepassword gt     ltinput typesubmit valueLog in gt ltformgt codepre  pI know I can do this with a string and output to the response, but I would like to make use of the model itself the UserModel in this case. By doing that I can utilize the functionality for verification of email, display name etc. This approach still require me to add views to my web application, but I dont need to wire up all models to labels etc.p  h1Alternative approachh1  pAnother way of doing this might be compiled views. This will not require any views for handling the identity within each web application. However, if I need to tweak the login view for one of those web applications, I could do this by adding a view to the exact same path as the compiled one. Im not to sure which approach is best.p  h1Now, the questionsh1  ol lipI have yet to find a good sample or tutorial out there that covers creating a form in code behind and adding other input types, labels, text , AntiForgeryToken etc using a model and then render everything in HTML. Does any of you know such tutorial or samplepli lipGiven the situation, background and goal which approach do you think is easiest to implement, maintain and overridepli ol  pBig thanks in advancep  pFredrikp  pPS The last question is more of a discussion, so forgive me for asking.p

Negative 4301 pAccording to the codeSwingWorkercode Javadocp  blockquote   pWhen writing a multithreaded application using Swing, there are two constraints to keep in mindp      ul   liTimeconsuming tasks should not be run on the Event Dispatch Thread. Otherwise the application becomes unresponsive.li   liSwing components should be accessed on the Event Dispatch Thread only.li   ul blockquote  pThus, when using codeSwingWorkercode, we must access Swing Components only in codedonecode and codeprocesscode methods.p  pSo, I created a sample application which loads 3000 rows from database in chunks, each chunk with 50 rows and display it.p  precodeSwingWorkerltListltPersongt, Persongt worker      new SwingWorkerltListltPersongt, Persongt         protected ListltPersongt doInBackground           ListltPersongt data  new ArrayListltgt          while hasMoreData              ListltPersongt chunk  loadFiftyRows             data.addAllchunk             publishchunk                    return data               protected void processListltPersongt chunks           for Person person  chunks              container.addcreatePanelForperson                    container.revalidate          container.repaint             worker.execute codepre  pAs, All swing access must be done on EDT, I am creating new codeJPanelcode instances for each codepersoncode in the codeprocesscode method. But, still the application is quite heavy on start up. It freezes and response to the events while the data is loading, is quite late.p  pAlthough, we are publishing 50 rows at a time, the chunk size gets bigger when codeprocesscode method is invoked on EDT, sometimes 1000 rows. I think this is the cause of the delay, creating 1000 instances of codeJPanelcode on EDTp  pI feel, creating 1000 new instances of codeJPanelcode is also a quite heavy task, to be performed on EDT. strongSo, cant we create these codeJPanelcode instances in codedoInBackgroundcode method, store it in a collection and then add those already created codeJPanelcode instances to the codecontainercode in the codeprocesscode methodstrongp  pBut, it will contradict the statement, Swing components should be accessed on the Event Dispatch Thread only p  pDoes this statement mean, strongExisting Swing Components that have been added to the Swing Component Hierarchy and not newly created Swing Componentsstrongp

Negative 4301 pI have a sheet with a list of contracts with a column for the supplier name  and one for the ending date, what I want to do is to make all passed dates red unless the contract is from a specific supplier. I had previously used codeInStrcode to check if a cell had a string inside so since I have just started with vba I thought of inserting the following in my loopp  precodeIf Not InStrLCaseData.Cellsi, 4.Value, flowserve Then     If CDateData.Cellsi, h.Value lt Date Then          Data.Cellsi, h.Font.Color  16776961 End If codepre  pexpecting it would colour passed dates of the contracts that do not have flowserve in the supplier name.

Negative 4301 pIm trying to get mouse location data from PDCurses, and it generally works. The problem is, if the mouse button is pressed twice before an event check happens, only one of the events will be popped from the queue. This means that the event for the second press is still in the queue, and the next time the mouse is pressed, the old location will be popped instead of the most recent. If this keeps happening, the queue starts to get backed up, and the reported mouse presses become less and less recent.p  pSince the only thing Im using codegetchcode for is for mouse events Im using Windows codeGetAsyncKeyStatecode and my own manager for keyboard events, I thought that an easy fix would just be to clear the event queue after reading a mouse event.p  pUnfortunately though, it doesnt seem to be that easy, since I cant find any methods that allow clearing the queue.p  pThe only way I could think of was to set codegetchcode to nonblocking using codenodelaycode, then repeatedly use codegetchcode, keeping the last event that was popped. That seems inefficient and inaccurate though.p  pBecause this is potentially an XY problem, heres the function in questionp  precodevoid EventHandlergetMousePosintamp x, intamp y      MEVENT event     if ncgetmouseampevent  OK          x  event.x, y  event.y       codepre  pEventHandler.hp  precodeifndef EVENTHANDLERH define EVENTHANDLERH  include ltvectorgt include ltatomicgt include ltthreadgt include ltfunctionalgt include ltwindows.hgt include ltWinUser.hgt include curses.h  define LEFTMOUSE VKLBUTTON define RIGHTMOUSE VKRBUTTON define MIDDLEMOUSE VKMBUTTON  typedef stdfunctionltvoidchargt KeyHandler typedef stdfunctionltvoidchar,long,longgt MouseHandler  class EventHandler       stdthread listeningThread      stdatomicltboolgt listening  false      stdvectorltchargt keysToCheck     stdvectorltchargt mButtonsToCheck      KeyHandler keyHandler  KeyHandler     MouseHandler mouseHandler  MouseHandler      void actOnPressedKeys  public     EventHandler      EventHandler      void setKeyHandlerKeyHandler     void setMouseHandlerMouseHandler      void setKeysToListenOnstdvectorltchargt     void setButtonsToListenOnstdvectorltchargt      void listenForPressesint loopMSDelay  100     void stopListening      static void getMousePosintamp x, intamp y    endif codepre  pEventHandler.cppp  precodeinclude EventHandler.h  include ltthreadgt include ltstdexceptgt include ltcctypegt  EventHandlerEventHandler     EventHandlerEventHandler      stopListening     if listeningThread.joinable          May need to fix this.

Negative 4301 pWere trying to use MediaExtractor, MediaCodec and AudioTrack to develop our own player to replace MediaPlayer, which has too many issues and is not enough customizable. Now we ran into a lot of issues using both MediaExtractor and AudioTrack, but its that following issue that really gets mep  pMediaExtractor does two different things it downloads the target media file over the network and caches the bytes, and then it parses its content. The parsing stuff seems ok, but the downloading amp caching... not so.p  pIve just found out that, if network issues occur while MediaExtractor has not yet finished to download the target file over the network, sensible parsing calls like MediaExtractor.readSampleData become blocking until MediaExtractor succeeds in reconnecting to the target file or when it just quits trying. Now I dont understand why MediaExtractor would prevent the client code from reading the already cached samples suppose that 99 of the media file was already downloaded and cached when the WIFI went down. Another call that unexpectedly blocks during network issues is MediaExtractor.getCachedDuration, when youre trying to figure out how much of the media file content has been cached so far.p  pThis doesnt seem normal behaviour to me.

Negative 4301 pIm facing a problem and want to ask for a solution.p  pIm working on an eclipse plugin project, in which an editor for a type of resource file is required. The resource file has similar structure like csv file. My idea is to provide user the option to edit this type of file both in plain text format and also in an SWT table. Plain text is required for examining data and table provides more flexibility to editing such as sorting by column. p  pI have been able to create a codeMultiPageEditorPartcode, with one page of codeorg.eclipse.ui.editors.text.TextEditorcode, and another page with a codeorg.eclipse.swt.widgets.Tablecode and several other widgets like search bar. The content of the resource file can be shown in the codeTextEditorcode, can also be edited and saved. On the other hand, the content can be loaded in the table too, sorting and searching all work good. p  pThe problem is when I edit a cell in the table, I want the change also reflected in the codeTextEditorcode, and vice versa. Since the resource file can be very large, I want the saving action happen only on the codeTextEditorcode, i.e. I dont want any modification in the table directly stored to resource file, but to mark the file dirty. But I cant figure out how. How can I for example get the content of codeEditorInputcode, check it line by line, and modify it outside codeTextEditorcodep  pOr, are there more efficient ways to do this Can anyone give any hintsp
Negative 4301 pSo 2 months ago i stumbled upon the problem that my game that i was working on did not scale with other devices. So i decided to implement viewports since people said that it was the best way and also an easy way. But its been around 2 months since i started and still dont have a working example. I have read every single page i could find, read the wiki multiple times and ask several people but never got an answer that helped me getting it to work.p  pSo the problem is that i need to do 3 things, First i have a stage, this is were i would place all my actors on buttons and stuff, then i need my cam in this case a OrthographicCamera, and then i need a viewport to scale everything.p  pThis is my lastest test a hrefhttppastebin.comZvZmeHLs relnofollowhttppastebin.comZvZmeHLsap  pMy createp  precodeOverride     public void create               cam  new OrthographicCamera800, 600             viewport  new FillViewportGdx.graphics.getWidth, Gdx.graphics.getHeight, cam             viewport.updateGdx.graphics.getWidth, Gdx.graphics.getHeight, true             stage  new Stageviewport              atlas  new TextureAtlasLoadingScreen.pack             Logo  new Imageatlas.findRegionVeslaLogo             stage.addActorLogo      codepre  pand my resizep  precodeOverride     public void resizeint Width, int Height              viewport.updateWidth, Height, true              Logo.setSize700, 500             Logo.setXWidth  2  Logo.getWidth  2             Logo.setYHeight  2  Logo.getHeight  2             Logo.setOriginLogo.getWidth  2, Logo.getHeight  2      codepre  pI first thought that it was working, on a nexus one it looked good, had everything on screen but when i tested it on a s4 mini it was way to big. Now i dont know if this is because im just not understanding viewports or that im thinking way too complicated. The only thing that i know is that im totally lost and have no idea what else i could try. So it would be great if someone could push me in the right direction, or could explain to me why this isnt working.p  pps i also tested it with fixed sizes but this didnt make any difference for some reasonp  pSample of the fixed size one a hrefhttppastebin.commpjkP9ru relnofollowhttppastebin.commpjkP9ruap  precodeprivate int VIRTUALWIDTH  600  private int VIRTUALHEIGHT  900   Override     public void create               stage  new Stagenew StretchViewportVIRTUALWIDTH, VIRTUALHEIGHT             cam  new OrthographicCameraVIRTUALWIDTH, VIRTUALHEIGHT       codepre  pand my resizep  precodeOverride     public void resizeint Width, int Height              Width  VIRTUALWIDTH               Height  VIRTUALHEIGHT               stage.getViewport.updateWidth, Height, true       codepre  pIf more example or anything is needed please let me know, im in a state were i would try anything to get it workingp  pEdit i managed to get it working with the help of donfuxx . for those interested in the codea hrefhttppastebin.com8v2PB2t9 relnofollowhttppastebin.com8v2PB2t9ap

Since the saveToPhoenix method is not yet available for the Java API and since this is just a POC, my idea was to simply use the JDBC driver for each minibatch. p  precodepublic class

Negative 4301 pId like to make a class codeCarcode extendable by allowing injection of a usermade subclass of codeEnginecode.p  pSo one user might want a diesel carp  precodeDieselEngine de  new DieselEngine degtsetGlowplugTemperature1200  something specific for a Diesel cargtsetEnginede cargtdrive codepre  pWhile the other wants something elsep  precodeFluxCapacitorEngine fce  new FluxCapacitorEngine fcegtsetDestinationYear1985 cargtsetEnginefce cargtdrive codepre  pInternally, codeCarcode calls pure virtual methods of its instance of codeEnginecode in order to do its business. The issue now is, if at a later time the user wishes to do some more configuring on the engine, he would either have to keep a pointer e.g. of type codeDieselEnginecode externally in order to access it, or use a dynamic castp  precodeif DieselEngine de  dynamiccastltDieselEnginegtcargtengine   degtsetMixRatio2.1 codepre  pI dont find either variants particularily nice. strongAre there alternatives to achieve this kind of customizabilityextendabilitystrongp  pemA solution that I find lacking current stateem one could leave the implementation of the engine part inside codeCarcode, and make the user subclass the whole thing like codeclass Delorean public Carcode, so he could directly call the specific methodsp  precodedeloreangtsetDestinationYear1985  introduced method with the Delorean class deloreangtdrive  inherited method of Car codepre  pHowever and this is where the analogy becomes shaky, bear with me I want to preserve the option of hotswapping the engine while the codeAutobahncode and the codeInsuranceCompanycode hold pointers to the codecarcode. This wouldnt be possible if we subclassed codeCarcode because we cant transform a codecarcode to a codedeloreancode instance without changing its pointer.p  pstrongAnother complicationstrong The current implementation of my codeCarcode doesnt have this extensible, externally settable engine. Instead its like in the previous paragraph all the engine parts are in the codeCarcode implementation in the form how 80 of my users need their engine. The configuration setters of the engine part of the car are directly and easily accessible via the cars public interface.p  pSo if I now switch to the external engine concept, Ill be upsetting 80 of my users who are happy with the default engine, because instead ofp  precodecargtsetSparkVoltage1000 codepre  pthey would then need to writep  precodeif DefaultGasolineEngine dge  dynamiccastltDefaultGasolineEnginegtcargtengine   dgegtsetSparkVoltage1000 codepre  pugh.

Negative 4301 pRecently I experienced some serious performance issues within my php application which tries to do some stuff with more than a ten thousand lines of CSVdata. Basically I have around ten functions which consists of different pregmatch  pregreplace actions which process one column of each line of the parsed csvdata NLP DateParser, various string modifying things, image recognition from html source, etc.p  pBecause I am reaching spheres where processing of the script is really slow between 50 and 120 seconds also as memory issues too complex objects its now time for some performance improvements p  pSo I came over pthreads which allows multi threading within a php script. But I am not really sure if this helps in my situation or just producing more performance issues than it solves through overhead of thread handlingp  pMy idea is to loop through all ten thousand lines and start a thread for each column processing step 10k lines  10 columns  10k  10  100.000 threads. Do you think that this will lead to performance improvements Or should I rather split the csvdata in to chunks lets say 200 rows which will be processed in separate threads 10k lines  200 chunks  50 threadsp  pI would have attached an image consisting my profiled php script where you can see which functions are consuming much time but I sadly have not enough reputation points p  pIs there any potential in parallel processing Can I add Attributes to the same object directly from different threads or do I have to synchronize first therefore wait for the threads to complete Is it possible to read the same file in multiple threads first hunderd rows thread 1, second hundred in thread 2, etc. and building one big object containing all rows at the end of all processing stepsp  pI hope my bad English does not prevent you from understanding my thoughts and questions...p  pThanks in advicep  pmfuesslinp  pstrongEDITstrong I am not sure about the bottlenecks Guessing the biggest one is the handling of the big object resulting from processing all the csv data... Profiler got my attention to some redundant foreach loops which I was able to ommit. But the main problem is the amount of data I have to process. All processing functions need not that much time but if you process 10k in a row....p  pThe idea of operating with inmemory db instead of csv is nice  will try that out.p  pThe preg functions cannot be replaced by str functions because I need pattern recognition.p  pI will also try Gearman and try to separate each data processing step in individual jobs.p  pPHP Version is 5.6.10 with opcache enabled.p

Negative 4301 pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI am writing a tool using MVC where the model is written in C, controller in JavaScriptjQuery and the view in HTMLCSS. The reason the model is in C is for eventual portability to a thick client from the speed build on web. p  pstrongIssuestrongp  pMy major roadblock at this point is connecting my C model to the HTML form that is currently collecting input data from the user. p  pI have looked into a hrefhttpsgithub.comkripkenemscripten relnofollowEmscriptena for compiling the C directly into JavaScript, but I dont like the idea of having my underlying model be visible to the end user in emany formem. This is due to the model being hooked up to a MySQL server handling a lot of sensitive data. I want to minimize risk of the end user accidentally or purposely messing with the function call invoking the model.p  pI have done quite a bit of research on PHPC linking, but all the resources I could find have been severely outdated andor convoluted.p  pId ideally like to have the the data pushed to the server using a POST method before invoking the model so I can have maximum control over input validation both on the end user and server side.p  pIve also thought about using PHP to push to the MySQL server then having the C pull down from the server, but this seems a little obfuscated and raises the issue of whenhow to wake the C up.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pIs there a good way to maintain security of my model have it run entirely serverside behind a POST method as well as the understandability of how this was implemented I am a temp employee and my project will pass to other hands for the port to a thick client from web.p  pSpeed is also a concern, but Im assuming or hoping that the only bottleneck will be the pipescript between the POST to the server and the C since most of the heavylifting will be occurring in the model. p

Negative 4301 pSome Background information  So I am right now working with an application that runs on a server and generates sets of data. I then use a basex database that is on the same server as the generating application. The application is used as a REST service, so I generate my queries via http requests with my browser and then recieve, as an answer, a set of data that is displayed to the user. This data I now want to store into my basex database.p  pThe questions I now probably sound rather stupid, since it would I imagine be rather easy to answer for anyone who has really understood the whole concept of NoSQL Databasing, but here I gop  pSo right now Im really wondering about what a smart way to use a basexdatabase would be. Whenever Im adding new data to the database, but also when I want to call up data I have saved previously, I cannot think of if it was better or tidier to have one huge XMLFile in which I store everything I got, or rather create a new file into my database whenever I add a new set of data.p  pOn the one hand I think that one big file would probably be easier to handle if I want to pick out different sets of data for comparing the results, but also be a lot messier and harder to keep clean. After thinking about that for a while I just came to think that there has to be a conventional way in which it would be usually done. p  pThanks for helping and sorry for all the useless talk that actually has nothing to do with the question. I really need to learn how to make my questions short and precise. p

Because if Ann is ready to send a value but Joe hasnt done that yet, Ann will still be blocked, waiting to deliver the value to main.p  pThis confused me. Whats the meaning of if Ann is ready to send a value but Joe hasnt done that yet, Ann will still be blocked As we know, a channel builds the communication between two goroutines and synchronizes their executions. But we have crated two channels here codejoecode and codeanncode. The main goroutine talks with two new goroutines via codejoecode and codeanncode, respectively. Does that mean the synchronization nature is also valid between channels Or that the main goroutine can talk with only one other goroutine at a timep
