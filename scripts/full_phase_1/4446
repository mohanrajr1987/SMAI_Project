Up until now, this has worked just fine, but now, for no known reason, every time I try to load the page, the page doesnt load and eventually crashes and until I am forced by memory issues to kill it, this happens in the Node appp  precodeMyiMacLearning Angular.js me node nodeapp.js Incoming request for libsbootstrapjsbootstrap.min.js1443846525840 Loaded page

Obviously this makes the page rather useless, if every url can only load the same template, but the information may be helpful. Of note is that main6.html and company6.html are basically identical, except for some changed text.p  h3Update 2h3  pIve figured out that whenever I use code.main6.htmlcode as the template url it works, but when I use code.company6.htmlcode, it doesnt. This means that this issue is isolated to loading the codecompanycode page, and the codecode page loads just fine.

Positive 4446 pSo to start, we have a Windows Server 2008 R2 running multiple websites under our main domain, so it will be domain.comsite.  The sites were created by someone else using mainly PHP, with a few ASP.Net pages, and only the ASP.Net pages broke after we installed SharePoint 2013 on our server SharePoint was not installed on it before.p  pThe main issue we first saw was a configuration error referencing a problem connecting to the SharePoint farm, which was the application pool in IIS was using user credentials that could not access a part of SharePoint.  This is most likely a configuration somewhere, but I could not find out where wasnt in Global Web.Config, Machine.Config, or any Web.Config i could find.p  pBecause the User Credentials fixed that error, we received another config error that said codePlatformNotSupportedException Operation is not supported on this platform.code  This pointed to the application pool being set to classic instead of integrated, and heres where Im at.  If I set the application pool which is .Net v4.0 btw to Integrated, the error goes away, but the entire site outside of SharePoint pulls up blank.  In the developer tools in Chrome, all i see is a 500 error Internal Server Error and nothing else.p  pIf I set the application pool back to classic, the PHP pages will load up fine, but the ASPX pages will load up with the codePlatformNotSupportedExceptioncode error.p  pException information p  precodeException type PlatformNotSupportedException  Exception message Operation is not supported on this platform.  at System.Web.HttpServerVarsCollection.SetString name, String value at Microsoft.SharePoint.IdentityModel.SPTokenCache.ReadTokenByte[] token at Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens.SessionSecurityTokenHandler.ReadTokenByte[] token, SecurityTokenResolver tokenResolver at Microsoft.IdentityModel.Web.SessionAuthenticationModule.ReadSessionTokenFromCookieByte[] sessionCookie at Microsoft.IdentityModel.Web.SessionAuthenticationModule.TryReadSessionTokenFromCookieSessionSecurityTokenamp sessionToken at Microsoft.IdentityModel.Web.SessionAuthenticationModule.OnAuthenticateRequestObject sender, EventArgs eventArgs at Microsoft.SharePoint.IdentityModel.SPSessionAuthenticationModule.OnAuthenticateRequestObject sender, EventArgs eventArgs at System.Web.HttpApplication.SyncEventExecutionStep.System.Web.HttpApplication.IExecutionStep.Execute at System.Web.HttpApplication.ExecuteStepIExecutionStep step, Booleanamp completedSynchronously codepre  pIn this exception message, it references SharePoint configurations the site is not using.

The PHP pages work fine with it set to classic, but part of the problem is the ASPX pages.  If I can find out where its pulling those configurations, Im hoping I can have some way to remove them from just the 1 site without affecting SharePoint.p  pIm hoping i did not miss anything important, but if I missed anything I will edit my post later to include more information.  I also dont fully understand how the configuration files work with sites in IIS, because it appears those configurations are inherited from somewhere.p  pstrongNote I did not design the WebApp page, and the person who did no longer works for us.strongp

Positive 4446 pIm seeking suggestions for high level architecture for the following web application.  I would prefer to use Struts and Tiles, as that is what I am most familiar with, but would consider other frameworks if it makes sense to do so. Im not opposed to using published customization points for any of the frameworks used e.g. Struts interceptors.  Id even consider using an open source Content Management System if it had the customization points I need for the specific ecommerce and other backend system integration needs. I really would like to stay in the Java realm.p  ul liMulticustomer ecommerce site, with all customers running in the same web application. This is not a standard ecommerce use case  these customers have some very specific needs that dont fit the standard ecommerce model. li liDifferentiate between customers using the host header field. li liEach customer will have a different look and feel colors, images, text, css. li liEach customer will have a common set of general pages home page, contact us, FAQ, about us,  general content pages.  li liEach customer will have an arbitrary number of product pages, one page per product. The addressname of the product page will be static for a given product, but each customer will have a completely disparate set of products.  In my current Struts projects, I solve this by having a defaultcatchall action that serves product content based on the request.getServletPath. li liThere will be a checkout sequence common to all customers cart, logincreate customer, etc. li liIdeally, Id be able to add customers and change customers look and feel without having to package and redeploy the web application.li ul  pI envision a kind of template based system, where each customer has a set of templates, one for each type of content home page, contact us, product.  Those templates would have special tags or markers that would pull in the generated content as necessary product description block, product images block, add to cart block, contact us form, link to a product page, etc.  p  pSome approaches Ive consideredp  ul liUse explicit Struts action definitions for the general pages home, contact us, etc and the default action for product pages, with Tiles results, using different Tiles definitions per customer. This seems to require updates to struts.xml and tiles.xml per customer, unless there is a way to dynamically configure theseli liUse static Struts and Tiles definitions for all page types, and pull in pieces of the customers templates in the right places. E.g. put the customers header here, content between header and product description block here, etc.  This forces all customers into a similar structure, which is not very good.li ul  pThanks for any and all suggestionsp

Positive 4446 pI am working on building a web application that needs to use a standalone JAR file at its core. Essentially, I have an application module packaged as a JAR file that I can run successfully on the Command prompt using a command like codejava jar myapp.jarcode and can pass some additional parameters as needed basically the file name to process. This JAR has some dependencies on other JAR files, which are placed in the libs folder located in the same folder as the codemyapp.jarcode file. All this is working fine as a standalone JAR file executed through the command prompt.p  pNow, I need to use this JAR inside a web application and do the same kind of processing. I have already got a Grails based web application setup with the required UI, etc. and I have added all the required JAR libs inside the codelibcode folder of my Grails web application. I have placed codemyapp.jarcode file as well in the same lib folder.p  pI am a little confused about how to run this codemyapp.jarcode file through my web applications Controller methods Basically, I have a form in my web application in which the users would specify the required file path needed to be processed by codemyapp.jarcode and then user would click the RunSubmit button. Upon that I need to launch codemyapp.jarcode with the supplied parameters of the file path and put the resultingprocessed file at some specified location.p  pSo, essentially do the processing similar to the standalone JAR execution on command prompt through the Web applications controller method.p  pCan someone kindly guide me regarding the right process to accomplish thisp  pAny help in this regard would be greatly appreciated.p

Positive 4446 pI would like to clone a dockerized application including all its data, which uses three containers in this example 1 a web application container such as a CMS, 2 a database container and 3 a datavolume container using docker volumes.p  pWith dockercompose, I can easily create identical instances of these containers with just the initial data. But what, if I want to clone a set of running containers on the same server, including all its accumulated data, in a similar way as I would clone a KVM container With KVM I would suspend or shutdown the VM, clone with something like virtclone and then start the cloned guest, which has all the same data as the original.p  pOne use case would be to create a clonesnapshot of a running development webserver before making major changes or before installing new versions of plugins.p  pWith Docker, this does not seem to be so straightforward, as data is not automatically copied together with its container. Ideally I would like to do something simple like codedockercompose clonecode and end up with a second set of containers identical to the first, including all their data. Neither Docker nor dockercompose provides a clone command as of version 1.8, thus I would need to consider various approaches, like backing up amp restoring the datadatabase or using a third party tool like Flocker.p  pRelated to this is the question on how to do something similar to KVM snapshots of a dockerized app, with the ability to easily return to a previous state. Preferably the cloning, snapshotting and reverting should be possible with minimal downtime. p  pWhat would be the preferred Docker way of accomplishing these thingsp  pEdit Based on the first answer, I will make my question a little more specific in order to hopefully arrive at programmatic steps to be able to do something like codedockercomposeclonecode and codedockercomposesnapshotcode using a bash or python script. Cloning the content of the docker volumes seems to be the key to this, as the containers themselves are basically cloned each time I run dockercompose on the same yaml file. p  pGenerally my fullclone script would need to p  ol liduplicate the directory containing the dockercompose fileli litemporarily stop the containersli licreate but not necessarily run the second set of containersli liemstrongdetermine the datavolumes to be duplicatedstrongemli libackup these datavolumes li lirestore the datavolumes into the cloned data containerli lipstart the second set of containersp  ul lipWould this be the correct way to go about it and how should I implement this Im especially not sure on how to do step 4 emdetermine the datavolumes to be duplicatedem in a script, as the command codedocker volume lscode will only be available in Docker 1.9. pli lipHow could I do something similar to KVM snapshots using this approach possibly using COW filesystem features from ZFS, which my Docker install is already using.pli ulli ol

Negative 4446 pIs there a simple and foolproof way we can test an AJAX installation  We have a problem in calling a webscript using AJAX form a JS file.  The error is ServiceLib is not defined. The error gets a few hits on Google.p  pWeve added some AJAX functionality to a customers app.  This works fine here in the office on dev machines and on our IIS Server, it works fine on the customers test web site, but when we put the app on the live site, the webscript calls fail.p  pThe customer installed AJAX on their live server a few days ago.  Weve verified that the service lib files are there and in the right places.  p  pWeve already spent hours on this with no solution and still do not know for sure whether there is something wrong with our code, or something is wrong on their server, or for that matter, whether AJAX is even correctly installed.  Part of our problem is that we have no access to their live server, so there is not much we can do other than change lines in our own code, give the app files to our contact there, and see what happens. The contact knows less than we do, so we are working blind.  A strange situation, I know, but there is beaurocracy involved.p  pMany thanks Mike Thomasp

Negative 4446 pI am working on a small toy project who is getting more and more releases. Until now, the documentation was just a set of pages in the wordpress blog I setup for the project. However, as time passes, new releases are out and I should update the online documentation to match the most recent release.p  pUnfortunately, if I do so, the docs for the previous releases will disappear as my doc pages are updated to the most recent version, therefore I decided to include the documentation in the release package emandem to keep the most recent documentation available online as a web page as well.p  pA trivial idea would be to wget the current docs from the wordpress pages, save them into the svn and therefore into the release package, repeating the procedure at every new release.

It works pretty well.p  pHowever, my service is getting very large. It has methodscallbacks to handle the game itself, but also the chat system, the loginregistration process, the matchmaking, the rosterplayer info, etc. Both the server and client are becoming hard to maintain because everything is tied into a single interface. On the client for example, I have to redirect the callbacks to either the game page, the lobby page, etc, and I find that very tedious. Id prefer being able to handle the game callbacks on the game page, the chat callbacks on the chat window, etc.p  pSo whats the best way to handle that Ive thought of many things, but not sure which is best splitting the service into multiple ones, having multiple endpoints on my service, or is there other tricks to implement a service partially where appropriate p  pThanksp

Negative 4446 pIm cutting my teeth on events and delegates today and to do so, I have been toying with the idea of experience bars, those progress bars from games. But I have a question about the better way to solve my problem  it could be as simple as bad design. Let me provide you some details.p  pI have modelled my idea with an ExperienceBar class.p  pIt contains propertiesp  ul liint StartValueli liint CurrentValueli liint EndValueli ul  pand a methodp  ul livoid UpdateBarintli ul  pUpdateBar adds the parameter to CurrentValue and then tests to see if it has reached EndValue. If it exceeds the amount, the EndValue increases and the amount continues on. Note that initially in my thinking, it is not concerned with the effects of reaching the maximum amount possible, just that the end value increases and the StartValue is reset to zero.p  pAnother class called Player has a property of class ExperienceBar.p  pIn my little demo, when Player.ExperienceBar.UpdateBarint reaches the EndValue it fires an event which is handled by the Player class. It updates the Player.Level property by one.p  pIve just realised that I could achieve the same thing by just changing UpdateBarint to return type true. This method could be tested by the Player class and when true, Player.Level increases by one.p  pSo my question  which is the best practice way to handle this rather specific circumstance As a general rule of thumb for these kind of situations, is it better to handle events, or is it better just to keep it simple with the testing of return statementsp  pPS I hope Ive made this clear as possible, but I can try to clarify if anyone is having trouble. I believe there may be some redundancies already with my idea, but try not to deviate from the question please. Im kind of aware of them Thank you p

Negative 4446 pI have come to a point in my 2D game  Im writing the whole engine myself for learning purposes , where I need to create some kind of class that Inherits from my GameEntity class that will contain Entities that actually move somehow in my game.p  pFor example, that class  MovableGameEntity  could contain an enemy, so it would have to be initialized with the Sprite Sheet movement frames for that particular enemy, and somehow the atributes for that enemy, like Energy, Speed , Strength , Defense..etc . But that class could also be the one that contains some kind of animated projectile thrown by some enemy or my main character, or a big falling rock, etc.p  pIm trying to figure out if this approach is fine, and if it is, try to make it pretty generic, maybe data driven, but wanted some insight or advice in how to do so. I dont want to end up with Enemy1 class Enemy 2 Class ... Enemy N class , etc etc.p  pSo any kind of advice or experience if someone already did something similar, is pretty welcome.p

Negative 4446 pI have a decent sized django project and when I originally built it I kept all the apps in an codeappscode folder under the project root. codeprojectappsarticlescode, codeprojectappsvideocode etc.p  pAfter a while I decided to move to best practices and make them more reusable so I moved them into their own separate apps then symlinkd them to my python path. each one is its own git repo as well.p  pThe only problem I run into is the annoyance of them being all in their own repo. This happens quite often that we decide to change something across many of the apps roughly 78 non3rd party apps. Like changing the name of something in the admin interface or incorporating something like south. I have to deal with each repo, commit, push, then have staging servers pull, then if all ok then have each app get pulled into production. Its just getting tiring. p  pSince I wrote all these apps they are all growing togeter with the site so there are many changes all the time. I hoping once everything starts to stablize maybe this issue will just go away since massive rapid changes wont be happening as much.p  pIs anyone else dealing with this. Ive incorporated pipfreeze and requirements files and using fabric to try to help with some of the repitition and while it helps its just getting tiring.p  pIs this the way other people are doing this as well Keeping their own apps which will probably way day be useful to other people as portatable independent apps. Im thinging of just pulling them in under the main project to speed up my work flow.p  pAny thoughts are appreciated. Maybe Im just being lazy.p

Instead of inventing my own template parser I thought I could create an aspx file in my project that is executed at runtime and, instead of viewing the output in a browser, I want a StreamReader or string object that holds the result.p  pIs that possible And if yes, how do I do thisp
Negative 4446 pI have a very simple queue implementation that wraps a fixed array. It contains peek, enqueue, and dequeue. If peek returns a reference, Ive found that it will return conflicting results eventually conflicting results meaning it will return 2 different values without any intervening dequeues or enqueues. Obviously, this could happen if that reference is held onto and modified, but as far as I can tell, it isnt. In fact, calling peek again gives the expected result.p  pBelow is the code with Windows threading and mutexes. Ive also tried this using pthreads on Linux with the same result. I obviously dont understand something... Ive dumped the executable and find the only difference between returning a reference or a value is when the memory location is dereferenced. For examplep  pIf a reference is returned, peek containsbr codelea         eax,[edxecx48]codebr And then in the consumer threadbr codecmp         dword ptr [eax],1code  p  pBut, if a value is returned, peek containsbr codemov         eax,dword ptr [edxecx48]codebr And then in the consumer threadbr codecmp         eax,1code  p  pThanksp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltwindows.hgt  typedef void threadfunctypevoid   void startthreadHANDLE ampthread, threadfunctype threadfunc, void arg      DWORD id     thread  CreateThreadNULL, 0, LPTHREADSTARTROUTINEthreadfunc, arg, 0, ampid     if thread  NULL          stdcerr ltlt ERROR failed to create threadn         exit1        void jointhreadHANDLE ampthread      WaitForSingleObjectthread, INFINITE   class ScopedMutex      HANDLE ampmutex  public      ScopedMutexHANDLE ampmutex  mutexmutex              WORD result  WaitForSingleObjectmutex, INFINITE         if result  WAITOBJECT0              stdcerr ltlt ERROR failed to lock mutexn             exit1                    ScopedMutex              ReleaseMutexmutex        template lttypename T, unsigned depthgt class Queue      unsigned head, tail     bool full     T data[depth]     HANDLE mutex  public      Queue  head0, tail0, fullfalse              mutex  CreateMutexNULL, 0, NULL         if mutex  NULL              stdcerr ltlt ERROR could not create mutex.n             exit1                    T amppeek              while true                               ScopedMutex locallockmutex                 if full  head  tail                     return data[tail]                          Sleep0                    void enqueueconst T ampt              while true                               ScopedMutex locallockmutex                 if full                      data[head]  t                     head  depth                     full  head  tail                     return                                           Sleep0                    void dequeue              while true                               ScopedMutex locallockmutex                 if full  head  tail                      tail                     tail  depth                     full  false                     return                                           Sleep0                 template ltunsigned numvals, int val, unsigned depthgt void  producervoid arg      Queueltint, depthgt ampqueue  staticcastltQueueltint, depthgt gtarg     for unsigned i  0 i lt numvals i          queue.enqueueval          stdcerr ltlt producer  ltlt val ltlt  exiting.n     return NULL   template ltunsigned numvals, int val, unsigned depthgt void  consumervoid arg      Queueltint, depthgt ampqueue  staticcastltQueueltint, depthgt gtarg     for unsigned i  0 i lt numvals i          while queue.peek  val             Sleep0         if queue.peek  val              stdcerr ltlt ERROR  ltlt val ltlt ,  ltlt queue.peek ltlt  ltlt stdendl             stdcerr ltlt But peeking again gives the right value  ltlt queue.peek ltlt stdendl             exit1                  queue.dequeue          return NULL   int mainint argc, char argv[]      const unsigned depth  10     const unsigned numvals  100000     Queueltint, depthgt queue     HANDLE p1, p2, c1, c2     startthreadp1, producerltnumvals, 1, depthgt, ampqueue     startthreadp2, producerltnumvals, 2, depthgt, ampqueue     startthreadc1, consumerltnumvals, 1, depthgt, ampqueue     startthreadc2, consumerltnumvals, 2, depthgt, ampqueue     jointhreadp1     jointhreadp2     jointhreadc1     jointhreadc2  codepre

Negative 4446 pThe litmus test for me for a good MVC implementation is how easy it is to swap out the view. Ive always done this really badly due to being lazy but now I want to do it right. This is in C but it should apply equally to nondesktop applications, if I am to believe the hype.p  pHere is one example the application controller has to check some URL for existence in the background. It may connect to the URL available event using Boost Signals as followsp  precodeBackgroundUrlCheckerThreadController amp controller      ...    signalUrlAvailable.connect       boostbindampControllerurlAvailable,ampcontroller,1  codepre  pSo what does codeControllerurlAvailablecode look likep  pHere is one possibilityp  precodevoid ControllerurlAvailableUrl url      ifviewgtaskUserURL available, wanna download it       return     else        Download the url in a new thread, repeat  codepre  pThis, to me, seems like a gross coupling of the view and the controller. Such a coupling makes it impossible to implement the view when using the web coroutines aside.p  pAnother possibilityp  precodevoid ControllerurlAvailableUrl url     urlAvailableSignalurl  Now, any view interested can do what it wants  codepre  pIm partial to the latter but it appears that if I do this there will bep  ol li40 billion such signals.

Negative 4446 pIm building a management system for an idea I have. Im well versed in PHP at least enough to do everything I need to do but Im not that experienced with using OOP. I use it as much as I can but a lot of the best practices Im not familiar with so when I do things I worry Im doing them in the wrong order.p  pFor this project I have a class for the thing the user is managing, I need to check whether or not the user has permissions to manage it. I know emhowem to check the permissions, my question is where should I be doing itp  pShould I be doing it outside the class, like sop  precodeif user permissions are valid initialize class else return error codepre  por should I be doingp  precodeinitialize class class checks permissions  class returns error if permissions are invalid codepre  pIm unsure which is the emcorrectem approach. On the one hand checking within the class seems the best based on what I know of OOP methodology, but then I also have the feeling that letting it get as far as initializing the class when permissions are unknown might be bad. p  pHow should I be doing it If theres any sort of article that covers this sort of thing a link would be greatly appreciated I cant find anything through searches but Im not 100 sure if Im searching for the right thing as I know little of OOPp

Im not too concerned with the accuracy of the passphrase.p  pI found a hrefhttpmysoftwaresolutions.blogspot.com201004getpassphrasefromwepkey.html relnofollowthis sitea, which has a Linux program that seems to work with values of keys generated by a hrefhttpwww.netpoint.comwep.htm relnofollowthis sitea supposedly the same WEP encryption engine, but unfortunately, it doesnt work with the key I have.p  pWhat Id like is a PerlC solution if someone has one.p  h3Things I realizeh3  ol liI know there will be several ascii options, since this is WEP the more the better, to help me find my original passphraseli liI know that WPAWPA2 is suggested as a better alternative to WEPli liI know that some routers have an http admin page 192.168.0.1, which may have the ascii passphrase thereli ol  h3Noteh3  ol lipI guess you could say this piggybacks on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3247023whatisthewepsharedkeyauthenticationalgorithmthis questiona, but its different since that one is asking about the authentication, whereas Im more concerned with the WEP algorithm itself.  pli lipThis is not for illegal hacking purposes.  Obtaining the WEP key would be illegal, since that is whats used in accessing a WEPenforced network.  Im merely asking how to convert that key to its English alternative.  I should also note that accessing another persons network and using their resources wo proper permission may be illegal.pli ol

Negative 4446 pI got a problem I cannot manage to resolve.p  pI have a Basecamp alike list of items with a small menu on the left with Drag, Edit and Trash icons. p  pThe handle is there. He is sitting outside of the scope of the sortable element, and this is why he doesnt influence the sorting at all.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comL4IQY.png altThe problem demonstrationp  pAs you can see, my dragging icon is on the left. He is outside of the LI scope. The LIs endings where the char ends, so the Handle is out from his parent and wont influence at all the sorting and wont initiate it.p  pWhen I drag it but move my mouse inside the LIs borders, than it influencing and sorting like it suppose to.p  pWhat can I do. I broke my head and searched for an property of an handle offset, or any way to define for him that my handle is outside of your scope.p  pI hope anyone faced this thing in the past and might help  I think to put a bullet image bg, and this way to give the LI more space to its left.

Negative 4446 pIm trying to figure out what is the best general design for applications that access several web services and have multiple activities where information is displayed.p  pThe way I implemented my latest Android application is the following. I have an codeIntentServicecode that receives requests from activities to get information from web services. My codeServicecode notifies the activities through a codeResultReceivercode about the status of the request startederrorfinished. After calling the web service, getting the resultxmljson and parsing it, I put that information in a codeContentProvidercode backed up by a sqlite database and use a codeContentResolvercode to notify any activities about the changes. The activities get notified about the changes some use codeContentObservercode and others use codeSimpleCursorAdaptercodes and are notified automatically.p  pNow, the problems with my approachp  ul lievery time I enter an activity, I request info from web service through the method described above and I delete all the rows in that particular table, fill it with the new info and notify the activity. So, if the user presses back and then enters again, I do the whole dance again. I think I should add some fields in the database for when was the last updated etc. but I dont know how exactly to proceed with that. Suggestions I think one alternative would be to use alarms and trigger updates at specific intervals. But in my case, the specification asks to check the web service every time I enter the activity.li liwhen I call the web service, I show a indeterminate progress bar in the activity, over the other views which contain the info fetched previously and that sits in the database until the web service call finishes but the user can start interacting with the views and this is not good the info may disappear from the database. Any way to disable the interaction A ProgressDialog comes to mind.li liif I move quickly through different activities, the IntentService is blocked with previous web service calls and it takes longer to get to my latest web service call. I could create multiple codeIntentServicecode for every web service but I dont think this is its purpose.li ul  pI have the feeling that the approach I have taken is not really the best one for this particular application. It is empartiallyem inspired from the Google IO application I couldnt understand everything, like the updated sqlite fields etc.. One alternative would have been to use AsyncTasks in all the activities. But where can I store the info in order to be accessed from other activities In lists in codeApplicationcode And how about id managementp  pIm really interested on your opinionsideassuggestions and how can I make my next applications work better and more efficiently.p

I cant seem to get an image stretched on the button, despite the fact that I followed the original instructions and a number of work arounds [1,2,3].p  pHow does one determine the error encountered in a Objective C method which returns void IMHO, a useless paradigm. Guessing at the culprit or error is a useless waste of time, and its not working well for me.p  pSorry about being snippy  I am at wits end, and I am tired of all the printfs, NSLogs, and  guessing.

Negative 4446 pException handling in php ... I have noticed some quirks that seem to  make it a tedious matter to implement properly.  First off, most legacy php functions do not throw exceptions per se, it seems one has to implement a hrefhttpwww.php.netmanualenfunction.seterrorhandler.php relnofollowseterrorhandlera and have the callback throw functions. Ok. Minor annoyance but lets see what gives. OH Great, now everything throws an exception, and of course, the worst part uncaught exceptions halt the script.p  pSo, kind of got to figure after reading the manual and other posts here, one has to implement a hrefhttpwww.php.netmanualenfunction.setexceptionhandler.php relnofollowsetexceptionhandlera, and also have the seterrorhandler callback to not throw on ENOTICE, EWARNING.p  pIS this correct so far After rereading the manpage, it seems setexceptionhandler halts the script on every error, even recoverable ones with emno wayem for the script to continue.p  pSo this seems a no no for me, I cant have scripts stop executing for notice or event warnings.  p  pAre there workarounds Im curious to know how others deal with exceptions and these issues.p

Negative 4446 pI have a windows azure deployment a webrole that on request pulls in a pair of video files mov and mp4 from azure storage into its own local IIS storage, which I then access through the browser. p  pIt may sound silly, but I have good reasons for doing this. p  pUnfortunately, I am unable to access the mp4 files. The mov are fine, but the mp4 give me 404  File or directory not found.p  pIve looked into this, and it seems to be because IIS will not return unknown file types, and mp4 must fall under this category. If it was a normal IIS server I would be able to register the mp4 mime type, but I dont know how to go about this in Windows Azure.p  pI could RDP in and do it manually, but this would not be practical as the role is replaced frequently and would mean I would need to redo it manually every time.

Negative 4446 pIm attempting to write an XML schema to define some model classes to be used in jaxb in java.p  pI would like to be able to define an interface in the xsd but Ive no idea how to do this.p  pFor example a lot of my classes will have an attribute called id which is type xsID. They will have an attribute called ref which is type xsIDREF and they will have an attribute called extRef which means that there is a refrence but the element is not specified in the given xml file. p  pIdeally this would be an interface when converted to java for two reasons. p  ol liThe classes that implement this are not necessarily connected.li liI would like to specify a different inheritance tree for some of these objects.li ol  pExamplep  precodelt Utility type to be externally referenceable this is too keep all the      externally refrencable attributes in check gt ltxscomplexType nameExternallyReferenceable abstracttruegt     ltxsattribute nameextRef typeexternalReference gt     ltxsattribute nameid typexsID gt     ltxsattribute nameref typexsIDREF gt ltxscomplexTypegt  ltxscomplexType nameExternalCarPartgt     ltxsextension base ExternallyReferenceable gt ltxscomplexTypegt  ltxscomplexType nameCarPartgt     ltxsextension base ExternalCarPartgt                      ltxssequencegt                              ltxselement typexsstring namepartName gt                      ltxssequencegt     ltxsextensiongt ltxscomplexTypegt  ltxscomplexType nameCarLampgt     ltxsextension base ExternalCarPartgt                      ltxssequencegt                              ltxselement typexsstring nameglassPurity gt                      ltxssequencegt             ltxsextensiongt ltxscomplexTypegt codepre  pSo in the above example it would be better if exteranllyRefrencable was an interface, and if carpart was an interface.p  pThis would allow CarLamp to inherit from lamp rather than external car part. BicycleLamp could also implement the externallyRefrencable interface and extend lamp also.p  pPlease ask me for clarification if the question isnt clear.p

Negative 4446 pI have an application set up using jaas module for login. There are ajax function calls in the application so I am experencing the notorious ajax session timeout problem, which means a ugly login page is getting into a pages place holder if session is timeout. I am now fixing it in an ugly way by checking if the return ajax result contains the login form, but apparently, this is not a good way.p  pI tried to add a filter to check if session has timed out and return something meaningful for ajax request. But it seems that jaas runs prior to servlet filters. I have checked and acknowledged valve is some kind of interceptor which runs before jaas. It seems to be the thing I needed.But its containerbase not applicationbased, which is not so applicationfrieldly IMO. So I am asking if this is the only way to fulfil what I am trying to do or are there any better alternatives. p  pI am using Jboss AS 4.2.3p  pThanks.p

Negative 4446 pIn our application we use the repository pattern to retrieve and persist data from our data storage medium. The medium we opted to use is Entity Framework 4. This seems to be a very clean way to do things and has worked great 99 of the time.p  pNow we are encountering an issue. We have two repositories, like thisp  precodepublic class UserRepository  IUserRepository      Entities dataContext  new Entities      public User GetUserstring username              return dataContext.Users.SingleOrDefaultx gt x.Username  username            ... more CRUDstyle methods that are not relevant to this question.      public void SaveChanges              dataContext.SaveChanges        public RoleRepository  IRoleRepository      Entities dataContext  new Entities      public Role GetRolestring name              return dataContext.Roles.SingleOrDefaultx gt x.Name  name            ... more CRUDstyle methods that are not relevant to this question.      public void SaveChanges              dataContext.SaveChanges       codepre  pUsers and Roles actually have a many to many relationship in the Entity Framework model. Sometimes we want to take an existing user and an existing role and associate the two. Normally this would work great if you do a short sample code snippet like thisp  precodeEntities dataContext  new Entities Role roleToAdd  dataContext.Roles.Singlex gt x.Name  Admin User user  dataContext.Users.Singlex gt x.Username  Fred user.Roles.AddroleToAdd dataContext.SaveChanges codepre  pThis works great because both entities are being retrieved from the same EF data context object. However, in our application each repository creates its own data context object. So when we try to do the same as the above with our own architecturep  precodeUserRepository userRepo  new UserRepository RoleRepository roleRepo  new RoleRepository User user  userRepo.GetUserFred Role roleToAdd  roleRepo.GetRoleAdmin user.Roles.AddroleToAdd userRepo.SaveChanges codepre  pWe get this errorp  blockquote   pThe relationship between the two objects cannot be defined because they are attached to different ObjectContext objects.p blockquote  pWhat is the best way to centralize this data context Obviously I dont want to duplicate a GetRole method within the UserRepository because that would be redundant and silly. I could just do a more verbose method on the UserRepository that takes in a username and a rolename, then uses the same data context to retrieve and associate them, like thisp  precodepublic void AddUserToRolestring username, string role      User user  dataContext.Users.Singlex gt x.Username  username     Role roleToAdd  dataContext.Roles.Singlex gt x.Name  role     user.Roles.AddroleToAdd  codepre  pI could then just dop  precodeuserRepo.AddUserToRoleFred, Admin userRepo.SaveChanges codepre  pBut is that the best way to accomplish this Is there a better way to centralize the EF data context on each request so that all repositories use the same one instead of creating their own If so, how would I do thatp  pAny help is appreciated.p

Negative 4446 pIm having a great time learning Python, but Ive just gotten a bit stuck on trying to incorporate a recursive function into SQLAlchemy.  p  pEssentially, have a function which creates a instance of a class to be put in the database.

Negative 4446 pIm creating a community site with Node.JS and Express and almost all express tutorials or examples use MongoDB, so I checked it out. The only DB I used so far is MySQL but Im not that much familiar with it so it wouldnt bother me to read into MongoDB. Mongo looks quite nice and the document model might be beneficial. And with mongoose its easy to use. But I got some questions so I dont spend a lot of time learning to use MongoDB if it doesnt fit at allp  ol lipIve read that MongoDB is unreliable if you use it on only one machine and you might encounter data loss. Is that right The project is not that big that I could afford another server and data loss is totally a no go Imagine some forum posts just disappear. But I guess people wouldnt use it if that happens.pli lipThe site will contain a selfbuild forum and Im not sure if a relational db would be better. However you could save threads with embedded posts and so on. But no idea how to search as Mongo doesnt support full text search. What do you thinkpli lipWhen to use embedded documents in Mongo Example A user can post status updates like on Twitter. Would you save these updates in the user document Can be a lot of updates. Or a document per update and link it to the user id 3.1 And how to query across multiple documents You want to fetch the last 10 status updates of your friends. You can do that with JOINs in MySQL.pli lipIs there a way to use autoincremental IDs for documents like in MySQL A user for example should have a unique integer key but I dont want some random number like Mongo does it, in order keep the user IDs small.pli lipHow do you handle race condition in mongoose You load a document from db, edit something and save it later. But maybe it has already changed in the mean time.pli ol

Negative 4446 pI have a function that I need to call whenever a page is displayed, whether that is through a standard page load or through jQuery Mobiles AJAX navigation mechanism.  Currently, my code works without issue, but I feel like there is a more elegant way.p  pIn the footer of my page I have some code that attaches to the codepageshowcode event for that page.  On codepageshowcode it will focus on a textbox, do an alert for testing, and then unbind itself from the codepageshowcode event.

Negative 4446 pIm working on constructing a database SQLite to store information about each run of a Mathematica script Ive written. The script takes several input parameters, so my DB has a table with a column for each parameter among other columns.p  pSome of the input parameters are emlistsem of numbers. My first thought for storing these is to use a junction table as described in the accepted answer to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions444251howtostorealistinadbcolumnthis questiona. But I typically use the same list for several different runs. strongHow can I look up whether any given list is already in the databasestrong, so I can reuse its ID rather than storing it againp  pConstraints as mentioned in commentsp  ul liThere is no explicit upper bound on the length of a list but in practice it ranges from 1 to about 50.li liThe number of distinct lists will be small, on the order of 10.li liI actually have 3 list parameters. For two of them, the values in the list are nonnegative, double precision floating point numbers for the third, the values are pairs of such numbers.li liThere are no duplicate entries. These are more precisely emsetsem, so no duplicates and order is irrelevantli liI can easily arrange for the list elements to be in sorted order.li ul  hr  pFor example suppose my table is set up like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE jobs id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, param1 REAL, param2id INTEGER CREATE TABLE param2 param2id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, value REAL codepre  pWhen I run the script, it sets the parameters and then calls a function to run the calculation, like sop  precodeparam1  4 param2  .1, .3, .5 runTheCalculation[param1, param2] codepre  pAssuming this is the very first run of the script, it will insert the following contents into the DBp  precodejobs   id      param1     param2id          1       4.0        1  param2 param2id   value          1           0.1          1           0.3          1           0.5 codepre  pSo far, so good. Now lets say I run the script again with one different parameter,p  precodeparam1  2 param2  .1, .3, .5 runTheCalculation[] codepre  pIn a naive implementation, this will result in the database containing thisp  precodejobs   id      param1     param2id          1       4.0        1          2       2.0        2  param2 param2id   value          1           0.1          1           0.3          1           0.5          2           0.1          2           0.3          2           0.5 codepre  pBut I would like it to be able to look up the fact that the list code.1, .3, .5code is already in the database, so that after the second run the DB contains this insteadp  precodejobs   id      param1     param2id          1       4.0        1          2       2.0        1  param2 param2id   value          1           0.1          1           0.3          1           0.5 codepre  pWhat sort of a query can I use to find that the list code.1, .3, .5code already exists in the table codeparam2codep  pIm not opposed to creating additional tables if necessary.

Negative 4446 pstrongEdit 4strong It turns out that this is actually just a limitation of TTY input in general theres nothing specific about OCaml, Coq, or Emacs which is causing the problem.p  hr  pIm working on a Coq program using Proof General in Emacs, and Ive found a bug with input thats too long.  If a region to submit to codecoqtopcode through Proof General contains more than 1023 characters, Proof General though not Emacs hangs while waiting for a response, and the codecoqcode buffer contains one extra codeGcode character for every character over 1023.  For instance, if a 1025character region was sent to codecoqtopcode, then the codecoqcode buffer would end with the two extra characters codeGGcode.  I cant proceed past this point in the file, and I have to kill the codecoqtopcode process either with kbdCc Cxkbd or a codekillcodecodekillallcode from the terminal.p  pSomething about this limitation arises from codecoqtopcode itself.  If one generates a 1024character or longer string and pipes it in, such as by runningp  precodeperl e print Eval simpl in  .   x 1024 . 1.n  coqtop codepre  pthen everything works fine.  Similarly, codecoqccode works fine as well.  emHoweverem, if I run codecoqtopcode in a terminal, I cant type more than 1024 characters on one line, emincludingem the ending return character.  Thus, typing a 1023character line and then hitting return works but after typing 1024 characters, hitting any key, including return but not including delete, etc., does nothing but produce a beep.  And it turns out that codeocamlcode the OCaml toplevel has the same behaviorp  precodeperl e print   x 1024 . 1  ocaml codepre  pworks fine, but I cant type more than 1024 characters on one line if running codeocamlcode from a terminal.  Since my understanding is that codecoqtopcode relies on the OCaml toplevel more obviously when run as codecoqtop bytecode, I imagine this is a related limitation.p  pThe relevant software versions arep  ul lia hrefhttpcaml.inria.frocaml relnofollowOCamla 3.12.1 from a hrefhttpmxcl.github.comhomebrew relnofollowHomebrewali lia hrefhttpcoq.inria.fr relnofollowCoqa 8.3pl3 and 8.3pl2 from a hrefhttpmxcl.github.comhomebrew relnofollowHomebrewali lia hrefhttpproofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk relnofollowProof Generala 4.1li liThe build of a hrefhttpwww.gnu.orgsoftwareemacs relnofollowGNU Emacsa 24.1.1 from a hrefhttpemacsformacosx.com relnofollowEmacs for Mac OS Xa andli liMac OS X 10.6.7.li ul  pAnd my questions arep  ul liWhat about codeocamlcode and codecoqtopcode is enforcing this character limit  And why only for input from the terminal or Emacs, as opposed to input from a pipe or a fileli liWhy does Proof Generals apparent ignorance of this limit cause hanging errors and mysterious codeGcodesli liHow can I work around this limitation  My end goal is to use Coq inside Proof GeneralEmacs, so workarounds which dodge the underlying issue are fine.li ul  hr  pstrongEdit 3strong After finding that the 1024character input limitation also exists in the Ocaml toplevel something which I imagine is related, Ive added that information and deleted the original problem description, as its been completely obscured and superseded.

Negative 4446 pI would imagine that the overall answers to this will push me over to Functional Reactive Programming, but... bear with me for a bit.p  pI also dont have example code for this question.  I have wandered near the topic with some of my code, but I have stayed firmly in the IO monad with it.p  pImagine that I have an application in which I am modelling somewhat complex state and put it into an overall Application State monad.  I am doing it this way because I am wanting a certain level of detachment between my core application and the particular user interface.p  precodedata S  S DataStore EventStream Sockets type AppState m  StateT S m codepre  passume that DataStore, EventStream, and Sockets are all data types that do basically what they sound like p  pNow, say I want to create a table in GTK TreeView, but no child nodes that views only the EventStream.  I have already learned to do that by saying codelistStoreNew eventstream gtgt treeViewNewWithModelcode see a hrefhttpmarkus.alyra.orgp1023 relnofollowhttpmarkus.alyra.orgp1023a where I talked pretty extensively about the mechanics of setting this up.p  pBut, now I have a emmutable copyem of data that is in my AppState monad.  When the application goes off and does something that appends new data to the EventStream, that will not show up in the view.  The only way I can think of it make it show up in the view is to send it over with a message like codelistStoreInsert myneweventcode in addition to the changes made to the monad.  Thats doable, but is starting to feel clumsy.p  pWorse, though, this mythical tree view is an administrative view  Its emeditableem  The admin says oh, that event has some invalid data, I want to change it.  Now, I have no problems changing the data that is in the ListStore I created above.  I can create callbacks that make the update with no problem.  But I cannot think at all of how to get the update into the Global AppState Monad.p  pAnd those last few words show the core of the problem.  If I have a global AppState Monad, then anything that updates that monad has to be in one line of execution with everything that wants to view the monad.  The TreeView breaks that.  When a cell gets edited in the TreeView monad, the edit handler runs entirely in the IO monad and is expected to return nothing.  The end data type is codeIO code.  Even if I had some nifty way to unwrap data from my AppState, then do the edit handler, and then rewrap the data in my AppState, no other branch of the application could see it.p  pEven if I can figure out how to create my own completely custom ModelView instance that provides a readonly view into my AppState, I cannot think of how to make state updates available to the rest of the application.p  pSo...p  pIs it even possible to model GTKHaskell application in this way  Or, have I gone down the road to madnessp

Negative 4446 h2The Problemh2  pThis is a very simpletounderstand question.p  pIm having a user submit a URL, for example httpexample.compathfilename.html.p  pIm using PHPs codedirnamecode function to get the socalled base of this URL. For the above example, that would be httpexample.compath.p  pMy problem arises when the user enters thisp  precodehttpexample.comblog codepre  pIf you type the above into your browser, you will see the index.php or .html page in the folder called blog. However, PHPs codedirnamecode will return only httpexample.com.p  pIm not sure if it thinks that blog is an extensionless file, if that exists, but I cant really find a solution.p  h2Things Ive Triedh2  pI first tried getting the extension of the URL using this quick methodp  precodeurl  httpexample.comindex.php fileextension  endexplode., filename codepre  pThen, I would check if the extension existed using PHP codeemptycode. If the extension exists, that means that a filename was entered after the folder, such as httpexample.compathfile.html, and codedirnamecode is perfect. If the extension doesnt exist, no file was entered and the last item in the path is a folder, so it is already the base.p  pHowever, in the case of simply httpexample.compath, the above would return .compath as the file extension, which we all know doesnt exist. In this case, I would use the codedirnamecode function and cut off path.p  pEDITp  pTaking the extension of codebasenameurlcode wont work because if the user enters httpexample.com codebasenamecode returns example.com, the extension for which is supposedly  .comp  h3Hopefully, someone has had the same problem and knows the solution. Im still looking, but any answers are wholly appreciatedh3

Negative 4446 pnbspnbspnbspnbspIm attempting to build a golf game tracking program that uses a canvas to hold an arranged set of buttons and databound items for each player. Because the number of people in a game is dynamic, I need to be able to build the canvases on the fly and bind them on the fly as well. the problem Im having is setting up the databinding. If I attempt to bind in code then the text for the binding textBinding always comes out as though it were a string literal instead of an actual binding. To get around this I attempted to build a template of the canvas, but I cant find a way to actually apply the template to a new canvas as I build out new players.p  pnbspnbspnbspnbspSo with all that in mind, what is the best way to either A build a template canvas with all my controls so I can just copy and bind to each player, or B build the text bindings dynamically without having to resort to XAMLp  pEdit The following was added for clarification on how Im creating a textblock. p  precodeTextBlock newBlock  new TextBlock                      Text  Binding,             FontSize  42,             DataContext  Player.SomeStat,             Name  Player.PlayerName ,           codepre  ppThe value shown on the screen for the textblock instead of what it should be is Bindingp

Negative 4446 pIve noticed that Java String will reuse char array inside it to avoid creating new char array for a new String instance in method such as subString. There are several unpublish constructors in String for this purpose, accepting a char array and two int as range to construct a String instance. p  pBut until today I found that split will also reuse the char arr of original String instance. Now I read a loooooong line from a file, split it with ,  and cut a very limit column for real usage.

Negative 4446 pThe most convenient, Pythonic way to remove duplicates from a list is basicallyp  precodemylist  listsetmylist codepre  pBut suppose your criteria for counting a duplicate depends on a particular member field of the objects contained in codemylistcode.p  pWell, one solution is to just define codeeqcode and codehashcode for the objects in codemylistcode, and then the classic codelistsetmylistcode will work.p  pBut sometimes you have requirements that call for a bit more flexibility.  It would be very convenient to be able to create onthefly lambdas to use custom comparison routines to identify duplicates in different ways.  Ideally, something likep  precodemylist  listsetmylist, key  lambda x x.firstname codepre  pOf course, that doesnt actually work because the codesetcode constructor doesnt take a compare function, and codesetcode requires hashable keys as well.p  pSo whats the closest way to achieve something like that, so that you can remove duplicates using arbitrary comparison functionsp

RFC 2616 has this to say on idempotencep  blockquote   pMethods can also have the property of idempotence in that aside from error or expiration issues the sideeffects of N  0 identical requests is the same as for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE share this property. RFC 2616 section 9.1.2p blockquote  pIm not clear on the side effects are the same qualifier. Does that mean it can be a repeat of the same side effect, or a net0 effectp  pAnd then...  weve been allowing forward revisions, that is, creating a new version that is not yet the default version, but will be. How does that play into idempotence and PUT If a new revision is created, then repeating the PUT is not a noop. Rather, it would create yet another revision. The spec saysp  blockquote   pA single resource MAY be identified by many different URIs. For example, an article might have a URI for identifying the current version which is separate from the URI identifying each particular version. In this case, a PUT request on a general URI might result in several other URIs being defined by the origin serverp blockquote  pPut another wayp  pcodePUT node5 title Hello worldcodep  pResults inp  ul lipcodeGET node5 title Hello worldcodepli lipcodeGET node5revision8 title Hello worldcodepli ul  pAnd thats totally fine, by my read of the spec.

Negative 4446 pI just designed an admin console for a social networking website. My boss now wants me to cache the results of several MySQL queries that build these results for 24 hours. The site uses Memcached with Wordpress W3 total cache and XCache.

Whats the best way to solve this problem Can SQL itself be told to remember certain queries like this, or is memory caching the way to gop  pThanksp
Negative 4446 pIm working in ASP.NET 2.0 and we have a page where a user is able to select and download a series of files as a zip.  I got this to work without undo difficulty by using the DotNetZip library which is probably not relevant to the problem, but included for completeness.p  pAfter the user checks which files they want to download, the page does a postback, and in the button click event handler, I use the following codep  precode    Response.Clear     Response.BufferOutput  false  false  stream immediately     Response.ContentType  applicationzip     Response.AddHeadercontentdisposition, filenameFileRequest.zip      using ZipFile zip  new ZipFile              zip.AddFileMapPathdatafilesfileToZip.pdf,          zip.SaveResponse.OutputStream          Response.Close codepre  pAnd this all seems to work great.  The user clicks the button, a download window pops up, the user downloads the zip.  All is good...p  p...until they decide they want to do something else on the page.  The buttons in the form are no longer responsive.  For instance, if I click the download button again, it does nothing.  If I reload the page, I can repeat this behavior...it works once, then does nothing.p  pIm not understanding why the browser doesnt send the new request.  Its not spinning or otherwise acting busy.  I thought that this might be a browser issue, but Ive repeated it in both IE and Firefox, so it seems likely that its something Im not understanding.

Nothing appears to be happening.  This is my first time using codeltdatabaseobjectgtcode so I may be doing something wrong here.p  pIm guessing INCLUDE is Sql Server specific which is why the dialectscope is there.  I know how to create a single and multicolumn index, but this is not what I want.  I want a single column index on zipcode and all other columns in the User table part of the INCLUDE clause of the query.  Is there any way to create this type of index using the mapping file or some other way  p  pThis is probably a long shot, but it would be nice to not have to specify every column but the indexed one in the INCLUDE part of the query...  Instead to just let nhibernate add any new columns to the index that are added as properties to the mapping file.p

Negative 4446 pWhat I want is to be able to act on specific updates to a users feed  When someone else comments on a users postphotolink, someone else comments on a comment, someone else likes comment or post by my user, tags a user in a photo, etc.  In these cases we notify the user of the exact change that occurred so we need to know exactly what changedhappened and act on it.p  pI have realtime working, challenge handled, checking sha1 signature, etc.   The update itself just tells me essentially User As feed has changed.  What I wish I got was These are the changes since last time.p  pI can think of a couple ways to go about this but they all seem pretty heavy handedp  ul liKeep a copy of each users feed with each update, manually diff by iterating over each key, decide if the changes I detect are changes I need to act on.   Im still not sure this would even work because I only see the last few posts.  Do commentslikes of a post reorder that post to the frontli liTrack the timestamp of the most recent change in every update, then filter by that in subsequent updates.   This still means I have to iterate over every postcommentlike in the entire feed.li liI read somewhere that postcomment ids increase monotonically.  Is that true per users feed  For comments is that just local to the post  Do postscommentslikes share an id pool so I could rely on this globally   Again not sure about a lot of details here but in that case I could track the highest id seen in one update, and filter on that in subsequent updates.li ul  pAnyway, all these seem very brute force.  Specific advice or methods are much appreciated.   Thanks.p

Negative 4446 pIm porting some OpenMP parallelized loops to GCD for use on iOS. Ive encountered a construct that Im not sure how best to model.p  pThe OpenMP loop does some nontrivial operations on a shared state block, of which it allocates one per possible OpenMP thread, and then combines reduces, in effect the results after the loop. Like this simplifiedp  precodeconst int maxthreads  ompgetmaxthreads stateblock state[maxthreads]  pragma omp parallel for sharedstate  forunsigned int i  0 i lt somecount i       do some stuff     updatestatestate[ompgetthreadnum]   mergestatedatastate, maxthreads codepre  pGCD doesnt offer a way to know what the max number of possible threads are does it or which one youre currently on, so this pattern doesnt work. The state block is nontrivial in size, and the iteration count is large, so allocating one for every iteration of the loop as a pure worst case isnt plausible either.p  pIts conceivable that I could use a custom dispatch source with codeDISPATCHSOURCETYPEDATAADDcode to do the state update, but there would be thousands of sources required if I atomized it like that, and that seems wrong.p  pIs there something Im missing, either with GCD or generally in the design herep  pThanks.p

Negative 4446 pI created a webservice that includes a method that returns an array of objects.

I get both objects containing the correct values.p  pNow when I create the stub classes by using wsimport and then create a testclient that calls that function I do get a list back that contains 2 items, just as expected. However, when I want to print out the values of the fields of the objects they are empty, i.e. integer value is 0 and string value is null.p  pAny suggestions on what the issue could be I would assume there is some kind of error happening when I create the classes with wsimport..p

Every one of them is places on the page with a different img tag enveloped in an anchor with its own href. The zindex property of the img is used to make them overlap in the right way. The cylinder has to be composed because it is dynamically created, as you can see from the image, its faces can have different colors.p  pWhat i need to do is to make all the faces clickable and each one has to point to a different URL.p  pMy problem is, of course, that the cylinder has curves. And i have to be sure that the clicks points to the correct URL especially near the curves, it hasnt to be precise at pixel level, but at least acceptable.p  pIve tried to use a map with a single area for each of the images that composes the cylinder,  but of course it didnt work, as i saw from the specifications, in such cases only the first declared map in the DOM works.p  pIm thinking about to solve this via Javascript, but i think it wouldnt be an easy job, so i would be happy if someone can give me some advice on what should i try.p  pOh, i cannot use HTML5 features to solve this.p

Negative 4446 pIm making my first android application and Im trying to use a db4o database.p  pIn general it is structured like this You have a Person class with some inheritance to differentiate between boss, employee, intern,... but that doesnt really matter here I guess.br You also have the Taskclass. A Task object has among other attributes an ArrayList with Persons. A task can exist without persons assigned, and vice versa. p  pThe problem Im having is that db4o doesnt seem to keep track of my objects. So when I try to attach a Person loaded from the database with a query to a Task, the Person gets duplicated. So for now Ive solved this by doing a QBE on the Person object, and adding the returned object to the Task. But this seems very wrongp  pSo somewhere the reference to my object is lost... Im keeping the database connection open the whole time only closing it onDestroy. p  pThis is a sample action  I have an activity in which I fill in some attributes for the Task, and then I use an ActivityForResult in which I select and return the Personobject trough an intent from a ListView.

Wherever the icons are is a product, and if an icon is clicked, an external .SWF loads with the product information. In a perfect world, the icon wouldnt zoom, only pan. p  pMy base understanding is that each of the icons would have to be a separate movieclip. Each with its own set of listeners.  I just cant figure out how to make the icons stay on the relevant product when the main image is panned and zoomed.p  pAny help or advise would be greatly appreciated.p  pa hrefhttpwww.marketingfanatics.co.zaimagesexample.jpg relnofollowhttpwww.marketingfanatics.co.zaimagesexample.jpgap  precodepackage    import flash.display.MovieClip import fl.motion.MatrixTransformer import flash.display.Sprite import flash.display.Shape import flash.display.Bitmap import flash.display.Loader import flash.net.URLRequest import flash.events.ProgressEvent import flash.events.Event import flash.events.MouseEvent import flash.filters.DropShadowFilter import flash.geom.Matrix import flash.geom.Point import flash.events.KeyboardEvent import flash.ui.Mouse  public class Main extends MovieClip        public function Main           mcIn.visible  false         mcOut.visible  false         infoBox.wordWrap  true         infoBox.mouseEnabled  false          var boardSprite  new Sprite         addChildboard          var boardWidthint  690         var boardHeightint  489          board.x  0.0         board.y  0.0           board.graphics.beginFill0xDDDDDD         board.graphics.drawRect0, 0, boardWidth, boardHeight         board.graphics.endFill          var spImageSprite  new Sprite         board.addChildspImage          var boardMaskShape  new Shape         boardMask.graphics.beginFill0xDDDDDD         boardMask.graphics.drawRect0, 0, boardWidth, boardHeight         boardMask.graphics.endFill         board.addChildboardMask         spImage.mask  boardMask          var scaleFactorNumber  0.8         var minScaleNumber  0.25         var maxScaleNumber  2.0         var imageBitmap          var loaderLoader  new Loader         loader.loadnew URLRequestsourcematerialIrrigation1195X847.jpg         loader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListenerEvent.COMPLETE, initPic         loader.contentLoaderInfo.addEventListenerProgressEvent.PROGRESS, updateInfo         infoBox.text  Loading the Image          function updateInfoeProgressEventvoid              infoBox.text  Loading   StringMath.floore.bytesLoaded1024   KB of   StringMath.floore.bytesTotal1024   KB.                   function initPiceEventvoid              infoBox.text               infoBox.visible  false             image  Bitmaploader.content             minScale  boardWidthimage.width             image.scaleX  minScale             image.scaleY  minScale              spImage.addChildimage             spImage.addChildmcIn             spImage.addChildmcOut              spImage.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEDOWN, startDragging             stage.addEventListenerMouseEvent.MOUSEUP, stopDragging              loader.contentLoaderInfo.removeEventListenerEvent.COMPLETE, initPic             loader.contentLoaderInfo.removeEventListenerProgressEvent.PROGRESS, updateInfo             loader  null              board.filters  [ new DropShadowFilter ]             spImage.addEventListenerMouseEvent.CLICK, zoom                   function startDraggingmevMouseEventvoid              spImage.startDrag                   function stopDraggingmevMouseEventvoid              spImage.stopDrag                   function zoommevMouseEventvoid              if mev.shiftKey ampamp mev.ctrlKey                  return                           if mev.shiftKey ampamp mev.ctrlKey                  return                           var matMatrix              var externalCenterPoint  new PointspImage.mouseX, spImage.mouseY             var internalCenterPoint  new Pointimage.mouseX, image.mouseY              if mev.shiftKey                  image.scaleX  Math.maxscaleFactor  image.scaleX, minScale                 image.scaleY  Math.maxscaleFactor  image.scaleY, minScale                            if mev.ctrlKey                  image.scaleX  Math.min1  scaleFactor  image.scaleX, maxScale                 image.scaleY  Math.min1  scaleFactor  image.scaleY, maxScale                            mat  image.transform.matrix.clone              MatrixTransformer.matchInternalPointWithExternalmat, internalCenter, externalCenter              image.transform.matrix  mat                   stage.addEventListenerKeyboardEvent.KEYDOWN, keyHandler         stage.addEventListenerKeyboardEvent.KEYUP, keyHandler          function keyHandlerkeKeyboardEventvoid              mcIn.x  spImage.mouseX             mcIn.y  spImage.mouseY              mcOut.x  spImage.mouseX             mcOut.y  spImage.mouseY              mcIn.visible  ke.ctrlKey             mcOut.visible  ke.shiftKey              if ke.ctrlKey  ke.shiftKey                  Mouse.hide  else                      Mouse.show                             codepre  pp

On Safari it sends neither IfModifiedSince nor IfNoneMatch, and as youd expect, it then fully reloads the page from the server. I am seeing this on Safari 6.0.3 on my MacBook Pro, Safari in the iOS Simulator using an iPhone with iOS 6.1, and on an iPad Mini with iOS 6.1.3.p  pAnd whats really strange about this is that Safari clearly supports Conditional Get for subsequent requests CSS, JS, images, etc  I can see them clearly after the main HTML page comes through.

This also works with any value type including codestructcode.p  pHowever, this is strongONLYstrong the case with arrays.

Is this a limitation of PhantomJSGhostDriver or does the driver require a parameter Im missing to execute the script. I do have p  precode    caps.setJavascriptEnabledtrue  codepre  pset in my setup method. Though I belive as of 1.9 Javascript is enabled by default. So does this piece not work at all for GhostDriver or is there something Im missingp

Negative 4446 pIm confused about how to model my relationship in Entity Framework.p  pI want codeClassAcode to optionally point to a codeClassBcode. That sounds kind of like an optional onetoone relationship.p  pI also want codeClassBcode to always point to the ClassA that points to it. I also want to permit multiple codeClassBcodes to refer to the same codeClassAcode. That sounds like a onetomany relationship.p  pIs this best modelled as one relationship, or is this really two completely separate relationshipsp  pIf its two relationships can they share the single property ClassAKey which appears on ClassB to be used to refer to codeClassAcodep  pIn my problem its clear in my head what I want my OM to bep  precodeClassA      [Key]     int Key  get set      ClassB Maybe  get set      int MaybeKey  get set    ClassB      [Key]     int Key  get set      ClassA Always  get set      int AlwaysKey  get set   codepre  pIts also clear in my head what that should look like in the DB there should be just a codeClassAKeycode column for codeClassBcode and a codeClassBKeycode column for codeClassAcode so that each can refer to each other, and foreign key relationships on these columns.p  pBut... Im not clear on what the way to model this in EF is.

Negative 4446 pI have a codessiscode project with 3 codessiscode packages, one is a parent package which calls the other 2 packages based on some condition. In the parent package I have a foreach loop container which will read multiple code.csvcode files from a location and based on the file name one of the two child packages will be executed and the data is uploaded into the tables present in MS SQL Server 2008. Since multiple files are read, if any of the file generates an error in the the child packages, I have to log the details of error like the filename, error message, row number etc in a custom database table, delete all the records that got uploaded in the table and read the next file and the package should not stop for the files which are valid and doesnt generate any error when they are read.p  pSay if a file has 100 rows and there is a problem at row number 50, then we need to log the error details in a table, delete rows 1 to 49 which got uploaded in the database table and the package to start executing the next file.p  pHow can I achieve this in SSISp

Then we switched to Unicode.  Things work well in English, but fail in Asian languages, apparently because Windows conversion functions codeWideCharToMultiBytecode and codeMultiByteToWideCharcode take an explicit code page not a locale ID or language ID, which can be set to CPACP default to ANSI code page, but dont appear to have a value for default to users default interface langages code page.p  pI mean, this is some seriously convoluted twaddle.  Four separate dimensions of current language, three different identifier types, as well as different stringidentifiers for C library and C standard library.p  pIn our previous MBCS builds, disk IO and user IO worked correctly everything remained in the DEFAULT SYSTEM LOCALE Windows XP term Language for nonUnicode Programs.  But now, in our UNICODE builds, everything tries to use C as the locale, and file IO fails to properly transcode UNICODE to users locale, and vice verse.p  pWe want to have text files written out when narrow using the current users langauges code page.  And when read in, the current users languages code page should be converted back to UNICODE.p  pHelpp  pemClarification I would ideally like to use the MUI language code page rather than the OS default code page.  GetACP returns the system default code page, but I am unaware of a function that returns the users chosen MUI language which autoreverts to system default if no MUI specified  installed.emp

At the end, I will start over with the first row again.p  pAt first I was thinking that there might be a SQL language construct such as OPTIMIZE FOR n ROWS or FETCH FIRST n  or some combination of both.p  pI found a hrefhttppic.dhe.ibm.cominfocenterdzichelpv2r2index.jsptopic2Fcom.ibm.db2z10.doc.sqlref2Fsrc2Ftpc2Fdb2zsqlorderbyclause.htm relnofollowthisa which says p  pemYou can specify a large value of n in the OPTIMIZE FOR n ROWS clause of a SELECT statement to increase the number of DRDA query blocks that a DB2 server returns in each network transmission for a non scrollable cursor.emp  pBut now I am thinking there may be more complexity to getting down to what I want.p  pDo you guys have any suggestions for creating this type of behaviorp

I also did a promptparamID and paramID is correct so I dont understand whats going on. Any help would be greatly appreciated Its probably something stupid I did on my part. Ive tried firefox and chrome...p  pHere is my codep  precodelttable idtictable border1   lttr idrow1gt lttdgtltbutton idbutton1 typebutton onclickactionPerformedthis.idltbuttongtlttdgt lttdgtltbutton idbutton2 typebutton onclickactionPerformedthis.idltbuttongtlttdgt lttdgtltbutton idbutton3 typebutton onclickactionPerformedthis.idltbuttongtlttdgt lttrgt   lttr gt lttdgtltbutton idbutton4 typebutton onclickactionPerformedthis.idltbuttongtlttdgt lttdgtltbutton idbutton5 typebutton onclickactionPerformedthis.idltbuttongtlttdgt lttdgtltbutton idbutton6 typebutton onclickactionPerformedthis.idltbuttongtlttdgt lttrgt   lttr idrow3gt lttdgtltbutton idbutton7 typebutton onclickactionPerformedthis.idltbuttongtlttdgt lttdgtltbutton idbutton8 typebutton onclickactionPerformedthis.idltbuttongtlttdgt lttdgtltbutton idbutton9 typebutton onclickactionPerformedthis.idltbuttongtlttdgt lttrgt  lttablegt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt    function actionPerformedparamID       document.getElementByIdparamID.value  X    ltscriptgt codepre

Negative 4446 pI am currently working on a project that does a lot of encryption using the attrencryptor gem a hrefhttpsrubygems.orggemsattrencryptor relnofollowhttpsrubygems.orggemsattrencryptorap  pattrencryptor uses the OpenSSL module a hrefhttpwww.rubydoc.orgstdlib1.9.3libdocopensslrdocOpenSSL.html relnofollowhttpwww.rubydoc.orgstdlib1.9.3libdocopensslrdocOpenSSL.htmla.

Negative 4446 pI have a design question. I have an applets call it app A gathering statistics from a system, by regularly polling each component in the system. I have a second appapp B which is supposed to make some decisions and enforce them into the same system, that app B is gathering statistics from. For the decision process, app B needs some info from the statistics gathered by app A.  So, at certain moments in timethis would be 10100s times per second app B makes a request to app A to get some infoi.e. some up to date statistics about the system. Whats the best solution to implement this exchange of info from app A to app B I was thinking of 2 solutions1 an RPCstyle solution, using a message queue RabbitMQ 2 a databasebased solution, have a table where app A publishes the most up to date info and app B reads it whenever needed. Please provide some insight on whether any of these two would make a good solution or not. Any other suggestions are welcome.  Thanksp

Negative 4446 pI want to serve some streaming data over HTTP. Additionally, Id like to compress the data to save bandwidth. I can trivially compress each streaming response separately, but in my case, the data stream is largely the same for every single client fanout, so it seems like a waste of CPU time to compress the same data for each connection. My plan is to compress each chunk of streaming data preemptively, so clients who connect at any time can start reading the next chunk this comes at the cost of reduced compression efficiency, but as long as the individual chunks of data are big enough, this should be fine.p  pCompliant HTTP clients are apparently supposed to be able to accept multiple gzipped files in a codeContentEncoding gzipcode response, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16740034httphowtosendmultipleprecachedgzippedchunksbut the answers to this question indicate web browsers do nota.

Negative 4446 pI have a content source which contains documents which i want to index using solr. So i installed solr amp index source which gives me indexes stored in solr. All is good.p  pNow my source has document addition say each day its getting 100 more documents i.e. if today is 1000 then tomorrow it would be 1100. Now i want to ensure that solr only indexes those documents which are either added as new or updated say only 100 documents in this case which i also call as delta indexing.p  pWhat i observed is that solr goes to indexing by scanning each document amp store its index. So in case of delta indexing, how solr would behavep  pWill solr index only 100 new documents or solr will scan all 1100 documents but will index only new 100 documents or will solr scan amp index all 1100 documents againp  pIdea here is to optimize the resource utilization as my source is engaged with heavy traffic from users using it so i am trying to minimize any impact of indexing on it.p  pRegards.p

Negative 4446 pI have a requirement from our UI guy that he would like all UILabels on the right of a table cell to line up with each other.

I am wondering if there is a way to maybe have a detail disclosure on all cells but not show itp  pAny ideasp

Negative 4446 pIn The D Programming Language by Andrei Alexandrescu,p  ptheres an example where a delegate is taken as a template parameterp  precodeT[] findalias pred, TT[] input   ifistypeofpredinput[0]  bool    for input.length gt 0 input  input[1 .. ]      if predinput[0] break      return input   unittest    int[] a  [1,2,3,4,5,3,4]   int z  2   auto b  finddelegatex  return x lt z a   asssertb  a[4..]  codepre  pAlexandrescu explains that this works because a delegate is actually a fat pointer consisting of two parts the function pointer and the pointer to its stack frame which is why z is accessible inside its body.  Except that find takes pred as a TEMPLATE parameter, not as an argument.  And template arguments can only be compiletime constants.p  pIm sure the address of the anonymous delegate in our unit test is indeed a compiletime constant, but the address of its stackframe certainly shouldnt be, so how can the delegate be taken as a template parameterp  pWhats really going on herep

Negative 4446 pIm writing a jQuery interface to use a couple of OData services created in SAP.

This didnt work either. The error that kept coming back was 401, so I assumed it was a cross domain issue.p  pThe last thing I stumbled upon was codeJSONPcode. The response is coming back with an OK status code, and once again if I view the body content I see my json string as I would expect it. The only problem is my browser says there is a syntax error in the response text. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8MtQn.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comvcPfy.png altenter image description herep  pAll of my search results have brought up issues regarding cross domain requests, and errors resulting therein. Maybe it is the issue, but because Im getting the results back that I would expect in the responses, Id have to assume that connectivity is no problem. p  ptldr ajax crossdomain requests are successful but dont trigger callback functions and jsonp gives me a syntax error. Im not sure where to keep looking. p

I get its value from a query string. But I still dont understand whats going on.p  pstrongEDIT2strong Anyway, I dont know how to resolve this problem, so Ive modified my code. Ive concatenated the users ID to a button name attribute. For example, nameaddfriend2, or namecancelrequest2. Before AJAX request, I split that string, and then send the button name and the ID separately. In serverside, I process the request, with the given ID and my own ID which remained in the session variable, and then return the users ID, and in AJAX callback, I concatenate it back to a new button name. Everything works fine now, but Im still confused with that session problem. p

Negative 4446 pI have interesting question regarding an application making use of AngularJS and D3. Essentially, I have an ngrepeat which repeats based on the contents of an array. In this array are objects which contain a REST url they will periodically reach out to and pull data from. Once they get this data, a graph is drawn using D3 one graph for each object in the array.p  pThe issue I am having is dynamically adding an object to this array via user input, and having the drawing work correctly. It appears that the d3 code jumps the gun and starts trying to select SVG elements that havent been rendered yet as Angular is still finishing adding stuff to the DOM via ngrepeat.p  pI have tried using timeout, and also created a custom directive similar to this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13471129angularjsngrepeatfinisheventAngularJS ngrepeat finish eventa.p  pIt works well, but only seems to fire the event the first time that the ngrepeat is run, not when I add another object to the array. Any comments on the best way to handle this situation If I could fire the event based on last everytime a new object is addedremoved and then iterate through the array and invoke the drawing function, that seems like it would work.p  pCheersp  pEdit The D3 code currently is similar to this a hrefhttpbl.ocks.orgmbostock1346410 relnofollowhttpbl.ocks.orgmbostock1346410a which is just a simple donut chart update, with the caveat that the redraw is triggered by a REST call. In the future however there may be more complicated graphs and such which is why I was hoping to use D3.p  pEdit 2 I have moved all my D3 code into a custom directive and after a lot of messing around it seems to work almost as it should. By not isolating the scope, the custom element has the same scope as the ngrepeat and can access the object and its properties, as well as the relevant DOM elements currently I am creating a DIV with an ID that is unique to each object.p  pThe problem now comes when using d3.select...when I try and select the DIV where I want to place the drawing, it will not allow me to select by ID, as it returns null..what is very strange about this is if I selectAlldiv, it can find the div Im looking for, but wont let me select just that one.p  pHere is a JsFiddle showing what I mean...check the console and see the first test returns the div obj1, but the second select returns null.p  pIf I could get this working and then append my SVG canvas and drawing within that div, I think it would workp  pRelevant selectsp  precode    var test  d3.selectAlldiv        console.logtest        var chart  d3.selectobj obj.id        console.logchart codepre  pHTML that should create the divsp  precode    ltdiv ngrepeatobject in myDatagt         ltdiv idobjobject.idgt             Hi             ltbarschartgtltbarschartgt        ltdivgt    ltdivgt  codepre  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netSleepyProgrammereN6p73 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netSleepyProgrammereN6p73ap

Negative 4446 pIm really new to R and have been banging my head over this problem for two nights of browsing SO and other R resources... I have a data set where I have two matrices, one for stock market observations stock returns and one for weights fraction of index market cap. In both cases columns are data for that stock ticker and rows  are data for that month.p  pI wish to use density to compare the rows monthly returns using Kullback Leibler divergence in a second step. My problem is that I cannot figure out a syntax to shift the weight row w[i,] used since I have been using apply  lapply, this might be the problem and then store the density output matrices neatly in a list. My results simply end up being the first weight row rather than the whole.p  pI also tried usingp  precodemylist lt list for x in 1n mylist lt densityR[x,]], 1, weights  W[x,] codepre  pwhich for some reason didnt output the probability  yvalue output of density ...p  pI would much appreciate any helpp

Negative 4446 pI have a really tricky bug in my macro project. p  pAt one point in the project I take a large dynamic range and convert it into a filterable table. I need to run several passes on this table, which each require a removal of duplicates in a different column. For this reason, Im using multiple copies of the sheet. p  pNow here lies the problemp  pThe table in the master sheet lets say table1 is being copied over perfectly Except that it is being named table12 some of the time, and depending how many times the user runs the script, it will create tables named table13 . . . 14 . . . 15 etc. p  pObviously I am using filters on the table which require the table to be named exactly under listobjects, and as such I get a failure if the script is run more than once in the workbook.p  pI am really stumped for workarounds, and have found that hiding the duplicate rows in the master sheet, rather than creating copies and deleting them, to cause more issues than it solves. p  pDoes anyone know of a more elegant solution to the problem, or any recommendations on how to do the hiding of duplicate rows more efficiently Thanks in advance if you dop

One is the connection and the other is the endpoint with IN direction.p  pThe attention is on the line codei  USBcon.bulkTransferUSBendIn, buffer, 2, 1code Ive tried different variations of the parameters for length and timeout and they all give out the exact same result. codeUSBcon.bulkTransferUSBendIn, buffer, 2, 3000code this is supposed to wait for 2 bytes and wait for them for about 3 seconds. If 2 bytes are received before these 3 seconds the function should return 2 and receive just those 2 bytes.p  pcodeUSBcon.bulkTransferUSBendIn, buffer, 100, 3000code this is supposed to wait for 100 bytes and wait for them for about 3 seconds and if after 3 seconds there are some bytes received less than 100 it should return this number.p  pcodeUSBcon.bulkTransferUSBendIn, buffer, 2, 1code this is supposed to wait for 2 bytes and wait for them for about 1 millisecond. If nothing gets in for 1ms it should return 0.p  pI even tried this codei  USBcon.bulkTransferUSBendIn, buffer, 10, 20code Guess negative timeouts are also acceptablep  pThose 4 examples all did the same exact thing. I receive some bytes in equal intervals with random length. The whole message I should receive is 24 bytes and I sometimes get it in 3 parts example  1 byte  8 bytes  15 bytes and sometimes I get them all at once. They are put in the buffer even when Ive stated I want to receive just 2 bytes. This shows errors in the length parameter. The timeout doesnt work either. Whatever I write as a timeout the function returns after some time cant tell how much regardless of the number of bytes received. Even negative times did the same. Even codeInteger.MAXVALUEcode with 240 as length did the same it receives 24 bytes every 3 seconds or so  it should have waited almost half a minute, it didnt.p  pThe only 2 times this function acted differently was when I entered 0 as length. 23 seconds after the service has started the tablet reboots itself. Putting a negative length did nothing though, no reboot and no data received.p  pSo.. what is going on  It is not that big of a problem for my service but I dont like when I cant trust system functions. Makes me wonder what else will not work properly.p

Negative 4446 pSo, Im trying to create an app which have a function like an alarm clock for Android phones, it will alert the user at their chosen time. When the alert screen show up, the user has an option to push a notification or snooze, and the app will push a notification and then close.p  pHowever, when I click the snooze or the notification button, the app did not close. Instead, the app stop the alarm sound and minimized just as when the user touch the home button. If I touch the recent app, I then can open the alert screen again.p  pEdit I know that therere some codes such as System.exit or killProcess, since those code are not recommended, I prefer avoid using them. The reason I ask is because I tested the real clock app that come with my phone 4.3, and the its alert screen will close after the I press the snooze or dismiss button. So there must be a way for me to do the same, right p  pstrongAnswerstrong  Okay, so as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma256725943623497Sagar Pilkhwala explained below, and after reading others related problems, I found out that theres no good method to close you app by codes, you have to leave that option to the users or OS. Unless you want to use System.exit or killProcess, but theyre bad ways to force your app to close.p  pSagar Pilkhwal also have a alternatively method to this problem, if you dont want your alert screen show up in recent app, you bring up another activity.p  pHowever, as for this case and Alarm Manager in general, open MainActivity will lead to nasty stuffs, since MainActivity is when we handle Alarm events. Then I found out another solution, if you dont want your alert screen show up in recent app, simply add p  precodeandroidexcludeFromRecentstrue codepre  pto your Alert.class Activity in the Manifest, or add codeIntent.FLAGACTIVITYEXCLUDEFROMRECENTScodeto the intent used to start Alert.class.p  pThis will lead to other problem, as when the user press the Home button, the alarm wont turn off, and the user cant open recent app to access the alert screen hell has to open the app to do so. I  fix this problem by try to detect the home button pressed event. Detail answer are below.p

So I have then checked the output of tracemc and it wasp  precode[object MovieClip] codepre  pHowever this piece of code actually lets the MovieClip object move to the topleft corner.p  precodeTweenLite.fromDus, 1,  y Dus.height ,easeCubic.easeOut,alpha0, onCompletemoveToTopLeftCorner  public function moveToTopLeftCornervoid           TweenLite.toDus, .8, x 30, y 40, onCompletesetObjectSmaller2           codepre  pMy question is why doesnt the moveToTopLeftCorner2mcMovieClip method move a MovieClip object to the topleft corner While the moveToTopLeftCorner method does move a MovieClip object to the topleft corner. I have also recorded myself to show you guys the output and the display of the MovieClip object.

Negative 4446 pI have a Geniatech ATV1220 android set top box running android 4.2.2 and am using an arduino with motion sensor connected to it to modify content on a website when someone is in front of the sensor via NodeJS. p  pThis works great, but what I would like to do is to manipulte the complete system viewport of the android system. For example if someone steps in front of the sensor, the whole system should be displayed in a reduced size like 14 original at the bottom right side of the screen while the other area should just display black or basically nothing.p  pIt is really hard to find something because of the pretty common keywords like display, viewport, size and so on.

Negative 4446 pIm working on a school project, my project is a Cypher and Decypher program that works with Caesar Algorithm.p  pMy program has to have the following characteristicsp  ul liThe program must give the user the option to initiate again. Done.  li liIf the user inputs something wrong, the program must ask the user to imput again. Done with a bug.  li liThe user can only input letters and  por spaces. I only need to add the space thing.   li liThe letter must be moved 5 places ie. A  F Done.  li liThe program must consider capital letters. Done.  li liEach time you input a letter the screen must clear. Done.  li liAt the end of the program you must be able to see the encrypted or decrypted text. Needs to finish.  li ul  pWhat I need to know is how to make the program show me the encrypted text, counting all the inputs I have made so far while the program has been running.p  pAnd an extra thing is how can I input a whole text sentence and apply the Caesar Encryption, obviously Id have to change almost all my code but Id like how to do it. p  pThis is the code I have so far, sorry if the sentences are in Spanish but I am living in Mexico for the moment and my classes are in Spanish. If you need me to translate the text I can gladly do it for you.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt include ltstdlib.hgt include lttime.hgt  using namespace std  int mainint, char       Variables.     char

Negative 4446 pI have an inner and outer loop in my VBA code. I would think that the execution time in total could be estimated as outer loop count  inner loop count, but it doesnt seem to be the case as performing 10  108 operations takes about 5 seconds, but performing 108  10 operations takes about 24 seconds.

Negative 4446 pIm new to unity, and Im trying to make a simple tunnel runner like game to ease into the engine. Ive created a spline, and I now need to wrap the spline with tunnel.

I cant find the solution anywhere. Can I do this, and if so, howp  pThank Youp

Negative 4446 pHow do you deal with components shared accros over the app Service Locator andor DIp  pEvery application has common components that we met over and over again. These might be DatabaseManager, CacheManager, UserManager, ReportingManager, SettingsManager, BackendAPIManager, CrashManager, .... p  pTypically these components are classes in my case because I like encapsulating related things into components that provide nice and easy acces to other parts of code. As a general rule of thumb, we can encapsulate the code into one class as long as the class operates on single reponsibility principle and its not too big. p  pSome of these classes are like wrappers for 3rd party libraries  ReportingManager, CrashManager Google Analytics, Crashlytics, ..., some encapsulate web services calling part  BackendAPIManager for AFNetworking. Some also are like wrappers  DatabaseManager Core data, FMDB, CacheManager serializing to file SettingsManager NSUserDefault. p  pMost of the mentioned componentsclasses doesnt store state or anything else  their implementations just encapsulate behavioural code. But sometines, some classes encapsulate both behavioural and state code, for example UserManager interacts with BackendAPIManager, stores retrieved user, stores login state and has nice API methods login, logout, register, resetPassword, isLoggedIn.p  pNow, theres a high temptation to create singletons for that, but we all know singletons are bad for unit testing. So, one of the possible ways is to create sort of singleton Registry also known as Service Locator design pattern with methods registerObject, getObject and create and register all these objects during app launch and then always use viap  precode[[Registry shared] getObjectprotocolUserManagerProtocol] codepre  pTherefore, in your tests you unregister not needed managers and register mocks via Registry registerObject. Service Locator pattern is described by a hrefhttpmartinfowler.comarticlesinjection.html relnofollowMartin Fowlera and according to him its an alternative to Dependency injection. However, another remarkable author a hrefhttpblog.ploeh.dk20100203ServiceLocatorisanAntiPattern relnofollowMark Seemanna from .NET world claims Service Locator is an antipattern mostly because you need not forget to register new shared objects, need to know how application works because Registry hides all the dependecies and devs dont like resetting and registering these shared objects for unit tests.p  pWhile both Service Locator and Dependency injection helps to separate dependent objects from the usage code, still Dependency Injection is more popular in various discussions and forums and looks like gained more popularity. Though I used Service Locator previously for shared components and sometimes DI for injecting nonshared objects into code, Im interested for an alternative how I could deal with shared objects. Some migh suggest doesnt care about singleness of the objects, just create new instances and inject everytime using dependency injection, however its  bad approach to duplicate these objects and sometimes will lead to issues if your object stores state. p  pIm using and extending from BaseModel, BaseViewController, so its very easy for me to add related manager properties on those two classes for dependency injection. Iv used property with default value type of DI implementation a hrefhttpwww.objc.ioissue15dependencyinjection.html relnofollowApproach described hereap  precode UserManager userManager      Lazy instantiation of the default value in case we didnt injected dependency explicitly   if userManager       userManager  [[Registry shared] getObjectprotocolUserManager]       return userManager  codepre  pThis way I dont need explicitly pass dependecies to subclasses of BaseModel and BaseViewController over and over again. The default value will be taken from Registry. All the shared objects will be registered on app launch ServiceLocatorp  precode[[Registry shared] register[UserManager new]] [[Registry shared] register[SettingsManager new]] [[Registry shared] register[BackendAPIManager new]] ... codepre  pAnd then use self.userManager, self.settingsManager, self.backendAPIManager inside other code for accesing them. p  pSo the proposed solution uses Dependency Injection  Service Locator, and its very easy to write unit tests and explicitly inject and set dependecies via properties that we exposed and added to BaseModel and BaseViewController  userManager,  settingssManager,  backendAPIManager.p  pWhat do you think abot this approach Im just trying to avoid using DI framework as I always try to keep my code clean and easy to debugp

Negative 4446 pIm simply trying to reset a form using the angular functions strongsetPristinestrong amp strongsetUntouchedstrong several forms are created with ngrepeat.br  I assign the form name dynamically by using the syntax strong someName strong the name is build on the server side and is passed as json string.br  The name of the form is correctly assigned in the markup and validations are working as expected. The problem arrises when I pass that name as a parameter in the ngclickresetsomeName function.br  When debugging the name comes as a string and not as the form object which causes the error. I did a quick test by hardcoding the name and pass that same name and it works fine.br My assumption is, the name coming from json is a string and the type is forwarded to the function as is, instead of the object.br  So the question is is there a way to convert that name so it is interpretated correctly by the controller. Or maybe there is something else Im missing...p  pHere is the markup  notice the name of the form uses  resto.contactForm  p  precodeltform novalidate name resto.contactForm  ngsubmitsubmitrestoContact, resto.contactForm.valid classskyformgt   ltdiv classformgroupgt     ltlabel classcheckbox statesuccessgt       ltinput typecheckbox ngmodelrestoContact.sameAsUser namesameAsUser idsameAsUser valuetrue ngclickcontactAutoFillgtltigtltigtContact name is same as current user.       ltinput typehidden namesameAsUser valuefalse gt     ltlabelgt   ltdivgt   ltdiv classformgroupgt      ltlabel classcontrollabel forcontactNamegtContact Nameltlabelgt      ltinput typetext ngmodelrestoContact.contactName namecontactName idcontactName placeholderJohn, Doe classformcontrol required gt        ltdiv ngshow resto.contactForm .contactName.error.required ampamp  resto.contactForm .contactName.pristine classnote noteerrorgtPlease enter a name or check the box Same as current user.ltdivgt    ltdivgt    ltdiv classformgroupgt      ltlabel classcontrollabel forcontactPhoneNumbergtContact Phone Numberltlabelgt      ltinput typetext ngmodelrestoContact.contactPhoneNumber namecontactPhoneNumber idcontactPhoneNumber placeholder1 5551234567 classformcontrol required ngpatternphoneNumberPattern gt        ltdiv ngshow resto.contactForm .contactPhoneNumber.error.required   resto.contactForm .contactPhoneNumber.error.pattern ampamp  resto.contactForm .contactPhoneNumber.pristine classnote noteerrorgtPlease enter a valid phone number.ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classmarginleftM19gt       ltbutton classbtn btnprimarygtSave Changes ltbuttongt       ltbutton classbtn btndefault ngclickresetresto.contactFormgtCancel ltbuttongt     ltdivgt ltformgt codepre  pHere is the reset function in the controller form comes as contactForm1 which is the correct name but is a string and not the objectp  precodescope.reset  function form                      if form              form.setPristine             form.setUntouched                  scope.user  angular.copyscope.master      codepre  pI have not implemented th submit method but Im sure I will be running into the same issue.

Point of concern is the code is running fine on localhost that is when my system is both server and client when the host address is 127.0.0.1 but when I run server on my system and client on some other system connected to the same LAN as mine ie the host client window says connection refused even when The SERVER is RUNNING and Ive removed ALL FIREWALL SETTING. Ill really thankful to the one who could help. I am really not able to deal with this. Ive tried every possible solution.p  pBy the way, for internet we use proxy server. does that have anything to do with the lan connectionp

Negative 4446 pI am wondering if there is a way to batch the actual dom writing when the contents of a directive is written to the DOM.p  pThe use case is a large DOM where I want to optimize by updating the DOM in large batches rather than many small updates.

The child directives use isolate scope and the template is referencing the scope object throughout the template. The template is a large block of html referenced via a templateUrl in the child directive.p  pI cant skip the child directives by simply inlining the template since the structure needs to be repeated and data bound.p

Negative 4446 pI need to call 2 apis in a view controller to fetch some data from server, I want them to start at the same time, but next step will only be triggered if both of them are returneddoesnt matter its a success or failure.

Set 2 Bool indicator variables, create a check function, if both of these indicators are true, do next. In both Apis result handler, set corresponding indicator variable, then call check function to decide if its good to gop  pFirst one is not sufficient enough, and I cant say the second one is a elegant solution.

Negative 4446 pIve been tasked with optimizing a mature 2D Unity project.  The biggest performance hiccup occurs when the app plays particle animations, so Im trying to prerender the graphics containing these animations into a spritesheet using a RenderTexture at runtime the storage restrictions prevent me from doing this as a preprocessing step.  Ive added a camera to the project and in the constructor for the GameObjects in question, I supply the camera with a RenderTexture, position it a fixed distance from the object, and then call the objects animator.Update1.0f30 while moving the camera viewport across the RenderTexture, thereby rendering the frames.  It works, mostly.  The problem is the particle systems dont render, and the animation doesnt seem to advance properly, though it does advance.  Would anyone know why the particle systems are not rendering, and why the animation is not advancing properly  Ive copied my code below.  Thank you.p  precode        if this.animatedGameObject  null              GameObject nobj  GameObjectRoutineRunner.Instantiate this.animatedGameObject, new Vector3100, 100, 10, new Quaternion             Animator animator  nobj.GetComponentltAnimatorgt             if animator  null                  RenderTexture active  RenderTexture.active                 RenderTexture rt  RenderTexture.GetTemporary 2048, 2048, 16                 Camera c  GameObject.Find ParticleCamera.camera                 int x, y                 float frameStep                  rt.DiscardContents                 c.enabled  true                 c.targetTexture  rt                 if nobj.renderer  null                      Bounds b  nobj.renderer.bounds                     c.transform.Translatenobj.transform.position  new Vector3b.size.x0.5f, b.size.y0.5f, 10.0f, Space.World                  else                      Debug.Lognobj.renderer is null.n                                  if animator.animation  null ampamp animator.animation.clip  null                      Debug.Log Animation clip found, using length of   animator.animation.clip.length   seconds.n                     frameStep  animator.animation.clip.length64.0f                  else                       I always seem to hit this else case, so render the                      animation at 30fps.

Negative 4446 pMy application built in MVC5EF6 needs to use a single database with two schemasp  ul listrongidentitystrong To store all the AspNet identity tables for users and roles.li listrongapplicationstrong To store all my general application tables.li ul  pI want to use a separate DbContext for each schema, with the codeidentitycode one being created with the codeMicrosoft.AspNet.Identity.EntityFramework.IdentityDbContextltApplicationUsergtcode helper class, and the main codeapplicationcode one being created in code with code first. The reason for having two DbContexts like this is so I can put the main application context in a separate assembly and use it in other related projects without having to reference Asp.Net.p  pHowever, I want to reference a table in the codeapplicationcode schemacontext with a foreign key that I want to add to the codeidentity.AspNetUserscode table, along with some other extra fields. I then want to create a codeUserscode entity in the main context that maps to the codeidentity.AspNetUserscode table.p  pFor example, I want an codeapplication.Tenantscode table of which codeidentity.AspNetUserscode has a foreign key to, so that I can have many users belonging to a single tenant.p  pAll this is fine I think and will work with no problems, except when it comes to creating the database, and possibly any migrations that affect that table, as Ill have two DbContexts trying to create the same table.p  pCan I mark a table within codeOnModelCreatingcode as do not create, and if so how do I add the foreign key constraint If not then how do I handle this I dont think what Im trying to do is unreasonable. I just want to avoid having two Users tables linked with an implied foreign key i.e. with no actual foreign key constraint.p

If I will echo back something 1 if there is an already exist record with that ssn.  This is where I get stuck at.  What would be the rule.  It cannot be requiredssn because it is not required but it must be something that says this is not valid because I have returned this 1 from the ajax function.  I hope this makes sense.  Any ideasp

Negative 4446 pIm an medieval historian and trying to create a neo4j Database with Persons from the 13th century and their relationships changing over time. The relations are created from informations from charters and so they have a starting date with the date of the charter and they end three years after the date of the charter which is a personal chosen value from me and can be changed for research purposes. But if there is a charter in between these 3 years i want to update the type of the relationship. At the moment I have no idea how to code overtimechanging relationships in neo4j. Im importing the nodes and edges from csvTables and at the moment i have about 7000 relationships. Any ideas out there p
Negative 4446 pIm using rails 4 to create an application. And in a form I use dateselect helper to help user select their birth date. I can change the months name to Thai which is no problem. But I was wondering if there is a way to display years according to Thai calendar which would be 543 years more than Christian calendar. For example if this year is 2015 Thai year would be 2015543  2558 , if the year is 1991 that Thai year would be 19915432534. Please I really want to know if it can be done . Thanks.p
Negative 4446 pI have created a simple OSX Command Line App project with Xcode 6.3, called strongFoostrong, and set the location of strongFoostrong to strongDesktopstrong. Building and running the project is fine. To be clear, the project path is strongDesktopFooFoo.xcodeprojstrong.p  pIf I move the projects containing directory strongDesktopFoostrong to, say strongDesktoptmpFoostrong, open strongDesktoptmpFooFoo.xcodeprojstrong, and then build the project, I see that Xcode creates strongDesktopFoobuildstrong and so on. It seems that Xcode is still using the old build path rather than the build directory that is relative to the project strongDesktoptmpFoobuildstrong.p  pWhy is this I am using a typical installation of Xcode and have not modified any configuration of Xcode nor the project or its build settings. Xcode 5 definitely did not behave this way.p  pYes, the project has been cleaned.p

Negative 4446 pIm not a mongodb expert, so Im a little unsure about server setup now.p  pI have a single instance running mongo3.0.2 with wiredtiger, accepting both read and write ops.

Im thinking about splitting write and read to avoid locks on my collections server continues to write logs while im reading, newly written logs may match my queries, but i can skip them, because i dont need 100 accuracy.p  pIn other words, i want to make a setup with a secondary for read, where replication is not performing continuously, but starts in a configured time or better is triggered before all read operations are started.p  pIm making all my processing from node.js so one option i see here is to export data created in some period like [yesterday, today] and import it to read instance by myself and make calculations after import is done. I was looking on replica set and masterslave replication as possible setups but i didnt get how to config it to achieve the described scenario.  So maybe i wrong and miss something here Are there any other options to achieve thisp

That took less than a second to run in SSMS, but the profiler showed 10 a second gap between the start and end of the batch.

Negative 4446 pI am creating a Seaborn heatmap with a given pandas dataframe that has numbers and nans. Something like sop  precode1 2 nan 4 nan nan nan nan nan codepre  pI need the heatmap to be annoted and I also need to maskgrey out all the nans. I found the mask function and can use it like sop  precodemask  df.isnull codepre  pThen, I can create the heatmap like sop  precodesns.heatmapdf, mask  mask, annot  True, fmt  g, cmap  Blues codepre  pThe problem is, with the mask, it seems the nans are transformed into strings while the numbers stay as floats. I get the following exceptionp  blockquote   pValueError Unknown format code g for object of type strp blockquote  pWith something like this happening partial plot before it throws the exceptionp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqOtem.png altenter image description herep  pAs you can tell, the first cell formatted is fine as its a float, but then, when it gets to the nan that is masked, it seems it is not a string and cannot be formatted.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions on how to annotate only the unmasked datap  pThanksp

Negative 4446 pIm writing a game server in Java, and Im using Netty 3.6.2. The game servers should accept no HTTP requests, as they simply handle game client data which is purely bytes over TCP.

Negative 4446 pIve been trying to solve this problem for few days now and googleSO has not helped me.p  pWhen viewing a tableview from an iPAD, it requires 2 finger pan gesture to scroll the tableview only if the user interaction of the cells is enabledp  pA friend of mine suggested that I probably have 2 nested gesture recognizers which could possibly result to this behaviour. However, this behaviour is not present on iPhone.p  pI have 2 different tableviews on my application and only the one, which has user interaction enabled behaves like this. I started debugging and I found something interesting.p  pHere is a screenshot of the viewtree of the tableview that doesnt require 2 fingers to pan. The broken tableview has a similar viewtree. It seems that the tree is infinite and I wonder why this doesnt result to crash. Could someone confirm, this is the expected behaviourp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgt58s.png altTableView GestureRecognizer structurep  pDid anyone stumble across the forced 2 finger pan gesture on tableviews on iPAD. This doesnt seem to be the default behaviour on iOS native applications.p  pThank you very much for all the answersp  pEdit 1p  pThe 2 finger panning is forced only on dynamic prototype cells, but not in a tableView with static cells. Ive been checking my tableViews and the cell constructors, but Im not doing anything gesture related there.p  pself.tableView.panGestureRecognizer.minimumNumberOfTouches  1p

Negative 4446 pstrongThis question is now mootstrongp  pIve recomputed statistics on the table, added new indices, and reanalyzed the existing indices. This has completely changed my results and invalidates most of my findings below.

Part of the application Im working on has a random video chat. The room is created by a user and while theyre waiting for someone to join they close their browser tabwindow and then the room is not closed out correctly and still open for another user to join.p  pIve seen many examples using beforeunload, but they just arent working for me with Ember. Maybe Im missing a more ember way of doing things, or maybe I need to rely on a heartbeat approachp  pWhat Ive been trying to do is use the window beforeunload event, but I havent been having any luck.

Negative 4446 pMethods have documentation in my header file but CLion does not show the method documentation when I press F1 neither when doing autocomplete. p  pThe header file Im using isp  precodeinclude ltGLFWglfw3.hgt codepre  pAnd an example declaration from itp  precode brief Terminates the GLFW library.      This function destroys all remaining windows and cursors, restores any    modified gamma ramps and frees any other allocated resources.  Once this    function is called, you must again call ref glfwInit successfully before    you will be able to use most GLFW functions.      If GLFW has been successfully initialized, this function should be called    before the application exits.  If initialization fails, there is no need to    call this function, as it is called by ref glfwInit before it returns    failure.      remarks This function may be called before ref glfwInit.      warning No windows context may be current on another thread when this    function is called.      par Reentrancy    This function may not be called from a callback.      par Thread Safety    This function may only be called from the main thread.      sa ref introinit    sa glfwInit      since Added in GLFW 1.0.      ingroup init   GLFWAPI void glfwTerminatevoid codepre  pWhy is CLion not showing the documentation during autocomplete andor what do I have to do to make it workp  pI use codeCLion 1.1code.p

Negative 4446 pI have integrated siteminder with my spring application which runs on Tomcat and the front end is developed on AngularJS. The problem is that after 20 minutes of logging in I am getting error in webagent.log saying strongUnable to process SMSESSION cookiestrong.p  pInteresting point is that it is stronghappening only for GET requestsstrong and apache is strongthrowing 302 for these requestsstrong, trying to redirect to SSO login page. However, for POST requests, I am getting 200 with proper response. When user is redirected to SSO login page, SSO again redirects to the application without asking to enter login credentials again. And again application works fine for next 20 minutes until GET requests starts failing again.p  pDoes anyone know rootcausesolution of this issuep  pThanks.p

Negative 4446 pIn an ssrs 2012, there is an problem when the report is exported to excel when running on a ssrs 2012 report server. When the report is generated, selected cells are highlighted. When the report is exported to a PDF file, the correct selected cells are highlighted with a background color. p  pHowever when the report is exported to excel on the report server, all cells are highlited from the first point of where the individual cells are highlighted to the end of the data. For example, if row  5 has a cell highligted in column D then all rows from row 5 to the end have in column D are incorrectly highlighted.p  pWhen I run the rdl on my workstation, there are no export problems. The report server exports excel files to an .xls file and my workstation also exports the excel file to an .xls file also. However I do have office 2013 on my workstation. p  pNote The code that is causing this highlight the background color for a cell is the followingp  pIIFFieldsIndicatorCount12.Value  0, LightSteelBlue , nothing. This is the code in the background property of the applicable cell.p  pThus would you tell me andor point me to a url that will tell me how to solve this problemp

Negative 4446 pI am trying to create a sidebaradd on for Google sheet that would let the user login into adwords account, and pull the data for different date ranges. I know I can do the same via adwords.google.com, however I want to see specifically formatted, and combinedad groups, size, etc data in the sheet.  So here is what I thought ofp  pCreate a script that loads a sidebar, have the sidebar authenticate the adwords. Store the necessary information on an endpoint. When the request is made from sheet, the end point gets it sends a request to adwords API, gets the data and processes it. Finally, it returns the data to sheet in predesired format and the sheet just displays the data. p  pI havent still figured out the details, like what sort of call I need to make from sheet to end point, or what information needs to be stored on endpoint regarding the user so that the endpoint can make API calls, and most  important one how does the endpoint know what user is sending the requestI would assume that the authorization of the sheet would give some sort of code or email that I can store on endpoint, and subsequent calls for requests will have this unique piece of information.  I would like your opinion on this logic, and if any one of you are able to help me fill in the gaps as to what information i need to store at what stage, I would greatly appreciate it. p  pI am thinking of having Django running on the endpoint. p  pThanksp

Negative 4446 pI am running a piece of python code on a raspberry pi.br The function of the code is that GPIO 5 is set as a pull up resistor with a momentary switch attached. When the switch is pressed it grounds the pull up resistor. I am attempting to use the button push to trigger a callback.br The callback works like thisbr If the button is pressed and detected as still pressed it defines a variable called t1 as the current time.br If the button is detected as no longer pressed it defines a variable called t2 then subtracts t1 from t2 to find the time difference amount of time button was held down for. It then converts that value to an integer defined as variable deltaseconds.  Then it takes action based on the length the button was held for. If more than 7 seconds, reboot the raspberry pi, if more than 1 second but less than 7 it toggles output GPIO12 between high and low.  p  pThe issue I am experiencing is like thisbr The code runsbr When the button is pressed I see the print of Button 5 pressedbr When the button is released I see the print Button 5 releasedbr Then an error is display as codeUnboundLocalError local variable t1 referenced before assignmentcodebr The error is in reference to line 21 codedelta  t2t1code  p  pThe full code looks like this  p  precodeimport os import RPi.GPIO as GPIO import webiopi import time import datetime from datetime import datetime GPIO.setwarningsTrue GPIO.setmodeGPIO.BCM BUTTON5  5 GPIO.setup5, GPIO.IN, pullupdownGPIO.PUDUP GPIO.setup12,GPIO.OUT GPIO.output12,1 Just to visually distinguish between setup steps and main program def pressedBUTTON5     if GPIO.input5  False         t1  datetime.now         print Button 5 pressed     elif GPIO.input5  True         print Button 5 released         t2  datetime.now         delta  t2t1         deltaseconds  delta.totalseconds         if deltaseconds gt 7   pressed for gt 7 seconds             print Restarting System             subprocess.call[shutdown r now System halted by GPIO action amp], shellTrue         elif deltaseconds gt 1   press for gt 1 lt 7 seconds             print Toggling GPIO 12             GPIO.output12, not GPIO.input12 GPIO.addeventdetectBUTTON5, GPIO.BOTH, bouncetime200 GPIO.addeventcallbackBUTTON5, pressed try     while True         time.sleep1 except KeyboardInterrupt     GPIO.cleanup        clean up GPIO on CTRLC exit codepre
