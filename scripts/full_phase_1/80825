Positive 80825 pVisual Studio 2012, C project.p  pMy project has a dependency to external library includes its headers.

Each developer may keep the library sources in different locations Dev1 will keep it on Clibs, Dev2 somewhere else.p  pIs there a way to keep the dependency in the project, but yet to avoid committing VC Project file with my own path to remote repository I was thinking about adding to Include directories environment variable that each developer would have to set properly on their machines, but maybe there are some better solutionsp
Positive 80825 pFor all Visual Studio ASP.Net MVC developers  Im sure youve faced this problem beforep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comMcGHr.pngimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comMcGHr.png altenter image description hereap  pIn each one of my controllers, there is usually an Index, Create, Edit and Detail views.

Positive 80825 pThe company Ive been working on will develop a new project and in this project, strongWindows Workflow Foundation 4.5strongwe cant change it will be used for process flow system which will be consumed by a web UI. Our main use case is order payment which has multiple steps in UI and in every state transition, UI will notify workflow instance that if provided values are valid.

Positive 80825 pUsing VS2012, I observed that if there is an lambda expression and it contains a error, the compiler does not show the actual syntactical error. p  pTake this examplep  precodepublic class CustomBoostrapper  DefaultNancyBootstrapper      protected override void RequestStartupTinyIoCContainer container, IPipelines pipelines, NancyContext context              pipelines.BeforeRequest  ctx gt                      if11 the actual error that needs to be corrected             return new Response                codepre  pThe compiler will report two errors, usually p  precodeOperator  cannot be applied to operands of type some type and lambda expression Cannot convert lambda expression to type some type because it is not a delegate type codepre  pBut it doesnt even bother to report that there is a nonboolean expression in the if and when corrected, the errors about lambda expressions goes away. The worse thing is that it apparently shows for any kind of compiler error. If one is writing a complex function and make a goof somewhere, they are only left with two very generic errors and must hunt for the actual syntax error or something similar within the body. Is there a way to avoid this obfuscation p  pNote this example was noticed when using Nancy framework. I additionally observed that it was not just this particular function but also anywhere else I used a lambda function. At first I thought it was something to do with a compiler but as subsequent comments makes clear, it might not be something to do with the compiler or Visual Studio. p  pNote 2 I just discovered this only happens with anonymous function. If I define the function and then reference it from the lambda expression instead, the compiler correctly catches the errors within the function. p

Positive 80825 pI need to change the column delimiter character of the .csv exported file of the Concurrency Visualizer Thread View. Im using C, in Visual Studio 2012, on Windows 7 Ultimate.p  pThe problem is that the CSV file uses the comma code,code character, to separate the columns, and also in the numbers. This brings confusion to the statistics software, including Microsoft Excel. With this symbol you cannot tell if code2000,22code is a float number or two columns the first with the code2000code value, and the second with the code22code value. I tried to open these files with Microsoft Excel and SPSS v19, using comma , or space as columns delimiter, but I do not get the same table exported from the Concurrency Visualizer.p  pIm doing an investigation that requires measuring code block in milliseconds, that is why Im using the span of the Concurrency Visualizer. I need to statistically process the duration of all the spans, to be sure my code is getting the right results. That is why I am using the CSV export feature, in the Concurrency Visualizer Thread View.p  pThe semicolon character codecode could be a nice column delimiter, because it eliminates the ambiguity. p  pThe CSV file exported by the Concurrency Visualizer Thread View can be a great tool for software investigation, once we solve this.p

Positive 80825 pHi I need to move my source code from one my existing TFS server to a new TFS server that is a clone of my existing one. From what I remember I think both servers are 2012 and I am using Visual Studio 2013 for development.p  pThe clone already has my project on it, but it is an old version of the code. The existing server has the latest code but will be decommissioned soon.p  pWithout having admin access on either server how can I move my code from the existing server with the latest code to the new server with an old version of the code.p  pIs it possible to do this and maintain the project history including the last month of development, or will I only be able to keep the code  TFS is a managed service for me and I dont have the option to stay on the existing server.p  pI have only seen solutions where the new TFS server is clean. p
Positive 80825 pI am trying to figure out the functions for an application that you order donuts and coffee through.  There is no box to input quantities.

Negative 80825 pI want to call a function from within plugin, but the function is on the main page and not the plugins .js file.  p  pEDITp  pI have jQuery parsing a very large XML file and building, subsequently, a large list 1.1 MB HTML file when dynamic content is copied, pasted, then saved that has expandcollapse functionality through a plugin.  The overall performance on IE is super slow and doggy, assuming since the pageDOM is so big.p  pI am currently trying to save the collapsed content in the event.data when it is collapsed and remove it from the DOM, then bring it back when it is told to expand...  the issue that I am having is that when I bring the content back, obviously the click and hover events are gone.  Im trying to reassign them, currently doing so inside the plugin after the plugin expands the content.

Negative 80825 pI have several sites in different domains codeexample.comcode, codeexample.orgcode, codemail.example.comcode and codepassport.example.orgcode. All of the sites are having common lookandfeel and should share the same user base.p  pAnd in such extreme case I still want all the sites to emtransparentlyem as much as possible share user sessions with the following key propertiesp  ol lipstrongSingle signonstrong. When user signs on at codepassport.example.orgcode and visits any other site  he should be treated as logged in.p  pLogged in users get Hello, codeusernamecode greeting in site header and different navigation menu, listing services they have access to. If hes not signed in, instead of greeting theres a Sign on link, pointing to codepassport.example.orgsignoncode.p  pThe list of trusted domains is known, so this is fairly simple to implement either with OpenID or with some homebrewn lightweight protocol. When user first hits the site, Im redirecting him to special authentication endpoint at codepassport.example.orgcode, which then silently redirects him back, with identity information or not signed on anonymous identity included. For most browsers this is completely transparent. Obviously, Im using nonce values to fight redirection loops.pli lipstrongSingle signoffstrong. When user clicks sign off in the header of any site the next time he visits any site  he should be seen as not sign on.p  pOpenID was not designed for this. My current idea I already have a partiallyworking implementation is to send not user identity, but global session token and share global sessions table globalsessiontoken  user relation in DB.pli lipstrongRobots and cookielessusers supportstrong. Sites are having public areas, which should be accessible by useragents without any cookie support.p  pBecause of this, redirection Ive mentioned in 1 becomes a problem, because for every single page request, Ill end up throwing useragent to auth endpoint and back. Not only this will confuse robots, but it will pollute my session database with deadonbirth sessions very quickly. And I definitely dont want to display hey, you dont have cookies enabled, go away page, thatd be extremely rude and disappointing. While I require cookie support to login, I want users to freely read what the sites are for and so on  without any restrictions.p  pAnd I explicitly emdontem want to put session IDs in URLs except for some transparent crossdomain redirections Ive mentioned. I believe doing such is a security problem and just generally a Bad Thing.p  pAnd here Im almost out of ideas.pli ol  pOkay, I know this is hard, but Google actually does this somehow with codegoogle.comcode, codegoogle.codeemlotofgTLDsem, codegmail.comcode and so on, right So this should be possible.p  pId be grateful for either protocol description ideas thatd be the best or links to systems either code to read or just live sites to watch and learn upon already successfully implementing something like this.p  pstrongTo sum it upstrong Several domains without common root, shared user base, single signon, single signoff, no cookies required to browse anonymously.p  pAll of the sites are on the same network but rest on different servers and partially share the same PostgreSQL database resting in the different schemes of the same database. Most of sites are written with PythonDjango, but some of them are using PHP and Ruby on Rails. While Im thinking of something framework and languageagnostic, Im grateful for pointing to any implementations. Even if I wont be able to use them, if Ill get the idea how its done there maybe Ill be able to come up implementing something similar.p

Negative 80825 pI help moderate a forum online, and on this forum we restrict the size of signatures.

Furthermore, suppose that Im doing some calculation on the data and the result is small enough to fit in memory.  As a hypothetical example, suppose I need to calculate an md5sum of a 200GB file and I need to do so with guarantees about how much ram will be used.p  pIn summaryp  ul liNeeds to be constant spaceli liFast as possibleli liAssume very large filesli liResult fits in memoryli ul  h2Questionh2  pWhat are the fastest ways to readstream data from a file using constant spacep  h2Ideas Ive hadh2  pIf the file was small enough to fit in memory, then codemmapcode on POSIX systems would be very fast, unfortunately thats not the case here.  Is there any performance advantage to using codemmapcode with a small buffer size to buffer successive chunks of the file  Would the system call overhead of moving the codemmapcode buffer down the file dominate any advantages Or should I use a fixed buffer that I read into with codefreadcodep

Since neither of those namespaces are present in the actual response xml, exceptions are thrown. p  pI am wondering if there is any simple way to transform an xml document from one set of namespaces to another set using C, .NET, and the System.Xml namespace. Ive poked around with XmlNamespaceManager a bit, but it does not seem to fully support what I need...or at least, I have been unable to find any really useful examples, and am not fully sure how it works. I am trying to avoid having to write some heavyduty process to handle this manually myself, as I do not want to drastically impact the performance of our services when called by a Java AxisWSS4J client.p

Negative 80825 pI want to be able to ban users by IP. My idea is to keep a list of IPs as rows in an BannedIPs table the IP column would be an index.p  pTo check users IPs against the table, I will keep a session variable called SESSION[IP] for each session. If on any request, SESSION[IP] doesnt match SERVER[REMOTEADDR], I will update SESSION[IP] and check the BannedIPs table to see if the IP is banned. A flag will also be saved as a session variable specifying whether or not the user is bannedp  pHere are the things Im wonderingp  ol liDoes that sound like a good strategy with regards to speed and security would someone be able to get around the IP ban somehow, other than changing IPs, emedit or using a proxyemli liWhats the best way to structure a mysql query that checks to see if a row exists That is, whats the best way to query the db to see if a row with a certain IP exists to check if its bannedli liShould I save the IPs as integers or stringsli ol  pNote that...p  ul liI estimate there will be between 1,00010,000 banned IPs stored in the database.li liSERVER[REMOTEADDR] is the IP from which the current request was sent.li ul

Negative 80825 pI write software for an IT consulting company that supports a number of clients that will very soon be migrating from Windows XP to Windows 7.  One of the tools we use is Ultra VNC Single Click, which lets us connect to a client computer and share the users desktop.  Eventually, I wrote an application that sits on the users desktop and packages the single click .exe among other tools.  This is extremely useful for the techs, and since it requires both sides to initiate the connection we dont have to leave a service running on the users workstations that could potentially be exploited, and we can easily access computers without public IPs most of them.p  pHowever, with Windows 7 ampamp UAC, all is not well.  If UAC is active, starting Ultra VNC SC brings up a UAC prompt.  We will not be disabling UAC.  We will not be granting admin rights.  A UAC prompt is a deal ender.  p  pHas anyone else dealt with a similar problem  Is there a library or program I can use that will allow us to share the users desktops without forcing a UAC prompt  I have looked for a way to whitelist my own program, but with no luck.  Maybe a way to temporarily disable UAC entirely  I am working in .NET, so a .NET solution would be preferred, but I am willing to look elsewherep

Negative 80825 pI dont know from where should I start solving this problem. p  pIt seems that the Math department at UGA once again dropped the ball , and forgot the value of pi. You are to write a function called mypi which consumes a number that specifies the required accuracy and approximates the value of pi to that accuracy. You are going to the following algorithm based on geometric probability.p  pThink about a quarter circle inside of a unite square the quarter circle has area pi4. You pick a random point inside the square. if it is in the quarter circle, you get a hit and if not, you get a miss. The approximate area of the quarter circle will be giving by the number of hits divided by the number of points you chose.p  pYour function should repeat the process of counting hits and misses until at least 10,000 tries have been made, and successive estimates of pi are within the prescribed accuracy. it should return the estimated value of pi.p  pHINT 1 Use the function rand... in this problem.p  p2 Think about the probability that a random point ends up in the quarter circle.  You can simulate this probability by counting how many random points end up in the quarter circle.  This means you must geometrically define where the quarter circle is and have a script that can determine if the random point in the square is inside the boundaries of the quarter circle.   p

Negative 80825 pFrom reading the LibTIFF source code, it appears to me that the a hrefhttpwww.remotesensing.orglibtiffinternals.html relnofollowmain approacha to customizing LibTIFF is to define new Tags and to implement new Codecs. Also, since LibTIFF is opensource and has a liberal license, users who need to tweak it for various purposes can modify it directly.p  pHowever, there is a kind of customization which doesnt seem to fit into the two approaches to extension I want to install various kinds of event listeners callback functions so that I can detect various conditions that happen inside the existing codecs.p  pExample 1 I want to be able to replace the error  warning message handlers of LibTIFF so that it is threadsafe and sends the messages to a callback function set by the caller.p  pExample 2 Some TIFF images may be missing some tags, and LibTIFF tries to make them up by guessing their values. Sometimes some tags are obviously wrong and LibTIFF tries to correct them. However, I would like to have a callback function which is notified whenever LibTIFF changes the tags value, so that I can log this and generate a report about the images conformance to the standard.p  pExample 3 I need to concatenate several pages of a multipage TIFF together. The pages have the same dimensions and compression parameters. If I have access to the compressed data, then I can do this more efficiently by copying the compressed data verbatim into the strips of a new TIFF image.p  pWhat is the recommended way of adding callback functions  event listeners to LibTIFF, without complicating its architecturep

Negative 80825 pI have a little application that implements a DesignSurface as well as a propertyGrid. The propertygrid watches for a property attribute IdeAccessable. For each property to become availdable I override the base property and add this attribute.p  pCode public class MyButton  Button br  nbspnbsp[IdeAccessable]br  nbspnbsppublic new int Height  get  retun base.Height  set  base.Height  value  br br  nbspnbsp[IdeAccessable]br  nbspnbsppublic new int Width  get  retun base.Width   set  base.Width  value   br br  nbspnbsp[IdeAccessable]br  nbspnbsppublic new bool Enabled  get  retun base.Enabled   set  base.Enabled  value br br  nbspnbsp[IdeAccessable]br  nbspnbsppublic new bool Visible   get  retun base.Visible   set  base.Visible  value br br   Codep  pThis works fine for all, but for Enabled and Visible. These two property seem not to be delegated during the Design Time and have no effect what so ever. During serilization the keep their default  base value. How to override enabled amp visible that the work at design time  are delegated properlyp  pDetailsp  pThe a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.componentmodel.design.designsurface.aspx relnofollowDesignSurfacea is used in a standalone application written in c. The designsurface is attached to a standard WinForm which is the basedesignsurface. Items are placed by the user via the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.drawing.design.itoolboxservice.aspx relnofollowToolBoxServicea. The Controls are mostly default winformcontrols like buttons, labels etc. To control the amount of visible items which are shown via a PropertyEditor attached to the DesignSurfaceServices, all controls have been derived see example to flag the properties with the custom IdeAccessableAttribute.p  pWhen these layouts are serialized during save or execution, all controls amp components are represented in a script language lua. During this serilizaion process essentailly a loop over all children lying on the form every control is touched and every property flagges with the IdeAccessable attribute is saved. During debugging I found that, as explained, that values like enabled and visible are not beeing set despite the property editor shows the correct value. This results that a component disabled during designtime is enabled during my own runtime. Another effect is that the property editor settings for the visible property allways is false. Changing it in the property editor shows the correct value but is never applied to the real value.p  pA possible solution might bep  pto prevented this with a fake design time value that is transported manually.p  pThe problem with this solutionp  pDue to the controls not having a shared base class the parts in question would have to be rewritten for every derived control individually which would result in a lot of redundant code. Not derived controls arent anymore possible. Any change to the logic would mean that it has to be changed in about 50 classes. Also implementing new controls would result in much more work than nessary. p

Negative 80825 pIve looped through an NSArray of NSDictionary objects that contain the data for several images to be displayed.

Also ello would not match because the world is hello.p  pUsing Full Text Search, this can easily be achieved by doing a search ofBr  AGAINST hello world IN BOOLEAN MODEp  pProblem is, I dont believe I can use a full text search, since a full text search would find all rows that contains a single phrase.  I want all phrases from a known set of phrases that match a single set.p  pI know how to do this using RegEx using the following, however this is way to slow. On a table with 400,000 key phrases it took over 40 secondsp  pWHERE the data I know I want to search goes here REGEXP CONCAT[[lt]], codephrasescode, [[]]p  pWhat I need is a more optimized way to do this.  How would I possibly go about doing this as a full text search, even if i have to temporarily add it to a table without actually doing a LOOP individually checking each keyword.p  pI really appreciate the feedback as this is really causing my site to lag on adding new data.p

Negative 80825 pI have a DB running on SQL Server 2005 that has a userdefined data type.

Negative 80825 pIve never had much of a need for UserControls until recently.  The reason is too lengthy and out of scope for this thread.p  pI will say that the UserControls have to be loaded dynamically. The variable in which to load the UserControls is stored in a custom server controls property, which of course resides in ViewState.p  pMy problem, as many others developers have expressed, is that the UserControl will not retain ViewState  All the best opinions say to load the UserContol during the Init stage of the Page life cycle. But if I load the UserControl from CustomServerControls ViewState, I cannot do this in the Init phase, because ViewState has not been initialized.p  pWhat is driving me crazy is that the Asp Framwork will route events Button clicks etc. to a UserControl but it is not smart enough to load the ViewState.p  pMaybe this is simply a rant, but I wish I could find an answer for this simple questionp  pWhy cant a UserControl retain ViewState LIKE ANY OTHER WebControl when loading is required in the PageLoad phasep

Negative 80825 pThis is an ugly one. I wish I wasnt having to ask this question, but the project is already built such that we are handling heavy loads of validations in the database. Essentially, Im trying to build a function that will take two stacks of data, weave them together with an unknown batch of operations or comparators, and produce a long string.p  pYes, that was phrased very poorly, so Im going to give an example. I have a form that can have multiple iterations of itself. For some reason, the system wants to know if the entered start date on any of these forms is equal to the entered end date on any of these forms. Unfortunately, due to the way the system is designed, everything is stored as a string, so I have to format it as a date first, before I can compare. Below is pseudo code, so please dont correct me on my syntaxp  pstrongInput datastrongp  precodelogFormValidationtodate  todate                   , formname.control1name, formname.control2name codepre  pNow, as I mentioned, there are multiple iterations of this form, and I need to loop build a fully recursive comparison note it may not always be typical boolean comparisons, it could be internally called functions as well, so .In or anything like that wont work. In the end, I need to get it into a format like below so the validation parser can read it.p  precodeORtodateformname.control1name.1  todateformname.control2name.1    ,todateformname.control1name.2  todateformname.control2name.1    ,todateformname.control1name.3  todateformname.control2name.1    ,todateformname.control1name.1  todateformname.control2name.2            ,todateformname.control1name.n  todateformname.control2name.n codepre  pYeah, its ugly...but given the way our validation parser works, I dont have much of a choice. Any input on how this might be accomplished Im hoping for something more efficient than a double recursive loop, but dont have any ideas beyond thatp  pOkay, seeing as my question is apparently terribly unclear, Im going to add some more info. I dont know what comparison I will be performing on the items, Im just trying to reformat the data into something useable for ANY given function. If I were to do this outside the database, itd look something like this. Note Pseudocode.  is the place marker in a function for vals1,  is a place marker for vals2.p  precodefunction dynamicRecursiveValidationstring functionStr, strArray vals1, strArray vals2   string finalFunction  OR   foreachi in vals1     foreachj in vals2       finalFunction  functionStr.replace, i.replace, j  ,           finalFunction.substring0, finalFunction.length  1 to remove last comma   finalFunction      return finalFunction  codepre  pThat is all Im trying to accomplish.

Negative 80825 pId like to map a domain model to a relational database using one of the ORM frameworks for Java.

So far so good...p  pBut what shall I do with the Tradeable interface I would have to setup a separate hierarchy and map Stock in both hierarchies.

I tried a couple of other obscure things that didnt work either.p  pAnyway, mapping Stock twice wouldnt be a good solution as the application would have to remember adding Stock instances twice  once for each interface.

Negative 80825 pI have an app that uploads Video to YouTube to a specific YouTube channel meaning, not to any individual users channel, but to a single channel, for which I have the Username and Password. p  pIn the ClientLogin my serverside process provided YouTube with the UP and everything moved ahead. However, thats being deprecated and Im looking to upgrade to OAuth 2.0 as per their recommendation, however, the documentation insists on there being a redirect URI, for when the user has logged in.  It doesnt seem to explain how to bypass the user login since the user has nothing to log into, or any credentials to log in with... the app is designed to take their video and upload it to OUR channel. So, what I need is to bypass the user being asked anything, and for YouTube to simply take my channel credentials and give me back the token for me to do the upload with.p  pI realize that this is a totally standard and noncontroversial procedure, so I MUST be missing something obvious, but I just cant suss out what that is. p  pSo, my question is, how do I skip the user dialog redirect and just provide youtube with credentials for it to accept and then upload my video in OAuth 2.0p  pWhat Im really after is to do follow the DirectUpload approach here a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comyoutube2.0developersguideprotocolAuthSubAuthenticationFlowhttpsdevelopers.google.comyoutube2.0developersguideprotocolAuthSubAuthenticationFlowa And to have retrieved the user Token silently behind the scenes. p  pTIA  p

Negative 80825 pIm currently working on implementation of machine learning algorithms on MRMPI MapReduce on MPI.

After the map step there is a collate operation and then followed by a reduce operation. For a collate operation we need some data movement to happen across the nodes. In this regard i would like to know what is the difference in data movement mechanismsbetween nodes in HDFS Vs GPFS Vs MPI.p  pI appreciate if you provide me some good explanation and can give me some good references on each of these so i can get into further details.p  pThanks.p

Negative 80825 pWe have a COM component project and one Windows setup project which registers the COM component. I have checked the previous build of the setup project, it seems that the CLSID generated for the classes in COM project always change, even though sometimes there is no change in those classes. This is somehow our desired way because we want to keep different versions implementations at the same machine. However, when I build this project manually and run regasm.exe with regfile option several times at the same day, the CLSID in the generated reg file are always the same. It think in the previous cases where they changed, it is because they were built at different days, but I am not sure. So could anyone tell me what is the default rule of this CLSID autogeneration I think we are using the default settings in the project.p  pI am not sure whether the assembly version affects the result. But we assign the assembly version number as Major.Minor., which means the third number build number is the days since 1.1.2000 and the fourth number revision number is number of seconds since midnight divided by two. In the case that the CLSID changes even though the classes code dont change, the major and minor numbers are also the same. So if the version number does affect the CLSID, I can tell that it doesnt only take major and minor numbers into account.p  pAnd of course we didnt assign static GUIDs for those classes otherwise it would not change in our setup project.p  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 80825 pI am writing an ntiered application that uses the Sync Framework v2.1 in combination with a WCF web service. My code is based on this example a hrefhttpcode.msdn.microsoft.comDatabaseSyncSQLServer7e88adab relnofollowDatabaseSyncap  pSyncing seems to work without a problem. But, when I add the batching functionality I get an error that is proving difficult to debug. p  pIn the client portion of the solution a WPF app, I have a virtual class that inherits from KnowledgeSyncProvider. It also implements the IDisposable interface. I use this class to call the WCF service I wrote and use the sync functionality there.  When the sync code runs orchestrator.Synchronize is called, everything seems to work correctly and the EndSession function override that I have written runs without error. But, after execution leaves that function, a System.Error occurs from within Microsoft.Synchronization.CoreInterop.ISyncSession.Start as far as I can tell. p  pThe functions I have written to provide the IDisposable functionality are never called so, something is happening after EndSession, but before my applications KnowledgeSyncProvider virtual class can be disposed. p  pHere is the error informationp  pmessage System error.

Negative 80825 pThis is a bit of a brain teaser and I have been trying to think of how to do it for a while. Not sure if the title gives away enough but its the best i could do.p  pI have a centralized audio playing system in a site that I am developing at the moment. By centralized I mean everything on the site plays through it, so only one track can be playing at once and it will also make continuous play doable.p  pBefore I go into detail about the players I should explain parts of the site. The site hosts music and other things for musicians. The musicians are voted in to be on the site by users. To vote a user will click vote, listen to the track and click like or dislike, simple Once the track has enough likes the tracks creator will become part of the site and will be able to upload more tracks to there profile as well as other things. That should explain what this part of the site is about so I can go into detail about the players.p  pThere are 2 players, one in the toolbar and an in page one which there can be several of, kind of like soundclouds players. Everything is linked together so if a track is played on an inpage player it is played in the toolbar player and vice versa.p  pThe audio players are built with jQuery.p  pThere are also 3 things the user can do to trigger audio playp  ol liPlay the newest track which is shown in the toolbar player.li liPlay a track in the in page player.li liClick vote and listen to a random track to vote on.li ol  pNow the problem I am having is with the mysql queries and how they are selected. Because each of the 3 triggers the user can send need different mysql queries I need to think of a way to select the query for each trigger.p  pIn the queries below I have left out variables and the queries that get the information about the artist based on the track selected.p  pQuery for 1 toolbar playerp  precodefetchtrack  mysqlquerySELECT  FROM tracks ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 1 track  mysqlfetcharrayfetchurl  url  track[url] codepre  pQuery for 2 in page playerp  precodefetchtrack  mysqlquerySELECT  FROM tracks WHERE trackID  Variable for the selected track track  mysqlfetcharrayfetchurl  url  track[url] codepre  pQuery for 3 votep  precode Set up artist query so no artists are shown and cannot be voted on   findartist  mysqlquerySELECT  FROM artists  artist  mysqlfetcharrayfindartist   artist   artist[name]    Set up vote query so that you are not shown a track you have already voted on   findvoted  mysqlquery SELECT  FROM votes WHERE ID  userID  voted  mysqlfetcharrayfindvoted   votedID  voted[trackID]   Query tracks with relevent information   fetchtrack  mysqlquerySELECT  FROM tracks WHERE ID  userID AND trackID  votedID LIMIT 1  track  mysqlfetcharrayfetchtrack  url  track[url] codepre  pOh and just so it helps you get the picture the voting system, toolbar player and in page player are all in separate files and all link to a single js file for the jQuery. The url variable is put into the jQuery as a var.p  pHow would I select the right query for the right thing to happen Or at least select the right outcome of the queriesp  pI am sorry the question is a bit long winded but I needed to explain almost every detail.p

Negative 80825 pcodenumpy.interpcode is very convenient and relatively fast.  In certain contexts Id like to compare its output against a noninterpolated variant where the sparse values are propagated in the denser output and the result is piecewise constant between the sparse inputs.  The function I want could also be called a sparse  dense converter that copies the latest sparse value until it finds a later value a kind of null interpolation as if zero timedistance has ever elapsed from the earlier value.p  pUnfortunately, its not easy to tweak the source for codenumpy.interpcode because its just a wrapper around a compiled function.  I can write this myself using Python loops, but hope to find a Cspeed way to solve the problem.p  pstrongUpdatestrong the solution below codescipy.interpolate.interp1dcode with codekindzerocode is quite slow and takes more than 10 seconds per call e.g. input 500k in length thats 50 populated.  It implements codekindzerocode using a zeroorder spline and the call to codesplevalcode is very slow.  However, the source code for codekindlinearcode i.e. default interpolation gives an excellent template for solving the problem using straight numpy minimal change is to set codeslope0code.  That code shows how to use codenumpy.searchsortedcode to solve the problem and the runtime is similar to calling codenumpy.interpcode, so problem is solved by tweaking the codescipy.interpolate.interp1dcode implementation of linear interpolation to just skip the interpolation step slope  0 blends the adjacent values.p

Adding time.sleeps to the last line of the thread allows to see the panel inside the frame for s seconds, while the thread is frozen, proving that the panel was in fact created.p  pHeres the code for the frame that may interess youp  precodeself.BindMyEvents.EVTCONTROLNEWPANEL,self.ChangePanel def ChangePanelself,event     if self.panel  None         self.panel.Hide     self.panel  event.panel     self.panel.Show codepre  pand the one for the threading.thread subclassp  precodeclass ThreadExecutethreading.Thread     def initself,func,args         threading.Thread.initself         self.func  func         self.args  args         self.start      def runself         applyself.func,self.args  CreateRandomPanelparent     panel  RandomPanelparent     event  MyEvents.ControlNewPanelpanel  panel     wx.PostEventparent,event codepre  pIs there a way to keep the object alive after the thread is over Is pickling the object on the Thread and depickling it on the frame a good alternative p  pstrongEditedstrongp  pA small runable example of the codep  precodeimport wx import threading from wx.lib.newevent import NewEvent from time import sleep  NewPanelEvent, EVTNEWPANEL  NewEvent class MyFramewx.Frame     def initself         wx.Frame.initself,None,sizewx.Size350,350         self.panel  None                 self.BindEVTNEWPANEL,self.ChangePanel         self.control  MyControlself         self.control.NewPanel      def ChangePanelself,event          if self.panel  None             self.panel.Hide          self.panel  event.panel         self.Refresh  class MyPanelwx.Panel     def initself,parent,size         wx.Panel.initself,parent,sizesize         self.btn  wx.Buttonself,labelhit me,poswx.Point25,25,sizewx.Size75,25         self.SetBackgroundColourwx.Colour255,255,0  class MyControlobject     def initself,window         self.window  window      def NewPanelself         MyThreadRandomFunction,self.window,  class MyThreadthreading.Thread     def initself,func,args         threading.Thread.initself         self.func  func         self.args  args         self.start      def runself         applyself.func,self.args  def RandomFunctionwindow     sleep3     size  window.GetSizeTuple     size  250,250      panel  MyPanelwindow,sizesize     event  NewPanelEventpanel  panel     wx.PostEventwindow,event      use the sleep to prevent the thread from ending, so you can see the panel     sleep5  class Appwx.App     def OnInitself         self.frame  MyFrame         self.frame.Show         self.SetTopWindowself.frame         return True  def main     app  AppFalse     app.MainLoop  if name  main     main codepre

Negative 80825 pWe are creating interactive SVG diagrams containing a large number of irregular rectangles. Our user clicks within an area of the SVG and based on that we provide more information about that object.  Im simplifying slightly  this is an industrial application and the areas are not actually rectangles  but Ill assume we can use each shapes bounding rectangle.p  pUnfortunately some of the rectangles entirely contain some of the other rectangles.   For example R2 could be a small rectangle entirely contained the within another rectangle R1.  Provided that R2 is added to the SVG file strongAFTERstrong R1 then the small rectangle R2 is interactive.  Unfortunately the input stream of objects does not guarantee this. I may get R2 after R1.  Then R1 is printed afterwards and hence R2 cannot be clicked because its completely covered by R1.  The objects are semitransparent so R1 remains visible  is just not clickable  most annoyingp  pThus we want to  sort our rectangle array such that  all i less than j we can guarantee that Ri is not containted in Rj. But apart from this we want to make the minimum disturbance to the z order of the original sequence.   We will have thousands of rectangles to sort  so whatever algorithm we choose had better not have nsquared behaviour.  p  pI thought initially this would be a fairly common problem in graphics systems. But a scan of the literature doesnt seem to suggest it is.  I have some ideas myself for working on this  including splitting space up into regions KDtree and or sorting the rectangles by area little rectangles cant contain big rectangles  However, it would be nicer to find a good solution for this problem already out there.  Perhaps Im simply not using the right search terms.  p  pAny ideas  p
Negative 80825 pI have an openCV application program working, but need to add buttons etc. to the layout.

Negative 80825 pI have populated an html page with a table from the database. I want to add dropdown boxes at the top that can filter out unnecessary data. How would I go about sending this information to the database to make a query so that I can filter out data with multiple variablesp  pFor example, I have 5 categories, A, B, C, D, and E. I have used PHP code to populate the boxes with the possible valuesentries for A, B, C, D, and E. Ive also added a NULL entry in case the user does not want to include this column as part of the filter.p  pSo right now as it stands, for the respective columns we can havep  precodeApple, always, as, amazing, as, almonds, NULL. Belly, boosts, bad, NULL. Candy, can, create, NULL. Dandy, does, do, dont, NULL. Elements, exist, NULL. codepre  pHow would I go about sending the information to the database when the variables are indefinite They may or may not be set.p  pI figured Id start by seeing if the variables were set in the first place by using the isset, but how would I proceed from there It seems like a lot of if statements. All I need to do is to change the query based on the values of the variables the user enters. But I dont see an easy way of doing that.p  pIll simply be adding WHERE A  this AND B  that AND C  thisthat AND .. to the end of the query but what if one or more or all of those entries are null p  pThanks a lot for any help.p
Negative 80825 pI have a series of puzzles Strings of morse code with no spaces between the letters or words.  My plan is to do a dictionary attack to find the best solution candidates. My weapon is Python.p  pI have a list of 17000 English words. I also have a much smaller list of words that are pertinent to the puzzles theme, and if those words show up they should score higher.p  pSo at the very beginning of my script when I generate the list of words, I use a list of tuples of the form word, scoremultiplier. Heres a small subsetp  precode[zoned, 1.0,   zonely, 1.0,   zoner, 1.0,   zones, 1.0,   zoning, 1.0,   zoo, 1.0,   zoom, 1.0,   zoomed, 1.0,   zooming, 1.0,   zooms, 1.0,   zoos, 1.0,   ten, 1.0,   tens, 1.0,   gnash, 1.0,   shag, 1.0,   75th, 2.0,   seventy, 2.0,   fifth, 2.0] codepre  pIn the file that I parse all that out of, I want to just stick the highvalue words at the end, without manually getting rid of any duplicates in the main part of the file. So I need to write something to get rid of the early tuples whose first value is equal to that of a later tuple.p  pI can do this with brute forcep  precodefor firstkey, firstword, firstfactor in enumeratewordlist     for laterkey, laterword, laterfactor in enumeratewordlist[firstkey1]         if firstword  laterword             del wordlist[firstkey]             break codepre  pBut that part of the script alone takes almost 45 seconds, and my 17000 words isnt even a full dictionary. That code is also untested other than the time it takes to finish, so it may not even work. It also seems very unPythony, though Im just now learning Python and doing some of my first programming at all with this very project.p  pIs there a better way to do this I cant use codesetcode because the duplicate words are part of nonequal tuples. Do I need to restructure my data somehow Or should I just be prepared to wait a full minute every time I run thisp

Negative 80825 pI have a program which requests web page, parses it and depends on result decides what to do next.p  pFor example Program should obtain some element from page, lets call it aim element. If program does request and obtains someOtherElement it will continue execution. If it obtains aimElement Executor should click some links, execution ends and we go to the next task. Program has 20 attempts to obtain aimElement. And aimElement could change in the future.p  pSeems simple but I dont really know how to implement this with good oodesign. I am thinking of two objects Task and Executor. Task contains all conditions and Executor receives Task as an argument and does requests based on Tasks needs. But if executor returns raw page to Task itself Task will be to complicated and there will be strong connection between them. If Executor returns already parsed elements of a page then Executor will need to know what and how to parse and will be also complicated and also there will be strong connection.p  pI dont know if my explanation clear or not but maybe you could advice me some design pattern or just share your experience with similar problems.p

I built it specifically to be extendable to deal with different datatypes specifically any object or class I make down the line so that I could link to it as a library in my project as I do other libraries.p  pHowever, even after compiling it into a lib and adding the directory of the lib to the Additional Include Directories, I get an unresolved external error whenever I try to include one of the header files in the library. Ive also tried putting the direct path to it under Additional Dependencies as well as just the library name with the path to the directory set in Additional Include Directories and Additional Library Directories.

Negative 80825 pIm creating live chat application that should be part of my website. Website is fully developed using PHP. Now the problem is Im in dilemma what would be the best appropriate tool for live chat application platform that will become part of my website. It should use Users from my website and share Session with PHP application its part of.p  pI did some research and as I thought  PHPApache is not really the best tool for development of applications based on web sockets like my live chat is. Other platforms like Node.js looks like the right choice but Im not sure how easy it will be to make Node to share resources with my PHP application. p  pIm interested what approach would you use for situations like this What architecture of the system would you implementp  pFor the end I want to tell you that my PHP website is MySQL based and Im using knockoutJS for clientside implementation. It will use SocketIO on clientside because of it fallback strategies and support for nonHTML5 browsers. I know it can be used on serverside too but Im doubting between it and Node or some other solution currently unknown to me. Thats the main reason why Im asking this question here. There is a small possibility that it will be running on shared hosting but I fully understand problems with shared hosting and socket connection closed ports, noSSH for installing Node etc.. If you have suggestions regarding this possibility  write it down. Otherwise just forget about it and answer like its going to run on VPS.p  pThanks.p

Negative 80825 pstrongULTIMATE GOAL Make a formed transparency where images can show through but are shaped by the form itself. The images are rollover buttons and turn from grayscale to color with hoverstrongp  pSo the picture below link shows what I want to happen in Dreamweaver CS6. I used PS to create this image. I simply took the person portion and deleted it so the picture turned out as a white box with a transparent inside. My plan was to simply plant this image into DW and then place the rest of the color images beneath it by placement of the IMG tag.p  pI figured it would turn out like what you see below but it has not. I simply get a full white page tested offline, not uploaded to the server. If I add a picture, there is no hint that the PNG with the transparency is even existent.p  pSo now, what would be your suggestions Would it be easier to just use FW and make slices of the work as seen below In that case I would just have to match all the pieces of the body up like Tetris when working in DW. It just seems there is a MUCH easier way of doing this and somehow I am making it extremely hard.p  pPlease ask if you need further information.

But in example 1 there is only extremely high frequency of both and only two values, and in example 2 there is extremely high frequency of one value 0 and no repeat frequency for the exceptions. p  pBut my ideas are all based pretty much on conjecture... so.

Negative 80825 pI have an attendance recording system that has 2 databases, one for current, another for archiving. The server processes attendance records, and puts records marked completed into the archive. There is no processing done in the archive database.p  pHeres the issue. One of the requirement was to build a blank record for each staff every day, for which attendance records are put into. The agent that does this calls a few procedures and does some checking within the database. As of current, there are roughly 1,800 blank records created daily. On the development PC, processing each records takes roughly 2 to 3 seconds, which translates to an average of an hour and a half. However, when we deployed it on the server, processing each records takes roughly 7 seconds, roughly translates into 3 and a half hours to complete. We have had instances when the agent takes 4.5 to 5 hours to complete. p  pNote that in both instances, agents are scheduled. There are no other lotus apps in the server, and the server is free and idle most of the time no other application except Windows Server and Lotus Notes. Is there anything that could cause the additional processing time compared on the development PC and the server p

Negative 80825 pI would like to perform automated tests of a networked device that supports Telnet and SSH. Once a connection is established, I am able to query the status of the device with various ASCII strings, to which I receive an ASCII response. Ideally, I would like to create a spreadsheet with a string sent column, a expected response column, and an actual response column, which I can then compare to the expected using custom formatting.p  pSo far, I am able to communicate with it using Python with the telnetlib and reference the spreadsheet from the Python script. However, I would prefer to initiate this process from Excel, since it is easier to set up my test requirements. The only solution I can think of is to have a macro createmodify the Python script based on each string sent cell value and location, and subsequently manually run that script from the Python IDLE GUI. I heard Python works from within Excel with a reference to the Microsoft Script Control, but documentation on how to use it is close to nonexistent.p  pIs there a more direct methodp  pI would prefer to stick to Windows 7, but Linux is available. I would prefer to stick to Microsoft Excel, but any other method of graphically editing the requirements and subsequently viewing the results could be acceptable. Once upon a time I did JUnit testing, but I cant recall how easily that could be set up for this sort of test. Plus there isnt much Java literacy among my peers.p

Negative 80825 pWhat I currently have is a pretty naive implementation that chunks the data and processes it. It runs in around 34 seconds for a file of 816mb, but I want it to be faster than that. Ive already profiled it to see what bits take the most time, but most of what takes an appreciable amount of time is centered around python module functions. As a result, Im stuck as to what I can do to improve performance. Any and all help would be very welcome.

Negative 80825 pI have a large, but potentially varying, number of objects which are concurrently written into. I want to protect that access with mutexes. To that end, I thought I use a codestdvectorltstdmutexgtcode, but this doesnt work, since codestdmutexcode has no copy or move constructor, while codestdvectorresizecode requires that.p  pWhat is the recommended solution to this conundrump  pstrongeditstrong Do all C randomaccess containers require copy or move constructors for resizing Would stddeque helpp  pstrongedit againstrongp  pFirst, thanks for all your thoughts. Im not interested in solutions that avoid mutices andor move them into the objects I refrain from giving detailsreasons. So given the problem that I want a adjustable number of mutices where the adjustment is guaranteed to occur when no mutex is locked, then there appear to be several solutions.p  pstrong1strong I could use a fixed number of mutices and use a hashfunction to map from objects to mutices as in Captain Oblivouss answer. This will result in collisions, but the number of collisions should be small if the number of mutices is much larger than the number of threads, but still smaller than the number of objects.p  pstrong2strong I could define a wrapper class as in ComicSansMSs answer, e.g.p  precodestruct mutexwrapper  stdmutex    mutexwrapper  default   mutexwrappermutexwrapper constamp noexcept  stdmutex    bool operatormutexwrapper constampother noexcept  return thisampother   codepre  pand use a codestdvectorltmutexwrappergtcode.p  pstrong3strong I could use codestduniqueptrltstdmutexgtcode to manage individual mutexes as in Matthiass answer. The problem with this approach is that each mutex is individually allocated and deallocated on the heap. Therefore, I preferp  pstrong4strong codestduniqueptrltstdmutex[]gt mutices new stdmutex[nmutex] codep  pwhen a certain number codenmutexcode of mutices is allocated initially. Should this number later be found insufficient, I simplyp  precodeifneedmutex gt nmutex    mutices.reset new stdmutex[needmutex]    nmutex  needmutex  codepre  pSo which of these 1,2,4 should I usep

Negative 80825 pYes this might be a duplicate of a million other questions like it, but for me it still doesnt work. According to the jQuery validation documentation, simply having the first default item with an empty value value, and the class required is enough. But it refuses to work correctly. I have everything set up correctly, and it works fine on checkboxes, radiobuttons, text inputs no problem at all, but select lists Nope.p  pHere is a simple examplep  precodeltselect classrequired iddayDropdown databindvalue StudentBaseData.daygt     ltoption valuegtDagltoptiongt ltselectgt ltselect classrequired idmonthDropdown databindvalue StudentBaseData.monthgt     ltoption valuegtMnedltoptiongt ltselectgt ltselect classrequired idyearDropdown databindvalue StudentBaseData.yeargt     ltoption valuegtrltoptiongt ltselectgt codepre  pThree dropdownlists, all required. Right here, the odd thing is ONLY the first select validates. The other two are ignored. Further down the page i have two more select lists that refuses any kind of validation.p  pHere is where i initiate the validation pluginp  precodefunction     .metadata.setTypeattr, validate     StudentsForm.validate         ignore        codepre  pAnd i force trigger the validation when the form is submittedp  precodeupdateProfileButton.clickfunction subscribe      ifStudentsForm.valid true force trigger validation          do stuff      else   if jquery validation fails          TODO       codepre  pAnd like i said, it works for everything BUT select lists.p  pIf it matters, the select lists are automatically populated by two javascript functions filling out dates etc., but the initial default value is set like i have shown above. The strange thing is it works for the first select box, and thats it.p  pI have searched and searched and i have never found anyone with the same problem.p  pPS The databind is from knockout.js.p

Negative 80825 pI have a cocoa application where i need to respond to keyDown events during dragging sessions in order to trigger other things. The keys are not modifiers only but can be any kind of key.p  pThe problem is, when i start a dragging session by calling NSWindow.dragImage, i dont get keyDown events during that dragging operation. When i drag an external resource overinto the application window e.g. a file from Finder it works fine, NSView.keyDown gets called.p  pIs there any way of getting around this Thanks youp

Is there a reason one would use this approach Has this something to do with not introducing direct dependencies in the factory object to objects inside the NuGet packageli liLets assume the referenced NuGet package works with HttpContext under the hood. Would registering my factory in singleton scope have any negative effect on HttpContext or does that not matter since I assume the NuGet package most likely manages the scope of HttpContext itselfli liFinally, the DotLessFactory will eventually be used with Bundles Microsoft.AspNet.Web.Optimization NuGet package and the Bundle is only instantiated not managed by container on Application Start. The Bundle will depend on an injected instance of DotLessFactory. Does this fact make any difference to the questions aboveli ol  pAny feedback would be extremely helpful.p

I am not asking for anyone to do my work for me but to simply just lead me in the right direction.p  precodeltscript typetextjavascript srclibjsjquery.nivo.slider.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srclibjsjquery.fancybox.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srclibjsjquery.jcarousel.min.jsgtltscriptgt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt      nivo     window.loadfunction           slider.nivoSlider effect slideInLeft, pauseTime 5000             fancybox     document.readyfunction          .fancybox.fancybox         .fancybox.openwelcome,  padding  0            subscribe     footersubscribeshowhide.clickfunction           footersubscribe.animatewidthtoggle,300         this.showsubscribe             responsive     function           .menumobiledrop.clickfunction              .menumobile.toggle                    .menuwrap.clickfunction           this.findimg.toggle           subscriptionAjax     subscriber.submitfunctionevent          event.preventDefault         footersubscribe.fadeOut         var values  this.serialize         .ajax              url includesubscribe.php,             type post,             data values,             success function                 footersubscribe                 .html                     ltdiv classsubscriptionsuccessgtYoure now subscribedltdivgt                                  .fadeInslow             ,             error function                 alertfailure                  footersubscribe.htmlthere is error while submit                                  jcarousel     function mycarouselinitCallbackcarousel          carousel.clip.hoverfunction               carousel.stopAuto         ,          function              carousel.startAuto                   jQuerydocument.readyfunction          jQuerymycarousel.jcarousel             auto 8,             wrap last,             initCallback mycarouselinitCallback                ltscriptgt codepre

Negative 80825 pWhats the difference between the twop  pAs far as I understand it, MATLAB Compiler wraps the MATLAB code into a .exe file so that it can be used without installing MATLAB, and only requires the MCR. On top of it MATLAB Builder NE can also be used to produce .Net assemblies to be used with .Net framework instead of the .exe file, but they still require MCR.p  pNow I dont understand what MATLAB Coder used for It generates CC code. But is the MATLAB code really converted into CC, or is it merely packaged like in the case of MATLAB Compiler Does it also need the MCR to runp  pI understand that this is not exactly a programming question. But I have searched the internet and still havent found a clear answer. These are very expensive products so I would like to know what I am getting into.p

Negative 80825 pI have a project in which I need to make neural network for face recognition.  Inputs of network should be features of face which needs to be recognized.p  pI searched a lot and found SURF Detector of Matlabs Computer Vision Toolbox to be the one which will help me extract the features of face. But SURF Detector extracts keypoints of face and for each of them sets vector with 64 or 128 values. Problem is that the number of keypoints varies,and I need it to be same for each face, to be able to feed the inputs of neural network.p  pSo i thought to extract only some features which can be presented as single number, like proportions of nose,mouth,eyes to the face, or distance between eyes, etc.br How can i get these features, and will they be good enough to serve as inputs to neural network which will need to recognize faces On the output of neural network there will be same number of neurons as there is different people in database, and in training phase Im going to feed the network with extracted face features from photo, and if it is photo of lets say third of five people in database, my output layer will look like [0,0,1,0,0].p  pIs this good approach and can you give me some code which extracts those face features from face in Matlabp

But however firebug also says that my table inherits its style p  precodetr, td  border 1px solid DDDDDD  codepre  pfrom a file called nature.css which comes with the beez20 template i think. Its quite annoying that only this little change destroys the whole looking of my table.  And Im not able to find a solution how to change the style of my table without changing the templates CSS. Due to the fact that it would just have changes for me but not for these users who install this module too. So Im wondering why doesnt Joomla use my CSS and instead of this, overrides it with its ownp

Negative 80825 pCan I access object properties as a typep  pI am using an API where I have to iterate through a collection of objects, and access the codeTextcode properties of two of these objects, either for reading or for writing. I currently have two methods for reading and writing as followsp  precodeResult ReadTexts     var attribs  SOMECODE     string first  , second        forint i1  i lt attribs.Count  i          ifattribs[i] ISFIRSTONENEEDED              first  attribs[i].Text          else ifattribs[i] ISSECONDONENEEDED              second  attribs[i].Text                   return new Resultfirst, second   void WriteTextsstring first, string second      var attribs  SOMECODE      forint i1  i lt attribs.Count  i          ifattribs[i] ISFIRSTONENEEDED              attribs[i].Text  first          else ifattribs[i] ISSECONDONENEEDED              attribs[i].Text  second                codepre  pWhat I would prefer is using a more functional style which factors out the iteration and checking for the two objects in the collection into one method instead of repeating this code, as actually SOMECODE as well as ISFIRSTONENEEDED and ISSECONDONENEEDED are a bit longer in reality than in the above sample code. This one method would look likep  precodevoid AccessTextsActionltStringPropertygt first, ActionltStringPropertygt second      var attribs  SOMECODE      forint i1  i lt attribs.Count  i          ifattribs[i] ISFIRSTONENEEDED              firstattribs[i].Text          else ifattribs[i] ISSECONDONENEEDED              secondattribs[i].Text                codepre  pand then call this with lambda expressions likep  precodeAccessTexts prop gt prop  abc,  prop gt prop  def codepre  pfor writing, orp  precodeAccessTexts prop gt firstString  prop,  prop gt secondString  prop codepre  pfor reading. This would be much shorter and avoid repeating a lot of code.p  pBut I think this is not possible, as properties are not exposed as a real type in .net, but are just based on the availability of special methods  the getter and setter. Hence, there is no type codeStringPropertycode as I used it as type of the delegate parameter in the code sample of what I would like to write.p  pAm I right, or is there some way to implement it the way I wantp

Negative 80825 pSo this has been keeping me busy all day.p  pI am customizing a gallery in which the user can select one or multiple images, for which I am using an existing project which makes use of a codeCursorLoadercode. Almost every project uses the media gallery URI to query all images on the memory. However, I only want a specific directory to be scanned and the images within displayed.p  pFew lines of code which do partly what I wantp  precodefinal String imagesDirectory  storagesdcard0DCIM String selection  MediaStore.Images.Media.DATA   LIKE   imagesDirectory   cl  new CursorLoaderMultiImageChooserActivity.this, MediaStore.Images.Media.EXTERNALCONTENTURI, img.toArraynew String[img.size], selection, null, null codepre  pThe selection part of this code I found on SO as well, but it also retrieves all images in subdirectories, which I do not want. A solution could be to check whether the the codeMediaStore.Images.Media.DATAcode column contains the same amount of slashes as codeimagesDirectorycode, which should workp  precodeimagesDirectory storagesdcard0DCIM                   gt 4 storagesdcard0DCIMphoto.jpg                           gt 4, direct child storagesdcard0DCIMsubdirotherphoto.jpg               gt 5, in subdir codepre  pI found that in SQLite, a query like this should work to check the occurences of thecodecodep  precodeSELECT LENGTHcol  LENGTHREPLACEcol, ,  codepre  pin which codecolcode should be codeMediaStore.Images.Media.DATAcode, but as of yet Ive tried a lot of different codeselectioncode variants, but I havent managed to filter the data. And since you cant give a codeCursorLoadercode a coderawQuerycode like a codeCursorcode, I couldnt do that either.p  pAnother thing I tried was to not use codeMediaStore.Images.Media.EXTERNALCONTENTURIcode as content URI, but rather a URI from the directory. So I tried thisp  precodefinal String imagesDirectory  storagesdcard0DCIM cl  new CursorLoaderMultiImageChooserActivity.this,      Uri.fromFilenew FileimagesDirectory,      img.toArraynew String[img.size], null, null, null codepre  pbut to no avail thusfar. p  pstrongQuestion How do I query all images in a directory, but not its subdirectories, using a codeCursorLoadercodestrongp  pIm no hero with SQLite, queries and codeCursorLoaderscode, so that might explain a little. Also, I did search SO for similar questions, but theres not much to find on this particular topic. Even Googling codedirectory cursorloadercode does not answer anything. Most result are SO posts about sorting by directory... p  pThanks in advance.p

A kmer is a substring of the genetic code that might have some meaning. codetcode is the number of times a kmer appears in appears in a clump. codeLcode is the length of text that forms a clump. For example, if codeL  400code we are looking for a kmer that occurs codetcode times within a clump of 400 characters.p  pOutput  All distinct kmers forming L, tclumps in Genome.p  pThis code takes the genome, breaks it up into all possible kmers and inserts those kmers into a dictionary. The kmers are keys. The values are set up like  code[frequencyofkmer, [kmer locations]]code. That value is stored like this in the dictionary codeAAAAA  [y, [z1,z2]]code, where codeycode is the number of occurrences, and codez1code and codez2code are the indices in the string where the substring is found.p  pBasically, I am looking to iterate over the dictionary. I want to find the keys that occur codetcode number of times within the text. That is, strongI want to find all keys of a dictionary codedcode such that coded[key]tcode.strongp  pCode below, followed by the output.p  pstrongCodestrongp  precodefrom pprint import pprint genome  CGGACTCGACAGATGTGAAGAAATGTGAAGACTGAGTGAAGAGAAGAGGAAACACGACACGACATTGCGACATAATGTACGAATGTAATGTGCCTATGGC k  5 L  75 t  4 lengenome  intlengenome l  []  for i in range lengenome  k  1     kmer  genome[ii k]      list of every possible kmer     l.appendkmer  d   for i in range lenl     try         d[l[i]][0]  1         d[l[i]][1].appendi     except KeyError         d[l[i]]  [1, [i]]  pprintd codepre

This should modify my view and for that I am listening on model change event in my view. Because of 1000 parts modification 1000 change events will get triggered. p  pDue to manufacturer change I may also want to change manufacturerDate attribute of Part model, and if I change manufacturerDate attr too which in turn will trigger another 1000 events.p  pHandling these much events in my view might not be a good idea thats what I feel.

Negative 80825 pThe traditional way to host multiple websites on a single IP was to use a shared host and use an Apache virtualhost config for each site. Thus different domain names mapped to the  different sites based on a virtualhost lookup but they all went to the same IP. However I would like to knowp  pstrongIs possible to have multiple webservers on a private LAN that can all be accessed on port 80 through a single public facing routerdnswhatever which uses a single public IP.strongp  pIdeally the different servers would be accessed by subdomains, such as server1.mysite.com and server2.mysite.com. This is fairly easy to do if your webservers are allowed to serve websites on different ports with portforwarding, but I need the outside world to not have to know what port to connect on and be able to just input server1.mydomain.com into their browser instead of server1.mydomain.com1234p  pThis is only an issue due to the increasing scarcity of IPv4 addresses and IPv6 isnt ready yet.p

Negative 80825 pI am building an app that shows users friends realtime locations on a map. Each user updates his currnet location on the server Parse.com every defined interval time and distance.

Negative 80825 pTLDRp  ul liHow do I build a static library without including a third party library that Im referencingli ul  hr  pHi,p  pBefore I begin, I know how to compile a static library in Xcode targeted for iOS devices and simulators. However, this time around I have a dependency on a third party library strongthat I do not want to includestrong in the static library. I simply want to reference it. However, whenever I am building my static library I get a stronglexical or preprocessor errorstrong, which I know is common when the library is missing from the project. The error occurs because I removed the library from the project, because I didnt want to have it built into the static library.p  pThe library in question is AFNetworking. I will be using CocoaPods to explicitly have the dependency installed when installing my static library.p  pThank you.p

Negative 80825 pI have a PCAP file that was given to me for a Forensics Challenge.  The PCAP has encrypted traffic using TLS Version 1.  I have looked into a BEAST attack but there are no tools to do this.  Is there anyway using just the packets I have in the PCAP file to decrypt this traffic in wireshark without the private key Can I get the private key from the certificate exchange in anyways or the master secret log or something I could not find any tutorials online that do not involve having access to the private key.  Any help is appreciated.  Thanks.p  pUPDATEp  pThank you, my later researched revealed that version 1 of TLS did have vulnerabilities and that it was possible to do but I would have needed access to the actual host as well not just the PCAP of its traffic.

Negative 80825 pThe RAII Resource Acquisition Is Initialization is one of the suggested ways of constructing objects. How does it relate to the unit testing principles that are saying no complex job done in the constructor And especially no explicit creation of objects by new operator However creation of some objects requires some more complex steps sometimes, and passing a factory to a constructor makes the API dirty in the meaning of decreasing the legibility. What are the general ways of meeting both of the principles at the same timep  pI have found the other topic on SO a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7806985stackallocatedraiiobjectsvsdiprincipleStack allocated RAII objects vs DI principlea, however it looks like a more general problem and it is not explained well.p

Negative 80825 pI am trying to run a hrefhttpsgithub.comnodeinspectornodeinspector relnofollownodeinspectora with an Express 4 App  I am running this in a Vagrant box but am able to view the pages in the browser without any problems I have the ports on the vagrant machine available to the host machine. p  pI fire up the application either with codenpm startcode or codenode debug binwwwcode and then start the nodedebugger codebinwwwcode. I load the inspector in the browser and it hits the initial breakpoint on the first line but performing any action on the page to debug that would trigger a breakpoint causes an codeEADDRINUSEcode aka the port is in use error. Im a little baffled as to what could be causing this, however, its very possible Im using commands that would work on Express 3 instead of 4. Additionally, maybe there is some configuration I am missing to run the debugger on the browser of the hostmachine but running inspector on the vagrant boxp

Negative 80825 pThe problem is as follows I connected the codeListBoxcode with a list of elements of some custom class codeListltPersongt persons  new ListltPersongtcode using codeDataSourcecode property. Of course codeValueMembercode and codeDisplayMembercode are both assigned to appropriate properties of this class. When I first load data, everything looks ok.

Someone in marketing decides that in English the string should be codes minutes left, hurry upcode.  What do I do  On the one hand, I can change the codemsgidcode.  On the plus side, it becomes evident that the translation in Language needs to be updated but the string change requires a developer to update a source file, which doesnt sound like good use of the developers time when there are so many features to implement and time is scarce.  On the other hand, a translator could update the msgstr in English, so as to match the marketing persons request, but then how do I notify translators that they have to update their translation  Also, all they see is the codemsgidcode, which hasnt changed.  So how to I tell them what the actual string isp  pThanks to anyone who can help.p

Negative 80825 pMy question is inspired by a comment on the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2359253solvingembarassinglyparallelproblemsusingpythonmultiprocessingsolving embarassingly parallel problem with multiprocessinga post.p  pI am asking about the general case where python multiprocessing is used to 1 read data from file, 2 manipulate data, 3 write results to file. In the case I describe, data that is read from file is passed to a queue A in 1 and fetched from this queue A in 2. 2 also passes results to a separate queue B and 3 fetches results from this queue B to write them to file.p  pWhen 1 is done, it passes a STOP signal to queue A so 2 knows queue A is empty. 2 then terminates and passes a STOP signal to queue B so 3 knows queue B is empty and terminates when it has used up the results queue.  p  pSo is there any need to call the multiprocessing a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2librarymultiprocessing.htmlmultiprocessing.Process.join relnofollow.join methoda on 1 and 2 I would have thought that 2 will not finish until 1 finishes and sends a STOP signal For 3 it makes sense to wait as any subsequent instructions might else proceed without 3.p  pBut maybe calling the .join method costs nothing and can be used just to avoid having to think about itp  hr  pactually, the STOP signal consists of a sequence of N stop signals where N is equivalent to the number of processes running in 2.p
Negative 80825 pCan I sendreceive any sort of objectp  pLooking at the method signature, it uses a hrefhttpdocs.jboss.orgnetty3.2apiorgjbossnettychannelMessageEvent.html relnofollowMessageEventap  precodepublic void messageReceivedChannelHandlerContext ctx, MessageEvent e throws Exception  codepre  pwhich, according to the API, inherits from Object.  So, just cast that whatever type is expected  Or, perhaps, use codeinstanceofcodep  pFrom the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiNetty28software29NettyTCPExample relnofollowNetty TPC example on wikipediaap  precodepackage nettyserver  import java.util.logging.Level import java.util.logging.Logger  import org.jboss.netty.channel.ChannelHandlerContext import org.jboss.netty.channel.ChannelStateEvent import org.jboss.netty.channel.ExceptionEvent import org.jboss.netty.channel.MessageEvent import org.jboss.netty.channel.SimpleChannelUpstreamHandler    Next up is our custom ChannelHandler. You can see that by the name this is an UpstreamHandler.   An UpstreamHandler can receive anything that the Server receives, additionally, an DownstreamHandler can   capture packets that the server is about to send. However depending on where in the hierarchy level the handler   is placed, it can be triggered in different states.         DSH1 gtABCDEgt DSH2 gtBCDgt DSH3 gtDCBgt[WEB]          Above are three DownstreamHandlers each one with a specific task.   The first DSH1 DownstreamHandler is the DelimiterBasedFrameDecoder that just output   a String ABCDE down the stream. The second DSH2 DownstreamHandler intercepts the output from the   previous DownstreamHandler and performs its specific logic on the input which in this case   is to remove the vowels. Now the third DSH3 DownstreamHandler will intercept the outgoing message   and it is assigned to reverse the order of the letters. When theres no DonstreamHandlers left in the   ChannelPipeline the output will be sent to the clientserver.     The same principle applies to UpstreamHandlers. If you want to combine the functionality   of the SimpleChannelDownstreamHandler and the SimpleChannelUpstreamHandler there is the class called   SimpleChannelHandler. The SimpleChannelHandler class implements both the Down and Upstream interfaces   which allows the handler to manage messages going both ways.     In this example, the SimpleChannelUpstreamHandler will be used.      public class MyMessageHandler extends SimpleChannelUpstreamHandler       private Logger logger  Logger.getLoggerMyMessageHandler.class.getSimpleName      Override     public void messageReceivedChannelHandlerContext ctx, MessageEvent e throws Exception           The messageReceived method is where all the messages that passes this UpstreamHandler           will be caught. Below we can use the class MessageEvents getMessage to retrieve           the message it has intercepted.          System.out.printlnServer  Received a new message saying   e.getMessage           We can also use the class MessageEvents getChannel to retrieve the Channel object           created by the ChannelFactory we instantiated in the Server class. We can then use the Channel           to perform a write operation on the pipeline This will go downstream from beginning of the           pipeline to the end.           It is important that you append a newline separator, n, if you want the ChannelBuffer to be           cleaned and forwarded from the FrameDelimiter. By appending the delimiter you send the           String to its target destination.          e.getChannel.writeHello, client Your IP is   e.getRemoteAddress  n                  We received your message saying   e.getMessage  n           We must not forget to call the super.messageReceived... for our superclass. If you do not do this,           the message will be stuck in the pipeline.          super.messageReceivedctx, e           Override     public void exceptionCaughtChannelHandlerContext ctx, ExceptionEvent e throws Exception           Override method for exceptions. Its good practice to Log the errors that occur in your           errors.          logger.logLevel.SEVERE, e.getCause.toString           We always call the method superclass.          super.exceptionCaughtctx, e           Override     public void channelConnectedChannelHandlerContext ctx, ChannelStateEvent e throws Exception          System.out.printlnServer    e.getChannel.getRemoteAddress   has connected          We can specifically handle new connections.           For example add the Channel to a ChannelGroup.            We always call the method superclass.          super.channelConnectedctx, e           Override     public void channelDisconnectedChannelHandlerContext ctx, ChannelStateEvent e throws Exception           We can also handle when a disconnection occur.           Here we could remove the Channel from abovementioned ChannelGroup.          System.out.printlnServer    e.getChannel.getRemoteAddress   has disconnected from the Server.          We always call the method superclass.          super.channelDisconnectedctx, e        codepre  pAdmittedly, this question made more sense when I first woke up, but now that Ive written it down...in for a penny.  p

Negative 80825 pI would like to know is this is possible. Create a sharedptr or uniqueptr of TestClass type.p  pThen call beginthreadex and pass it a static method of the class as the function to execute and the sharedptr or uniqueptr created before as data.

Something like thisp  precode    TestClass  p  new TestClasscount, test     HANDLE hth1  HANDLEbeginthreadexNULL, 0, pgtThreadStart,p, 0, NULL codepre  pWhat I want to achieve is to make the smart pointer to delete the object automatically when the thread ends because the smart pointer would be out of scope. p  pWhen I do it the way I am describing it above the compiler shows this errorp  pno suitable conversion function from stdsharedptr to void  existsp

Negative 80825 pIf I have a node.js application that has hundreds of files that reference a module say underscore and I want to replace that module with another say lodash then the obvious way to do this substitution would be a global name replace and switch out the modules in the package.json file.p  pIs there anyway to just change the module that a name refers to so that when node.js sees requiremoduleA it actually loads moduleB instead Now I know that this would cause naming hell because anyone working on the project would see requiremoduleA and wouldnt know that the real module being loaded was moduleB so ultimately youd probably want to go with the first solution. The use case that Im thinking of is if you want to try a few alternatives for API compatible modules to measure your applications performance for example with each module.p

My question is that I need a code in the program, besides the 1st restriction, that have also another one restriction under the first that will read the second line of the txt file with the numbers and check if there are as many numbers as the first line saysp  pHow do I do that If you guys want any other declarations feel free to ask Hope I was clear with my problem p

Negative 80825 pI am currently developing a media application for Android that can cast its media to a Google Chromecast.p  pThis application is not meant to be published so some of the unorthodox choices I have made web server, local files etc. isnt part of the discussion.p  pThe problem is that when I load a media stream to the Chromecast, or seek in the stream, it doesnt change. The callback says it succeeds, but the movie keeps playing from scratch when I load with initial position and doesnt change when I perform remoteMediaPlayer.seekXX.p  pThe movie that is playing locally is a file on the SD card. At the same time, the phone runs a Web server KWS and the chromecast is fed with this URL. This works perfecly otherwise  I can play, pause and change the movie playing. No problem there. But I do have the seek problem. p  pThe reason Im mentioning the web server is because when I run the URL a hrefhttpcommondatastorage.googleapis.comgtvvideosbucketsampleBigBuckBunny.mp4 relnofollowhttpcommondatastorage.googleapis.comgtvvideosbucketsampleBigBuckBunny.mp4a from googles samples, the seeking work.p  pCould anyone help me figure out what is different because I host the file myself I saw posts mentioning that if the stream doesnt have a duration, remoteMediaPlayer cannot seek in it. But it does. A call to remoteMediaPlayer.getStreamDuration returns the actual media duration.p  pThere seems to be something in missing in how I host the files...p  pAll help is appreciated.p

Negative 80825 pI am currently beginning my first real attempt at a DDDCQRSES system after studying a lot of material and examples.p  p1 I have seen event sourcing examples where the Aggregates are Event Handlers and their Handle method for each event is what mutates the state on the object instance They implement an IHandleEventltEventTypegt interface for events that would mutate the statep  p2 I have also seen examples where the Aggregates would just look like plain classic Entity classes modelling the domain. Another Event Handler class is involved in mutating the state.p  pState, of course, is mutated on an aggregate by the event handlers in both cases when rebuilding the aggregate from a repository call that gets all the previous events for that aggregate, and when a command handler calls methods on an aggregate. Although in the latter Ive seen examples where the events are published in the command handler rather than by the aggregate, which Im convinced is wrong.p  pMy question is what are the pros and cons between method 1 and 2p

To make it even stranger it seems to be based on the previous page.

Negative 80825 pI am currently using Hangfire to run some jobs in a windows service.  The jobs are fired from a WebAPI.p  pMy system is currently working fine when all jobs succeed, but I am getting no logging for when exceptions occur.

Negative 80825 pId like to use theano for defining a Neural Network Layer, but Id like to keep the memory management in between layers under my control.p  pFor this Id like to define a theano function that takes some shared inputs no copying and writes to a given output no copying. So basically like this simplified example but without the memory copyp  precodeimport theano, theano.tensor, numpy  define a function x  theano.tensor.fvectornamex g  theano.function[theano.Inx, borrowTrue], x2  set up the memory buffers inputbuffer  numpy.arange3, dtypenumpy.float32 outputbuffer  numpy.zeros3, dtypenumpy.float32  this should happen write the output of the function to the outputbuffer outputbuffer[]  finputbuffer  but ideally without copying like this maybe finputbuffer, outputbuffer codepre  pI am aware of codetheano.Outcode, and I was able to do thisp  precodeg  theano.function[theano.Inx, borrowTrue], theano.Outx2, borrowTrue outputbuffer  ginputbuffer  printoutputbuffer   gt [0, 1, 4] outputbuffer[]  0 printoutputbuffer   gt [0, 0, 0] foo  ginputbuffer printoutputbuffer   gt [0, 1, 4] codepre  pWhich is almost what I want, except that I can not provide the memory for the codeoutputbuffercode.p  pI also played around with codeupdatescode in the function definition, but they only work for shared variables, which means I would have to recompile the function every time I want to specify a different output buffer.p  pThere is an codeupdatecode keyword argument to codetheano.Incode which sounded like what I need, but it doesnt seem to work as Id expectp  precodez  theano.tensor.fvectornamez y  x2 h  theano.function[x, theano.Inz, updatey, borrowTrue] inputbuffer  numpy.arange3, dtypenumpy.float32 outputbuffer  numpy.zeros3, dtypenumpy.float32 hinputbuffer, outputbuffer printoutputbuffer   gt [0, 0, 0] but was expecting [0, 1, 4] codepre  pIs what I want even possible in theano right now, or do I need to do the copying. On the CPU it might not be too bad, but if using a GPU I dont want to copy the output to host memory and back.p

Negative 80825 pWebAPI supports OData, so API consumer can specify fields that he requires, and it works fine. But is there a way to use DTO objects and projections in WebAPIp  pFor example I havep  precodepublic class WebSite      public string Url getset     public string Author getset     public string Technology getset     public DateTime CreatedAt getset      20 more different properties  codepre  pAnd i also have DTO objectp  precodepublic class WebSiteDTO      public string Url getset     public string Author getset      public bool IsDotNet getset  it should be set during mapping as webSite.Technology  .Net     public bool IsTrendThing getset  should be set as  webSite.Technology  .Net and webSite.CreatedAt gt new DateTime2014,0,0  codepre  pAnd some typical WebAPI endpoint that supports ODatap  precode[HttpGet] [RouteTest] public IQueryable TestODataQueryOptionsltWebSiteDTOgt options      var efDbContext  new MyDBContext     var query  efDbContext.WebSites     var odataQuery  options.ApplyToquery, settings     return odataQuery  codepre  pIn that case WebSite object will be returned. But how to return WebSiteDTO object and still have OData support Is it possible to do mapping by property and not by class itself Like if Url was requested via OData, then we will load just Url from DB and map it to Url property in DTO object I may have complicated cases when properties in DTO must be set by some custom logic like in IsDotNet sample, or it may depend on more than one property.p  pI suppose i can write some custom middleware that will execute original query with fields specified by OData, and then save it in Dictionary and then do something like thatp  precodeMyMapper.MapltWebSite, WebSiteDTOgt.     MapPropertyo, dict gt o.Url  stringdict[Url].     MapPropertyo, dict gt o.IsDotNet  stringdict[Technology]  .Net.     MapPropertyo, dict gt o.IsTrendThing  stringdict[Technology]  .Net ampamp DateTimedict[CreatedAt] gt new DateTime2014,0,0 codepre  pBut it looks ugly and in that case somehow i need to specify that if IsTrendThing property was requested in OData request, then I also need to load Technology and CreatedAt fields from WebSite object, that makes things complicated. p  pIs there something that can be usefull in my case Maybe someone can help me with correct directionp  pAutomapper a hrefhttpsgithub.comAutoMapperAutoMapperwikiProjection relnofollowhas projections mappinga but it doesnt work in my scenario, as it requires specific type, and in my case original type can be different because of fields specified by OData.p  pThere is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16962081aspnetwebapiodatasupportfordtosanother similar questiona but it was about pure DTO, and in my case i want to support selectexpand operators from OData as my objects can have a lot of properties. And i want to not load them from DB if they werent requested.p

Negative 80825 pI want to preface this by saying that I am a beginner to asp.net, especially when it comes to working with the codeFormViewcode controls. I have searched long and hard and have spent hours debugging this issue. p  pI have 3 codeFormViewscode on one aspx page. Each codeFormViewcode has its own codeEditItemTemplatecode and codePagerTemplatecode with codeDefaultModeEditcode. I am not using a codeSqlDataSourcecode, but instead databinding programatically on the codePageLoadcode when codeifPage.IsPostBackcode and also calling the databinding method when the codePageIndexChangingcode method is called. The pager template contains a Back and a Next button set with codeCommandArgumentPrevcode and codeCommandArgumentNextcode, respectively, and both set with codeCommandNamePagecode. p  pThe paging works great on the first codeFormViewcode. When I hit the back or next button, it pages i.e. rebinds appropriately. During the 1st codeFormViewcodes paging event, I also successfully call the binding methods for the 2nd and 3rd codeFormViewcode since I want them to bind data that is specific to the page selected in the 1st codeFormViewcode. p  pBut, when I page back to the first page of the 1st codeFormViewcode i.e. codePageIndex  0code, and then try to page forward in the 2nd codeFormViewcode, the datakey for the 1st codeFormViewcode is null. In fact, the codeformview1.DataSourcecode is null for the 1st codeFormViewcode when I try to click a navigation button on the 2nd codeFormViewcode. p  pThen, heres where I thought it was weird, ... if I click back a second time on the 1st codeFormViewcode, THEN the codeformview1.DataSourcecode is fine, and I can then navigate in the 2nd codeFormViewcode. p  pAll viewstates for the formviews and the buttons are set to true.  I have tried calling codeformview1.DataBindcode inside codeformview2codes paging event before any paging occurs but no success there. I have also tried setting properties codeUseSubmitBehaviorFalsecode and codeCausesValidationFalsecode on the paging buttons. Admittedly, I did this without really understanding the behavior but rather implemented after seeing it suggested in solutions for other somewhat related problems. p  pThe templates are rather long since there are many fields in each. But the codeFormViewcode tags look like this            p  precodeltaspFormView IDfvHeader runatserver DataKeyNamesObjectID DefaultModeEdit AllowPagingTrue OnModeChangingfvHeaderModeChanging OnPageIndexChanging fvHeaderPageIndexChanginggt  ltEditItemTemplategt ..... ltEditItemTemplategt ltaspFormViewgt codepre  pPagerTemplatesp  precode       ltPagerSettings ModeNextPrevious gt        ltPagerTemplategt            ltspan classlabelsgtPage ltfvHeader.PageIndex1gt of ltfvHeader.PageCount gtltspangtampnbsp            ltaspButton IDbtnBack runatserver CommandArgumentPrev CommandNamePage CssClassbtnHdr Textampltamplt Back gtampnbsp            ltaspButton IDbtnNext runatserver CommandArgumentNext CommandNamePage CssClassbtnHdr TextNext ampgtampgt gtampnbspltPagerTemplategt codepre  pNote that codefvHeadercode is what Im calling codeformview1code for simplicity in my question. p  pBackNext buttons C code and databinding the 1st formviewp  precode    protected void fvHeaderPageIndexChangingobject sender, FormViewPageEventArgs e                                  fvHeader.PageIndex  e.NewPageIndex                     bindFVInitial                       rebind fvSub1 2nd formview to get the 1st obs of the newly selected header record                     fvSub1.ChangeModeFormViewMode.Edit                     fvSub1.PageIndex  0                     bindSub1Initial  rebind 2nd subform                     fvSub2.ChangeModeFormViewMode.Edit                     fvSub2.PageIndex  0                     bindSub2Initial                     private void bindFVInitial                                  if conn.State  ConnectionState.Open                                              conn.Close                                           conn.Open                      if dtEOS  null  dtEOS.Rows.Count  0                                              sqlda  new SqlDataAdapterUSE dbWEF SELECT  FROM tblHeader WHERE [UserID]    Session[User]   AND [ProjectName]    Session[Project]  , conn                          sqlda.FilldtEOS                                           fvHeader.DataSource  dtEOS                     fvHeader.DataBind                      conn.Close                      if dtEOS.Rows.Count gt 0                                              fillDDfvHeader Fill dropdowns and databind ddls                                                     codepre  pBelow is the error message I receive when I attempt to navigate the 2nd formview. p  precode    Error in bindSub1Initial.

Negative 80825 pId like to have a GridView to show data of multiple tables in Yii2.  Just for an example, here is a simplified example of the database structurep  pTable1 Entryp  pTable2 Namep  pTable3 NameOfSomething nameid fk, entryid fkp  pTable4 Date entryid fkp  pTable5 Placep  pTable6 PlaceOfSomething placeid fk, entryid fkp  pTable7 PlaceOfSomethingElse placeid fk, entryid fkp  pSo lots of joins and also where clauses.p  pIf I use ActiveRecord with Kartik GridView, it makes queries row by row to join other tables and put where clauses together. I need to show at least 5001000 result rows without pagination. With this, even if one query takes milliseconds, it takes 10100 seconds to retrieve all the data I need to show.  I have an other solution with datatables.net, I have 1 big query and I give this to feed the table. It has 2030 times better perfomance, which would be enough. So the question, is there any way to feed the GridView in Yii2 with one big query instead of a lot of queries to improve performance  keeping the filter and the sorting features If yes, howp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pSo the real problem is with the tables joined on the second level like Place. It is still querying for each row.

Negative 80825 pIm making simple 2D game, I designed the way the player going through in the game. If the player touches the wall the game is over, so I must detect collisions.p  pAt first I created the walls from sprites, but then I realized there is no 2D collider that suit himself to the shape of the spritit was to difficult to create the collider manually from a lot of smaller polygon and circle colliders, so I made all the walls that builds the way 3D objects.dae files with z0.001, and added them the mash collider which suits himself to the 3D object. I changed my player to be 3D as well so the collisions types will match. It worked, but Im sure the same game can work by much better performance with the same resources if all the game objects were 2D.p  pHow can it be that there is a collider that suits himself to a 3D object but there is none for 2D Maybe I miss somethingp

Negative 80825 pBecause there is no language feature in C to protect assignment to global variables would you recommend doing something like thisp  pTake this examplep  blockquote   pWe have a module with the header file called codemodule.hcode and   implementation file codemodule.ccode.

Theyd enter this information into the account settings when setting up their cart.p  pOn the merchants side, it seems like this is easily possible, and says to do this to grant API access specifically to shopping carts htttpspaypal.comuscgibinwebscrcmdprofileapiaccess once logged in as a merchant.p  pI personally am using PHP to call CURL, though that probably is not important.

Negative 80825 pI have a mysql web app that allows users to edit personal information.p  pA single record is stored in the database across multiple tables.  There is a single row in one table for the record, and then additional onetomany tables for related information.  Rows in the onetomany tables can additionally point to other onetomanytables.p  pAll this is to say, data for a single personal information record is a tree that is very spread out in the database.p  pTo update a record, rather than trying to deal with a hodgepodge of update and delete and insert statements to address all the different information that may change from save to save, I simply delete the entire old tree, and then reinsert a new one. This is much simpler on the application side, and so far it has been working fine for me without any problems.p  pHowever I do note that some of the autoincrementing IDs in the onetomany tables are starting to creep higher.  It will still be decades at least before I am anywhere close to this bumping against the limits of INT, let alone BIGINT  however I am still wondering if there are any drawbacks to this approach that I should be aware of. p  pSo I guess my question is  For database structures like mine, which consist of large trees of information spread across multiple tables, when updating the information, any part of which may have changed, is it ok to just delete the old tree and reinsert a new one  Or should I be rethinking this.  IOW is it ok or not ok for there to be large gaps between the IDs of the rows in a tablep  pThanks in advance for your help.p

Negative 80825 pIm a little bit confused about the difference between passing an object and a primitive data as the parameter in Java. I read a a hrefhttpwww.javacoffeebreak.comfaqfaq0066.html relnofollowposta here explaining that when you pass a primitive data, you copy that data and pass it, but if you pass an object then you pass by the object reference.

Negative 80825 pThe situation I am uncertain of concerns the usage of a threadsafe PipeStream where multiple threads can add messages to be written. If there is no queue of messages to be written, the current thread will begin writing to the reading party. If there is a queue, and the queue grows while the pipe is writing, I want the thread that begun writing to deplete the queue.p  pI hope that this design demonstrated below discourages the continuous enteringreleasing of the SemaphoreSlim and decrease the number of tasks scheduled. I say hope because I should test whether this complication has any positive performance implications. However, before even testing this I should first understand if the code does what I think it will, so please consider the following class, and below it a sequence of eventsp  pNote I understand that execution of tasks is not tied to any particular thread, but I find this is the easiest way to explain.p  precodeclass SemaphoreExample       Wrapper around a NamedPipeClientStream     private readonly MessagePipeClient mpipe          new MessagePipeClientsomePipe      private readonly SemaphoreSlim msemaphore          new SemaphoreSlim1, 1      private readonly BlockingCollectionltMessagegt mmessages          new BlockingCollectionltMessagegtnew ConcurrentQueueltMessagegt      public Task SendltTgtT content         where T  class              if this.mmessages.TryAddnew MessageltTgtcontent             throw new InvalidOperationExceptionNo more requests          Task dequeue  TryDequeue          return Task.FromResulttrue          In reality this class and method is more complex.          There is a similiar pipe and wrkr in the other direction.          The sent jobs is kept in a dictionary and this method          returns a task belonging to a completionsource tied          to the sent job.

However, before creating the new thread, other callers of Send is given an opportunity to enter the semaphore, thereby possibly preventing the use of an additional thread.p  pTo not let any work be left lingering in the queue, any worker who successfully entered the semaphore and did some work must check if there is any new work added after exiting the semaphore. If this is true the same worker will try to reenter if maxWorkload is not reached or delegate work as described above.p  pExample below Send now sets up TryPool as a continuation of TryDequeue. TryPool only begins if TryDequeue returns true i.e. did some work while having entered the semaphore.p  precode     maxWorkload cannot be 1 for this method     private async Taskltboolgt TryDequeueint maxWorkload              int currWorkload  0         while this.mmessages.Count  0 ampamp this.msemaphore.Wait0                      try                              currWorkload  await DequeuecurrWorkload, maxWorkload                 if currWorkload gt maxWorkload                     return true                          finally                              this.msemaphore.Release                               return false           private Task TryPool              if this.mmessages.Count  0  this.msemaphore.Wait0             return Taskltboolgt.FromResultfalse          return Task.Runasync  gt                      do                              try                                      await Dequeue0, 1                                  finally                                      this.msemaphore.Release                                           while this.mmessages.Count  0 ampamp this.msemaphore.Wait0                    private async Taskltintgt Dequeueint currWorkload, int maxWorkload              while currWorkload lt maxWorkload  maxWorkload  1                      Message message             if this.mmessages.TryTakeout message                 return currWorkload              await this.mpipe.WriteAsyncmessage              currWorkload                  return maxWorkload      codepre

Negative 80825 pI have a POJO class that contains string fields and also a Map. I read the Joshua Bloch Effective Java fragment about cloning objects, but this case I think is not so trivial. I have a few POJOs, and I wanted to clone them using Copy Constructor approach, but I dont know how can I clone map which as value has an object p  pI know that this Object may be a simple immutable object, for example a String class, but sometimes it may be a completely different POJO, or even list or map. The onyl way which I think it may work is to do some checks in constructor using instanceof, but Its ugly I would have to do check for List, Map, and every POJO right.p  pMaybe I should change my approach to implement Cloneable interfacep  pI also saw a cloning method with serialization, but I think that this is also ugly solution, and its performance would be worst then for example when using Copy Constructor approach.p  pCan you give me an advise how should I clone my POJOsp

Negative 80825 pIm wondering if xCode auto layout  constraints are really as frustrating as I think, or am I just not understanding them.  For example, I started with this basic label in the view controllerp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com18BRH.png altinitialControllerp  pFair enough.  A box with text that has equal margins on the leftright and a smaller top margin.  Now when I run any size device, that gets skewedcut off from the device view.  So right away for some reason Xcode thinks that despite me putting the entire label in the view controller, it things it should display halfway off the screen.  Dont get it but okay, so I went ahead and added auto layout constraits to the right, left and top margins.  The result isp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFUiDX.png altwithMarginsp  pSo it centered it, which is nice, but now it just ignores the fact that I made the width larger and it just shrinks it down anyways  For something so simple this seems to be very...unreliable.  I then added the aspect ratio constraint and it seemed to look fine in all of the devices...finallyp  pI curiously also simply tried to get rid of all those, and simply add the aspect ratio constraint and the horizontal center in container constraint.  On the main storyboard preview not the simulator it looked like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comVt9MA.png altaspectAndHorizontalp  pNot what Im looking for, as its not stretched downward like I want, they shrunk it again.  However...when actually running it in the simulator...it looks perfect, the way I want it to in the first picture of the view controller.p  pWhy the preview and simulator differed, I suppose from reading other questions its because there were a few warnings after I added these.  One was that the horizontal and vertical positions are one initially and will be different at run time.  But when I ran it, it definitely held the initial ones and not the ones they said it would be at run time.  It also told me that vertical position was ambiguous...well yeah I only set a center and aspect ratio...pretty obvious and not sure how Id even solve that error.  It solves it when I delete the horizontal center...but now its not centered which is a step back from what I wanted.p  pLong story short, how do I deal with this.  My previews and simulations arent accurate with each other even for the simplest auto layout specifics.  Apps nowadays are so complicated and on every device they scale and work beautifully, and this seems to not agree with even just one label.p  pDoes anybody have any good articles, advice, or anything that would help me  This auto layout stuff seems to be so picky and thats really all I know so I have to deal with it.  And dont even get me started on why the text doesnt scale with the label...why would I want the text on an iphone 4 to be the same on an ipad even when my label is increasing in size with the devicep  pA lot to go through, but its just very frustrating and I cant see myself doing much else before I try to understand these basics.  Thank you and much appreciated.p

Negative 80825 pI have two cells that need to work together. Im trying to find some sort of hypothetical function I can use where the value of one cell reflects a numerical value based on the value of the other.  I.E., if A2 is the cell I change periodically manually type in the value and A2 has a value of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 or 8. B2s value changes to a predetermined value that is assigned to each number 18. B2s value is dependent of A2.

Negative 80825 pIve been doing some digging through old SO questions about the inherent evilness of mutable structs, but as a C noob I cant tell whether this is an intended use of structs in c.p  pSo basically Im learning c by making a simple textbased dungeon game. I have codeEnemycode, codePlayercode, and codeAttackcode classes and an codeEffectcode Struct. Every codeAttackcode can have an codeEffectcode, and when the codePlayercode object attacks an codeEnemycode object, it uses its own codeAttackcode object to calculate damage, and then passes the codeAttackcodes codeEffectcode struct to the codeEnemycode where it is added to a list of Effects.p  pEffect has a duration field, which is decreased every turn until it reaches 0 via this method p  precodepublic void tick          duration  codepre  pEvery turn, the codeEnemycode iterates through the list of codeEffectscode, calling codetickcode and checking whether codedurationcode has reached 0. If it has, it removes the struct from the list.p  pNow is this bad, or is it one of the intended uses of structs Coming from a java background, Im used to doing this by codenewcodeing objects. Is that the way its supposed to be done in cp

Negative 80825 pI have a Windows server that currently runs 2 different Tomcat instances as Windows services. Both have their own directories and dont share any files between them. The first Tomcat instance that was installed via the setup wizard set the CATALINAHOME and CATALINABASE environment variables. The second one was installed in the same manner. It ignores the global settings and runs as a selfcontained instance.p  pHeres the problem. I need to install a product which ships with its own Tomcat. I have finished installing the product but now I need to configure this Tomcat. When I run bintomcat7w.exe the GUI control window it picks up the settings from the first Tomcat that was installed on this machine.

Negative 80825 pSo here is my situation. I have data located in a SQL Server 2008 R2 versioned ESRI SDE database which I want to have autopopulate a unique ID for. I have found a script that works well on a single record insert it works also for multiple records which will pull the max ID from the tables and add one number to it for the insert. p  pThe problem I have run into is due to the way ESRI works for inserting records. When you create data in your mapping software ArcMap every time you hit save it acts as an insert on the table. So if you were to hit save after one record and the max ID is 27 the ID for the new recorddata would be 28. Take this case again but this time you created two features before hitting save, this inserts both records into the table at the same time and each record gets an ID of 28 instead of 28 and 29 respectively.p  pAll this being said, I have pasted the code I am using below which works on both the original dataset and the delta table created from it being versioned, but what I need help figuring out is how to use the max ID from the current dataset to populate the next record ID for each record inserted without duplicating it on a multiple record insert. This code is focused on a parcel id for a parcel boundary which in many cases I may have to split a parcel which would result in two features needing a unique ID.

The article seems to use a dedicated database with service broker enabled and says not to modify the database. p  pSo do I need to have a separate database for this I know Entity can be picky if the database schema doesnt match and I worry that if I try to use the SignalR Sql Server package with the existing database that the tables it creates will cause a context changed error.p  pAlso can someone provide me with more information about using the Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.SqlServer package. The article I linked doesnt give a ton of detail and I dont know if I need to change anything in my hub and groups or if it is all handled automatically. p

Negative 80825 pI have a ScheduledExecutorService SES that is setup to run a Runnable on a single thread every N seconds using scheduleAtFixedRate. My understanding of an SES is that given a runnable and a period , it will queue a runnable up and run that runnable from the queue every time the period elapses. p  pI am concerned about the shutdown behavior of the SES. If I call SES.shutdown I block any new runnables from being added to the queue and the SES will finish off any runnables in the queue. My question is, when running the SES with scheduleAtFixedRate will there always only be the next scheduled runnable in the queue or will the SES queue up more than just the next runnable I want to know if when I call shutdown on the SES if I will only need to wait for one more runnable to run or many more.p

But I am not sure I can do this the way SonarQube is aking me...p  pHeres my code p  precodefor Integer integer integerKey.keySet      if map.containsKeyintegerKey.getinteger          TypeValue value  map.getintegerKey.getinteger         sb.appendintegerKey.getinteger.append         sb.appendencodeValuevalue         sb.append         if integerKey.getinteger.equalsmin              break               else if integerKey.getinteger lt min         TypeValue value  map.getmin         sb.appendmin.append         sb.appendencodeValuevalue         sb.append         break      else          sb.appendintegerKey.getinteger.append         sb.append0         sb.append       codepre  pI would like to do the same thing but using only one codebreakcode but I am not sure I can write only one codeifcode condition in this case instead of codeifelseifelsecode.p  pAny ideas p  pThanks.p
Negative 80825 pIve stumbled onto yet another fatal Flash bug, which I barely nauseous enough to describe.p  pStoring things in array such as below is common. levelDataEdible is an array containing strings. You access it to find out a string based on the current level. This has worked until suddenly, without reason.p  precodestatic public var comboType14Array               [Bomb,             Constants.levelDataEdible[Constants.currentLevel],             Gem,             Constants.levelDataEdible[Constants.currentLevel],             Gem,             Constants.levelDataEdible[Constants.currentLevel],             Frog          ]  static public var levelDataEdibleArray  [ null, Fish, Golfball, Gloves, Logger, Burger, Beer, Snowshoes, Smore, Pontoon, Binocular] codepre  pYou have to dynamically create the variable.  Access it by strong[classname][match]strong. In this case strongScoreKeep[match]strongp  precodevar matchString  comboType  StringConstants.currentLevel codepre  pThen, whats new and changed, is that now the result is always for currentLevel  1. Even if currentLevel  5 or 7. p  pFlash does not evaluate variables inside of arrays based on their current state. I dont know what it does, but this works fine in dozens of other areas of the game. For some malicious reason, not here.p  pAmazingly, I cant even engineer a workaround. Ive tried putting a function in the array that returns the string for the currentLevel, and instead of the string it returns Function function or some nonsense. p  pI even tried converting the array into a vector, duplicating the array, copying the string values to another array, no matter WHAT I do, Flash figures out a way to stop me. Its really, truly something else. Inhuman, malicious. p
Negative 80825 pI have a web form with typefile input for file upload. However, if the user selects a shortcut in windows, it uploads the shortcut file instead of the actual file shortcut target.p  pIt is possible to detect that the user has selected shortcut  eg. by filename extension lnk. But how do I by javascript automatically upload the target file instead of the shortcutp
