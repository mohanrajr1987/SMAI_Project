Positive 1912 pIm having some trouble configuring Buildship for Eclipse the way I want. I currently have  50 projects always open in Eclipse, but I want to move to having only the projects I am actively working on in Eclipse, and the other projects would use a Maven repository to resolve their dependency.p  pLets say ProjectA which contains a main depends on ProjectB a library project. If ProjectB is opened in Eclipse, I would like ProjectA to use ProjectB directly. A change in the code in ProjectB would be noticeable when running ProjectA. However, if ProjectB is closed, I would like ProjectA to use the ProjectBs JAR located in the Maven repository mentioned in the build.gradle file.p  pThe behavior that I am talking about is detailed a hrefhttpsissuetracker.springsource.combrowseSTS2834focusedCommentId103757amppagecom.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanelscommenttabpanelcomment103757 relnofollowherea.p  pIs there a way to do that using Buildship Or should I use another Gradle Eclipse pluginp

Some of the possible causes 1. The EJB bean class was packaged in an ear lib library or through any other library mechanism which makes the library visible to all component modules, this makes all the component modules include this bean class indirectly. 2. The EJB bean class was packaged in a component module which references the EJB, either directly or indirectly through Manifest, WEBINFlib. The EJB bean class should only be packaged in the declaring ejb module and not the referencing modules. The referencing modules should only include EJB interfaces..

Positive 1912 pWe are in the process of upgrading our build processes and infrastructure. The majority of the projects are still stuck using Maven code2.2.1code we have hundreds of Maven projects across a number of environment on different Hudson and Jenkins servers. An immediate upgrade to 3.3.x will mostcertainly break things for us due to the number of teams affected and large amount of projects which havent been looked after, or have become obsolete.p  pAs part of the migration, we would temporarily like to disable the generation and deployment of Maven sites. In the more recent versions of the mavensiteplugin there is there are two properties that would have come quite handy  codemaven.site.skipcode and codemaven.site.deploy.skipcode, however we are unfortunately stuck Maven code2.2.1code where these versions are completely ignored.p  pIs there another way to disable thisp

Positive 1912 pI am implementing EAR with multiple WAR files, both war files uses same module but in one module we added more classes module1 of war1 and in another module we have added few classesmodule1 of war2. So i am adding all jars of both wars into EAR lib folder but the problem is while adding it module1 is always replacing with latest war which is running at last in dependency hierarchy of EAR pom.xml. I wants to make it in such a way that, it should keep existing class files of module1 and if any new classes found in other wars for same module module1 then it should append those classes. I am not finding exact info on it. If anyone already aware of it, please help p

Positive 1912 pI am having a very specific issue when trying to get a project deployed to Websphere that has multiple WARs packaged inside a single EAR. The first WAR is a SOAPbased web service while the second is a RESTbased service. Besides sharing a common build pom.xml neither of the two projects depend on each other.p  pThe problem I am running into is based on using the Jackson library in the REST service to handle JSON objects. For whatever reason the version of Jackson Websphere uses by default throws a codeNoSuchMethodcode error. This is apparently a common issue and switching the app to use a parentlast class loader solves it, afterwards the REST service works fine.p  pUnfortunately, the SOAP service does not work when using a parentlast class loader, throwing an error when trying to load one of the beans. Ive spent the last few days trying to get the two apps to play nice but havent succeeded yet.p  pAn ideal solution to the problem would be to get the REST service in general, and Jackson in particular, to work with a parentfirst class loader. A less ideal solution would be altering the SOAP service to work with a parentlast loader. Untenable solutions include splitting the apps into separate packages, or using something other than Jackson to handle the JSON objects.p  pDue to constraints at my company, I can only use versions of Jackson from 1.9.13 and below currently using 1.9.9, and Websphere Application Server v 8.0.0.8p

However, I have drop privileges. I am really confused and I cant seem to find a solution that works for me.p  pThanks to you in advance.p  pSOLUTIONp  pAs Steve mentioned below, Oracle security model is weird in that it needs to know explicitly somewhere in the procedure what kind of privileges to use. The way to let Oracle know that is to use AUTHID keyword in the CREATE OR REPLACE statement. If you want the same level of privileges as the creator of the procedure, you use AUTHID DEFINER. If you want Oracle to use the privileges of the user currently running the stored procedure, you want to use AUTHID CURRENTUSER. The procedure declaration looks as followsp  precodeCREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE uspdropTableschema VARCHAR, tblToDrop VARCHAR  AUTHID CURRENTUSER IS BEGIN   DECLARE vcnt NUMBER   BEGIN     SELECT COUNT        INTO vcnt        FROM alltables       WHERE owner  schema        AND tablename  tblToDrop       IF vcnt gt 0 THEN          EXECUTE IMMEDIATEDROP TABLE someschema.sometable PURGE      END IF    END END codepre  pThank you everyone for responding. This was definitely very annoying problem to get to the solution.p
Negative 1912 pIve inherited a piece of code that makes intensive use of String  byte[] conversions and vice versa for some homegrown serialisation code. Essentially the Java objects know how to convert their constituent parts into Strings which then get converted into a byte[]. Said byte array is then passed through JNI into C code that reconstitutes the byte[] into C stdstrings and uses those to bootstrap C objects which mirror the Java objects. There is a little more to it but this is a high level view of how this piece of code works The communication works like this in both directions such that the C  Java transition is a mirror image of the Java  C transition I mentioned above.p  pOne part of this code  the actual conversion of a String into a byte[]  is unexpectedly showing up in the profiler as burning a lot of CPU. Granted, there is a lot of data that is being transferred but this is an unexpected bottleneck.p  pThe basic outline of the code is as followsp  precodepublic void convertToByteArrayString convertme, ByteArrayOutputStream stream    stream.writeconvertme.getBytes  codepre  pThere is a little more to the function but not much. The above function gets called once for every StringStringified object and after all of the constituents are written to the ByteArrayOutputStream, the ByteArrayOutputStream gets converted into a byte[]. Breaking the above down into a more profilerfriendly version by extracting the codeconvertme.getBytescode call shows that over 90 of the time in this function is spent in the getBytes call.p  pIs there a way to improve upon the performance of the getBytes call or is there another, potentially faster way to achieve the same conversionp  pThe number of objects that are being converted is quite large. On the profiling runs which are using only a small subset of the production data, Im seeing something like 10 million plus calls to the above conversion function.p  pDue to the fact that were very close to releasing the project into production, there are a few workarounds that arent possible at this point in timep  ul liRewrite the serialisation interface to just pass String objects across the JNI layer. This is the obvious to me way of improving the situation but it would require major reengineering of the serialisation layer. Given the fact that were going into UAT early this week, its far too late to make this sort of complex change. It is my top todo for the next release so it will be done I however do need a workaround until then, but so far the code is working, has been used for years and has most of the kinks worked out. Well, aside from the performance.li liChanging the the JVM currently 1.5 is also not an option. Unfortunately this is the default JVM that is installed on the clients machines and updating to 1.6 which might or might not be faster in this case is unfortunately not possible. Anybody who has worked in large organisations probably understands why...li liIn addition to this, were already running into memory constraints so attempting to cache at least the larger Strings and their byte array representation, while being a potentially elegant solution, is likely to cause more problems than it will solveli ul

Negative 1912 pI have a plugin written entirely in Python using PyObjC whose core classes I need to convert to ObjectiveC.  One of them basically just loads up a Python module and executes a specific function, passing it keyword arguments.  In PyObjC, this was extremely.p  pHowever, Im having difficulty figuring out how to do the same thing using the Python C API.  In particular, Im unsure how best to convert an NSDictionary which might hold integers, strings, booleans, or all of the above into a format that I can then pass on to Python as keyword arguments.p  pAnyone have pointers on how to accomplish something like this  Thanks in advancep  pstrongEditstrong just to clarify, Im converting my existing class which was formerly Python into ObjectiveC, and am having trouble figuring out how to move from an NSDictionary in ObjectiveC to a Python dictionary I can pass on when I invoke the remaining Python scripts.

I have expanded a lot of operations into explicit steps to facilitate debugging, e.g. to be able to identify any implicit transforms of string payloads that may be occuring under the hood in Delphi 2009.p  pEven in this untidy expanded form this code compiles and works perfectly well in Delphi 7, but if I compile and run with Delphi 2009 I get no announcement of my service.p  pFor example, if I run this code as part of a Delphi 7 application to register a codedaap.tcpcode service an iTunes shared library I see it popup in a running instance of iTunes.  If I recompile the exact same application without modification in Delphi 2009 and run it, I do strongemnotemstrong see my service appearing in iTunes.p  pI get the same behaviour when monitoring with the strongdnssdstrong command line utility.  That is, service code compiled with Delphi 7 behaves as I expect, compiled in Delphi 2009  nothing.p  pI am not getting strongemanyemstrong errors from the Bonjour API  the strongDNSServiceRegisterReplystrong callback is being called with an ErrorCode of 0 zero, i.e. success, and if I supply a NIL name parameter with AutoRename specified in the flags then my service is allocated the correct default name.  But still the service does not show up in iTunes.p  pI am at a loss as to what is going on.p  pAs you might be able to tell from the expansion of the code, I have been chasing potential errors being introduced by the Unicode implementation in Delphi 2009, but this seems to be leading me nowhere.p  pThe code was originally developed against version 1.0.3 of the Bonjour APISDK.  Ive since updated to 1.0.6 in case that was somehow involved, without any success.  afaict 1.0.6 merely added a new function for obtaining properties, which currently supports only a DaemonVersion property for obtaining the Bonjour version  this is working perfectly.p  pemstrongNOTEstrong Im aware that the code as it stands is not technically UTF8safe in Delphi 7  I have eliminated explicit conversions as far as possible so as to keep things as simple as possible for the automatic conversions that Delphi 2009 applies.  My aim now is to get this working in Delphi 2009 then work backward from that solution to hopefully find a compatible approach for earlier versions of Delphi.emp  pstrongNOTE ALSOstrong I originally also had problems with browsing for advertised services, i.e. identifying an actual iTunes shared library on the network.  Those issues were caused by the Unicode handling in Delphi 2009 and have been resolved.  My Delphi 2009 code is just as capable of identifying an actual iTunes shared library and querying its TXT records.

Negative 1912 pGreat site I have a question I havent seen answered. p  pI am very new to this, I didnt know what JSON was yesterday, so I apologize if this is a stupid question. A client has requested an JSONXML type scheme to store data because they want a flat file to editupdate without having to deal with queries, and they want it flexible for future development.  I would like the data to be structured, as Ill use it and php to build html pages, two parts of the site will use it, both on the same server. p  pThe json file will contain an array of objects, probably eventually 50, that consist of  5 or 6 short tagdata combos, and 13 tagdata combos that will be long, a couple paragraphs of text each. p  pDetails server side implementation only, everything will reside on the same server. At this time, I will manually build the json file, in the future it may be automatically generated. I prefer json to xml as it seems to be easier to manipulate with php. I have php 5.2.6 and json 1.2.1.p  pMy questions arep  ol lipIs it appropriate to use json for data thats textarea size Will it cause performance issues at buildout when I have 3050 objects in my array, and I need to find the right onepli lipIs it appropriate to use json as a data repository like this pli lipIf so, Im having trouble finding instructions on the very basics, like how to access the file.

Negative 1912 pThe obvious answer is to use codeCharset.defaultCharsetcode but we recently found out that this might not be the right answer. I was told that the result is different from real default charset used by java.io classes in several occasions. Looks like Java keeps 2 sets of default charset.

We all know that doesnt work. However, this apparently throws off defaultCharset but it doesnt affect the real default charset used by OutputStreamWriter.p  pIs this a bug or featurep  pEDIT The accepted answer shows the root cause of the issue. Basically, you cant trust defaultCharset in Java 5, which is not the default encoding used by IO classes. Looks like Java 6 corrects this issue.p

Negative 1912 pI see a lot of RAII example classes wrapping around file handles.p  pI have tried to adapt these examples without luck to a character pointer.p  pA library that I am using has functions that take the address of a character pointer declared like getmeastringchar x. These functions allocate memory for that character pointer and leave it up to the end user of the library to clean it up in their own code.p  pSo, I have code that looks like this...p  precodechar a  NULL char b  NULL char c  NULL  getmeastringampa ifa  NULL     return    getmeabeerampb ifb  NULL     ifa  NULL         freea          return    getmesomethingampc ifc  NULL     ifa  NULL         freea          ifb  NULL         freeb          return   ifa  NULL     freea  ifb  NULL     freeb  ifa  NULL     freeb  codepre  pIt sounds like RAII is the answer for this mess that I have above.

Negative 1912 pIm writing a program that for performance reasons uses shared memory sockets and pipes as alternatives have been evaluated, and they are not fast enough for my task, generally speaking any IPC method that involves copies is too slow. In the shared memory region I am writing many structs of a fixed size. There is one program responsible for writing the structs into shared memory, and many clients that read from it. However, there is one member of each struct that clients need to write to a reference count, which they will update atomically. All of the other members should be read only to the clients.p  pBecause clients need to change that one member, they cant map the shared memory region as read only. But they shouldnt be tinkering with the other members either, and since these programs are written in C, memory corruption is possible. Ideally, it should be as difficult as possible for one client to crash another. Im only worried about buggy clients, not malicious ones, so imperfect solutions are allowed.p  pI can try to stop clients from overwriting by declaring the members in the header they use as const, but that wont prevent memory corruption buffer overflows, bad casts, etc. from overwriting. I can insert a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBufferoverflowprotectionCanaries relnofollowcanariesa, but then I have to constantly pay the cost of checking them.p  pInstead of storing the reference count member directly, I could store a pointer to the actual data in a separate mapped write only page, while keeping the structs in read only mapped pages. This will work, the OS will force my application to crash if I try to write to the pointed to data, but indirect storage can be undesirable when trying to write a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiLockfree relnofollowlock free algorithmsa, because needing to follow another level of indirection can change whether something can be done atomically.p  pIs there any way to mark smaller areas of memory such that writing them will cause your app to blow up Some platforms have hardware watchpoints, and maybe I could activate one of those with inline assembly,  but Id be limited to only 4 at a time on 32bit x86 and each one could only cover part of the struct because theyre limited to 4 bytes. Itd also make my program painful to debug p  pEdit I found a hrefhttpciteseerx.ist.psu.eduviewdocdownloaddoi10.1.1.95.9911ampreprep1amptypepdf relnofollowthis rather eye popping papera, but unfortunately it requires using ECC memory and a modified Linux kernel.p

I will place this in the ModelGroupsUsersMapper class.p  pAn enhancement would be to add a getGroups method to the ModelUser domain object which lazily loads the groups when needed by calling the appropriate method in the data mapper, which begs for the second question. Should I allow the domain object know about the data mapperp

Negative 1912 pWhat is the best way to generate soap xml in c  I prefer to use xmlserialization if possible.  Also, I need to add some custom attributes to the soap header, so not sure if this complicates things.p  pOne more note  Im connecting to a soap server on a linux server over TCP  the soap server was built in C. p  pAlso, the soap server does not respond to wsdl requests  its fully locked down.

Negative 1912 pI developed a website on ASP.NET 3.5 SP1 platform. And additional I have 2 win services. My task is to build install package. I decided that Visual Studio install projects are not met my requirements. I design my own installer for this project, because I need to resolve many question and problem in install process. My problem I need to deploy website into IIS, but I dont know how to do it easy. I found Microsoft tool as Web Deployment Tool, but I didnt find   any documentation. And must I include this tool into my installer for deployment at destination customer Another side I found SDC Tasks Library and it looks like a solution for me. But I saw many topics where people had problems and because the project was dead anybody couldnt help them. I know it is a long story... My question how can I deploy the website from another program I know that IIS versions have some differences and it is another headache, set a virtual directory, application pool very important, a type of authentification and so forth  Thanks.p

I want to be able to view who their advisor was for a certain quarter such as 2009 Winter and who they had requested.p  pThe result will be a table like thisp  precodeYear  Term    SID        Current  Requested  2009  Winter  860123456  1        NULL 2009  Winter  860445566  3        NULL 2009  Winter  860369147  5        1 codepre  pAnd then if I feel like it, I could also go ahead and view a different year and a different term. p  pI am not sure how these new tables will look like.

Negative 1912 pEverybody who used PInvoke of Windows API knows a long list of declarations of static functions with attributes likep  precode [DllImport kernel32.dll, SetLastError  true, CharSet  CharSet.Auto] codepre  pThe declaration of structures copied from Windows headers like WinNT.h or from web sites like www.pinvoke.net take also a lot of place in our programs.p  pWhy we all have to spend our time for this Why Microsoft not give us a simple way to include a line like in old unmanaged programsp  precodeinclude ltwindows.hgt codepre  pand we would be have access to a static class codeNativecode with all or the most Windows functions and structures insidep  pstrongUPDATEDstrong based on some answersp  pIt you will be honest with yourself, which part of your .NET programs are running not under Windows 5 1 If you use strongWMIstrong, strongProcessstrong, strongRegistrystrong or strongServiceProcess.ServiceBasestrong classes etc. in .NET is your program so emplatform independentem and more emcompatibleem if you not use native API Has codeThread.ApartmentStatecode everywhere sense out of Windowsp  pUsage of codeSafeHandlecode or codetry  finallycode is of cause required. I would be happy to have a standard definition of Native API in any of these forms.p  pI know that some structures in codewindows.hcode have different versions 3264 or XPVista etc. I think it would be enough to have also different version of Native structures like codeMIBIPADDRROWXPcode and codeMIBIPADDRROWW2Kcode or codeIMAGENTHEADERS32code and codeIMAGENTHEADERS64code see the same names in windows headers.p  pOne should of cause use managed .NET classes and methods if there are exist. Its a pity, but the implementation of some the most powerful features of Windows come in managed .NET too late and a lot of there are accessed till now only in unmanaged world. 10 year ago at one of the first Microsoft conference about .NET I asked about my favor strongMemory Mapped Filesstrong. Only .NET 4 has now codeMemoryMappedFilecode class implemented see a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comsalvapatuelarchive20090608workingwithmemorymappedfilesinnet4.aspxhttpblogs.msdn.comsalvapatuelarchive20090608workingwithmemorymappedfilesinnet4.aspxa. The same problems exist permanently if one writes utilities for administrative purpose. For example, opening file with codeCreateFilecode and Flag codeFILEFLAGBACKUPSEMANTICScode or codeRegCreateKeyExcode with codeREGOPTIONBACKUPRESTOREcode or codeREGOPTIONCREATELINKcode. strongHard Linksstrong and strongJunctionsstrong see a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa365006vVS.85.aspxhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryaa365006vVS.85.aspxa are next examples.

If you want to start a process and wait not till this process, but also untill all its child processes be ended, job is very useful. One can use codeCreateJobObjectcode and codeAssignProcessToJobObjectcode and then use codeTerminateJobObjectcode or codeWaitHandlecode like .NET version of codeWaitForSingleObjectcode.p  pOnly in .NET 4.0 codeSystem.IntPtrcode und codeSystem.UIntPtrcode classes supports codeAddcode and codeSubtractcode methods.p  pI can continue the examples, but I hope you understand what I mean. So strongI want to write a program in .NET because of a lot of advantages but I can do this not always without usage of native APIstrong. Moreover, there are sometimes customers requirement to the language of software implementation and I choose the required way.p  pstrongUPDATED 2strong Microsoft improved the interoperability with COM in .NET 4.0, but not with Clike Windows API. I see some ways to makes working with PInvoke easier. What way to do this you see I suggest three directions which I seep  ol liOne makes an assembly with declaration of all or the most important not yet fully implemented in .NET Windows API. This assemble can has only or almost only metadata of static Native class with static functions and corresponding classes  structures. This assembly can be placed in GAC and everybody could use it. This way I tested. It works very well.li liOne implements a collection of snippets with declaration and samples of using of different native Windows API.li liOne start an open source project on www.codeplex.com where one create .NET classes and extension methods  to some most important native Windows API which are not yet implemented in .NET.li ol  pI am sure that exist more ways to make easier for developer the usage of native Windows API. Other suggestions are welcome.p

Negative 1912 pI think I understand well enough what the BindingSource class does  i.e. provide a layer of indirection between a data source and a UI control. It implements the IBindingList interface and therefore also provides support for sorting. And Ive used it frequently enough, without too many problems. But Im wondering if I use it more often than I should. Perhaps an example would help.p  pLets say I have just a simple textbox on a form using WinForms, and Id like to bind that textbox to a simple property inside a class that returns a string. Is it worth using a BindingSource in this situationp  pNow lets say I have a grid on my form, and Id like to bind it to a DataTable. Should I use a BindingSource nowp  pIn the latter case, I probably would bnotb use a BindingSource, as a DataTable, from what I can gather, provides the same functionality that the BindingSource itself would. The DataTable will fire the the right events when a row is added, deleted, etc so that the grid will automatically update.p  pBut in the first case with the textbox being bound to a string, I would probably have the class that contains the string property implement INotifyPropertyChanged, so that it could fire the PropertyChanged event when the string changes. I would use a BindingSource so that it could listen to these PropertyChanged events so that it could update the textbox automatically when the string changes.p  pHow does this sound so far I still feel like theres a gap in my understanding thats preventing me from seeing the whole picture. This has been a pretty vague question so far, so Ill try to ask some more specific questions  ideally the answers will reference the above examples or something similar...p  p1 Is it worth using a BindingSource in either of the above examplesp  p2 It seems that developers just assume that the DataTable class will do the right thing, in firing PropertyChanged events at the right time. How does one know if a data source is capable of doing this Is there a particular interface that a data source should implement in order for developers to be able to assume this behaviourp  p3 Does it matter what Control is being bound to, when considering whether or not to use a BindingSource Or is it only the data source that should affect the decision Perhaps the answer is and this would seem logical enough the Control needs to be intelligent enough to listen to the PropertyChanged events, otherwise a BindingSource is required. So how does one tell if the Control is capable of doing this Again, is there a particular interface that developers can look for that the Control must implementp  pIt is this confusion that has, in the past, led to me emalwaysem using a BindingSource. But Id like to understand better exactly when to use one, so that I do so only when necessary.p

Negative 1912 pI have a scenario in which i receive files from a source and i blindly dump the data in the files to a staging area DB into number of tables.

Negative 1912 pstrongThere are two tables table A and table B. They have the same columns and the data is practically identicalstrong. They both have autoincremented IDs, the only difference between the two is that they have different IDs for the same records.p  pstrongAmong the columns, there is an IDENTIFIER column which is not uniquestrong, i.e. there are very few records with the same IDENTIFIER in both tables.p  pNow, in order to find a correspondence between the IDs of table A and the IDs of table B, strongI have to join these two tablesstrong for all purposes its a selfjoin on the IDENTIFIER column, something likep  precodeSELECT A.ID, B.ID FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.IDENTIFIER  B.IDENTIFIER codepre  pstrongBut, being IDENTIFIER nonunique, this generates every possible combination of the repeating values of IDENTIFIER, I dont want that.strongp  pIdeally, I would like to stronggenerate an one to one association between IDs that have repeating IDENTIFIER valuesstrong, based on their order.

Negative 1912 pWhat are some of the better solutions to handling large datasets 100K on the client with JavaScript. In particular, if you have multicolumn sort and search capabilities, how do you handle fetching and prefetching the data, client side model binding for display, and caching the data.p  pI would imagine a good solution would be doing some thoughtful work in the background. For instance, initially, if the table was displaying N items, it might fetch 2N items, return the data for the user, and then go fetch the next 2N items in the background even if the user hasnt requested this. As the user made searchsort changes, it would throw out or maybe even cache the initial base case, and do similar functionality.p  pCan you share the best solutions you have seenp  pThanksp

If, while the UI thread is iterating, Thread2 tries adding items to codeLinkListcode, an exception is thrown on the UI thread because you cant add an item to a list while iterating.p  pI dont want to have to wait until all threads return to bind the ListBox since that means the user has to wait a long time.

Negative 1912 pWe currently have our Git repositories on the local disk. They are shared by groups and accessed over SSH with gitshell.p  pBecause of space issues, we now want to move the repositories to an NFS share on a NAS. Ive been experimenting with this, and have run into a weird issue. A fresh and bare repository with exactly the same permissions can be cloned fine, but pushing changes touch foo ampamp git add foo ampamp git commit ampamp git push origin master fails with the error Couldnt set refsheadsmaster and failed to write.p  pNow, if I repeat this scenario on the local disk, refsheadsmaster becomes owned by whatever user pushed. Conversely, on the NFS share, if I change its owner to the user who is trying to push, no error is thrown. However, in both cases, the user is a member of a the group that owns the entire repository and has group write permission. Additionally, if I just log in using SSH as a user who is a member of this group, I can touch refsheadsmaster as is to be expected, both on the NFS share and the local disk.p  pConsequently, I am at a loss here. I have no idea why a different file owner would cause the push to fail, seeing as how the group permissions allow the user to overwrite refsheadsmaster. Moreover, even with a chmod 777 on that file, the push fails unless I chown the file.p  pIf anyone can shed some light on this weirdness, Ill be most grateful. Thanks in advancep

Negative 1912 pHere is my dilemma,p  pI am working on some SaaS using ASP.net MVC3 and SQL Server.p  pthere will be multiple companies that user the software, each company will have multiple users. to make sure the data doesnt accidentally become visible from one company to another I have setup the databases as individual databases for each company and then the webservers handle everything else UI, logic etc. p  pI can foresee an issue already and I need to decide how best to deal with it before it becomes a real issue. Having these multiple databases, if everything goes good this year emknock on woodem we could potentially get 500 clients by the end of the year. Manually syncing schemas is out of the question for obvious reasons. VS2010 has a nice SQL compare script tool that will be helpful but how should I go about making sure that all the databases are of the latest versionp  pProblem 2p  pthe way the system is designed it is very modular, so the clients will be able to add little widgets and things for their particular needs which will add new tables to there specific database. so in theory each database will be a little bit different. I figure the best way to handle this is to chuck all change scripts so that you have p  precodeCore.sql  WidgetMap.sql  WidgetHR.sql   etc..  codepre  pam I correct in this line of thinking or is there perhaps a more practical way to attack this situationp  pI have looked into RedGate SQL compare and I like it but, it still doesnt help in the multiple database situation.p  pso that being the case should I just create my own tools for updating the schemasp  pif so any advice, tips, links. to make this task a little less daunting would be very appreciated. p  pThank you very much for any and all assistance,p  pChase Q.

What I am trying to do is this p  pThe software is started and its added as a startup process in the registry however this should be done only when the application is closing  not before. p  pHowever this doesnt work in xp when the user is limited and same thing in vista,7,2008. p  pWhat are the workarounds I was thinking to make the program create a scheduled task or being attached to a process with higher privilleges Any working way I am taggin this as .net since my software is .net related  actually same thing happens and in c  but i secretly hope that net offers easier methods to work it out.  10x in advance p

Negative 1912 pI recently experienced that Selenium1 works very good with Firefox using XPath but its very very slow with IE. Is there any solution to increase performance in IE of Selenium1 p  pIve found out that people use JQuery elementlocators in Selenium.

Are they more flexible or fast, lets say in IE p  pActually Problem is with IE only while using Selenium1, So I am thinking to use JQuery locators instead of XPath but i dont know whether using JQuery locator would be as easy to use as XPath  p  pIs there any plugin by which I can get JQuery locator like XPather   Is there any way to convert existing XPath into JQuery locator  p  pBecause i have around thounsands of test already implemented amp running fine with Firefox Selenium1 now need to make all of them running fine with IE Selenium1. I am desperately looking for solution.p  pAny suggestion for issue. I am desperately looking for solution.p  pThank you.p
Negative 1912 pI have a very bizarre problem with a Spring 3.5, Webflow 2.2 application, running in Tomcat 6.0.32p  pPart of the webflow calls  to retrieve a list of objects. This list is placed in a viewScope object for use by a JSP view. Each object in this list inherits from a base class that contains some common fields.p  pThe webflow then forwards to a JSP view that displays the contents of this list, by writing out all the objects.p  pWhen I run this from a standalone Tomcat, the fields on the base class are all somehow set to null. I have debugged and confirmed the list is built correctly from the code called by the webflow . So somewhere between putting the list into the webflow view scope, and then it later being retrieved by the JSP, the base class fields are being reset to null.p  pThe REALLY bizarre part of the problem is that the app runs perfectly if I start and run Tomcat from within Intellij IDEA. Ive tried various JDKs and Tomcat versions, and all have the same issue. p  pIt appears to be a webflow problem improper serialization maybe thats sensitive to whether Tomcat has been started from within IntelliJ.p  pWhat is IntelliJ doing that could cause Java serialization to misbehave p

Negative 1912 pI am writing a linux wireless network scanner that provides information about access points, but it also must check if an access point is connected and can be communicated i.e. encryption works properly. It is not enough to check it by codeioctl.., SIOCGIWAP, ..code, because it does not really check if the WPA key is correct and that AP can be communicated.p  pWhat I am doing to check if a wireless interface is associated with an AP isp  ul licheck if codeioctl...,SIOCGIWAP,...code returns MAC address of some APli licheck if interface has IP configured I know that it will give no information in case of static configuration, but I can live with thatli licheck if encryption e.g. WEP, WPA, WPA2 used by AP and client is the same to ensure that after change of encryption method at the AP side, it will not be positively detected as connected.li ul  pI got stuck with the latest point  I can detect the encryption used by the AP, but I really do not know how to check what encryption is used by my host. Do you have idea how to check that Or maybe you know better ways to determine if connection between AP and client is workning I do not want to use ICMP or anything like this  my tool must be quick and thus do everything locallyp

I get a 401 response, with the message Incorrect Signature.p  pIts obvious the signature is the problem, but I dont know why its an incorrect signature because it gets generated by the dotnetopenauth library. I even checked the basestring, and that looks fine. So Some parameters must be wrong or something.p  pCould it be the problem is the domain from where the request is done. Im currently behind a proxy but added the proxys ip to the allowed domains list in my app p  pEdit Added LOGSp  pThe user gets redirected from the application to the Twitter Auth page, and then gets redirected to my app with the request token and verifier.

Negative 1912 pIve recently developed a drawing component for my company, featuring a Canvas on which you can draw certain shapes using clickanddrag. For each shape, I placed two adorners on its AdornerLayer One for increased hit detection basically a transparent rectangle that would exceed the shapes boundaries by a few pixels, and another for resizing four Thumb controls on the corners.p  pBut, I ran into many problems when implementing some of the features of the component, all adorner related.p  ul lipThey captured all preview events, since they were in another visual tree than the Canvas itself, that was unexpected, but I found a workaround, even if I did not like it that much. Using an AdornerDecorator did not solve this issue, a selection adorner as I implemented is a black hole for preview events.pli lipWhen I implemented zindex manipulation of shapes on the Canvas send to back, bring to front, etc, it worked fine using Panel.SetZIndex, as youd expect. But, the adorners are in another visual tree so they were not affected and the selection adorners were STILL on top of all other shapes, even if those shapes were on top of the one the selection adorner was detecting hits for. For example Shape1, SelectionAdorner1. Shape2, SelectionAdorner2. Shape1 is on top added later to the canvas of Shape2, so its overlapping it. So a click on it will be detected by SelectionAdorner1. I manipulated the ZIndex to send it to back, now Shape2 is on top and overlaps Shape1. I click on top of Shape2, but the click is detected by SelectionAdorner1 instead of SelectionAdorner2. This was particularly annoying. So, apparently since Adorners are on another visual tree, they dont respect ZIndexes. I tried to solve it by creating a DataBinding and also by manually setting between the ZIndex of the shape and the ZIndex of its SelectionAdorner. But this did not solve the issue. Altering the ZIndex of Adorners did not affect the way they were displayed on screen, maybe I was missing something, but it shouldnt be really this hard, since Adorners are supposed to be made to make things easier. The only solution I could come up with was manually removing all adorners and add them again manually one by one, adding for last the one that was supposed to be on top. That was retarded, but it worked.pli lipNext, Adorners dont respect ClipToBounds I set ClipToBoundstrue in the Canvas I was doing my drawing on, and it worked fine, but damn adorners would still work The solution to this was relatively painless, I just added an AdornerDecorator on top of each Shape. Not an ideal solution IMO, but one that was simple enough.pli lipAdorners not always react well to LayoutTransforms performed on their adorned elements. I have a Panel on top of the canvas which implements Zoom and Pan functionality. It used Animations to make zooming in and out more smooth. But using animations caused my Adorners to go ape The first zoom they would simply ignore the resize and stay the same size and position, on the second zoom they would scale to the empreviousem size of the adorned element. That did not make any sense only solution I could find was to disable animations, which thankfully workedpli ul  pI dont quite remember which other issues I had, but this was more than enough to mame me wonder about the usefulness of Adorners, and Im seriously considering not using them in my next project, which is similar to the one I described.p  pSo, can anyone tell me what could possibly be the pros of using these seemingly useful but incredibly annoying thingsp  pThanks.p
Negative 1912 pIm wondering whats the best column type to store latitudelongitude on MySQL  Rails.p  ul liPrecision must be enough to store every bit of latlng degrees obtained from mobile devices andor geocoders.li liStorage requirement should be minimal for the best query performance.li ul  pFrom Googles official documentp  pa hrefhttpcode.google.comapismapsarticlesphpsqlajaxv3.htmlhttpcode.google.comapismapsarticlesphpsqlajaxv3.htmlap  blockquote   pWith the current zoom capabilities of   Google Maps, you should only need 6   digits of precision after the decimal.   To keep the storage space required for   your table at a minimum, you can   specify that the lat and lng   attributes are floats of size 10,6.   That will let the fields store 6   digits after the decimal, plus up to 4   digits before the decimal, e.g.   123.456789 degrees.p blockquote  pSo, actually codeFLOAT10,6code is recommended by Google.p  pHowever, with Rails 3, there seems no easy way to define codeFLOATcode column type with precision after the decimal point. For instance, you could write a migration with raw SQL as followsp  precodedef self.up   execute ltltSQL   ALTER TABLE places     ADD lat FLOAT10,6,     ADD lng FLOAT10,6   SQL   addindex places, [ lat, lng ] end codepre  pBut the codeschema.rbcode as a consequence will look like thisp  precodet.float lat, limit gt 10 t.float lng, limit gt 10 codepre  pwhich is missing the precision for the fractional part.p  pHere I can see several optionsp  ul liUse codeFLOAT10,6code for optimal production performance, and dont dump schema e.g. coderake dbtestloadcode on development.li liUse codeDECIMAL10,6code, which is supported by Rails, but it takes 6 bytes, 1.5 times larger than codeFLOATcode see a hrefhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.1enstoragerequirements.htmlhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.1enstoragerequirements.htmla. Maybe this would be a good compromiseli liUse codeDOUBLEcode, which is much roomier than Googles requirement, and takes 8 bytes, 2 times larger than codeFLOATcode. Its simple as well.li ul  pWhats your recommendationp

Negative 1912 pA while ago I wrote a little RAII class to wrap the codesetOverrideCursorcode and coderestoreOverrideCursorcode methods on codeQApplicationcode.  Constructing this class would set the cursor and the destructor would restore it.  Since the override cursor is a stack, this worked quite well, as inp  precode    CursorSentry sentry     code that takes some time to process  codepre  pLater on, I found that in some cases, the processing code would sometimes take a perceptible time to process say more than half a second and other times it would be near instantaneous because of caching.  It is difficult to determine before hand which case will happen, so it still always sets the wait cursor by making a codeCursorSentrycode object.  But this could cause an unpleasant flicker where the cursor would quickly turn from the wait cursor to the normal cursor.p  pSo I thought Id be smart and I added a separate thread to manage the cursor override.  Now, when a codeCursorSentrycode is made, it puts in a request to the cursor thread to go to the wait state.  When it is destroyed it tells the thread to return to the normal state.  If the codeCursorSentrycode lives longer than some amount of time 50 milliseconds, then the cursor change is processed and the override cursor is set.  Otherwise, the change request is discarded.p  pThe problem is, the cursor thread cant technically change the cursor because its not the GUI thread.  In most cases, it does happen to work, but sometimes, if Im really unlucky, the call to change the cursor happens when the GUI thread gets mixed in with some other X11 calls, and the whole application gets deadlocked.  This usually only happens if the GUI thread finishes processing at nearly the exact moment the cursor thread decides to set the override cursor.p  pSo, does anyone know of a safe way to set the override cursor from a nonGUI thread.  Keep in mind that most of the time, the GUI thread is going to be busy processing stuff thats why the wait cursor is needed after all, so I cant just put an event into the GUI thread queue, because it wont be processed until its too late.  Also, it is impractical to move the processing Im talking about to a separate thread, because this is happening during a paint event and it needs to do GUI work when its done figuring out what to draw.p  pAny other ideas for adding a delay to setting the override cursor would be good, too.p

To remedy this, Im moving the tooltip if the image will go outside the window boundaries, which requires immediately knowing the images dimensions to avoid the tooltip jumping around. However, the images take a bit to load .gifs so I cant wait on DOM in order to get the dimensions. So, Im calling a PHP script to return the the image dimensions before they load.p  pThe problem Im having is that theres no response from my .get call.

Negative 1912 pSorry if this question has been answered elsewhere, but Ive spent awhile looking with no luck.p  pIn my web app, I ask users to specify urls to their blogs.  However, they dont always put http at the beginning of these urls.  Elsewhere on the site, when I link to these urls, the browser interprets them as relative urls.  e.g. if the user writes bobsblog.wordpress.com, the link goes to a hrefhttpwww.mydomain.combobsblog.wordpress.com relnofollowhttpwww.mydomain.combobsblog.wordpress.coma.p  pOne solution is to prepopulate the url field with http.  p  pBut a nicer solution would be to parse the url and add the scheme if the user hasnt.  Does rails offer a good way to do this  I looked at the function URIparse, but it doesnt seem to offer a good way of doing that.p

Negative 1912 pI just added some computationally expensive code to an Android game I am developing. The code in question is a collection of collision detection routines that get called very often every iteration of the gameloop and are doing a large amount of computation. I feel my collision detection implementation is fairly well developed, and as reasonably fast as I can make it in Java. p  pIve been using a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidedevelopingdebuggingdebuggingtracing.htmlTraceviewa to profile the code, and this new piece of collision detection code has somewhat unsurprisingly doubled the duration of my game logic. Thats obviously a concern since for certain devices, this performance hit could take my game from a playable to an unplayable state.p  pI have been considering different ways to optimize this code, and I am wondering if by moving the code into C and accessing it with the JNI, if I will get some noticeable performance savings p  pThe above question is my main concern and my reason for asking. Ive determined that the two following reasons would be other positive results from using the JNI. However, it is not enough to persuade me to port my code to C.p  ul lipThis would make the code cleaner. Since most of the collision detection is some sort of vector math, it is much cleaner to be able to use overloaded operators rather than using some more verbose vector classes in Java.pli lipMemory management would be simpler. Simpler you say Well, this is a game so the garbage collector running is not welcome because the GC could end up ruining the performance of your game if it constantly has to interrupt to clean up. In C I dont have to worry about the garbage collector, so I can avoid all the ugly things I do in Java with temporary static variables and just rely on the good old stack memory of Cpli ul  pLongwinded as this question may be, I think I covered all my points. Given this information, would it be worth porting my code from Java to C and accessing it with the JNI for reasons of improving performance Also, is there a way to measure or estimate a potential performance gainp  pEDITp  pSo I did it. Results Well from TraceViews perspective, it was a 6x increase in speed of my collision detection routine. p  pIt wasnt easy getting there though. Besides having to do the JNI dance, I also had to make some optimizations that I did not expect. Mainly, using a directly allocated float buffer to pass data from Java to native. My initial attempt just used a float array to hold the data in question because the conversion from Java to C was more natural, but that was realllly reallllly slow. The direct buffer completely sidestepped performance issues with array copying between java and native, and left me with a 6x bump. p  pAlso, instead of rolling my own vector class, I just used the Eigen math library. Im not sure how much of an affect this has had on performance, but at the least, it saved me the time of deving my own less efficient vector class.p  pAnother lesson learned is that excessive logging is bad for performance jic that isnt obvious.p

Negative 1912 pAs we create and drop temporary tables, inserts data into those tables, the size of the temp db and its log cause the database to grow in size unlimitedly. It reaches upto 100s of gb and fills the hard disk. This can cause the lack of size in database server and the application may crash. We need to restart the sqlexpress service which is I think is a bad idea. The stopping of service cause the siteapplication to go down. So what is the alternative for this problemp

Negative 1912 pI am doing string i.e. codechar arraycode processing with recursion. In my coderecursion treecode, string located at codechildcode has length less than 1 w.r.t its codeparentcode and all children at the same height have same length of string but different characters. I want to stop the recursion whenever new codestringcode length is greater than or equal to old string length, but i am unable to insert this condition in between recursion. Using codeSystem.exit0code terminates my complete program, which i dont want. Below is my code snippetp  precodeprivate static void getMinLenchar[] oldStr      int len  oldStr.length             This terminates the whole program, using break in place of       System.exit0 is not effective           if len lt 2         System.exit0      char[] newStr  new char[len  1]      for int i  0 i lt len  1 i                     Every character is matched with its next character and a new char           array is created having length len1                   getMinLennewStr       codepre  pActually when i put codeSystem.out.printlnlength  lencode in the 3rd line. First it prints the length in decreasing order but then length increases, decreases because of recursion. I mean the console shows the followingp  precodelength6 length5 length4 length3 length2 length1 length3 length3 length2 length1 length4 length3 length2 length1 codepre  pI simply want to stop my recursion whenever new length becomes greater than or equal to old length.p

Negative 1912 pI have a Tycho build which produces the eclipse plugins for an Xtext DSL feature. I now want to make a maven plugin which can process the DSL files. The problem is to get the artifacts the DSL plugin depends on into the maven plugin, as these are not in the Maven repositories. Also, I want the maven plugin to automatically depend on the same artifacts that the DSL plugin depends on.p  pI think that creating an berjar with the dependencies would be the best way to go. The problem is to retrieve the dependencies of the DSL plugin and copy these into a directory, so I can build this berjar.p  pHas anybody found a solution to this problem My searches just turn up solutions to the opposite problem importing a maven dependency into Tycho as P2 dependencies.p

Negative 1912 pI have a number of coordinate spaces measuring 65,536 by 65,536 and populated by many objects where no two can share the same coordinates.

However since I am beginning to utilise a whole lot of these coordinate spaces at once I have begun to look at ways to trim down on memory usage. p  pMy understanding of how javas HashMap works is basic, but considering that I can guarantee a unique hash for each object, it seems like I could be using a much more memory efficient version whichp  ul liDoesnt use buckets which can contain multiple objectsli liCan put and get objects by using the hash instead of using a keyli ul  pDoes such a HashMaplike collection existp  pedit The coordinate spaces are sparse, running at around 20003000 objects per.p

Negative 1912 pI have two related fields in a Yii model. They are itemsper and itemsperiod.p  pstrongitemsperstrong is an integer that reflects how many items to be processed in a given time period.p  pstrongitemsperiodstrong is the number of seconds in that period a dropdown with options labelled as seconds, minutes, hours. Multiply itemsper by itemsperiod and you have items per second.p  pIve got a custom validation rule set up to limit items per second being above a certain amount. That all works fine and gives a sensible error message using ajax validation when you change the value in the itemsper field on blur.p  pI need for the validation on the itemsper field to be triggered whenever the itemsperiod field is changed 100  second may not be allowed, but 100  minute is.p  pI tried adding an onchange function to the itemsper dropdown to trigger blur or change on the itemsper field, but it doesnt seem to make the ajax request for validation. Submitting the form just to trigger the validation isnt an option, as its possible it might not have any errors and simply save the record before the user is ready.p  pAny suggestions how I can force one field to trigger ajax validation in anotherp

SubAssemblies are further decomposed by the breakdown.   uses 3 tables    Table 1,  Assemblies contains the list of items needed to assemble any assembly.               the items can be subassemblies or components.    Comprises the following fields.      ComponentID, a text field to allow the user to recognise the item.      ParentID, a code field to allow linking.      NumberRequired, The number of units required for this level of this assembly.    For a given assembly, the items that go into its construction are entered into the    ComponentID field, while the parentID contains the code identifying the given assembly.  Table 2, Components contains the list of items recognised by the Assemblies Table    Comprises the following fields      ComponentID, a unique key, identifying the component      ComponentDescription describes the component      AssemblyBoolean to identify whether this is an assembly which has a breakdown       entered in the Assemblies Table.  Table 3, the Output Table is a variable purpose table which, in this example, identifies the       the components and the number required to construct any assembly    Comprises the following fields     ComponentID            the same format as the Component Table.

Gets the constituent items from the assembly table referencing the parentID.

One that can freeze all our frame based app. So we can not really use C events as much as we would like.p  pWhat have we done for each codeConsumercode component we subscribe to codeTargetscode events with actions that push all new data into a List and on codeComponentcode Update call we iterate thru list of new data and make our update.p  pSo my question is is there a way to generealise such approach say if we have not only want targets to affect our missiles but also codewindscode with there own incoming data for example direction and temprature to make code look nicep  pIs ther any more correct way of sending events in frame modelp

Negative 1912 pThe codeMedian of medianscode approach is very popular in codequicksortcode type partitioning algorithms to yield a fairly good pivot, such that it partitions the array uniformly. Its logic is given in Wikipedia asp  blockquote   pThe chosen pivot is both less than and greater than half of the elements in the list of medians, which is around n10 elements 12  n5 for each half. Each of these elements is a median of 5, making it less than 2 other elements and greater than 2 other elements outside the block. Hence, the pivot is less than 3n10 elements outside the block, and greater than another 3n10 elements outside the block. Thus the chosen median splits the elements somewhere between 3070 and 7030, which assures worstcase linear behavior of the algorithm.p blockquote  pCan somebody explain it a bit lucidly for me.

Negative 1912 pIm building a web application where businesses can log onto and post information about there business. When a user visits the web application, I want to able to get the users address and store it in a mysql database. When that user visits the web application home page, I want to be able to retrieve and list all of the businesses that are stored in my database, within a 30 mile radius. I also want to give the user the option of refining the list of businesses to a distance that they can specify with a jquery slider. In other words, if they wanted to see all of the businesses within a 10 mile radius, they could slide the slider to 10 miles and the businesses would be updated asynchronously. Ive searched the web and havent really been able to find a solid solution so I was hoping that maybe someone here on SO that has come across this in their own experience, could point me in the right direction.   p

Negative 1912 pMy first view is a UINavigationController with a rootview, which correctly shows a NavigationBar in IB in the .storyboard. I think this is nice when I am designing in IB, so I know the proportions, since the view is getting a little smaller with a navigationbar. This navigationbar from the navcontroller is pushed on all views in my app, but in IB the bar doesnt show, making it hard to figure out how its going to look. I have chosen inferred which I thought ment the NavController should automatic implement it, it is ok to just choose navigationcontroller  as the top bar in the Simulated Metrics In some of my viewcontrollers the navigationbar is there, and all settings are inferred.p  pThanks.p

My first thoughts were that it may did some kind of root exploiting to get full access to shared preferences where the settings are stored.p  pI did som research and analysing on the sdk and found similarities beetwen the sdk and a malware called a hrefhttpwww.csc.ncsu.edufacultyjiangPlanktonPlanktona. Both the malware and the SDK collects device info and sends a request to a CampC server and downloads a jar file with native code.  It exploits Dalvik class loading capability to stay stealthy instead of using root exploits. It supports some commands like setting homepage, shortcuts, and bookmarks and collecting browser history. p  pI have tried to manually download the jar from the server by using the url and adding the post data to it from the sdk but i didnt get it to work. Maybe i have messed with the post data. How can it change the settings without having root access and instead using dalivk exploit Any thoughts would be appreciated.p  pLink for  a hrefhttpdevelopers.startapp.comResourceSDKStartAppSearchSDK1.0.18.zipSDKap

Negative 1912 pI was wondering if there was a simple way to write an alias of a c class function. For instance, if I have some codelistcode container object, a logical function would bep  precode    int listlength  return len  codepre  pBut another logical alias that programmers might use could bep  precode    int listsize  return len  codepre  pSo, instead of writing both functions with their full body, is there any way to make codelistsizecode an alias of codelistlengthcode such that it isnt a duplicate when compiled, but rather references the same functionp  pIve read that you can do this with codedefinecode, but I dont want to cause any confusion with other codenames somewhere totally out of scope i.e. a size variable.br Ive also read that function pointers can fix it, but that isnt exactly an alias since it has to apply dereferencing, nor can function pointers be given a declaration, giving it a confusing helpline to users I would think, plus the confusion if ever I need to nest my code inside another object I have to adjust the scope.p  pOne of my guesses is, will the following be taken as a direct function alias by most optimizing compilersp  precode    inline int listlength  return len      inline int listsize  return length  codepre  pOr, is there any strict alias syntax for c I couldnt find any  wasnt surebr So then, what would be the most efficient way of doing thisp  pbEDITb Ive accepted the answer simply to wrap up the question, since its only a curiosity of mine. iAnyone with good information, please add comments or answer,i and I may even change my answer.p

Negative 1912 pIm building an app for a controlled environment.  I started using CDHTMLDialog Visual Studio 2012 thinking it would be quick and easy, but am rapidly finding that there is very little documentation.  Ive been able to figure most things out, but I keep running into gotchas due to the version of IE that the OLE control is using.p  pI have IE9 installed on this system running Win7 and since its a controlled app, I can guarantee that for all installs.  First, I noticed rounded corners dont work, so I figured it must be IE8.  Then I noticed that borderspacing doesnt work, but cellspacing does, so it must be using IE7.  Is there any way to get whatever this class is using updated to a current browser enginep  pThanks.p

Say if I initialise the array to [10] and the user adds 20 products, it is going to error.p  pThe second problem is the addItem function I know the problem with the logic that I have written here is that the index of the array that product is being written to is ONLY going to ever be as big as quantity so the array index of quantity is where the product is being written to not searching through this.order and finding a NULL array value and writing the product by the amount of times specified by the quantity paramiter. I am not sure where to go with this really.p  pThe next problem is the removeItem function which I imagine uses a similar sort of logic to the addItem. I have not written anything here as my attempts have been wrong and I couldnt get the addItem function to work for a start so I left this.p  pThe last problem is the toString method. The toString method gets the whole array defined SAY this.order  new Product[10] which I dont really want it to do. p  pFOR EXAMPLEp  precodeint id, String name, String description, int cost, int serves  Starter s  new Starter25, Salad, A traditional English salad, 750, 1 Order o3  new ArrayOrder o3.addItems, 2 codepre  pTHE codetoStringcode METHOD PRODUCESp  precode[Salad  A traditional English salad serves 1 7.50, Salad  A traditional English salad serves 1 7.50, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null] codepre  pI want it to stop before null, null, null etc.. but it is taking in the whole Array and 8 of them are null values Im unsure about how to fix this. Is there anyway around the Array and defining its length in my example above I have only added 2 items but I declared an Array of length [10] how would I know what length to define the Array If the user added 20 starters in my example above, the program would crash...p  pThe numberOfItems amp totalCost functions work when I have tested them with a main method.p  pAny guidance to point me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. Thanks,p  pEDIT I think I have been a little unclear the requirements are that I am to create several classes based on a UML diagram.

Negative 1912 pIm new to programming still a student. I was teaching myself Python, tried running a program on a webserver, and decided to use web2py as it is geared for beginners like me.

I know that theres some different syntax when using web2py, but the example code I found all seems to show a return, response.flash, response.print, using print strDIV and a few others I found but am getting nowhere with.  Also when I return index that returns None  Id think it would return the values that are then later supposed to be printed by the for loop.p  pThe index function gets a list of urls, but the supporting functions are fairly long but have not returned any errors.p

Negative 1912 pI would like to check if a codestdthreadcode has finished execution. Searching stackoverflow I found the following a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9094422howtocheckifastdthreadisstillrunningquestiona which addresses this issue. The accepted answer proposes having the worker thread set a variable right before exiting and having the main thread check this variable. Here is a minimal working example of such a solutionp  precodeinclude ltunistd.hgt include ltthreadgt  void work bool signalfinished     sleep 5    signalfinished  true   int main    bool threadfinished  false   stdthread workerwork, ampthreadfinished    while  threadfinished        do some own work until the thread has finished ...       worker.join  codepre  pSomeone who commented on the accepted answer claims that one cannot use a simple codeboolcode variable as a signal, the code was broken without a memory barrier and using codestdatomicltboolgtcode would be correct. My initial guess is that this is wrong and a simple codeboolcode is sufficient, but I want to make sure Im not missing something. strongDoes the above code need a codestdatomicltboolgtcode in order to be correctstrongp  pLets assume the main thread and the worker are running on different CPUs in different sockets. What I think would happen is, that the main thread reads codethreadfinishedcode from its  CPUs cache. When the worker updates it, the cache coherency protocol takes care of writing the workers change to global memory and invalidating the main threads CPUs cache so it has to read the updated value from global memory. Isnt the whole point of cache coherence to make code like the above just workp

Negative 1912 pI work at a retailer and we consider to introduce CQ5 as a CMS.p  pHowever, after doing some research and talking to consultants it turns out, that there may be things that may be complicated. Perhaps one of you can shed a little light on this.p  pThe first thing is, we were told that when you use the Multi Site Manager to create multi language pages about 80 languages the update process can be as slow as half an hour until a change is ultimately published. Did someone of you experience something similarp  pThe other thing is, that the TarOptimizer has pretty long running times. I was told that runs that take up to 24 hours are not uncommon. Again my question Did someone of you had such a problem or has an explanation for thisp  pI am really looking forward to your response.p

Negative 1912 pI am developing a web application which will encrypt data on the client side, then send the data to a server. The server will store the encrypted data, but will emnotem have the ability to decrypt  the data. The point is to keep the clients data secure, so that not even the server hosts have access to the data. This can be guaranteed by the fact that the server only receives encrypted data and never receives the key.p  pI plan to use Javascript for the encryption and decryption on the client side. Additionally, the connection will be secured with SSL.p  pI read the article here a hrefhttpwww.matasano.comarticlesjavascriptcryptography relnofollowhttpwww.matasano.comarticlesjavascriptcryptographya which suggests that Javascript should not be used for encryption, but it doesnt address my use case.p  pIs this a secure solution Is there a way that I can make it more securep

I have a similar problem in DataGrids  the exclamation mark overlaps the righthand edge of the containing cell, rather than the column width increasing to accommodate it.p  pUsing Snoop, it appears that the template is being displayed in an adorner layer which I assume is a separate visual tree This would explain why the windows layout isnt recalculated to take into account the exclamation mark. Can anyone suggest a way to achieve what I want p
Negative 1912 pLibevent is great and I love it so far. However, on a echo server, the write only sends to the socket on a second write. My writing is from another thread, a pump thread that talks to a db and does some minimal data massaging.p  pI verified this by setting up a callback for the writep  precodebuffereventsetcb GetBufferEvent, DataAvailable, DataWritten, HandleSocketError, this  codepre  pcalling buffereventflush mbufferEvent, EVREADEVWRITE, BEVNORMAL  doesnt seem to have any effect.p  pHere is the setup, just in case I blew it somewhere. I have dramatically simplified the overhead in my code base in order to obtain some help. This includes initialization of sockets, my thread init, etc. This is a multithreaded app, so there may be some problem there. I start with thisp  precodemLibEventInstance  eventbasenew evthreadusewindowsthreads mlistener  evconnlistenernewbind mLibEventInstance,           OnAccept,           this,          LEVOPTCLOSEONFREE  LEVOPTCLOSEONEXEC  LEVOPTREUSEABLE,           1, no maximum number of backlog connections          struct sockaddrampListenAddress, socketSize      if mlistener            perrorCouldnt create listener           return false        evconnlistenerseterrorcb mlistener, OnSystemError  codepre  pAFAIK, this is copy and paste from samples so it should work. My OnAccept does the followingp  precodevoid  OnAccept evconnlistener listenerObj, evutilsockett newConnectionId, sockaddr ClientAddr, int socklen, void context        We got a new connection Set up a bufferevent for it.      struct eventbase  base  evconnlistenergetbase listenerObj      struct bufferevent bufferEvent  buffereventsocketnew base, newConnectionId, BEVOPTCLOSEONFREE      buffereventsetcb GetBufferEvent, DataAvailable, DataWritten,                                     HandleSocketError, this      We have to enable it before our callbacks will be called.    buffereventenable GetBufferEvent, EVREAD  EVWRITE     DisableNagle mconnectionId   codepre  pNow, I simply respond to data coming in and store it in a buffer for later processing. This is a multithreaded application, so I will process the data later, massage it, or return a response to the client.p  precodevoid     DataAvailable struct bufferevent bufferEventObj, void arg   const U32   MaxBufferSize  8192    MyObj   This  MyObj arg    U8          data[ MaxBufferSize ]    sizet      numBytesreceived      Read 8k at a time and send it to all connected clients.     while 1            numBytesreceived  buffereventread bufferEventObj, data, sizeof data         if numBytesreceived lt 0   nothing to send                 break               if This                  ThisgtOnDataReceived data, numBytesreceived              codepre  pthe last thing that happens, once I look up my data, package into a buffer, and then on a threaded timeslice I do thisp  precodebuffereventwrite mbufferEvent, buffer, bufferOffset  codepre  pIt never, ever sends the first time. To get it to send, I have to send a second buffer full of data.p  pThis behavior is killing me and I have spent a lot of hours on it. Any ideasp  pp  pI finally gave up and used this hack instead... there just was not enough info to tell me why libevent wasnt writing to the socket. This works just fine.p  precodeint result  send mconnectionId, const char buffer, bufferOffset, 0  codepre

Negative 1912 pI was wondering if the functionality given by Weka of building Model trees like M5P which has regression models in the leaves is possible in R. I know there is a way to handle it using the RWeka package. What was somehow strange to me is that the functionality does not exist in other R packages like rpart. The only way to get a Model Tree is using the Rweka package  Thanks for clarification. p

Negative 1912 pIm building a invoice app for iOS. I need a way to sync data between several devices of the same company that use the app. This have the common customers, product, inventory, invoicesdetail tables.p  pI wonder if firebase is suitable for this. p  pMainly, my main concern is that some iOS devices need to operate disconnected for some time up to 1 day, people work in locations with poor or nonexistent communication.p  pMy second concern is for some customers that could use it as POS, and generate large amounts of invoices, to the same company group. My app is used for small supermarkets and wholesale distributors, that is the reason some travel and some stay in a local.p  pFor the look of it, I emthinkem firebase is the closer solution for this Im considering pusher, parse and pubnub because have a copy of the data and become the database master of this.p  pI have think in have a central postgress database as the database master, but maybe unnecesary with firebasep
Negative 1912 pIm trying to create a file vault that is locked using biometrics.  Using a library like libCrypto seems a nice plan.  Its simple to store things in the vault as the public key can be kept in the clear.  p  pHowever the part Im struggling with is how you convert from the biometrics to the private key.  I assume I need to store the private key somewhere but I cant figure out how.  Otherwise I run the risk of using a very secure system for file storage and then suffering from a far less secure private key.p  pIm sure there must be a solution to this, I just cant think of one.p

I tested it. but the above code works in firefox.  So Im assuming its playing the webm version of the file. Is this correct p  pThanks.p

Any user profile can be accessed from any machine. Any changes to the database entries should be reflected on all machines.p  pI am confused about how I should achieve this deployment. According to my research p  p1.The database should be deployed on one machine . This machine will acts as the database      server .p  pMy problems   I am familiar with accessing databases on local machine but how to access a remote database. Is the connection string the only thing that needs to be addressed or are there any other issues  too Do I need to install SQL SERVER on all machines or only on the server machine  Do I have to deal with concurrency issues multiple users accessingmodifying same data simultaneously or is it handled by the database enginep  p2.The application can be deployed in 2 ways     i. Storing the executable on a shared network drive on the server.Providing shortcut on desktop of each machine.   ii. Storing the executable itself on each machine.p  pMy Problems      How does approach 1 work  One instance of an executable running on multiple machines  s     In approach 2 , will the changes in database entries be reflected on all machines appropriately     In approach 2, if there are changes to the application , is there any method to update it on all machines   Other than redeploying it on each machine      Which approach is preferable     Do I need to install the .NET framework all machinesp  pWill I have to make any other system changes  firewall,security,permissions  If given a choice to install the operating system on each machine ,which version of windows is preferable for such an application environment p  pThis is my first time deploying a multiuser database application on a network.Ill be very grateful for any suggestionsadvice,references,etc.  p

Negative 1912 pWhen I open any .css file in any project in Visual Studio 2012, it immediately crashes.p  pIve tried restarting my computer, reinstalling Visual Studio, installing a Visual Studio update and uninstalling all of my Visual Studio extensions.p  pThe problem started this morning  last night I had a power outage and my computer, which was running Visual Studio at the time, crashed. p  pI wish I could supply more details but this is all I have. The problem isnt specific to a project or a file, but AFAIK only to .css files.p  pEdit Running Visual Studio in Safe Mode fixes the problem in some projects but not in all  specifically, in a standalone, standard website project I can edit .css files fine, but in my TFShosted team project I cant, which is making it impossible for me to work..

Ive tried reinstalling, restarting, and repairing, nothing works. There have been similiar complaints that Ive found but they all have something to do with some extension messing Visual Studio up.. The only extensions I had were Web Essentials and Resharper, both now uninstalled, and they worked fine until this morning.p

Negative 1912 pIve written some memory allocation code in c as an exercise. It is translated almost purely to macro now. By doing this Ive been able to reduce allocation time to something similar to glibc malloc unoptimized. However, running the test with gcc Ox where x  0, I cant get anywhere near glibcs speed  glibc beats me by around 102p  pI understand that the glibc malloc implementation is based on Doug Leas dlmalloc and the comments suggest the code does benefit from optimizing compilers. I havent looked into why this is and I am not clued up on compiler optimization tricks and was wondering if anybody knew or could give a hint on what techniques are commonly usedp

Negative 1912 pI am using some ExpandoObject dynamics in a MVC application of mine and I am running into the above error. It only is seeming to happen with one or two properties but it is consistent. I will get the runtime error stating that no such property exists and then, when looking deeper and expanding the dynamic view of the the object in the VS debugger the property exists on the object and has a value. p  pHas anyone experienced this before and if so do you have any insightp  pI have tried casting the object to see if that would work but I got the same error. The code that I used to cast it follows as an example of some of the things I have already tried mostly just to see if I could get at the property at all.p  precodevar cur  new ExpandoObject as IDictionaryltstring, objectgt cur  inputDynamic string property  stringcur[propertyName] codepre

Negative 1912 pI am creating an Android app and I have yet to run out of memory until just now.  The part that is confusing is it was not a way I would expect to run out of memory.p  pI simply added a new Linear Layout to a layout xml file.  It had a background of an image that was 40kb large.  The other images that were loaded were approximately 12kb with the background being much larger at 120kb.  When this image was loaded I would receive a Fatal Signal 11 on runtime.  If I removed the background from the layout it would work fine.  I then changed the image to be much smaller, it was 2000x600 before so now it is 14kb.  It now works fine.  It is clear that the extra 26kb was causing a problem...p  pWhat kind of precautions should I take to ensure this doesnt happen again.  Obviously I would like quality images and the 2000x600 might be excessive as its an app for a phone but what guidelines should I followp  pIs there a memory usage cap that can be extended or that I should look to stay under  Also, if I loaded many images on a scrollview will this cause the app to crash  I have had many images loaded at once but have never had it crash before, Im just confused as to the error being caused by very little memory usage.  In todays terms at least.p  pRegards,p  pJakep

Increasing the border thickness causes the same behavior, so its not started at the layers bottom.p  pHow can I get the shadow to start from the bottom of the border I saw that you can do this by setting the border as a background image as done a hrefhttpdev.opera.comarticlesviewcss3borderbackgroundboxshadowboxshadow relnofollowherea, but is there no way to do this in CSS  I can get around this by making the shadow larger, though, that is not what my design calls for.p  pThis is what Id likep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqO7n7.png altenter image description herep  pstrongEDITstrong StackOverFlow UI, you are right, this will work correctly.  Thank you for the example  The reason why the shadow was appearing in the middle was because the style was applied both to the table itself as well as the row that it contained.  Removing that style class reference from one or the other would fix the issue.  This unearthed a deeper issue in the layout, beyond the scope of this question.

Negative 1912 pOn Windows Server 2003, my application has started taking a long time to load on fresh install. Suspecting the DLLs are not loading to their preferred address and this is taking some time the application has over 100 DLLs, 3rd parties included I ran the sysinternals listDLLs utility, asking it to flag every dll that has been relocated. Oddly enough, for most of the DLLs in the list I get something like thisp  precodeBase        Size      Path    Relocated from base of 0x44e90000 0x44e90000  0x39000   validation.dll codepre  pThat is they are flagged as relocated and the load time definitely seems to support that theory but their load address remains the preferred address. p  pSome third party DLLs seem to be immune from this, but as a whole this happens to 90 of the DLLs loaded by the application.p  pOn windows 7, it would seem the only flagged DLLs are ones that actually move, and loading time is as expected significantly faster.p  pWhat is causing this How can I stop it p  pEdited Since it sounds in theory like the effects of ASLR, I checked and while the OS DLLs are indeed ASLRenabled, ours are not. And even those are relocated in place, and therefore not taking up the address for any of the other DLLs.p

Negative 1912 pI am trying to generate a parser in JavaScript via Jison for the language a hrefhttpchuck.cs.princeton.edu relnofollowChucKa, and have got off to a good start except that there are ambiguities in the language which the generated parser is unable to handle. The original ChucK compiler is generated by Bison, and that must somehow be able to resolve these ambiguities.p  pFor the purposes of this question Ive simplified the problem to a construed grammar which presents only one ambiguity. For reference Ive put up a a hrefhttpsgist.github.comaknuds17874252 relnofollowgista of all the involved files including the generated a hrefhttpsgist.github.comaknuds17874252fileparserjs relnofollowparsera.

This makes Jison emit the following warningp  precodeStates with conflicts State 7   TypeDecl gt ID . lookaheads ID SEMICOLON OP   PrimaryExpression gt ID . lookaheads ID SEMICOLON OP codepre  pAnd the generated parser fails to parse the test code codeType var gt outcode like sop  precodeError Parse error on line 1 Unexpected SEMICOLON codepre  pTo my understanding, its the part after the codegtcode operator that the parser tries to match against the rule codeTypeDecl VarDeclListcode.p  pSo, how can I generate a parser that is able to deal with this ambiguityp

Not taking this in to account causes motion jitter at moderately high speeds.p  pI did not write this code and it appears to work. I had trouble altering this for angles because, for example, an interpolation between the angles 350 and 10 would take the long way round instead of going in the direction of the 20 difference in angle. p  pIve looked into quaternion slerp but havent been able to find an implementation that takes a time delta into account. Something that I have thought of, but not been able to implement either, is to interpolate between both angles twice, but the second time with a phase difference of 180 on each angle and to output the smaller of the two multiplied by 1.p  pWould appreciate any help or directionp

Negative 1912 pI reading a hrefhttpralphschindler.com20120309phpconstructorbestpracticesandtheprototypepattern relnofollowthe following articlea and got very confused on the Dynamic Class Instantiation part. Specifically this code snippetp  precodeobj  new className if obj instanceof SomeBaseType      throw new InvalidTypeException  codepre  pI dont understand what this is actually doing for you. If its not an instance of a base class it errors out. How is that helpful It doesnt get an instance of the correct type, or perform a different action based on the current type, it just throws an exception. Im having trouble conceptualizing the purpose of this code and the article didnt really clear it up for me.p  pComplete section from the articlep  pDynamic Class Instantiationp  pGenerally speaking, the following code, while legal, should be used very seldom, and only when other possible instantiation patterns have been exhaustedp  precodeobj  new className if obj instanceof SomeBaseType      throw new InvalidTypeException  codepre  pWhy is this a bad pattern First, it makes the assumption up front that the constructor signature is free from any required parameters. While this is good for object types that are already known to this factory, it might not always be true of a consumers subtype of the base object in question. This patten should never be used on objects that have dependencies, or in situations where it is conceivable that a subtype might have dependencies because this takes away the possibility for a subtype to practice constructor injection.p  pAnother problem is that instead of managing an object, or a list of objects, you are now managing a class name, or list of class names in addition to an object or list of objects. Instead, one could simply manage the objects.p  pIf, on the other hand, you know this particular object type is no more than a value object or similar, with no chance of it needing dependencies in subtypes, you can then cautiously use this instantiation pattern.p

Negative 1912 pI am using animate.css to create a hover action. On mouseenter I fadeinDown and fadeIn a text overlay to an image on a website. on mouseleave I fadeOut and fadeOutUp the text overlay. p  pOn two of these images, there is a link. It works fine, except on mobile browsers where there is no hover. When a user clicks on the image in say, iOS Safari the animation effect displays the text containing the link. However, what often happens is the user clicks on the image, they also click on the link even though it hasnt appeared yet  which in this case sends the user to a different website.p  pWhat Id like to have happen is on iOS and probably other nonhover platforms for the user to click the image with the link disabled, have the animation effect reveal the text, and then enable the link once the animation is complete.p  pIm doing this right now with jQuery  all the images that are animated are class caption and the ones with links are class FE.p  pThis seems to work  sort of well. Hard to explain, it seems to take care of the disabling the link but it often takes a few presses to get it to act as a link again.p  precode    .FE.hover function .caption.click functionev      ev.preventDefault         .caption, FE.bindwebkitAnimationEnd oanimationend msAnimationEnd animationend, function     this.unbindclick.click       codepre  pIm not much of a JSJQuery expert, the above is cobbled together from a few hours of googling. Hopefully someone can shed some light on the proper way to code this.p

Negative 1912 pSo just got into the basics of trycatch statements in java. Im still a bit confused on some differences within the syntax. Here is the code im trying to analyze and understand. Also, whats the difference between using try then catchException e as compared to saying just throws...or throw new... From my understanding, a try catch is basically a way to handle the error by outputting a message or passing to another method. However, i think im stuck on the syntax aspect of it.

Negative 1912 pIm working on my first real iPad app using Xamarin, and Im trying to figure out if theres a way to navigate from the Detail view in a Split View Controller to another View Controller. The Master and Detail views are both tables, and I would like a row click on the Detail view to navigate away from the Split View and into a single view controller, not just the Detail view which Ive been able to do. I havent found much on this topic, so Im wondering if this is not a viable or suggested way of handling navigation in iOS.p  pThe code would look something like whats below using Xamarin  C, but if I can get the Navigation Controller working for the whole Split View, Im thinking the row click would have to be handled in SearchSplitViewController instead of on the Detail View Controller If I place the Detail View Controller in a Navigation Controller, it navigates to the next page, but the Master View is still on the left.p  pAppDelegatep  precodeUINavigationController rootNavigationController  new UINavigationController      SearchSplitViewController split  new SearchSplitViewController  rootNavigationController.PushViewControllersplit, false  this.window.RootViewController  new rootNavigationController codepre  pCode called from SplitView Detail on row clickp  precodeMyViewController vc  new MyViewControllerid this.NavigationController.PushViewController vc , true codepre  pAny suggestions or sample code C or ObjectiveC are greatly appreciated.

Negative 1912 pIm trying to wrap the apache avrotools avrotools1.7.5.jar concat utility to do globbing properly as written, all files to be concatenated need to be written out fully. This utility is needed because a regular codecatcode or in my case codehadoop fs catcode operation will produce data with headers in the middle and cause errors in avro parsing utilities. I wrote a simple shell script named codecatavro.shcodep  precodeavrohdfshadoop jar pathtojaravrotools1.7.5.jar DIRShadoop fs ls 1  egrep .avro  awk print 8 echo avrohdfs concat DIRS    dash  tells utility to print to stdout codepre  pThis does stuff, but if I run codebash catavro.sh [path to avro data on hdfs] gt tmp.avrocode the result is a corrupted avro file. Errors get thrown when trying to read the schema, or do anything else. If I replace the last line in the shell script withp  precodeecho avrohdfs concat DIRS  codepre  pto print the command only, and then run the resulting command on my terminal, storing the result into the same tmp.avro file, things work nicely. The filesize of tmp.avro is a bit bigger.p  pIm pretty sure that the codeechocode command is to blame here, it appears to be corrupting the binary data resulting from the avrotools concat unitlity. Replacing the last line of the sh file withp  precodeavrohdfs concat DIRS  gt tmp.avro codepre  pyields the same successful result as returning the command and running it in the terminal. However, though I can write to files, it would be much better for me if I could return this to codestdoutcode so that it can be piped into a filtering utility I have.p  pWhat are the alternatives to codeechocode I have tried replacing the last line in the script with all of the following without successp  precodeecho E avrohdfs concat DIRS  avrohdfs concat DIRS  avrohdfs concat DIRS  cat avrohdfs concat DIRS  trap avrohdfs concat DIRS  0 sort of works, but data misses the gttmp.avro and spits into the termal codepre  pI have checked the PATH variable, it is the same in my terminal and in the shell script.

Negative 1912 pI am trying to help a friend troubleshoot some strange javascript issues in SharePoint 2010, but Im confused so far.p  pI have a simple page with several divs, each of which has a header and starts displayed. Some simple jQuery adds an event handler to the header such that when it is clicked, the text of its matching div is hidden. This all seems to work fine. However on checking in changes to a page, very large attributes are added to each div that seem to correspond with some sort of jQuery event handler. This happens every time a page is checked in a new attribute is added each time there is a checkin, not replacing the old one.p  pFor example, in one div, as one of checkinp  precodejquery11010622176936632799847 codepre  pappears. Since there have been several checkins, there are tons of these. Other divs are populated with lots of sizzle attributes like below.p  precodesizzle1386877979872[object Object] codepre  pA div either has sizzle or jquery attributes but not both. The sizzle attributes have only been appearing as of a few months ago, it was only jquery before.p  pI found a similar problem at a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14640365sharepoint2010jquerymultipleattributesaddedincontenteditorwebparteSharepoint 2010  Jquery  Multiple attributes added in content Editor webpart edit  savea, however the only answer seems to be fairly messy script solution that does not seem to address the root of the problem.p  pHas anyone run into this issue before  have a sense of where these attributes are coming from and how to prevent them They seem to be serving very little tangible purpose, and make pages large and tedious to edit. Any help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1912 pI am having a very odd problem in R. The question was to make a function for global and semi global allignment. Appropriate algorithms were made which are able to print out the correct allignment. However returning the alginment seems to be a problem for the semi global algorithm. p  pBelow are the functions for both alignments which both contain two functions one computing the score matrix and the other outputs the alignment. As you can see, the output function for semi global was inspired by the global one but although it is able to print out values A and B, when returning A and B a value NULL is returned. p  pIt came to my attention that when making defining A and B, they also contain a NULL part which seen by printing the structures of A and B at the end. This is also the case in the global alignment but does not seem to be a problem here. p  pstrongGlobal Alignment Algorithmstrongp  precode GLOBAL ALLIGNMENT ALGORITHM   GAscore  functionv,w,score.gap3,score.match8,score.mismatch5 v  strsplitv,split[[1]] w  strsplitw,split[[1]]  S  matrix0,nrowlengthv1,ncol  lengthw1  S[1,1]  0  forj in 2dimS[2]     S[1,j]  score.gapj1   fori in 2dimS[1]     S[i,1]  score.gapi1     forj in 2dimS[2]     ifv[i1]w[j1]diag  S[i1,j1]  score.match else diag              S[i1,j1]  score.mismatch         down  S[i1,j]  score.gap         right  S[i,j1]  score.gap         S[i,j]  maxdiag,down,right        returnS    GAoutput  functionv,w,S,score.gap3,score.match8,score.mismatch5 v  strsplitv,split[[1]] w  strsplitw,split[[1]] Ac Bc  GArec  functionA,B,S,i,j,v,w,score.gap,score.match,score.mismatch      if i1  j1         ifigt1             fori1 in seqi1,1,1                  A  cv[i1],A                 B  c,B                               ifjgt1             forj1 in seqj1,1,1                 A  c,A                 B  cw[j1],B                           returnlistvA,wB           ifv[i1]w[j1] diag  score.match else diagscore.mismatch       if S[i,j]  S[i1,j1]  diag         A.temp  cv[i1],A         B.temp  cw[j1],B         GArecA.temp,B.temp,S,i1,j1,v,w,score.gap,score.match,score.mismatch           else if S[i,j]  S[i1,j]  score.gap         A.temp lt cv[i1],A         B.temp lt c,B         GArecA.temp,B.temp,S,i1,j,v,w,score.gap,score.match,score.mismatch          else          A.temp  c,A         B.temp  cw[j1],B         GArecA.temp,B.temp,S,i,j1,v,w,score.gap,score.match,score.mismatch        return GArecA,B,S,lengthv1,lengthw1,v,w,score.gap,score.match,score.mismatch    codepre  pstrongSemiGlobal Alignment Algorithmstrongp  precode SEMI GLOBAL ALLIGNMENT ALGORITHM  SGAscore  functionsequence1,sequence2,score.gap1,score.match1,score.mismatch1 vsequence2 wsequence1  v  strsplitv,split[[1]] w  strsplitw,split[[1]] S  matrix0,nrowlengthv1,ncollengthw1  fori in 1lengthw1     for j in 1lengthv1         if i1j1S[i,j]0         else             ifilengthw1  jlengthv1                 from.top  S[i,j1]                 from.left  S[i1,j]                          else                 from.top  maxS[i,j1]score.gap    Max is artifact from max0,...                  from.left  maxS[i1,j]score.gap                          ifw[i1]  v[j1]                 from.diag  S[i1,j1]score.match                          else                 from.diag  S[i1,j1]score.mismatch                          S[i,j]  maxfrom.top,from.left,from.diag                 returnS   SGAoutput  functionv,w,S,score.gap1,score.match1,score.mismatch1 v  strsplitv,split[[1]] w  strsplitw,split[[1]] Ac Bc printstrA printstrB  SGArec  functionA,B,S,i,j,v,w,score.gap,score.match,score.mismatch      if i1  j1         ifigt1             fori1 in seqi1,1,1                  A  cv[i1],A                 B  c,B                               ifjgt1             forj1 in seqj1,1,1                 A  c,A                 B  cw[j1],B                               printA         printB         out  listvA,wB         printout         printstrA         printstrB         printstrout         returnout           ifv[i1]w[j1] diag  score.match else diagscore.mismatch       if S[i,j]  S[i1,j1]  diag         A.temp  cv[i1],A         B.temp  cw[j1],B         SGArecA.temp,B.temp,S,i1,j1,v,w,score.gap,score.match,score.mismatch                if  jlengthw1    Are we in last row         score.temp  score.gap         score.gap0          elsescore.tempscore.gap      ifS[i,j]  S[i1,j]  score.gap         A.temp lt cv[i1],A         B.temp lt c,B         score.gap  score.temp         SGArecA.temp,B.temp,S,i1,j,v,w,score.gap,score.match,score.mismatch           score.gapscore.temp          ifilengthv1         score.tempscore.gap         score.gap0          elsescore.tempscore.gap      ifS[i,j]  S[i,j1]  score.gap         A.temp  c,A         B.temp  cw[j1],B         score.gapscore.temp         SGArecA.temp,B.temp,S,i,j1,v,w,score.gap,score.match,score.mismatch         returnSGArecA,B,S,lengthv1,lengthw1,v,w,score.gap,score.match,score.mismatch      S1  SGAscoreACGTCAT,TCATGCA S1   align  SGAoutputACGTCAT,TCATGCA,S1 align codepre  pI am surpised that the global alignment works but the semi global one doesnt, even tough they both have this NULL part can someone maybe explain what this is Has it something to do with internal objects in a function and the semi global knows what A and B is.p  pAny help is greatly appreciatedp

This part works well also. p  pThe new cart contents line items include name, the qty is displayed in an input, and the price.p  pThe newly created line items qty input is not reacting the the onblur action i think due to the fact that it hasnt been bound to anything since it didnt exist on page load.p  pCan some amazing gentleman  or woman and scholar help me understand how to bind the new inputs so I can call an ajax function to update the item qty when the field blursp  pMy JSp  precodedocument.readyfunction    function updatecart       var dataString        alert dataStringreturn false     .ajax         type POST,         dataType html,         data dataString,         url actionsupdatecart.action.php,         beforeSend function              loader.show         ,         complete function              loader.hide         ,         success functiondata               cartitems.hide.htmldata.fadeIn slow          ,         error functiondata             msg.hide.htmlltdiv classcolmd8gtltdiv classalert alertdanger alertdismissablegtltbutton typebutton classclose datadismissalert ariahiddentruegtamptimesltbuttongtError Updating Cartltdivgt.slideDown fast                   function      button[idadd].onclick, function         var id   this .dataid          var dataString  id id            alert dataStringreturn false          .ajax             type POST,             dataType html,             data dataString,             url actionsadd.action.php,             beforeSend function                  loader.show             ,             complete function                  loader.hide             ,             success updatecart ,             error functiondata                 msg.hide.htmlltdiv classcolmd8gtltdiv classalert alertdanger alertdismissablegtltbutton typebutton classclose datadismissalert ariahiddentruegtamptimesltbuttongtError Adding Itemltdivgt.slideDown fast                               return false        function      input[idlineitem].onblur, function         var id   this .dataid         var qty   this .val          var dataString  id id  ampqty  qty         alert dataStringreturn false         .ajax             type POST,             dataType html,             data dataString,             url actionsadd.action.php,             beforeSend function                  loader.show             ,             complete function                  loader.hide             ,             success updatecart ,             error functiondata                   msg.hide.htmlltdiv classcolmd8gtltdiv classalert alertdanger alertdismissablegtltbutton typebutton classclose datadismissalert ariahiddentruegtamptimesltbuttongtError Updating Quanityltdivgt.slideDown fast                               return false          codepre  pMy Returned html and php foreach that creates itp  precodeforeachSESSION[basket][items] as item gt ltdiv classcartitemgt     ltdiv classcollg8 colmd8 np itemgtltphp echo item[name] gtltdivgt     ltdiv classcollg2 colmd2 npgtltdiv classinputgroupgtltinput dataidltphp echo item[id] gt idlineitemltphp echo item[id] gt valueltphp echo item[count] gt typetext classformcontrolgtltdivgtltdivgt     ltdiv classcollg2 colmd2 np pricegtltphp echo item[price] gtltdivgt ltdivgt ltphp   gt codepre  pThanks to anyone who can help me get my mind around how to do this.

Negative 1912 pI have a rooted Sony prs900, running a linux 2.6.23 2 PREEMPT kernel, for strongARMv6strong. Montavista linux kernel.  Im having problems with figuring out how power management works, both for running the system and for powering up and down the audio port. I can neither figure out how to read the batterypowerline status information, nor get the audio chip to play sound, etc ... although I have been studying the kernel modules for a while...p  pIts worth a little money for help, say 100 paypal donation to an email account, or more if this takes a long time... for the first person able to explain to me how to do them in a way that works. Eg read battery status, and change some power modes like getting the audio amplifiers to power updown so that the audio played to codedevdspcode oss emulation actually comes out as sound rather than just being consumed by the chip and ignored...p  pThe actual sony kernel, and binary packages of cross compiler tools are located on the a hrefhttpwww.sony.netProductsLinuxAudioPRS900.html relnofollowmain pagea.   a hrefhttpwww.sony.netProductsLinuxAudioDownloadPRS900linux2.6.23091126.tgz relnofollowActual kernel sourcecodea is also available.p  hr  pWhat I have learned so far myself p  pThe sony is using a wolfson micro WM8350 audio driver and battery chargerpower management chip for all the systems power eg it can power downup the SD memory cards, send more power to the cpu, power up audio amplifiers, etc. See a hrefhttpwww.wolfsonmicro.comdocumentsuploadsdatasheetsenWM8350.pdf relnofollowWM8350 Datasheeta.  p  pPretty much, the whole problem revolves around getting the WM8350 kernel drivers to work... Although the company brags quite a bit about its support under linux, they dont have any application notes or examples that are actually emhelpfulem that I can find, other than the datasheet.  I suspect the kernel drivers I have are beta code, because they dont seem to be behaving well several error messages in the kernel log about wm8350 registers not being readable happen at every boot even when running only the sonys native software....p  pThe kernel drivers sourcecode of most interest are in  linux2.6.23091126driversmxcpmiccore,wm8350 Notice, the wm8350 is a competitor to the MC14783, but the linux kernel drivers use the same core driver source code for both chips The sony ONLY has the wm8350 on it  there is no MC14783 present.p  pThe code that I most want most desperately to understand how to make operate is found in the subdirectory wm8350, eg wm8350wm8350pmpowersupplysysfs.c.p  pI want the audio to fire up too, but m not quite sure where the pertinent audio amplifier code is yet...p  pVery clearly the wm8350pm code is designed to export a sys directory interface right now sys is mounted and operational on the system but Im not very familiar with the semantics of these newer style interfaces... they arent quite like the old APM power interfaces for Linux laptops...p  pFirst I checked the obvious If I do a cat syspowerstate  it returns the word mem and nothing else. The file has permissions coderwrrcode, so potentially it could be written  but I dont know with what.  The string mem does not exist anywhere in the source code for the wm8350pm drivers, so I dont even know if syspowerstate is part of the source code.p  pDoing a find sys iname emwm8350em reveals a handful of directories with the patterns  wm8350rtc , wm8350pmic , wm8350bl , wm8350power , wm8350led   wm8350hifidai , wm8350codec  wm8350imx32ads.0 p  pSo, I do an lsl on each directory, and look for actual files rather than symbolic links or subdirectories, and what I find are stock useless writable files  bind, unbind, uevent,p  pand a very few read only files pmicreg, dapmwidget, modalias, codecreg which arent very helpful.p  pIts no surprise thatp  pDoing cat sysdevicesplatformwm8350ebx5016audimodalias gives wm8350ebx5016audiop  pDoing cat sysdevicesplatformwm8350imx32ads.0modalias gives wm8350imx32adsp  pand since audio is off... Doing cat sysdevicesplatformwm8350ebx5016audidapmwidget reveals the audio statep  precodeHeadphone Jack Off Line In Jack On Mic Bias Off Left DAC Off Right DAC Off ... all else off and omitted except ... EBX5016hifi PM State D3hot codepre  pThe last two files, I expect should do wm8350 chip register dumps... and one did. Doing cat sysdeviceswm8350pmicpmicreg causes a long pause, then nothing is printed. but Doing cat sysdeviceswm8350platformwm8350ebx5016audiwm8350codeccodecreg does prints a list of registers up to e8 which is just a few bytes larger than the datasheet says the chip should be 0x00 to 0xe6.p  pI tried using a python program to play wav files, works on my desktop computer, and I noticed that devdsp does open, the mixers emDOem set volume levels, and nothing comes out.  So  the audio driver is not able to enable the sound amplifiers on its own automatically.p  pThere are no alsa sound files in dev, nor are any alsa tools found on the embedded machine... so I assume Sony is strictly using OSS devdsp and devmixer.p  pThere is only one other access point I can find to the ws8350 There emISem a device driver devwm8350.   p  pThat driver created by the source code in subdirectory wm8350wm8350reg.c   in theory it should be able to read and write to all registers using ioctls calls from a user space.  However, something appears grossly wrong with it, for I wrote a test program to read the wm8350 registers... and most of the registers return error messages rather than allowing to be read, including the most pulic ID registers 0x00, 0x01 etc.p  pSo, Im quite stuck.  Pointers, thoughts, hints, are quite desired.p
Negative 1912 pJust for my info because I tried to figure out last time even asked their support but unfortunately still no answer. p  pIts a simple problem I think but I cant wrap my head around. p  pLets say I have a object A,object B, object c. p  pI query to object A that has a pointer to object B. I get all the data back with include key and it works nice. But object B has also a pointer to object C. That data is empty. How can I get that pointer data too in the same query  p

Negative 1912 pI have 3 classes extending an abstract base class, all with the same formal structure.  They were all constructed and working properly with a HibernateSpring data harness and have been for a few months now in a production system.  However, Hibernate does not support discriminator column multitenancy out of the box, so I have been working on the transition to EclipseLink 2.5.2, which supposedly does.  p  pIve spent at least a day trying to get the following to work  and apologies if I cant list all of the configurations Ive tried in that time, as they were legion.  Im hoping that this present configuration will at least target whats wrong for someone more familiar with EclipseLink than I am.  Base class, minus accessors and constructorsp  precodeConverters     Convertername  UUIDConverter, converterClass  UUIDToStringConverter.class  MappedSuperclass Tablename  labeltypedefinitions Inheritancestrategy  InheritanceType.SINGLETABLE DiscriminatorColumnname  scope, columnDefinition  varchar20 not null public abstract class LabelTypeDefinition implements LabelType       Id     ConvertUUIDConverter     Columnname  id, length  40, columnDefinition  VARCHAR40     GeneratedValuegenerator  uuid     UuidGeneratorname  uuid     protected final UUID id     Columnname  name, nullable  false     protected String name     Columnname  description     protected String description  ...  codepre  pThe subclasses.  Treep  precodeEntity DiscriminatorValuevalue  TREE public class LabelTreeDefinition extends LabelTypeDefinition implements LabelTree      ....  codepre  pScenariop  precodeEntity DiscriminatorValuevalue  SCENARIO public class LabelScenarioDefinition extends LabelTypeDefinition implements LabelScenario      ...  codepre  pNodep  precodeEntity DiscriminatorValuevalue  NODE public class LabelNodeDefinition extends LabelTypeDefinition implements LabelNode      ...  codepre  pThe LabelType interface extends Serializable and my own Identifiable and describes the accessor contract for the model interfaces for models  not my design, a consequence of a separate Maven project for API baked in by my predecessor.  The interfaces LabelTreeNodeScenario all extend LabelType without adding to the contract.p  pThe problem when this configuration constructs my database, it ignores the table specification and does not build a scope column. p  precodeLABELTREEDEFINITION     id     name     description LABELNODEDEFINITION     id     name     description LABELSCENARIODEFINITION     id     name     description codepre  pTo me this means it is completely ignoring the Inheritance annotation and is doing so silently.  I can force it to build all of that in and make it look superficially correct by adding Table annotations to each subclass and including a scope column the latter was how it was built when using Hibernate, but then of course all of my Spring Data queries ignore the discriminator.p  pCould all of this be a consequence of implementing the different interfaces  If so, that worries me as it seems extremely fragile.

Negative 1912 pI recently encountered an interesting problem. I am developing with some existing code where, for better or worse, there are often several levels of prototypical inheritance ending in constructors for all kinds of various objects. Each of these ultimately inherit from a emsingleem base class. p  pEach constructor follows the following inheritance pattern, where codeSubcode is a subclass and codeSupercode is its immediate prototypep  precodefunction Subargs      Super.callthis,args   Sub.prototype  Object.createSuper.prototype codepre  pThis pattern continues all the way up to the single base class.p  pDiscovering that it would be incredibly beneficial for our needs to store a list of constructor names for each object up the prototype chain, I came up with the following code addition for the base class, which uses the codecalleecode and codecallercode properties of the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebJavaScriptReferenceFunctionsarguments relnofollowstrongargumentsstronga objectp  precodevar curConstructor  arguments.callee this.constructorList  [curConstructor.name]  whilecurConstructor.caller ampamp curConstructor.caller.name       curConstructor  curConstructor.caller     this.constructorList.pushcurConstructor.name  codepre  pThe main issue with this, is it emonlyem works if the object was constructed inside of an anonymous function or global scope. For instance, assuming I have a constructor codeSubA1codewith prototype codeSubAcodewith prototype codeBasecode, if I do thisp  precodefunction    var aOk  new SubA1   function oops      var aNotOk  new SubA1      oops  codepre  pcodeaOkcodes constructor list is code[Base,SubA,SubA1]code, which is what I want.p  pcodeaNotOkcodes constructor list ends up as code[Base,SubA,SubA1,oops]code.p  pa hrefhttpplnkr.coeditL74YDUt9jds7fn5PmkeS relnofollowstrongHeres a plunkerstronga.p  pI could fix it by having each constructor add their name to the constructor list themselves, but there are several problems with that, not least of which is the tremendous pain and debugging  maintenance nightmare it would be to add code to each of the many many constructor functions.p  pIs there an elegant way to achieve thisp  pNote that although the above question was asked in a more general sense, and not specific to Node.js, I am actually working with code in a Node.js environment. Therefore, solutions specific to Node are welcome.p  h2Updateh2  pIn my particular case, all of the constructors are within a namespace. So I can actually solve the problem by performing a check to make sure that the function name exists in the namespace before adding it to the codeconstructorListcode. p  pBasically, I can do thisp  precodevar curConstructor  arguments.callee this.constructorList  [curConstructor.name]  whilecurConstructor.caller     curConstructor  curConstructor.caller       Exit if the function name isnt part of the namespace     iftypeof namespace[curConstructor.name]  function break      this.constructorList.pushcurConstructor.name  codepre  pThis wont solve it in a generic sense though of course, and it isnt perfect. If the function which calls codenew SubA1code for example just happens to have the same name as one of the constructors in the namespace, it will throw the list off. In my particular case, since the constructors follow a unique naming pattern, that occurrence is extremely unlikely.p  pI am aware that codearguments.calleecode is deprecated, and that codeObject.constructorcode is not trustworthy it doesnt get me what I want anyway, but I am unaware of any other way to get names of each constructor in the chain by modifying the base class only.p

Negative 1912 pIve been trying to run a simple linear model in R using codeX lt lmY.,datamydatacode, but I keep running into the error codecannot allocate vector of size 124.0 Mbcode.  Ive looked online for solutions but most of them seem to say its an issue with R and something substantial like a hardware upgrade would be required.  p  pI tried codememory.limit5000code in order to see what would happen when I more than doubled my existing memory limit, but the same error came up.

Negative 1912 pThe page I am developing requires that there be two lists, one of which to add items to and then order those items. I am using Jquery plugin called nestable where you can drag and drop list items. it works fine when there are items prepopulated in the list, but when i make an empty list i cannot drag items onto it. I have tried using the ddempty class everywhere divs in different locations the ol class, the li class and nothing seems to work completely. The closest thing that works is setting the ol class to ddempty. it creates an empty slot which i can drag one item to, however it does not allow me to drag anymore items or drag that item back to the original list.p  pAm i doing something wrong maybe in my CSS or is this just a bug that nestable hasp  pLet me know if you have any questions or need to see my code.p

Negative 1912 pI have a table with approximately 300 000 rows in DynamoDB. It contains three columns source, data and cycles. The source attribute is a hash key and data is a range key. The cycles attribute is a number which is added by the application each time a row is to be added. I used to scan these rows with the following filterp  precode     TableName tableName,     Limit 20,     ScanFilter          cycles              AttributeValueList [                                      N 0                              ],             ComparisonOperator EQ                codepre  pHowever, this scanfilter spontaneously seems to have decided not to work properly anymore. Anytime I execute this request it will return zero results. When I remove the scanfilter it returns 20 results, so I assume it has nothing to do with the limit or tableName attributes. The funny thing is that when I set the filter to find items with cycles equals 1 it actually works, maybe because there are 10 rows with cycles  1 at the start of the table.p  pMy question is simply how to fix this. Should I add a new index, or should I change this scanfilter I can also try to use the query command instead of scan, but my previous attempts to do this didnt work out either.p

Negative 1912 pI am searching everywhere and havent been able to locate a suitable example and am not well versed enough to be able to sort it out via the docs.

Negative 1912 pI have a scenario, where I load data from large files, e.g. json and I would like to keep the memory usage as low as possible. The other problem is that I would like to encapsulate the data loading from the processing part, so I can also implement an importer for xml for example.p  pIf the data contains only a simple list it is quite easy, I can define an interface like thisp  precodeinterface IImporter      IEnumerableltDatagt LoadFromStream stream  codepre  pAnd then I can implement it using the yield keywordp  precodeclass JsonImporter  IImporter      public IEnumerableltDatagt LoadFromStream stream              JsonReader reader  ...         ...         while ...                      yield return new Datareader.Read...                codepre  pThe advantage is that the memory impact is very low, if the JsonReader works efficiently only one Data object is in memory depending on the processing. The negative side is that you cannot iterate over the enumerable twice depending on the situation.p  pBut what happens if there is more complex data, e.g. first a header with some simple properties in json and then two array with totally different structure In this case an IEnumerable does not work anymore. Do you have some patterns here or is there a framework for this. I think also about buffering and how the consumer can notify the producer that processing has been finished, so the stream or the sql connection, ... can be closed and disposed. Looking for some ideas.p

Negative 1912 pIm having a lot of trouble figuring out how to use the Yii2 stack trace to diagnose problems. Specifically, I can rarely find the source of the problem in my code based on what the trace tells me. Im sure its just me being obtuse, so Im hoping someone can help me on this.

Negative 1912 pTarget platform Android, OpenGL ES 2.0p  pAt the beginning of the scene I upload my texture with codeglTexImage2Dcode, so they are supposed to be right from the beginning available before the actual rendering starts. AFAIK calls to glTexImage2D are very time consuming, because the image data is basically memcopied.p  pLater on I will use the texture, so I call codeglBindTexturecode again, to be able to render it. And here comes the funny part The first time I call codeglBindTexturecode and actually render the texture the applications framerate drops significantly a couple times but then stabilizes again fully. It seems like the video driver is rearranging memory when the texture is actually used for the first time Maybe some textures that were previously in RAM are moved to hard disk in order to make space for the texture That would definietly make sense if there was a mechanism that keeps track when a texture was used the last time and then removes the textures from memory that werent used for a specific amount of time to make space. p  pAny ideas on this behavior and maybe a way to force the driver to instantly make space before the actual rendering startsp

Negative 1912 pAlright, so Ive made a basic program that, so far, just makes a point in 3d space, renders it to a 2d screen, and rotates the camera. Rotating on the Z axis works just fine, on the X axis works basically fine, but the motion speeds up as the point gets closer to the edge of the screen, but I think thats just because of the perspective. The weird thing is, when I try to rotate along the Y axis, instead of the point appearing to move to the leftright, it moves diagonally, which isnt what I intended.p  pBelow is a link to a .rar file containing the Java project, please ignore the codeWorldcodeand codeFaceTricode classes. codeExecode is the main class.p  pDownload the project a hrefhttpswww.mediafire.comzyfjrc613vmmi42 relnofollowherea. Please tell me if you can figure out why incrementing the Y Euler Angle causes the point to appear to move diagonally.p

Negative 1912 pBACKGROUND My company is acting as the SP to our clients that are the IDP. We use OpenAM, but our clients use ADFS or Shibboleth. We exchange metadata files for establishing federations, not URLS. A client asked why we require an AuthnContext class schema specifically PasswordProtectedTransport, and not only do we not know why, we dont know how to change it or what that would mean.p  pQUESTION What is the functional difference between using PasswordProtectedTransport vs unspecified for the AuthnContextClassRef in a SAML2 assertion p  pWe currently use PasswordProtectedTransport amongst all our clients, but no one at my company can tell me why we require this. If we remove it, the federation stops working with a 500 errror and a NoAuthnContext in the SAML trace. We also dont understand that, as I was led to believe from saml documentation that having a schema is optional for the authentication. Even so, I saw no explanation anywhere of what the implications of using unspecified would be.p  pI cant find any thorough explanation or discussion anywhere about this topic and was hoping someone could elaborate for me, as I am struggling to find light on this.p

and difference in understanding.p  pWe use a hrefhttpsmaven.apache.orgguidesintroductionintroductiontodependencymechanism.htmlDependencyScope relnofollowmaven scopesa to decide which dependencies should be available and when. Usually with tests, we use codeltscopegttestltscopegtcode to make the dependency available only in test and not in final application jar when bundled.   p  pNow if we make use of this kind of testsExpecting Log Messages, we need to remove codeltscopegttestltscopegtcode to let the application run correctly and tests pass at the same time. Which means that that dependency akkatestkit need to be present in the final jar as well since emapplication.confem needs it to load codeakka.testkit.TestEventListenercode.  p  pThis if all sounds correct, couples production and test code together and is required in current setup.  p  pAgain, I may have missed something very basic here, but the only way I could run the application and let the test pass is by combining  the dependencies codeakkaactorcode and codeakkatestkit togethercode.  p  pWhat are your thoughtsp

While codeheadtailcode is very efficient, since its just a cons of an existing list, creating a new copy of codeTrackcode seems less efficient.p  pThe alternative is to explicitly pass all values that will make up a track, so that recursion just changes function parametersp  precodedef scanTracksreader Stream[Frame] List[Track]       def scanTracks2reader2 Stream[Frame], id Int, count Int, start Double, end Double, acc List[Track] List[Track]      if reader2.isEmpty       Trackid, count  1, start, end  acc     else        val frame  reader2.head       frame.trackId match          case 1 gt scanTracks2reader2.tail, frame.trackId, 1, frame.time, 0, acc         case x if x  id gt scanTracks2reader2.tail, id, count  1, start, frame.time, acc         case  gt           scanTracks2             reader2.tail,             frame.trackId,             1,             frame.time,             0,             Trackid, count  1, start, end  acc                          scanTracks2reader, 1, 0, 0, 0, Nil  codepre  pThis muddies the function signature and has the emkludgeem of using code1code as a marker of emno track yetem. Overall, I feel that readability has degraded a good bit.p  pMy question is whether my concern about codecopycode efficiency is unreasonable in the overall scheme or whether there is yet another pattern for doing this multistage accumulation that is better than both of these.p

Negative 1912 pSo Ive got PageSpeed on top of Nginx serving a pretty simple Wordpress install.p  pThis problem seemed to coincide with upgrading to Wordpress 4.2.2 however, after downgrading to 4.1.5 to see if this was the issue, it turned out not to be the case.p  pNormally I wouldnt blame PageSpeed, but using PageSpeedoff in the URL fixes the issue completely. And just to be clear  theres no cache in the admin area.p  pAnother odd thing is that it only seems to effect Pages as opposed to Posts in the CMS, so it seems like PageSpeed might have some conflict with scriptsstylessomething specific to Pages.p  pI am currently baffled, so any suggestions are appreciated.p

Negative 1912 pLets say I have two GUI buttons with EventTrigger as virtual key. The expectation is whenever a button is pressed, the camera will rotate until the button is released. p  pAt the beginning, I used the pointer Down and pointer up function. It works, but it extremely sensitive, the camera rotation didnt stop at the moment when I release my finger. Ive solved this problem by using drag function whenever dragging is detected, the camera stop rotating something like that. p  pHowever, there is still a bug that I couldnt solve, that is if I swipe the button instead of touchamprelease, the button doesnt release. eventually the camera just keep rotating until I touch the button again. Ive tried all the event trigger function such as pointer exist, end drag etc.  I just want the touch input works as perfectly as the keyboard input.p  pThis problem doesnt shown when I debugging on unity remote, only when I build it on my phone. So is that hardware issue Im using mi3p  pThanks for having time to read my broken English.p

Negative 1912 pAccording to a hrefhttpstools.ietf.orghtmlrfc5246 relnofollowRFC 5246a which defines TLS protocol version 1.2p  pPage 18p  blockquote   pThe record layer fragments information blocks into TLSPlaintext       records carrying data in chunks of 214 bytes or less.  Client       message boundaries are not preserved in the record layer i.e.,       multiple client messages of the same ContentType MAY be coalesced       into a single TLSPlaintext record, or a single message MAY be       fragmented across several records.p blockquote  pOn page 40 it saysp  blockquote   pTLS allows extensions to follow the compressionmethods field in an       extensions block.  The presence of extensions can be detected by       determining whether there are bytes following the compressionmethods       at the end of the ClientHello.  Note that this method of detecting       optional data differs from the normal TLS method of having a       variablelength field, but it is used for compatibility with TLS       before extensions were defined.p blockquote  pWhat I understand from this passage is when Im done parsing a codeClientHellocode message, I should compare its size to the codeTlsPlaintext.lengthcode field of the encapsulating record layer message to see if there are any extra bytes at the end of record layer messsage, and if there are, interpret them as codeExtensioncode structures.p  pThis actually works correctly for some of TLS traffic samples that I test my app with, but fails for some other i.e. it fails to detect messages that wireshark can. When I look at the problematic packet using wireshark, It looks like several handshake messages combined into a single handshake message. These are a codeServerHellocode which looks exactly like codeClientHellocode with extensions present, a codeCertificatecode and codeServerHelloDonecode message.p  pDetecting Hello extensions is easy when Hello message is encapsulated inside a single handshake message, but I cant understand how is it possible to detect presence and boundaries of extension part after a hello message when there exist other handshake messages in the same message after them.p  pAny help or suggestion on how to parse these packets would be appreciated.p

This criteria is the same for each document. The number is 5.11. I have 4 other documents just like this that will also return number values which are 10.77, 18.19, 15.78, and 7.91. These numbers need to be compiled into a list in Excel. Over time the number of documents will increase so the list needs to be dynamic in the sense that it can automatically retrieve the number values in those new documents and add them to the list which is capable of holding a constantly changing amount of numbers. These numbers cannot be hardcoded either, they need to be referenced from the document.p  pWhy dont you just manually put them in yourself Yeah I know I can do that but this is really just a metaphor for what I really need to do. I need to make a small scale model of the real project to get the concept down and then Ill expand it to full size once I understand it fully. Im also not asking you to write the code for me, that way I wont learn anything. If you do write any code, please explain what each element does. Other than that, I need a detailed point in the right direction. Are there programs other than Excel I need Can I do this with Excel andor HTML only What arguments and functions should I be aware of Is an FTP necessaryp  pSorry for the long post, but this I figured the more detailed the better.

But on device, it seems like the next timer is not set until the app is back to foreground from background.p  pIm not sure why this difference happens, and struggling to solve this.p  pAnd I have another concern with this problem. As Apple says, background executions are only available in music playing, downloading, etc. So Im afraid that my implementation way abovecontinuing countingdown and updating NSLabel in background might be prohibited and Apple will reject it from appreview. If so, is there any good alternative implementation ways to avoid thisp  pYour thoughts and help will be hugely appreciated. p

Negative 1912 pI am working with an application that needs to desearlize 1000s of objects per second, validate them against a postgres database and then reserialize the data to be sent to the next process using SQS.

Negative 1912 pIve been learning how Linked Lists work,and started building an implementation in C to reinforce the concepts. It was going well until I made a function to remove all nodes. I figured out a solution which is the commented code but I cant seem to figure out why the other code didnt work. p  pThe Node object is an instance of a class that was created using new. Therefore delete is used to, well, delete it.p  pI thought it may have been related to deleting the object and reusing the pointer variable. Then I came across this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions23621677whathappenstothepointeritselfafterdeleteWhat happens to a pointer itself after deletea  Ive been staring at it for a while trying to figure out what it could be, and nothing I have researched seems to be providing an answer. p  pI dont believe it is something with my implementation so far because the programs works as expected when replacing the code with the solution code. p  pThe code outputs every address, but it doesnt seem to actually delete the object. If I run the program in Windows, the program will actually lock and never leave the while loop. Not an infinite loop, it just gets stuck and the function never finishes. If I run it on C4Droid the program doesnt lock, but the nodes still exist after the function exits. p  pSo my question is, why doesnt the current code work Ignore the commented code. That is a working solution. Is there something simple Im overlooking with pointer variables Thank you in advance. p  precodevoid LinkedListdeleteAll  Node pCurrent  pHead  whilepCurrent     Node pNext  pCurrentgtpNext     stdcout ltlt pCurrent ltlt stdendl     delete pCurrent     pCurrent  nullptr     pCurrent  pNext    pHead  pHeadgtpNext   delete pCurrent   pCurrent  pHead   codepre  pNode class p  precodeclass  Node     public         Nodestring contentdatacontent         string getData             return data                  Node pNext  nullptr     private         string data      codepre  pLinkedList.hp  precode   LinkedList.h      Created on Oct 3, 2015        Author Anthony    ifndef LINKEDLISTH define LINKEDLISTH  includeltstringgt using stdstring  class LinkedList  public     LinkedList     virtual LinkedList     int length     void addNodestring nodeContent     void deleteNodestring nodeContent     void deleteAll private     class  Node     public         Nodestring contentdatacontent         string getData             return data                  Node pNext  nullptr     private         string data           Node pHead  nullptr    endif  LINKEDLISTH  codepre  pLinkedList.cppp  precode       LinkedList.cpp      Created on Oct 3, 2015        Author Anthony    include LinkedList.h include ltiostreamgt LinkedListLinkedList       TODO Autogenerated constructor stub    LinkedListLinkedList       TODO Autogenerated destructor stub   int LinkedListlength      Node current  pHead     int count  0     whilecurrent         count         current  currentgtpNext          return count   void LinkedListaddNodestdstring nodeContent      Node newNode  new NodenodeContent     newNodegtpNext  pHead     pHead  newNode   void LinkedListdeleteNodestdstring nodeContent    void LinkedListdeleteAll      Node pCurrent  pHead      whilepCurrent         Node pNext  pCurrentgtpNext         stdcout ltlt pCurrentgtpNext ltlt stdendl         delete pCurrent         pCurrent  nullptr         pCurrent  pNext        pHead  pHeadgtpNext       delete pCurrent       pCurrent  pHead       codepre  pmain.cppp  precode   main.cpp      Created on Oct 3, 2015        Author Anthony    includeltiostreamgt include LinkedList.h  int mainint argc, char argv      using namespace std      LinkedList list  LinkedList     list.addNodestringTest     list.addNodestringTest1      list.deleteAll     cout ltlt list.length ltlt endl      return 0  codepre
