Positive 2859 pOne of our systems is build as a wrapper around a third party customized work flow product that we cannot change.p  pRecently we got a request to capture some user activity data which is persisted nowhere else than in the application logs. These logs files are quite a few spreading across multiple machines so analyzing those logs to extract the required info would be a relatively complex task. p  pCreating some aspects to audit those user actions was considered but was quickly ran out giving the amount of third party code you need to decompile and look at. There will also be security restrictions about activating loadtime weaving on production application servers.p  pMy initial idea was to redirect the log outputs we are interested in to a different file actually files and then analyze those files to process that data. This seems doable but when you start considering things you soon find a lot of issues to deal with when working with files logs rollover, no transactions, keeping a track of what was processed and what not, etc.p  pMy second thought was to implement a custom pattern layout and configure it to be used for the logs I was interested in. Easy to write, keeping it away from third party code in addition to sending the message to the log file will also save the log entry into a table. Once in the table I can do everything I want starting from there.

However the actual codeformatcode method never gets invoked and consequently I get nothing saved in my table.

I admit that was a standalone java application as opposed to this one which is running on a webshere application server.p  pAny idea about what would cause this and how to address it Alternative approach that will do the job without involving lots of technologiesp  pThank you in advance for your inputs.p

Positive 2859 pAccording to a hrefhttpwww.slf4j.orgcodes.htmlsubstituteLogger relnofollowthis FAQa, it is possible to use logging before the logger is initialized, and slf4j will use a codeNOPLoggercode that just does nothing with the message.p  pIs there a way to wait until SLF4J implementation, particularly log4j, is fully initialized and ready to write the logs I need that to make sure that codeNOPLoggercode is not used.p
Positive 2859 pIm using the JOOQ library to generate and perform SQL queries. For debugging reasons I want to see what queries exactly are performed without looking at the changing database every time. I think the jooq framework should show lots of informations about queries and their effects if the log level is set to debug. I use log4j2 for logging, and it is set to debug using the following configurationp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltconfiguration statusDEBUG packagesch.fhnw.ima.doggaitgt     ltappendersgt         ltConsole nameConsole targetSYSTEMOUTgt             ltPatternLayout patterndHHmmss.SSS [t] 5level logger36  msgngt         ltConsolegt     ltappendersgt      ltloggersgt         ltroot levelDEBUGgt             ltappenderref refConsolegt         ltrootgt     ltloggersgt ltconfigurationgt codepre  pUnfortunally It looks like JOOQ uses another logger, which is set to info.

Positive 2859 pN.B. While I have not managed to work out the final solution to the issue, with some help from Andreas I was able to realise that I had configured log4j incorrectly and it was using a default properties file and not the one that I specified myself. I will post the solution when I have it working properly so that it is available for people in the future... right after octoberfest this weekend Dp  pOkay, so I know that similar questions have been asked on here, however I have yet to find a post that has this same problem or a solution to fix it.p  pOkay, so I tried to start using log4j to try and get used to proper logging with my code yay best practices but I ran into a bit of an issue while trying to fix an error in my code. The problem is that I need to read the console output, but log4j is putting everything there DEBUG. At first this wasnt a problem so I didnt bother to get log4j to stop doing it. But now I am finding it quite hard to look for the information that I need in the output.p  pAs a quick solution to my problem, I tried to programmatically change the logging level to OFF on both my loggers, nope.p  pThen I tried to change the properties file to prevent it writing to the console, nope.p  pThen I tried to remove everything in the properties file thinking that log4j would no longer know how to behave, nope.p  pThen I tried to completely remove log4j from my code by commenting out all of the lines and not initialising any loggers, nope... wait, whatp  pYep, it seems that even without any log4j code in my project, log4j just does not want to stop.p  pAt this point I tried to clean the project Im using eclipse, then I tried to restart eclipse, and then my laptop.p  pI know that I am probably making a massive oversight, but I feel like commenting out ALL OF THE CODE  would do something.p  pI should note that NOTHING I tried made any difference to the content being printed, it always printed the same lines in the same order hence why I am sure that I am doing something wrongp  pAny help that can be offered would be greatly appreciatedp  pEDIT 1 I should also state that the reason that I think it is log4j causing the issue is that all of the output in the console is taking the format that I defined in the log4j.properties file.p  pEDIT 2 p  pone classp

Positive 2859 pI have a web application, which uses log4j and slf4j as facade for logging. Logging is configured not from log4j.properties file, but from Java code. Application is running on three different machines using Websphere Application Server.p  pIssue is that on two instances logging works as expected. But on the third one nothing is written in my logfile. Output goes to SystemErr.log instead there are messages of ERROR and INFO levels.p  pInitially I thought that something is with Websphere server configuration, but later I found this link a hrefhttpwww.webagesolutions.comknowledgebasewaskbwaskb004 relnofollowhttpwww.webagesolutions.comknowledgebasewaskbwaskb004a which says that such situation can be when log4j.properties can not be read.p  pBut I am not using property file for this. And configuration form Java works OK on other two instances. Any ideas what can be the issuep  pThank you in advancep

Positive 2859 pIm having some trouble configuring proper logging in Eclipse Scout framework. My claims arent that high as I only want to be able to set different log levels for different parts of my program in a configurationpropertiesXML file. The logging configuration in the config.ini of my Scout server plugin currently looks like thisp  precodeeclipse.consoleLogtrue org.eclipse.scout.logeclipse org.eclipse.scout.log.levelINFO codepre  pSo as you can see this is the default logging configuration using Eclipse logging. It works fine for logging at a global level. The only thing I would like to do is to write something like this to set the different log levelsp  precodepackagename.ClassNameLOGLEVEL codepre  pAs this is a very basic logging use case I think there must be some easy way to do this in Scout. Otherwise I would appreciate some help how to configure log4j, JUL or others for the use with Scout. The a hrefhttpswiki.eclipse.orgScoutConceptsLogging relnofollow titleEclipse Scout WikiEclipse Scout Wikia hasnt helped me so far. I created the example logger fragment to the host plugin org.eclipse.scout.commons and removed the logging configuration lines from my config.ini but nothing happens. Im also not sure where to put the log4j.poperties or how this is done otherwise.p  pIm a bit ashamed for being unable to figure out such a basic problem, but would be very happy about some quick help.p

Positive 2859 pI would like to see Log4j output in the console only when a given test has failed.

Negative 2859 pIm not a DBA so this may be a stupid question but Ill ask it anyway.  Were upgrading our SQL Servers from 2000 to 2005 and we will probably use either database replication or database mirroring.  Our DBA would like to multipurpose the standby server meaning that hed like to increase our capabilities and capacity by running other database applications on the standby server since its just going to be sitting there anyway his words, not mine.  Is this such a good idea  Right now, our main application server uses only one instance that contains 50 databases.  As I understand it, what were doing now and what our DBA is proposing for a failover server is a bad idea because all of these databases are sharing memory, CPUs, and working areas.  If one applications starts behaving badly, the other DBs could be affected.p  pAny thoughtsp

Negative 2859 pWe have a website that we would like to extrapolate user controls from and put them into an assembly of their own.  This is so we can more easily reuse these controls in other similar projects.  I think we can do this fairly easily by creating a new class library project, moving the .ascx and .ascx.cs files over to this project, adding the appropriate .net assembly references, and modifying our projects references to these user controls to pull them from the library.p  pThe problem Im foreseeing at this point is that these controls are heavily dependent on a certain database schema.  Historically, we have always kept our connection strings in the web.config, and have been using LINQ to SQL for our database management, so I am having trouble conjuring up a bestpractices way to share database connection information in the web.config with the assembly.  The only way I could think of doing it is to add a ConnectionString property to each of my user controls, and on PageLoad, set the ConnectionString property which will in turn create an instance of the data context using that connection string.  However, I was hoping to instead accomplish one of the followingp  ul liSomehow have the assembly pull the connection string directly from the web.config.  Since the assembly is not a web application, I obviously cant just call ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[connection].  Is this possibleli liLess likely, but figure out a way to set the connection string once on application start and have each instance of my user controls somehow reuse this.  I would think there would be a way to cache this value for reuse by the assembly, but I cant think of a way to do it.li ul  pAny suggestions are greatly appreciated.p

Not with Ctrlscrolling tiltwheel mousewheel, but by pushing the mousewheel to the left or the right.p  pFirst I tried it by catching the WMMOUSEHWHEEL 0x020E message in WndProc, but this fires only once and I want to keep on moving left or right as long as I push.p  pI used Spy to check the messages of my control, but found nothing usefull  I checked the same on a Richtextbox and notepad and it seems that there is another message that fires  WMHSCROLL 0x0114.p  pThe richtextbox doesnt scroll horizontally by pushing the wheel left or right, but I can catch the WMHSCROLL in the WndProc function.

Negative 2859 pI am working with a very large 11GB text file on a Linux system.  I am running it through a program which is checking the file for errors.  Once an error is found, I need to either fix the line or remove the line entirely.  And then repeat...p  pEventually once Im comfortable with the process, Ill automate it entirely.  For now however, lets assume Im running this by hand.p  pWhat would be the fastest in terms of execution time way to remove a specific line from this large file  I thought of doing it in Python...but would be open to other examples.  The line might be emanywhereem in the file.p  pIf Python, assume the following interfacep  pcodedef removeLinefilename, linenocodep  pThanks,p  pajp
Negative 2859 pSorry for the long explanation. Thanks in advance to all who are taking their time.p  pI am an Ubuntu user who has set up Titanium Developer on a MacMini in order to build an app for the iPhone and ultimately some other platforms.p  pRather than having any local code built in, the app simply points to my website. To do that, all I needed to do was change Titaniums strongtiapp.xmlstrong file to include my website URL. I wrote no other code, nor did I need to include any other files. It simply compiled and ran in the emulator without a hitch.p  pIve got just one problem I need to upload files to my website and Apple, as most of you know, has disabled the input field typefile. Ive got it working in all other browsers. The  action simply calls a php file and passes the file info.p  pemIfem I didnt have an app, and someone was just manually navigating to my site with the iPhones Safari browser, I could get around the problem by using CliqCliq, which is a very cool iPhone app. Basically, I use JavaScript window.open to launch CliqCliqs QuickPic browser in a second Safari window. The user chooses a file QuickPic uploads it and the user is returned to the second Safari window that I launched with window.open. The user closes the window and Safari returns them to the first window i.e., my website. p  pThe problem is that my website is being shown in my app. By the way, I dont have my developer license yet, even though I signed up a few weeks ago, and I cant test this in the emulator because I cant install QuickPic into it, I assume. I wanted to repeat the same steps, described in the previous paragraph, using an iFrame but that didnt seem to work i.e., the iFrame was blank despite my designating a src. I also tried having a hidden window by using oldfashioned frames and setting the colwidth to 0. That also did not work i.e., Safari, if I recall correctly, opened a separate window.p  pIm working a little blind, since I cant test anything on the iPhone, but I figure I have two options I can either find a way to launch a QuickPic in an iFrame or I can find some way to incorporate the Apple toolkit file chooser into the Titanium app. p  pThe problem with the first option  but again, I dont know until I can try this on the iPhone  is that I assume both apps mine and CliqCliqs could not run at the same time. Even if I had a hidden window, invisible iFrame, etc., the moment it launches QuickPic, I assume my app would quit.p  pThe problem with the second option is that I dont have clue as to how to incorporate a file picker into my app by using Titanium keeping in mind, everyone, that I know very little. Brian at CliqCliq has even offered to give me some code if I cant make Apples file picker work but again, Im not sure what to do next.p  pWhat do you folks think Whats the best method And, whats the easiest thing for a simpleton to dop  pThanks.p

Negative 2859 pI am looking for a way of programmatically testing a script written with the codeasyncorecode Python module. My test consists of launching the script in question  if a TCP listen socket is opened, the test passes. Otherwise, if the script dies before getting to that point, the test fails.p  pThe purpose of this is knowing if a nightly build works at least up to a point or not. p  pI was thinking the best way to test would be to launch the script in some kind of sandbox wrapper which waits for a socket request. I dont care about actually listening for anything on that port, just intercepting the request and using that as an indication that my test passed.p  pI think it would be preferable to intercept the open socket request, rather than polling at set intervals I hate polling. But Im a bit out of my depths as far as how exactly to do this.p  pCan I do this with a shell script Or perhaps I need to override the asyncore module at the Python levelp  pThanks in advance,br  Bp

Negative 2859 pI have a little problem with my UITableViewController or NSFetchedResultsController. I am not sure which is the problem soure but I guess its the UITableViewController.p  pAs I said I use a NSFetchedResultsController to fill my data into a  UITableViewController. The data is sorted by date and is also displayed in sections by dateyear, e.g. May 2010June 2010 and so on. This is displayed as the section header. p  pNow when I add new data, it automatically uses the current date as default, but if I want to use a date, that is currently not in the section list, e.g. April 2010 currently May and June in the list, then this is not displayed correctly. Only when I quit the app and start it again it will show the new section headers and everything is fine. p  pSo I somehow need to be able to refresh my list or update it. By just adding it to the context and changing it does not seem to update it.p  pAgain, I am not sure what I need to update, if it is my NSFetchedResultsController object or the UITableViewController.p  pUPDATE 1p  pI just figured that there is an exception in this method p  precode voidcontrollerDidChangeContentNSFetchedResultsController controller        The fetch controller has sent all current change notifications, so tell the table view to process all updates.

Negative 2859 pOk, I know it is best practice that once you change or remove a page URL, to redirect that url to the new relevant URL.p  pBut for how long foreverp  pFor example, I am using Google website optimizer to test different variations of a page. So I have to create a different url for each like original.php, var1.php, var2.php, etc.p  ponce the test is done, the winner will become the new original.php and there will be no need to keep var1.php, etc. But I now need to redirect those no longer needed URLs to the relevant original.php.p  pThis can end up being a ALOT of 301 redirects in my code.htaccesscode file. I also have heard that the more stuff you have in your .htaccess file the slower your site becomes because the server has to process everything in it before it can serve a page.p  pI can move the redirects to the actual URLs example a php redirect on the actual var1.php file but then I have several unneeded files bloating up my server.p  pSo I am wondering whats the best practice here is it safe to remove a 301 redirect after so longp

Negative 2859 pIm developing with Grails.  Since the framework will bootstrap data and a fully flushed out spring context, I find that I write a lot of integration tests for services.  Let me rephrase that  I find I write no unit tests for services, only integration tests.  Is this a bad idea  The only downside I see to it is that my tests take a bit longer to run.  p  pI do use unit testing on controllers, as in a controller I am testing the various application flows, result types, redirect logic, etc.  But the majority of tests I write are integration tests.  This seems a break from tradition J2EE tests, where mostly unit tests are written.  p  pedit to be clear, Im not writing integration tests because the code is so complicated only integration tests will do.  Im writing integration tests because it is easier to test everything together, since the framework gives you so much.  I do mock certain things, like if a service collaborates with the acegi authenticationService, I mock that.  I also mock anytime we interact with a webservice, because you have to in order to get a test that runs without special setup.  p

Before that, the explanation of property vs function as is vs does felt arbitrary.

If my property talks to a database to store the is value, it breaks in horrible ways.p
Negative 2859 pIm using Core Data  sqlite as a data cache. The app reads in a file into core data, then uses Core Data to run the app. Saves are done to both the NSManagedObjectContext and to the file.

Negative 2859 pI have recently put together a JWS application which gets its argument from a dynamically created JNLP file details can be found a hrefhttpforums.oracle.comforumsmessage.jspamessageID8396815 relnofollowherea.

Say after login the user does A, B, C and D tasks each of which are sent to the server as a POST request. So instead of having A.php, B.php, C.php and D.php I would like to have a single code.php and have A, B, C and D as functions. Is there a way to do thisp  pAlso on the same note, how do I deal with say a global array e.g. an array of currently logged in users across multiple forms I want to do this without writing to a DB. I know its probably better to write to a DB and query but is it even possible to do it with a global array The reason I was thinking about having all the form functions in one file is to use a global array. p  pThanks,  Pavp

Negative 2859 pOk, we have a page. A very simple one. Lets call it codepage.phpcode. It will have a controller and a view. The controller will just catch up some GET variables and print them out in the beginning of that page, the view will show up an header a footer and a paragraph that will contain the GET variables from the controller.p  pNow lets imagine we want to add a calendar. You think its good and easy. Well, it seems not at all to me.p  pThe calendar is made up of codelttablegtlttbodygtXlttbodygtlttablegtcode which is pure HTML and a logic PHP script that will fill the codeXcode that will create based on the codetimecodestamp of the current date and time the month dates and and numbers.p  pNow I encounter an ethic problem How could I divide logic and view of that calendar p  pThe block of code that will create the dates will print codelttdgtcode and codelttrgtcode elaborating the codetimecode.

My Solrhome ist defined somewhere on my hard drive through JNDI. For some reason Solr creates on startup a new folder of solr inside of Tomcats Webapps folder with the lib files and the index. That alone would make me think that I somehow defined Solrhome wrong but Solr is using the schema and config out of the real Solrhome. I just cant get any sense into that. Is that how Solr works or can anyone give me a hint on how I can force Solr to saving the index into my defined Solrhome p
Negative 2859 pIn most browsers, when an html element is only partially opaque, its children inherit this opacity.  It isnt quite inheritancemore correctly, the entire image is assembled, including the parent and its children recursively, and then the opacity is applied to the entire thing.  p  pIn IE8 and I would assume also for earlier versions of IE, this is not always what happens with opacity.  If the child elements have positionstatic the default if no position is specified, then it does work as I described above.  However, it appears to be the case that, if the position is set to anything else e.g., absolute, or relative, then the child element is fully opaque.  p  pI want to know how to make the opacity correctly affect both the parent and the child elements but still keep the child element with positionabsolutep  pHere is an example of the problem.  The following code is supposed to make a translucent gray box with a translucent blue surrounding area, on top of a vertical red bar.  On Firefox, Chrome, etc., This is what is actually seen.  On IE8, the blue box is correctly translucent, but the gray part is opaque.  p  precodeltdoctype htmlgt lthtmlgt   ltheadgt     ltstylegt       div.parentElem                backgroundcolor0000ff         position absolute         left75px         top75px         width300px         height225px                 opacity0.5         filteralphaopacity50              div.childElem                backgroundcolor808080         position absolute         left 10px         right 10px         top 10px         bottom 10px              div.redBar                position absolute         left150px         top50px         height350px         width25px         backgroundcolor ff0000                    ltstylegt   ltheadgt   ltbodygt     ltdiv classredBargtltdivgt     ltdiv classparentElemgt       ltdiv classchildElemgtltdivgt     ltdivgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pObviously, this is just a toy exampleI could have had a single div with a blue border and a gray background to achieve the desired effect.  In the real scenario, I am layering several different divs, each of which has a png background image to dynamically build an image.  p  pMy first attempted workaround was to apply opacity to both the parent and the child, either by setting the filter on the child to alphaopacity50 or simply setting filterinherit.  This does not achieve the desired result because it makes a translucent blue rectangle with a translucent gray rectangle on top of it.  The empty space in the middle ends up being translucent blueish gray whereas it should be translucent gray.  Similarly, it does not work to make the elements siblings.  Any solution needs to compose the two images before applying any transparency to anything.p  pIn my research, I found some suggestions that applying either zoom1 or floatnone to the inner element might resolve the issue, but neither worked for me.p  pMy eventual workaround was to give the child element positionstatic.  Its kind of an ugly solution, but what I would do to apply it to the above example is change the style of the child element to look likep  precode  div.childElem        backgroundcolor808080     positionstatic     marginleft10px      marginright10px     height205px     margintop10px    codepre  pIts kind of an ugly solution because it means that I have to know the height of the object.  Also, in the real case where I am composing several different pngs, and I would like them to be logical siblings, I have to put them all in a nested parentchildgrandchildetc. relationship.  It also prevents me from adding any textual elements except on the very top of the stack the innermost div without messing up the positioning.  It does work, though, and it looks the same in all browsers.p  pIs there any way to avoid such a horrid workaround and have opacity correctly affect the child elements without making the position static  Thanksp

Negative 2859 pIm having a strange problem with SQL Server 2008, in which some datetime variables within stored procedures are getting incorrect values 17540101. Here is the backgroundcontext of the situationp  pIm working on an ASP.NET web application using the SqlMembershipProvider class. I use the outofbox functionality for storing user data in the database, validating usernamespasswords, etc. Our application also has a custom esignature implementation that requires authenticating the user with some additional information mothers maiden name, graduation year, etc..p  pI do this authentication in two steps first, I call Membership.ValidateUserusername, password to do all the basic checks. If that succeeds, then I call a custom stored procedure to do the additional authentication. If this additional authentication fails, I would like to update the aspnetMembership database table to record the failure  so that the user can get locked out after 3 failed authentication attempts in the same way that failed logins are handled in Membership.ValidateUser.p  pI did some research and determined that the Membership.ValidateUser method records failed logins and locks out the user account by calling the aspnetMembershipUpdateUserInfo stored procedure. So I decided to just call this stored procedure from within my custom authentication stored procedure as needed, in order to increment the FailedPasswordAttemptCount column, IsLockedOut, etc.p  pThe problem is that when I invoke this stored procedure directly, the stored procedure is unable to retrieve the correct datetime value FailedPasswordAttemptWindowStart from the aspnetMembership table in order to correctly increment the FailedPasswordAttemptCount. The UpdateUserInfo stored procedure declares a local variable and does a select statement to retrieve this datetime value from the membership table into the local varable. The datetime value it retrieves is always 17540101 000000.000, regardless of what value is stored in the table.p  pI am trying to figure out why I cannot retrieve the correct datetime value from this database table within this stored procedure. Here is what I have triedp  pIncorrect datetime value is retrieved whenp  ul liinvoke aspnetMembershipUpdateUserInfo from my custom stored procedure, which in turn is invoked from C using Linq to SQLli liinvoke aspnetMembershipUpdateUserInfo directly from my application using Linq to SQLli liinvoke a custom stored procedure that has the same code as UpdateUserInfo from my stored procedure, or directly from Cli ul  pCorrect datetime value is retrieved whenp  ul liInvoking aspnetMembershipUpdateUserInfo directly from SQL Server Management Studioli liInvoking my custom stored procedure directly from SSMS, which in turn invokes aspnetMembershipUpdateUserInfo li liaspnetMembershipUpdateUserInfo is invoked via the Membership.ValidateUser methodli ul  pHas anyone seen a problem like this, where a stored procedure selects a value of 17540101 from a db table instead of the correct value Id really like to have an understanding of why this is happening, but would be open to a workaround to somehow avoid this issue entirely. All I really need is a way to track failed usernamepassword and failed custom authentication attempts in the same way, so that the user gets locked out after too many failures.p  pThanksp

Negative 2859 pWhat I want to do is I have many classes first of all, they all have the same music throughout, as i said in the app delegates bool application did finish launching method. But in my last 3 classes, I want different music, fair enough, I put these lines of code p  precode [Smart2AppDelegate [UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate pauseAudioPlayer] [Smart2AppDelegate [UIApplication sharedApplication].delegate newAudioPlayer] codepre  pAnd in my app delegatep  precode voidnewAudioPlayer   NSString music  [[NSBundle mainBundle]                    pathForResourcewin ofTypem4a] audio.delegate  self self.audio  [[AVAudioPlayer alloc] initWithContentsOfURL[NSURL fileURLWithPathmusic] errorNULL]  [audio play] audio.numberOfLoops  1         voidpauseAudioPlayer   [audio pause]   codepre  pSo it works, whenever I go to that view, it changes music, lets call that view, view x. Now, from that view x I can go to and from only to 2 other views, e.g. I can go to the info page and there is a back button that leads back to that view x, and the same with a prize page. But when I go back to the view x, the music starts from the beginning, when in these three classes, i want them to all loop and  not go from beginning because it sounds akward. The reason is simple it is because I put it in the viewDidLoad. But how can I do this, I was thinking of a way to actually group classes and put in the avaudioplayer method in there.p

Negative 2859 pI am working on a C program to determine the line length for each row in multiple large text files with 100,000 rows before importing using an SSIS package. I will also be checking other values on each line to verify they are correct befor importing them into my database using SSIS. p  pFor example, I am expecting a line length of 3000 characters and then a CR at 3001 and LF at 3002, so overall a total of 3002 characters.p  pWhen using ReadLine it reads a CR or LF as and end of line so that I cant check the CR or LF characters. I had been just checking the length of the line at 3000 to determine if the length was correct. I have just encountered an issue where the file has a LF at position 3001 but was missing the CR. So ReadLine says it is 3000 char witch is correct but it will fail in my SSIS package because it is missing a CR.p  pI have verified that Read will reach each char 1 at a time and I can determine if each line has a CR and LF but this seems rather unproductive, and when some files I will encounter with have upwards of 5,000,000 rows this seems very inefficient. I will also need to then add each char into a string or use ReadBlock and convert a char array into a string so that I can check other values in the line.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas on an efficient way to check the line for CR and LF and other values on a given line without wasting unnecessary resources and to finish in a relatively timely manner.   p

Currently im working with some AspectJ code ive found herep  pa hrefhttpweblogs.java.netblogalexfromsunarchive200602debuggingswing.html relnofollowhttpweblogs.java.netblogalexfromsunarchive200602debuggingswing.htmlap  pto see whether this will highlight any odd places where its not doing the right thing.p  pOther than that though, any other thoughtsp  pRe transparency assumptions  how would this be manifested What am I looking for While ive done a fair bit of work improving the code, its largely inherited from previous people so Im not as intimately familiar with it as might be helpful p  pRe pasting code fragments  Id love to, but without narrowing the problem down I cant think of a sensible constrained fragment to post, I literally have no idea where the problem might lie in the code unfortunately.p  pThanks for all the responses thus far.p  pstrongORIGINAL QUESTIONstrongp  pWe have an application that is hosted inside a third party system.  Our part is a JPanel that is returned, the host application Lagan CRM then embeds that Panel in to their application.p  pIn most cases this is working very well, however occasionally, and in only one implementation that we know of, the panel does not update correctly  its like something has stopped a part of the panel from being updated.p  pIn the screenshots below, our JPanel is right at the bottom, the top left of it is essentially the INFO button.p  pHere are a few screenshots demonstrating the issuep  pIn this example, the issue is visible around the Go unavailable and Dial button area. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTAPTv.png altExample 1p  pIn this example, the issue is in the same emgeneralem area but it is not the same dimensions, indeed weve not found any commonality in respect of the area  size of the anomoly. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2bkPq.png altExample 2p  pIn this example ive done a bit more communication with the user and it seems like what happened was the user prior to the current call the user had the GO UNAVAILABLE button shown.  They then started a conversation with a caller, which means that the system should then start showing CONNECT on the top left, the phone number below and it has the HANGUP button on the right.  As you can see, its updated only around the outside of it, theres a large block in the middle area that has not been updated at all and is still acting as though theyre not on a call.  Besides looking ugly, it causes problems because there are two or three buttons that should replace the GO UNAVAILABLE one and this means that functionality is not accessible. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.commALWy.png altExample 3p  pI just wanted to show a few examples so that you can see they are different blocks each time, but the basic issue is always the same.p  pSome basic statsp  ol lipOnly happens on XP machines.pli lipOnly happens at one customer site out of about 1015 sites that use it, but happens on all the machines at that site.pli lipIve asked about windows popping up over the top but the only one they are aware of they have sent me a screenshot for and it doesnt overlap much, certainly nothing remotely similar to these patterns.pli lipJava 1.5 is being used on this site, getting 100 workstations updated to 1.6 is not impossible but I would need to have some reasonable indication its going to help.  pli lipWe have many other sites on 1.5 without this issue.pli lipWeve asked about what other software might be running on the machines and to be honest theres very little as they are contact centre agent workstations and tightly bolted down.pli lipThe panel will right itself once the caller hangs up, but it means the agent effectively loses that call as they cant do anything with it.  This implies to me its essentially being blocked from an update rather than being persistently blocked.pli lipPanel is implemented in SWING, nothing particularly fancy in there.pli ol  pAny hints, tips, guidance, suggestions for other questions I can get answers to  or even better, solutions  would be very gratefully received.p

Negative 2859 pI have monodevelop 2.8 on top of monotouch 5 agains the Xcode 4.2 SDK.  I have been having memory issues with my iPhone app.  I have been struggling with identifying the cause, so I created a test app with a master detail view.  I made a minor modification to the rootcontroller to have it show 5 root items instead of the default 1.  Each click of the root item adds a new DetailViewController into the navigation controller.p  precodecontroller.NavigationController.PushViewController DetailViewController, true codepre  pIn my detail view controller Ive added logic that simply take an input that governs the number of times a loop happens, and then a button to trigger the loop to occur and make a call to a REST based service.  Very minimal code changes from the default.p  pJust running the example and looking at it in instruments I seem to be up to 1.2 MB of live bytes.  I think launch the detail view by touching items in the root view controller and I get up over 2 MB.  Rotating the display or triggering the keyboard to open gets memory up near 3 MB.  I navigate back in the controller and open a different view from the rootviewcontroller and I can see the memory grow some more.  Just moving in and out of views without even triggering my custom code I can get the memory use in instruments over 3 MB.  Ive seen my app receive memory warnings when being up over 3 MB before.  My test detail view is very basic with a text box, a label, and a button that all have outlets on them.  I was under the impression I dont need to do anything special to have them cleanup.  However, I dont see live bytes drop in instruments.  p  pAs an additional test, I added a Done button.  When the done button is pressed I go and use RemoveFromSuperview on each outlet, Dispose, and then set it to null.  I see the live bytes drop.  But that doesnt do anything for me if the back navigation is used instead.p  pIm curious if anyone can verify my expectations of seeing memory drop.  Not sure if using instruments to look at live bytes is even valid or not.  Id like to determine if my testing is even valid and if there are tips for reducing memory foot print.  Any links to best practices on reducing the memory foot print are appreciated as I seem to be able to get the memory to climb and my app to start getting memory warnings just by navigating around between screens.p

The query is something like as followsp  precodeSelect TOP 20  from select rownumber OVER Order By F desc as rownum,               user., ..        from user        inner join X on user.blah  X.blah        left outer join Y on user.foo  Y.foo        where DATEDIFFdd, LastLogin, GetDate gt 200 and Y.bar gt FUBAR as temp  where rownum gt 0   codepre  pAccording to the execution plan 91 of the cost is in the Sort.

Now most of the time the users just look at results in the 1  5 pages 1 page has 20 records hence the Top20 so I was thinking if there was any way I could limit the rows being processed and sorted and make the query faster and less CPU intensive most of the time. p  pEDIT When I say to Calculate F tables are joined, what I mean is this. F takes in parameters such as X.blah and Y.foo and Y.bar. Thats it.

Negative 2859 pHey guys Im having a problem with Google Chrome 16 on one of the sites Im supporting that i cant fix couple a days now.  p  pThe site is using forms authentication. There is a hyperlink that when clicked is calling a web handler, that is supposed to go fetch a PDF file. Everything is working great in all browsers except in Google Chrome. p  pWhen I click that link in Chrome it gives me code401  Unauthorized Access is denied due to invalid credentials.code. Ive checked the request headers and the only difference I can see is that the authentication cookie is not present in the request made by Chrome 16. The strange thing is that everything is working great on the local machine, but once uploaded to the production server chrome is not sending that cookie.  p  pIve implemented IReadOnlySessionState interface in the web handler, as suggested here and there in forums, but this didnt solve the issue.p  pDoes any of you have an idea why chrome is acting like thatp

Negative 2859 pIm interested in the best way to do user auth in a mobile app. At the moment the set up is quite simple. Im storing the username and password on the app and sending it to the api each time I need to run a restricted query.p  pThis I feel is probably the wrong way to go about this.p  pWould a better way to be to send the username and password when the user logs in and then store that users id The problem with this is that then the api accepts a user id and not a username and password. A user id will be much easier to guess at and malicious persons would be able to submit a req to the api with randomly selected user ids performing actions under their account. I have an api key. Is this secure enoughp  pThe issue is that I want to start integrating twitter and facebook oauth into the app. I havent read much about it, but I think you get a token. How would this work with the set up that youre suggesting Would there be benefit to creating a token in my own database of users and using the token whether it be mine, facebooks or twitters as the authorisation Or would it make sense to keep each service separate and deal with them separatelyp  pThank you.p

Negative 2859 pI have recently set up a Node.js based web socket server that has been tested to handle around 2,000 new connection requests per second on a small EC2 instance m1.small.  Considering the cost of a m1.small instance, and the ability to put multiple instances behind a WebSocket capable proxy server such as HAProxy, we are very happy with the results.p  pHowever, we realised we had not done any testing using SSL yet, so looked into a number of SSL options.  It became apparent that terminating SSL connections at the proxy server is ideal because then the proxy server can inspect the traffic and insert headers such as XForwardFor so that the server knows which IP the request came from.p  pSo I looked into a number of solutions such as Pound, stunnel and stud, all of which allowed incoming connections on 443 to be terminated, and then passed onto HAProxy on port 80, which in turn passes the connection onto the web servers.  Unfortunately however, I found that sending traffic to the SSL termination proxy server on a c1.medium High CPU instance very quickly consumed all CPU resources, and only at a rate of 50 or so requests per second.  I tried using all three of the solution listed above, and all of them performed roughly the same as I assume under the hood they all rely on OpenSSL anyway.  I tried using a 64 bit very large High CPU instance c1.xlarge and found that performance only scale linearly with cost.  So based on EC2 pricing, Id need to pay roughly 600pm for 200 SSL requests per second, as opposed to 60pm for 2,000 non SSL requests per second.  The former price becomes economically unviable very quickly when we start planning to accept 1,000s or 10,000s of requests per second. p  pI also tried terminating the SSL using Node.js https server, and the performance was very similar to Pound, stunnel and stud, so no clear advantage to that approach.p  pSo what I am hoping someone can help with is advising how I can get around this ridiculous cost we have to absorb to provide SSL connections.  I have heard that SSL hardware accelerators provide much better performance as the hardware is designed for SSL encryption and decryption, but as we are currently using Amazon EC2 for all of our servers, using SSL hardware accelerators is not an option unless we have a separate data centre with physical servers.  I am just struggling to see how the likes of Amazon, Google, Facebook can provide all their traffic over SSL when the cost of this is so high.  There must be a better solution out there.p  pAny advice or ideas would be greatly appreciated.p  pThanks Mattp

Negative 2859 pHow to generate random numbers with a stable distribution in C The Random class has uniform distribution.  Many other code on the internet show normal distribution. But we need stable distribution meaning infinite variance, a.k.a fattailed distribution.p  pThe reason is for generating realistic stock prices.  In the real  world, huge variations in prices are far more likely than in normal distributions.p  pDoes someone know the C code to convert Random class output into stable distributionp  pEdit Hmmm. Exact distribution is less critical than ensuring it will randomly generate huge sigma like at least 20 sigma. We want to test a trading strategy for resilience in a true fat tailed distribution which is exactly how stock market prices behave.p  pI just read about ZipFian and Cauchy due to comments. Since I must pick, lets go with Cauchy distribution but I will also try ZipFian to compare.p

Negative 2859 pI am facing a problem for which I dont have a clean solution. I am writing a Java application and the application stores certain data in a limited set of files. We are not using any database, just plain files. Due to some usertriggered action, certain files needs to be changed. I need this to be a allornothing operation. That is, either all files are updated, or none of them. It is disastrous if for example 2 of the 5 files are changed, while the other 3 are not due to some IOException.p  pWhat is the best strategy to accomplish this Is embedding an inmemory database, such as hsqldb, a good reason to get this kind of atomicitytransactional behaviorp  pThanks a lotp

Negative 2859 pAll considerations about when to use which aside, I am still unsure about pointer vs reference semantics.p  pRight now, I am under the impression that references are essentially pointers that must be initialized when they are declared, and then from that point on cannot point to anything else. In other words, they are a like a codeType constcode not codeType constcode, or, they cannot be emreseatedem. It essentially becomes a new name for that object. Now I heard that references do not actually need to be implemented by the compiler using pointers, but I am under the impression that you can still think of them this way, in regards to what their visible behavior will be.p  pBut why cant you do something like thisp  precodeintamp foo  new int codepre  pI want to create a reference to dynamic memory. This does not compile. I get the errorp  precodeerror invalid initialization of nonconst reference of type intamp from a temporary of type int codepre  pThat makes sense to me. It seems the new operator returns a pointer of given type to the address of memory that the OS dynamically allocated for me.p  pSo how do I create a reference to dynamic memoryp  pEdit Links to resources that precisely explain the difference between references and pointers in C would be appreciated.p

Negative 2859 pI have a Symfony 1.4 and Doctrine 1.2 project running and have a problem with output escaping in one of my DB calls.p  pThe thing is, I am not retrieving a PHP object in my Doctrine query, but rather an array in PHP. The reason why I am doing this is another topic altogether, lets just say getting a PHP object would not be the solution. Essentially the query is an inner join between two doctrine models. Model 1 inner joins with Model 2 and the results yielded can be accessed like thisp  precodeforeachresults as result   echo result[field1]  accessing results for model 1   echo result[model2][field1]  accessing results for model 2 this inner joins with the model  codepre  pNow for the above, more specifically for model2, field1 consists of HTML markup, which is naturally output escaped. I need the HTML markup to be rendered as it is Which is where the problem lies, p  pif this was a regulation Doctrine object, a simple modelObjectgetRawValuegetField would render HTML markup without escaping it. I am not sure how HTML markup can be rendered in a PHP array p  pThanksp

Negative 2859 pIve added support for mods for my game. Any Python module put in a specific folder is automatically imported on startup. All is fine, except now Ive written an official mod which allows mod makers to easily add GUI settings of their mods to a single toggable GUI frame. They are not forced to use it, but it greatly simplifies adding GUI settings with helper functions and makes things more organized and simpler for the players.p  pThe problem is since its a mod itself, its imported on startup with the rest of the mods Python modules, so if there is another mod which has a name which comes before it, it cannot use my mod. I know I could add 0 or something to my modules name, but that wouldnt be very clean and you cant be very sure someone wont name his own mods modules like that.p  pSo Im wondering if theres any way to tell Python to import a module first, by specifying it inside the module itself Im pretty sure there isnt, but who knowsp  pOne solution I thought of is to make a subfolder which would be searched for modules first.p  pAnother one might be merging the mods code with the games. Dont want to do that as to not give the impression that its the only way to add mod settings.p

Negative 2859 pI have an application that runs on Ubuntu Linux 12.04 which needs to store and retrieve a large number of large serialized objects. Currently the store is implemented by simply saving the serialized streams as files, where the filenames equal the md5 hash of the serialized object. However I would like to speed things up replacing the filestore by one that does inmemory caching of objects that are recently readwritten, and preferably does the hashing for me.p  pThe design of my application should not get any more complicated. Hence preferably would be a storing backend that manages a keyvalue database and caching in an abstracted and efficient way. I am a bit lost with all of the keyvalue stores that are out there, and much of the topicsinformation seems to be outdated. I was initially looking at something like memcachedmembase, but maybe there are better solutions out there. I looked into redis, mongodb, couchdb, but it is not quite clear to me if they fit my needs. p  pMy most important requirementsp  ul liTransparent saving to a persistent store in a way that the most recently writtenread objects are quickly available by automatically caching them in memory.li liStore should survive a reboot. Hence in memory objects should be saved on disk asap. li liCurrently I am calculating the md5 manually. It would actually be nicer if the backend does this for me.

Negative 2859 pI have a successfully working interface that I programmed using PHP GD Library where a user can enter multiple lines of text and when the user clicks submit it overlays the text they typed onto a png background.p  pIs it possible to do the same thing but use AJAX in the process  Id like to somehow let each input field filled out automatically do an onblur, and trigger an AJAX script.  That way they see the data entered into the fields change the image on the fly.p  pNormally when using AJAX, it sends a success callback to an input field, alert, or sets it into a DIV.  Would I place the entire GD Library code into the PHP POST page and process it there, then somehow send the compiled PNG image to the AJAX success callbackp  pIm just needing a general idea as to if its possible, and the basic outline as to how Id go about solving this.

Will I save it to my server, then display the img src that was saved as the AJAX success callback  Im confused because I thought AJAX loaded things instantly without refreshing the page but will that still happen if saving the file to the server, then showing it in an image placeholderp

My problem is that one task may trigger a commit, terminates, pass the control to the other task which in turn issue another commit. When the first commit isnt done before the second task starts, I get solr lock timeout exception.p  pOne solution I was investigating is to have each of these tasks simply do an update and no commit. The problem, however is that changes by early tasks are not visible to later tasks. Thus the later tasks end up overwriting some of the changes done by the previous ones.p  pNow, I am investigating  whether I can detect the end of each commit before triggering the next task. Any ideap  pHow would you guys resolve this problemp  pThese tasks are offtheshelf nontrivial components that i cannot really change.p  pThanks, Maxp

Negative 2859 pIm stumped. We have a client who cannot log in to our system and yet we can log in fine using her credentials. She can also log in fine from her friends home. p  pUpon entering her credentials the screen simply refreshes and nothing happens when in fact she should be brought to a dashboard page. When I monitor the request via the Chrome web developer tools I can see that the dashboard does get requested after log in but then suddenly were brought back to the log in page. p  pNow Ive cleared her cache, cookies and all other temporary internet files from both IE9 her default browser and Chrome. Nothing happens. Ive read that changing session names might help but that did nothing either. p  pThe system is using the newest version of CakePHP 2.2.1 and absolutely any help would be appreciated. p
Negative 2859 phere is the scenario that I should createp  pthere is OL list of numbers, 1,2,3,4,5,6. User can selectclick those numbers. When one clicks it, the number should go to another OL list animated, the number flys overe the screen. The numbers should be always in ordered order in the new list. So if user clicks first 5 it copies and flies to new list, and if user then clicks number 1, it should fly and go before 5. And so... so the new list numbers should something like 1,3,5 no matter in which order user clicked the numbers.p  pOk, so that is what I want to achieve.

Negative 2859 pMy organization is having an interesting internal debate right now that raises a question that I would like to open to the community at large.p  pThe issue at hand is our environment in which we do stresstesting, capacitytesting, performanceregressiontesting, and the like.p  pOn one side of the debate are some software engineers who would like this environment to mirror the production environment as much as possible, in the interest of making the results as meaningful as possible.  While we currently do have an environment for such testing, it is far less capable than the production system, and these software engineers feel that they are reaching the limits of what they can learn from it.p  pOn the other side of the debate are some network engineers who both administer the environments and control the pursestrings.  While they concede that capacitytesting would be better in an environment that is a better replica of the production environment, they argue that  for the purposes of stress testing  a more modest environment would have the effect of magnifying performance bottlenecks, making them easier to discover and fix.p  pstrongThis finally brings us to the part that piqued my interest  one software engineer suggests that while a more modest stress environment will increase the likelihood that you will encounter emsomeem bottleneck, it does not necessarily follow that it would help you find the next bottleneck you may encounter in production.  The scaling effect, he argues, may not be linear.strongp  pIs there merit to that point of view  If yes, then why  What are the sources of that nonlinearity p  pThere are a lot of moving parts involved here a cluster of java application servers, a cluster of database servers, lots of dynamic content being generated for each HTTP hit.p  hr  pemEdit  I appreciate everybodys thoughts so far, but I was really hoping that someone would do more than reaffirm one side or the other and actually tackle the question of why.  If there is such nonlinearity, what gives rise to it  Better yet it would be great if the reasons were expressed in terms of the CPU, memory, bandwidth, latency, interactions between subsystems, what have you...

Negative 2859 pIf you set your target SDK version in the Android manifest file to 3, then your layout on largescreen devices will be just a scaled up version of what it is on smallscreen devices. Once you set the target SDK to a higher SDK, you can create separate layouts for each screen density, which provides a much better user experience.p  pstrongHoweverstrong, my layout is mainly made up of images, that are high enough resolution that they display just fine on all screen sizes, even when scaled up, because theyre big enough that they dont need to be stretched. Now, it would be much easier for me to just create a smallscreen layout and have it scaled up, because it would still look nice on large screens. Is there any way I can get that effect without going back to API level 3p

Negative 2859 pI recently decided to upgrade to python 3, and start converting some of my scripts. I encountered a problem in a script that uses a module named codeiocode  in python 2, this is perfectly fine, however in python 3, codeiocode is a standard module for files. I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1224741pythonimportwithnameconflictsthis old questiona about the same kind of problem, however this appears to be in reference to python 2. I have the opposite problem  given two files, codemain.pycode and codeio.pycode in the top level package, codeimport iocode in codemain.pycode will import the standard codeiocode module, not the local one. codefrom future import absoluteimportscode didnt help, and codefrom . import iocode and related attempts fail as expected which I have never understood  python really doesnt know where the top level package is. Renaming is obviously a solution, but if possible Id like to avoid it. Is there some python 3 standard way of resolving module name conflictsp

The initial route loads the LandingView which has a login template. After logging in, it calls the goTo method of router.js to spawn a DashboardView. Although this works, I feel that its a bit ugly. But I cant figure how else to spawn a new DashboardView from LandingView without either directly referencing DashboardView from inside of LandingView or from the router. p  pIf I continue doing this via router.js I will end up pulling, directly or indirectly, all my views js files from the router. Sounds a bit uglyp  pI looked at Derick Baileys event aggregator pattern but faced the question of how does the DashboardView subscribe to an event generate by the LandingView if an instance of DashboardView doesnt even exist yet Someone has to create and initialize it for it to subscribe to an event aggregator, right And if that someone is the router, do I need to instantiate all the views upfront in the router That doesnt make sense.p

Negative 2859 pSometimes, knowing what happens 1 layer underneath is a good thing but IMO .NET is becoming so abstract in a good way it can make learning difficult as I dont understand what goes on below the surfacep  pI assume .NET is very coupled with the MS operating system. So, when using Directory or File classes, I can get data on the file and can understand just the theory on how it works.p  pBut, something like Java is not native to Windows. So, how can it reference a file on my hard drive Although I would have liked my question to be about any non Microsoft language, Im limiting to Java to keep it focusedp  pIn my head, there are only 2 ways.p  ol lipGet the file direct from the hard drive and therefore not use the OS.br OR and this is where I am getting lost  pli lipWould the Java Runtime environment have to create an Instance of the OS to then get the public method which exposes a HereAreTheFiles method.

Negative 2859 pMy technology stack is Tomcat servlet 3.0, Jersey for JAXRS, Spring and Hibernate. When something unexpect goes wrong like some data conversion error in Hibernate, I do not want the clients to see my stacktrace for those exceptions that the Tomcat tries to print by default. However I would like to log those exceptions so I can find what is wrong and fix things.p  pMy first try was using ExceptionMapper from JAXRS and naively thinking that would solve my problems. But then I noticed that Jersey throws its own exceptions for example urls that are not mapped are com.sun.jersey.api.NotFoundExceptions. This causes 404 exceptions to be logged which I dont want. Worse, the client no longer gets 404 but a status code 500.p  pI could just create exception mappers for the exceptions that jersey throws but I could miss something. Is there a best practice for something like thisp

Negative 2859 pIm doing a slideshow and each slide has a url format like this codearticles1234slide5code. I want to retrive the codeslide5code part from the url in my url.py file and then pass it to the corresponding view function and finally, pass it to the template and render the right slide. The url settings is as followsp  precodeurlrPltarticleidgtdslidePltcurrentslidegtd1,2, articles.views.showarticle codepre  pBut it seems that it cannot get the codecurrentslidecode variable from the url. I guess it has something to do with the anchor part cause its not transferred to the server. But if I ignore the anchor part in my url settings and use javascript to handle this hashtag, it seems that everytime I enter the url in browser, it first renders the page without the anchor part and then jumps to the right slide I want. It cannot render the right slide directly. How could I fix thisp

Negative 2859 pIm new to iOS development and a bit lost. My question is both about general user experience and concrete architecture advices.p  pBasically my app should work as followsp  pAt first start it requests information from remote server, requests user location with GPS. While these things happening, app should display some kind of firstlaunch view with progress indicator and text. First question is what if user cant download information from remote server This information is essential and app cant continue to work without it. Should I just retry to download Should I present some MessageBox to user With desktop application I would present user two choices  Retry or Exit. Exit is not acceptable in iOS applications, so should I present message box Or I just need to inform user about problems via text on this firstlaunch view and silently retry to download information until it succeeds Or create button Retry and let user do thatp  pIf device provided user location and download was successful, I have all information needed to continue. Otherwise user must choose his country and city before continue.p  pThen I have 3 tabs with different functionality. I already implemented that.p  pSo my question is how to display firstload view and its controller Should I check in appdelegate initialization method and assign firstload view as main view and then reassign to usual application UITabbarController not sure how to do it Or I need to set UITabbarController as root controller and in first tab controller on initializing I should check if it is firsttime start and call something like presentViewController for firsttime view controller I would like to implement this check somewhere else, appdelegate is good place for that, because initialization code doesnt really belong to first tab controller.p  pI created sample programs with multiple views which were managed by UITabbarController or UINavigationController, but I dont understand how to manage multiple views myself, without helper controllers which did that work for me.p

Negative 2859 pI currently am experiencing very slow performance by iterating through quad triangle strips and drawing each one separately, so I would like to batch all of my rectangles into one single draw call.p  pLooking around, it seems the best way to do this is to simply occur the overhead of duplicating vertices and using GLTRIANGLES instead of GLTRIANGLESTRIP, simply drawing two separate triangles for each rectangle.p  pThe problem is that each rectangle can have a different color, and I need to programmatically change the color of any of the rectangles.  So simply using one GLTRIANGLES call does not do the trick.  Instead, it looks like Ill need to somehow index color data with my vertex data, associating a color with each rectangle.

Negative 2859 pIm curious what exactly decorators are in AngularJS. There isnt much information online for decorators save for a blurb in the a hrefhttpdocs.angularjs.orgapiAUTO.providedecoratorAngularJS documentationa and a brief albeit interesting mention in a a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvVxuN6WO3tIAyoutube videoa.p  pAs the Angular guys put it a decorator isp  blockquote   pDecoration of service, allows the decorator to intercept the service   instance creation. The returned instance may be the original instance,   or a new instance which delegates to the original instance.p blockquote  pI dont really know what that emmeansem, and Im not sure why you would separate this logic from the service itself. For example if I wanted to return something different under different conditions I would just pass different arguments to the relevant functions or use another function sharing that private state.p  pIm still kind of an AngularJS noob so Im sure its just ignorance andor bad habits Ive picked up.p
Negative 2859 pI am new here. I am a beginner in Qt but i am an intermediate level programmer in c. I had written a program previously in C and STLNo code is platform dependent and whole program is broken into around ten .cpp.h files. Now if I develop A Gui in qt,can I link it to my old program or should I rewrite everything For instance I use file IO using fstream. But in Qt I see there is QFile so is it possible to link it. The program is pretty lengthy. So it will be very hard to rewrite everything. Gui is not mandatory for me but I thought it would be good for presentation.It is for my Project so please reply soon.Please give me some examples or sites to refer to if possible.

Negative 2859 pI need to calculate how much of a block of text codeAcode is in another block of text codeBcode. Simple algorithms like soundex arent providing great results for me as text codeBcode has additional text within it that isntshouldnt be in text codeAcode, which throws my figures off. I need to ensure a certain percentage of codeAcode is within codeBcode, and ignore the additions to codeBcode.p  pMy first thought for a simple algorithm that might work well in my case would be to split codeAcode into sentences, note the total number of sentences, then search codeBcode for an instance of each sentence to provide a percentage. While this should work it feels quite hacky, and Im sure someone more intelligent than I has devised an algorithm to provide a better calculation on a similar principle.p

Negative 2859 pI want to know the applicability of the Akka Actor model.p  pI know it is useful in the case a huge number of Actor instances are created and destroyed. e.g. a call server, where every incoming call creates an actor instance and communicates with few other actors and get killed after the call is over.p  pemIs it also useful in the following scenario emp  pA server has a few processing elements 1050 implemented over Actors. The lifetime of these processing elements is infinite. some of them do not maintain state and a few maintain state. The processing elements process the message and pass the message to other actors in a fixed manner. The system receives a huge number of messages from outside and gets passed through processing elements and goes out of the system.p  pMy gut feeling is that we cannot get any advantage by using Akka Actor model and even implementing this server in Scala. Because the use case for which Akka is designed, is not applicable here. If the scaleup meant that processing elements be increased dynamically then it would be applicable. p  pFor fixed topologies, I think if i implement it in Java, it is going to be more beneficial in terms of raw performance. The immutability feature of Scala leads to more copies and so reduces performance. So i believe i better stick to Java.p  pIs my understanding correct I a nut shell i want to know why i should leave Java and use ScalaAkka for the application scenario above. and my target is to process 1 million messages per second.p

Negative 2859 pI am loading a mc called Spiri into a mc called Box. Later I want to remove both from memory usage and off screen. I have the off screen in a tween not shown here. p  pstrongIf I use coderemoveChildboxcode will it also remove all Children with instrong  Basically I am loading 3 movies from library with a function call. Then trying to remove them and call the same function multiple times. Which means the same movies are loaded again and again with the same names.  This IS SUPPOSED TO replace the old ones but maybe its not because I am not removing them properly because by the 10th or 15th call it is getting very slow. p  pI am also adding an eventlistener in a function too. Is that then adding a some eventListner every single time and taking up resources as well p  pIt seems to be very slow after several times running a that function which makes me believe something is not getting unloaded correctly.p  precodeI tried  box.removeChildSpiri Spiri  null then remove the parent like this removeChildbox   but this gets an error. again if i just do this removeChildSpiri  it makes me wondering if they are getting removed. codepre  pHow what is the best way to remove parent and all children in an mc p

Negative 2859 pIm trying to update some old code to replace a bunch of nested tables in an old page. The page dynamically generates a list of Environments and for each environment the table contains a nested table that lists out each Item in that environment. Im having some big time trouble rewriting this with CSS Im primarily a back end dev. The existing table needs each nested table to be collapsible so you start with only seeing the header for each nested table, and expand to see the body by clicking a little plus img. I know this needs to be done with multiple lists, which I can do with 1 table, but the nested tables are killing me. I would prefer to use jquery for the collapsing and sorting.p  pHere is some example html of what the table looks like. Keep in mind this is all dynamically generated and the nested tables need to be collapsible. The entire table should be sortable.p  precodelttable idenv classsortableonloadgt   lttheadgt      lttrgt       ltth classsortablegtEnvironmentltthgt       ltth classsortablegtDescriptionltthgt       ltth classsortablegtStatusltthgt       ltth classsortablegtItemsltthgt     lttrgt   lttheadgt   lttbodygt     lttrgt         lttdgtltbgtDynamic link to environment detailsltbgtlttdgt         lttdgtDynamic Descriptionlttdgt         lttdgtDynamic Statuslttdgt         lttdgt             lttablegt                  lttheadgt                 ltthgt                     lttdgtIndividual Itemslttdgt                     lttdgtDescriptionlttdgt                 ltthgt                 lttheadgt everything under this header should be collapsible                  lttrgt                     lttd iditemidgtdynamic item namelttdgt                     lttdgtlttdgt                 lttrgt                 lttrgt                     lttd iditemidgtdynamic item namelttdgt                     lttdgtlttdgt                 lttrgt                 lttrgt                     lttd iditemidgtdynamic item namelttdgt                     lttdgtlttdgt                 lttrgt             lttablegt     lttrgt     lttrgt         lttdgtltbgtDynamic link to environment detailsltbgtlttdgt         lttdgtDynamic Descriptionlttdgt         lttdgtDynamic Statuslttdgt         lttdgt             lttablegt                 lttheadgt                 ltthgt                     lttdgtIndividual Itemslttdgt                     lttdgtDescriptionlttdgt                 ltthgt                 lttheadgt everything under this header should be collapsible                  lttrgt                     lttd iditemidgtdynamic item namelttdgt                     lttdgtlttdgt                 lttrgt                 lttrgt                     lttd iditemidgtdynamic item namelttdgt                     lttdgtlttdgt                 lttrgt                 lttrgt                     lttd iditemidgtdynamic item namelttdgt                     lttdgtlttdgt                 lttrgt             lttablegt     lttrgt     lttbodygt lttablegt codepre

Negative 2859 pMy idea is to build a simple chat application for iOS and Android. In any case, my question is related to the serverside.

Negative 2859 pI have this question   You are given a singly linked list L where each node in L stores an integer key, and a pointer to the next node in L. The last node has its next node set to NULL. You are given a pointer ptr to a node storing key k, which is not the last node in the list. Show how to delete the key k from the list given ptr the pointer to the node that contains k your algorithm should have time complexity O1, i.e., it should be independent of the length of the list. Assume you have pointers to the head and tail nodes of L.p  pI know that if we have a doubly linked list we can delete the node in O1 time complexity,  but how can we do it in singly linked list  dont we have to iterate over all the list in order to find the node just before it p

Negative 2859 pIm seeing what seems to be a very obvious bug with scalacheck, such that if its really there I cant see how people use it for recursive data structures.p  pThis program fails with a codeStackOverflowErrorcode before scalacheck takes over, while constructing the codeArbitrarycode value. Note that the codeTreecode type and the generator for codeTreecodes is taken verbatim from a hrefhttplamp.epfl.chfilescontentsiteslampfilesteachingprogfunScalacheckTutorial.htmlthis scalacheck tutoriala.p  precodepackage treegen  import org.scalacheck. import Prop.  class TreeProperties extends PropertiesTree     trait Tree   case class Nodeleft Tree, right Tree extends Tree   case class Leafx Int extends Tree    val ints  Gen.choose100, 100    def leafs Gen[Leaf]  for      x lt ints    yield Leafx    def nodes Gen[Node]  for      left lt trees     right lt trees    yield Nodeleft, right    def trees Gen[Tree]  Gen.oneOfleafs, nodes    implicit lazy val arbTree Arbitrary[Tree]  Arbitrarytrees    propertyvacuous  forAll  t Tree gt true    object Main extends App    new TreeProperties.check  codepre  pWhats stranger is that changes that shouldnt affect anything seem to alter the program so that it works.

Negative 2859 pIm currently working on a a task which involves the printing of a JTable on a pre defined template such as the one showed in the attached image.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhLxN4.png altenter image description herep  pMy approach is the printing of the JFrame that contains the table, as I have set the attached image as the background of the JFrame.p  pI then created a PrintUIWindow which implements the Printable object. This PrintUIWindow takes in the object of the JFrame to be printed as an argument of its constructor.p  pThe above approach doesnt work for me asp  pFirstly since Im printing the JFrame, only the visible section of my    JTable is printed. This is my main problem as I would like to print    my entire JTable on a template on different pages assuming the number    of rows in the JTable exceed those that can be printed on a single    page.p  pSecondly the JFrame doesnt fit on an A4 sheet. Essentially Ive had    to resize the image to height of 550x778 which is the same height and    width of the JFrame Im passing along for printing. This is the only    way Ive been able to fit the JFrame and content on an A4 sheet.p  pThird, having reduced the size of the image to match the JFrame    which when printed fits on an A4 sheet, the quality of the printout    is pixelated due to the low quality of the abovementioned template    image which Im using as the background image of the JFrame to be    printed.p  pBelow is my code for

Negative 2859 pI cannot find any info on this anywhere. I have a long running process triggered by a HTTP request, and then another short process triggered by a HTTP request that checks the status of the long running process. Both are called via AJAX. The first by a button click, and the second on a continuous timeout.p  pIf I run the requests one at a time, then they work. The problem is, when running the first process, Eclipse completely ignores the second request if the first hasnt finished, but I need the second request to be debugged whilst the first request is still being processedp  pIve even tried running the first process independently of the debugger, and just trying to use the debugger for the second process. However I just cant seem to catch the second process in the debugger like I can the first.p  pIdeally Id like to be able to debug 2 or more processes simultaneously.p  pIt appears this can be done using Eclipse and Java. However PHP support is looking pretty thin.p

One fragment contains 3 buttons at the top.  When the fragment initially loads, the buttons display correctly.

It must  start withp  p   4 for Visa cardsp  p   5 for Master cardsp  p   37 for American Express cardsp  pIn 1954, Hans Luhn of IBM proposed an algorithm for validating credit card numbers. The algorithm is useful to determine if a card number is entered correctly or if a credit card is scanned correctly by a scanner. Almost all credit card numbers are generated following this validity check, commonly know as the Luhn check or the Modulus 10 check, which can be described as follows. For illustration, consider the card number 4388576018402625.p  ol liDouble every second digit from right to left.

Negative 2859 pIm trying to write a program that will automatically generate FFI files between Javascript and another language Elm.p  pI was wondering, are there any tools which can take a Javascript module and list all the functions avaliable, possibly with their number of arguments If it can only do toplevel functions, thats okay, I realize that this gets complicated with closures and thunks and such.p  pIs it possible to do something like that from within Javascript as a form of introspection, or would I have to use some sort of parseranalyser If so, are there any such tools that exist and are fairly matureeasy to usep  pEDIT I realize that JavaScript is dynamic. My main goal is to generate FFI interfaces for libraries and APIs, so the things which are there should be fairly easy to reason about statically, since theyre not going to be changed dynamically. Im okay if its imperfect, Im looking for a tool to ease my writing of boilerplate rather than something that is guaranteed to be bulletproof.p

Negative 2859 pI have a wizard created using PyWizardPage.  It starts with a main page, and then the user is brought through two more pages asking him for input information.

I have three classes codeWizardPagecode which creates a regular page, codeMyWizardcode which creates the first page and calls helper functions to create and link all the subsequent pages, and codeWizardPageDisabledcode which is the same as codeWizardPagecode but has the timer that you introduced with the ability to disable the Next button.  I added this last class because this functionality may be needed for pages thats not just the first page of the wizard.  p  pNow, Ive come to a part when I see a problem.  codeWizardPagecode uses the codePyWizardPagecode constructor and codeMyWizardcode uses the codewx.Wizardcode constructor.  If I create codeWizardPageDisabledcode using the codePyWizardPagecode constructor, the line codeforwardBtn.Disablecode returns the codeNoneType has no attribute Disablecode error.  If I use the codewx.Wizardcode constructor, the page doesnt show up at all. p  pSo in addition to my issue above, I guess another clarification question is what is the difference between codePyWizardPagecode and codewx.Wizardcodep

Negative 2859 pIm working on a tool that analyzes code in .NET binaries using Mono.Cecil. As part of this, Im also checking the .pdb files for the binaries to link findings to source code lines.p  pThis works fine for most cases I get the right source file path and line number from the .pdb. However, in some cases I believe when the code is inside a coderegioncode, but not sure, the line number is set to code16707566code 0xFEEFEE. This is a lesserknown a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combjmstallarchive20050619feefeesequencepoints.aspx relnofollowcompiler featurea to indicate that the line is hidden from the user. The problem is, when the .pdb contains code0xFEEFEEcode as the line number, I cant do much with it  I cant easily tie my analysis findings back to the source.p  pI tried to change a number of Visual Studio options and then rebuild the code that Im analyzing but Im still getting code0xFEEFEEcode as line number for code in regions. For example, I tried disabling regions but it doesnt help. Plus the analyzed code is built from build scripts, not from the IDE.p  pIs it possible to tell the C compiler perhaps through a .csproj setting or in the registry to always emit real line numbers when it makes sense  for real source code lines and dont use these hidden line markersp

Negative 2859 pI got a container with a dynamic number of children sprites. Each child uses a Gestouch PanGesture to allow the user to move it around within the container.p  pI would like to invoke a Gestouch TransFormGesture on the container so that I can zoom and pan it pan using two fingers. I have a setup currently with a TransformGesture on the stage. My problem is naturally that if the user wants to zoom or pan, and sets down their first finger onto one of the child objects, that childs PanGesture starts. With my current setup the user would have to aim in between the children to successfully start the TransformGesturep  pId love it if anyone could enlighten me as to what would be a good strategy for solving this Slop on the PanGesture Is it wrong to use a PanGesture like I do Something more elegantp

However, because they are mostly created by some other libraries at many different places, I do not have direct control of calling codeinterncode during creation. So Im wondering if there is a way to force CPython 2.7 to do interning by default Or some clever workaround, such as override the str class, and somehow make python to invoke my new str class everywhere where str is called without modifying the source of the calling programs and libraries.  p

Negative 2859 pI am getting Log Data from various web applications in the following formatp  precodeSession    Timestamp    Event                Parameters 1          1            Started Session       1          2            Logged In            Usernameuser1 2          3            Started Session 1          3            Started Challenge    titleChallenge 1, level2 2          4            Logged In            Usernameuser2 codepre  pNow, a person wants to carry out analytics on this log data And would like to receive it as a JSON blob after appropriate transformations. For example, he may want to receive a JSON blob where the Log Data is grouped by codeSessioncode and codeTimeFromSessionStartcode and codeCountOfEventscode are added before the data is sent so that he can carry out meaningful analysis. Here I should returnp  precode[        session1,CountOfEvents3,Actions[TimeFromSessionStart0,EventSession Started, TimeFromSessionStart1, EventLogged In, Usernameuser1, TimeFromSessionStart2, EventStartd Challenge, titleChallenge 1, level2 ]   ,         session2, CountOfEvents2,Actions[TimeFromSessionStart0,EventSession     Started, TimeFromSessionStart2, EventLogged In, Usernameuser2]     ] codepre  pHere, codeTimeFromSessionStartcode, codeCountOfEventscode etc. [Lets call it synthetic additional data] will not be hard coded and I will make a web interface to allow the person to decide what kind of synthetic data he requires in the JSON blob. I would like to provide a good amount of flexibility to the person to decide what kind of synthetic data he wants in the JSON blob.p  pI am expecting the database to store around 1 Million rows and carry out transformations in a reasonable amount of time.p  pMy question is regarding choice of Database. What will be the relative advantages and disadvantages of using SQL Database such as PostgreSQL vs using NoSQL Database such as MongoDB. From whatever I have read till now, I think that NoSQL may not be able to provide enough flexibility of adding additional synthetic data. On the other hand, I may face issues of flexibility in data representation if I use SQL Database.p  pI think the storage requirement for both MongoDB and PostgreSQL will be comparable since I will have to build similar indices probably in both situations to speed up querying.p  pIf I use PostgreSQL, I can store the data in the following manner codeSessioncode and codeEventcode can be codestringcode, codeTimestampcode can be codedatecode and codeParameterscode can be codehstorecodekey value pairs available in PostgreSQL. After that, I can use SQL queries to compute the synthetic or additional data, store it temporarily in variables in a Rails Application which will interact with PostgreSQL database and act as interface for the person who wants the JSON blob and create JSON blob from it.p  pAnother possible approach is to use MongoDB for storing the log data and use a hrefhttpsgithub.commongoidmongoid relnofollowMongoida as an interface with Rails application if I can get enough flexibility of adding additional synthetic data for analytics and some performancestorage improvements over PostgreSQL. But, in this case, I am not clear of what will be the best way to store log data in MongoDB. Also, I read that MongoDB will be somewhat slower than PostgreSQL and is mainly meant to run in background.p  pemEditem From whatever I have read in the past few days, Apache Hadoop seems to be a good choice as well because of its greater speed over MongoDB being multithreaded.p  pstrongEditstrong I am not asking for opinions and would like to know the specific advantages or disadvantages of using a particular approach. Therefore, I dont think that the question is opinion based.p

Negative 2859 pHi I have a little question about these product combinations in prestashop. We are implementing a integration for our Warehouse Management System that imports products from prestashop via Webservice.p  pNow to the problem. Lets say there are a tshirt with different sizes Small, Medium, Large.p  pIf i import with apiproductsdisplayfull I got only one id for the sizes. How should i Map for example a tshirt Small with a unique id. p  pSome example i thaught of was if it was possible to combine the product id for example 1 with combination 14 than it will be 114. But its not a safe way because it may be a product id 11 with combination 4.p  pAnd in order import i got product attribute id. How to map it to correct combinationp

Negative 2859 pI have a WPF Window .NET 4.0 that opens another WPF window as a dialog using codeShowDialogcode.

Negative 2859 pAs a part of my model I have a class called Slide which has two children  QuizzSlide and ImageSlide. I also have another class called SlideView which is part of my views which has two children QuizzSlideView and ImageSlideView.p  pNow what I want to do is go through a collection of Slides and create the correct SlideViews to display them. Problem is, to instantiate a SlideView I need to know the type of the Slide. QuizzSlide should create a QuizzSlideView and ImageSlide should create an ImageSlideView. I see two options p  ol lipIntrospection. I dont like introspection because it means the class that builds the object has to exhaustively list the types of objects that it can deal with. If I add another type of Slides down the line, I have to modify the builder class.pli lipMaking the Slide create its associated View. So Id have a function getView that gets overridden by every child of Slide to create the correct View for that slide. This would work and it would make maintenance easier but it makes a horrible mess of the program as the model shouldnt contain references to the views it represents.pli ol  pThats pretty much it. Do I have any other options Any ideas on how to uncouple my models from my views, build the correct views depending on the model types AND avoid introspectionp  pThanksp

Negative 2859 pI can get the app ID from my running activity via codeactivity.getTaskIdcode. It will report back code185code. If I go to another app, and start my activity from a share button, it will be placed IN THAT apps stack. If I do codeactivity.getTaskIdcode it will report back code192code for example. I am assuming that an application process can only have one main task stack associated with it. How do I get that tasks ID I want to be able to know Hey Im running outside of your apps task stack. p  pI contemplated doing this by polling the taskId the first time my activity is created and set that as a member variable to my Application Class, but if my app is killed, and then started first from another application, it will have the incorrect task id as the AppTaskStackId. I havent found any API for this. p

Negative 2859 pAfter googling Im still unable to find a successful way to override the primary key added by Rails when working with SQLite. So far I have the following basic migrationp  precodeclass CreateRequests lt ActiveRecordMigration     def change         createtable requests, id false do t             t.string id             t.string name         end         end end codepre  pThe code above tells Rails to not add the default codeidcode primary key. Instead, I want to use an codeidcode of type string. p  pThe problem arises with the limitations of SQLites codeALTERcode command, which cannot add a primary key after creating the table. Thus, I tried this workaroundp  precodeclass CreateRequests lt ActiveRecordMigration     def change         createtable requests, id false do t             t.string id             t.string name         end              adaptertype  connection.adaptername.downcase.tosym             case adaptertype             when postgresql                  TODO             when sqlite                         execute ltltSQL                               DROP TABLE requests                     CREATE TABLE requests id TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT                 SQL             else                 raise NotImplementedError, Unknown adapter type adaptertype             end      end end codepre  pAfter running coderake dbmigratecode I get this outputp  precode 20140722082104 CreateRequests migrating   createtablerequests, idgtfalse    gt 0.0010s  execute          DROP TABLE requestsn          CREATE TABLE requests id      TEXT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXTn    gt 0.0010s  20140722082104 CreateRequests migrated 0.0030s  codepre  pSo, it seems everything went OK, but when I inspect the database file with a SQLite management program, table coderequestscode does not exist. p  pWhat am I doing wrong Thank you.p

Negative 2859 pI am trying to design a program in java to periodically every 100 milliseconds or so take screenshots of my display and compute the average pixel rgb values of the entire screen. I need this to be able to work with video games and iTunesQuicktime videos. However I have tried using JNA and robot to capture the screen and it only works when I am not capturing a video game in full screen or an iTunes video. For instance I tested my code by saving an image to examine and see what is happening. When I am in a video game I only see a screenshot of a blank window. I think this is because games use directx or openGL and communicate with the hardware differently than your typical app. p  pIf I use this a hrefhttpwww.lwjgl.orgwikiindex.phptitleTakingScreenShots relnofollowthisa method for capturing a screenshot instead of robot or JNA will this solve my problem It looks like it is copying over data from the openGL screen buffer.

Regardless of whether or not its a fullscreen DirectX or OpenGL application or not. Thanks in advance for your help. p

The site was from wordpress.com. I used duplicator to move it to a private host. I rebuilt the site on flavology.com. I then migrated the site to wallabiesgold.com on the same server.p  pEverything appears to be in order except new blog comments, You are more than welcome to make a comment and see what happens. Although I have deleted wordpress from flavology.com I know for a fact that the new comments were appearing over there for approval.p  pI have run search and replace plugin to try and replace urls. I have also used myphpadmin in an attempt to search and replace the urls in the database. I have also since deleted the database that was used by flavology.com so the comments are now simply being sent to a site that doesnt exist.p  pMy synopsis is that somewhere there is a leftover url that points the comments to flavology.com. I just dont know where that would be. I dont believe it points directly to the now deleted old database as when you attempt to comment you will see flavology.com appear in a box under the post.p  pAny advice would be appreciated.

Negative 2859 pI have assignment which asks one to write a function for any data type.The function is supposed to print the bytes of the structure and identify the total number of bytes the data structure uses along with differentiating between bytes used for members and bytes used for padding. p  pMy immediate reaction, along with most of the classes reaction was to use templates.

Negative 2859 pCalling all computer scientists  I need your expert advice p  pHeres my problemp  ul liI have a mapping application, and Ive divided the world into 10 million possible squares of fixed sizelatitudelongitude, ie doubledouble data type.  Lets call that data set D1.li liA second set of data, call it D2, is around 20,000 squares of the same size latitudelongitude, or doubledouble data type, and represents locations of interest in my app.li liWhen the user zooms in far enough, I want to display all the squares of interest that are in the present view, but not the ones outside the view, because thats way too many for the app to handle generating overlays, etc. without getting completely bogged down.li ul  pSo rather than submitting 20,000 overlay squares for rendering and letting the Mapkit framework manage what gets shown it completely chokes on that much data, here are a few things Ive tried to optimize performancep  p1 Put D2 in an array.  Iterate through every possible visible square on my view, and for each possible square do a lookup in D2 using Swifts find function to see if the corresponding element exists in that array.  If it exists, display it.  This is really slow  if my view has an area of 4000 squares viewable, I have to check 4000 squares  20000 points in the array  up to 80 million lookups  SLOW..p  p2 Put D2 in an array.  Iterate through D2 and for each element in D2, check if that element is within the bounds of my view.  If it is, display it.  This is better than 1 only takes 10 of the time of 1 but still on the slow sidep  p3 Put D2 in an array.  Iterate through D2 and create a new array D3 which filters out using Swifts array.filter method with a closure all datapoints outside the view, then submit just those points for rendering.  This is fastest about 2 of original time of 1 but still too slow depending on the data pattern, can still take several seconds of processing on an iphone4.p  pI have been thinking about dictionaries or other data structures.  Would I expect a dictionary populated with keylatitude,longitude and value  truefalse to be faster to look up than an array  Im thinking if a map view with bounds y2, y1, x2, x1, I could do a simple for loop to find all the dictionary entries in those bounds with value  true or even no value all Id really need is something like dictionarydata.existsx,y, unless a value is absolutely required to build a dictionary.  This would be much faster, but again it depends on how fast a dictionary is compared to an array.p  pLong story short is searching through a large dictionary for a key a lot faster than searching through an array  I contemplated sorting my array and building a binary search as a test, but figured dictionaries might be more efficient.  Since my array D2 will be built dynamically over time, Id rather commit much more timeresources per addition which are singular in nature in order to absolutely maximize lookup performance later which are orders of magnitude more data to sift through.p  pAppreciate anyall advice  are dictionaries the way to go  Any other suggestionsp

Negative 2859 pIm passing messages between Windows C client and Linux C server via TCP sockets.  C code uses protobufnet v2, Linux Googles version of protobuf.  Small test object that I pass has 6 fields  Enum, Int, String. I need help with two problemsp  ol lipC portion unable to deserialize data sent from Linux, unless the Memory stream used as the storage for the data is initialized with the binary array in the constructor.  Array can not be larger than the data sent from Linux  9 bytes in my case .  Code sample  byte[] data  new byte[9], copy data from the socket into the array. MemoryStream myStream  new MemoryStreamdata, pass myStream to Serializer.Deserialize... If I initialize MemoryStream without bynary buffer or with array of 1024 bytes, Deserialize will create empty object, without processing data.pli lipWhen I try to serialize the same object with the same values as Linux same in C the size of the data is 11 bytes vs 9 on Linux.  I checked the byte array in the debugger, C version has the same 9 fields as Linux data in the indexes 211 of the array.  Index 0 is 8 and index 1 is 9.  I can try to get around the problem, by modifying Linux deserialization code, just need to know, if I always have to deal with two extra fields at the beginning of the message.  Also, I can add two extra fields to messages generated on Linux if it going to fix my deserialization in C, just need to know how to generate values for these two fields.pli ol  pThanks. Alex.p

Negative 2859 pI initially setup a Web API not any expert with web api and followed someones tutorial online for passing in parameters to a simple get API call.p  pI had originally created a GET with query strings but as the tutorial showed how using POST allows me to pass JSON to an class object in POST API parameter, it seemed a good idea.p  pLater on one developer said this was bad practice Is it Should I always use GET instead of POST which in essence is what it should be anyway... a GET call, but I like the idea of passing parameters via an object and avoiding a long API call with query strings.p  pSop  precode.ajax     url apigetlist1param2yyyyampparam3kikkkkampparam488 etc     codepre  porp  precodevar params  ....  .ajax     url apigetlist,     data params  codepre  pWhat should I do, change the code back to using GET What about cachingp

Negative 2859 pI have been looking into a problem we have been seeing where downloads from S3 using the AmazonS3Client and a S3GetObjectRequest exhibit strange behaviour concerning the timeout parameter.p  pI have tried setting the timeout parameter to an arbitrarily low figure such as 3 seconds, to simulate a situation where some files would succeed and some would fail to test our product in fringe situations.p  pWhat we see is the request times out but never calls back to the delegate again with either an error or even a success.p  pIf we leave timeout alone and set connectionTimeout then this works as expected, and raises a call to  coderequestAmazonServiceRequest request didFailWithErrorNSError errorcode.p  pDoes anyone know what is supposed to happen to a request when the overall timeout is hit  It feels like a bug, but im not entirely sure. p  pDocumentation is slim on this, and the connectionTimeout parameter doesnt fit the bill for what we need to detect, although that works beautifully. p  pWe are using AWS SDK v1.7.1p  pThanks.p

Negative 2859 pIm working on a Quick Meeting type app. Where I want to check whether my app is installed on the system or not.p  pMy Application installer copies the plugin to Internet Plugins folder on Mac OSX and .mozilaplugins on Linux.p  pIm using this web pluginNPAPI to detect whether a application is installed on the system or not.p  pAs we know, web plugins can access using codenavigator.pluginscode.p  pIf plugin is found in plugins array then we were deciding to launch the application using custom url handler implemented by installed app, otherwise download the installer and ask user to install the app first. p  pThis works fine with Firefox and Safari but not with Google Chrome. Also Chromium doesnt support NPAPI plugins and Google Chrome is dropping support for it.p  pI thought of using Pepper Plugin, but it doesnt have any api to check installed apps nor to access local files say in users home dir.p  pAny idea how to do it. Any pointer on this would be helpful.p

Negative 2859 pI have c library .so. My coworker is working on c program which will call c library from his c program. I told him to create Wrapper.h and Wrapper.cpp and use pointer for passing around c objects in his c program. However, I found that he was trying to modify our c library source code by adding Wrapper.cpp and header into our library .so directly. For examplep  precodeclass A SetValueAint  class B SetValueBint  codepre  pIn his Wrapper.cpp, he wrote sth like thisp  precodeA a B b extern C SetValueAint a.SetValueAint  extern C SetValueBint b.SetValueBint  codepre  pThen he recompiled our c library and includes Wrapper.h in his c program.p  pWhat I told him is to do sth like this In my Wrapper.cppp  precodeextern C      A newClassA              return new A           void SetValueAA v, int i              vgtSetAi          B newClassB              return new B           void SetValueBB v, int i              vgtSetBi           void deleteClassAA v              delete v          void deleteClassBB v              delete v       codepre  pThen I just compiled my Wrapper.cpp and linked with our c library. In his c program, he just need to include Wrapper.h and compile his c code, and then compile Wrapper.o and main.ofrom main.c by using c compiler. p  pHis solution looks working too, he complained that the way I told him is more works. But I dont want him to change our c library coz nobody else will use Wrapper class from c library. Can you tell me which one is the better and whyp  pYes, I also dont like his way using global variable in his wrapper.p

Negative 2859 pIm using AudioRecord to record mic data while at the same time playing sounds with SoundPool. My problem is When I call startRecording on the AudioRecord, the SoundPool becomes choppy or stops completely. When I call stopRecording all the cued sounds come in at once. Is there a better library I should use Ive noticed the Buttons in the app are still responsive and are still able to play their default sounds.p  pSoundPool stops playing sounds even when the thread that called AudioRecord.startRecording has finished. It doesnt play sounds again until I call AudioRecord.stopRecording. Id like to do both at once. Seeing as the sounds Im playing are short sounds, I thought SoundPool was the correct class to use. If someone knows how the Android UI Button class plays its sounds I could copy that and it should work.p  pThis is in the emulator with the latest Android Studio 1.0.2p  pEdit MediaPlayer is worse, it fails after calling AudioRecord.startRecording strongandstrong it has much more latency than SoundPool when not recording at the same time.

Negative 2859 pI inherited a Mirth Connect v2.2.1 instance and am learning how it works. Im now learning how globalChannelMap variables work, and Im stumped by a misbehaving filter on a source connector. In theory I can edit a csv text file in the Mirth Connect folders directory to update the globalChannelMap that is called by the filter. But in practice the csv file is updated yet the source connector filter continues to call a prior globalChannelMap for the txt file. What step am I missing to update the globalChannelMap Is there a simple way to output the current contents of a globalChannelMapp

I want to add a parameterless constructor to my class and when I do library compiles fine but when I try to use the class in a sketch the compiler gives me the rather obtuse request for member setDigit in sevenSegmentLed, which is of nonclass type SevenSegmentLedp  pThe simplest example code is belowp  precodeifndef SevenSegmentLedh define SevenSegmentLedh include Arduino.h  class SevenSegmentLed    public     void setDigitint digit     SevenSegmentLed   endif  include Arduino.h include SevenSegmentLed.h  SevenSegmentLedSevenSegmentLed     void SevenSegmentLedsetDigitint digit            include SevenSegmentLed.h SevenSegmentLed sevenSegmentLed  void setup    sevenSegmentLed.setDigit4   void loop     put your main code here, to run repeatedly   codepre  pHowever if I change the constructor signature to codeSevenSegmentLedint wtfcode and instantiate it thus codeSevenSegmentLed sevenSegmentLed1code it compiles just fine. So as the parameter says, WTFp

Negative 2859 pSuppose there are one producer and multiple consumer and they use a codestdqueuecode, in order to protect the data in codestdqueuecode, a mutex must be used when accessing this codestdqueuecode.p  pBut what about using two separate locks One for codepopcode and one for codepushcode I think it might be faster using two separate locks.p  pI looked at the STL source code. The codestdqueuecode is implemented by codestddequecode by default. codepopfrontcode and codepushbackcode use two separate iterators to access the data, one for the first element, and one for the last element. p  precodevoid pushfrontconst valuetypeamp x     if thisgtMimpl.Mstart.Mcur  thisgtMimpl.Mstart.Mfirst         thisgtMimpl.constructthisgtMimpl.Mstart.Mur  1, x      else          Mpushfrontauxx        void pushback     if thisgtMimpl.Mfinish.Mcur  thisgtMimpl.Mfinish.Mfirst         thisgtMimpl.constructthisgtMimpl.Mfinish.Mur  1, x      else          Mpopbackaux       codepre  pSo, when one thread is codepopcodeing the queue, another thread cuts in and tries to codepushbackcode. Because these two operations use different iterators which points to the two different end point of codedequecode, so it seems that these two operations will all be okp
Negative 2859 pI am working with potentially large xml files where my application only cares about a very small subset of the data contained in the file.  So I was hoping to avoid loading the entire xml document into DOM.p  pI have been successfully using Apache Xerces C with the Sax2 api to extract data directly from an xml file contained in a zip archive, using custom implementations of codexercescBinInputStreamcode and codexercescInputSourcecodep  pHowever, now we want to apply modifications to a small subset of the nodes in the xml document reading the original, and applying changes into a new xml file in a new zip archive. I was hoping to avoid loading the entire document into DOM just to modify a few nodes.p  pIt would be nice to leverage the work Ive already done with SAX2, but it appears that the SAX2 api is primarily oriented around reading documents.  I could handle all SAX2 events, and write the information out to the new file as they occur, but Im having difficulty locating xerces api functionality that would, for example, aid with handling xml entities I really dont want to rewrite e.g. xml entity handling myself and other encoding issues.p  pI also noticed that xerces provides a codexercescBinOuputStreamcode which would appear to be what I would want to derive from in order to directly serialize to a zip archive, but I havent found a place where I could plug such a custom output stream into the xerces api. I also havent been able to locate a corresponding output analogue for codexercescInputSourcecode.p  pDoes xerces c provide any native functionality for writing xml documents in a streaming fashionp

Negative 2859 pI have just taken over as a developer for a company. They host their development site on Rackspace. When I arrived, this server was spun down. Upon bringing it back up, I discovered that the IP address of that server points to the live website. There must be some kind of forwarding in place I assume that it is through Rackspace that does this. How can I fix this I searched for settings on Rackspace to no avail. I would like to be able to access this dev site at least through the direct IP address until the network admin reappoints the develoment domain name to proper IP.p

Negative 2859 pI have created java based web service and noticed an interesting way wsimport treats jaxb parametersreturn objects.  When a web method returns a jaxb object wsimport creates it as a subobject Nested of that method.p  pAn example... let us say I have a method called GetRoles that returned a jaxb generated object called RoleAdministration.  Wsimport generates the following nested object GetRoles.RoleAdministration.p  pHowever if the same method returned a plain old serialized java object it gets returned by wsimport as RoleAdministration.  This seems to be better to me since I can use this for other web methods that happen to use it as a parameter or a return type.p  pA Why does the object being jaxb generated change the way wsimport generates it B Is there anything special to force wsimport to flatten parameter and return objectsp  pAs requestedp  precodeltxml version1.0gt ltproject xmlnshttpmaven.apache.orgPOM4.0.0

Is there a way to do that  p  pIf not, is there a way to manually initialize a codeViewcode in the controller, where I already have the instance variables Im passing to the mailer  That doesnt seem to be an ideal solution, because Im using codeDelayedJobcode, and the code for adding the note would be run before the email is actually sent.

Negative 2859 pIm familiar with creating Eclipse menus.p  pI wish to offer the user a very deep amp broad set of menu actions. Creation of these contextsensitive actions takes an amount of processing time.  I do not wish to generate all of them at once.  I wish to generate them as the user progressively navigates deeper through the menu structure.  So, for example, if a menu tier contains days of the week, and the user selects strongemMondayemstrong, I will then offer strongemAMemstrong or strongemPMemstrong, then a list of twohour periods strongem12001400emstrong, strongem14001600emstrong, strongem16001800emstrong, etc , then finally strongemCreate appointmentemstrong, strongemRegister as availableemstrong and strongemRegister as unavailableemstrong. The final set of actions may incur a database roundtrip to determine availability.p  pClearly, the alternative to this strategy is to generate a menu tree as required with many, many actions and many database roundtripsp  p[thats not the actual set of actions, its [hopefully] and easy to understand example].p  pI cant find an Eclipse API that lets me create MenuSubmenu actions progressively as the user navigates down through the menu tree.p  pCan anybody point me to itp
