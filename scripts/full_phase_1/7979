Ive already changed the code to use PreparedStatement but given the way the existing code was structured, an escape function would make the code changes much simpler to review and maintain I prefer easy to maintain code unless there is a compelling reason for the extra complexity. Also PreparedStatements are handled differently by the database, so this could expose us to bugs in the database that we havent run into before, requiring more testing before releasing to production.p  pa hrefhttpcommons.apache.orglangapireleaseorgapachecommonslangStringEscapeUtils.htmlApache StringEscapeUtils escapeSQLa only escapes single quotes.p  pPostscript There are a lot of subtleties in the environment I inherited that I deliberately avoided in my question.p  pTwo points to consider p  p1 Prepared statements are not a panacea and do not provide 100 protection against SQL injection. Some database drivers instantiate parameterised queries using unsafe string concatenation, rather than precompiling the query to a binary form. Also, if your SQL relies on stored procedures, you need to ensure the stored procedures do not themselves build queries in unsafe ways. p  p2 Most prepared statement implementation bind the statement to the database connection the statement was instantiated on. If you are using database connection pooling, you need to be careful tobr use the prepared statement reference only with the connection it was prepared on. Some pooling mechanisms do implement this transparently. Otherwise you could pool the prepared statements as well or simplest but more overhead create a new prepared statement for every query.p

Negative 7979 pHere is simplified version of my requirementp  pI have a java class say Processor that contains a method say bigProcess all it does is connect to a file server, download a specified file once that is done save the file in DB and after that update some of the DB fields in different tables.p  pFor each of the subtasks like download file, save in DB, update fields in t1 etc it uses different methods.p  pThe processor class is invoked every 2 hours and it has to process say around 30 to 40 requests for each invocation.

Negative 7979 pI am currently trying to build a ControlTemplate for an ItemsControl that uses the Grid as its ItemsPanel where each item is stacked horizontally and delimited with a GridSplitter. p  pThe basic goal is to have a dynamic bindable ItemsControl where all items stack up in a row and where each item can be resized with a splitter. p  pThere are two things I cant wrap my head around How is the GridSplitter supposed to end up automatically between each item How do I set Grid.Column for each item.p  pIf this cant be done with a simple control template what would be a common and good way to implement something like this Do I need to write a new ItemsControl for thisp  pI need actual GridSplitter controls so there can be custom ControlTemplates for them.

Negative 7979 pHow can we detect when threads are running in a python applicationp  pMotivation We were recently debugging a large Python application that had several customer supplied modules that were supplied without source code. Unbeknowst to us and our customer, one of these modules would launch threads under very specific and undocumented conditions. These threads caused unexpected side effects which changed our environment in unexpected ways. The entire debugging scenario would be funny if it wasnt my team stuck with the task of figuring out where the side effects were coming from p  pWe finally discovered what was happening when one of the threads raised an untrapped error. Had this not happened, we would still be pulling our hair out.p  pSo, this is why were looking for a way to detect the presence of threads in our application.p  pHere are some possible techniques we came up with and the corresponding challengesp  ol lipGrep source code for threadthreading. Challenge We dont always have access to source code.

Challenge Only insures these modules were loaded  doesnt prove that threads are currently running.pli lipMonkeypatch the Python standard threadthreading library to leave us clues as to when threads have been created.

Negative 7979 pI have been playing a bit with Silverlight and try to port my Silverlight 3.0 application to Silverlight 4.0.  My application loads different XAP files and upon a user request create an instance of a Xaml user control and adds it to the main container, in a sort of MEF approach in order I can have an extensible and pluggable application. p  pThe application is pretty huge and to keep acceptable the performances and the initial loading I have built up some helper classes to load in the background all pages and user controls that might be used later on.p  pOn Silverlight 3.0 everything was running smoothly without any problem so far. Switching to SL 4.0 I have noticed that when the process approaches to create the instances of the user controls the layout freezes unexpectedly for a minute and sometimes for more. Looking at the task manager the memory usage of IE jumps from 50MB to 400MB and sometimes up to 1.5 GB.p  pIf the process wont take that much the layout is rendered properly even though the memory usage is still extremely high. Otherwise everything crashes due to out of memory exception.p  pRunning the same application compiled in SL3, the memory used is about 200MB when all the usercontrols are loaded. Time spent to load the application in SL3 is about 10 seconds, while it takes up to 3 mins in SL4 There are no transparencies, no opacities set, no effects and animations in the layout.p  pUser controls are instantied on the fly and added or removed in the visual tree on purpose when the user switches from one screen to another. The resources are all cleaned properly when a usercontrol is removed from the visual tree to allow the GC to operate in the background.p  pI may do something wrong but I could not figure out where exactly nail out the source of this problem. As far as I know there is no memory profiler in SL4 that can help me out to find where to look at. But again I could not be updated on new debugging tools available.p

Negative 7979 pSo I have this weird problem with jquery doing a ajax post with a ruby object. I have 2 options. 1. formid.serialize. I know this works. But my form simply has too many fields, and it is a little too inconvenient to manage them in the form 2. Second option, the rails controller is constructing a ruby object along the way as the form is being edited. This is super convenient only if I can simply stick in the object in the ajax post request. Apparently I am able to, with something like this...p  precodesomefunction    .ajax type post, url action, data  postdata lt rubyobject.tojson gt   codepre  pIf you wonder this works, it does. dunno how and why But there is a small problem. the ruby object has a array of hashes within a hash, like this  [  ]  It appears that someone somewhere is converting that array to a hash with keys which are indices of that array. So in the action, if i print the parameters, I get     . So can someone tell me how not to get this and get back exactly the original object structurep

Negative 7979 pIm working on a database for stat keeping for a sports club where I help administrate some events.

The idea being that scores are the raw data I need to record for each competitor, with foreign keys to the competitor and stages table.  Rather than having fired and aggregate matches, I decided to approach it as matches being aggregates of one or more stages, and tournaments can have one or more matches aggregates.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comaZJnV.png altERDp  pI left out some of the lookup tables indicated by the other foreign keys since they dont directly relate to the matter at hand which I guess is Is this the correct way to go about this, or would I be better off to skip the matchesstages separation  Would there be a way to reimplement this parentchild relationship between matches and stages in a single table via a selfjoin p

Negative 7979 pOk, this is a tough one.p  pstrongIntroductionstrong My idea is to attach an instanciated QueryBuilder class which I wrote, to a PropertyGrid. The QueryBuilder class now contains a couple of fields, which are hardcoded like in the example below. Thus allowing a user to specify, which fields should be used in a query in what way sorted, grouped, and so on. After the user having specified all the settings to these properties by code or via the PropertyGrid GUI, the QueryBuilder is able to produce a query. Everything is working fine like that. Pseudo codep  precodeclass QueryBuilder    public QBField name get set   public QBField prename get set   public QBField zip get set    ...    public void QueryBuilder      name  new QBField     prename  new QBField      ...       public getQuery       logic to build the query      class QBField    public bool shown get set   public bool sortby get set   public bool groupby get set  codepre  pstrongChallengestrong Now instead of hardcoding each field as public properties in the QueryBuilder class, I was wondering how I could use i.e. a codeListltstringgtcode containing all my fields to populate my instanciated QueryBuilder with these properties.p  pSo this leads to three questionsp  ol lipCould this be accomplished by somehow overriding GetProperties of the Type of the QueryBuilder class, and if yes, how is it best done pli lipHow can I then iterate through all of these at runtime generated QBField properties and instanciate them Idea PropertyDescriptors and Activatorspli lipHow can I iterate through all of these properties to read the values of each QBField object The problem I ran in was, that when reading the Properties of QBField with reflection and trying getValueobj, null, of course the first parameter needed is an object, which I do not know since I have lots of these QBField objects. Perhaps putting all my QBFields into a codeListltQBFieldgtcode and iterating through it Would that work in this example pli ol  pIm just a bit lost but I feel that Im very close to the solution.

I think this is how to do what I want, but if Im barking up the wrong tree please let me know.p  pIf anyone here can explain it better for me Id be most thankful.p

Negative 7979 pSo, I have a TriangleAABB collision algorithm and I have it returning the triangle that the AABB collided with. I was hoping with the 3 vectors of the triangle and the directionmagnitude of the movement would let me determine a deflected vector so that when you run against the wall at an angle you move slower, depending on the angle of collision, but along side the wall. This would remove the sticky collision problem with only moving when there is not a collision. Any suggestions or references would be greatly appreciated Thanks.p

Negative 7979 pI need to merge about 30 gziped text files, each about 1015GB compressed, each containing multiline records, each sorted by the same key. The files reside on an NFS share, I have access to them from several nodes, and each node has its own codetmpcode filesystem. What would be the fastest way to go about itp  pSome possible solutionsp  pA. Leave it all to codesort mcode. To do that, I need to pass every input file through codeawkcodecodesedcodecodegrepcode to collapse each record into a line and extract a key that would be understood by codesortcode. So I would get something likep  pcodesort m k [...] ltpreprocess file1 [...] ltpreprocess filen  postprocesscodep  pB. Look into pythons codeheapq.mergecode.p  pC. Write my own C code to do this. I could merge the files in small batches, make an OMP thread for each input file, one for the output, and one actually doing the merging in RAM, etc.p  pOptions for all of the abovep  pD. Merge a few files at a time, in a tournament.p  pE. Use several nodes for this, copying intermediate results in between the nodes.p  pWhat would you recommend I dont have much experience about secondary storage efficiency, and as such, I find it hard to estimate how either of these would perform.p
Negative 7979 pIm using a php wrapper to find all unread sms messages from my google voice phone number. The problem Im seeing though is if I send a text message to my google voice I can see the new text message I sent using the php wrapper. Then if I refresh the script its blank, this is because the php wrapper allows me to mark that text message as read. But if I send another text message from the same phone number then run the php wrapper script to check for the latest unread sms messages it now shows me 2 messages, the first message I sent and the last message I sent. It appears Google Voice just appends the second message to the first message I sent, is there a way to break that up so that I only see the latest unread message from each text message received I rely on the message being sent to determine what to send back and if all the messages show up because the latest message was marked as unread they will get back a reply times how many times they texted my google voice number. Hope this makes sense. Perhaps there is a way to instead of marking it unread it just deletes itp

Negative 7979 pI like how you can capture breakpoints as Intellitrace events.

Id love to be able to capture breakpoint events in intellitrace and just let the code execute without actually breaking on the breakpoints.p  pIve also used Console statements as captured intellitrace events, but breakpoints are much easier to add F9 as opposed to pasting a codeConsole.WriteLine...code everywhere, and I can add and disable new breakpoints at runtime, whereas if I want to add or remove a Console based event at runtime, I have to stop the program, adddelete, and restart.p  pAre there any good ways to capture intellitrace events in this wayp

When I run the command it says its listening on port 5357, even though I have restricted the DCOM port range to 50005020 on both machines.

Negative 7979 pAssume that you want to build a copy of an codeImmutableSetcodecodeListcodecodeMapcode object but filter out some of the original entries. One way to implement that is the followingp  precodeImmutableList.copyOfIterables.filtermyObject, myObject.EQUALS codepre  pwhere codemyObject.EQUALScode is a predicate for the codeIterables.filtercode operation. I think this is a pretty elegant and easytoread implementation. However, one builds two list objects first through the codeIterables.filter...code call, second through codeImmutableList.copyOf...code which is very inefficient.p  pDoes anybody know of a more efficient way to do itp  pI guess the best thing would be to add filter predicates to the codeImmutableSetcodecodeListcodecodeMapcode builders so that the object must be constructed only once. But unfortunately there is no such parameter.p

Negative 7979 pI just happen to ponder of a OO concept which may sound quite trivial but I dont know why I find it quite confusing.p  pAnyway, I am thinking for example, if I have an Animal class and a Location class. And I only allow one animal to be at one location at any time. So it is kind of like a 1to1 relationship. At the same time, I wish that the Animal and Location classes do not need some kind of bidirectional reference so that they are kept loosely coupled. If say I have thisp  precodeclass Animal     private Location loc     public Animalint x, int y        loc  new Locationx,y         public static newAnimalLocation[][] map, int x, int y        ifmap[x][y]  null           return new Animalx, y        else return null   class Location extends Point     public Locationint x, int y        superx, y       public static void mainString[] args     populates a map    Location[][] map  new Location[10][10]    forint x0 xlt10 x        forint y0 ylt10 y           map[x][y]  new Locationx, y                Animal dog  new Animal2, 4    dog is at location 2,4    Animal cat  new Animal5, 6    cat is at location 5,6     But this does not restrict a constraint requirement that there should only be one animal at any one point    Animal horse  new Animal2, 4    now, horse is at the same location as dog but we only wanted one location to have one animal     Animal rabbit  Animal.newAnimalmap, 20, 50    rabbit is null because it is out of the map size  codepre  pFrom this, I foresee 2 problems.p  pFirst, because my location does not know if an animal is already on it, many animals can all be pointing to a same location on the map array. This would violate the 11 multiplicity constraint that I wanted. In my case, I let the Animal to own the Location. this could the be reason why this could happen. If say I let the Location to own the Animal, this could be solved. But in a case if I want to know where my Animal is at, I need to loop through the entire map just to find where one of my Animals location is Alternatively, I can keep a bidirectional reference but this would cause the classes to be highlycoupled.p  pThe second problem that I feel could be a problem is the design in the Animal class. I have a static newAnimal method to instantiate new animals. I did it this way because I thought allowing the caller to create new Animal instance directly from the constructor may allow an out of range coordinate input. But I still find the design very awkward.p  pI am using Java codes in my example. And I am thinking the design within the class objects itself and is not involving the database yet.p  pAny suggestions to improve the two issues I raised could be great. Thanksp

Negative 7979 pIm having trouble with default model binding naming convention when there is a child property. For examplep  pI have a ViewModel which looks something like thisp  precodepublic class UserViewModel      public User BusinessObject  get set   codepre  pMy User class has a property called NetworkLoginp  pMy View has something like this                                      lt Html.LabelFormodel  model.BusinessObject.NetworkLogin                                                       lt Html.TextBoxFormodel  model.BusinessObject.NetworkLogin                     AutoFill                                  br p  pAnd my controller, what Id like to do, isp  precode    [HttpGet]     public ActionResult UserIndexstring networkLogin   codepre  pThe problem The input parameter networkLogin is always null.

Ours is a very complex application and there are chances that some code is directly committing the data.  Is there a way to debug the commit to the database  Either from java or from the database.

Negative 7979 pemThe setupem I have a toplevel window with a region defined created with codeSetWindowRgncode, and I have a child element that is moved with codeSetWindowPoscode such that some of its pixels then overlap the clipped portion of the parents window region.p  pemThe resultem Those pixels become filled with fully opaque, fully white pixels, instead of remaining fully transparent since its outside its parents region.  It isnt that the child window is being drawn when it shouldnt, as the offending pixels are white regardless of what the child window looks like.p  pBelow, the small orange child window has been moved around a bit along the edge of the parent.  This only happens along the edges that have a transparent window region so the white pixels are always constrained within the maximum rectangle of the parent window.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxHDCN.png altenter image description herep  pThings correct themselves if the parent window is hidden and then shown just invalidating and forcing a redraw does not clear the white pixels.p  pThis has been observed on both Vista and 7.

Negative 7979 pI have an .Net Framework 4.0, ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC 3 web application hosted on a Windows 7  IIS 7.5. IIS logging is enabled on this machine and set to log in W3C mode.p  pThe application is compiled by using the Release configuration and has been deployed to IIS with codeltcompilation debugfalsecode attribute set explicitly. The Web.config specifies the use of SQL Server based session state.p  pI have added the following statements in Global.asax in BeginRequest and EndRequest events respectively.

The average timetaken as per IIS tallys with the value shown in Visual Studio load test report.p  pThe stopwatch timetaken only accounts for 32 of timetaken as reported by IIS logs  Visual Studio. Where does the other 68 time go p  pstrongUpdate 1strong I set the session state to InProc and reran the load test. In this scenario the difference between the average time reported by stopwatch and average timetaken reported by IIS logs grew to more than 70 Where is all that time going p  pstrongUpdate 2strong Peter  I tried out the failed request tracing by putting a trace rule to log on status code of 200. Next, I ran the load test with 20 concurrent users for approx 1.5 minutes. Went through last 50 trace files and found that the Time Taken field in that report had range of 750ms to 1300ms. The Visual Studio report showed avg. time taken as 2300ms. In the report, using the compact view, I see that the time taken changes between the following transitions      1 AspNetStart  AspNetAppDomainEnter      2 ManagedPipelineHandlerstart ManagedPipelineHandlerend.  The 2 item is probably my applications code. Still there is a big difference between max of timetaken as per failed request logs i.e. 1300ms and the avg. timetaken as shown by Visual Studio 2300ms. How to find accounting for that Thanks for this great tip thoughp

Negative 7979 pIve a tomcat application with jsf 1.1p  pCase My application has a jsp let name it create.jsp that contains a form to create a Business Object imagine type person. One of the attributes of this Business Object is a relation to itself the BO person, has an attribute father, that is also of type person. For this porpose, in the jsp, I have a selectable, and a button. The button enables to create new Business Object in this case, a person. Therefore, the jsp show in the popup is the same that the one shown in the main windowp  pProblem Im facing wrong behaviours in the main window.p  pCause Ive studied the case, and the reason of the problem is the ids of the views stored in the server. When the users requires a new page, the server creates a view ViewRoot and stores it at the session. The jsp path is used as the id of the View. When the user submits a form, it will rehuse the same view stored in the session. The problem in my case is that the popup ViewRoot, and the main window ViewRoot share the same id. So when the main window is shown, its viewRoot will be stored let say id create.jsp, but, when the popup is shown, its viewRoot will overwrite the main one in session. After closing the popup, the user will try to submit the main page, but in the server, there is no such a ViewRoot.p  pPossible Solution Ive been thinking on changing the ViewRoot id creation, but I thing that this is not feasible at least if I dont modify the jsf library.p  pOLD TEXT I have a jsp with a form let name it create.jsp, that opens a popup window. This popup will also use create.jsp . Due to that JSF viewid, is fomed by the jsp path, both pages will share same id. So when the popup is displayed, the view stored in the session for the main page is overwritten by the new one. Because of this, the application is not working properly.p  pIs there any way to change the ids of the views anyone has any solutionp  pThanksp

The controller class lib project is referenced in the windows form project.p  pI have created interfaces that are implemented by the Entity classes the Biz tier. I am using these interfaces in the winform project to store a reference of the entity class objects that are returned by various functions into the windows form. I am doing this since i do not want to directly reference the Biz logic layed in the windows form project and I need a loosely coupled solution. Only the Contoller classlib is referenced in the windows form. However when i use the interface to store the object reference of the entity class in the windows form project it gives a compile error asking me to reference the Biz logic layer project. The interface has the same declarations as the actual entity class.p  pHow should i solve this problem.p

Negative 7979 pDeveloping iOS application which uses CoreAudio framework, I am dealing with IMHO nonsense behavior of SDL reg. playing audio. SDL plays audio in loop, and only way how to trigger playback is to call codeSDLPauseAudio0code, and the only way how to stop it without other side effects, which I wont talk about here is to call codeSDLPauseAudio1code. As far as I know.p  pWhat is the problem  for me in SDL here Simply  next call to codeSDLPauseAudio1code actually RESUMES the playback, causing the framework to play some emmessem before asking for emnewem sound data. This is because of the way how SDLCoreAudio.c implements the playback loop. p  pIt means, that SDL does not implement STOP, it implements just PAUSERESUME and incorrectly manages audio processing. It means, that if you play sampleA, and want to play sampleB later on, you will hear also fragments of sampleA while expecting just to hear playback of sampleB.p  pIf am wrong, please correct me. p  pIf not, heres my diff, that I used to implement also STOP behavior as soon as I finish playing sampleA, I call codeSDLPauseAudio2code so that playback loop quits and next call to SDLPauseAudio0 starts it again, this time by playing emno messem from sampleA, but correctly playing just data from smapleB.p  precodeIndex srcaudiocoreaudioSDLcoreaudio.c   srcaudiocoreaudioSDLcoreaudio.c  srcaudiocoreaudioSDLcoreaudio.c  250,6 250,12               abuf  ampioDatagtmBuffers[i]              SDLmemsetabufgtmData, thisgtspec.silence, abufgtmDataByteSize                  if 2  thisgtpaused                     this changes pause behavior to stop behavior  next             plyaing starts from beginning, i.e. it wont resume            thisgthiddengtbufferOffset  thisgthiddengtbufferSize                  return 0       codepre  pI am shamed that I edited SDL code, but I have no connection to authors and havent found any help around.

Negative 7979 pIm trying to find a way to keep track of files even when they are moved or renamed in the file system.p  pOne idea I had was to use the new UserDefinedFileAttributeView in Java 7 and create a custom file attribute as a sort of custom id. I thought that this might work on different platforms Windows and Mac primarily. But I cant get it to work. Even trying the example on this page  a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialessentialiofileAttr.html relnofollowhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialessentialiofileAttr.htmla  When I get to this linep  pUserDefinedFileAttributeView view  Files.getFileAttributeViewfile, UserDefinedFileAttributeView.classp  pI only get a null value for the view variable, and then the program stops with a nullpointer exception.p  pI then found that there is a perhaps easier way to do this for Mac at least use the BasicFileAttributes fileKey attribute. I tried this, and the fileKey seems to stay the same even if I move the file or rename it. However, it also says that this functionality is platform dependent, and I remember reading somewhere that it doesnt work on Windows...p  pSo first of all, is the fileKey method a stable way of doing this on Mac And if so, what can I do for the same functionality for Windows Anyone know why I get null on the UserDefinedFileAttributeView Because if I could get that to work it should be crossplatform I guess.p  pThis is not something that needs to be super robust and scalable, it is just a small helper application Im developing, but it needs to be at least reliable in identifying files when moved or renamed...p

Negative 7979 pIn my attempt to make a simple game using SDL under Linux, I noticed that using the normal X11 backend, it runs at about 60 FPS at 800x600x32, and drops at 20 FPS or so at 1024x768x32, which is a quite massive drop for a simple 2D game with a sprite and some 32x32 tiles. Ive done some researches and found out that X server doesnt allow his clients to directly access the video hardware, forcing the program to use software surfaces, and many CPU cycles. Some of the provided solutions said to set the envvar SDLVIDEODRIVER to dga, and to use the XFree86 DGA driver to bypass the X server.

Negative 7979 pI seem to have some problems wrapping my head around the concept about how to best handle updating and deleting from lists in MVC. Ill try to explain my problem with a short example. From the Entity Framework I have my object Positionp  precodepublic int Quantity  get set   public int PositionNumber  get set   public string ArticleNumber  get set   public string Name  get set   public string Remark  get set  codepre  pNow Ive heard that its best to make a ViewModel foreach View with the used properties so to make it simple the ViewModel looks the same. In the controller we return a list of Positions to the view by mapping the Model to the ViewModel. Now the view displays textboxes for Quantity and Remark which the user can change. He can also delete a position. Now when posting the data the user entered I do something like thisp  precode[HttpPost]     public ActionResult IndexIEnumerableltShoppingCartPositionModelgt shoppingCartPositions              var positions  shoppingCartManager.GetActiveShoppingCart.Positions.Values.OrderByp gt p.PositionNumber.ToList          if FormCollection.AllKeys.Anyk gt k.ContainsRemove                      string key  FormCollection.AllKeys.Wherek gt k.ContainsRemove.First             int start  key.LastIndexOf[  1             int end  key.LastIndexOf]             int difference  end  start              int index             if int.TryParsekey.Substringstart, difference, out index                              shoppingCartManager.DeleteShoppingCartPositionpositions.ElementAtindex                               else                      if ModelState.IsValid                               for int i  0 i lt positions.Count i                                      var position  positions.ElementAti                     var cartPosition  shoppingCartPositions.ElementAti                      position.PositionNumber  cartPosition.PositionNumber                     position.Quantity  cartPosition.Quantity                     position.Remark  cartPosition.Remark                                   shoppingCartManager.UpdateShoppingCartPositionspositions                                var cartPositions  GetShoppingCartPositionsModel         UpdateModelcartPositions          return ViewcartPositions.ToList      codepre  pMy problem is how will this work if in the meantime another user has deleted an object or even added a new position inbetween the others Would it be best to make a hidden field on the view and map by that And to detect updates save a changed date and display a hidden field on the view for that aswell Because I think if Id simply check the date update like this I would always have the newest update date and I dont think in the few seconds the service needs to update an item any other user can change the data. I hope this explaines my issue and thanks to those trying to help me find a way to do this.p

Negative 7979 pLately, Ive started experimenting with graphs, mainly for the entertainment value. Wikipedia is full of information on graphs, and I try to learn the theory while implementing some of the algorithms I find there shortest path, DFS etc. I also try to make routines to classify graphs tree, cyclic, planar etc, detect certain propertiesclicques, leafs etc and so forth. Great fun, although quite nerdy. p  pAs my library grows, I find myself spending way too much time constructing graphs to test my code. If I want to test my codeTGraph.IsTreecode method, I need to construct some graphs that emareem trees, and some that emarentem trees. I could generate graphs randomly, but then I wouldnt know what my method emshouldem return.p  pSo my question is Does anyone know of a test suite for graph programming What Im looking for is a collection of graphs in some well defined format, where theres also some information about the graph classification, maximal clique, shortest path between some vertices etc.p  pI know this exists for chess programs and the like, but I havent been able to find something similar for graphs.p

Negative 7979 pI have created an echo server under UDP, and am working on a client that splits up a given file into packets and transfers it to a server, which then returns the packets to be reassembled by the client.p  pSending the individual packets works just fine.

Negative 7979 pThanks for the time to look. I have a weird problem. my Launch image AKA Splash screen seems to automatically be tied to my App icon. so I cant change one with out changing the other.

Negative 7979 pIve got this setupp  ul liSingle page app that generates HTML content using Javascript.

So essentially, as far as Google knows, there is no content whatsoever.p  pI was thinking of serving cached content to search bots only. So, when a search bot hits domain.compageid, it loads cached content, but if a user loads the same page, it sees normal Javascript injected content.p  pA proposed solution for this is using hashbangs, so Google can automatically convert those URLs to alternative URLs with an escapedfragment string. On the server side, I could then redirect those alternative URLs to cached content. As I wont use hashbangs, this doesnt work.p  pTheoretically I have everything in place. I can generate a sitemap.xml and I can generate cached HTML content, but one piece of the puzzle is missing.p  pMy question, I guess, is this how can I filter out search bot access, so I can serve those bots the cached pages, while serving my users the normal JS enabled appp  pOne idea was parsing the HTTPUSERAGENT string in .htaccess for any bots, but is this even possible and not considered cloaking Are there other, smarter waysp

Negative 7979 pA quick introductionbr Were developing a positioning system that works the following way. Our camera is situated on a robot and is pointed upwards looking at the ceiling. On the ceiling we have something like landmarks, thanks to whom we can compute the position of the robot. It looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKzIQj.png altenter image description herep  pOur problembr The camera is tilted a bit 04 degrees I think, because the surface of the robot is not perfectly even. That means, when the robot turns around but stays at the same coordinates, the  camera looks at a different position on the ceiling and therefore our positioning program yields a different position of the robot, even though it only turned around and wasnt moved a bit.p  pOur current hardcoded solutionbr Weve taken some test photos from the camera, turning it around the lens axis. From the pictures weve deduced that its tilted ca. 4 degrees in the up direction of the picture. Using some simple geometrical transformations weve managed to reduce the tilt effect and find the real camera position. On the following pictures the grey dot marks the center of the picture, the black dot is the real place on the ceiling under which the camera is situated. The black dot was transformed from the grey dot its position was computed correcting the grey dot position. As you can easily notice, the grey dots form a circle on the ceiling and the black dot is the center of this circle.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnqbth.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comwVqEt.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoxRbe.png altenter image description herep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comS2EzJ.png altenter image description herep  pThe problem with our solutionbr Our approach is completely unportable. If we moved the camera to a new robot, the angle and direction of tilt would have to be completely recalibrated. Therefore we wanted to leave the calibration phase to the user, that would demand takings some pictures, assessing the tilt parameters by him and then setting them in the program. My question to you is can you think of any better more automatic solution to computing the tilt parameters or correcting the tilt on the picturesp

Negative 7979 pWhen I decided to teach myself to program, I started with Java. And although Im familiar with writing simple procedural software mostly in PHP, Ive recently come to realize that for more complex operations I emrelyem on objects.p  pMy first Java game spawned opponents at random locations and with random speeds by instantiating objects.

So Im wondering if stuff like this is possible with a totally non objectoriented mindset. Theres no real substitute for instantiation, is there Its all just allocation of memory, so the way I see it, certain C programs have no choice but to be written using some form of what I consider objects.p  pPlease tell me Im overlooking something, because otherwise I cant respect C purists who berate the objectoriented paradigm.

Negative 7979 pI know this may have been asked a zillion times before but I cannot seem to find the golden solution for my exact use case.p  pI only have one data structure, a map where the key is a string. The objects of the map are maps themselves but this time the values are simple objectsprimitives such as string, int, double, etc. So a map of maps. The keys of the innermost map is constant, i.e. no entries are ever addedremoved from the innermost map except when created. So it is kind of like a traditional table, albeit each row may have arbitrary columns.p  pI need this data structure to be persistent and replicated.p  pHere are my requirementsp  ol liPure Java solution li liThe disk map is only used in case of restart. Hence there are never any reads from disk and all the writing is only done by one applicationli liEmbedded.li liPerformance. It is the UPDATE performance of existing records that is important. UPDATEs will happen potentially 100k times per second but more likely 2050k per second. As for INSERTsDELETEs they do of course happen but probably only a few times per day. Hence I do not worry too much about INSERTDELETE performance. li liReplicated. For resilience I need the disk copy of the map to be replicated. The replication from master to slave does not need to be part of the original transaction, i.e. I can sacrifice some ACIDness for performance.li liNumber of records is expected to be 100k200k, but not much higher. The size of each record is probably 100200 KBytes so really not that much data in total. Im guessing the total size of the data file will be below 100 MBytes and that is probably an estimate on the high side.li liThe total amount of data is not more than it can always fit in memory. this is why I can guarantee that there will be no disk reads, except during startupli liMy application is not distributed. At any given point in time theres only one active process that writes to disk.li liLiberal open source license. Apache, BSD, LGPL, should be fineli ol  pThe application in question never needs to store anything but the above data structure, i.e. it will not have a future uncovered need for other persistent data structures. Hence it sounds fair to optimize based on this particular data structure.p  pIve looked at Berkeley DB Java edition but it fails on requirement 6.

Negative 7979 pWithin Xcode if I set the code signing identity to some profile, lets call it A, then check the  project file into source control SVN.  Then if I check the project out onto another machine then I am finding that the profile that is set within XCode has changed from A to B. So it seems Xcode itself is picking which profile is being used and not what I set it to when the source code was checked in. I have to go and manually change it to what it should be.p  pThis happens if I set the profile on machine X then check it out on machine Y, or vice versa.p  pIs XCode storing the profiles used in some local file which doesnt get automatically shared as opposed to a global file like schemes, where you have to explicitly share them. p  pWhy is XCode not using the profile that was set when the project was checked into source controlp  pIve not encountered this problem before, Ive also updated to the latest Xcode, I dont know if that is related or just coincidental.p

Negative 7979 pAs explained in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq6109745631802another questiona, Ngen is usually only allowed to inline methods across assemblies if the method has the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.runtime.targetedpatchingoptoutattribute28vvs.10029.aspxTargetedPatchingOptOutAttributea set.p  pBut is this also true for a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary6t9t5wcf28vvs.10029.aspxhard bounda assemblies by using the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.runtime.compilerservices.dependencyattribute28vvs.10029.aspxDependencyAttributea with codeLoadHint.Alwayscodep  pstrongeditstrong Maybe the answer to my initial question is no, otherwise it would make no sense that the codeTargetedPatchingOptOutAttributecode is used in mscorlib since this assembly is always hard bound it has the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.runtime.compilerservices.defaultdependencyattribute28vvs.10029.aspxDefaultDependencyAttributea set.

Negative 7979 pI have a control toolbar app that needs to float on top of everything else on the primary screen of a dual monitor system. It positions itself at the top of the primary screen and sets TopMosttrue.p  pThis control toolbar can be used to launch two other processes which run fullscreen but NOT TopMost, one on each monitor on the dual monitor system. These windows are setup to run fullscreen by setting BorderStyle to None and setting the bounds of the window to fit exactly into the screen dimensions. The fullscreen windows have no problem covering the taskbar, and I can focus and interact with the fullscreen window on the primary monitor all day and the toolbar stays on top.p  pAll is not peachy in the kingdom of software however  certain actions make the TopMost toolbar pop under the nonTopMost fullscreen windows. One of those actions is giving focus to the fullscreen app on the secondary monitor, then giving focus back to the fullscreen app on the primary monitor. This is the easiest situation to reproduce as it happens every time I follow this sequence. I have a hard time reproducing other scenarios reliably, but if I hit the windows key to pull up the start menu and start browsing in Internet Explorer, emsometimesem when I am done browsing and close IE and give focus back to the primary monitor fullscreen app it pops over the TopMost window.p  pAny idea how to keep the TopMost window on top, and not allow it to pop under a nonTopMost fullscreen window I wouldnt mind doing something like polling WindowFromPoint once a second to see if the toolbar is still on top and if not then pop it back over somehow, but I dont want to take focus away from the fullscreen app if thats what the user is using, so Activate isnt a particularly good solution.p  pI dont think this really matters, but the toolbar is a WPF window and the fullscreen apps are WinForms.p  pUPDATEp  pThe easiest way to test this is to press F11 to go fullscreen in two browser windows on each monitor to simulate the full screen apps and then have a TopMost window floating anywhere. Click between the two fullscreen windows and you will see the TopMost window pop under them. I opened IE on one monitor and Chrome on another since IE doesnt let me do two fullscreen windows.p  pI implemented the Activate hack for now, but its a rather ugly solution because it activates the toolbar app which unfocuses the fullscreen app, which in turn makes the taskbar pop over the fullscreen app. Kind of hacky when all you want to do is switch which fullscreen app has focus.p

Negative 7979 pI have been exploring the use of a hrefhttpsgithub.comslodgeMvvmCrossMVVM Crossa on Xamarin Studio on a Mac.  Ive been going through the tutorials for a hrefhttpwww.youtube.complaylistlistPLR6WI6W1JdeYSXLbm58jwAKYT7RQR31WN1 days of MvvmCrossa on YouTube and Ive run into a roadblock that hopefully someone else has experienced.p  pThe tutorials use PCLs and VS 2012, but since Im on a Mac, I have to use Xamarin Studio.  I understand PCLs are not support in Xamarin Studio so Ive created a base C project and then linked the libraries to a Xamarin.Android project. Ive read quite a few MvvmCross posts including a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15613790setupofxamarinstudiotoworkwithpclmvvmcrossthis onea but havent been able to find a solution.p  pThe project builds successfully and appears to deploy to the emulator successfully, but I can not get the app to run on the emulator.  The app immediately closes and the only error I receive is the following nondescript message in the Application Output of Xamarin Studio.p  precode[monodroidgc] GREF GC Threshold 1800 [mono] Stacktrace [mono]  [mono]  [mono] Unhandled Exception [mono] System.NullReferenceException Object reference not set to an instance of an object [mono] [ERROR] FATAL UNHANDLED EXCEPTION System.NullReferenceException Object reference not set to an instance of an object codepre  pIve set multiple breakpoints but cannot get any them to fire, it appears the error is occurring before my code is run.

Ive confirmed that all of the DLLs are correct. Im using the precompiled libraries from a hrefhttpsgithub.comslodgeMvvmCrossBinarieshttpsgithub.comslodgeMvvmCrossBinariesa.p  pIm really not sure where to go next to determine the cause of this error.  Has anyone else experienced this  I know both Xamarin and MvvmCross focus on Visual Studio integration and PC development is MvvmCross stable enough to use on Xamarin Studio for a Mac  Does anyone know what my error may be, or what to try nextp  pI know this is a fairly undefined problem but Im hoping Im not the only one to experience this. Ive tried to be a descriptive as possible but if anyone need more information, please let me know.  Thanks.p

Negative 7979 pI am following the quaternion tutorial a hrefhttpwww.raywenderlich.com12667howtorotatea3dobjectusingtoucheswithopengl relnofollowhttpwww.raywenderlich.com12667howtorotatea3dobjectusingtoucheswithopengla and am trying to rotate a globe to some XYZ location. I have an initial quaternion and generate a random XYZ location on the surface of the globe. I pass that XYZ location into the following function. The idea was to generate a lookAt vector with GLKMatrix4MakeLookAt and define the end Quaternion for the slerp step from the lookAt matrix.p  precode voidrotateToLocationXfloatx andYfloaty andZfloatz        Turn on the interpolation for smooth rotation     slerping  YES  Begin auto rotating to this location     slerpCur  0     slerpMax  1.0     slerpStart  quat       The eye location is defined by the look at location multiplied by this modifier     float modifier  1.0       Create a look at vector for which we will create a GLK4Matrix from     float xEye  x     float yEye  y     float zEye  z     NSLogf f f f f f,xEye, yEye, zEye, x, y, z     currentSatelliteLocation  GLKMatrix4MakeLookAtxEye, yEye, zEye, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0     currentSatelliteLocation  GLKMatrix4MultiplycurrentSatelliteLocation,self.effect.transform.modelviewMatrix       Turn our 4x4 matrix into a quat and use it to mark the end point of our interpolation     currentSatelliteLocation  GLKMatrix4TranslatecurrentSatelliteLocation, 0.0f, 0.0f, GLOBALEARTHZLOCATION     slerpEnd  GLKQuaternionMakeWithMatrix4currentSatelliteLocation       Print info on the quat     GLKVector3 vec  GLKQuaternionAxisslerpEnd     float angle  GLKQuaternionAngleslerpEnd     NSLogf f f f,vec.x,vec.y,vec.z,angle      NSLogQuat end     [self printMatrixcurrentSatelliteLocation]     [self printMatrixself.effect.transform.modelviewMatrix]   codepre  pThe interpolation works, I get a smooth rotation, however the ending location is never the XYZ  I input  I know this because my globe is a sphere and I am calculating XYZ from Lat Lon. I want to look directly down the lookAt vector toward the center of the earth from that latlon location on the surface of the globe after the rotation. I think it may have something to do with the up vector but Ive tried everything that made sense.p  pWhat am I doing wrong  How can I define a final quaternion that when I finish rotating, looks down a vector to the XYZ on the surface of the globe Thanksp

Negative 7979 pWe have the following WPF  a datagrid with row detail template. Selected line on this grid customer selection is handled to trigger two queries to retrieve address and contacts data, then row detail template show these data in two tabs, each with a datagrid. All the magic is done with binding, subgrids bind to properties of main Customer object, which we have as an IObservableCollection.p  pThe bug happens when using move down arrow on keyboard, selected index changes fast, so fast than queries result come back late to interface, thus data is incoherent to what is shown and data update cannot perform. We have an exception. So my question is  how to prevent this in a proper manner p  pShould we have a trycatch the right kind of obscure exception then do nothing loose data that cannot be applied to interface  We dont want to wait for data to come back, if user scrolls very quickly, customer selected line should go down and no matter details arent shown. Maybe we should have a delay before selected item details are retrieved  Thus no query if selected item changes before end of delay p  pThank you for your ideas.p  pGists for code Xaml  a hrefhttpsgist.github.comXarkam3b89eb614124bb2f2307 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comXarkam3b89eb614124bb2f2307a Selected index changed handling  a hrefhttpsgist.github.comXarkamcf28844ce05fd4984807 relnofollowhttpsgist.github.comXarkamcf28844ce05fd4984807ap  pstrongEdit 10th of July strong I have modified the main datagrid items definition as in following gist  add codehttpscode prefix, I dont have enough reputation to add more links, sorry gist.github.compostb99d3be79f0ef2544d685f9 inspired from stackoverflow.comquestions13374957datagridthrowsinvalidoperationexceptionbyscrolling and proposed answer but problem still persists... p

Negative 7979 pDoes holding a users password in a javascript variable in the browser expose any specific security vulnerabilities, over and above the usual security vulnerabilities of a browserbased clientp  pConsider this snippet as a simple example  a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netjS55Mjsfiddle hereap  precodeltlabel forpasswordgtPasswordltlabelgt ltinput typepassword idpasswordgtltbrgtltbrgt ltbutton typebutton idpwdButtongtStore password in window.passwordltbuttongt  ltscriptgt     function getContentsOfPasswordField          return jQueryinputpassword.val           jQuerybuttonpwdButton.onclick, function          window.password  getContentsOfPasswordField         alert  password   stored in global var window.password      ltscriptgt codepre  pIn this example the password variable is global and persists for the lifetime of the page, just to make it as opentoattack as possible and give the worstcase scenario. Perhaps limiting the scopelifetime of the variable can shield it from certain classes of attacksp  pThe attack that comes immediately to mind is XSS, but then if the client is vulnerable to XSS in the first place, the attacker can read the password by key logging anyway see a hrefhttpwww.symantec.comconnectblogsgettingsassyxsspart1keystrokeloggingthisa so holding it in a variable doesnt, as far as I can see, increase vulnerability to XSS attacks.p  pPlease note the point of the question is not really whether or not doing this is a bad practice, this is more of a fundamental question about clientside web app security p

Negative 7979 pI am still relatively new to Javascript, and have been trying to wrap my head around how a particular library is managing such clean types and naming convention.p  pThe library in question is emTeleriksem strongKendo UIstrong, and specifically I am curious how they are achieving something that reminds me of C namespaces. For instance... there is a type called an emObservableArrayem, which can be accessed through strongkendo.ui.ObservableArraystrong. p  pI dug into the source code and am really confused about what is going on. I have omitted a lot of the code for proprietary reasons, but the general closure shouldnt be an issue. I was wondering if someone could help me to grasp how they are achieving some of this...p  precodefunction , evil, undefined      var kendo  window.kendo  window.kendo   cultures  ,         extend  .extend,         each  .each  more code omitted      function Class        Class.extend  function proto           most of this code omitted         return subclass           more code omitted jQuery, eval  this line is really confusing me codepre  pParticularly, what has me lost beyond belief is that second line. Where they are declaring a variable emkendoem equal to a variable defined on emwindowem. I have searched high and low for hours and hours and cannot for the life of me figure out where this is first happening. I have been unable to reproduce the same behavior in my own code.p  pI have figured out that the strongextendstrong function serves as a way to pair up an object with an existing object, and selectively attach it like an accessible member. But that strongwindow.kendostrong thing, it is driving me crazy. p

Negative 7979 pThis is how I learned on the job to create a class, create a database access object with a readRecord method in order to get information from the database.  What Im curious about, is what the SF communitys recommendations would be for shortening it  I could get rid of a few lines of code by moving the readRecord code up into the DAO method and just changing it up in there, but that still presents the problem of having possibly hundreds of lines of codes...just for properties in a class, and for getting the values for those properties in the DAO.  p  pI understand that theres nothing really to do in the class I mean, you cant just autogenerate a bunch of properties...Visual Studio doesnt know what Im going to make, but for the DAO, is there a way to loop through all properties in the class, determine their types, and then get the information  I abhor typing hundreds of property  dr.GetVariableTypevariablename over and over againp  pSorry

Negative 7979 pSo Im a bit confused about how the DirectoryIterator works.p  pLets say I have a directory with 100000 files. Using the readdir function I could easily walk through the entire file list without any performance hits, because the function gets me one file at the time.p  pDoes the DirectoryIterator work in the same way, or does it read the entire directory when you construct the object, and stores it into some internal array like scandir for example p  pNormally it shouldnt do that because its an iterator and has next method etc, but it seems pretty slow compared to readdir so I thought I should ask to make sure.p

Negative 7979 pIn the spare time Im starting writing a very simple C emulator for the 6502 CPU. I used to write down a lot of assembly code for this CPU so all the opcodes, addressing modes and other stuff are not a big deal.p  pThe 6502 has 56 different instructions plus 13 addressing modes giving a total of 151 different opcodes. To me speed is not an issue so instead of writing a huge switchcase statement and repeat the same code again and again different opcodes can refer to the same instruction using a different addressing mode Id like to separate actual instruction code from the addressing mode code I found this solution very neat as it would require to write only 13 addressing mode functions and 56 instruction functions without repeat myself.p  phere the addressing mode functionsp  precode Addressing modes uint16t AddrACC  ACCUMULATOR uint16t AddrIMM  IMMEDIATE uint16t AddrABS  ABSOLUTE uint16t AddrZER  ZERO PAGE uint16t AddrZEX  INDEXEDX ZERO PAGE uint16t AddrZEY  INDEXEDY ZERO PAGE uint16t AddrABX  INDEXEDX ABSOLUTE uint16t AddrABY  INDEXEDY ABSOLUTE uint16t AddrIMP  IMPLIED uint16t AddrREL  RELATIVE uint16t AddrINX  INDEXEDX INDIRECT uint16t AddrINY  INDEXEDY INDIRECT uint16t AddrABI  ABSOLUTE INDIRECT codepre  pthey all returns the actual memory address 16 bit used by the instruction to readwrite the operandresultp  pthe instruction function prototype isp  precodevoid OpADCuint16t addr void OpANDuint16t addr void OpASLuint16t addr     ... codepre  pit takes the 16 bit address, perform its own operations, update the status flags andor registers, and commit the results if any on the same memory address.p  pGiven that code framework I found difficult to use the ACCUMULATOR addressing mode which is the only one to return the actual value of the A internal register instead of a memory address.

Negative 7979 pI have 2 sqlite3.x databases from an iPhone, one from a game app, and the other is the address book.p  pI have logging and display errors on in the php conf.p  pUsing PHPPDO I can display the fields and values from the game database, including image blobs which I catch with my results page and render with img srcdata....  Im using htmlentities on other fields to catch things like plist binary blobs.p  pIm using a perl script to generate the first page, and the sample data is obtained using a system call to sqlite3.  The script is doing a recursive search through a directory provided as a cli argument.p  pI basically get the first record from each table within a database as a data sample, give the user options on which fields they want to further interrogate, and pass those options to a form handler which executes the query against the target table, and getting data from the chosen columns.p  pHowever...I get a unable to open database general error when trying to connect to the addressbook database.p  pI have checked the database permissions, ownership, put both in the same directory, made them fully open to the world..everything I can think of, and still no joy.p  pWhats really odd is that I can query all databases quite happily from the commandline with sqlite3, but get this error when using PDO.p  pThe whole things trips up at the followingp  precodedb and strSQL vals passed from previous page  dbh  new PDOsqlite.db dbhgtsetAttributePDOATTRERRMODE, PDOERRMODEWARNING result  dbhgtquerystrSQL codepre  pEven if I select a simple primary key column from the table, I get the error, so Im pretty sure its not a data handling problem.

Negative 7979 pIm looking for some guidelinestips on how to implement Apache Shiro as a part of a distributed system clientserver using Java RMI.p  pIve looked at the answer to this thread  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13632442howtoorganizermiclientserverarchitectureHow to organize RMI ClientServer architecturea and Im thinking of using something similar. What I have planned is a remote object possibly a Singleton that handles the authentication when the client log in. If the log in is successful a new sessionobject is created. But Im not quite sure where this object would belong and what information to store in it. Should it be passed on to the client or exists as another remote object. p  pIm thinking that it should be used as some kind of session facade where each request from the client is being authorized by Shiro.  Im not sure whether it is best and possible to give the client a unique tokenidentifier that Shiro knows about and can authorized based on for each methodinvocation, or to create a remote sessionfacade object that exists for each connection and stores the information about the current user and so forth.p  pAlso I dont know quite how Shiro handles the Subject when used in multithreaded application and whether either of the mentioned proposals would cause a conflict. p  pIm looking forward to hear your thoughts on this  Thanksp

Negative 7979 pOkay, after a solid day Ive solved my problem but think this MUST be a bug.  I started in grails 2.3.2 and upgraded to 2.3.4, all the samep  pMy grails app is divided up into plugin a base plugin that has core domain objects and some interfaces, N factory plugins that require the base plugin and one app, that can include any number of the factory plugins.  All of these plugins, for now, are local not in any external maven repop  pSo this is what people are calling the transitive plugin issue.  What Im seeing is that I write the base plugin and use maven install to put it into my local repo the .m2repository....  Fine.  Then I write one of the factory plugins where in the BuildConfig under the plugins section I put the base plugin.  It compiles and packages fine, but when I run maveninstall it saysp  blockquote   p Error Could not find artifact pkgblahnameblahjarverblah in   grailsCentral a hrefhttprepo.grails.orggrailsplugins relnofollowhttprepo.grails.orggrailspluginsa scope compile   Use stacktrace to see the full tracep blockquote  pNow, beyond the s theres something I didnt see for about 6 hours.  The strongemjaremstrong. See it there  I didnt for a LONG time.  A very LONG, frustrating time. Why is it looking for jar when its been put into the plugins section of the BuildConfig  That, to my understanding, is only when its in the dependencies section.p  pI think thats the bug.  Let me know how wrong I may or may not be.  Dunno.  Im no Grails God, just an everyday user.p  pOh, the fix  use grails createpom, put pom true into the BuildConfig, then edit the pom and under the dependencies section of the pom for the plugins, add in codelttypegtziplttypegtcode. Oh, default packaging at the top of the pom is grailsplugin or something.  Change it to zip.  Then all is fine.p  pJust dunno why its defaulting to jar for a plugin.  Edify mep

Negative 7979 pIs it possible have some parts of RShiny app execute in a delayed fashion much like the Delayed start in Windows Services p  pLet me elaborate.p  pI have a shiny app with tabs. Each tab have a bunch of radio buttons on the sidebarPanel. Clicking on each radio button brings up a report. My set up is as simple as this. p  pHowever when I load the app every time and when the first tab is auto rendered, all reports associated with all radio buttons under this tab is executed and then the first radio button is selected and its correlating report is displayed. This whole process takes about 1011 seconds which I want to bring down.p  pDuring server start, I simply read my myData.RData file in global.R. So all data is prefetched and I am assuming kept in memory during server start. What happens when the tab is brought to focus is that the data.frames from myData.RData are read and a series of ggplots renderPlot and tables renderText are called.p  pIs there a way I can render the first report within few seconds and then proceed to executing other ggplots and tables I did go thru reactivity conductors and isolations but couldnt figure what solution fits my problem here.p  pOr is there any other way I can speeden the load and refresh timep  pSome code to help understand the issue..p  precode     In server.R      libraryshiny     libraryplyr     libraryggplot2     librarygrid      sourcea.R, localTRUE     sourceb.R, localTRUE      shinyServerfunctioninput, output          The below two lines represent a report pair to me.

Negative 7979 pThere is a project I am working on in which a set of targets appear onto the screen. The targets should appear a certain amount at the same time, and with a certain delay in between each appearance. My question is how I would correctly store the level data for this game. I was considering using a csv file to store the level data target type, location, delay, etc., but Im wondering if there is a better way to do it. I had also considered making a level object to store level information, but Im not sure. Apple says to use Archives of sprite nodes, but I cant seem to find out what that means. Any thoughts p
Negative 7979 pemNote, an SSH API wont work because its for a MUD client, and not many MUDs support SSH, they still use telnet.

However, that was using Apache a hrefhttpcommons.apache.orgpropercommonsnetapidocsorgapachecommonsnettelnetTelnetClient.html relnofollowTelnetClienta which comes with its own set of pros and cons, whereas this is with just plain sockets.p  pAlso, Im trying to take advantage of the codetry with resourcescode statement for a hrefhttpwww.oracle.comtechnetworkjavasocket140484.htmlmulti relnofollowmultithreaded socket communicationa.

Negative 7979 pWe have a .NET exe .NET 3.5, VS 2010 SP1, VB.NET project that is COM visible. A VB6 application uses CreateObject to create an object from this assembly.br This works without any problem if we do not sign the assembly. If we sign the assembly with a pfxcertificate, CreateObject fails with the message p  blockquote   pCant create Object Our.ClassNamep blockquote  pUnfortunately, there is no entry in the event log. The .NET exe can be started without any problem so all dependencies should be in place. Weve also enabled .NET binding logging, but it does not write anything when CreateObject is called so we suspect that the creation fails before the assembly is loaded.  br Weve tracked down all changes, the only difference that matters is whether the assembly is signed or not. Also weve tried different certificates, but the behavior doesnt change. brbr Has anyone experienced this behavior before and can provide a solution Are there any ways that can give us more information about the failurep

Negative 7979 pAs the documentation for mudcube MIDI.js seems to be lacking in this regard, Im hoping there is someone who might be able to point me in the right direction. To put it plainly, using midi.js, how do you adjust the duration and ending of midi notesp  pFor some background, Ive created a music staff widget with draggable and droppable notes jQueryui, that can be added or removed, to form sequences which can be called upon to playback midi. Everything works thus far as it should, however, as Im trying to expand the functionality of this widget with more intricate timing, Ive run into some issues. p  pIt seems that I can only play the notes at a set duration and, for all my efforts, havent been able to implement changes that could vary this duration to say, half notes, quarter notes, eight notes, etc. Also, and this may be one of the causes, MIDI.noteOff has no perceivable effect on the output. One would think that a given note would play indefinitely until MIDI.noteOff is called, however, said note will play and then trail off regardless of whether noteOff is called. p  pLet me say here that I have done extensive research on SO and the web in general to get to the bottom of this. I have found people with similar problems and applied their fixes but their answers do not work for me. See a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14301785howdoiplayarbitrarymidinoteswithjavascripthow do I play arbitrary notes in Midi with javascripta and a hrefhttpsgithub.commudcubeMIDI.jsissues11 relnofollowMIDI.noteOff does not seem to work reliablyap  pI have a sequence of notes called noteSequence where each note is an object with noteValue i.e. C4 and noteDuration properties that are converted into a midiSequence in the function convertToMidiSequence. Everything works well with melodic sequences and chords, I just want to have the duration functionality added. I should also say that adjusting the delay variable or the noteDuration property only adds to the time before the sequence is played. Then after the initial delay, the sequence plays with the same timing as before.p  pThank you for taking some time to look this over and hopefully help out. It would be very much appreciated. p  pHere is the applicable code that runs my MIDIp  precodedocument.readyfunction    MIDI.loadPlugin     soundfontUrl GLOBALS.SOUNDFONTURL,     instrument acousticgrandpiano,     callback function        var channel  0,           instrument  0,           velocity  127,           delay  1       MIDI.programChange0, instrument           function playCurrentSequence    playSequencenoteSequence   function playSequencesequence    var midiSequence  convertToMidiSequencesequence   for var i  0 i lt midiSequence.length i      if midiSequence[i] instanceof Array        playNotemidiSequence[i], i          else        playChordmidiSequence[i], i           function playNotemidiNote, notePositionInMeasure    var channel  0,       velocity  127,       delay  1   MIDI.noteOnchannel, midiNote, velocity, delay  notePositionInMeasure  1   MIDI.noteOffchannel, midiNote,     delay  midiNote.noteDuration  notePositionInMeasure  1   MIDI.Player.stop   function playChordmidiChord, notePositionInMeasure    var channel  0,       velocity  127,       delay  1   for var i  0 i lt midiChord.length i      MIDI.noteOnchannel, midiChord[i], velocity, delay  notePositionInMeasure  1     MIDI.noteOffchannel, midiChord[i],       delay  midiChord[i].noteDuration  notePositionInMeasure  1     MIDI.Player.stop     codepre

Negative 7979 pI have been trying to change my wordpress theme to be 860px wide instead of 1200px.  I have gotten all of the content to be 860px and the headerfooter and it all looks great.  Even the codelthtmlgtcode tag says that its 860px when I view it in firebug.p  pHowever, there is still CSS code in my codeltheadgtcode tag that I dont know where its coming from and it puts in codehtml  minwidth 1200px code.  This causes my site to load as 1200px wide on mobile with the content only 860px wide.  So there is blank space to the right of all of my content.  I just want it 860px, not centered or anything else.  Any advice would help, thank you allp

Negative 7979 pSo, I got a new job and it requires a lot of VM management and editing php files on these VMs. Anyway we use putty to log into the VMs and just linux commands to edit the files. I figure there has to be an easier way out there. Not that I cant handle linux commands, but editing documents becomes much more cumbersome this way. I heard there is a way to do this through eclipse, but I dont know it.  I do not ever have the php files on my computer, so wamp wouldnt work to my knowledge. thanks in advance for the help.p

Negative 7979 pI have page with two tables. I need to make some actions with both tables, triggered outside some functions in view controller.p  pSo, both tables has same methods and variables and I should reload or search both tables with button and input in view controller. This is it.p  pWhat I want is to separate tables  I dont want to call reloadTable1 and reloadTable2, and use  table1Data and table2Data in scope to render it.p  pstrongFirst ideastrong was to create service for each table. But the problem was data rendering, when I use just variable to render it. Here is example a hrefhttpplnkr.coeditbzgvtFzRWUDad1CR4mZVppreview relnofollowhttpplnkr.coeditbzgvtFzRWUDad1CR4mZVppreviewa . strongNot really related, but question why it doesnt work I know workaround  use accessors, but I dont really want to create function per variablestrong I want to use same class for 2 services, but with difference  one argument.p  pstrongSecond ideastrong to use 3 controllers parent and 1 per each table, reload tables with scope.broadcast. But I dont really like this idea strongit uses eventsstrongI dont think it is good idea to use it in this case and it will use additional controllers. Also, I think, it is good idea to use service here.p  pAny advicesp

Negative 7979 pSETUPp  pMASTER DEVICE Raspberry Pi Model B REV2p  pSLAVE DEVICE Arduino Uno REV3p  pPROBLEMp  pWhenever I enter r into the command line it returns a number that is completely off what it should be. For example, when I hook my jumper wire to the analog pin A0 up to 5V and press r on the command line it should return 5 volts. Well it returned 255. When I had the jumber wire hooked up to the 3.3V pin it returned 169.p  pNOTEp  pThe person who wrote this code did note something that I thought might be related to this issue. His words were as follows.....p  pThe setup function in the Arduino then sets up two callback functions thatwill be used. The function processMessage will be invoked whenever the on Receive event occurs. This will be whenever a command is sent from the Raspberry Pi. The other callback function, sendAnalogReading, is associated with the onRequest event. This occurs when the Raspberry Pi requests data and will read the analog value divide it by four to make it fit into a single byte, and then send it back to the Raspberry Pi.p  pI have no idea what he means by dividing the value to make it fit into a single byte. Is this why im getting weird numbers back Can someone explain this. p  pJust to make this thread more clear here is my setup and the output that is being displayed from issuing multiple commands. p  psudo python ardupii2c.py ran my programp  pFirst scenario, I hooked the jumper wire from pin A0 to GRD on the arduino. Then I chose the r option and it gave me 0  p  pSecond scenario I hooked the jumper wire from pin A0 to 5V on the arduino. Then I choose r and it gave me 255p  pThird scenario I hooked the jumper wire from pin A0 to 3.3V. It gave me 171. p  pFourth scenario I hooked the jumper wire from pin A0 to the negative side of the LED and it gave me 0p  pFifth scenario I hooked the jumper wire from pin A0 to the positive side of the LED and it gave me 105. p  pSince the first and fourth scenarios seem to work alight im curious why the other numbers where way off and if they have some actual meaning to them. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comG6jSP.jpg altenter image description herep  pPSUEDO CODEp  precodeCreates instance of SMBus called bus Prompts user for command l toggles led or r reads from Analog pin 0 if command is l it writes it to arduino and causes onReceive handlerprocessmessage if command is r then requestreading function will be called this will call readbyte in SMBus library that causes the on Request event to be     invoked.  codepre  pPYTHON PROGRAMp  precodeimport smbus import time bus  smbus.SMBus1 SLAVEADDRESS  0x04 def requestreading     reading  intbus.readbyteSLAVEADDRESS     printreading while True     command  rawinputEnter command l  toggle LED, r  read A0      if command  l          bus.writebyteSLAVEADDRESS, ordl     elif command  r          requestreading codepre  pARDUINO PROGRAMp  precodeinclude ltWire.hgt int SLAVEADDRESS  0x04 int ledPin  13 int analogPin  A0 boolean ledOn  false void setup       pinModeledPin, OUTPUT     Wire.beginSLAVEADDRESS     Wire.onReceiveprocessMessage     Wire.onRequestsendAnalogReading     Serial.begin9600  void loop   void processMessageint n   Serial.printlnIn processMessage   char ch  Wire.read     if ch  l        toggleLED void toggleLED   ledOn   ledOn   digitalWriteledPin, ledOn void sendAnalogReading   Serial.printlnIn sendAnalogReading   int reading  analogReadanalogPin   Wire.writereading gtgt 2 codepre

Eventually I stripped the program down to its basicsp  pStep 1 Create an array of URL objects.p  pStep 2 Loop through the array and openclose a buffered reader to read each line.p  pStep 3 Read the entire page and move onto the next line.  p  pEven this slowed down in the exact spot, so this isnt a problem with the data I am parsing or where I am storing it.  It is a result of this loop somehow.  I am wondering if there is a memory issue with what I have written that is causing issues  Otherwise my only guess is somehow I am making calls too quickly to the website servers and it is intentionally slowing me down.  p  pObviously not the best written code, as I am new and subject to a bunch of sloppy coding.  But it does execute perfectly what I want.  The issue is it slows down to a crawl after about ten minutes, which wont work.  p  pHere is the relevant codep  pstrongArray codestrongp  precodeimport java.io.IOException import java.net.URL  public class UrlArrayBuild   private int pagecount number of pages  public URL[] urlArray  array of webpage urls      public UrlArrayBuildint page  object constructor         pagecount  page initializes pagecount         urlArray  new URL[pagecount] initializes pagecount           protected void buildArray throws IOException   method assigns strings to   UrlArray object         int count counter for iteration         forint i  0 i lt pagecount i  loops through              count  i  60 sets user number at end of page             URL website  new URLhttp....  count             urlArray[i]  website url address             System.out.printlnurlArray[i] debug                    protected URL returnArrayValueint index   method returns string value in array of given index         System.out.printlnurlArray[index] debug         return urlArray[index]           protected int returnArrayLength  method returns length of array         System.out.printlnurlArray.length debug         return urlArray.length         codepre  pstrongReader Codestrong  p  precodeimport java.net. import java.io.  public class DataReader   public static void mainString[] args throws IOException      UrlArrayBuild PrimaryArray  new UrlArrayBuild9642 Creates array object     PrimaryArray.buildArray  Builds array       Create and initialize variables to use in loop     URL website  null       String inputLine  null              Loops through array and reads source code     for int i  0 i lt PrimaryArray.returnArrayLength i           try              website  PrimaryArray.returnArrayValuei  acquires url             BufferedReader inputStream  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReaderwebsite.openStream  reads url source code             System.out.printlnPrimaryArray.returnArrayValuei  prints out website url.

That leads me to believe that HTTP Message Handlers, in general, only execute as part of a Web API pipeline.p  pAlso, a hrefhttpwww.asp.netwebapioverviewworkingwithhttphttpmessagehandlersHttp Message Handlers run before Url Routinga, so it probably isnt URL routing that chooses between the Web API and MVC pipeline.p  blockquote   p...consider using an action filter instead of a message handler [because a]ction filters   run after URI routing is performed.p blockquote  pstrongQuestionstrongp  ul liAre codeHttpMessageHandlerscode a part of ASP.NET Web API but not of ASP.NET MVCli liWhat is the codeHttpMessageHandlercode equivalent in MVC strongEQUIVALENTstrong in the diagramli liWhat causes the request to follow the Web API pipeline strongFORKstrong in the diagramli liAre Web API requests fundamentally different that MVC requestsli ul  pMy sense is that it goes something like this, but please correct me.p  precode               Request from Client                                               IIS                                                                        ASP.NET                                     HttpApplication.BeginRequest                                            et cetera                                  HttpApplication.MapRequestHandler  is this what does the routing                                              FORK                                                                                                                                                                                      Web API           MVC                                    HttpControllerRouteHandler   MvcRouteHandler                                       HttpControllerHandler                                                    HttpMessageHandlers       EQUIVALENT             i.e.                       DelegatingHandlers                         incl.

Negative 7979 pWe are looking into coded UI, and since we have C coding experience well be coding up the automated tests ourselves. p  pI already know that it is possible to have a test case with defined test steps. Each test step is actually a function inside the test method and the description comes from the summary. p  pThis is a great way for the c coders to expose what theyre doing to the non coding testers who will interact with these automated tests using MTM Microsoft test manager. p  pHowever, it would be awesome if the C coders were able to create generic functions as Shared Steps perhaps, and in this way non technical testers were able to assemble new tests in MTM using these building blocks. p  pFunctions such as  Open the settings dialog, Maximize Window, Add an item with parameters, Close all open tabs, etc. p  pHowever these would be coded functions, not from a recording. p  pThe idea would be that once these functions are created and stored in TFS Again as shared steps, the tester would then be able to use these functions as building blocks for more automated tests. p  pI also have to stress that these functions will be fully automated, and so new tests assembled in MTM too need to be fully automated without needing to open up Visual Studio. p  pIs this at all possiblep

Negative 7979 pI need to understand and maybe ideas about single page apps.p  pI want to create a project, ill do it with MVC. I also want to use AngularJS for client side programming. p  pI know that AngularJS is good for single page applications and when working with SPAs you send your data to API to process. But data sent from Angular is visible to user and open to be manipulated. p  pI dont want users to be able to see any data or access to the API from the internet. Witch way i should follow p  pIm thinking about keeping sensitive user data in MVC controller. For example lets say user Id is very sensitive for my project. If i keep user id in javascript variable, when im sending it to API with some command user will able to change the id and manipulate the system. But if i keep userid in MVC controller, via user authentication, and send request to my MVC controller then the user wont be able to change it.  But i know this is not the best way of doing things, there must be a more clever way. p  pIll be glad if someone can explain how this things works in SPAs or when you use Angular and MVC together.p

Negative 7979 pI new to using web applications. I am currently using visual studio 2013 and I have created a web application. I would like to have a form that employees fill out and then when they hit submit the form will either add, change or delete from the database. From researching I originally tried making a web form. This did not allow me to keep the formatting that was made on my master page, and when I tried connecting it to the master page it did not allow it because of the codeltformgtcode. So then I created a web form with master page. This allows me to keep the formatting from the master page but now I am unable to create a form using codeltformgtcode.

Negative 7979 pI have a Grails application running with a very heavy backend data.Every selection made in the view of the application loads a new JSON file.I am new to developing web applications and I assume that this JSON file which is getting loaded is being loaded into the browsers cache memoryIts just a guess and I could be wrong too.Do correct me in that case.p  pWhy I came to this conclusion is because, after playing around with the application for some time and making different selections in the view, I observed that the browser crashesIn my case, it stops responding after the cumulative size of the JSON files loaded into the cache memoryassuming it to be cache memory exceeds 200MB.p  pIf the location where the files are being loaded is actually the cache memoryor be it any other storage location,I would like to delete the files loaded previously once a new selection is made.p  pIf this solution is not practical enough then, feel free to suggest any method that will solve my problem. Any help or suggestion will be appreciated.p

For a same type codeTcode, there must be one and only one codeSimpleMessengercode instance wich has to be codeContainerControlledLifetimeManagedcode without possible exception.p  pI use RegisterTypes to automaticaly do most of my registerations  p  precodeunityContainer.RegisterTypes             AllClasses.FromAssembliesInBasePath,             WithMappings.FromAllInterfacesInSameAssembly,             WithName.Default,             WithLifetime.None,             null,             true              codepre  pAnd to my great surprise, it appears that the container manage to automatically register all my SimpleMessengers  While unexpected, its potentially a good news. That is, if I manage to conventionally set the lifetime to codeContainerControlledLifetimeManagementcode for all my IMessagePublisher realizations.p  pIn a few words, I would like to add to my container a Registeration strategy which would say something likep  precodeifsomehowObtainedTypeToRegister.GetGenericTypeDefinition  typeofIMessageListenerltobjectgt.GetGenericTypeDefinition       Set one way or another the ContainerControlledLifetimeManagement for this type  codepre  pBut I have no idea how to do this. I already use a codeUnityContainerExtensioncode but it seems to be useful only at Reslution time, not at Registeration time. Is it some way to achieve that p
Negative 7979 pThe current best solutionp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma218888301786820httpstackoverflow.coma218888301786820ap  pI am trying to do one better, by opening the Instagram app with a preselected video file from the PhotoRoll, and a preloaded caption. In the Flipagram app, they do just this. When you hit share on a video, they save it your camera roll, suggest a caption, then direct to the Instagram app photo selection screen, with the video preselected. Even if the video is not the latest media in the PhotoRoll, it correctly highlights the correct video, along the caption prepared in the Flipagram app. p  pIs this possibly an undocumented iPhone hookp  pAny help is appreciated. p

However, the userstudent is to determine, by clicking on a button, when an item is displayed.  Two such buttons are included in this example.p  pAll elements were drawn with visibilityhidden when you entered the page. When the student clicks a button I use JavaScript to set visibilityvisible for the desired item.  They are displayed.  However they are drawn much too fast.  Click the Sketch the parabola button and compare the speed to the speed when the blue parabola was drawn.p  pHow can I slow down the displaying so that it looks like someone is drawing the itemp  pOr is there a way to delay execution of the SVG path statement until the student clicks the button If this is possible then I can use visibility visible and everything performs as desired.p  pDel p

Negative 7979 pIm having some trouble in Matlab, and this might be more of a methodologylogic question.p  pSo I have three netCDF files that I am loading into three separate  matrices. Two of these matrices are values of a test run for two different experiments all three files are gridded, and the other is the pvalue of the data between the two experiments. p  pI want to create a new netCDF file that has the values of the difference between the two experiments if that particular grid has a pvalue lt 0.05. p  pI thought this would be fairly easy. Here is what I implementedp  precodefind the difference between experiments, averaged over the 3rd dimension yrdiff  meanmat2012mat1980,3 yrdiffpvalue gt 0.05  NaN finalgrid  yrdiff codepre  pAnd then I used a fairly straight forward netCDF exporting scheme. To my knowledge, the mat2012 and mat1980 matrices are organized in the same as the pvalue matrix. p  pThis produces a sort of weird grid that doesnt really show anything. The first image below shows filled contours of the differences, with black contour lines where the areas are significant. The second plot shows filled contours of the netCDF file created with this logic, with the same significant contour lines. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com4ELIE.png altfull difference img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDhGaL.png altincorrect netCDFp  pSo my question Is the logic incorrect, and should I take a new direction Is this something related to my exporting scheme Or is this something else completely p

Negative 7979 pIn WordPress I have a custom post type books and two custom taxonomies genre and series. While all books have a genre, not all are part of a series. I want now to be able to query all nonseries titles, i.e. all books wo the series taxonomy. I hit the WordPress forums next and also googled for a solution, but only found how to exclude specific terms of a custom taxonomy but not the custom taxonomy itself and all terms that belong to it. p  pOf course, I could simply list all terms from series in my tax query to exclude them, but if I add new terms for series in the future, I have to remember to edit my query and I like to avoid it. Thats why I came up with the following idea but its not workingp  precodeltphp terms  getterms series, args  count  count terms  i  0 foreach  terms as term       i     termlist .  . termgtslug .      if  count  i           termlist . ,           else          termlist .        args  array     posttype gt books,     order gt ASC,     orderby gt date,     postsperpage gt 1,     taxquery        gt array     array         taxonomy  gt series,         terms gt arraytermlist,         field gt slug,         operator  gt NOT IN         ,  querypostsargsgt codepre  pAs you can see I tried to query first all terms for series and output them into a list in the style it would have to go into the tax array. The result I currently get is that all books appear when the query runs.p  pCan someone tell me where I went wrong Or if you have another approach to exclude all terms of a custom taxonomy wo manually tweaking the code every time a new term is added, Im all ears.p

Negative 7979 pI recently added an iOS 8 Photos Extension to my existing iOS 7compatible app. The extension shares some icons and other images with the main app. Since I cant use embedded frameworks yet to share those assets not available in iOS 7 I have those assets added to both targetsthe main app and the extension bundled within the app. So I expected an increase of the apps size by roughly factor two.p  pBut heres the catch the app is now roughly three times as large I tried to figure why and found that the compiled assets in the extension bundle are more then twice the size 38.6 MB compared to the assets in the main app 17.2 MB. This is strange because those came from the same asset catalog.p  pAfter some experimenting I found that it has to do with the iOS version. The extension target has iOS 8 as deployment target obviously and the main app still has iOS 7. When I change the deployment target of the main app to iOS 8 its compiled assets also become more then twice as largep  pMy guess is that for iOS 8 the asset compiler automatically generates 3x images for the iPhone 6 Plus, even though they are not provided explicitly. The problem is, I decided not to provide those on purpose to avoid an unnecessary increase of the apps size how ironic.... The scaledup version looked good enough for me. The app also works and looks as intended on the 6 Plus when built for iOS 7 with small assets.p  pstrongTLDRstrong For iOS 8 the asset compiler produces much larger results then for iOS 7.p  pIs there a way to tell it not to do sop

Negative 7979 pUsing visual studio 2012, I need to pass a string to a DLL in C.  To do this, in VB I create a string by codes  new string  , 100code, which creates a string codescode of 100 spaces.  I then pass this string which will be written into with less than 100 chars and it gets passed back with the new string as expected.  p  pin the declare function I use p  precode...,s as string... codepre  pAnd NOTp  precodeby reference s as string codepre  pHowever, if before passing this string but after creating it as described above I write a short string in VB into it such as codes  hi foxcode and then pass it into the DLL and write into it with a string longer then 6 chars, it crashesp  pThe lesson seems to be that after creating a blank string with the codenew stringcode function, you cannot write a shorter string into it.  It is as if the memory allocated to the string in VB becomes not the 100 chars that you created the string with but the size of the memory of codescode is now the size of the shorter string.p  pIf this is reasonable behavior, I would like to know.  It is quite different from the codenewcode function of C, in which the size of memory allocated is not changed by the size of the array you write to it.p  pThank you for any response and interest you may have.p

For instance, if someone was to select 9 as the hour  from dropdownlist1 and 25 as the minute from dropdownlist2, the two selections would store in a database as one unit of time 925 and could be selected from the database as a 925. p

Negative 7979 pI have followed the many helpful previous questions to get my AVPlayer successfully streaming video when my app goes to the background. There are two methods described on Apples QA1668 and they both work for my stream urls.p  pThe problem is that there is a noticeable audio gap during the transition that is identical for both methods. On my iPhone 6 in release mode I would say the gap is less than 0.5 seconds, which may not seem terrible but if Im playing something like a music video this is very distracting.p  pstrongAfter more testing it looks like this gap actually occurs when I remove the AVPlayerLayerstrong or, if I am using the other method, when I disable the AVMediaCharacteristicVisual tracks as I have determined it will still happen if I hook those actions up to a button rather than the backgrounding state.p  pMy guess is that is has something to do with the audio resyncing to the new video state of the AVPlayer but really I have no clue.

Negative 7979 pSince Azure agent doesnt support full VM image backups directly through the portal without shutting down the VM first, I wanted to schedule a regular bare metal backup of my Azure VMs using Windows Server Backup together with the Azure Backup agent. p  pThe challenge is to find a temporary place to store the files created by WSB while Azure Backup agent transfers them to the Azure backup store. I first thought the VM temporary disk  D  would be suitable, but it turns out that on some VMs the temp disk is smaller than the OS disk and would thus not have enough space.p  pAn option is of course to attach one extra 127 GB disk to each VM and use that as a destination volume for WSB backups and use Azure backup agent to backup that volume, but this would incur significant extra storage charges, since you would pay for both the extra disks storage and the backup storage.p  pThe best thing would of course be if the functionality of Azure backup agent was built into Windows Server backup, but this is not the case, unfortunately.p

Negative 7979 pI am trying to insert an external image into a MSFT Word Document. We do not need the image to appear quickly, but we need MSFT Word to allow the user to continue using Word without blocking the UI while it is loading the external image since some users have reported the Word application blocking the UI for several seconds. I have attempted to do this with various methodsp  ul liusing Word Interop to insert an HTML file containing img tags where the src attribute is the URI to the external imageli licreating a .DOTM file where one of the building blocks that I insert has an external relationship where the target is the URI to the external imageli licreating a .DOTM file with an altchunk to an HTML file with an img tag where the src attribute is the URI to the external imageli ul  pThe problem with any of the mentioned approaches is that MSFT Word blocks the UI while it is trying to load the external image. Even when using a Word .DOTM template, the Word application blocks the UI while it compiles the .DOTM template.p  pI have tried to mitigate this issue by testing the network before using any of the above techniques, but various users who appear to have unstable network conditions still complain that MSFT Word sometimes blocks the UI while it is loading the image. We will also need to allow these users to embed these external images while the are offline eventually.p  pThere are various reasons why the image must be external e.g. single point of update for content editors and we cannot load the image locally and then add a local reference e.g. our authors need to easily transfershare the document with the external image references intact.p  pFor the users who do use our software that can generate a gallery of images that our users can insert, its not so important that the image actually renders for them until they submit to their colleaguesclients. They would be fine with even the broken image that sometimes appears after Word has blocked for several seconds because they understand how the image would display when they finally push the document along their workflow.p  pI have attempted to preload the image in the WinINET cache, but it appears Word ignores that. Maybe there is an avenue there that I have not yet discovered I am also exploring if there is a hack that tricks MSFT Office into not even trying, potentially by convincing it that there is no internet connection and allow it to render the broken image without blocking the UI for an extended period of time.p

Negative 7979 pIs it okay for a site to use Express for handling the routing when using Server side rendered React templates rather than a hrefhttpsgithub.comracktreactrouter relnofollowReact Routerap  pI am looking to use Fluxxor similar to this a hrefhttpfluxxor.comguidesquickstart.html relnofollowexamplea for my components and storesactions. Then I was planning to use Express router to handle the page routing server side, and on each route render the desired component to string. In this basic example below my iapp.jsi is a simple todo example using Flux but in production it would likely be a top level component appropriate for the routed page. e.g. codeproductscode would be a product component, with its subcomponents.p  pHere is my basic server.js filep  precodevar express  requireexpress var React  requirereact var App  require.app  var app  express var port  4580   include my browserify bundle.js app.usepublic, express.staticdirname  public  app.get, functionreq, res     each route will render the particular component to string.    var markup  React.renderToStringApp   res.sendmarkup    I will seperate my views out like this  app.getproducts, product.list          app.getusers, user.list          app.getproductsid, product.list         codepre  pMy basic server side render approach is a hrefhttpsgithub.comStevenIsekireactexpressserver relnofollowherea if that helps. p  pSo as I was saying, Is it okay to use Express for the routing, as I am finding React Rouuter to be quite complex, and it just seems easier to have routes on the server, and to render each page with its components serverside.p  pAm I losing anything else here other than the complexity of handling the routing in Express rather than React Router As I think I can handle that, but want to make sure I havent messed up the point of server side rendering with React by just using Express to render to string based on different routes.p  pJust to be clear, Im okay with the issues which React Router aims to solve, and understand that I will be doing something similar to what was suggested in the React Router overview as being problematic in the long run.p  precode Not React Router API otherRouter.route, function     React.renderltDashboardRoutegt, document.body   otherRouter.routeinbox, function     React.renderltInboxRoutegt, document.body   otherRouter.routecalendar, function     React.renderltCalendarRoutegt, document.body  codepre  pbWhile one level of shared UI like this is pretty easy to handle, getting deeper and deeper adds more complexity.bp  pI am basically assuming that I can handle this complexity okay, whether that is true or not, I guess I will find out in time.p

Ideally, I would include this header in both main.cpp and class.cpp a class used in main, and be able to call the headers functions from either.p  pHowever, I cannot include it at the top of both, due to redefinition errors of everything defined in the header.

Negative 7979 pIve been working on a bootstrap carousel that has one major issue remaining. p  pA pause feature is required and this is working correctly when used, but when focus moves from the pause button the carousel resets to default settings and begins cycling again.p  pIve tried two more methods of stopping this behavior that havent worked changing the interval rather than calling pause and making the pause button set a flag that will hit a codesetIntervalcode for the window that triggers the pause.p  pIs there a better method to halt the carousel cycling permanently when the pause button is pressedp  pThe page also uses the adobe mega menu, which I included the scripts for in case they are causing the issue. p  precodelthtmlgt   ltheadgt      ltlink hrefcssbootstrapcombined.min.css relstylesheetgt     ltscript srchttpsajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.11.2jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript srcjsjqueryaccessibleMegaMenu.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript srcjsbootstrap.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript srcjsbootstrapcarousel.jsgtltscriptgt    ltheadgt    ltbodygt     ltdiv classpagewrappergt         lt content starts here gt         ltdiv classcontentgt             ltcentergt                 ltdiv idmyCarousel classcarousel slide dataridecarouselgt                   lt Indicators gt                     ltol classcarouselindicatorsgt                         ltli datatargetmyCarousel dataslideto0 classactivegtltligt                         ltli datatargetmyCarousel dataslideto1gtltligt                         ltli datatargetmyCarousel dataslideto2gtltligt                         ltli datatargetmyCarousel dataslideto3gtltligt                     ltolgt                      lt Wrapper for slides gt                     ltdiv classcarouselinner rolelistboxgt                         ltdiv classitem activegt                             ltimg srchttpplacehold.it800x300 altEXCEL 2015gt                         ltdivgt                          ltdiv classitemgt                             ltimg srchttpplacehold.it700x300 altEEO Programsgt                         ltdivgt                          ltdiv classitemgt                             ltimg srchttpplacehold.it800x300 altPlace holdgt                         ltdivgt                          ltdiv classitemgt                             ltimg srchttpplacehold.it600x300 altFlowergt                         ltdivgt                     ltdivgt                      lt Left and right controls gt                     lta classleft carouselcontrol hrefmyCarousel rolebutton dataslideprevgt                         ltspan classglyphicon glyphiconchevronleftgtltspangt                     ltagt                     lta classright carouselcontrol hrefmyCarousel rolebutton dataslidenextgt                         ltspan classglyphicon glyphiconchevronrightgtltspangt                     ltagt                      lt Play and Pause gt                     ltdiv idcarouselButtonsgt                         ltinput typebutton classbtn startslide valuePlay idplayButtongt                         ltinput typebutton classbtn pauseslide valuePause idpauseButtongt                     ltdivgt                 ltdivgt             ltcentergt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt      lt Nav menu scripts gt     ltscriptgt         navfirst.accessibleMegaMenu              prefix for generated unique id attributes, which are required                 to indicate ariaowns, ariacontrols and arialabelledby              uuidPrefix accessiblemegamenu,               css class used to define the megamenu styling              menuClass navmenu,               css class for a toplevel navigation item in the megamenu              topNavItemClass navitem,               css class for a megamenu panel              panelClass subnav,               css class for a group of items within a megamenu panel              panelGroupClass subnavgroup,               css class for the hover state              hoverClass hover,               css class for the focus state              focusClass focus,               css class for the open state              openClass open              ltscriptgt     lt carousel scripts gt     ltscriptgt         document.readyfunction              myCarousel.carousel                 interval 2000,                 pause false                                        playButton.clickClickOnPlayButton          function ClickOnPlayButton             myCarousel.carouselcycle                       pauseButton.clickClickOnPauseButton          function ClickOnPauseButton             myCarousel.carouselpause                  ltscriptgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 7979 pI have a class that converts a ArcGIS ShapeFile to WKB for insertion into MySQL.  The WKB representation of the geometries is written to a temporary file, and then passed to GeomFromWKB via PDOStatementbindParam using PARAMLOB.  Everything works fine on my test server, which is setup to have identical software as my live server, but when I try to import a new shapefile on the live site, MySQL throws the following errorp  blockquote   pSQLSTATE[22003] Numeric value out of range 1416 Cannot get geometry object from data you send to the GEOMETRY fieldp blockquote  pI have verified that the WKB file is being generated the same on both servers, and bindParam returns success.  All the MySQL settings are the same, and the database structures are identical.  It seems as if the WKB data is not being sent with the query though, and I am out of ideas as to why that would be the case.p  pHere is the SQL statement that sends the WKB.p  precode stream returns the file handle to the temporary WKB file. wkb   boundarygtstream stmt  DBprepareUPDATE boundaryshape SET shapeGeomFromWkbwkb WHERE boundaryidid stmtgtbindParamid,  boundaryid stmtgtbindParamwkb, wkb, PDOPARAMLOB stmtgtexecute codepre  pAny ideas on why it may work on one server, and not the other would be appreciated.p
Negative 7979 pI am evaluating the Disruptor library for a data processing application platform. Specifically I would evaluate against Akka actor framework and plain Java executor service, fitting to our problem domain.p  pFor instantiating a new Disruptor queue, should I say, we need to provide an instance of ExecutorService v3.3.2. When I check sample codes for Disruptor, in almost every cases I see cached thread pool is being passed. I have a single consumer EventHandler scenario. In such a condition, is there any difference if I use a single thread executor insteadp

Negative 7979 pIm working with a Linux embedded SMP system that does audio IO using ALSA and an external USB Audio device, using a 3.6.6. kernel. Problem Im getting infrequent once every few weeks system hiccups that are causing the audio stream to die. Although its tough to be sure, the hiccups look like they lock up the entire system for a few dozens of milliseconds.p  pI can write ALSA code to recover after one of these hiccups, but since its ALSA some trial and error will be required. Add that to having to wait weeks for a reoccurrence, and Ill be up a creek with a crowbar. I really need a way to cause the problem on demand.p  pId like to write a C program that runs as root and blocks all other processes on the system for a given number of milliseconds. I imagine it would involve disabling interrupts, doing a delay loop since the timers will probably fail, and then restoring interrupts. But, I have to do it in such a way that the whole system doesnt go belly up.p  pAny ideas on how I would write such a programp

Negative 7979 pWe are running into cases where we change a property on our entity but the codePropertyChangedcode event doesnt fire.  We are doing this logic as part of a Save and so the problem seems to be the way DevForce queues events like this during a Save.p  pLooking at the code for LoadingBlock.Dispose, I see thisp  precodepublic void Dispose      this.entityManager.FireQueuedEvents     this.entityManager.IsLoadingEntity  this.wasLoadingEntity  codepre  pThere is a race condition there that you fire the queued events before changing the codeIsLoadingEntitycode property.  That means that any new events that get generated during the FireQueuedEvents will get queued since codeIsLoadingEntitycode will still be true but events that get queued then will never get fired since we already fired the queued events that we knew about.  It seems like DevForce should reset the IsLoadingEntity flag before firing the events.  I think that would solve our problems.p  pHere is some code that might help explain our case.  Ill use a Merge call instead of SaveChanges since its easier to use in a unit testp  precodeCreate the main Entity Manager and a test entity var em  new EntityManager var entity  new MyEntity SID  123 em.AttachEntityentity  Create a second copy of the entity and another Entity Manager  this is just so    we can trigger a merge and see the bad behavior var copy  new MyEntity  SID  123, MergeCount  20  var em2  new EntityManager em2.AttachEntitycopy  This code is a bit contrived but its similar to what we are doing in our actual app em.EntityChanged  sender, args gt      If it is a MyEntity that changed and it was from a Merge, increment the MergeCount property     var e  args.Entity as MyEntity     if e  null ampamp args.Action  EntityAction.ChangeCurrentAndOriginal              e.MergeCount        Set up a PropertyChanged event handler to see what properties got changed according to INotifyPropertyChanged var propertiesChanged  new Listltstringgt entity.PropertyChanged  sender, args gt  propertiesChanged.Addargs.PropertyName   Merge the copy entity em2.CacheStateManager.GetCacheState.Mergeem, RestoreStrategy.Normal  At this point, the MergeCount property will be 21  as expected Assert.AreEqual21, entity.MergeCount  We should have seen a PropertyChanged event for MergeCount since we changed the property it was 20 and we set it to 21 Assert.IsTruepropertiesChanged.ContainsMergeCount  In the debugger, if we look at em.queuedEvents, well see some items in there.  One of the items is the PropertyChanged event   for MergeCount.  It fired but was queued...and it will be queued forever because the LoadingBlock is long gone. codepre  pIve found that I can just do another Merge from an empty Entity Manager and that will cause the previously queued events to fire.  That is an okay workaround in one case that we ran into this.  But I fear there might be other places where we are running into this issue and that workaround wont work for us.p

Negative 7979 pIm primarily an Electrical hardware engineer with a very little knowledge in php, javascript and similar languages.p  pIm building a system that will track my device in a real time and visually display current GPS position of it on a Google map. My device is able to properly send data about its position latitude and longitude as often as I want. GPS position data is sent using a HTTP communication protocol GET requests and is stored on a server side in a .txt file called gps.txt. p  pphp script extracts data from that gps.txt file and displays them on a Google map. p  pa hrefhttpsjumpshare.comvsDzlHXhPkUszOKJxVuhB relnofollowHerea is the script written in php I applied my own API key for properly use Google maps.p  pThis script runs on some free web hosting platform. Take a look a hrefhttpcreativelab.byethost15.comGPS.php relnofollowherea.p  pNow, the trouble comes when I call the script from my web browser. Namely, although a gps.txt data is properly refreshed with a fresh data, these new position markers are NOT displayed on the map. It seems that either my web browser or my web server are cashing some data and dont allow the script to run over a fresh gps.txt file.p  pI suppose that, for many of you web software guys out there, this is a trivial problem.p  pI also tried to prevent data cashing on my browser by including p  precodeheaderCacheControl nocache, mustrevalidate  HTTP1.1 headerExpires Mon, 26 Jul 1997 050000 GMT  Date in the past codepre  pin my script but with NO success.p  pWould you, please, give me any suggestion on how to overcome this situation and always have the latest GPS position displayed on my mapp  pThank you very much for your time and effort to help me.p  pSincerely,p  pBojanp
Negative 7979 pI want to be able to read an excel file from a python script, have the script still running, and be able to edit the from excel.  Preferably without having to modify my code too much.

Try again later.  How can I close the file from my script Ive tried OESwb.close but it gives the error Workbook object has no attribute close.  I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11214908closingfilesinopenpyxl1121583911215839this posta but it doesnt seem to be helping.p  pEDIT It appears OESwb.savefilename.xlsx works, but only if useiteratorsFalse and readonlyFalse.  However, it would be ideal to be able to close the file and still be in readonly mode.  It appears this is a bug with openpyxl since it should close the file after loadworkbook is finished.p

Negative 7979 pI have 3 devices Not including phones. 1 Desktop, 1 Laptop and 1 Tablet all of which is running on Intel x8664 CPUs. The Desktop and Laptop has Fedora installed while the Tablet, being a nonlinux supported BayTrail, has Window 8.1. I mostly work on the Desktop and Laptop, but some times the Tablet is used for smaller things. I have Android Studio installed on all 3 devices using Copy.com to sync up all of the work, backed by git. p  pMost of this is working fine, but there is a small problem. The Desktop and Laptop is easy to get to work together since I use the exact same file system layout on both. But the Tablet, running on Windows, is another thing. Android Studio saves the SDK path in the file local.properties for each project. Since the project dirs resides within the Copy.com folder, all changes are synced between all 3 devices. This creates problem since the SDK path differs between the Linux devices and the Windows Tablet. Every time I switch between the OSs, this path needs updating. p  pIs there a way to make this path a global Android Studio configuration that is not stored in the project dirs p

If I create them, manually change them to View Mode and then modify the charts, they seem to remain in View Mode.  Its a bit of a hassle though as there are a fair amount of charts.  And every time someone uses it for the first time, they would have to do this, so Im just trying to see if it can be avoided.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 7979 pIn a highchart highstock object, I want to understand the difference between chart.options.yAxis and chart.yAxis.p  pWhen I add a yaxis to the chart I see an object getting added to both the places. It also removes from both the places if I remove an axis. I see a discrepancy when using navigator, as chart.yAxis contains an object for navigator whereas chart.options.yAxis does not contain an object for navigator. p  pMy doubt is how should I update yAaxis dynamically  Here is a scenario My chart loads with 2 yAxis. So the chart.YAxis array contains the 2 yAxis I loaded the chart with plus an object for the navigator total 3. Now, when I add another axis dynamically using chart.addAxis it becomes the 4th index in chart.yAxis and the 3rd index in chart.options.yAxis. Which index should I be using if I want to update this new axis dynamically using chart.yAxis[].update. p  pNote that now if I update the axis using the 4th index chart.yAxis[3].update it adds another item in the chart.options.yAxis array, hence now chart.options.yAxis contains 2 items for the same axis.p
