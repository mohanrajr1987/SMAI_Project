By clicking in various parts of the third button, it appears that the lower 93 pixels of the scroll view is not passing touch events through to its subviews.p  p93 is suspicious its also the combined height of the tab bar 49 pixels and navigation bar 44 pixels. Yet the navigation bar and tab bar are outside the scroll view.

Negative 27080 pI just want to ask whether I am right or not about .NET. So, .NET is new framework that enables you to easily implement new and old windows functions. It is similar to java in the way that its also compiled into bytecode, but its name is Common Language Infrastructure, or CLI. This language is interpreted by .NET Framework, so code generated by programming using .NET cannot be executed directly by CPU. Now, few languages can be compiled to CLI. First, it was Microsoftdeveloped C, than J, C others. I suspect that this is in general right, at least I hope I understand it right. p  pBut, what I am still missing is, can you write to machine code compiled code in C And, if using Visual Studio 2005, when I select Win32 project, it is compiled into machine code, so only thing you need to run this apps are windows dynamiclink libraries, since static libraries code is implemented into app during linking phase. And those dynamiclink libraries are implemented in every windows installation, or provided by DirectX installations. p  pBut when I select CLR in Visual Studio 2005, than app is compiled into CLI code, and it first executes .NET framework, and than .NET framework executes that program, since its not in machine code. p  pSo, I am right I ask because you can read these infos on the internet, but I have no one to tell me whether I understand it right or not. Thanks.    p

Negative 27080 pI need to create a system oriented around Methods where providers can register for the Methods they handle and consumers can do two things for now  either get Metadata for a method or execute it. Im considering creating a REST style architecture where methods are resources with unique URIs and an interface consisting of two methods  getMetadata and Execute.p  pIll need to have an equivalent of RequestMapping so that the provider that handles specific methods can be located by the central dispatcher. As a result the provider will return either Model or Metadata object.p  pThis looks pretty similar to Spring MVC but I dont want to expose and consume my resourcesmethods over the web and use http as this will incur unnecessary overhead. Instead I want to use it like a standard java API where java methods are called and java objects are transferred. I can do that by writing my own equivalent of RequestMapping and Dispatcher logic but I was wondering if theres a better way to do this with Spring. Any suggestionsp  pThanks Kostadin p

Negative 27080 pI get the concept behind a a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTriestrongtriestronga. But I get a little confused when it comes to implementation.p  pThe most obvious way I could think to structure a codeTriecode type would be to have a codeTriecode maintain an internal codeDictionaryltchar, Triegtcode. I have in fact written one this way, and it emworksem, but... this seems like overkill. My impression is that a trie should be lightweight, and having a separate codeDictionaryltchar, Triegtcode for emevery nodeem does not seem very lightweight to me.p  pIs there a more appropriate way to implement this structure that Im missingp  hr  pstrongUPDATEstrong OK Based on the very helpful input from Jon and leppie, this is what Ive come up with so farp  p1 I have the codeTriecode type, which has a private codenodescode member of type codeTrie.INodeCollectioncode.p  p2 The codeTrie.INodeCollectioncode interface has the following members  p  precodeinterface INodeCollection      bool TryGetNodechar key, out Trie node     INodeCollection Addchar key, Trie node     IEnumerableltTriegt GetNodes  codepre  p3 There are three implementations of this interface  p  precodeclass SingleNode  INodeCollection      internal readonly char key     internal readonly Trie trie      public SingleNodechar key, Trie trie      ...

Add adds to the dictionary and returns the current instance.  codepre  p4 When a codeTriecode is first constructed, its codenodescode member is codenullcode. The first call to codeAddcode creates a codeSingleNodecode, and subsequent calls to codeAddcode go from there, according to the steps described above.p  pDoes this make sense This feels like an improvement in the sense that it emsomewhatem reduces the bulkiness of a codeTriecode nodes are no longer fullblown codeDictionaryltchar, Triegtcode objects until they have a sufficient number of children.

Negative 27080 pIm developing a virtual machine for purely functional programs, and I would like to be able to test and use the the wide variety of Haskell modules already available.  The VM takes as input essentially terms in the untyped lambda calculus.  Im wondering what would be a good way to extract such a representation from modern Haskell modules eg. with MPTCs, pattern guards, etc..   I did a little research and there doesnt seem to be a tool that does this already I would be delighted to be mistaken, and thats okay.  Im looking for an approach.p  pGHC Core seems too operationally focused, especially since one of the things the VM does is to change the evaluation order significantly. Are there any accessible intermediate representations that correspond more closely to the lambda calculusp
Negative 27080 pI would like to make a workaround to use UDP transport on iOS4 instead TCP, bypassing the limitations of Apple iOS4 multitasking support with regards to VoIP applications as in seems to do the softphone Bria for iPhone a hrefhttpitunes.apple.comappbriaiphoneeditionid373968636mt8 relnofollowhttpitunes.apple.comappbriaiphoneeditionid373968636mt8a, because many SIP providers does not support TCP, so it is important to try to implement a workaround, in order to be able to receive incoming calls on their UDPbased SIP account while the SIPVoIP client is running in the background. The app should not go the suspended state when pushed to the background and should instead continue to run and allow you to receive incoming calls on UDPbased accounts. Is it possible to do that as completing a not finite length task in the background or playind a file audio continuosly Does someone have  any idea Thanks in advance.p

Negative 27080 pIn vanilla emacs, I load the TAGS file, and do a lookup of a symbol with M..  I go right to the definition of the symbol.p  pWhen using Icicles, I get 374 hits for the same symbol.  While I can in theory chip away the nonelephant slowly to find what I want, thats a pain, and I end up just turning off icicles for the tag lookup, and turning it back on.p  pstrongIs there any way to tell icicles that I just want the definition when I do a tags lookup, and not every relevant match in the tags filestrongp  pFor instance, I might search for the definition of the taskstruct structure in the linux kernel source code.

Negative 27080 pI am working on a project that is a customized and specific CMS. In the frontend many of the fields will have prepopulated choices. However for these fields there needs to be an Other option that allows for a user entered text string. The project scope does not want these new other values to be added to the prepopulated lists now or in the further. It is just an exception. The project scope is insistent on this flexibility which is implemented throughout the app.p  pI have database tables that contain all these prepopulated lists. I call these tables my list tables all begin with listp  pMy question is about storing the choices a user makes. If it was not for this flexibility I would store the value as a foreign key to the appropriate list table. However, it makes sense for these fields to store the valuestring rather then the key. The drawbacks are indexing minor, content control minor, global updates i.e. changing a value in the list table will not retroripple through the system unless coded to pretty big issue. p  pI will also mention that storing the data as values and not keys makes the programming and functions much simpler too I am writing a service layer and it cuts down on joins and allows functions to be more generic.p  pStore as a valuestring not a key is the course the team is wanting to go. p  pAm I making a big mistake by doing this Or is this fairly common Are there other issues to considerp  pAlternatives My alternative would be to add the Other string as a new row in the lists table and use a field to make it hidden. p

Negative 27080 pThere are several situations where you might override a super classs property.p  ol lipYou declare a property with the same name and same attribute of its superclass.since if you change the attribute you can get an compiler warning.And you can synthesieze with an ivar that you create. Whats the use of this Or whats the harm can it dopli lipIf a superclass declares a property in a class extension a category with no name, then it might not be in the header file. If you dont know that property from the header file, you can declare the same name property with what ever attribute or class you want. But the settergetter method will override the ones for that secret property. I think this can only do harm. But since you dont know from the header file, how can you avoid thispli lipYou can declare a property in the header file as readonly and in class extension redeclare it as readwrite. I think this is the situation that it can do good.pli ol  pIs my understanding about these situations right And I dont know what good the first and second situations can do. But if I want to avoid the first situation, I can check if the subclass already has the property before I declare it.

Later in the entry the author goes on to say p  blockquote   pIndustry leading recording technology   converts manual tests to automated   tests to be reexecuted build after   build to ensure minimal regressions   and to keep manual testers always   focusing on new issues.p blockquote  pstrongDoes anybody know what recording technology Google usesstrong Im familiar with Windows macro software such as AutoHotKey and AutoIt, but neither of them strike me as being able to save that much time ie I suspect one would spend so much time trying to debug issues with the recording and getting it to rerun on arbitrary systems, etc. that they would quickly eat up any savings gained by being able to rerun the test more quickly on the next X runs.p  pIm crossing my fingers hoping for someone with a little bit of inside information as to what Google actually uses for this, but if anyone knows any other pieces of recording technology that might fulfill the criteria in that quote, let me know.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 27080 pI come from a webdevelopment background.  Ive been playing around with a bit of Java recently and have come across the following issue that seems to stem from the strict interfaces and datatyping which are more part of Java than they are of PHP.p  pI am using an existing physics engine a hrefhttpwww.cokeandcode.comphys2d relnofollowPhys2Da to develop a game of sorts.  This  physics engine has codeBodycode objects managed by a codeWorldcode, and have various forces applied to them as the world is stepped.  It is important for the AI in the game that the bodies have colours so that they can be sensed, but this is not supported by the physics engine, so Ive created a subclass, and extended the codeBodycode class to include this  a hrefhttppastebin.com1nLYWg3w relnofollowhttppastebin.com1nLYWg3wa.  Now when I create these codeBodycode instances, I can get them back from the codeWorldcode and get their colours.p  pHowever, Netbeans is saying that itp  precodecannot find symbol     symbol   method getColour     location class net.phys2d.raw.Body codepre  pbecause the codeBodycode objects returned by the physics engine interface do not contain this method.  I know that, at runtime, emallem the codeBodycode objects that are passed to the codeWorldcode will actually be objects of codeColouredBodycode type, and so will have this method defined in their interfaces.p  pHow can I attach colours to the codeBodycode objects and not produce scary underscores and warnings  I understand that I can alter Phys2D itself but, potential licensing restrictions aside the licence says that you emcanem do this with Phys2D, I am told that this is bad practice.p

Negative 27080 pIm working on a logging program, and Id like to avoid processing the same codeExceptioncode object repeatedly when it is being logged repeatedly because it is percolating up through a nested call structure. So Id like to be able to format the codeExceptioncode object once, and give the formatted version a unique exception number and then tag the codeExceptioncode object somehow so I can recognize it if it turns up again in a later log call.p  pThe idea Ive come up with is to misuse the codeHelpLinkcode field of the codeExceptioncode object. Ill set it to contain a string version of my exception number. Then I can recognize the codeExceptioncode object if it shows up again momentarily in another log call.p  pBut is this maybe a bad idea Are there any gotchas involved that I havent thought of If so, does anyone have a better ideap  pEDIT To explain the situation a bit more, this logger will only be used on my own programs. p
Negative 27080 pI have two libraries, for example two toaster libraries stronglibtoastera.sostrong and stronglibtoasterb.sostrong and all the associated majorminorrev symlinks eg stronglibtoastera.so.1.0.0strong etc. Both libraries implement the same toaster interface, but simply do the processing differently. Hence when I build an application that uses the library it doesnt matter which is used from the applications perspective they are the same.p  pBecause I would like to decide which library to use after the application has been compiled and distributed I make a symbolic link stronglibtoaster.sostrong which points to stronglibtoaster.so.1strong which can then point to either stronglibtoastera.so.1strong and stronglibtoasterb.so.1strong. Hence the userinstaller could simply change the stronglibtoaster.so.1strong link to choose the implementation to use.p  pFor the build say I have stronglibtoaster.so.1strong linked to stronglibtoastera.so.1strong by default. when I compile my application eg strongmyappstrong by something like codegcc o myapp ltoaster...code it compiles and even runs with stronglibtoastera.so.1strong correctly. However if I run ldd on myapp I will see it is linked to stronglibtoastera.so.1strong rather than stronglibtoaster.so.1strong as desired, hence changing the stronglibtoaster.so.1strong link has no effect. p  pIs there a nicer way to fix this than making stronglibtoastera.so.1strong, renaming it to  stronglibtoaster.so.1strong, making myapp against this library then deleting stronglibtoaster.so.1strong and creating it as a symbolic link againp

Negative 27080 pthis may seem a bit vagueconfusing but i hope you can get it.p  pIm filling arrays from a XML. These arrays have dynamic textFields inside them, and these textFields are childs of a movieclip.p  pI tween this movieclip, therefore making the array of textFields animate on the stage one by one. There are two sources of XML, one from an actual site, and another from a XML stored in the hdd. First i fill the arrays of textFields, and then animate the movieclip. I do this for the first one, then animate it, do it again for the 2nd one, animate it, again for the 1st one, animate it, so on so on.p  pcodemyTween  new Tweenmc,x,None.easeNone,sizeOfStage,0  mc.width,mcSpeedAuto,truecodep  pmy tween ends at code0  mc.widthcode, the problem is, if i tween first the  bigger XML, when the next one which is smaller gets tweened, theres loads of empty space before it tweens the big one again tweening whitespace.p  pcodemyTween.addEventListenerTweenEvent.MOTIONFINISH, onFinishcodep  pcodeonFinishcode i clear all the arrays otherwise the tweening of the 2nd one would still have information of the 1st one e.g 1st has 25 fields, second has 10, 1st shows its 25 fields, 2nd shows 10, and the 15 that were left from from the 1st one and call the tween on the 2nd one. I thought that by doing this id be clearing all that white space too, apparently not. I think the codemc.widthcode just keeps the bigger value and always tweens with that, taking longer to end in the 2nd case. Ive tried setting the mc.width as the sum of textfield widths everytime i fill the arrays, but this hasnt worked either, so im not quite sure what the problem is p  pIs this too confusing Any ideasp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 27080 pI have made a WCF REST service which consumes data from an OLAP database and it is not Microsoft technology, ultimately, I would like to connect many other OLAP database to a single platform.p  pAnd after a lot of reading, the security for WCF REST is very discouraging, in summary, I have 2 choices, one is to use the Basic Authentication which expose username and password over the wire, or maybe a bit better, using Basic Authentication with SSL, now I need to get different certificates from the webserver. Or using Digest Authentication, which use an encrypted password and authenticate against the database, thats the best option, but in my case, it is not possible as I am not using Microsoft technology, the security is on different platform and I cannot encrypt my password using MD5 because the database cannot read the encrypted password.p  pThat concludes me only be able to use Basic Authentication with SSL, but is this the correct way of doing I see many products out there doing something similar to what I do, when they login, I do not see https, but only http, are they not secure and easy to hackp  pI am not trying to make a bullet proof website, but a simple website, using Basic Authentication is too simple, or in fact its almost like giving away the password, but using https, is that overkillp  pSo, after REST being that discouraging, lets not use REST, use the normal WCF, from what I have read, they shares the same problem.p  pPlease give me some guidance.

Is there a way to reference a codepixelcode in the grid so that I can access its properties as a neighbor of the current pixel in the list Ive thought about creating a codeint[,] map  new int[width,height]code containing the indexes of the pixels in the list, but this creates a problem when a pixel is removed from the list and map would need to be updated every time a pixel is removed from the list.p  pAlternatively, is there a way I can linkpoint to the neighbors of a pixel in the class itself such that schematically I could access a neighbors propertiesp  precodelist[0].NeighborE   null list[0].NeighborNE  B list[0].neighborN   null ... list[1].NeighborE   G list[1].NeighborNE  D list[1].NeighborN   C list[1].NeighborNW  null ... if list[i].NeighborE.ClusterNumber gt 2     list[i].ClusterNumber  2 codepre  pAny adviceguidance would be appreciated.p

Flixel doesnt have any built in touchscreen functions so I am overriding codeonTouchEventMotionEvent eventcode in my Activity codeFlixelDemo.javacode in the tutorial and hopefully getting the coordinates of the touch.p  pI then have a function in my codePlayer.javacode that given the touch coordinates could tell me whether my player has been touched.p  pThe problem I am having is trying to figure out how to get tocall that function codeisCollisioncode from in the activity.p  pIt seems that I can only override the onTouchEvent in codeFlixelDemo.javacode and that I can only use the codeisCollisioncode function in codeGameState.javacode where I add the player.p  pHow do I get the info from the overridden touch event to any of my other classes Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong or help me figure out a different way of implementing touch eventsp

Negative 27080 pI have a Java EE app server jbosseap4.3 and several .wars that make up a larger web application.  The idea is that a .war can be run separately or linked from another .war.

I thought realms might be a good place to look for this, but I didnt turn up anything promising.p  pNote that there are still other web apps in this container with a completely different securitydomain, so a global setting for tomcat may not be appropriate.p

Negative 27080 pMy project has a reporting module that gathers data from the database in the form of XML and runs an XSLT on it to generate the users desired format of report. Options at this point are HTML and CSV.p  pWe use Java and Xalan to do all interaction with the data.p  pThe bad part is that one of these reports that the user can request is 143MB about 430,000 records for just the XML portion.

This is unacceptable.p  pIt seems that the problem is simply too much data, but I cant help but think there is a better way to deal with this than limiting the customer and not being able to meet functional requirements.p  pI am glad to give more information as needed, but I cannot disclose too much about the project as Im sure most of you understand.

If someone could point me at a resource detailing those limitations, it would be very helpful.p

Negative 27080 pIm working in C on a PC, trying to leverage as little C as possible, working with binary data stored in unsigned char format, although other formats are certainly possible if worthwhile.  The goal is subtracting two signed integer values which can be ints, signed ints, longs, signed longs, signed shorts, etc.  in binary without converting to other data formats.  The raw data is just prepackaged as unsigned char, though, with the user basically knowing which of the signed integer formats should be used for reading i.e. we know how many bytes to read at once.  Even though data is stored as an unsigned char array, data are meant to be read signed as twoscomplement integers.p  pOne common way were often taught in school is adding the negative.  Negation, in turn, is often taught to be performed as flipping bits and adding 1 0x1, resulting in two additions perhaps a bad thing or, as other posts point out, flipping bits past the first zero starting from the MSB.  Im wondering if there is a more efficient way, that may not be easily described as a penandpaper operation, but works because of the way data is stored in bit format.  Here are some prototypes Ive written, which may not be the most efficient way, but which summarizes my progress so far based on textbook methodology.p  pThe addends are passed by reference in case I have to manually extend them to balance their length.

Negative 27080 pIm getting confused about the various options in the a hrefhttptwitter.github.combootstrapscaffolding.html5Ctwitter bootstrap grida, and how they go together. p  pTo begin with, you can have an ordinary fixed codecontainercode, or a codecontainerfluidcode. p  pThen either one can include either an ordinary coderowcode, or a fluid row, coderowfluidcode. That is, you can have a fixed container with a fluid row, or a containerfluid... with a fixed rowp  pThen on top of that, you can include the responsive media queries, or not. p  pI am getting confused as to how these things interact. But lets start with one obvious example. p  pOn a hrefhttptwitter.github.combootstrapscaffolding.htmlthe examples pagea itself, theres whats presented as an example of both a a hrefhttptwitter.github.combootstrapscaffolding.htmlgridSystemfixed grida and a a hrefhttptwitter.github.combootstrapscaffolding.htmlfluidGridSystemfluid gridap  pHowever, in my browser, on that example page itself  both grids behave identically. Perhaps because the example page uses the optional responsive media queries  In strongbothstrong grid examples, if I start gradually narrowing my browser window, the grid elements do emnotem get gradually narrower  once a certain responsive boundary width is reached, they snap to a smaller size, and again at further boundary widths.  But both the ordinary fixed example AND the fluid example behave exactly the same here  so what the heck is the differencep

Negative 27080 pI am currently running 2 versions of PHP. My local test server has 5.3.5, while my remote live server has 5.2.4. This has caused a few compatibility issues in the past, but Ive always been able to fix them pretty easily. Soon my remote server will be upgraded, so it wont cause too many more issues, but in the mean time I still have to provide solutions for these stupid compatibility issues. Will someone please take a look at my code below and let me know if they spot any issues for a 5.2.4 PHP buildp  precodefunction cookiename, value      expire  strtotime1 month     oldexpire  strtotimelast day of next month      setcookie         name,         value,         expire          vardumpname, value, expire, oldexpire   date  date     Ymd His,     filemtimefile  cookieuser, bobworks cookieup2date, datedoes not codepre  pI originally had last day of next month as my cookie expiration date, which is why its still in the codevardumpcode list. However, that string was returning false on the remote server causing cookies to expire at the end of the session. Even though it returned false, it would still set the user cookie and I was able to view it in the browser. It would not, however, set the up2date cookie. I thought this was odd, but figured it had something to do with the codestrtotimecode function returning false. So I tried fixing that first. After consulting the PHP manual I determined that the string I was using was only available on 5.3. There, problem confirmed, easy fix. I replaced it with the 1 month string, which I know will work on 5.2. Success, my user cookie now expires as it should. Except I still dont have an up2date cookie. codevardumpcode proves that the function is being called to set it and has all the correct parameters but it isnt setting the second cookie. I wouldnt be as frustrated if it just didnt work at all. That would at least tell me that I was doing something wrong and I could weedle it out. But for it to tease me like this...

Negative 27080 pGiven an amount of points in x and y I want to create splines that intersect all points and that have the same slopes in intersections.p  pMy approach has been to establish a set of equations for intersection of points as well as dictating equal slopes at intersections and then use fsolve to determine coefficients.p  pHowever, when plotting the found splines they do not have the same slopes at intersecting points though they do intersect the correct points given in x and y.p  pI have been trying to debug this script for most of two days now without any luck.

Negative 27080 pI use Task Scheduler to automate a variety of nightly tasks using Excel. Typically the task opens a new instance of Excel, which in turn opens a specified file, which does some stuff and closes itself and Excel.p  pNow I have a task that requires an addin, and use of the addin requires separate authentication. There is no way to pass my credentials  I have to manually authenticate when the addin loads. Because the oldfashioned way always launches a new unauthenticated instance, I cant figure out how fully automate tasks that require the addin.p  pOne workaround would be to open an instance of Excel before I leave, authenticate for the addin, and leave that instance open. Then I could theoretically schedule the opening of some file within that instance as opposed to launching a new instance to open the file, as described above and do whatever the tasks were that required the addin.p  pIs it possible to do this, either directly by defining the task a certain way, or in a .bat file that I can run on a schedulep
Negative 27080 pI am trying to understand how live audio streaming is accomplished as far as buffer management goes.p  pFor the audio case if you have a source capturing a frames at 44100hz  clock error, and a receiver with an audio card DAC consuming frames at 44100hz  clock error. p  pBecause of the clock errors at each end the buffer at the receiver would eventually either grow out of control or under run.p  pFor one source live streaming to many receivers a flow control stream is not possible.p  pMy only guess at a solution would be to keep track of buffer fill at the receiver over a longer period than network jitter effects and either insert samples or drop samples.p  pAny insight on this would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 27080 pI need to get the last inserted row in a specific table for strictly the current session.  I cant use codeIDENTITYcode and codeSCOPEIDENTITYcode as they will return the last inserted identity for ANY table.  The problem with codeIDENTCURRENTcode is that it will return the last inserted identity of a record for a specific table but for ANY session.  This is a problem for me because the codeINSERTcode is called by multiple sessions, and I specifically need the identity of the last inserted record for my specific session.p  pAny pointers how to accomplish this  p  pps. the codeINSERTcode statement is not inside a SPROC, so SPROC solutions are not viable.p  pThanksp

Negative 27080 pIm having some trouble reading a blob back from a MySQL database. Ive gotten it to successfully insert into the database, but cant seem to get it to read back. I know some of you might be thinking why is he using a database to store blobs for images, and not just the file paths  file names, but i want to have flexibility and as a lot of these images will be stored on a server and not locally, this optimises efficiency, as well as allowing me to move images to local if needed.

Negative 27080 pI have several plots on one figure.  One is a 3D plot, the rest are 2D.  When I select Zoom on the toolbar, left clicking on the mouse uses the codezoom.mcode functions, and in 3D, it looks like it uses codecamzoom.mcode.  However, when I right click to bring up the context menu, the Reset to Original View looks like it only works on the 2D plots.  For the 3D plot, selecting this either does nothing or it loses the xaxis limits, and therefore the plot shows no data points I cant get it to work consistently.p  pIm trying to come up with a workaround for this problem.p  pI would like to override the context menu for just the 3D plot with my own function that would redraw the plot, and leave the default context menu for the 2D plots.

However, being a codeSetcode, it does not support duplicate elements.  Also, being a a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavautilSortedSet.html relnofollowcodeSortedSetcodea, the ordering must be consistent with codeequalscode and codehashCodecode to avoid violating the contract of the codeSetcode interface.p  pIs there any good alternative data structure for when there might be duplicate elements or multiple elements that are equal according to the natural ordering or Comparator but not equal according to the codeequalscode method  As a motivating example, consider the following code that shows why a codeNavigableSetcode is not appropriatep  precodepublic class Foo implements ComparableltFoogt   double x   double y    Override   public int compareToFoo o      return Double.comparex, o.x   only x matters for sort order       public static void mainString...args     Foo a  new Foo     a.x  1     a.y  2      Foo b  new Foo     b.x  1     b.y  42      Foo c  new Foo     c.x  2     c.y  12.34      NavigableSetltFoogt set  new TreeSetltFoogt     set.adda     set.adda     set.addb     set.addc      System.out.printlnset.size     codepre  pNotice that element codeacode only gets added once of course, since this is a codeSetcode.  Also, notice that codebcode does not get added, since there is already an element for which the comparison returns 0.p  pI felt like this was probably a fairly common thing, so I hoped to find an existing implementation rather than rolling my own.  Is there a good, widelyused data structure for my purposesp  pIll add that while writing this question I did come across the a hrefhttpcode.google.compbiscotti relnofollowBiscotti Projecta, but a Im not convinced it solves the comparisonequals issue and b the FAQ explicitly says its not really safe to use.p

I lack the Rfu to do the transform from one to the other, though it looks like it should be straightforward.p  pBonus pointsp  pThe actual problem is a bit more complex, because the JSON data source isnt as regular as I show above.

I believe I can clean the resulting data frame with codesubsetdf, a  foocode. Ill end up with some empty columns that way, but it wont matter to my program.p  pIt would be better if the solution provides a way to select which JSON source rows go into the data frame and which get rejected, so the result has only the columns and rows actually required.p

See demo a hrefhttpd2o0t5hpnwv4c1.cloudfront.net011jQuerySitesampleindex.html relnofollowhttpd2o0t5hpnwv4c1.cloudfront.net011jQuerySitesampleindex.htmlap  pNow, on some of the navs anchors, Id like for this plugin to NOT fire off as I want to be able to associate some of the navmenus anchors strictly with the ScrollTo plugin instead. p  pMy question is, what can I add to thisp  precodedocument.readyfunction   var hash  window.location.hash.substr1 var href  nav li a.eachfunction     var href  this.attrhref     ifhashhref.substr0,href.length4         var toLoad  hash.php content         content.loadtoLoad                                                   nav li a.clickfunction      var toLoad  this.attrhref content     content.hide888,loadContent     load.remove     wrapper.appendltspan idloadgtLOADING...ltspangt     load.fadeIn888     window.location.hash  this.attrhref.substr0,this.attrhref.length4     function loadContent          content.loadtoLoad,,showNewContent          function showNewContent          content.show888,hideLoader          function hideLoader          load.fadeOut888          return false     codepre  p...so that it doesnt fire off all the above whenever the anchor has the classscroll associated with it p
Negative 27080 pMaybe my title can be misleading, but let me clarify my questionp  pHeres a listp  precodechr1100200 100 100 chr1350500 150 250 chr1780880 100 350 chr1900950 50  400 codepre  pSo basically the first column is coordinate range, second column is the interval length substraction between the two coordinates from the first column, third column is the accumulation for the interval length.p  pNow I have a number, say 120. What I need to do is since 100 lt 120 lt 250 to compare my object with the key, and the key should point to the value chr1350500 similarly, if my number is 360, since 350 lt 360 lt 400, the value should be chr1900950p  pHopefully Ive made it clear. I guess I should use dictionary or hashtable to solve the problem, but here involves compare my object with keys and I dont know how to do it.p  pMany thanksp
Negative 27080 pIm trying to implement user login part of my website. I thought it would be much easier just to use a library rather than write a 1000 lines of code to reinvent the wheel. So Im just trying to get stackoverflows opinion, what is the best php user login authentication library out there. Ive been looking around usercake, kohana but a lot of them look like a highschool project by someone rather than a fully supported and developed library. Also, they seem to be using the deprecated mysql injections and I want to use PDO.p

Negative 27080 pI am trying to use Akka to implement the following I think Im trying to use Akka the proper wayp  pI have a system where I have emnem resource listeners.  Essentially a resource listener is an entity that will listen on an input resource and publish what it sees i.e. polling a database, tailing a log file, etc..p  pSo I want to use Akka actors to do these little bits of work units listening on a resource.  Ive noticed that the Akka gives me a thread pool of emtem threads which may be less than the number of listeners.  Unfortunately for me, getting a message from these resource listeners might be blocking, so it could take seconds, minutes, before the next message pops up.p  pIs there any way to suspend a resource listener so it leaves the thread to another actor and well come back to it a little later in timep
Negative 27080 pOur idea is to develop two versions of mobile app using titanium for android app and mobile website using phonegapjquery mobile UI at the same time.p  pLets say we design our web UI using jquery mobile UI and our app uses same web UI  for the app using webview component. Is it possible to access data of local sql light db in this kind of app which uses web view for rendering.p  pWe also evaluated Titanium Studio but with Jquery Mobile drag n drop , UI development is bit faster. So idea is , keep app size as minimum using jquery mobile UI as possible and loadsave data to sql light db as user uses the app.p  pGoing by titanium for web based app development, Would it be easier than jquery mobile UI  p  pCan you please provide your views about this approach and solution to this problem  We would also love to hear suggestions of experts before proceeding.p

Inside second activity only marked items are shown Ive got two listviews and Im passing an array which contains numbers of items that are marked. And heres the problem, lets say I have marked 2 items in my First activity, Im going to the Second and everything works fine, but when I go back and mark 2 new items, nothing happens in my second activity. I know why, Im making my items inside oncreate method and when Im in First activity my second goes onPause.  strongSo I thought to finish that activity, but heres the problemstrong When I write something likep  precode    Override protected void onPause      Second.this.finish     super.onPause  codepre  pIt shuts down whole app, how to finish only the second activity so it could call oncreate method each time its open again  Thanks for helpp

Negative 27080 pIn XCode, I created a xib file with several image view, some stacked on others. The entire view has a single view controller that has a connection to every image view. I guess my first question is, are all the image views direct subviews of the entire view Anyways, when ever the over all image view is touched, I detect it with touches began  touches moved. It works perfectly. However, there is one image view in particular that I want to know if it is being touched. How can I, from the master views touches began  touches moved, find out if a sub view within it was touched I want to do it this way because everything else I tried did not work. For the sub view, i created a view controller and set its view to the sub view in question. I set up the touches began  touches moved methods inside the controller, but they do not react to touches at all.p

Negative 27080 pClarificationp  pWhat Im trying to achieve is this the swiping gestures up, down, right and left are on a WebView. When any of the gestures occur this is what it needs to happen as soon as the swipe begins, an action must begin the action is actually loading a html link which moves an ip camera to either up,down,right,left. The html link makes the camera to go all the way to the right or left or up or down. I have another html link which when loaded will tell the ip camera to stop. p  pSo what it needs to happen is when the state is UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan the link load and moves the camera continuously until the user isnt touching the screen and the state becomes UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded and triggers the other html link to run in WebView which link will stop the camera from moving. As we speak my initial code posted does that but the swiping was too sensitive. This problem is fixed with your code but now the second link loads instantly after the first one, not allowing the camera to move. Does it make sense First link needs to run until the finger is lifted.p  hr  pOriginal questionp  pI was trying to determine the swipe direction using velocity in a UIPanGestureRecognizer, which I managed and it detects the right, left, up and down swipes, it triggers the appropriate actions based on the swipe direction and again the correct actions when UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded for each swipe, BUT, my problem in the code below is that the direction is very sensitive for example during a swipe to the right it recognises most part of the swipe as to the right but also some swipe up or down in between. As the swipe is not always perfectly in a straight line, what I would like to find is to only trigger the action for swipe right if the swipe is MOSTLY to the right and ignore the tiny pixel deviations. p  pAlso, ideally for my project is to trigger the action on a given swipe direction only once just like in the UISwipeGestureRecognizer, but using it I have a problem with UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded as it doesnt let the swipe action run until I lift my finger off the screen, it finishes the swipe action right away even though my finger is still swiping.p  pAny help would be much appreciated. Here is my codep  pin ViewDidLoad I havep  precodeUIPanGestureRecognizer gestureRecognizer  [[UIPanGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTargetself actionselectorhandleGesture] [myWebView addGestureRecognizergestureRecognizer] [gestureRecognizer setMinimumNumberOfTouches1] [gestureRecognizer setMaximumNumberOfTouches1] codepre  pand in my class I havep  precode voidhandleGestureUIPanGestureRecognizer gestureRecognizer  CGPoint velocity  [gestureRecognizer velocityInViewmyWebView]  ifvelocity.x gt 0right     my action here    if  [gestureRecognizer state]  UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded     my action when swipe finished here   else ifvelocity.x lt 0left     my action here    if  [gestureRecognizer state]  UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded     my action when swipe finished here   else ifvelocity.y gt 0down     my action here    if  [gestureRecognizer state]  UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded     my action when swipe finished here   else ifvelocity.y lt 0up     my action here    if  [gestureRecognizer state]  UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded     my action when swipe finished here   codepre  pThank you, any clarifications please ask.p

Negative 27080 pIm working with a web where many queries have to be performed to a MYSQL database. I use JavaTomcat as development environment. p  pI have tried different ways to solve thisp  ul lipAt the beginning I started using jstl with the sql tag. Every jsp document created this way seems dirty with many sql queries using the jstl sql tag and you have to change every document when the DB changes.pli lipThe second solution I tried was using lists and maps in servlets to access the data from jstl el. It looks fine but seems a bit strange at least for me to have to access each document with a custom url firstly you manipulate the data with several classes until you set the request attributes and call the jsp document RequestDispatcher and sometimes it could fail missing queries needed to fill some menus or tables if user jumps from here to there in the navigation sequence.pli lipThe final solution Im trying now is sending and receiving JSON data tofrom serverside. I like it everything happens in the same url context, the html document part is clean, more dynamic web... but JSON data have to be processed with javascript in clientside, which could affect the performance for large data chunks, and maybe have some size limitations due to the string format. For example JSON works fine for data splitting using DataTables js library where I only get a max I set this parameter of 200 rows at the same time from a DB. But it slows the web when I dont perform this data splitting and show, for example, a multiple combobox or a table with all the rows inside a table in the MYSQL DB.pli ul  pSome years ago I developed a desktop app C with embedded flash for navigation and xml for data exchange between DB and APP. But I think XML is better for data exporting among different apps, I dont need more files with partial data if I already have a DB. p  pSo, guys, what do you think is the best solution I would like to check different points of view.p

Negative 27080 pI am trying to have a service running on a Windows Server 2008 R2 be able to execute dcpromo in order to join and remove AD. In Server 2003, I was able to simply use Process.Start and provide the path to dcpromo and the path to the answer file provided by a user.p  pHowever, in Server 2008, this returns FileNotFoundException. I have verified the path to dcpromo, and have even tried running other executables in the System32 folder like ipconfig and whoami.p  pThe service is running as Local System account and the only way I have found to get it to work is save the command to a batch file and impersonate an Administrator to execute the batch file. But this has its own issue like requiring an Administrators password.p  pAccording to the permissions on the file, the SYSTEM account has readexecute permissions, and I have tried giving full permissions and changed the owner to SYSTEM, but none of this helped. The same code works if ran by a user as a regular application i.e. not a service.p  pAny idea how to grant SYSTEM account permissions to execute dcpromo while running under a service in Server 2008 R2p

Negative 27080 pSo Ive got a backend using CodeIgniter, with its native ActiveRecord for managing my basic data objects. The ActiveRecord class adds a few fields to help it figure out how to associate the objects ie. classname, table, columns. When I send these objects to the front end, these fields are included. I didnt want this so I created a sanitizing function which unsets them before theyre sent to the front end. p  pNow when Im in the frontend, and angular is managing all my resources, and I go and call save on a resource, it sends the json object to the backend. Then in the backend I turn this json into an object withp  precodeblob  unserializesprintf    Odss,     strlenBlob,     Blob,     strstrstrstrserializeblob, ,  codepre  pThis turns the json object into a Blob class, which extends ActiveRecord. Now the problem is, since I stripped out the ActiveRecord helper properties before I sent the object to the frontend... when I go to update on the backend, it obviously cant save it properly because of the lack of these properties.p  pSo my question is... is there something that exists which can help with this process My basic goal is to send the minimum Blob class to the front end sans the ActiveRecord properties, and then somehow do some backend magic upon saving to reassociate the barebones Blob class back into its ActiveRecord version so that it can save itself. I wouldnt mind researching new ORM libraries...p  pThanks Ryanp

Negative 27080 pI am using the multiprocessing package for python to launch different processes that do some work. This work is performed after reading huge files. Those files must be loaded by each process, so, there are many processes trying to get different huge files from the same hard drive at the same time, which saturates the reading buffer. It gives me a very slow performance. My question is Is there any way to tell Python does not try to open a file until the reading buffer is below a certain value Or which is the strategy to follow when you want to perform a multiprocessing work by accessing huge files from the same hard drivebr Thanks, Alejandrop

Negative 27080 pI am new here. I am a beginner in Qt but i am an intermediate level programmer in c. I had written a program previously in C and STLNo code is platform dependent and whole program is broken into around ten .cpp.h files.

The program is pretty lengthy. So it will be very hard to rewrite everything. Gui is not mandatory for me but I thought it would be good for presentation.It is for my Project so please reply soon.Please give me some examples or sites to refer to if possible.

The app is full of objects that are creates in a separate NSObject class. Think of it this way for examples sake I have my main viewController class. And in appDelegate I defineencode an array of objects. Now in my main, I fill the array with 10 cars. My car class has variables such as color, make, model, etc.. Now when I save and relaunch the app, the array that I have saved is now an array containing 10 elements, but it seems to have forgotten all of the variables for each instance of the car class. p  pWhen I relaunch the app, If I call NSLog,array in appDelegate It prints 10 lines that look a lot like this  So I know the array is being stored with 10 elements, and 10 elements are saved, but like i said, all of the variables are gone. p  pNote On the first run of the app, and the array is being filled for the first time, I can access all the variables perfectly, and nothing is wrong.p  pThank you for any help that I can getp

Negative 27080 pUsing libclang, I have a cursor into a AST, which corresponds to the statement resulting from a macro expansion.  I want to retrieve the original, unexpanded macro text.p  pIve looked for a libclang API to do this, and cant find one.  Am I missing somethingp  pAssuming such an API doesnt exist, I see a couple of ways to go about doing this, both based on using clanggetCursorExtent to obtain the source range of the cursor  which is, presumably, the range of the original text.p  pThe first idea is to use clanggetFileLocation to obtain the filename and position od the range start and end, and to read the text directly from the file.  If Ive compiled from unsaved files then i need to deal with that, but my main concern with this approach is that it just doesnt seem right to be going outside to the filesystem when Im sure clang holds all this information internally.  There also would be implications if the AST has been loaded rather than generated, or if the source files have been modified since they were parsed.p  pThe second approach is to call clangtokenize on the cursor extent.  I tried doing this, and found that it fails to produce a token list for most of the cursors in the AST.  Tracing into the code, it turns out that internally clangtokenize manipulates the supplied range and ends up concluding that it spans multiple files presumably due to some effect of the macro expansion, and aborts.  This seems incorrect to me, but I do feel that in any case Im abusing clangtokenize trying to do this.p  pSo, whats the best approachp

Negative 27080 pI have a problem in running puppet agent in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4 and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11.

Negative 27080 pIm working on a wordpress project that involves getting 990 entries from a spreadsheet into the system. Ive been able to create CSV files to create the posts, as well as their associations with a handful of custom taxonomies. Now however I have to figure out this media thing.p  p990 posts, almost all of which need to have an image and a video file associated with them.p  pIve tried a plugin for importing csv data into the database, and in wppostmeta creating entries with the associated Post ID, a meta key of wpattachedfile, and the file name. I also added entries for each image into the posts table, including what SHOULD be the right guid, postparent, and postmimetype.p  pThe theme I have in place can pull the data as it needs to and display as it should, but behind the scenes is where the problem lies. I go to edit a post and unless its one where I manually added the media through editing the post itself, no image shows up. Theres SOME association I must be missing in the database somewhere, but I havent been able to track it down yet. There has to be a way to handle this through SQL, as opposed to manually editing every entry. p  pIm looking at wpattachmentmetadata, and Im wondering if thats the key Are the entries in wppostmeta and wpposts really essentially pointless, and its all on wpattachmentmetadata Id hate to set out on hacking together 990 video too, so 1980 serialized entries only to find out thats still not the missing link.  p  pI have the images in wpposts with the proper parent, and in postmeta with the right information. Something is still missing though...p

The worlds No. 1 maker of chips will introduce a number of new microprocessors that will belong to Core i3 and Pentium product families.  In case the document is up to date and plans of Intels are not going to change, then on September 1, 2013, the worlds largest chipmaker will introduce Core i74771, Core i54440, Core i54440S, Core i34340, Core i34330, Core i34330T, Core i34130, Core i34130T, Pentium G3430, Pentium G3420, Pentium G3220, Pentium G3420T as well as Pentium G3220T based on Haswell microarchitecture. The company will also add new Core i53340, Core i53340S, Celeron G1630, Celeron G1620 and Celeron G1620T based on Ivy Bridge microarchitecture.  It is interesting to note that the aforementioned microprocessors will be announced on September 1, but will only become available on Asian markets starting that date. In Europe, MiddleEast, Africa, North America and Latin America the new chips will be available only starting from September 29, 2013.    The emergence of new affordable microprocessors based on Intel Haswell microarchitecture will mark the beginning of the end of previousgeneration products, including those based on Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge designs. As Intel widens availability of newgeneration microprocessors, it will have to shrink shipments of earlier central processing units.  Intel did not comment on the newsstory. ltdivgt codepre

Negative 27080 pHi Im a Drupal newbie and am really struggling with best practices for this CMS. Right now I am trying to use the Panels 3 Module to create the pages of my website with custom layouts that I have created. What I cant seem to wrap my head around is the ridiculous amount of excessive markup thats coming from panels as well as each individual template in the drupal install node.tpl, field functions, region.tpl etc etc. I have some very elaborate website designs that I need to create and the html that is being generated from the Drupal templates and field functions is literally making my job impossible. I am used to wordpress where I can simply make a database query examplewpquery, grab the values that I need and display them in any markup that I want. What am I missing here in Drupal Am I really supposed to overwrite 7 template files all the way down to the field level in Drupal to get some clean markup What am I missing herep

The init and repr still had to be redefined.pli lipIt probably has something to do with the usergroups table, because I even couldnt join it with the groups or users table. And it always says, that the class object has no attribute userid.

Negative 27080 pIm trying to create a circular shadow underneath a sprite image in my game. However, for some reason, even though I create the circle first, the sprite always appears underneath it. Here is the codep  precodelocal circle  display.newCircle100,100,30 circlesetFillColor0,0,0 local hunter  display.newSpriteimageSheet,createAnimationSequenceHunter,5 codepre  pthe createAnimationSequence function just organizes the animation sequences, so this cannot be the problem. Ive tried putting both the sprite and the circle in its own display group, and even that did not work. Im very confused by this issue, but it could just be a careless error I am not seeing.p  pThe circle appears and so does the sprite, only the circle is on top of the sprite instead of underneath it, even though I code for it to be drawn first.p

Negative 27080 pIm thinking about using an embedded db4o database for storing calculation results of a simulation tool. The simulation results can be quite large up to some GBs for a single run, so the practical size of the database might probably be in the range from 10 GB to 100 GB. p  pAs far as Ive understood, db4o stores the whole database in a single file. While Ive understood that db4o supports databases a hrefhttpcommunity.versant.comdocumentationreferencedb4o8.0javareferenceContenttroubleshootincreasingthemaximumdatabasefilesize.htm relnofollowup to 254 GBa, Im still worrying that I might run into problems with file systems that dislike large files The application Im working on will run on a big variety of architectures, so I cannot really predict which file systems will be in place.... So, is there any best practice that helps me avoiding huge files while still keeping the benefits of an embedded databasep  pEdit I just found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2502742hasanyoneusedanobjectdatabasewithalargeamountofdatathisa post dealing with really large amounts of data in db4o in general.

Negative 27080 pSo I was what the best way for all views in an application to have actions performed on an element. p  pIn a non single page application you would run sayp  precodedocument.readyfunction       .autosize.autosize  codepre  pto apply autosize function to all elements with the autosize class on every page. p  pNow in a Backbone Marionette app to do this you could perform that in each view with codeonDomRefreshcode or similar but for things that affect 90 of views youd want this to run automatically somehow.p  pI dont think theres a way that an Application object can listen to all codeonDomRefreshcode events which would potentially solve it. Ive consider overloading codeMarionette.MonitorDOMRefreshcodeto add this in but it doesnt feel like a Backbone approach. p  pOther things I considered were subclassing each of the marionette views to add mixins for loading different groups of UI elements.p  pI figured other people must have experienced this scenario so was interested what approaches have been used.p

Negative 27080 pI want to have a movieclip make a hole on another movieclip, like putting a window on a wall. I can make a mask that has the same effect as rightclicking a layer and masking it, but that is not what I want. I want to make a transparent hole.p  pI have tried something like thisp  precodemc1  new green  mc2  new blue   mc2.blendMode  BlendMode.ALPHA   addChildmc1  addChildmc2  mc2.cacheAsBitmap  true  mc1.mask  mc2  codepre  pAnd thisp  precodemc1.cacheAsBitmap  true  mc2.cacheAsBitmap  true  mc1.setMaskmc2 codepre  pFirst problem The code gives me errors. Second problem Doesnt make a hole on the movieclip, just does a normal mask.p

Negative 27080 pI have a folder with 20 some files and am wanting to sort them similar to the way Windows Explorer does. The files I have all have prefixes of block sizes like sop  precode1024KB.log 32KB.log 64KB.log 4KB.log 256KB.log 512KB.log codepre  pBut when I sort them in batch, it only looks at the first digit then sorts them like sop  precode1024KB.log 256KB.log 32KB.log 4KB.log 512KB.log 64KB.log codepre  pI want to sort them by smallest to largest block size. Any ideasp  pEDIT I also have to keep the file name integrity because I then call another script which uses the file names and creates strings.p
Negative 27080 pIn the storyboard I have a Navigation Controller in Relationship with a View Controller.p  pThe View Controller contains a MKMapView.p  pThe View Controller is also set, in Identity Inspector  Custom Class, to be a custom controller MapViewController.p  pThis is MapViewController.hp  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt import ltMapKitMapKit.hgt import ltCoreLocationCoreLocation.hgt import MarkerAnnotation.h import MarkerButton.h import MainMapView.h  interface MapViewController  UITableViewController ltMKMapViewDelegate, CLLocationManagerDelegategt  property weak, nonatomic IBOutlet MKMapView localMapView  end codepre  plocalMapView is linked to the MKMapView placed in the ViewController on the storyboard through Referencing Outlets, and Im using it already in the code on .m file for things like setting annotations or getting bounds.origin.p  pEvery time the user moves the map I need to run some lines to update the map. So, I tried to implement mapViewregionDidChangeAnimated on the .m file, but this is never called.p  precode voidmapViewMKMapView mapView regionDidChangeAnimatedBOOLanimated      NSLogRegion changed  codepre  pI tried creating a custom subclass of MKMapView implementing on that class the method, but wasnt called either. you can still see in the imports of .h file, MainMapView.h... I still havent deleted the importp  pIs there something Im missing Do I have to set some more connection between the map and the current classp  pOtherwise, is there another way I can trigger an event every time the map movesp

Negative 27080 pIm writing a program that applies many principles of computational linguistics. My problem at this moment is the following piece of code form a method that flexibilizes two definitions. This is, it compares two different definitions of the same word, and in each definition empty or blank spaces will be added to later on work with the altered definitions with blank spaces added.br Say we have the following two definitions, defining the term free fall.p  precode1 Free fall descent  of a body subjected only to            the   action of  gravity. 2 Free fall movement of a body in        a    gravitational field under  the influence of gravity codepre  pThere is a list of words called stoplist, which contains the words of, a, in, to, and under. After the process, each word in the definition that is also contained in the stoplist must correspond to a blank space OR another stoplist word of the other definition. So after executing such process, the previous definitions, represented in two different lists, should look like thisp  precode1 Free fall descent  of a body   subjected     only  to     the action    of gravity. 2 Free fall movement of a body in   a    gravitational field under  the influence of gravity. codepre  pThe code I wrote to achieve this is the followingp  hr  precode[...]  String[] sList  STOPLIST.split   this is the stoplist String[] definition1  defA1.split   this is the array of words of the first definition String[] definition2  defA2.split   this is the array of words of the second definition ListltStringgt def1  new ArrayListltStringgt   ListltStringgt def2  new ArrayListltStringgt ListltStringgt stopList  new ArrayListltStringgt  forString word  definition1     def1.addword I transform arrays into lists this way because I used to think that using .asList was the problem.  forString word  definition2     def2.addword  forString word  sList     stopList.addword   int mdef  def1.size lt def2.size  def1.size  def2.size here mdef will have the value of the lenght of the shortest definition, and we are going to use the value of mdef to iterate later on.  forint i  0 i lt mdef i     if stopList.containsdef1.geti   here I check if the first word of the first definition is also found in the stoplist.         if stopList.containsdef2.geti   If the word of def1 previously checked is in the stoplist, as well as the corresponding word in the second definition, then we wont add a  blank space in the corresponding position of the second definition.            def2.addi ,   here I add that blank space, only if the stoplist word in def1 corresponds to a nonstoplist word in def2. Again, we do this so the stoplist word in def1 corresponds to a blank space OR another stoplist word in def2.            ifmdef  def2.size                mdef In case the shortest definition is the definition to which we just added spaces, we increment mdef, because that space added increases the length of the shortest definition, and to iterate in this recenlty extended definiton, we have to increment the index with which we iterate.               else if stopList.containsdef2.geti  this else if does the same than the previous one, but checks for the second definition instead of the first one. And adds blanks to def1 instead of def2 if necessary.         if stopList.containsdef1.geti              def1.addi ,               ifmdef  def1.size                 mdef                 [...] codepre  hr  pNow, if you analyze the code carefully, you will realize that not all words of the lengthiest list will be checked, given that we iterate ove the definitions using the lenght of the shortest definition as index. This is fine, the remainding words of the lenghtiest definitions dont have to be checked, they will correspond to null spaces of the other definition in case the lists dont end up being of the same lenght after the addition of spaces, as the previous exaple shows.p  pNow, after the explanation, the problem is the following after running the main class, which calls the method that contains the previous code, a runtime exceptions pops outp  precodeException in thread main java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException Index 1, Size 0     at java.util.ArrayList.rangeCheckArrayList.java571     at java.util.ArrayList.getArrayList.java349     at main2.mainmain2.java75 codepre  pI dont understand why it is finding any of the lists as empty. I have tried to solve it in too many ways, I hope a I gave a good explanation.p  pIt may help as a clue that if I assign mdef to the lengthiest size instead of the shortest, that is p  precodeint mdef  def1.size gt def2.size  def1.size  def2.size codepre  pthe error changes to p  precodeException in thread main java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException Index 15, Size 15     at java.util.ArrayList.rangeCheckArrayList.java571     at java.util.ArrayList.getArrayList.java349     at asmethods.lcc.turnIntoFlexlcc.java55     at asmethods.lcc.calLcclcc.java99     at main2.mainmain2.java73  codepre  pWhere lcc is the class that contains the method turnIntoFlex that contains the piece of code Im showing. The line 55 of turnIntoFlex corresponds to the first line of the loop, that isp  precodeif stopList.containsdef1.geti  [...] codepre  pComments The values of defA1 and defA2 are the definitions, respectively. i.e. def1 and def2, initially, are lists in which each separate element is a word. I cant check if these lists are being populated by printing them because the indexoutofboundsexception pops at the very moment the loop starts. However, I do print the values of the sizes of mdef, def1.size and def2.size, and the values turn out to be 13, or 15, showing that no list is empty before the for loop starts.p  pThe mdef was something I added recently, not to exactly to solve this specific problem, but the error has been popping since before I added the mdef part. As I explained, The intention is to increase mdef when the shortest list is extended but only when the short list is extended so we iterate through all the words of the short list, and not more.p

Negative 27080 pI am doing a project for multiple platforms where I have followed best practices and created a core project to contain all the code that is the same on all platforms.  To do the network communication I would like to use HttpClient which seems to be the recommended approach for communicating with web services going forward.p  pI am NOT doing a PCL but just a standard C library to contain the core project. However it seems that there is no common implementation of HttpClient but only platform specific ones. I cannot reference and use it in my core but only in my Android and iOS projects.p  pI would very much prefer to have all networking code in my core project and as I see it there are two options  neither of which I like.p  ol liMake a common interface that I can use in the core project that is implemented as a wrapper on both Android and iOS.li liUse another technology that is supported in the core project  I am thinking webclient or the like.li ol  pWhat is the recommended approach and why hasnt Xamarin made HttpClient available as a common library p  pHope someone can help, Thanksp

Negative 27080 pI work on a crossplatform project, and recently added support for the Raspberry Pi.

Negative 27080 pIm having some trouble with iptables and a fresh set of eyeballs would probably be able to see where the problem lies.p  pIm trying to use the netfilter queue to mark packets via nfqsetverdictmark  old documentation says to use nfqsetverdict2 but that function seems to no longer be in the header or library in the PREROUTING chain of mangle table.  The packet then should move on to PREROUTING chain of nat table, where I have rules to read the mark and redirect accordingly.

The program is only writing the last word that is stored.p  pThe abridged main method code is as followsp  precode    get first line of text     line  bw.readLine      while string is not null     while line  null              System.out.println Processing...   display message to show work being done          tokenLine  lineTokenline    tokenize string          to prevent exception from no token found         while tokenLine.hasMoreTokens                      word  flipWordtokenLine     get next token and reverse letters             newLine  marginCheckword    store or write line depending on margin              flushClosenewLine    write and flush buffer then close file                    move to next line in file         line  bw.readLine           flushClosenewLine    write and flush buffer then close file      output completion message     System.out.printlnThe new file has been written. codepre  pThe relevant methods as followsp  ppublic static StringTokenizer lineTokenString line              local constantsp  precode    local variables     StringTokenizer tokenLine      store tokenized line       Start lineToken Method       tokenLine  new StringTokenizerline  tokenize the current line of text      return tokenLine  end lineToken codepre  ppublic static String flipWordStringTokenizer tokenLine              local constantsp  precode    local variables     String word        store word for manipulation     String revWord          store characters as they are flipped       Start flipWord Method     store the next token as a string     word  tokenLine.nextToken      for each character store that character to create a new word     for int count  word.length count gt 0 count              revWord  revWord  word.charAtcount  1 store the new word character by character      return revWord     return the word reversed  end flipWord codepre  ppublic static String marginCheckString revWord throws Exception              local constants         final int MARGIN  60  maximum characters per linep  precode    local variables     String newLine              store the new line     FileWriter fw      writes to output file     BufferedWriter bWriter     instantiate buffered writer object     PrintWriter pw     instantiate print writer object     String outFile    RevWord.text  file to write to       Start marginCheck Method      open the output file for writing       fw  new FileWriteroutFile     bWriter  new BufferedWriterfw     pw  new PrintWriterbWriter      if the buffered line concatenated with the word is less than the margins     if newLine.length  revWord.length lt MARGIN         newLine  newLine  revWord         the buffered line adds the word     else         put an enline character at the end and write the line         newLine  newLine  n         pw.printlnnewLine          use this word as the first word of the next line         newLine  revWord        return newLine     return for use with flush end marginCheck codepre  ppublic static void flushCloseString inLine throws Exception              local constantsp  precode    local variables     FileWriter fw      writes to output file     BufferedWriter bWriter     instantiate buffered writer object     String outFile    RevWord.text  file to write to       Start flushClose Method      fw  new FileWriteroutFile     bWriter  new BufferedWriterfw   initialize writer object      write the last line to the output file then flush and close the buffer     bWriter.write inLine     bWriter.flush     bWriter.close end flushClose codepre

Negative 27080 pI have a simple Activity containing a ViewPager, which displays Fragments.p  pMy Activity should display information about a football league, and each fragment displays information like livescroesmatchdays, tables, etc.p  pThe Intent with which I start the Activity, contains the league id.p  pAnd each Fragment needs this league id to load the correct data.p  pSo my FragmentPagerAdapter looks like thisp  precodepublic class LeaguePagerAdapter extends FragmentPagerAdapter       private String leagueId      public LeaguePagerAdapterFragmentManager fm, String leagueId          superfm         this.leagueId  leagueId           Override     public Fragment getItemint pos          if pos  0             return TableFragment.newInstanceleagueId          else                       return MatchdayFragment.newInstanceleagueId                codepre  pThe TableFragment looks like this  the matchday fragment looks similarp  precodepublic class TableFragment extends PullToRefreshListViewAdFragment       private String leagueId      public static TableFragment newInstanceString leagueId          TableFragment t  new TableFragment         t.leagueId  leagueId         return t           Override     public View onCreateViewLayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,         Bundle savedInstanceState                 Setup UI and load data           codepre  pSometimes the leagueId is null. I see the exceptions in the crash logs crittercism. But Im asking my self why. It seems to me, that the problem is when the activity has been destroyed in the background and reconstructed if for instance the user uses the multitasking button to switch to my app.p  pSo as far as I know, the original Intent will be stored internally by Android itself if the Activity has been destoryed. Therefore I have not implemented any onSaveInstanceState in my activity nor in the fragment. In my activity I read the Intent Extra to retrieve the leagueId. This works fine, also on restoring the activity. I have assumed that by recreating the activity, a new LeaguePagerAdapter will be created and all fragments will also be new created.p  pIs that correct Or does the old fragment instance will be restored and hence the leagueId is null because the fragment has not stored the leagueId in Fragments onSaveInstanceState method.p  pIs there a way to test such lifecycle thingsp
Negative 27080 pIm creating a header intended for mobile navigation. I decided to use a table, as this site has a responsive layout, and the last item in the table needs to have a dynamic width and a table worked splendid for this.p  pHowever I have run into one last issue. For the first home button in the table 60x60, if I insert a 60x60 image into it, the height of the table increases from its set value of 60px, to something around 6566px.

The second you give it a valid image with a height of 60px, the table height expands.p  pAny ideas Ive read some things about tables possibly handling images oddly. Are there any workarounds Any ways that I can force the table height to remain at 60px Ive tried embedding a block div in the cell that contained the image, and I tried changing the img properties in CSS to displayblock with no dice.

Negative 27080 pToday I ran across the concept of a C Interface, I have one hopefully simple question to see if I understand them...

Negative 27080 pI have a .NET 4.5.1 WCF service that handles synchronization from an app that will be used by thousands of users.  I currently use Task.WaitAll as shown below and it works fine but I read that this is bad, can cause deadlocks, etc.  I believe I tried WhenAll in the past and it didnt work, I dont recall the issues as Im returning to this for review again just to make sure Im doing this right.  My concern is whether or not the blocking is needed and preferred in this use, a WCF service method hence why the WaitAll appears to work without issue.p  pI have about a dozen methods that each update an entity in Entity Framework 6 processing the incoming data with existing data and making the necessary changes.  Each of these methods can be expensive so I would like to use parallelism mainly to get all methods working at the same time on this powerful 24 core server.  Each method returns as Task as wraps its contents in Task.Run.  The DoSync method created a new List and adds each of these sync methods to the list.  I then call Task.WaitAlltaskList.ToArray and all works great.p  pIs this the right way of doing this  I want to make sure this method will scale well, not cause problems, and work properly in a WCF service scenario.p

Negative 27080 pThink of several runners on a marathon. The athletes are all wearing GPS devices. The track itself has no sensors, and I need to know when each athlete crosses a predetermined set of GPS coordinates. However, each athlete may cross the waypoint at a slightly different latlong, since the trackroad might be wide enough that different parts of the trackroad are used.p  pWhat is the best way to determine whether an athlete has passed a waypointp  pIm using Python, and am open to using an external library. Im working with preprocessed GPS data, so I have only the latitude and longitude at each time point and a few other bits and pieces like speed and distance travelled.p

Before, I was using the first Scanner instance in the function to get the input for the number of thorns. However, it wouldnt work properly. The old function looked like thisp  precodepublic static void addFlower         Scanner input  new ScannerSystem.in         System.out.printlnWhat is the flowers name         String desiredName  input.nextLine         System.out.printlnWhat is the flowers color         String desiredColor  input.nextLine         System.out.printlnHow many thorns does it have         int desiredThorns  input.nextInt         System.out.printlnWhat does it smell like         String desiredSmell  input.nextLine         flowerPack.addnew FlowerClassdesiredName, desiredColor, desiredThorns, desiredSmell      codepre  pIs there a reason why the first version of the function didnt work I managed to fix it by using a new Scanner but I dont understand why the first version didnt work. Does the Scanner get confused when you try to use a single scanner for different kinds of input Im looking at the Scanning tutorial from The Java Tutorials docs and I dont see the answer.

Negative 27080 pIn Java you could call methods to help you do some heavy lifting in the constructor, but javascript requires the method to be defined first, so Im wondering if theres another way I could go about this or if Im forced to call the method that does the heavy lifting after its been defined.

Negative 27080 pI am using AngularJS to power my webapp. Recently Ive decided to introduce Stomp over websockets in the mix with RabbitMQ. One problem that I keep hitting is that sometimes the messages sent from the backend are at so high frequency that Angular fails to trigger some events losing data in the process. p  pThe application is rather complex so sometimes a message might pass through the following chainp  ol liStompJS Angular service wrapper. Uses rootScope.broadcast to notify components when new messages have arrivedli liController that registers to messages that are being broadcast on rootScope. Controller then updates bindings or sends another event to a component to perform some data updates.li ol  pAs I mentioned strongsometimesstrong the scopes dont get updated properly, even though the events are being sent and the values are being populated the view does not show the updated values. I have used scope.apply, timeout, scope.digest and nothing seems to work... For example if I have 2 packets coming one after another and theres little or no delay between them on the socket nothing happens but if theres one the same piece of code functions properly. How to overcome this p  pTo further exemplify after some questions posted by the users p  pI will take the most simple example i get progress reports from a job that runs on the backend. Basically it tells me how many rows have been written in a Cassandra database. So I get notifications like wrote 8000, total 4000000. wrote is being increased as the workers write in the database and since there are multiple workers sometimes these notifications get pushed very fast. I have a custom grid component written that listens for events like gridupdateCell which allows me to update a cell with the progress report. Every time a packet comes on the socket I broadcast that event scope.broadcast because the grid it is a child of page the controller. I have noticed that not all the updates from the socket get reflected in the UI although the event is caught and the grid event is also triggered with successful update of the data model but the not the UIp

Negative 27080 pIm working on a site for a corporation that uses their own customized, lockeddown version of IE8 including Developer Tools being switched off, yay. I recently added webfonts to the site. These render as expected even under the corporations own IE8 when viewed as static pages stored locally on one of their computers, but they do not render at all when served from a running system accessed over a network.p  pI expected that the problem was due to IE8s default setting of displaying intranet sites in compatibility mode. Sure enough, as long as the site is included in this zone, webfonts do not render correctly. If I add the site to the Trusted zone, the webfonts appear as expected.p  pThe catch is, Display intranet sites in compatibility mode is actually switched off, so the zone shouldnt make a difference as far as compatibility mode goes. I dont think the corporations admins are overriding this setting, because the registry keys for IntranetCompatibilityMode and AllSitesCompatibilityMode which I can view but not edit are both set to 0. Additionally, we are explicitly requesting standards mode by setting the HTML5 doctype and setting both the response header and the meta tag for XUACompatible to IEedge. p  pBecause I dont have the IE Developer Tools available, I cannot verify for certain that the reason the webfonts are not displaying while in the intranet zone is because the page is being rendered in compatibility mode. So my questions arep  ul liCould there be any other reason why the page renders differently between the Intranet and Trusted zones For example, could it be the difference between document mode and browser mode as asked here but not yet answered a hrefhttpsstackoverflow.comquestions15800605ie8renderswebpagedifferentlybasedonbrowsermodeeventhoughdocumentmodeIE8 renders web page differently based on browser mode even though document mode is fixed  Intranet sitea li liIf compatibility mode is indeed the reason for the discrepancy, what else do I need to do to force standards mode instead Ideally this would work even with Display intranet sites in compatibility mode checked.li ul

Negative 27080 pI would like to run several tasks in parallel until a certain amount of time has passed. Let us suppose those threads are CPUheavy andor may block indefinitely. After the timeout, the threads should be interrupted immediately, and the main thread should continue execution regardless of unfinished or still running tasks.p  pIve seen a lot of questions asking this, and the answers were always similar, often along the lines of create thread pool for tasks, start it, join it on timeoutp  pThe problem is between the start and join parts. As soon as the pool is allowed to run, it may grab CPU and the timeout will not even start until I get it back.p  pI have tried Executor.invokeAll, and found that it did not fully meet the requirements. Examplep  precode    long dt  System.nanoTime      ExecutorService pool  Executors.newFixedThreadPool 4     List ltCallable ltStringgtgt list  new ArrayList ltgt      for int i  0 i lt 10 i          list.add new Callable ltStringgt               Override             public String call  throws Exception                  while true                                                  System.out.println Start at   System.nanoTime   dt  1000000  ms     try          pool.invokeAll list, 3000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS          catch InterruptedException e           System.out.println End at   System.nanoTime   dt  1000000  ms codepre  blockquote   pStart at 1msbr   End at 3028msp blockquote  pThis 27 ms delay  may not seem too bad, but an infinite loop is rather easy to break out of  the actual program experiences ten times more easily. My expectation is that a timeout request is met with very high accuracy even under heavy load Im thinking along the lines of a hardware interrupt, which should emalwaysem work.p  pThis is a major pain in my particular program, as it needs to heed certain timeouts rather accurately for instance, around 100 ms, if possible better. However, starting the pool often takes as long as 400 ms until I get control back, pushing past the deadline.p  pIm a bit confused why this problem is almost never mentioned. Most of the answers I have seen definitely suffer from this. I suppose it may be acceptable usually, but in my case its not.p  pIs there a clean and tested way to go ahead with this issuep  pstrongEdited to addstrongp  pMy program is involved with GC, even though not on a large scale. For testing purposes, I rewrote the above example and found that the results given are very inconsistent, but on average noticeably worse than before.p  precode    long dt  System.nanoTime      ExecutorService pool  Executors.newFixedThreadPool 40     List ltCallable ltStringgtgt list  new ArrayList ltgt      for int i  0 i lt 10 i          list.add new Callable ltStringgt               Override             public String call  throws Exception                  String s                   while true                      s  Long.toString System.nanoTime                      if s.length  gt 1000000                          s                                                                        System.out.println Start at   System.nanoTime   dt  1000000  ms     try          pool.invokeAll list, 1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS          catch InterruptedException e           System.out.println End at   System.nanoTime   dt  1000000  ms codepre  blockquote   pStart at 1msbr   End at 1189msp blockquote

Currently my sendto function looks like p  precode        sendtosd,message,80,0,struct sockadd  ampserver,serverlength codepre  pI know this line works as the packet makes it through it just does not appear as I would like it to. In the send to, message is the formatted string I am trying to create to properly send all of contents of the array. Currently is is arbitrary and has little significance I have it in for debugging purposes essentially. p

Negative 27080 pI am working in Python and using the cut functionality in Pandas.

In other words, I would like to predefine codebinscode as code[0, 100000]code and then append user defined integers to this set of numbers. If the user entered code5, 100, 5000code then codebinscode would become code[0, 5, 100, 5000, 100000]code and would then work with codepd.cutdf[Quantity], binscode.p  pI have tried a number of solutions with no avail up to this point  any input would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 27080 pOpenGL pixelsfragments are conceptually 1x1 squares centered on halfinteger pixels. The OpenGL 4.5 specification statesp  blockquote   pA fragment is located by its lower left corner, which lies on integer   grid coordinates. Rasterization operations also refer to a fragments   center, which is offset by 12,12 from its lower left corner and   so lies on halfinteger coordinates.p blockquote  pRasterizers typically assume that pixel centers lie on the integer grid. Since I am attempting to implement a correct OpenGL triangle fill I want to know if the following procedures seems sound.p  pLets take the simple case of a triangle with clip coordinates 1,1, 1,1, 0,1 as shown on the left of the figure below assume orthographic projection and z0. Assume we have a small 5x5 frame buffer that we map our triangle to via codeglViewport0,0,5,5code as shown on the right yielding the triangle in device coordinates with vertices 0,0, 5,0, 2.5,5.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjWcL8.png altpixels centered at half integersp  pAs you can see, the 13 fragments shaded pixels in image with centers inside the triangle should be generated by the rasterizer. Note that the fragment centers are on halfinteger coordinates. To implement the OpenGL spec, this is what the result needs to be.p  pA scanline polygon fill would determine the xspans where the scan lines intersect the triangle, but the scan lines are at halfinteger yvalues as shown in the following figurep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comn5VLe.png alttriangle fill OpenGLp  pA hardwarefirmware rasterizer will assume the pixel centers are on the integer grid since this is the most efficient way to perform the fill. In the figure below I have shifted the devices coordinates of the triangle by 0.5, 0.5 to place the centers on the integer gridp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHLyKU.png altenter image description herep  pNote that the pixels centers are now indeed on the integer grid. This rasterizer would simply add back 0.5,0.5 to each fragment center before being passed to the fragment shader. At least that is my plan.p  pHandling texture coordinates seems to be straightforward. Imagine the I assigned texture coordinates 0,0, 1,0, 0.5,1 as shown below. The image on the left is using halfinteger pixelcenters the OpenGL way and the image on the right is using integer pixel centers the hardware way. The texture coordinates any attached fragment attributes for that matter end up having the same values either way  i.e., nothing special needs to be done.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUzpcW.png altenter image description herep  pSo does my approach seem correct p  ul liAdd 0.5,0.5 to each fragment coordinate, li liuse the hardware efficient fill, li liadd 0.5, 0.5 back in when generating fragment centers, and li lidont sweat the other fragment attributes they just work out.li ul
Negative 27080 pI have two string lists, one with humanIds that fulfill some conditions humanosPosibles, and another list that contain humanIds that may or may not fulfill the conditions likesTodo.The thing is, I need to create one list that contains only the humansIds that are in likesTodo and also in humanosPosibles.  I tried doing it with recursion and a list.filter. Ill put my code for you to see what is it that I am doing wrong.

Negative 27080 pI would like to know how is it supposed to do the following in mercurial.p  pMy repository is on our server where mercurialserver is running. I develop on Windows and because my project is supposed to be multiplatform, Ive set up Jenkins build server which builds using a Linux slave machine automatically after each push.p  pNow what I needbr Quite often the build on Linux does not work, because Im using treat warnings as errors and gcc gives different warnings than MSVC. Then I need to fix the build and I dont want to mess the repository with fixing commits often more commits are needed to fix all gcc warnings. It would be ok for me to have a single commit in the repo for a fix of the linux build.p  pI thought I could just clone the repository to a fixing repo like a branch using clone and do as many fixing commits as needed. Then just merge all these commits to the main repo as a single fixing commit. But then I need to make my fixing repo public i.e. clone the fixing repo to the remote server to allow jenkins to build the sources. But how to get rid of the fixing repo when the fix is finished It is probably not a good idea to allow users delete remote repositories, is itp  pPossibilities I seebr 1 forgot about branching using clone, do a named branch, fix, merge to master branch and close the fixing branch  strongprobably not a common solution in mercurial to create a named branch for thisstrongbr 2 just create a new head possibly set a bookmark, fix, merge to master head branch and close the fixing head can I close a head  strongbetter but I still have to do with all fixing commits in the main repositorystrongbr 3 using the cloned fixing repo, set up ssh access or even mercurialserver for Jenkins to my personal machine and let it clone from it, build and when the build is fixed, just merge all commit from local fixing repo to remote repository as a single commitp  pSome better solution Or do I want to do something unusualbr Thanks.p

Negative 27080 pI built a maven plugin and I modify its classloader in order to be able to take resources and create objects of classes of the module I am executing the plugin on. So everything works fine when I execute the plugin on one module, but the problems come when I execute it on several child modules when I run the build of the root project. So the first execution is fine, but when it proceeds to the second module it seems to have kept the ClassLoader modifications of the first execution and as I have 2 files with the same name in the 2 modules and I took them as a resource from the ClassLoader it always loads the first fileas it is added first. This makes me think that the execution of the plugin is in one process with one ClassLoader. So what I thought is that I have to somehow reset the ClassLoader on every execution. So what I tried is the followingp  precodeThread.currentThread.setContextClassLoadernew URLClassLoadernew URL[0], null codepre  pThis is because I saw that it should use a bootstrapped ClassLoader when you set it to null. But unfortunately it didnt work. So has anybody any idea how to reset the ClassLoaderp

But my question is how will thread2 then know to go back up and complete codemethodAcode, instead of just continuing with the codeforcode loopp  pI know this is the case because codelist1code and codelist2code both have 2000 codeIntegerscode in them at the end, meaning that both threads successfully completed the codeforcode loop in codeprocesscode 1000 times each, and called both methods each time.p  pMy only guess would be that when a thread encounters a synchronized block that is locked, it stores that block in a queue or its stack and moves on, until the block is free again. p

Sometimes they are inline with the codeCREATE TABLEcode statement, and sometimes they are standalone codeALTER TABLEcode statements.

Negative 27080 pI would like to be able to apply a single FieldLayout to multiple grids, which are dynamically created at runtime.p  pIn my application, I use a search bar to type in a Type name, and when a Type is found a grid will render displaying all instances of that type on the server. The user should then be able to search for a different Type and thus replace the grid with a new one.p  pI am setting AutoGenerateFields in the FieldLayoutSettings to true since I do not know about the types I will be displaying until run time and the fields will differ across types. I do know, however, that they will share some fields that I do not wish to display on the grid as they all extend the same abstract class. Therefore I am using a FieldLayout as followsp  precode    ltigDPXamDataGrid xNameMyGrid DataSourceBinding Items gt         ltigDPXamDataGrid.FieldLayoutSettingsgt             ltigDPFieldLayoutSettings AutoGenerateFieldsTruegt         ltigDPXamDataGrid.FieldLayoutSettingsgt         ltigDPXamDataGrid.FieldLayoutsgt             ltigDPFieldLayout IsDefaultTruegt                 ltigDPField NamePropertyToNotDisplay VisibilityCollapsedgt                 ltigDPField NameAnotherPropertyToNotDisplay VisibilityCollapsedgt             ltigDPFieldLayoutgt         ltigDPXamDataGrid.FieldLayoutsgt     ltigDPXamDataGridgt codepre  pWhen I type in my first Type name and render the grid this FieldLayout is used as expected all is well. However, the next time I type in a type name and render the grid, no FieldLayout is applied at all  everything is displayed including the fields I wish to hide. I have tried forcing the grid to use the FieldLayout by handling the grids AssigningFieldLayoutToItem event in the codebehind as followsp  precode    private void MyGridOnAssigningFieldLayoutToItemobject sender, AssigningFieldLayoutToItemEventArgs e              e.FieldLayout  MyGrid.FieldLayouts[0]      codepre  pAnd whilst this does apply the layout, it doesnt change the fields on the grid. p  pTo illustrate what happens If Type A has Fields 1, 2, 3 and Type B has fields 2, 3, 4  when Type B is displayed it will display a grid of all Type Bs instances, but with Type As fields  which of course does not make sense and some data is missing. We end up with a grid with the fields 1, 2, 3 and all of the cells from the 1 column are empty.p  pIt appears therefore that when a grid is created and the fieldlayout applied, the FieldLayout becomes coupled to the Fields it displays.p  pI have also tried adding the FieldLayout I require as a resource for my UserControl, setting codexSharedFalsecodeso that it can be reused, and adding it in the codebehind like sop  precode    MyGrid.FieldLayouts.Addthis.Resources[FieldLayout] as FieldLayout codepre  pThis essentially leaves me with the same behaviour as the original problem  the layout applies to the first grid and then is no longer used for subsequent grids. A combination of the above two solutions leaves me with the above issue of the Grid displaying the incorrect fields.p  pI would just like the same rules in the existing FieldLayout to be applied to every grid that is rendered. Any help would be much appreciated p  pIm attempting to follow an MVVM pattern so ideally would like to keep my codebehind clean, but if a solution requires a bit of codebehind I am of course willing to try as I have already.p  pThanksp  pstrongtldrstrong I swap out and render new grids at runtime, and need to apply the same FieldLayout to all of themp

Negative 27080 pIm using scikitlearn to perform binary classification, however the labels are not evenly distributed throughout the dataset. For cases where Im interested in predicting the minority class, I have some concerns about the average precision metric provided by codemetrics.averageprecisionscorecode. When I run the experiments, and print a classification report I see good performance on precision overall, but this is clearly from the model doing well on predicting the majority class, something like thisp  precode                     precision    recall    f1score    support label of interest    0.24         0.67      0.35        30 nonlabel            0.97         0.81      0.88        300 codepre  pThe codeaverage precisioncode is then reported as somewhere around code0.9752code. This average precision score is clearly being reported with respect to the majority class, which isnt really the class Im interested in identifying. Is there some way to modify the codemetrics.averageprecisionscorecode function to report the metric with respect to the minority class of interest Any insight would be greatly appreciated  thanks for reading.p

Negative 27080 pSo Ive been attempting to learn how to program openGL for the past little while and although it has been mindbending a lot of the time I think Im beginning to gain a solid understanding of how it works. p  pIve been using GLFW for window handling and basic input, and GLEW for accessing the extension methods.p  pIve also been following the tutorial over at a hrefhttpwww.learnopengl.com relnofollowwww.learnopengl.coma and that has been fairly useful. Lately, though, Ive been spending some time trying to create some basic abstractions for drawing to screen. When I abstracted away some of the code that the tutorial provided everything went fine Im still at the coordinate system section of Getting Started. p  pAfter doing that I decided it would be nice to emulate a simple UI overlay where I just have a function that draws a rectangle to the screen in 2D as opposed to 3D and just floats above everything else on the screen. Eventually I got something working with different shaders for the UI and the 3D objects. It successfully draws a colored rectangle to the screen on top of everything else, BUT unfortunately I have this bizarre problem that whenever I try to close the window by setting the glfwSetWindowShouldClose call to true the window can hang indefinitely.p  pWhenever I remove the call to draw the simple 2D rectangle this hang goes away and the window closes immediately as expected.

Negative 27080 pIs there a possibility  othern than writing a script myself  to do the followingp  pProblem I need to process about 11K files.

After processing  which changes the files  I need to put them back into the original subdirectories.p  pBecause this is something Ive to do onetime only, I dont want to code a script. But when I have to do it, then I would do it like thisp  pGet all files from all subdirectories. Save the original location of every file.

Negative 27080 pI have medium knowledge on how to make java webapps, and jsp pages. I am trying to extend my expertise, by learning how to use Spring MVC, AngularJS and RESTful apis.p  pI am having trouble drawing the lines between the dots. First of all, from what I have read, there should be no real need for jsp pages, when trying to do pure angularJS. So Im trying to not use jsps this time.p  pI am pretty much trying to make two htmlpages, each with a link to the other. Now in a completely basic Spring MVC setup, this would be done with the help of two controllers, and the ServletDispatcher. In the servletcontext.xml default name I could probably change the default suffix from .jsp to .html, but I have read that I should treat static html pages as resources, instead of views, as they do not need the powers of a servlet.p  pThe thing is, I have never made any kind of web page which didnt utilize a dispatcher, or front controller servlet, and although it might be completely obvious to most, I do not know what the alternative is. I am very in doubt if I am supposed to use the ServletDispatcher at all, and what the alternative is. I kinda thought the ServletDispatcher, and front controller pattern implementation was one of the most central parts of Spring...p  pSo should I use the ServletDispatcher for an Angular web application, or should I just use Spring to make the RESTful apip

Negative 27080 pI am building a messaging system for my web application using Spring MVC with Spring Data JPA and Hibernate as my JPA provider. p  pI have five entities codeThreadcode, codeThreadParticipantcode, codeParticipantcode, codeAccountcode and codeCompanycode. Each message thread has at least two participants, one of which is associated with a user codeAccountcode entity, and the other is associated with a codeCompanycode. This constraint is enforced by the application. The database is designed like this to support future features. An example of two participants for a given thread in the database looks as followsp  precodeid      accountid      companyid 1       44              NULL 2       NULL            123 codepre  pThe row with id1 is the user, and the row with id2 is the company. What I want to do is to write an HQL query that extracts all codeThreadcode objects for a given account, containing both the useraccount participant as well as the company participant.

If I only do a single join here, the generated SQL simply ignores my additional join and only joins to codeParticipantcode once, which requires a participant to have both an account and a company associated. With raw SQL, I can do like this, and it works finep  precodeselect  from thread t inner join threadparticipant usertp on usertp.threadid  t.id inner join threadparticipant companytp on companytp.threadid  t.id inner join participant userp on userp.id  usertp.participantid inner join account a on a.id  userp.accountid inner join participant companyp on companyp.id  companytp.participantid inner join company c on c.id  companyp.companyid where a.id  123 codepre  pIf I dont use different alias for the same table see the below query, the query runs fine, but I only get one of the thread participants returned  the one that is associated with the account.p  precodeselect distinct t from Thread t inner join fetch t.threadParticipants tp inner join fetch tp.participant p inner join fetch p.account a left join fetch p.company where a.id  accountId codepre  pIs there any way that I can do what I am trying to do with HQL, or do I have to go with using native SQLp  pMy mapping is as followsp  pstrongThread entitystrongp  precodeEntity Tablename  thread public class Thread      Id     GeneratedValuestrategy  GenerationType.IDENTITY     Column     private int id      OneToManyfetch  FetchType.LAZY, mappedBy  thread, cascade   CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.MERGE      private CollectionltThreadParticipantgt threadParticipants  new HashSetltgt       Getters and setters  codepre  pstrongParticipant entitystrongp  precodeEntity Tablename  participant public class Participant      Id     GeneratedValuestrategy  GenerationType.IDENTITY     Column     private int id      ManyToOnefetch  FetchType.LAZY, optional  true, targetEntity  Account.class, cascade   CascadeType.PERSIST      JoinColumnname  accountid     private Account account      ManyToOnefetch  FetchType.LAZY, optional  true, targetEntity  Company.class     JoinColumnname  companyid     private Company company       Getters and setters  codepre  pstrongThreadParticipant entitystrongp  precodeEntity Tablename  threadparticipant IdClassThreadParticipantPK.class public class ThreadParticipant implements Serializable      Id     ManyToOnefetch  FetchType.LAZY, targetEntity  Participant.class, cascade   CascadeType.PERSIST, CascadeType.MERGE      JoinColumnname  participantid     private Participant participant      Id     ManyToOnefetch  FetchType.LAZY, targetEntity  Thread.class     JoinColumnname  threadid     private Thread thread      Columnname  lastviewed, nullable  true     private Date lastViewed        Getters and setters  codepre  pstrongThreadParticipantPKstrongp  precodepublic class ThreadParticipantPK implements Serializable      private Thread thread     private Participant participant      public ThreadParticipantPK        public ThreadParticipantPKThread thread, Participant participant          this.thread  thread         this.participant  participant           Override     public boolean equalsObject o          if this  o return true         if o instanceof ThreadParticipantPK return false          ThreadParticipantPK that  ThreadParticipantPK o          if participant.equalsthat.participant return false         if thread.equalsthat.thread return false          return true           Override     public int hashCode          int result  thread.hashCode         result  31  result  participant.hashCode         return result            Getters and setters  codepre  pThank you in advancep

Negative 27080 pI have an application where I am dragging from a TreeView to a DataGrid. I have created an adorner a line along the top or bottom of the row with triangles at each side to indicate the position at which I am inserting the dragged item.  I have figured out the logic to indicate if I am inserting above or below the row based on if it is in the upper half or lower half of the row when dragging.p  pI have everything working the way I want except I am not sure how to detect when I have left the DataGrid.  I need to do this to turn off the adorner when dragging outside the DataGrid.  For instance, the user drags into the DataGrid from the TreeView and then drags out of the DataGrid.  The adorner is still showing.  Since the DragEnterDragLeave are bubbling events I cant use those or at least I am not sure how to go about it if I can because they fire over and over.  I have thought about hit testing or subscribing to a cursor change but I am not sure what to hit test for or how to subscribe to a cursor change event.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 27080 pI have a Scrapy crawler that is using localization ugettext .po files to localize some of the stuff its doing. It works fine when I enter the project and write codescrapy crawl ltspidergtcode, but when I deploy it to scrapyd using codescrapy deploy scrapyd p projectcode and run it with Scrapyd, then the log say that it can not find my localization files with the exception coderaise IOErrorENOENT, No translation file found for domain, domaincode.p  pI unzipped the .egg file to see if something was missing. Seems like my localization which is stored in locale was not included in the deployment. The folder was not there at all. So I added codeinit.pycode files to all the folders in locale and was able to make it included in the next .egg.p  pBut now, even though the folder is there. It says that the translation file can not be found.p  pI load the translation like this p  precodet  gettext.translationlanguage, localedirLOCALEDIR, languages[language] codepre  pLOCALEDIR is a variable stored in codeprojectprojectsettings.pycode.

I had to add the following code to include .mo and .po files in the .egg file that was generated. The code worked, the .mo and .po files are now included. But I still get the same error, when codescrapydcode runs the code, it cant find the .mo and .po files.p  pThe code I added to setup.py wasp  precodepackagedata        If any package contains .txt, .mo or .po files, include them      [.mo, .po, .txt], , codepre  pEDIT 2 Did some more digging.

The HTTP request itself is in an codeasynccode method, which looks pretty much like thisp  precodeprivate async TaskltIEnumerableltstring[]gtgt GenericGrabstring query      var req  WebRequest.Createnew Urihttpexample.org  query as HttpWebRequest     HttpWebResponse res     try              res  HttpWebResponse await req.GetResponseAsync  BOOM           Boring exception handlers skipped     StreamReader read  new StreamReaderres.GetResponseStream     string l     while true          l  await read.ReadLineAsync.ConfigureAwaitfalse         if l  null break          Process lines here           Return result of processing  codepre  pThis method is used for various different requests against the web service. It works most of the time but seems to fail when there is a little bit more data all responses are way below 1 MB, though. When it fails, the codeGetResponseAsynccode call, marked emBOOMem in the code, results in an codeOutOfMemoryExceptioncode in codemscorlib.ni.dllcode. Unsurprisingly, the call stack isnt terribly informativep  premyapp.exeMyApp.App.InitializeComponent.AnonymousMethod1eobject sender, Windows.UI.Xaml.UnhandledExceptionEventArgs e Line 50  C     [Native to Managed Transition]       [Managed to Native Transition]       mscorlib.ni.dllSystem.Runtime.InteropServices.WindowsRuntime.WindowsRuntimeMarshal.RoReportUnhandledErrorSystem.Runtime.InteropServices.WindowsRuntime.IRestrictedErrorInfo error    Unknown     mscorlib.ni.dllSystem.Runtime.InteropServices.WindowsRuntime.WindowsRuntimeMarshal.ReportUnhandledErrorSystem.Exception e    Unknown     System.Runtime.WindowsRuntime.NI.DLLSystem.Threading.WinRTSynchronizationContext.Invoker.InvokeCore  Unknown     System.Runtime.WindowsRuntime.NI.DLLSystem.Threading.WinRTSynchronizationContext.Invoker.InvokeInContextobject thisObj   Unknown     mscorlib.ni.dllSystem.Threading.ExecutionContext.RunInternalSystem.Threading.ExecutionContext executionContext, System.Threading.ContextCallback callback, object state, bool preserveSyncCtx    Unknown     mscorlib.ni.dllSystem.Threading.ExecutionContext.RunSystem.Threading.ExecutionContext executionContext, System.Threading.ContextCallback callback, object state, bool preserveSyncCtx    Unknown     System.Runtime.WindowsRuntime.NI.DLLSystem.Threading.WinRTSynchronizationContext.Invoker.Invoke  Unknown pre  pThe debugger breaks in codeApp.g.i.cscode which was generated by VS the code seems to be a generic catcher for exceptions.p  pI dont understand what could be going on here... the way I understand the API, the size of the response should not matter because it is being processed as a stream using codeGetResponseStreamcode, and the exception is thrown before that anyway.p  pCan anyone explain to me what might be causing thisp

Negative 27080 pI currently have a problem in python that I am not sure how to solve efficient. I have a large set of time series data that are read in to a generator. As of now, when I call yield, each data is given back to me one by one. This is all fine when each time series have the same index, where each start on the same date and end on the same date. The problem is when I have a set of time series data that do not have the same start date, but the same end date. p  pWhat is the best implementation whereby when I query, it will return a values for that specific date. This way i do not have to worry about start date.

Negative 27080 pstrongRequirementstrong  That our application processes files containing records and we have to maintain the log for the records in every file. The log file could easily be 100 MB at times in size.p  pstrongSolutionstrong  Since database operation would be very heavy, so we wanted to go for inmemory cache. Write the logs for a particular file into a redis key key might be the unique file name itself. Later when the user wants to see the log file, application should be able to read the contents from the cache using the unique key file name and write its content into a file which the user can seedownload.p  pstrongQuestionstrong  Is this a good idea that, we keep appending the logs for a particular file to the same key and later when we have to write to the file, we read from the key and write the contents to the file Basically the value of the redis key would always be string and its size might run into 100 MBs in size. Will there be any problems because of thisp
Negative 27080 pOne of the outputs from my software is written in to html5 format. It involves colorcoding a particular column of text depending on position chosen by user and I have implemented this using monospace font so as to keep text alignment which is of primary requirement. Such highlighted column should be labelled so as to easily track them.p  pCurrently I am doing this by displaying label text shown in red color vertically but as you could see it is not easily readable especially true when labels are right next to each other. It will be 1000x better if I could show the label in an angled manner preferably at 60 degrees. It cannot be hardcoded as the solution needs to scripting compatible.

Each substring cannot be longer than the whole url, after all and so reserving enough capacity as I do it looks like a good idea.p  pBut, once a substring is finished and I add it to the url parts list, I need to reset the string to length 0 one way or another. Brief peek definition inspection suggests to me that at least on my platform, the reserved buffer will be released and with that, the purpose of my reserve call is compromised.p  pInternally it calls some codeEos0code in case of clear.p  pI could as well accomplish the same with codecollector.resize0code but peeking definition reveals it also calls codeEosnewsizecode internally, so the behavior is the same as in case of calling codeclearcode.p  pNow the question is, if there is a emportableem way to establish the intended optimization and which codestdstringcode function would help me with that. p  pOf course I could write codecollector[0]  0code but that looks very off to me.p  pSide note While I found similar questions, I do not think this is a duplicate of any of them.p  pThanks, in advance.p

Negative 27080 pThis title might not actually make sense, because these things might be entirely different. First, let me explain why Im trying to learn about thisp  pIm currently trying to write a unit test for a method that touches a lot of properties. Due to that, Id prefer to write a test that takes in a list of property names as its member data and that will not start randomly failing if someone goes and changes the name of the property. At first, I started with string reflection, but I knew thats a bad idea as it fails that second caveat.p  pThat led me to the following thread and the following code a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19883645csharpreflectiongetpropertyinfowithoutastringC Reflection  Get PropertyInfo without a stringap  precodepublic static string GetPropertyNameltT, TReturngtExpressionltFuncltT, TReturngtgt expression      MemberExpression body  MemberExpressionexpression.Body     return body.Member.Name  codepre  pThis works well with GetValue, but now Im trying to understand it. I think I understand how the Expression class basically takes apart the expression lambda and builds a class from it, but Im trying to understand what the MemberExpression really is and what the difference is with it that allows me to access the name of a class property. I apologize if Im way off track here.p

Negative 27080 pThis is more of a conceptual question than a request for code critiquing. Specifically, Im trying to learn how to use UIRouter so that I can replace ngRoute in an application Im working on. As a proofofconceptexample for myself, I created a very basic single pager containing five wells, and within each well is a reference to a unique view.html with its own controller. Think of a label  vm.title  is my controller and a button that increments a count variable held in the views respective controller alongside its increment function. Each view has its own scope. p  pMy meager understanding of how to do this is that I must use the nginclude directive, since ngRoute cant allow for more than one view per page. If I replace ngRoute with UIRouter, could I intead create individual states for each partial view and connect them to their own controllers  URLs strongwithoutstrong using ngincludes I feel like Im misunderstanding something here.p  p...p  pFOLLOWUP QUESTIONS p  ul liCould I create one partial template instead of multiple individualbr views, and use UIRouter to bind it to multiple controllers and URLs  on the same page Would these multiple instances retain their ownbr counters, and would incrementing the counter in one instance of the view leave the counters in the other views unaffected Or would I need one copy of a view template for each controller I want to bindli liIf all the partial views are on one page, is it mandatory for me to bind URLs to them in order to create their own states, or is that only necessary if I want to, say, create anchor points for easier navigation within a larger pageli ul

Negative 27080 pI have written code to write the names of all folders and subfolders and the file count for each folder to a table.  I have three mapped drives in another table, and load an array with the mapped drive letters from that table, then loop through all drives listed in that table to populate the list.  p  pIt always crashing after doing a significant number for writes.  It doesnt seem to have anything to do with empty folders there are lots of those listed already as 0 files.  Even the folder name it crashes on is not unusual.  And it doesnt necessarily crash on the same folder each time, not after a set number of rows have been written.  I have tried changing the order of the drives in the table to see if its always failing on the same drive, but thats not the case, it fails during the first drive all the time, regardless of which drive is first T, R, S.

Moreover I cannot mix internal and external modules.p  p app.module.tsp  precodeimport angular from angular  import FirstService from .first.service import SecondService from .second.service  var app  angular.moduleapp, []  app.servicefirstService, FirstService app.servicesecondService, SecondService  export app codepre  p first.service.tsp  precodeclass FirstService      constructor    export default FirstService codepre  p second.service.tsp  precodeclass SecondService      constructorfirstService      export default SecondService codepre  pUPDATEp  pI can make ts happy with importing the module in the second servicep  precodeimport FirstService from .first.service  class SecondService      constructorfirstService FirstService     export default SecondService codepre  pBut is it correct I feel that I am making the DI somehow broken with importing the module as extra in the second service just for the type safety...p

Negative 27080 pDue to my original post being filled with flamers assuming that Im asking them to write my code for me and refusing to answer me at all, Im reposting my question.p  pI stress the fact that I am a total BEGINNER at Python, and that I am NOT here to ask people to write it for me, Im simply trying to ascertain the METHOD and some GUIDANCE on how to approach the problem, because Im having real difficulty approaching it, and everyone seems to think Im asking them to give me all the code I need, and Im not.p  pSo, on to my original question.p  pMy problem is as follows, I have made a mathematics quiz, that outputs the name and score to a text file. In this program, I plan to add some code at the beginning, which will run a list of options to compare and order the results from the text file. The program imports the entries into a list, and the format is as followsp  p[John  6, Bob  9, Billy  2, Matthew  7, Jimmy  2, Amy 9, Jenny  10, Michael  8]p  pPython recognizes this list as 8 items, perfect. It has their name, and then their score. The problem is that the specification Im working to requires me to be able top  pSort in alphabetical order with each students highest score for the tests.p  pAlso, by the highest score, and finally by the average score. Ive tried for many hours in order to find some code that can compare the integers within these strings to each other to find the highest score, and only print that one, but Ive had no luck. I feel like I will also struggle with the other 2 tasks, and wish for some guidance.p  pI thought about possibly using slices in order to take the integer into a separate value in order to compare them, but felt that this could make the code messy very quickly.p
