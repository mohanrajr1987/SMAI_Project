Positive 724 pI know what this code does copies the content from the memory pointed by ampx into the file, for sizeofdouble bytes reads the file and copies into the memory pointed by ampy, for sizeofdouble bytes.p  precodedouble x,y stdofstream out abc.dat, stdiosout  stdiosbinary out.write reinterpretcastltconst chargtampx, sizeofdouble out.close  stdifstream in abc.dat, stdiosin  stdiosbinary in.read reinterpretcastltchargtampy, sizeofdouble in.close codepre  pFrom what I understand, when doing binary IO, the data flowing between the file and RAM should be in terms of bytes. Then the ampx address should be passed as a byte location something like out.write reinterpretcastlt const byteampx, sizeofdouble would make sense. However C does not define a type byte, and here the char can be understood as a byte location, am I right I note that the size of char is identical as one byte, they are both 8 bits.p

Positive 724 pI am very new to docker, and I need help to dockerize a ruby script that takes a a input directory and output directory. p  pi.e codegeneraterrpair.rb BuildRR n data  o outputcodep  pWhat the script does, is it will take the n option input and check if the directory exists, if it does it uses the files inside as input. The script will then output data to the o option output. If the output directory doesnt exist, the script will create the directory and output files there. p  pHow can I create a Dockerfile to handle this Should I pass these in, as environment variables Or should I use mounted Volumes But since the script handles fileIO, I am not sure if I want volumes. The input directory should already exist on the host, and the output directory will get created. Both directories, should remain after docker container stops. p

Positive 724 pOk guys, I am completely over my head here. The Java courses at the college I just transferred from did not prepare me for the Java courses I am currently in, and it feels like a wile goose chase on this one.  With that being said, here we go.p  pThis is the homework problem I am working onp  p1 Create a Pixel Class, which contains an X coordinate, a Y coordinate, and a Color, as well as a drawGraphics page method, which displays the appropriate point.p  p2 Create a PixelReader class that reads a .txt file, and converts the data in the file to an ArrayList of Pixels.  The conversion method should be static and should be called getPixelsString fileName.  Remember that your method must declare that it throws an IOException.p  p3 Create a PixelPanel class that takes an ArrayList as a parameter.  The Panel should display the pixels.  The default dimensions of the PixelPanel class should be 100 x 100.p  pNOTE  Some of the data points are beyond the range allowed to RGB values.  You can handle those exceptional cases however you like.  For example, just reduce them to 255, reduce them to zero, find the remainder when divided by 256, or just throw the point out altogether.p  pI was good up until I got to reading the values from the text file into an ArrayList. Here is how the data is printedp  precode31 53 71 76 282 19 15 203 50 197 29 34 203 33 239 43 94 73 170 211 54 27 229 85 205 54 54 113 121 147 codepre  p....ect. until the end of the file.p  pThe data for each line is supposed to be x, y, height, width, color, if I read the instructions right. p  pNow, What I have so far in my code is thisp  precodepackage pixelpainthw  import java.util.ArrayList import java.awt.Color import java.io.BufferedReader import java.io.FileNotFoundException import java.io.FileReader import java.io.IOException import javax.swing.JOptionPane     author R.Scott  public class PixelReader        public static String filename  pixels.txt     public static FileReader reader      public static ArrayListltIntegergt pixelsInput throws  FileNotFoundException, IOException              ArrayListltIntegergt allPixels  new ArrayListltIntegergt     String[] currentPixelString      try              reader  new FileReaderfilename          catchFileNotFoundException e              filename  JOptionPane.showInputDialognull,File not found.n          Please locate and input the correct filepath.          finally              JOptionPane.showMessageDialognull, File successfully found.             return allPixels   codepre  pI have tried for several hours to construct code after the first trycatch that would read each line independently, put it into an array or arrayList, then append that to the master arraylist allPixels then send that to the class which actually draws the pixels, but the compiler keeps shooting out errors such as cant convert String[] to ArrayList, cant add array to arrayList, etc., and now I am supremely frustrated with it.p  pIm not asking anyone to write the code for me, but to point me in the right direction as to how to look at it in a way to wrap my head around it.  Also, please remember that Im still new to coding, so a complicated response that only a Doctorate level student could understand will probably go right over my head. p  pMuch appreciated guys. p  pIf needed, I can provide the other classes I have written in the program as well.p

Positive 724 pEditor FooEdit lets call it uses a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopaa36551228vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowReplaceFilea when saving to ensure that the save operation is effectively atomic, and that if anything goes wrong then the original file on disc is preserved. The other important benefit of ReplaceFile is continuity of file identity  creation date and other metadata.p  pFooEdit also keeps open a handle to the file with a sharing mode of just FILESHAREREAD, so that other processes can open the file but cant write to it while it while FooEdit has it open for writing.p  pObviously, this handle has to be closed briefly while the ReplaceFile operation takes place, and this allows a race in which another process can potentially open the file with write access before FooEdit reestablishes its FILESHAREREAD lock handle.p  pIf FooEdit doesnt close its FILESHAREREAD handle before calling ReplaceFile, then ReplaceFile fails with a sharing violation.p  pId like to know what is the simplest way to resolve this race. The options seem to be either to find another way to lock the file that is compatible with ReplaceFile I dont see how this is possible or to replicate all the behaviour of ReplaceFile, but using an existing file handle to access the destination file rather than a path. Im a bit stuck on how all of the operations of ReplaceFile could be carried out atomically from user code and reimplementing ReplaceFile seems a bad idea anyway.p  pThis must be a common problem, so probably theres an obvious solution that Ive missed.p  pThis question seems related but has no answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32532399Transactionally write a file change on Windowsa.p  hr  pHeres a minimal verifiable example showing what I am trying to achieve updated 1318 3092015 UTC.

Heres what I discovered while following up his suggestionsp  pIt seems ReplaceFile allows emlpReplacedFileNameem to be open FILESHAREREAD  FILESHAREDELETE, but emlpReplacementFileNameem cant be. And this behaviour doesnt seem to depend on whether emlpBackupFileNameem is supplied. So its perfectly possible to replace a file that another process has open even if that other process doesnt allow FILESHAREWRITE, which was Hans point.p  pBut FooEdit is trying to ensure no other process can open the file with GENERICWRITE emin the first placeem. To ensure in FooEdit that theres no race where another process can open the replacement file with GENERICWRITE, it seems that FooEdit has to keep hold emcontinuouslyem of a FILESHAREREAD  FILESHAREDELETE handle to emlpReplacementFileNameem, which then precludes use of ReplaceFile.p

Positive 724 pWe have an applet that performs file validations in our application. The user selects a File size about 280 Mb and the applet executes a lot of validations the advantage here is that the applet executes the validations clientside, so the file is not uploaded to the server. If the validation is okay, the user clicks an upload button and the file is uploaded to the server.p  pThe problem is that applets are not supported for the newest browsers, so we need an upgrade of our application.p  pHow can we access the user file system from the browser without using an appletp

Negative 724 pI have around 3500 flood control facilities that I would like to represent as a network to determine flow paths essentially a directed graph. Im currently using SqlServer and a CTE to recursively examine all the nodes and their upstream components and this works as long as the upstream path doesnt fork alot. However, some queries take exponentially longer than others even when they are not much farther physically down the path i.e. two or three segments downstream because of the added upstream complexity in some cases Ive let it go over ten minutes before killing the query. Im using a simple twocolumn table, one column being the facility itself and the other being the facility that is upstream from the one listed in the first column.p  pI tried adding an index using the current facility to help speed things up but that made no difference. And, as for the possible connections in the graph, any nodes could have multiple upstream connections and could be connected to from multiple downstream nodes.p  pIt is certainly possible that there are cycles in the data but I have not yet figured out a good way to verify this other than when the CTE query reported a maximum recursive count hit those were easy to fix.p  pSo, my question is, am I storing this information wrong Is there a better way other than a CTE to query the upstream points p

Negative 724 pI am working on a class library DLL project in Visual Studio 2008 programming in C. In order to test my DLL I just created a second project that is a console application and in that project I can reference the first and run tests. Is there a simpler way of doing this Can I just create another file within my class library project that has the tests in it and then somehow tell Visual Studio to run that filep  pI know one way would be to add a text file to my project and then write my test code in JScript. Then in the Project settings on the debug menu I can tell it to Start External Program JScript. Then, the name of my test file, codetest.jscode, goes in the Command Line Arguments box. But, I am wondering if there is a way to do it using C code instead of JScriptp

Negative 724 pI am getting started with Entity Framework using EF4 in VS 2010 RC. So far, I have done some simple console apps where I create an EDM, query it using LINQ to Entities, and output the results to the console.p  pNow I am building a demo WPF app to learn how to integrate EF4 with WPF. I use MVVM in my WPF apps, where each view more or less has a view model that includes data properties to which controls are bound.

So, how do I get from the codeIQueryableltCustomergtcode to codeObservableCollectionltCustomergtcode Thanks for your help.p

Negative 724 pIm pretty new to iPhone development and have struggled to find what I consider to be a neat way around this problem.p  pI have a user interface where a summary of record data is displayed in a table inside a navigation controller. When the user clicks the accessory button for a row, a new view is pushed onto the navigation controller revealing a view where the user can edit the data in the corresponding record. Once done, the editing view is popped from the navigation controllers stack and the user is returned to the table view.p  pMy problem is that when the user returns to the table view, the table still shows the state of the data before the record was edited. I must therefore reload the table data to show the changes.p  pIt doesnt seem possible to reload the table data before it is displayed as the call only updates displayed records. Reloading it after the table has been displayed results in the old data changing before the users eyes, which Im not too happy with.p  pThis seems to me like a pretty normal thing to want to do in an iPhone app.p  pCan anyone please suggest the best practice approach to doing this I feel like Im missing something.p  pCheers  Steve.p

Negative 724 pI have recently begun working on a PHPJS Form Class that will also include a SQL Form builder eg. building simple forms from sql and auto insertsupdates. p  pI have tried several classes zendform, clonefish, PHP Form Builder Class, phorms etc but as yet havent come across a complete solution that is simple, customizable and complete both server side and client side validation, covers all simple html elements and lots of dhtml elements sorting, wysiwyg, mutli file upload, date picker, ajax validation etcp  pstrongMy question is why do some classes implement elements via an array and others via proper OO class calls.strongp  peg.  Clonefish popular commercial php classp  precode    config  Array     username gt Array      type           gt inputText,      displayname    gt Username,      validation     gt Array        Array           type    gt string,          minimum gt 5,          maximum gt 15,        ,      ,      clonefish  new clonefish loginform, test.php, POST    clonefishgtaddElements config, POST  codepre  pThen others eg. ZendFormp  precodeform  new ZendForm username  new ZendFormElementTextusername usernamegtaddValidatornew ZendValidateAlnum formgtaddElementusername codepre  pI realise ZendForm can pass elements in via an array similar to clonefish but why do thisp  pIs there any benefit It seems to make things more complicated especially when using a proper IDE like Komodo.p  pAny thoughts would be appreciated as I dont want to get too far down the track and realize there was great benefit in using arrays to add elements although this wouldnt be much of a task to add on.p  pCheersp

Negative 724 pI was playing around with testing using machine specifications and there is something that i am just not able to do, was wondering if somebody have been there before,p  pIs there any way to using Rhino Mocks to create a stub for a method that uses a lambda expression, i found that i can do the followingp  pHaving this method in a sample classp  precodepublic void UpdateVisitint userId     var user  repository.FindByltUsergtxgtx.IduserId ampamp user.IsActive true     user.Visit  user.Visit  1     repository.Saveuser  codepre  pI can stub the method like thisp  precode...Inside test method var user  new User repository.Stubxgtx.FindByltUsergtArgltExpressionltFuncltUser,boolgtgtgt.Is.Anything.Returnuser codepre  pThe thing is I would like to stub the method not to strongAny Lambda Expressionstrong, just for the strongspecific lambda expressionstrong codexgtx.IduserId ampamp user.IsActive truecode, so that the test would fail if this expression changes in the method...p  pI guess i could create a mock repository that does not go to the database and test the behavior in the lambda though this, i was wondering if there is another approach to this...p  pAppreciate any suggestions on this, Thanksp
Negative 724 pIm trying to duplicate the design of the mail app on the iPhone. On the toolbar the label updates  changes to show the status of mail being sent. p  pWhat is the best way to duplicate this The following are what Ive thought through and maybe someone can suggest why one of them would work or a new idea.p  pFor unity sake, lets say I have the following views codeA gt B gt C  Dcode. codeAcode, codeBcode, and codeCcode are pushed on and off the UINavigationController and have the toolbar in question. codeDcode is the compose window and is a modal window of codeCcode. And lets call the object Im trying to create is codeobjcode.p  pstrongDelegatestrongp  pThis would require me creating one codeobjcode in codeAcode and pass it to codeBcode, and codeCcode. codeCcode would call a method such as codesendMailcode on codeobjcode and it would attempt to send the email. obj would have a delegate method codeobjhasUpdateForToolbarcode which would send an array to the delegated class codeCcode in order to update the toolbar. Through the send process it would send multiple messages in order to update a progress bar and at the end to say it was successful sent or a date at which the last email check happened.p  pemThe problemem with this solution is it doesnt update codeAcode or codeBcode. When codeCcode gets popped off, it the delegate would need to be reassigned to codeBcode and there would be I think a flash of the old value in the toolbar before the next value is pushed by codeobjcode.p  pstrongNotificationsstrongp  pThis would be cleaner than the delegate in that you wouldnt have to pass the object to every class which means less dependency between classes. But since you have no connection you would have to have codeCcode post a notification that there is a new mail ready to be sent. codeobjcode would have to receive that notification and then would have post new notifications instead of the delegate method.p  pemThe problemem with this is that it is common practice to unsubscribe to a notification when the view isnt being shown. So I think there would be the same flash as codeBcode subscribes to the notification and waits for it to get pushed the next update for the toolbar.p  pstrongKVCstrongp  pIm really not sure how I could set this up so that KeyValue Coding takes care of it. Am I able to setup a view in codeobjcode that gets put into the toolbar of each view and as it gets updated either with a label or progress bar it would be reflected in every toolbarp  pSo which is best  what am I missing on thesep

Where CodeIgniter can help is lets say I have 2 programmers in my team, so each one of us do a module for each ControllerViewModel for example Programmer A does News module, Programmer B does Gallery module in different folders folder news and gallery, etc.p  pSo the end product will be a group of modules in seperate folders. home , content, news, gallery, contact , etc.p  pIs that the right flow of teamwork using CI I read that CI can be used to collaborate between designers front end CSS and programmers database and controller but I think with this flow, designers will have to wait for programmers to get the variable names to be parsed into the view and that will somehow halt the progress of the work.p

Negative 724 pHow does Varnish caching affect thirdparty cookies set by Omniture and firstparty cookies set by Google Analyticsp  pSo far Ive seen opposing opinions, some people say that because the tracking stats are created by JavaScript which is true, that stripping these Cookies from the request wont affect GA or Omniture.p  pHowever a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions871283howdotrackingcookiesworkherea they are saying that these softwares set various cookies to track recurring visitors, and so stripping these cookies from the request would essentially count every user as a new visitor.p  pI dont want my users to count every time as a new visitor. I am not sure either that these JavaScript embeds have the ability to calculate if the page is being served to a first time or recurring visitor. Any links to offical GA or Omniture documentation is deeply appreciated.p

Negative 724 pUsing CakePHP2.0 Beta I managed to write a custom login handler for my existing database schema. Alls well, except that upon logging in I printed out the session variables stored and what Cakes Auth component did is store the entire record from the Member table where my usernameshashes come from in session. It is storing an array with data fields that are totally irrelevant to the session. For instance it stores the date the member was created, their address, etc. All pretty useless information for me as I basically only need their ID and maybe username, name, email address.p  pThe offending lines for me are found in libCakeControllerComponentAuthComponent.php line 512. It states,p  pcodethisgtSessiongtwriteselfsessionKey, usercodep  pSo my custom authenticate component returns user and it throws this whole thing into the session. Now, I dont want to go about editing in the core libraries because this project is definitely going to be upgraded when 2.0 comes out. Is there any way to store less information in sessions I want to keep this whole thing more lightweight.p  pPossible solution Change my custom authentication component to only return the fields I need into the user variable. Are there any concerns about what data I shouldshouldnt be returningp

But this approach would require a recompile if we want to add new layout to the page.

I fetched the pixel color value with mIntermediateMat.getx,y. Thats just wrong. As function is defined as Mat.getrows,cols it would be mIntermediateMat.gety,x. See the difference I didnt. Lots of lost time and another dumbness award for me.p

AB1234ZA, AB1234ZB, ...C ...D.p  pMy first thought was to query the DB and do all the processing in PHP arrays, then send queries back to update. But since there can be 30,000 to process at a time, this will result in 30,000 UPDATE queries one for each chopped sku anyway.p  pIf it could be done with a single MySQL statement it would be much faster. p  pAny ideasp  pEDIT To add more detailp  pTotal number of records could be 2,000  35,000 per batch. With the chopping, it will create groups of duplicates. If each group has less than 26 members, then 1 digit of serialization is enough. Otherwise 2 digits 26 x 26  676 and its very unlikely a group would be larger than that. Ideally, the query would take into account the number of duplicates in each group and apply 1 or 2 digits of serialization depending. I know its a lot to ask. jonstjohns answer looks like a good start. I will test it tomorrow. I havent used mysql variables for anything yet but it looks promising.p

The checkUniversity.jsp is used to connect to the database and do the checking. But the code is not doing it. I have spent hours on it and still cant figure it out.

Negative 724 pI am using Google App Engine and using Googles datastore interface for a database .  My question is this , I have the following code  I have a network object that I want to either update if it exists on db , or to create if its the first time. .

Negative 724 pWith Unicorn, you can restart and reload a Rails app with codekill USR2 [master process]code, which doesnt kill the process immediately, but starts a new master process  slave processes in the background. When the new master is ready, you can shut off the old master with codekill QUITcode.

Negative 724 pextMyself and two coworkers have been working on a GWT project and coding in eclipse. The project is growing and we are bringing on several new developers to help out. I have been tasked with setting up their workstations before they start work. Our current systems all worked out of the box following the basic GWT set up guide httpcode.google.comwebtoolkitusingeclipse.htmlp  pOn my working system I have not changed any of the defaults that eclipse has set for memory size. p  pThe new system will run the simple starter projects, so I know that I have GWT set up. When I import our current code base I can run the site locally without issue. When I try and run the ant script that we have to build our project and push it out to our dev server the new system complainsp  pcodeException in thread main java.lang.OutOfMemoryError GC overhead limit exceededcodep  pOn the new system I have modified the eclipse.ini file to and set Xmx1024M and I have added Xmx1024M under WindowPreferencesJavaInstalled JREs neither of which have solved the problem. shown here a hrefhttpdinu.blog.com20100602outofmemoryhttpdinu.blog.com20100602outofmemoryap  pI have tried 32 and 64 bit versions of eclipse, and I have even tried just copying my known working eclipse folder onto the new system without any luck.

Negative 724 pA quick warning I am pretty new to Rails, and my knowledge is somewhat cookiecutteresque. I know how to do certain things, but I lack that vital understanding of why they always work.p  pI currently have a User model that has in it a bunch of information, like address, email, etc. In addition, it also has a hash called visible. The keys in that hash are each of the pieces of information, and the value is either true or false for whether the user wishes that information to be publicly visible. While Im not sure if this is the best way to go, I cant think of any other way other than making a whole ton of boolean variables for each bit of information. Finally, I serialize visible for storage in the databasep  pWhat I would like is in my edit view to have a checkbox beside each field of info that represents the visible attribute.  After reading tons of other posts related to this topic and trying numerous variations of code, I always end up with some kind of an error. The code that looks most intuitively correct to me is as followsp  precodelt formforuser, id gt forminfopersonal do f gt ... lt f.label name gt lt f.textfield name gt lt f.checkbox visible[name] gt codepre  pBut I get an error message saying that a Symbol cannot be parsed into an integer. Im not sure where this parse is even trying to happen, unless its viewing visible as an array and trying to use name as an index.p  pI apologize in advance if this question is trivialseemingly nonsensicallacking vital informationetc. Any tips, suggestions, links, or what have you would be very appreciated, even if theyre along the lines of youre doing this fundamentally wrong, go back and do it this way.p  pNickp

If I have a case like this, its not possible for me to do a regex match in the router against a known property type because propertytypes can potentially return several hyphenated types.p  pstrongMy question then is, Is it possible for me to take the propertytypes string and modify it specifically for the requirements matching  If I can replace apartmentloft to just be apartment for that match w, then I have something I can realistically regex match against.strongp  precodeHeres what the two routes actually look like  map.location transactioncountrycodepropertytypes,   controller gt search,   action gt location,   requirements gt  transaction gt forsaleforrentauctionnewdevelopment, countrycode gt ww, propertytypes gt proptypes   map.location transactioncountrycodelocation,   controller gt search,   action gt location,   requirements gt  transaction gt forsaleforrentauctionnewdevelopment, countrycode gt ww codepre  pThe above implementation works fine for routes that have one propertytype, but for routes that have multiple hyphenated propertytypes, Im hitting a wall.p

Negative 724 pI have written a small model in Matlab. This model analyses several supply nodes to meet the required amount of demand, in a demand node. Supply nodes are specified in a vector, in which for each timestep the available supply is given.p  pTo meet the demand, supply nodes are analysed subsequently whether they can meet the demand, and the fluxes from the supply nodes to the demand node are updated accordingly. This analysis now uses a fixed order, which is defined by the script code.

Negative 724 pI have learned how to use Spring MVC 3, but I am very interested in background of it. One of the most interesting things to me is forms handling.p  pSo far, I know that every http request in handled by dispatcher, mapped to proper controller.

Than web page is send back in http response.p  pThis seems all right for me, in most case scenarios. But, form handling is different. In codeltformformgtcode  tag, you defined object and attributes mapping to it. But in logic mentioned above, it actually never gets invoked. I mean, user requests page with form. So controller renders it. Than user send form, and some save method is invoked by dispatcher. But how does Spring know how to map incomming attributes, if they are described in JSPX that is not invokedp  pAlso, if you know any good, preferably web, resource on Spring MVC background, post a link. Thank you.p

Negative 724 pIm working on a project that I parse an XML feed containing 2001000 animals. I have everything parsing correctly and displayed in a single table view.

Im not sure on the best approach to separate the parsed data. My current thoughts have been top  ol liCreate three NSObject classes  dogList, catList, and otherList and do the sorting during the parsing right now I just use one NSObject List and pull data into table view using, ie. theList.Name syntax. Then pull that into the corresponding table.li liSomehow do the sorting work at the table controller level of the specific species Im looking for, then display.li ol  pI have done some research however I dont want to sort ascendingdescending or simply find one element, instead I want to pluck out all the data in ltcodeDataFeedAnimalgtcode.

After this is done I want to clean everything up, thus removing everything from that dummy user directory using codeshutils.rmtreecodep  pI have a dummy class wrapping the original one that prevents it from getting the real user directory and returns the dummy instead. Though Im afraid somebody might forget this and perhaps change it or completely remove the wrapper class. This might work and the developer will end up loosing everything from hisher home directory. Though this might teach himher a good lesson, it is not acceptable.p  pI can check that tmp is at the path start of the user home, so that I know its safe to delete, but that wont work with windows. As tempfile already knows how to create a directory it would be also able to tell if a directory is in the emtemporalem area. Though I cant find out how to do it.p  pAny ideasp

R is the arrival rate, by probability, for all 18   intervals which is more or less r60.p      pThe purpose of this simulation is to define r ourselves and see the   average waiting time avgWait of each customer in all 18 intervals.

Negative 724 pstrongRequirementstrong I am building a REST API. It has two REST calls. The call format to output formatted JSON based on the parameters provided. The call raw with same parameters should output JSON with raw values without the formatting. The formatting here would be locale specific like date changes, displaying the correct currency, decimal formatting, time formatting etc for the values. p  pstrongToolsstrong Java, Tomcat, Spring, Apache CXF, JAXRS and Jackson. p  pstrongImplementationstrong REST service is setup and works fine. No problems there. I have written seperate custom serializers in which I provide desired formatting using NumberFormat, DateFormat, DecimalFormat etc. I have extended the SimpleModule from Jackson to register all my custom serializers mentioned above. I am using two separate ObjectMapper FomatOM and RawOM.FormatOM registers the custom Module for formatted JSON output, RawOM is for raw JSON output as per the requirement. These two objectmappers are registered to two different JacksonJsonProviders and declared as beans in my spring config xml. For format I use FormatOM with custom serializers, and in raw I use RawOM.p  pstrongProblemstrong It doesnt work as I would have expected. I expected that when I make a request through format call the FormatOM would be used and for raw RawOM would be used. What is happening is whichever call I make first, subsequent calls are served using the same ObjectMapper. Thus, if the first call is raw subsequent calls to format or raw render raw JSON output. After a Tomcat restart, if the first call is to format then subsequent calls to either API calls render formatted JSON outputp  pstrongQuestionsstrong  1. How do you achieve my requirement for rendering formatted  raw JSON     output  2. Whats is wrong with my implementation  3. Any ideas or suggestions or critiques  4.

Negative 724 pI have been looking for a way to protect my RESTful APIs. This appeared simple, but it seems to not be so simple. First off, I am writing an iOS app connecting to a Play Framework server. None of this has anything to do with Google, Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn shocking I know. Oh, and my current plans do not require custom apps to use my APIs, its just my apps for the time being.p  pstrongBasic Authenticationstrongp  pWhat appeared to be simple was a basic userpass on a auth method managing a cookie session. That may draw some groans as being too simple or weak but mostly it moved identity to a session key quickly verified. My initial setup was to expire the sessions every day, but that lead to the iOS app forcing a login daily proving to be an annoyance.p  pstrongOAuthstrongp  pI posted a question on an iOS board and received a blunt direction towards OAuth. My research of OAuth began but holy sht is that complicated and there does not seem to be any server side examples... just plenty of people complaining about how frustrating it is. All the client examples show connecting to Google, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Oh Joyp  pAfter watching Eran Hammers rant about OAuth1 and OAuth2, it seemed fruitless to continue and his OZ idea which looks really clean is only at the early stages in node.js. p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pSo, my question to the broad StackOverflow community is... what do you do for securing your REST APIs p

Negative 724 pFirst, a bit of background.  Read the question and accepted answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8352260whydoesthesqlparameternamevalueconstructortreat0asnullposted herea for a specific scenario for my question.  Im not sure if other, similar cases exist but this is the only case I am aware of.p  pThe above quirk is something that Ive been aware of for a long time.  I didnt understand the full breadth of the cause until just recently.p  pMicrosofts documentation on the codeSqlParametercode class sheds a little more light on the situation.p  blockquote   pWhen you specify an codeObjectcode in the value parameter, the codeSqlDbTypecode is   inferred from the Microsoft .NET Framework type of the Object.p      pUse caution when you use this overload of the codeSqlParametercode constructor   to specify integer parameter values. Because this overload takes a   value of type codeObjectcode, you must convert the integral value to an codeObjectcode   type strongwhen the value is zerostrong, as the following C example demonstrates.p      pcodeParameter  new SqlParameterpname, Convert.ToInt320codep      pIf you do   not perform this conversion, strongthe compiler assumes that you are trying   to call the SqlParameter string, SqlDbType constructor overload.strongp blockquote  pemph. addedp  pMy question is why does the compiler assume that when you specify a hard coded 0 and only the value 0 that you are trying to specify an enumeration type, rather than an integer type  In this case, it assumes that you are declaring codeSqlDbTypecode value, instead of the value 0.p  pThis is nonintuitive and, to make matters worse, the error is inconsistent.  I have old applications that Ive written which have called stored procedures for years.  Ill make a change to the application often times not even associated with my SQL Server classes, publish an update, and this issue will all of a sudden break the application.p  pstrongWhy is the compiler confused by the value 0, when an object containing multiple method signatures contain two, similar signatures where one parameter is an objectinteger and the other accepts an enumerationstrongp  pAs Ive mentioned, Ive never seen this as a problem with any other constructor or method on any other class.  Is this unique to the codeSqlParametercode class or is this a bug inherit within C.Netp

Negative 724 pI am creating a custom component that inherits from the TMSFMXGrid.  I am developing in Firemonkey using RAD XE3.

Also, in my custom components parent class, this method is not declared.p  pWhen I go comment out the ApplyStyle procedure in the FMX.TMSCustomGrid.pas source code, everything works fine form my custom components.  However, when I create a TMSGrid which is the parent component of my component the style is not applied correctly.p  pI am beyond confused.  Why does the function GetClassStyleName throw an error about the ApplyStyle procedure Is there maybe a way to un inherit a method if that even makes sense  p

Negative 724 pSo, a few weeks ago, I asked about a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16151702oracleexecutionplancostvsspeedOracle execution plan cost vs speed a in relation to the FIRSTROWSn hint. Ive run into a similar issue, but this time around the ORDERED hint. When I use the hint, my execution time improves dramatically upwards of 90, but the EXPLAIN PLAN for the query reports an enormous cost increase. In this particular query, the cost goes from 1500 to 24000. p  pThe query is paramterized for pagination, and joins 19 tables to get the data out. Id post it here, but it is 585 lines long and is written for a vendors messy, godawful schema. Unless you happened to be intimately familiar with the product this is used for, it wouldnt be much help to see it. However, I gathered the schema stats at 100 shortly before starting work on tuning the query, so the CBO is not working in the dark here. p  pIll try to summarize what the query does. The query essentially returns objects and their children in the system, and is structured as a large subquery block joined directly to several tables. The first part returns object IDs and is paginated inside its query block, before the joins to other tables. Then, it is joined to several tables that contain child IDs. p  pI know that the CBO is not all knowing or infalible, but it really bothers me to see an execution plan this costly perform so well it goes against a lot of what Ive been taught. With the FIRSTROWS hint, the solution was to provide a value n such that the optimizer could reliably generate the execution plan. Is there a similar kind of thing happening with the ORDERED hint for my queryp

Negative 724 pI already tried to fix it myself by reading some other questions like this one  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8564198whydoesntjqgridfrozencolumnseemtoworkwithfilterrowsandfilterheadin86205748620574why doesn39t Jqgrid frozen column seem to work with filter rows and filter headingap  pbut i gues the grid has changed since then because i am not able to call the complete method or im doing something wrong.p  pSo right now only a copy of the headers are moving and not the data, the height of the headers isnt correct neither but i presume thats because i rotate the headers and adjust the height afterwards in javascript. It is pretty out of the box except for rotating the headers but without it its not working neither p  pI made a clean code example so helping will be a bit easier, in my situation i also use some custom code to rotate my headers but even without it the frozen columns are not working.p  pany help will be much appreciated p  pThe Htmlp  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt     lttitlegtJqgridtestlttitlegt

Negative 724 pI am trying to run a program called Phenoripperimage analysis software that utilizes MCR inside of a Hadoop multinode setup version 1.1.2 on Ubuntu 13.04. The hadoop setup works perfectly with generic pythonjava mapreduce jobs however, when I try to use phenoripper in the setup I get this errorp  pboostfilesystemcreatedirectorypermission deniedp  pI have asked the devs of Phenoripper about this and they have assured me that their program is not creating or writing to temporary directories and since it works on a single computer perfectly I believe that MCR is responsible for this error. If I understand correctly, it is trying to create a temporary directory somewhere where it doesnt have permission, likely on one of the slave nodes. Does anyone have any idea where this directory might be located or how to find it If I can find this directory, my solution would be to permanently create it with appropriate permissions. Does this sound like a viable solution Any ideas as to what on earth is going onhow to fix it would be much appreciatedp

Negative 724 pstrongUpdate My NOAA GHCNDaily weather station data functions have since been cleaned and merged into the emrnoaaem package, available on CRAN or herestrong a hrefhttpsgithub.comropenscirnoaa relnofollowhttpsgithub.comropenscirnoaaap  pIm designing a R function to calculate statistics across a data set comprised of multiple data frames. In short, I want to pull data frames by class based on a reference data frame containing the names. I then want to apply statistical functions to values for the metrics listed for each given day. In effect, I want to call and then overlay a list of data frames to calculate functions on a vector of values for every unique date and metric where values are not NA.p  pThe data frames are iteratively read into the workspace from file based on a class variable, using the by function. After importing the files for a given class, I want to rbind the data frames for that class and each userdefined metric within a range of years. I then want to apply a concatenation of userprovided statistical functions to each metric within a class that corresponds to a given value for the year, month, and day i.e., the mean [function] low temperature [class] on July 1st, 1990 [date] reported across all locations [data frames] within a given region [class]. I want the end result to be new data frames containing values for every date within a region and a year range for each metric and statistical function applied. I am very close to having this result using the aggregate function, but I am having trouble getting reasonable results out of the aggregate function, which is currently outputting NA and NaN for most functions other than the mean temperature.

Negative 724 pSo I have some erb that dynamically generates stepbystep instructions based on a users input.

I have the XY position of each tag so I want to dynamically crop around each tag to reduce their width when the instructions load I think 300px would be fine.

Negative 724 pI just reinstalled Windows on my machine. Before that, I was using the codeEclipse CDT IDEcode for Windows 64bit with MinGW compiler suite downloaded using mingwget. Everything worked perfectly fine before the reinstall.p  pAfter the installation I tried to compile and run my C projects, but I always got the codeterminated, exit value ltsome numbergtcode error in the console, even for a codeHello Worldcode project. I also got an error saying the codelibgccsdw21.dllcode is missing from my computer when I tried to run the executable from the command line.p  pSo I uninstalled MinGW and tried again and it did not work. I completely removed anything related to MinGW from my system, I removed Eclipse, deleted every workspace, cleaned everything or at least I think. Then I created a fresh codeEclipsecode folder, then installed the codeMinGWcode and created path variables. Everything looked like they have been reset and now when I try to compile and run anything, the compilations seems to work fine but running the executable is still not possible. I still get the same error on every launch. Cleaning the project did not work either. I tried several other workarounds both from Stack Overflow and other sources but they did not work for me either and I am clueless at this point and stuck.p  pI would really appreciate any help regarding this problem.

Negative 724 pI benchmarked a Java program on a 16 core NUMA machine with Red Had Linux. I measured the throughput of a Java DatagramSocket for UDP in terms of how many packets of 64 Bytes size it was able to receive and send per second. The program consisted of a single socket and n threads that were listening on the socket. When a packet arrived, they would copy the payload into a byte[] array, create a new DatagramPacket with that array and send it straightaway back to where it came from. Think of it as a ping on the UDP layer.p  ol lipI found that the Java DatagramSocket socket achieves a significantly smaller throughput when using more than one thread, i.e. two or four. If I use only one thread to listen on the socket, I achieve a throughput of 122,000 packets per second, while more than one threads achieve only 65,000 packets per second. Now, I understand that a thread might be executed on any core of the NUMA machine and that memory accesses become expensive if the memory has to travel from one node to another. However, if I have two threads, only one should be executed on the wrong core, while the other should still achieve a very high throughput. Another possible explanation is a synchronization problem in the Datagramsocket but these are only guesses. Does anybody have a good insight in what the real explanation ispli lipI found that executing this program multiple times in parallel on multiple ports achieves a higher overall throughput. I started the program with one thread four times and each program used a socket on a separate port 5683, 5684, 5685 and 5686. The combined throughput of the four programs was 370,000 packets per second. In summary, using more than one thread on the same port decreases the throughput, while using more than one port with one thread each increases it. How is this explainablepli ol  pSystem specificationsp  pHardware 16 cores on 2 AMD OpteronTM Processor 6212 processors organized in 4 nodes with 32 GB RAM each.

Negative 724 pId like to get some clarification on something that Ive been confused on for awhile.p  pIve tried to read as much documentation both 1st and 3rd party on the generation of IDL and MetaData files for Runtime Components as I could, and perhaps it lies in my ability to comprehend the material, but Im still a little very lost.p  pIf I understand correctly, once a Runtime Component is compiled into a DLL, that is used to generate an IDL file which is then used in the creation of windows meta data files. In the MS sample app Chatterbox VoIP, the Runtime component project has a custom build step PostBuildEvent that does the followingp  precodepushd OutDir  WinMdIdl.exe OutDirRootNamespace.winmd  MIdl.exe env MidlEnv winrt nsprefix metadatadir FrameworkSdkDirWindows Metadata out SolutionDirProjectNameProxyStub OutDirRootNamespace.idl  MIdl.exe env MidlEnv winrt nsprefix metadatadir FrameworkSdkDirWindows Metadata out SolutionDirProjectNameProxyStub OutDirRootNamespace.OutOfProcess.idl  ProjectDirOopServerRegistrationHelper.exe winmdOutDirRootNamespace.winmd dllnameTargetName namespaceRootNamespace.OutOfProcess appmanifestSolutionDirUIPropertiesWMAppManifest.xml helperdirSolutionDirAgents  popd codepre  pHowever, in a project of my own, using a simple c class in a Runtime component referenced in a C app, I never did any manual configuration for the creationprocessing of IDL files. I simply added a reference in the C project to my CCX Runtime Project, compiled, and it worked. p  pSo, what is the deal here Are the IDL and WinMD files automatically generated for every Runtime Component Project Or am I doing something incorrectlyinefficiently by not using these IDL processing toolsp  pLet me know if I need to include any more information.p

Negative 724 pI recently started to work with an API in our Java application environment which uses JOGL makes OpenGL commands accessible in Java to create a 3D environment within our application so I am pretty new to OpenGL. p  pThis API uses display lists to group and speed up the commands to display a geometric component. So far, in the display method, first all the changes to the scene made by the mouse are applied zoom, rotation, translation, then the current display list is called.  The API provides a variety of scene elements surfaces, light, transformations which are put into a treelike structure. This structure determines the order in which these scene elements will be executed later. This execution of the scene tree is than put into a display list. This works as intended.p  pWhat I want to add now is a small coordinate system as a representation of the components current orientation. This would be a new scene element to be added to the scene tree. This coordinate system should obviously be influenced by rotations done with the mouse, but it should not be scaled or translated to other places.p  pMy problem is As the mouse movements are applied outside of the execution of the scene tree, I dont know how to apply strongonly the rotationstrong to strongonly a certain scene elementstrong of the tree. I cant just revert the mouse movement in the corresponding part of the display list in my understanding because that would mean the display list would have to take the parameter of the mouse positions changes. But I cant work with parameters in display lists as their state is determined once and then only executed in this state correct. I cant just reset the projection matrix as I would lose the rotation state.p  pI hope my problem is understandable. Is there a way to do this with display lists or do I might have to replace the display lists in this API with an alternative They dont seem to be recommended anyway.p

No combination of codeinlinecode, codeexterncode, codestaticcode, and codeattributealwaysinlinecode on the prototype andor the definition changes this obviously some combinations of these specifiers cause it to not even compile andor produce warnings, not talking about those. Im using codeg .cpp O3 o runcode and codeg .cpp O3 Scode for assembly output. When I look at the assembly output, I still see codecall funccode. It appears only way I can get the function to be properly inlined is to have the prototype probably not necessary and the definition of the function in the header file. If the header is only included by one file in the whole program included by only codemain.cppcode for example it will compile and the function will be properly inlined without even needing the codeinlinecode specifier. If the header is to be included by multiple files, the codeinlinecode specifier appears to be needed to resolve multiple definition errors, and that appears to be its only purpose. The function is of course inlined properly.p  pSo my question is am I doing something wrong Am I missing something Whatever happened top  pThe compiler is smarter than you. It knows when a function should be inlined better than you do. And never ever use C arrays. Always use stdvectorp  pEvery other StackOverflow userp  pReally So calling func5 and printing the result is faster than just printing 32 I will blindly follow you off the edge of a cliff all mighty all knowing and all wise gcc.p  pFor the record, the above code is just an example. I am writing a ray tracer and when I moved all of the code of my math and other utility classes to their header files and used the codeinlinecode specifier, I saw massive performance gains. Literally like 10 times faster for some scenes. p
Negative 724 pIn .NET WebAPI, Ive created a way to have all of the authorization rules in a central location, rather than scattered throughout controllers. Im curious why this centralization isnt done more often are there repercussionssecurity concernsp  pMy current approach is to create a Dictionary during AppStart that contains all of my Authorization data then using a DelegatingHandler to apply the restrictions code below. The dictionary key is a Tuple of the Controller and Action, and the value is the authorized roles.

Negative 724 pSo I have a small database, first form a user sees is the login form where they enter in a username and password stored in tblEmployees, from here if they can login, it takes them to the main menu. On this main menu is a button I want visible if the user who logs in happens to have a value in tblEmployees under the column admin. p  pThe form they use to login with frmLogon is minimized the entire time they have the database open because other forms reference it. I thought about making it where on the main menu form on the FormLoad event to reference the name they selected, but its a query pulling just a name, no record, would that still workp  pThanks p

So I apologize if this question already exists.p  pstrongPROBLEMstrong BR I want to be able to access the request type of a request inside of a generic method within my Controller.p  pstrongDESCRIPTIONstrong BR Using Spring ROO and Spring MVC, I have developed a small web service that will respond with certain tidbits from a database when queried. In one of my controller classes, I have some methods that handle some variety of GET, PUT, POST, etc., for the URIs that are mapped within the RequestMapping parameter.p  pFor example p  precodeRequestMappingmethod  RequestMethod.Get, value  foobar ResponseBody public ResponseEntityltStringgt getFooBar       stuff  codepre  pIf a request is made to the web service that it is not currently mapped, a 405 error is returned which is correct, but I want to return more information along with a 405 response. Maybe respond with something like p  pI know you tried to execute a [some method], but this path only handles [list of proper methods].p  pSo I wrote a short method that only has the RequestMappingp  precodeRequestMappingvalue  foobar codepre  pI have found that the method with this mapping will catch all unhandled request types.

Negative 724 pstrongMY ISSUEstrong p  pIm working on an app that sends sensor data over UDP. The data sent is correct, but it runs into heavy lag at times. It appears that there are simply too many packets being sent. The stream gets held up, causing a slowdown of received packets followed by a burst of many packets at once.p  pI feel that the issue is how fast the sensor is being updated. onSensorChanged is being called as often as the sensor updates, which then triggers the call to the udpClient asynctask. strongIs there a way that I can slow this downstrong The sensor updates very quickly and therefore sends packets very frequently.p  pstrongWHAT IVE TRIEDstrongp  pI have tried adjusting the update rate with SENSORDELAY constants as well as microsecond int values, but this has no effect. The android developer page states that this is only a hint, and not a guarantee of the sensor update rate.

I have found this whitepaper Memory managment in the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine a hrefhttpwww.oracle.comtechnetworkjavajavasetechmemorymanagementwhitepaper1150020.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.oracle.comtechnetworkjavajavasetechmemorymanagementwhitepaper1150020.pdfa . But it has only general ideas. It has a good description probably it is not so good  see my second question of the Parallel compacting algorithm I mean parallel marksweepcompact but it doesnt explain other garbage collectors algorithms. However this whitepaper is the best information I was able to find on the Internet. What I would like to know is where to get a full descriptioninformation about how different garbage collectors for young gen I mean ParNew, DefNew, PSYoungGen for old gen PSOLdGen, ParOldGen, ConcurrentMarkSweep work. Cant believe that this information is not available to the users.p  p2 The question regarding the Parallel Compacting Collector algorithm ParOldGen or Parallel MarkSweepCompact. The whitepaper see the first question has a description of its work. Let me paste a quote from the whitepaper please, spend a minute to take a look on it img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comeYCtK.png altenter image description herep  pThe things I cannot understand are listed belowp  pRegarding strongsummary phasestrongp  ul liblockquote   pDue to compactions from previous collections, it is typical that some   portion of the left side of each generation will be dense, containing   mostly live objects. The amount of space that could be recovered from   such dense regions is not worth the cost of compacting them.p blockquoteli ul  pwell, does it mean that when we have a region which consist of 9899 of live objects and 21 of dead objects in other words a very small percentage of the dead objects than compacting of this region is not worth the space that could be recovered from such a region.  However this tiny free spaces holes will be eventually filled up and there will be no holes after garbage collections is finished.p  ul liblockquote   pSo the first thing the summary phase does is examine the density of   the regions, starting with the leftmost one, until it reaches a point   where the space that could be recovered from a region and those to the   right of it is worth the cost of compacting those regions.p blockquoteli ul  pwell, if we have a big percentage of the dead objects than this region is worth compacting, rightp  ul liblockquote   pThe regions to the left of that point are referred to as the dense   prefix, and no objects are moved in those regions.p blockquoteli ul  pand no objects are moved in those regions, but there might be some little free spaces in those regions, am I right Cant uderstand the pointp  ul liblockquote   pThe regions   to the right of that point will be compacted, eliminating all dead space.p blockquoteli ul  pplease clarify how they will be compacted. Every region will be compacted separately I guess no. So maybe some kind of shifting will be herep  ul liblockquote   pThe summary phase calculates and stores the new location of the first    byte of live data for each compacted region.p blockquoteli ul  pto understand it I need to understand the previous question I suppose.p  pRegarding strongcompaction phasestrongp  ul liblockquote   pIn the compaction phase, the garbage collection threads use thebr   summary data to identify regions that need to be filled, and thebr   threads can independently copy data into the regions. This produces a    heap that is densely packed on one end, with a single large emptybr   block at the other end.p blockquoteli ul  pI am totally confused. So no compaction happened on the summary phase Was the previous phases purpose only to find all free spacesp  pstrongPlease help me to get a clear picture.strongp

Negative 724 pIm trying to use CUDA code inside MATLAB mex, under linux. With the whole program compilation mode, it works good for me. I take the following two steps inside Nsightp  p1 Add fPIC as a compiler option to each .cpp or .cu file, then compile them separately, each producing a .o file. p  p2 Set the linker command to be mex and add cxx to indicate that the type of all the .o input files are cpp files, and add the library path for cuda. Also add a cpp file that contains the mexFunction entry as an additional input.p  pThis works good and the resulted mex file runs well under MATLAB. After that when I need to use dynamical parallelism, I have to switch to the separate compilation mode in Nsight. I tried the same thing above but the linker produces a lot of errors of missing reference, which I wasnt able to resolve.p  pThen I checked the compilation and linking steps of the separate compilation mode. I got confused by what it is doing. It seems that Nsight does two compilation steps for each .cpp or .cu file and produces a .o file as well as a .d file. Like thisp  precodeusrlocalcuda5.5binnvcc O3 gencode archcompute35,codesm35 odir src M o srctnmatrix.d ..srctnmatrix.cu usrlocalcuda5.5binnvcc devicec O3 gencode archcompute35,codecompute35 gencode archcompute35,codesm35  x cu o  srctnmatrix.o ..srctnmatrix.cu codepre  pThe linking command is like thisp  precodeusrlocalcuda5.5binnvcc cudart static relocatabledevicecodetrue gencode archcompute35,codecompute35 gencode archcompute35,codesm35 link o  test7  .srccubase.o .srcexpbpwsjdevmex.o .srctnmain.o .srctnmatlabhelper.o .srctnmatrix.o .srctnmatrixlibdev.o .srctnmatrixlibhost.o .srctnmodelwsjdev.o .srctnmodelwsjhost.o .srctnutility.o   lcudadevrt lmx lcusparse lcurand lcublas codepre  pWhats interesting is that the linker does not take the .d file as input. So Im not sure how it dealt with these files and how I should process them with the mex command when linkingp  pAnother problem is that the linking stage has a lot of options I dont understand cudart static relocatabledevicecodetrue, which I guess is the reason why I cannot make it work like in the whole program compilation mode. So I tried the followingp  p1 Compile in the same way as in the beginning of the post.p  p2 Preserve the linking command as provided by Nsight but change to use shared option, so that the linker produces a lib file. p  p3 Invoke mex with input the lib file and another cpp file containing the mexFunction entry. p  pThis way mex compilation works and it produces a mex executable as output. However, running the resulted mex executable under MATLAB produces a segmentation fault immediately and crashes MATLAB. p  pIm not sure if this way of linking would cause any problem. More strangely, I found that the mex linking step seems to finish trivially without even checking the completeness of the executable, because even if I miss a .cpp file for some function that the mexFunction will use, it still compiles. p  pEDITp  pI figured out how to manually link into a mex executable which can run correctly under MATLAB, but I havent figured out how to do that automatically under Nsight, which I can in the whole program compilation mode. Here is my approachp  p1 Exclude from build the cpp file which contains the mexFunction entry. Manually compile it with the command mex c.p  p2 Add fPIC as a compiler option to each of the rest .cpp or .cu file, then compile them separately, each producing a .o file. p  p3 Linking will fail because it cannot find the main function. We dont have it since we use mexFunction and it is excluded. This doesnt matter and I just leave it there.p  p4 Follow the method in the post below to manually dlink the .o files into a device object filep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17278932cudasharedlibrarylinkingundefinedreferencetocudaregisterlinkedbinarycuda shared library linking undefined reference to cudaRegisterLinkedBinaryap  pFor example, if step 2 produces a.o and b.o, here we dop  precodenvcc gencode archcompute35,codesm35 Xcompiler fPIC dlink a.o b.o o mexdev.o lcudadevrt codepre  pNote that here the output file codemexdev.ocode should not exist, otherwise the above command will fail.p  p5 Use mex command to link all the .o files produced in step 2 and step 4, with all necessary libraries supplied.p  pThis works and produces runnable mex executable. The reason I cannot automate step 1 inside Nsight is because if I change the compilation command to mex, Nsight will also use this command to generate a dependency file the .d file mentioned in the question text.

Negative 724 pI have ajQuery UI accordion latest version on Windows and want to drag its entries to another accordion. Using draggable and droppable jQuery UI plugins it works without problems.p  pBut as soon as I make the accordion draggable it loses all its key shortcuts eg.

Negative 724 pIve been messing around with galleries. Specifically using javascript to change the width and the height when the picture is clicked on.

To use the Adc clock based on system clock     Im using 32MHz FRCPLL when the Mcu is awake and to change to ADRC internal clock before it goes to sleep, so that adc will be sampling in sleep mode.     In this way,I hope, I can wake the module by setting ADC interrupt priority greater than CPU priority,when the threshold is higher.     But for this Ive to continuously sample using adc.pli lipProvide the same Adc input to the comparator module and put the Mcu in sleep mode while not processing and turn off adc. Module can wake up     when the input is higher than comparator threshold and starts the adc. I think, in this case, comparator will be working in sleep mode.     But Im afraid that I may miss some important signal information as it will take time to turn ON adc after the comparator interrupt.pli lipAnother is to sample adc at specified intervals using a timer, but as the signal is random, it may miss the signal.pli ol  pWhich will be better or is there any other solution for this Please help me....

Negative 724 pI have this iOS game where the frog jumps from lily pad to lily pad.

When the frog lands in the middle of a lily pad and bounces it doesnt look bad, but at times the frog will simply touch the sides of the lil pad and the bounce method will be called because the rectangles intersected. I tried codeCGRectContainsRectcode but it made the game to hard, because it delayed the speed of the game. So Im not sure how to fix it. Any suggestions p
Negative 724 pAre there any examples of using encryption to encrypt the diskcache used by OkHttps a hrefhttpsgithub.comsquareokhttpblob21a96ebokhttpsrcmainjavacomsquareupokhttpHttpResponseCache.javaL51 relnofollowHttpResponseCachea Naively, I dont think this is a very hard thing to do, but Id appreciate any advice or experience to avoid securitypitfalls.p  pWithout too many specifics, heres what Im trying to achieve a server that accept users apikeys typically 40character random string for established service X, and makes many API calls on the users behalf. The server wont persist users apikeys, but a likely use case is that users will periodically call the server, supplying the apikey each time. Established service X uses reasonable ratelimiting, but supports conditional ETag, IfModifiedSince requests, so serverside caching by my server makes sense. The information is private though, and the server will be hosted on Heroku or the like, so Id like to encrypt the files cached by HttpResponseCache so that if the machine is compromised, they dont yield any information.p  pMy plan would be to create a wrapper around HttpResponseCache that accepts a secret key  which would actually be a hash of half of the apikey string. This would be used to AESencrypt the cached contents and keys used by HttpResponseCache. Does that sound reasonable p

Negative 724 pA SCORM Question regarding how I invoke Rollup macro in Saba.p  pI have a SCORM manifest which contains two SCOs. The second is only available when the first is completed by having a preConditionRule similar to the SCORMRustici Golf Examples.p  pWhen a Delegate is successful with the first SCO I set cmi.completionstatus to completed and cmi.successstatus to passed. The second SCO is a test so I set cmi.score.raw, cmi.score.scaled and cmi.completionstatus to completed.p  pAs I have a 0.8 in the second SCOs primaryObjective the Saba LMS is able to evaluate a test status of passed or failed on exit of the test.p  pWhen I exit this Learning, Saba displays that strongbothstrong SCORM Items have been passed and completed. However, the Content Attempt Status is always Suspended. This initially pointed to some of my JS interactions as I was using cmi.suspenddata to store some info on a SCO. Even though this is disabled and even when I have a single unrelated SCO, the Suspended Status is still set.p  pSo, I still dont seem to get a Rollup never seen one and it is somehow to do with this Suspended State I am somehow setting or not resolving.p  pOne question is whether I should be setting cmi completionstatus and successstatus in my interactions with the SCORM API at Object Level cmi.objective.n.successstatus rather than cmi.successstatus or both Ive tried both but am not certain which is right. I think it may depend on the Manifest.p  pHas anyone managed to get Saba to Rollup Set Learning Assignments Completion Status so it no longer displays Not Evaluated in this wayp  pMy Manifest file seems ok, the Saba Players Table of Contents shows the green light for each completed SCO in the Package but until I resolve the Status of Suspended, I am a little stuck.p  pI cmi.exit both SCOs in the normal way.p  pI am using Pipwerks Wrapper on this too but it seems to be ok.p  pDoes this all point to the API, to the Manifest or to something Im not setting up on Sabap  pThanks.p

Basically, I put a Bitmap into a BitmapDrawable which I set to be inside of a LayerDrawable into an ImageView, and the dimensions of the BitmapDrawable seem to become corrupted as soon as I put it inside the LayerDrawable.p  pIve tried adjustViewBounds paired with setting the max widthheight, changing the gravity makes the image tiny  perhaps something wrong when I loaded the image and setting the bounds to no avail.p  pThanks for any help you can provide.p  pXML layout filep  precode        ltImageView             androidididplayerHand             androidcontentDescriptionstringplayerHand             androidadjustViewBoundstrue             androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent             androidlayoutheightwrapcontent             androidmaxWidthdimenlHandWidth             androidmaxHeightdimenlHandHeight             androidscaleTypecenterInside             androidlayoutalignParentBottomtrue             androidlayoutalignParentLefttrue             androidlayoutmarginBottom220dp             androidlayoutmarginLeft150dp             androidsrcdrawablefirsthand gt codepre  pfirsthand.xml p  precode    ltitem       androidididfh1 gt     ltbitmap androidsrcdrawablecardempty         androidgravitycentergt     ltitemgt  ltitem     androidleftdimenlCardOffsetOne     androidididfh2 gt     ltbitmap androidsrcdrawablecardempty         androidgravitycentergt     ltitemgt codepre    pCodep  precode     private void dealCard aCard, int cardIndex, boolean player      LayerDrawable theHand  null     ImageView ldView  null      Unrelated code     ldView  ImageView findViewR.id.playerHand, Player hand     theHand  LayerDrawable ldView.getDrawable      Unrelated code          final int cardOffset  int getResources.getDimensionR.dimen.lCardOffsetOne    cardWidth is calculated, using the aspect ratio, from a card height of 100dp       a constant stored in my R.dimens file,     if terminalCard      ldView.setMaxWidthcardWidth  cardOffset  cardIndex    else       ldView.setMaxWidthcardWidth  cardOffset  MAXHANDSIZE 1        Bitmap aBitmap  GraphicsLoader.getBitmapaCard        Log.vdealcard, int,boolean, Loaded card bitmap height            aBitmap.getHeight  , width             aBitmap.getWidth        This lists height 259, width 208, which is the correct aspect ratio.

Negative 724 pI want to use the server side speaker notes of reveal.js so that I can use other devices to switch slides while my presentation is running on my laptop. I followed a hrefhttpsgithub.comhakimelreveal.jsinstallationthe instructions on reveal.js github pagea and now have a full installation.p  pI am able to use the speaker notes on my laptop without a problem. So I tried the server side speaker notes a hrefhttpsgithub.comhakimelreveal.jsserversidespeakernotesfollowing these instructionsa. Thus when I run the server and go to localhost1947 using a browser a popup opens which looks like the normal speaker notes page. I now have three problemsp  p1 My notes do not show up in the popup page. Even though they did in the normal speaker notes page.p  p2 If i sweep through slides in the popup page they dont change in the main pagep  p3 The Upcoming section in the popup page doesnt update. But it did in the normal speaker notes.p  pIm using an ubuntu 13.10 64bit system. I have node.js v0.10.26, express 2.5.8 and grunt  v0.4.4 installed. I also installed socket.io usingp  precodesudo npm install socket.io codepre  pCould this be some compatibility issue or is it me whose doing something wrong Ive never worked with node.js or socket.io so Im not sure where to look. p  pEDITp  pI add a minimal example here. Though in order to use it you need to put it in index.html in reveal.js directory and install plugins usingp  precodenpm install codepre  pthen in order to run it enter this commandp  precodenode pluginnotesserver codepre  pyou also need to have node.js and grunt installed. after running you can open the slides from localhost1947.

I would need to query all the item first, then use linq to object to create my tuples.p  pSolution 3  I can create a viewmodel or a new model that would represent the data i need. I know this would work but i dont understand where it would stand between the two. If it is not a view model, this information wont go to the view it an other way to see an item with only the current information.  In short, there are probably many solutions to this problem, but i need help to understand which solution would be the best and why.p

Negative 724 pI need to make fields with autocomplete for my custom forms. Its just a dropdown menu with matched cities, countries etc. I also use djangocities for that. So, I subclassed AutocompleteModelBase. Here, I can declare searchfields attribute with list of fields from model, on which the search will be applied. But what if I want to search not by the fields, but by, for example, info from related managers In djangocities, there is special related manager for socalled alternative names. It returns queryset with names for some geo object in  foreign languages. Something like this codeCountry.objects.getcodeUS.altnames.filterlanguagedecodep  pSo, I need to search by the results of such operations. Not by the fields of the model, but by translated names, which dont belong to actually fields. Thanks.p

Negative 724 pIve been working on this for last few days and am unable to get a proper implementation idea. I have a cordova android app in which I need the following p  ol liSend a push notification to the mobile based on a set of defined geofences.li ol  pFor the Geofences, I thought I can use Cordova Geolocations WatchPosition method. Using this, whenever there is a change in position and when that position matches my Geofence, the mobile should receive a push notification. I understand that using Watchposition I can get latitude and longitude values but how to check the geofences radiusp  pFor push notifications I have a cordova plugin a hrefhttpsgithub.comphonegapbuildPushPlugintree2de525365bcc2391ad8d0a399ef4662e83ac0474 relnofollowherea p  pI need to know how to integrate this push notification to a geofence using watchPosition in Cordova. Or kindly let me know is there any other way to implement this.p  pI checked something in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17138380pushnotificationstogcmwithgeofencingparametersSO herea but there is no luck.p

So I have a folder that contains 6 will increase batch files, and I want to use a for loop to iterate through the list.  An easier way of understanding it would be like sop  precodefor batchFile in folder   CALL batchFile   cd Desktop codepre  pEach batch file should start after the other finishes.  Also, batch files will be the only type of files in the folder, so there shouldnt need to be any kind of separation.  It may sound odd, but both the call and the directory change need to be inside of the loop due to directory changes in each of the batch files. This is the closest thing Ive found for getting a start on thisp  precode for r i in DIR do CALL codepre  pWhere DIR is the folder directory.  However, it 1 doesnt work and 2 would only do a CALL and not also a directory change.  Does anyone know how to do thisp  pAlso, Im using Windows 7.p  pThanks.p  pEXTENSIONp  pDoing this in a bat file will workp  precodeCALL WelcomeScreenLists.bat cd directory CALL WelcomeScreenLinks.bat cd directory CALL RightClick.bat cd directory CALL RibbonButtons.bat cd directory pause codepre  pdirectory is the full path of the folder containing the bat files.  I would like to turn this into a for loop that loops through all files in the folder.p

Negative 724 pI just started working on an Angular app that uses flot to plot a bunch of data. It worked fine for static data, but once we got the directive wired up to mongo, I had to follow the tutorial a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13103671howtointegrateflotwithangularjsherea to get it working for updating data. I had a hell of a time for one specific reasonp  pThis is my directive HTMLp  precodeltdiv classpanelbody datangcontrollerflotChartCtrlgt   ltdiv dataflotlinechart datadatarevenueData.data dataoptionsline1.options stylewidth 100 height 300pxgtltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pand javascriptp  precode.directiveflotLineChart, [     function           return             restrict A,             scope                  data ,                 options              ,             link functionscope, elem, attrs                 var chart  null                  var options   ...                   scope.watchdata, functiondata, oldData                      ifchart                          chart  .plotelem, data, options                         elem.show                      else                          chart.setDatadata                         chart.setupGrid                         chart.draw                                                                  ] codepre  pAs you can see in the html, Im using the codedataoptionscode attribute to pass the line1.options object into the directive. When I was just using static data and not using codengmodelcode or the codewatchcode function, this worked and the codescope  options  code assignments were correct. However it seems that whenever I set emanythingem on the scope outside codelinkcode, it breaks the codewatchcode. codewatchcode always receives a codedatacode of undefined... and my scope.options are also undefined. Outside of the codewatchcode function codescope.optionscode is correct, but that doesnt help me much if I cant use them when the data is actually plotted.p  pIve had to resort to hard coding the options inside codelinkcode and commenting out the outer scope assignments. I have a bunch of different charts I need to create, all of which look differently. Id hate to have to hard code different options for EVERY one, but at the moment I dont see any other way to make this work. Is there some way I can access my other data attributes from the HTML inside the codewatchcode function without it breaking everythingp  pNote I tried codeattrs.optionscode, but that just gives me a line1.options string, and not the actual object.p  pEdit1p  pUpdated my code per ExpertSystems suggestions. No longer using codengmodelcode. codescopecode is still not available inside watchp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comh2q77.png altProof that scope isnt defined inside watchp
Negative 724 pI have created a page which allows clients to change the background color. For example, 5 background colors are offered to be chosen and some buttons are made for changing the background color. The server will save what background color the clients chose in the database so that they will see the background color they chose without any setting when they visit the page again. When the client clicks the button, a AJAX request will send to the server and the PHP script will query and update a row in the database to record the choice of the client.p  pActually, I have done the page and nothing goes wrong if the client does not change the background color so frequently. For example, if I click to change from red to blue to green to white in 4 seconds evenly, the 3 changes are recognized and finally the white will be saved in the database. However, if I do that again in a very period, say, less than 1 second, I find that some updates failed. In details, I check it by if codestmtgtaffectedrowscode returns 0 and, for instance, it may show the updates corresponding to green and white has affected rows 0.p  pIf some updates failed, the last background color the client chose may not be saved. Also, it is strange to limit how fast the client can change the background. Hence, I wonder the reasons cause the problem.p  pDoes it reach fastest update frequency Or, is it because the last update is still writing the data and locking the row Can MySQL receive the update queries and make them into a queue, and process them sequentiallyp

Negative 724 pI am facing an issue regarding flip animation in 4.4.3 KITKAT in nexus 5. It was good when OS was 4.4.2 but after updating my nexus to 4.4.3 animation suffers.I am using flip animation over a layout which contains a webview and a rotating icon.

Negative 724 pI am working on a open source tool zabbix and it works very fine on RHEL Global Zone of Solaris 10. But the problem seems confusing when I try to run this tool on a sparse zone of Solaris 10. On the sparse zone, the tool works sometimes and sometimes it crashes with SIGSEGV signal. This signal is raised while freeing up the memory allocated by a variable.p  pPlease see below the exact codes where this signal is raisedp  precodevoid    freerequestAGENTREQUEST request      int i      zbxfreerequestgtkey      for i  0 i lt requestgtnparam i         zbxfreerequestgtparams[i]     zbxfreerequestgtparams      requestgtnparam  0  codepre  pPlease be informed that this part of code runs flawlessly on Linux or any Global Zone of Solaris 10.p  pNow, you might point that may be zbxfree is trying to free some variable which is already free. I would say, NO. because I have debugged the code and found that the allocation of the variable was legitimate before zbxfree tried to free the variable and consequently raised SIGSEVG signal.p  pYou may want to look into the macro codezbxfreerequestgtkeycode It is a macro but function.

Negative 724 pI am having a tough time understanding the type and use of the name of the array in C.

Thus, making codeacode look like a strongpointer to an integerstrong.

The Web Service one is for Customer IDs If I start my page with the web service and put in a number for the ID it works and gives me all of the information but if I try to do it in my actual asp.net form then nothing happens when I type in a number to for my search criteria. Also, for the Web Method from the code behind doesnt seem to find anything for me when I type a letter...... Im wondering if I am missing a reference or something that is making my actual web page not fetch the data or am I just doing it wrong as this is my first time using this.p  pI am using Visual Studio

Negative 724 pI have been running Ubuntu for quite some time, but due to the fact that Ubuntu gets more and more unstable for each new release, I decided to try Fedora once again Have not used it since FC4. For the most part, everything is working fine, and a lot more stable. But SELinux can really make once life a living hell. p  pIn Ubuntu, when I wanted to install and setup my PHP Web Server, I just told the package manager to install Apache, MySQL, PHP and phpMyAdmin. During the install configuration, I was prompted with things like MySQL passwords etc. and once the installation was done, everything was working out of the box. All I needed to do, was just to change my web directory and I was ready to work. p  pIn Fedora, not so much. Configuring MySQL needs a manual call to a binary, services needs to be manually started and enabled and so on. Okay, I can deal with that. But for some reason, I cannot log into phpMyAdmin. There is no error messages or nothing, the page just refreshes. Also changing my web directory gives me a lot of popups from SELinux, and even after fallowing their solutions, I get a new popup for each new subdirectory that I enter. p  pMy Web Folder is placed in a Dropbox folder on a secondary drive, mounted in mediaStorage. All content in that folder And subfolders have readwrite access for both my user and the group users which I have also added to my own user account as the primary group. The global UMASK is set to 002 and the httpd user has also been added to users and in the httpd config, users is set as the primary group. With SELinux off, I can access all content just fine. p  pSo how do I setup SELinux to allow httpd access to everything in my web folder  And why cant I login to phpMyAdmin The MySQL server has been started, PHP Sessions has been set to be stored in tmp and I changed the permissions in tmp to 0777, just to eliminate any session issues.p

I shy away from javascript and JQuery because i havent learnt that yet and am still trying to master css and html. p  pI cant upload a picture because i lack the reputation, but could you perhaps show me a right path on how to code this Thank you very muchp

Negative 724 pIm working on implementing a custom graph view.  The design calls for the graph to have a margin of 11 pts on the left and the right, there are 25 blocks of equal width, and the spacing between the blocks is 2.  Not surprisingly this lays out and looks pretty much perfect on iPhone 5s and below. Using autolayout the system correctly finds that each block should be 10x10. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.compR52Y.png altenter image description herep  pThings break down however when moving to the 6 and 6.  For instance on the 5 some frames are calculated with a width 12 and 12.5.  This is what I get from the 6.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comQEDtZ.png altenter image description herep  pBy manually doing the math and applying the ratio of the new screen sizes the widths dont come out to be integers but what autolayout comes up with is pretty far off.  I have some ideas on how to work around this but Im not quite sure how to do it.  Here is the code that is laying out my 25 columnsp  pvar columns  Arrayp  precode    var lastAddedColumn UIView     for index in 0...numberOfColumns  1          let column  GraphColumnframe CGRectZero         column.numberOfRectangles  10         column.setTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraintsfalse         self.addSubviewcolumn         columns.appendcolumn          if let lastColumn  lastAddedColumn              self.addConstraintsNSLayoutConstraint.constraintsWithVisualFormatH[v1]2[v2], options NSLayoutFormatOptions.allZeros, metrics nil, views dictionaryOfNameslastColumn,column             self.addConstraintNSLayoutConstraintitem column, attribute .Width, relatedBy .Equal, toItem lastColumn, attribute .Width, multiplier 1, constant 0                  self.addConstraintsNSLayoutConstraint.constraintsWithVisualFormatV[v1], options NSLayoutFormatOptions.allZeros, metrics nil, views dictionaryOfNamescolumn          lastAddedColumn  column           let firstColumn  columns.first     let lastColumn  columns.last      self.addConstraintNSLayoutConstraintitem firstColumn, attribute .Left, relatedBy .Equal, toItem self, attribute .Left, multiplier 1, constant 1     self.addConstraintNSLayoutConstraintitem lastColumn, attribute .Right, relatedBy .GreaterThanOrEqual, toItem self, attribute .Right, multiplier 1, constant 1 codepre  pThe approach Im using is to loop from 125 creating a column each time.  That column is pinned 2 pts to the right of the column before it and given a width equal to the one before as well.  Finally I pin the first and last to the left and right of the superview.  The superview is added to the scene via the storyboard and is pinned 11 pts to the left and right of the superview.p  pWhat I think might work is to have the margins be flexible but Im unsure of how to accomplish this.  I tried lowering the 11 pt let and right priorities and using less than or equal but that didnt work. Really what Im trying to get autolayout to do is do the equal width thing and if its unable to find equal widths then it should push out the margins until can do so.  I think whats holding me up is that the system is reporting that it can satisfy the constraints when in reality it cant.p

Negative 724 pOut of nowhere, earlier this week, I started running into a codeStackOverflowExceptioncode in our ASP.NET MVC application. Weve been developing this application for 2 years. Im the only developer of 3 developers who is seeing this problem. Ive been struggling to get a good stack trace and I finally got one and it turns out that its happening completely outside of our code. The exception is in the codeJsMinify.Processcode and codeMicrosoft.Ajax.Utilitiescode areas of the code. Im completely stumped. We werent even aware that any minification was taking place. Ive never noticed any of our scripts being minified when debugging in the browser. But thats neither here nor there. Im stumped. I have no clue how to fix this. Im hoping some of the brilliant folks here can give me a hand.p  pThe codeStackOverFlowExceptioncode doesnt happen every time, but it might happen 20 times in a row and then the app may work fine for a while and then it starts happening again. Its brought my productivity to a screeching halt. I dont debug from VS.NET. I deploy to a regular IIS Server and then I manually go to the site in the browser. When I do, I get the codeStackOverflowExceptioncode before anything really comes up. We have an codeApplicationStartcode and codeApplicationAuthenticateRequestcode in our codeGlobal.asax.cscode and these get called. We also have a codeApplicationEndcode which does not get called if the codeStackOverflowExceptioncode happens.p  pMy stack is below taken from WinDbg. Ive cut it off as, obviously, its huge, but you can see, its the chain of 3 methods that are getting called recursively until it dies. Im perfectly satisfied with disabling minification if thats a possibility, but Id rather solve it properly if I canp  precode0465db94 079d6e3b

disable JavascriptCSS minification in ASP.NET MVC 4 Betaa  The solution is to disable the minification. That avoids the codeStackOverflowExceptioncode, but Id like to fix the actual cause of the codeStackOverflowExceptioncode so we can at least benefit from what minification does take place. I now see why not all of our stuff is minified, which is nice to know.p
Negative 724 pSo in my web view controller pertaining to the UIWebViewNavigationTypeLinkClicked part, I have override methods.p  pSome pointing to urls which fire a download manager, and one part pertaining to a image view controller, in which it loads the image and allows me to save it.p  pIt is held in a navigation controller just as my whole app is.p  pThe first time I tap a image it loads fine, the previous view doesnt open the image as I have called [webView stopLoading].

Negative 724 pI am trying to create a maze that consists of Nodes objects. Each Node object has a member variable precodeNode attachedNodes[4]codepre that essentially contains all of the attached Nodes that will later tell the program the options it has when it is doing a breadth first search. Every time I think that I understand pointers, another issue like this comes up, and I feel lost all over again. Especially since it was working fine as far as I knew until I changed something that I thought was unrelated. Anyways, here is where the issues arep  pMy Node object looks like thisp  precodeclass Node  public     ...     void attachNewNodeNode newNode, int index     ... private     ...     Node attachedNodes[4]     ...  codepre  pMy function to attach the Nodes looks like thisp  precodevoid NodeattachNewNodeNode newNode, int index      attachedNodes[index]  newNode  codepre  pAnd then lastly, the part of the other function that is calling the attachNewNode function looks like thisp  precodeint mazeIndex  0 while inStream.peek  EOF      int count  0     Node n     Node m     ...         if SystemisNodename2              m  SystemfindNodename2                  else              m  Nodename2             maze[mazeIndex]  m             mazeIndex                  Node temp         temp  m         n.attachNewNodetemp, count The error usually happens here, but I added the rest of the code because through debugging it is only consistently in this whole area.         count          n.setNumberUsedcount  codepre  pSorry that this got a little lengthy, but Ive been searching all over this portion that I have provided trying to figure out what is wrong, but it would be nice to have someone that knows a little more about pointers give their input on the matter. The Node class was given to me, but everything else I made, so basically any of that could be changed. Thanks in advance for the help.p

Negative 724 pHi currently im using Openerp 6.0 GTKClientp  pDo you guys have any idea about how to create a session for GTKClient in openerp 6.0 The reason of why i want to create is because of i want to ask system rollback the whole process while the connection from client to server was lost.p  pi already tried some of error handling, suchp  ul liIOError for broken pipe and connection resetli lisocket.errorli lirpcsessionli lietcli ul  pbut all of them was not working. thats why i was thinking of create a session for GTKClient.p  pDo you guys think it is possible to create a session for GTKClient in openerp 6.0 If not, do you guys have any idea for handled connection lostp  pBefore i have posted a question for a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26585582createsessioninopenerpgtkclient60Create session in openerp gtkclient 6.0a, there got a replied. But because the file was expired, so i cant see the solution.p  pThanks beforep
Negative 724 pIve been doing some research here and there on the internet, and I think I almost understand how the codethiscode keyword operates. My question is When is codethiscode a necessary functionp  pI know that it is useful for distinguishing between an Objects private instance variable and another variable that its being set to if they have the exact same name. Examplep  precodepublic class SomeObject      private int someNum     public SomeObject      public setSomeNumint someNum          this.someNum  someNum       codepre  pI also learned from the second answer a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions577575usingthekeywordthisinjavausingthekeywordthisinjavaa that it is used for accessing a nested class. Although I have yet to try this out, it appears to be a pretty cool idea.p  pHow this question came to be about I am writing a codeclasscode that defines game characters from a bunch of attributesp  precodepublic class Charact      private String name      A ton of other private variables that represent character stats.     public Charact   This one is for the main character.     public CharactString name, All of the other variable parameters   This one is used for making NPCs.         this.name  name          Setting of all of the other variables.              public String getName return name     public void setNameString name this.name  name      All of the other getter and setter methods.  codepre  pSo heres a few questions about my code that are tangential to my initial question p  pIs calling the setter methods with a this, like in codethis.setVariablevariablecode, superfluous because it would do the same thing as codesetVariablevariablecodep  pI specifically declared all of my private instance variables with an uppercase letter, allowing me to avoid the use of codethiscode in my setters. Is it alright for me to do so am I breaking any normal naming conventions or should I have ought to use lowercase variable names and codethiscodees in the settersp  pDoes using codethiscode somehow help identify which instance of a class is being referred to, or is it already implicit to the computer, meaning that codethiscode is not really neededp  pAny answers that can offer some depth of elaboration would be very helpful, as Ive only started making nonstatic classes this last week. Also, this is my first question, so I am sorry if it doesnt really seem to be asked in the right formatting.p

Ive also tried to get epub files to show up with the file chooser intent codeIntent.ACTIONOPENDOCUMENTcode, but no luck.

Negative 724 pI have set my codeappDelegatecode class as the delegate for codeCLLocationManagercode. In the codedidUpdateLocationscode method of the delegate, I create a polyline. I add the polyline to the map view using code[self.firstViewController.currentMap addOverlayself.polyline levelMKOverlayLevelAboveRoads]code. However, it has no effect on the actual instance of my map view because it thinks that codeself.firstViewController.currentMapcode is codenilcode. Is there a way to somehow pass the instance of the map to codedidUpdateLocationscode so that it adds the overlay to the existing instance of the codeMKMapViewcodep

Negative 724 pHoping someone can help me. Ive tried numerous variations of triggers Ive found but cant seem to get the result Im after. Ive only been able to get this to work for a single record but fails on multiple. I know its wrong but Ill post the code just so it doesnt look like Im trying to get someone to build the trigger for me. p  pHere is the scenario. I have a product, location and stock table. What I want to do is automatically add the product number to the stock table with a balance of 0 after a new product is entered. But it needs to have a record for each location so Lets say location East and West for now but could be more added. That way when the location has stock arrive they can update their stock as is goes in and out. p  pHere is what I have now. p  precodeUSE [TestInventory] GO SET ANSINULLS ON GO SET QUOTEDIDENTIFIER ON GO  ALTER TRIGGER [dbo].[BalanceUpdate] ON [dbo].[Parts] FOR INSERT AS  declare PartNumber varchar50 declare Balance smallint  0 declare Location smallint  SELECT Location  Select ID from Location Select PartNumber  PartNumber from inserted   Insert into StockBalance  PartNumber, Location, Balance ValuesPartNumber, Location, Balance codepre  pOf course that fails because of the multiple location ID records.

Negative 724 pIm currently looking into developing a mobile app using Microsoft Azure as my backend. So far everything that I have needed is pretty much built right in.p  pAnyway, the app I am making is a messaging app that has multiuser chatrooms. Ive never done any backend programming and now I have to learn everything at once.p  pI looked at Azure documentation and noticed the Azure Service Bus feature may be what Im looking for, but Im not sure if this is the best way to do implement such a service.p  pObviously I want a way for users to synchronously and asynchronously receive messages. Synchronously while they are actively using the app on their phone and asynchronously while it is in the background load new messages from the queue when the app becomes active again.p  pThe service bus has strongTopicsstrong which I understand allows a publishersubscriber type messaging architecture, however I believe clients still have to query the Topic queue send a request to receive data. This is not ideal because I dont want to just hardcode a loop that queries the cloud service bus every second or so to achieve a psuedorealtime chat... This would probably inflate server costs as my userbase grows.p  pThe service bus also has strongRelaysstrong which I understand to allow twoway communication between a service bus and a client as well as enables synchronous messaging that builds on the publishersubscriber architecture of Topics Relays are combined with Topics, right.p  pAdditionally, each chatroom can have its own Topic, and users that join said chatroom subscribe to the Topic.p  pWhat I think I could do is I could have the app connect to the service bus via a relay while the user is actively using the app its in the forefront and the user will receive realtime chat. When the user locks the phone or otherwise puts the app into the background, I can terminate the Relay connection and when the user reloads the app, I can download messages from the queue that were not received already.p  pI want to know if service buses are recommended for this kind of messaging or if I have the idea behind them all wrong. What would you recommend for this kind of service Im open to other ideas but Id rather keep the serverside stuff rather light. I have a lot of frontend to learn alreadyp  pThanksp  pDonp

Negative 724 pOur solution was recently upgraded from .NET Framework v3.5 to v4.5.2 and as a result we have had some overflow errors running on Windows Server 2012 64bit machines.p  pThese overflow errors seem to be coming from any instance where we call this function from the Windows APIp  precode[DllImportuser32.dll, CharSetCharSet.Auto] public static extern IntPtr SendMessageIntPtr hWnd, int msg, int wParam, IntPtr lParam codepre  pThe overflow was happening because for lParam in some instances, for whatever reason, it was being passed an int instead of an IntPtr even though the function expects an IntPtr.p  pWhat was interesting was these issues only manifested after upgrading .NET and ONLY on Windows Server 2012 64bit machines.p  pIm trying to decipher the cause for this only happening under these circumstances, and also trying to find an effective way to find where other instances of this kind of overflow error could occur.p  pMy first thought was to look for all instances where SendMessage was being called, but this could miss some other instances where IntPtr is being misused. My other idea was to use either ReSharper or FXCop to detect these sort of instances and alert me to them, but I dont know how or if this is possible and by default ReSharper isnt giving any complaints.p

Negative 724 pMy program is using LibUSB to communicate with a USB device, which has buttons and LEDs, which is used to send info to the device and read info from the device. The communication is done in byte arrays, up to 1024 long, but pretty much only the first 8 bytes matter. When reading, we read the byte array, and I want to display which button was pressed or LED was lit up.

I can play with it a bit more not searching over the entire DF but reducing the field of search to indexes that werent changed thus far. Still SLOW. p  pThere is the option of group by that does exactly what I want, finding all unique pairs of combinations of the two columns and its relatively fast, but I havent figured out how to access the index of the original DF for each group.

Is it possible it was moved, renamed, or deleted But the filename it prints is the one I want it to open, and all I have specified is the prefix I want and the file extension, so it would seem to me like its finding it just fine if it knows the full file name. Also if I put in a message box between declaring the filename variable and starting the Do While loop, the message box prints the correct filename that I want it to open.p  pIf I save a new file into the folder and name it something like AA.xls, and then just have the program loop through the folder rather than specifying the prefix, and then go back and specify the prefix, it works just fine, and continues to work until I close the program and reopen, where the process starts all over. However, this process only works if I save a new file to that folder. If I try to leave the AA.xls file in the folder, I get the same error with that file that I get with the others.p  pThanks for any inputp

Negative 724 pI am currently writing a website that will eventually be used as a standalong application.  As a result, I created an MVC application and handle the login through a form.  It then redirects to another page which is essentially all the user will see for a while.  Until the rest of the application is completed, this entire website will be viewed by the users within a WPF applications WebBrowser control as part of that application.  p  pSince the user must log in to the WPF application, I would like to keep them from having to log in twice.

However, when the WebBrowser displays, it shows the error page with p  blockquote   pThe required antiforgery cookie   RequestVerificationTokenL1NjaGVkdWxlci5XZWI1 is not present.p blockquote  pSince I never load the initial page with the AntiForgeryToken, this is expected.  However, I was wondering if there were a way around this issue.  For example, is there a way to silently load the form and post it without the user seeing it  Or, am I stuck just removing the AntiForgeryToken for now until the site is no longer used within WPFp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 724 pSending a GCM notification to a hardcoded codeInstanceIDcode seems to always work for all of my androidios devices, but sending it to a topic has issues.p  pEven after a successful subscription to a codetopiccode, a device could not receive notifications from that topic, while other devices work. Looks like there is a chance that an InstanceID for a device will just not work when subscribed to a topic. Resubscribing does nothing. Deleting this token and getting a new one seems to fix that issue.p  pNote once a device associated with an InstanceID starts receiving notifications from a topic, it seems to consistently work. If it does not receive a notification that it should, it does start working later.p  pNote 2 by works, I mean that the InstanceID device receives the notification as expected.p  pWhats going on How am I ever supposed to handle this issue Is topic messaging unusablep

Negative 724 pI have a Pandas DataFrame with some columns and 221 rows. Lets say the columns of interest are codecol1code and codecol2code. codecol1code has all strings, while codecol2code is all integers. Now I want to eliminate rows where codecol1  A amp col2  1code.p  pIt is rather easy to get a boolean vector with codeTruecode corresponding to all rows that meet the condition. In order to delete them, I thought if I could invert the boolean vector have codeFalsecode where the the condition is met, I can just index my DataFrame with the inverted vector and be done.p  pIn the process I have, I think made an interesting discovery List comprehension is faster than numpy invert method for a boolean vector. The length of the vector in question is 221.

But, is there an even faster way to do this I will have to run this on a much larger DataFrame in the near future. Thanks for your helpp
Negative 724 pI need your helpp  pSo I have a users and a pages table in my mysql database.

Negative 724 pI am supporting a Legacy .Net Entity Framework application. This app makes uses of Pluralization for the table names.p  pI am introducing a new data itemtable name Media.p  pHowever, Entity Framework is incorrectly pluralizing this to Medias.p  pHow can I turn off pluralization on a pertable basisp  pIve done a bit of research so far, but the only material Ive found refers to turning pluralization on and off for the entire data set.

Negative 724 pSo I only very recently started with the concept of Vue or React, JS libraries that are the view layer of your app. Now I started building a tiny little test app with Vue that has video lists, theyre simply lists of videos. However, every video list has a different source from my own JSON API, so one list might request apiv1related related videos for video with ID 1 and one might be a general apivpopular for the most popular videos.p  pNow all these lists have the same HTML markup, it looks something like thisp  precodeltul classvideolist iduniqueIdentifiervideolistgt     ltli vrepeatvideos classrowgt         lta href classimagewrappergt             ltdiv stylebackground url thumbnail center backgroundsize covergtltdivgt         ltagt         ltdiv classinfowrappergt             lth4gt                 lta hrefgt title ltagt                 ltsmallgt length ltsmallgt             lth4gt             ltp classvideodescriptiongt desc ltpgt         ltdivgt     ltligt ltulgt codepre  pYou can see me implementing Vue with  repeat, the videos are coming dynamically from a backend. You can see me grabbing the thumbnail, title, length and the description. I created a bunch of dummy videos that are returned by the API, an example video response looks like this in JSONp  precode   title Cool example video,   desc This video is about very interesting things and such,   length 025,   thumbnail httpsunsplash.it1280720image50  codepre  pThe HTML markup is the same on every page, so thats one point of repetitioncode duplication, but the much mroe important one are the Vue instances.p  pSo for each of these lists I have mostly the same behavior, the list is a Vue instance that is bound to the unique ID and it fetches the videos using vueresource, puts them in the videos property and that powers the list. It looks like thisp  precodevar uniqueVideoList  new Vue     el uniqueIdentifiervideolist,      data          videos []     ,      ready function          this.fetchVideos     ,      methods          fetchVideos function              this.http.getapivpopular, functionvideos                  this.videos  videos                             codepre  pPretty much this exact code, the Vue instance, I have copied for each and every video list on the site. So I have the HTML markup and JavaScript copied for every instance, the HTML is the exact same and the JS is apart from the single endpoint it needs to hit.p  pWhat could I do to fix this Thanks.p

Negative 724 pIve recently started learning Python. My apologies if this is really obvious.p  pI am following along with the 2008 MIT open course on Computer Science and am working on the problem of calculating the 1000th prime integer.

Given the starting codenumcode is three, I figured it would be easy enough to simply change codenum1code to codenum2code. Of note I wont bore you with the detailed code I composed, but while writing this I was using a very verbose mode of printing out the results of each check, whether or not it was prime, which number was being checked, which integer divided into it if it wasnt prime amp such again, sorry  newBp  pAt this point I became curious to test if this was actually taking less time to compute  seemed like if half the numbers are being checked for primacy, it should take half the time, nop  pI imported the time module to check how long this was taking. Computing to the 1000th was pretty quick either way so I increased the number of primes I was searching for to the 10,000th and didnt see any significant difference. between codenum1code amp codenum2codep  precodeimport time start  time.time  num  3 primeList  [2]  while lenprimeList lt 10000     for i in primeList         if num  i  0             break     else         primeList.appendnum     num  2  print The 10,000th PRIME integer is, primeList[9999] end  time.time print That took .3f seconds  endstart codepre  pSometimes the coden2code even took a couple milliseconds longer. . I thought this was odd and was wondering if someone could help me understand why  or, more to the point howp  pFurthermore, I next imported the sqrt function thinking this would reduce the number of integers being checked before confirming primacy, but this doubled the runtime O.p  precodeimport time start  time.time  from math import sqrt  num  3 primeList  [2]  while lenprimeList lt 100000     for i in primeList         if i lt sqrtnum             if num  i  0                 break     else         primeList.appendnum     num  2  print The 100,000th PRIME integer is,primeList[99999] end  time.time print that took, end  start, seconds, or, endstart60, minutes codepre  pCertainly  it might be the way Ive written my code If not, Im curious what exactly I am invoking here that is taking so longp  pThank youp

Negative 724 pWorking on a part of my code now that deals with summing up core data objects and I created most of the code related to it as best as I could but it is only summing up one of the many sums I want to do related to this Entity. I have tried repeating the lines to cast for totalLosses as well but only 1 or the other presents. I also want to sort these out by a NSPredicate to get specific strings that contain these totals as well. The current means I have created wasp  precodefunc fetchSumTotals   let expressionDesc  NSExpressionDescription expressionDesc.name  SumofTotalWins expressionDesc.expression  NSExpressionforFunction sum, arguments[NSExpressionforKeyPath totalWins] expressionDesc.expressionResultType  .DoubleAttributeType and then a fetch request which fetches only this sum  let fetchRequest  NSFetchRequestentityName CombinedResults fetchRequest.propertiesToFetch  [expressionDesc] fetchRequest.resultType  .DictionaryResultType  var error  NSError if let results   managedObjectContext.executeFetchRequestfetchRequest, error amperror      let dict  results[0] as [StringInt]     let SumofTotalWins  dict[SumofTotalWins]     printlnSumofTotalWins     overallWins.text  SumofTotalWins.description  else  printlnfetch failed error.localizedDescription   codepre  pnot sure what I am missing exactly but I know this is close. I plan on sorting out my winsCount based on the opponentsclass which has a string attribute. Basically I am trying to sum up the total wins of the opponents class then sorting the total losses by opponentsclass right now it is summing up only the total wins of the objects. I am basically looking for a way to sum up multiple core data attributes and have it actually break down how they got the primary total with the individual totals. I was also thinking of making this a class itself that can be called in viewcontrollers for simplicity in coding. Is this possiblep

Negative 724 pIm having trouble getting the main feature of my iOS application to work. Im trying to create an app that measures the amount of movement over a period of a few hours using CoreMotion. All works fine when the device is awake, however the issue is that the device auto locks after a while and enters the background state, thus my methods for monitoring movement pause.p  pIm searching for a possible solution to recording the devices movement whilst it has been locked, which may be to keep the app awake for a few hours at a time. Ive looked into a bunch of possible solutions that have been used for this in the past, yet found out that these ways of doing it can now cause the app to be rejected by Apple.p  pAny help would be much appreciated please.p
