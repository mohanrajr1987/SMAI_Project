Positive 245 pI should preface this post by saying that I am a very elementary developer with a generic IS degree. Without going into too much detail, I was given a moderately large web application from an interning software engineer to support an enhance if need be. It was written primarily in Python, JavaScript and HTML5 and utilizes a Google Map API to visually represent the location and uses of given inputs. This leads me to my question.p  pThere is a date picker modal that the applicationuser utilizes. They pick a START and END date, in the default format YYYYMMDD if the user does not use that exact format i.e. 20150929 the date picker will not work, and the application then goes to the DB and picks the given inputs between those dates and represents them on the map. I have been told that, for usability, I have to make the program accept multiple date formats i.e. September 29 2015, 09292015, 9292015, 9292015. How would I go about doing thisp

Negative 245 pIm in the process of designing a system which connects to one or more stream of data feeds and do some analysis on the data than trigger events based on the result. In a typical multithreaded producerconsumer setup, I will have multiple producer threads putting data into a queue, and multiple consumer threads reading the data, and the consumers are only interested in the latest data point plus n number of points. The producer threads will have to block if slow consumer can not keep up, and of course consumer threads will block when there are no unprocessed updates. Using a typical concurrent queue with readerwriter lock will work nicely but the rate of data coming in could be huge, so i wanted to reduce my locking overhead especially writer locks for the producers. I think a circular lockfree buffer is what I needed. p  pstrongNow two questionsstrongp  ol lipIs circular lockfree buffer the answerpli lipIf so, before i roll my own, do you know any public implementation that will fit my needpli ol  pAny pointers in implementing a circular lockfree buffer are always welcome.p  pBTW, doing this in C on Linux.p  pstrongSome additional infostrongp  pThe response time is critical for my system. Ideally the consumer threads will want to see any updates coming in as soon as possible because an extra 1 millisecond delay could make the system worthless, or worth a lot less.p  pThe design idea Im leaning toward is a semilockfree circular buffer where the producer thread put data in the buffer as fast as it can, lets call the head of the buffer A, without blocking unless the buffer is full, when A meets the end of buffer Z. Consumer threads will each hold two pointers to the circular buffer, P and Psubnsub, where P is the threads local buffer head, and Psubnsub is nth item after P. Each consumer thread will advance its P and Psubnsub once it finish processing current P and the end of buffer pointer Z is advanced with the slowest Psubnsub. When P catch up to A, which means no more new update to process, the consumer spins and do busy wait for A to advance again. If consumer thread spin for too long, it can be put to sleep and wait for a condition variable, but im okay with consumer taking up CPU cycle waiting for update because that does not increase my latency Ill have more CPU cores than threads. Imagine you have a circular track, and the producer is running in front of a bunch of consumers, the key is to tune the system so that the producer is usually runing just a few step ahead of the consumers, and most of these operation can be done using lockfree techniques. I understand getting the details of the implementation right is not easy...okay, very hard, thats why I want to learn from others mistakes before making a few of my own. p

Negative 245 pIve been tackling this for a while. I setup a completely new machine. Ive installed a fresh copy of postgresql and all my other dependencies. Basically, I get these database disconnections at random times. I can perform identical requests and either it works or it doesnt. Very nondeterministic in outward appearance. Watching logs at Postgresql, it doesnt even get a connection. Now, I would expect that if it never connected I would get this problem when establishing the connection and getting the cursor, but I get it when trying to actually use the connection later. Given the traceback below, I would expect to see a connection made in the pg logs, and then disconnected for some reason later. I dont, so I wonder if there is some clue in that mismatch.p  precodeTraceback most recent call last   File usrlocallibpython2.6distpackagesDjango1.1py2.6.eggdjangocorehandlerswsgi.py, line 242, in call     response  self.getresponserequest   File usrlocallibpython2.6distpackagesDjango1.1py2.6.eggdjangocorehandlersbase.py, line 73, in getresponse     response  middlewaremethodrequest   File usrlocallibpython2.6distpackagesDjango1.1py2.6.eggdjangomiddlewarelocale.py, line 16, in processrequest     language  translation.getlanguagefromrequestrequest   File usrlocallibpython2.6distpackagesDjango1.1py2.6.eggdjangoutilstranslationinit.py, line 97, in getlanguagefromrequest     return realgetlanguagefromrequestrequest   File usrlocallibpython2.6distpackagesDjango1.1py2.6.eggdjangoutilstranslationtransreal.py, line 349, in getlanguagefromrequest     langcode  request.session.getdjangolanguage, None   File usrlocallibpython2.6distpackagesDjango1.1py2.6.eggdjangocontribsessionsbackendsbase.py, line 63, in get     return self.session.getkey, default   File usrlocallibpython2.6distpackagesDjango1.1py2.6.eggdjangocontribsessionsbackendsbase.py, line 172, in getsession     self.sessioncache  self.load   File usrlocallibpython2.6distpackagesDjango1.1py2.6.eggdjangocontribsessionsbackendsdb.py, line 16, in load     expiredategtdatetime.datetime.now   File usrlocallibpython2.6distpackagesDjango1.1py2.6.eggdjangodbmodelsmanager.py, line 120, in get     return self.getqueryset.getargs, kwargs   File usrlocallibpython2.6distpackagesDjango1.1py2.6.eggdjangodbmodelsquery.py, line 300, in get     num  lenclone   File usrlocallibpython2.6distpackagesDjango1.1py2.6.eggdjangodbmodelsquery.py, line 81, in len     self.resultcache  listself.iterator   File usrlocallibpython2.6distpackagesDjango1.1py2.6.eggdjangodbmodelsquery.py, line 238, in iterator     for row in self.query.resultsiter   File usrlocallibpython2.6distpackagesDjango1.1py2.6.eggdjangodbmodelssqlquery.py, line 287, in resultsiter     for rows in self.executesqlMULTI   File usrlocallibpython2.6distpackagesDjango1.1py2.6.eggdjangodbmodelssqlquery.py, line 2369, in executesql     cursor.executesql, params   File usrlocallibpython2.6distpackagesDjango1.1py2.6.eggdjangodbbackendsutil.py, line 19, in execute     return self.cursor.executesql, params OperationalError server closed the connection unexpectedly         This probably means the server terminated abnormally         before or while processing the request. codepre

Negative 245 pBefore I describe my problem, here is a description of the program IHExplorer.exe Im writtingp  pThis is a C application.p  pThe IHExplorer application is to look as much like a Windows Explorer window as possible. With one exception, and that is that launching files from within this Explorer window will decrypt them first to the users temp folder, then launch the app associated with the file extension and delete the file on close.p  pThe problem im having is with the auto delete when the file is closed.  Heres a scenariop  ol liUser double clicks an encrypted .txt file in IHExplorer.li lipIHExplorer decrypts the .txt file in memory, then writes it to TEMP using CreateFile which returns a HANDLE to the file IHExplorer has to keep this handle open atleast until the .txt file is shell executed.pli lipIHExplorer Shell Executes the .txt file by calling ShellExecute from its temp location.pli liNow IHExplorer and notepad both have a handle to the file open.li liThe file must be auto deleted when both IHExplorer and notepad have both closed their handle to the file, even if IHExplorer closes first.li ol  pok. that is a basical User Case that describes what I want to happen.  The problem I have is when I ShellExecute, notepad says The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process. which would be IHExplorer.

Negative 245 p[ this is getting TLDR...sorry... ]p  pI work on a huge mostly CMFC application with hundreds of DLLs it supports a dynamicallyloaded add in mechanism via COM, thus addins can be developed in .NET by using COM interop. Some limited new functionality is developed in .NET wo using this addin mechanism although still dynamically loaded however, the end user can decide to not use this feature.  Thus, .NET might not be loaded at startup.p  pBut, when .NET strongisstrong loaded, I need to do some .NETspecific initialzation specifically setting emCurrentUICultureem to match the nativeunmanaged UI.p  pOne solution is to simply punt and do this .NET initialization when the code gets around to loading either the new .NET functionaliy or COM addins.  Given the nature of this applicaton, it is probably a 95 solution most users will be using the new functionality.p  pBut its not foolproof.  Somebody could readily add new .NET functionality at any time by building a module with the strongclrstrong flag remember, this is a huge application.p  pOne more robust and obvious solution is simply cause .NET to be loaded at startup via CCLI.  But some of the diehard C developers to whom every byte and clock cycle matter dont want to do this somewhat understandable as theres no need to set emCurrentUICultureem unlessuntil .NET is loaded.p  pAnother possibility I thought of is to hook codeLoadLibrarycode and look for strongmscorlibstrong.  Now I know .NET is about to be loaded for some reason, load it in the normal manner and do the initialization before the other code does anything.  But hooking codeLoadLibrarycode or anything else, for that matter really isnt something I want to do.p  pSo, is there an easyierbetter way to tell if .NET about to be loadedp  pstrongEditstrong Reeds answer of emLockClrVersionem is pretty darn close.

Negative 245 pIm attempting to implement a hrefhttpgraphics.cs.williams.edupapersEdgesNPAR04index.html relnofollowthis papera. Ive have most of it down, but the part about sending arbitrary, nongeometric data to the shader for use in determining and displaying geometric edges is causing me problems. Ive managed to successfully send most of my data just fine using what I know of VBOs. However, I need to send a large amount of data, which necessitates the use of multiple texture coordinates.p  pIve already implemented several variations of what I believe to be the correct way of setting up multiple sets of texture coordinates, and followed the instructions of many forum posters. No solutions work thus far.p  pFor context, the program is sending 4 nearly identical copies of a set of 4 vertices, 2 normal vectors, a float, and an integer stored as a float for each unique edge in the model. Ive laid out the data like thisp  precodev0 is stored in glVertex vec3 v1 is stored in glColor vec3 v2 is stored in glMultiTexCoord0 vec3 v3 is stored in glMultiTexCoord1 vec3 n0 is stored in glNormal vec3 n1 is stored in glSecondaryColor vec3 r and i are stored in glMultiTexCoord2 vec2 codepre  pThe only difference between the 4 copies is the i value, which helps determine how to organize the vertices if and when a drawable edge is found.p  pAs you can see, I need at least 3 texture coordinates. I was able to get the first one working glMultiTexCoord0 just fine, but any following texture coordinates, though on the graphics card, appear to have uncontrollable behavior, sometimes working, but usually not.p  pMy rendering function used to look like thisp  precodevoid MeshRenderLineEdgesGPU   Enable client state glEnableClientStateGLVERTEXARRAY glEnableClientStateGLNORMALARRAY glEnableClientStateGLCOLORARRAY glEnableClientStateGLSECONDARYCOLORARRAY glEnableClientStateGLTEXTURECOORDARRAY   Turn on edge shader edgeProgram.Activate   Link buffers  v0 glBindBufferARBGLARRAYBUFFERARB, edgeMeshHandles[0] glVertexPointer3, GLFLOAT, 0, 0   v1 glBindBufferARBGLARRAYBUFFERARB, edgeMeshHandles[1] glColorPointer3, GLFLOAT, 0, 0   v2 glClientActiveTextureARBGLTEXTURE0ARB glBindBufferARBGLARRAYBUFFERARB, edgeMeshHandles[2] glTexCoordPointer3, GLFLOAT, 0, 0   v3 glClientActiveTextureARBGLTEXTURE1ARB glBindBufferARBGLARRAYBUFFERARB, edgeMeshHandles[3] glTexCoordPointer3, GLFLOAT, 0, 0   n0 glBindBufferARBGLARRAYBUFFERARB, edgeMeshHandles[4] glNormalPointerGLFLOAT, 0, 0   n1 glBindBufferARBGLARRAYBUFFERARB, edgeMeshHandles[5] glSecondaryColorPointer3, GLFLOAT, 0, 0   r and i glClientActiveTextureARBGLTEXTURE2ARB glBindBufferARBGLARRAYBUFFERARB, edgeMeshHandles[6] glTexCoordPointer2, GLFLOAT, 0, 0   Indicies glBindBufferGLELEMENTARRAYBUFFERARB, edgeMeshHandles[7]   Draw glDrawElementsGLPOINTS, EdgeVertexQuantity, GLUNSIGNEDINT, 0   Turn off edge shader edgeProgram.Deactivate   Disable client state glDisableClientStateGLVERTEXARRAY glDisableClientStateGLNORMALARRAY glDisableClientStateGLCOLORARRAY glDisableClientStateGLSECONDARYCOLORARRAY glDisableClientStateGLTEXTURECOORDARRAY  codepre  pThis was my original one. It definitely works for v0, v1, and v2. It appears to work for r and i, but that could be an illusion. I dont have the ability to test n0 or n1 yet. v3 definitely DOES NOT work. As you can see, Im drawing them as points, which tells me if they are there or not via the shader. v0, v1, and v2 are all there. Attempting to do the same for v3 yields either a single point at the origin or nothing at all.p  pAfter looking at suggestions online, heres my new setupp  precodevoid MeshRenderLineEdgesGPU   Enable client state glEnableClientStateGLVERTEXARRAY glEnableClientStateGLNORMALARRAY glEnableClientStateGLCOLORARRAY glEnableClientStateGLSECONDARYCOLORARRAY   Turn on edge shader edgeProgram.Activate   Link buffers  v0 glBindBufferARBGLARRAYBUFFERARB, edgeMeshHandles[0] glVertexPointer3, GLFLOAT, 0, 0   v1 glBindBufferARBGLARRAYBUFFERARB, edgeMeshHandles[1] glColorPointer3, GLFLOAT, 0, 0   v2 glClientActiveTextureARBGLTEXTURE0ARB  glEnableClientStateGLTEXTURECOORDARRAY glActiveTextureARBGLTEXTURE0ARB glEnableGLTEXTURE2D  glBindBufferARBGLARRAYBUFFERARB, edgeMeshHandles[2] glTexCoordPointer3, GLFLOAT, 0, 0  glDisableGLTEXTURE2D glDisableClientStateGLTEXTURECOORDARRAY   v3 glClientActiveTextureARBGLTEXTURE1ARB  glEnableClientStateGLTEXTURECOORDARRAY glActiveTextureARBGLTEXTURE1ARB glEnableGLTEXTURE2D  glBindBufferARBGLARRAYBUFFERARB, edgeMeshHandles[3] glTexCoordPointer3, GLFLOAT, 0, 0  glDisableGLTEXTURE2D glDisableClientStateGLTEXTURECOORDARRAY   n0 glBindBufferARBGLARRAYBUFFERARB, edgeMeshHandles[4] glNormalPointerGLFLOAT, 0, 0   n1 glBindBufferARBGLARRAYBUFFERARB, edgeMeshHandles[5] glSecondaryColorPointer3, GLFLOAT, 0, 0   r and i glClientActiveTextureARBGLTEXTURE2ARB glBindBufferARBGLARRAYBUFFERARB, edgeMeshHandles[6] glTexCoordPointer2, GLFLOAT, 0, 0   Indicies glBindBufferGLELEMENTARRAYBUFFERARB, edgeMeshHandles[7]   Draw glDrawElementsGLPOINTS, EdgeVertexQuantity, GLUNSIGNEDINT, 0   Turn off edge shader edgeProgram.Deactivate   Disable client state glDisableClientStateGLVERTEXARRAY glDisableClientStateGLNORMALARRAY glDisableClientStateGLCOLORARRAY glDisableClientStateGLSECONDARYCOLORARRAY  codepre  pNotice how Ive done the codeglEnableClientStatecode  codeglDisableClientStatecode calls around the actual loading of each texture coordinate list. I also use codeglActiveTextureARBcode and codeglEnableGLTEXTURE2Dcode. While I think I might understand why codeglActiveTextureARBcode is needed here, the other one baffles me. According to the a hrefhttpwww.opengl.orgwikiGLSL5F3A5Fcommon5FmistakesEnable5FOr5FNot5FTo5FEnable relnofollowGLSL Common Mistakes pagea, youre not supposed to use codeglEnableGLTEXTURE2Dcode when you make your own shaders, since the use of shaders ignores this call anyway.p  pSo thats it. Ive gotten this far without being able to find any tutorials specifically addressing how to send nontexture coordinate data in texture coordinates. Perhaps if someone knows a tutorial on that, my problem would be alleviated. Thanks for your timep

Negative 245 pwhat is the best way to choose for managing textbinary content on filesystem Typically when building web applications with a lot of multimedia binaries and other various text based content stored on filesystem, JDK 6 java.io is still too much low level. p  ul liIt will change with java 7 as you can see a hrefhttpjava.sun.comdevelopertechnicalArticlesjavasenio relnofollowherea thanks to new java.nio.file. packageli ul  pBut until java 7 is out and implemented by IDEs etc., I really dont know what to use for this, except of org.apache.commons.io.

Negative 245 pIm serializing the data in my app using custom serialization i.e. each of the classes Im storing has the code[Serializable]code attribute and implements codeISerializablecode.

Negative 245 pTheres this cool feature in the UITableViews in Game Center and the search bars they have at their tops. Unlike apps where the search bar is placed in the table header view so it counts as a standard table cell, instead, it seems to be bolted to the parent navigation bar above it.  So when scrolling the table, the search bar does indeed move, but if you scroll above the boundaries of the table, the search bar never stops touching the navigation bar.p  pDoes anyone know how this might have been done I was wondering if Apple maybe placed both the search bar and the table in a parent scroll view, but Im wondering if it may be simpler than that.p

Negative 245 pIm writing a program in linux to interface, through serial, with a piece of hardware. The device sends packets of approximately 3040 bytes at about 10Hz. This software module will interface with others and communicate via IPC so it must perform a specific IPC sleep to allow it to receive messages that its subscribed to when it isnt doing anything useful. p  pCurrently my code looks something likep  precodewhile1   IPCsleepsometime   readserial   processserialdata  codepre  pThe problem with this is that sometimes the read will be performed while only a fraction of the next packet is available at the serial port, which means that it isnt all read until next time around the loop. For the specific application it is preferable that the data is read as soon as its available, and that the program doesnt block while reading.p  pWhats the best solution to this problemp

However, on the planner page, I get errorsp  blockquote   pMessage Missing argument 1 for Studentplannerp      pMessage Undefined variable datap      pMessage Invalid argument supplied for foreachp blockquote  pIm quite sure I get these errors because the function somehow doesnt receive the codedatacode array.

If we request all invoices in January, after got paid invoices in the first quarter, the client entityset will contains all the records only, if all invoices are paid in January. p  pSo I thought, its more efficient to get the number of objects on the server first, and then download the EntitySet if needed.p  pAnybody has a better solutionp  pThanks in advance, p  pGabor.p

It logs messages in a SQL database that I can view via a website no problem, but what I want is to be able to control the C program and call methods remotely via the website in the browser too.

Negative 245 pAccording to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3130336howarearraysimplementedinperlthis questiona and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3130336howarearraysimplementedinperl31303703130370this answera, lists are implemented as arraysp  blockquote   pPerl implements lists with an array   and firstlast element offsets. The   array is allocated larger than needed   with the offsets originally pointing   in the middle of the array so there is   room to grow in both directions   unshifts and pushesinserts before a   reallocation of the underlying array   is necessary. The consequence of this   implementation is that all of perls   primitive list operators insertion,   fetching, determining array size,   push, pop, shift, unshift, etc.   perform in O1 time.p blockquote  pSo you would expect accessing an element by a numeric offset would be just as fast because theyre arrays in the implementation, which provide very fast constanttime indexing. However, in a footnote in a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick0596520107emLearning Perlema, the author saysp  blockquote   pIndexing into arrays is not using   Perls strengths. If you use the pop,   push, and similar operators that avoid   using indexing, your code will   generally be faster than if you use   many indices, as well as avoiding   offbyone errors, often called   fencepost errors. Occasionally, a   beginning Perl programmer wanting to   see how Perls speed compares to Cs   will take, say, a sorting algorithm   optimized for C with many array index   operations, rewrite it   straightforwardly in Perl again, with   many index operations and wonder why   its so slow. The answer is that using   a Stradivarius violin to pound nails   should not be considered a sound   construction technique.p blockquote  pHow can this be true when a list is really an array under the hood I know its simply ignorant to try to compare the speed of Perl to C, but wouldnt indexing a list by offset be just as fast as pop or push or whatever These seem to contradict each other.p

Negative 245 pSo, Im at somewhat of a loss right now and hoping someone can help.  I have a function defined in a library called listfree which, as you can imagine, frees a list that you created earlier.  When I call this function from within another module, my program segfaults.  When running GDB though, I getp  precodegdb bt 0  GIlibcfree mem0x65656853 at malloc.c3709 1  0x0804f279 in listfree  2  0x0012ffef in setvar ... at srccalcmodel.c337 3  0x0804b320 in testdependencyupdates i0 at srcteststestcalc.c63 4  0x080507ea in srunnerrunall  5  0x0804d2b9 in main  at srcteststestall.c19 codepre  pThus, the line that caught my attention was 1 ... there is no reference to the source of that function.  When I change the name of the function from codelistfreecode to codelistfreexcode i.e., just something different no more segfault.  The other strange thing is if I change the name in the .c file, I get no warning of an undefined reference to listfree or whatever error I would get from forgetting to link in a library.p  pThus, Im led to believe that the function is being defined elsewhere, but I have no idea where.  A codegrep R listfree .code offers no help and the gdb output doesnt seem to indicate otherwise.p  pSo Im wondering if anyone has any tips on how to hunt down where this function might be defined.  Also, Ive renamed the function as noted above for now as I dont seem to have any other choice ... but Im not sure if this is a goodsafe idea  Ie, could I just be masking other problems by doing sop  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 245 pI am writing an iPad app that presents user documents similar to the way Pages presents them as large icons of the actual document.  I also want to mimic the jiggling behavior when the user taps the edit button.  This is the same jiggle pattern that icons make on the home screen when you tap and hold on them on both the iPhone and iPad.  p  pIve searched the Internet and have found a few algorithms but they just cause the view to rock back and forth which is not at all like the Apple jiggle.  It seems there is some randomness in there as each icon jiggles a little differently. p  pDoes anyone have or know of some code that can recreate the same jiggle pattern or something very close to it  Thanksp

Negative 245 pThis is not the same old question about the validators and update panel compatibility.p  pHeres my scenariop  pI have a aspx page with a script manager. This page has a ascx user control with my functionality. In this control, I have a few panels and areas which will get enableddisabled or visiblehidden according to what the visitor selects by clicking on some of the radio buttons which will control this behaviour. Everything is fine until this point. Validators and UpdatePanel are not fighting against each other, however, if I try to submit the page without filling the form, I get a validation message on my summary and its all good with the validation itself.. Heres the problem, the radio buttons, which are responsible for set visibility for some areas stops working, but it starts working again after the 2nd or 3rd click. Its not delay or anything.. it just seems like the handlers are not bound to the control, then I click again, and it cleans up the summary and all error notifications and starts working again..  I dont know if it adds to the issue, but both the user control and the page have telerik controls such as combo box with load on demand, tooltips and the loading panel.. p  pI have searched a lot about it and all I could find was the question regarding the validation controls not working inside updatepanel or updatepanel not working with validators.. in this case, it actually works, I only have problems emafterem the validation has been performed and the page.isvalid is set to false.. p

Negative 245 pIm currently using a singleton as a data store for my app.  I essentially store a number of events that are pulled and parsed from a web service and then added as needed.  Each time I make a request from the web service, I parse the results and see if the items already exist.  If they do, I delete them and add the updated version provided by the web service.  p  pEverything appeared to be working properly until I fired up the Instruments panel to find out that my system is leaking the objects every time it loads them from the web service from the second time on.  The core method where things appear to be messing up is this one, which is located in my HollerStore singleton classp  precode voidaddHoller Holler h      Take a holler, check to see if one like it already exists     int i  0      NSArray theHollers  [NSArray arrayWithArrayallHollers]     for Holler th in theHollers               if [[th hollerId]isEqualToString[h hollerId]]                       NSLogRemoving holler at index i, i             [allHollers removeObjectAtIndexi]                  i          [allHollers addObjecth]  codepre  pQuick explanation I decided to copy the allHollers NSMutableArray into theHollers because its being updated asynchronously by NSURLConnection.  If I update it directly, it results in a crash.  As such, I switched to this model hoping to solve the problem, however the Instruments panel is telling me that my objects are leaking.  All the counts are exactly the  of items I have in my data set.  p  pFrom what I can tell removeObjectAtIndex isnt effectively removing the items. Would love to get the thoughts of anybody else out there on three thingsp  ol liIs my analysis correct that something else must be retaining the individual hollers being added li liShould I be using CoreData or SQLite for storing information pulled from the web service li liDo you know how long data stored in a Singleton should be available for  Until the app is killedli ol  pstrongUpdatestrong I think Ive found the source, however perhaps someone can provide some clarity on the proper way to do this.

Now, Im using Google App to sendreceive email so I created a new alias like noreplycompany.com.p  pAnd I just got a confirm email from Google that Im not allowed to use Google Server to send out email by JavaMail, because they do not support JavaMail as a mail client, the issue that Im having is Im getting AuthenticationException back from smtp.google.com.p  pMoreover, Im using Amazon EC2 to host the application as well, and amazon provides SES service to send out emails. So, the question would be can I use Google App to host our company email for every employee, but can I still use Amazon SES to send out emails by JavaMail within the same domain name as we are using with Google Apps. So, the emails that well be sending out would be noreplycompany.com but will be from Amazon SES. p  pIm not sure if Im making this clear enough, my concern would be we redirect email MX Record to Google App already, I think we cannot redirect to Google and Amazon at the same time p  pThe application we are writing is based on Grails, so the email would be from Spring Emailp  pCheers,p

Since the result of codeXamlReader.Loadcode is written directly to a PNG via a codeVisualBrushcode, it seems the necessary mechanics of WPF to invoke binding expressions are bypassed.p  pThis leads me to believe that the actual bindings arent really being invoked just by calling codeXamlReader.Loadcode, or that theyre not working because of something I dont know about to do with there not being a visual tree until you add the codeFrameworkElementcode to an existing visual tree or something.p  pIs there something I can do to ensure these bindings are invokedp  pMany thanks in advance.p

Negative 245 pI am trying to persist a large class called an Authorizer which holds a reference to a database connection and a container of other objects representing the result of a complicated set of database queries. I want to serialize the expensive to build parts of this object in a session. Then when I need to ask the Authorizer a question I want to wake the Authorizer object up instead of building a new one for each page. I am writing a custom handler to temporarily store this object in a database table. I understand that the magic method sleep is usually used to handle choosing which parts of the object to store and then wakeup is used to restore the database connection. p  pThis is where I get fuzzy. I think serialize and unserialize are supposed to work instead of the constructor and destructor, but I cant quite understand how they interact with sleep and wakeup. Then I got to the part of the manual describing the serializable interface and thought OK I will be able to implement this and be sure I have this right. Then I read that classes which implement this interface no longer support sleep and wakeup That was the only part of this whole thing I really understood  I couldnt find any examples at all of how to properly implement this interface. p  pSo my question is what is the preferred way to implement serialization in a completely object oriented system Is the serializable interface meant to replace an older method What is the purpose of having two different sets of functions emsleepemwakeup and serializeunserializep

Negative 245 pTwo points  first, the example is in Fortran, but I think it should hold for any language second, the built in random number generators are not truly random and other generators exist, but were not interested in using them for what were doing. p  pMost discussions on random seeds acknowledge that if the program doesnt seed it at runtime, then the seed is generated at compile time. So, the same sequence of numbers is generated every time the program is run, which is not good for random numbers. One way to overcome this is to seed the random number generator with the system clock. p  pHowever, when running in parallel with MPI on a multicore machine, the system clock approach for us generated the same kinds of problems. While the sequences changed from run to run, all processors got the same system clock and thus the same random seed and same sequences. p  pSo consider the following example codep  precodePROGRAM clocktest    IMPLICIT NONE    INCLUDE mpif.h    INTEGER  ierr, rank, clock, i, n, method    INTEGER, DIMENSION, ALLOCATABLE  seed    REALKIND8  random    INTEGER, PARAMETER  OLDMETHOD  0, amp                          NEWMETHOD  1     CALL MPIINITierr     CALL MPICOMMRANKMPICOMMWORLD, rank, ierr     CALL RANDOMSEEDSIZEn    ALLOCATEseedn     DO method  0, 1       SELECT CASE method       CASE OLDMETHOD          CALL SYSTEMCLOCKCOUNTclock          seed  clock  37   i  1, i  1, n           CALL RANDOMSEEDputseed            CALL RANDOMNUMBERrandom           WRITE, OLD Rank, dev  , rank, random       CASE NEWMETHOD          OPEN89,FILEdevurandom,ACCESSstream,FORMUNFORMATTED          READ89 seed          CLOSE89          CALL RANDOMSEEDputseed            CALL RANDOMNUMBERrandom           WRITE, NEW Rank, dev  , rank, random       END SELECT       CALL MPIBARRIERMPICOMMWORLD, ierr    END DO     CALL MPIFINALIZEierr END PROGRAM clocktest codepre  pWhich when run on my workstation with 2 cores, givesp  precodeOLD Rank, dev             0  0.330676306089146      OLD Rank, dev             1  0.330676306089146      NEW Rank, dev             0  0.531503215980609      NEW Rank, dev             1  0.747413828750221      codepre  pSo, we overcame the clock issue by reading the seed from codedevurandomcode instead. This way each core gets its own random number. p  pWhat other seed approaches are there that will work in a multicore, MPI system and still be unique on each core, from run to runp

The format is stored in a text file as a user input format and an answer format. p  pFor example, the text file looks like this, with user input on the left and output on the rightp  precodemy name is ltnamegt  Hi there, ltnamegt codepre  pSo if the user writes codemy name is johnnycode, I want the program to know that codejohnnycode is the codeltnamegtcode variable, and then to print the response codeHi there, johnnycode.p  pSome prodding me in the right direction would be great I have never used regular expressions before and I read an article on how to use them, but unfortunately it didnt really help me since it mainly went over how to match specific words. p
Negative 245 pive been working on a compiler for an imperative language using lex and yacc, and today i finished the grammar, the thing is that ive been reading on the web that every grammar is expected to have a few shiftreduce conflicts, specially if it has ifelse statements, thats often known as dangling ifelse, and mine does have ifelsifelse statements yet it doesnt throw any conflict when compiled, the question is p  pdoes that means this grammar has flaws just because it doesnt throw any shiftreduce conflicts i dont have much experience doing this but i cant find any problem with itp  pIn case you want some more information the productions for the ifelsifelse statements in this grammar are something like thisp  precodestatement gt ...   initialconditionalstmt  initialconditionalstmt conditionalstmt  conditionalstmt else block   conditionalstmt gt if  expression  block  conditionalstmt elsif   expression  block codepre  pblock is just a list of statements inside brackets p

Negative 245 pI have my asp.net mvc 3 application with entity framework and i used the Database First model to set it up.p  pMy Steps below  1. Genarated a database with tables  2.

Negative 245 pIn a MVVM scenario the model Impegni is created from a database table using linq2sql. A Wpf form displays all the Impegni fields and this is achieved binding the object exposed by the viewmodel, ImpegnoSelezionato of type Impegni, to the DataContext of the grid which contains all the other UI controls.  Unfortunately in the form some more fields need to be displayed and part of them may be directly derived from the model for example one of them is a boolean comparison between two model fields.  The first solution is to expose other properties in the viewmodel. Due to the DataContext set on the Grid every new control which shows the added properties on the viewmodel needs something likep  precodeDataContextBinding RelativeSourceRelativeSource ModeFindAncestor, AncestorType  xType Window, PathDataContext.ActiveWorkspace codepre  pwhich is a very odd syntax for me and I cannot believe there is no something simpler to use.p  pThe second idea I had is to create some method extensions for the Impegni model. Those methods wouldnt need any parameter and would be equivalent to the getter methods of properties.br After some net surfing it seems the only way to bind a control to a method instead of a property is to use an ObjectDataProvider  and I couldnt find out what to write in the ObjectTypexType p  pThe third idea is to regenerate the model with some more properties, but as I said before it comes from a dfatabase table using linq2sql Im a newbe and I dont know if I can add extra fields which are not on the database table.p  pSo at the time I write only the first idea has proven to be working but I would like something a bit cleaner. Any suggestions p  pThanks Filippop

Negative 245 pI am trying to refactor some delphi 7 code. One of the procedures Id like to move uses a data type called TLVColumn appears to be a TListView column header. However, if I move the method, I get an undeclared identifier error, presumedly because I didnt copy the import which defines TLVColumn to the new unit. The unit Im moving this method from has over 7000 lines of code and over 50 uses classes listed. Is there any more efficient way than trial and error of copying random imports to identify which import is required for a particular class especially imports that are from Delphi libraries and not from my own codebase...p
Negative 245 pIm trying to combine a border on an UIView with a line drawn in drawRect. I use for both the same width.

The problem I have is setting the codeHOMEcode to be dynamic I want it to point to codeDRIVELETTERPortableAppsPortableGitcode so when I generate and use my SSH keys it will go to codeDRIVELETTERPortableAppsPortableGit.sshcode p  pRight now codeHOMEcode is codecode and it makes the default path for ssh generation code.sshidrsacode which doesnt exist. I have found site that say SET IT TO codeeblablablacode but that doesnt work if the drive letter is codeJcode. p  pI have not found any good guides to setting up truly portable git.p  pThanks for any help Munchiesp

As far as I can see the Number of the IRQ and the Vector number in the Interrupt Vector are not the same because I have for example my network card registered to IRQ 8.

Negative 245 pI am confused about binding and the purpose of codebind.Allcode in backbone.js. Below is a working code that creates a Modal view codemodalcode and renders out comments fetched from the backend.p  pFirstly, in the code below, I have in the codeinitializecode function code.bindAllthis, render, renderCommentscode. Whether or not I do code.bindAllcode, I have no problems calling codethis.rendercode and codethis.renderCommentscode inside codeinitializecode. Are there any examples of when code.bindAllcode will help us and when it will notp  precodeModalView  Backbone.View.extend     el modal,      template .template tplmodal.html ,      initialize function          .bindAllthis, render, renderComments         this.render         this.renderComments     ,      render function          this.el.fadeInfast.append this.template this.model.toJSON this.model        ,      renderComments function          this.commentList  new CommentCollection         var self  this         this.commentList.fetch             data  postid this.model.id,             processData true,             success function                  self.commentListView  new CommentListView collection self.commentList                              codepre  pAndp  precodeCommentListView  Backbone.View.extend     el .modalcomments,      initialize function          this.render     ,      render function          var self  this         this.collection.each functioncomment, index              self.el.append new CommentListItemView model comment .render.el                   return this       codepre  pSecondly, I am confused about prepending codethis.code to something. For example in coderenderCommentscode, why cant I usep  precodevar commentList  new CommentCollection var self  this commentList.fetch....  codepre  pFor the line codethis.commentList  new CommentCollectioncode, other than instantiating the class codeCommentCollectioncode, does it make codecommentListcode a child of codeModalViewcodep  pAdditionally, is it necessary to have codevar self  thiscode and use codeself.commentListViewcode later in the callback function Can binding be used so  I can access codethis.commentListViewcode, or is using codevar self  thiscode the conventional way of doing thingsp  pFinally, should codeself.commentListView  new CommentListView collection self.commentList code in the success function of coderenderCommentscode be moved to codeCommentListViewcodes initialize method instead and be binded to codethis.collection.onresetcode to prevent nesting too many functions This will result inp  precodeModalView  Backbone.View.extend     el modal,      template .template tplmodal.html ,      initialize function          .bindAllthis, render, renderComments         this.render         this.renderComments     ,      render function          this.el.fadeInfast.append this.template this.model.toJSON this.model        ,      renderComments function          this.commentList  new CommentCollection         this.commentListView  new CommentListView collection this.commentList          this.commentList.fetch             data  postid this.model.id,             processData true                 CommentListView  Backbone.View.extend     el .modalcomments,      initialize function          this.collection.onreset, this.render, this     ,      render function          var self  this         this.collection.each functioncomment, index              self.el.append new CommentListItemView model comment .render.el                   return this       codepre
Negative 245 pI have a javascript app that Im developing where Im building an action tree on the fly and Ive found myself in the curious situation of wanting to purposefully introduce a circular dependency. After an initial very hacky attempt, I discovered that JavaScript variable scoping actually introduces a a pretty reasonable way to solve this. Im still no expert at JavaScript, so I wanted to get some input on best practices. Here is a snippet of working codep  precodevar Step  functiontitle, instructions, action      this.title  ko.observabletitle     this.instructions  instructions     this.action  action   var Action  functioncancelText, cancelDescription, cancelStep, nextDescription, addText, addStep, continueText, continueStep      this.cancelText  cancelText     this.cancelDescription  cancelDescription     this.cancelStep  cancelStep     this.nextDescription  nextDescription     this.addText  addText     this.addStep  addStep     this.continueText  continueText     this.continueStep  continueStep   var PersonalStep  new Step     Contact Information,     How can we contact you about your awesome assortment of vehicles Fill out the form below,     new Actionnull, null, null, null, null, null, null, null   var AddVehicleStep  new Step     Additional Vehicle,     You have another car Great, tell us about it too,     new ActionCancel,                No, nevermind about this vehicle.,                PersonalStep,                Add another vehicle,                 Add,                AddVehicleStep,  This is the weird bit to me                No, continue on,                PersonalStep       var VehicleStep  new Step     Vehicle Details,      Tell us about your primary vehicle by filling out the form below.,     new Actionnull, null, null,                Add another vehicle,                 Add,                AddVehicleStep,                No, continue on,                PersonalStep  codepre  pSo in effect, the AddVehicleStep can continuously add additional vehicles when the user chooses the Add action on the form. In most languages that Im familiar with, anyways, the AddVehicleStep variable would fail to parse from within its own constructor. This is very strange to me and I would like to learn more about this idiom of JS. Is there a better way to do object trees like this on the flyp  pIt also got me to thinking, I had been purposefully declaring my step variables in reverse order so they would be parseable. My discovery about referencing the variable in its own constructor led me to believe that this wasnt necessary. But I just tested it and if I move the AddVehicleStep var after the VehicleStep, VehicleStep gets codenullcode for its codeaction.addStepcode. Is there a way to get around this limitation and let my variables be declared in any order Would using blank declarations and later setting them work e.g.p  precodevar a var b  var a  new Stepb var b  new Stepb  a should now have the full instantiated object of b within it, right  provided the step constructor assigned it, of course codepre  pThis has probably been answered elsewhere, I just havent found the keyword to bring it up...p  pAlso, Im using these steps as part of a Knockout.js app which is essentially implementing a dialogform wizard  I hope the example code stands on its own for posing the conundrum, but in case you were curious.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I had this working in a JS fiddle last night. Turns out that there is something about how the js memory is handled between subsequent runs on jsfiddle that caused it work in the particular window I had been working in Chrome, latest version. However, opening it in a new window or new browser and it stops working.p  pThe really weird part is that I cant replicate the behavior in any browser. Maybe one of my edits had it declared differently and got it lodged in memory somehow. I really wish I could replicate it, just to prove Im not crazy...p  pThanks for the helpp

Negative 245 pI have a Grails application that needs internationalization. Grails makes it easy to translate fixed strings using the codemessages.propertiescode file, but I could not find how to translate model fields.p  blockquote   pIs there some way to manage internationalized models, so that models in multiple languages can be entered in some admin area and the correct one will be selected in the viewp blockquote  pI could roll up my own system, but maybe something of this kind already exists and it is more featured and battletested than what I would write. This had happened to me in Django I used a custom system  which I describe below  for internationalization, only to find out that various Django apps already solve this problem.p  pstrongAn example of how to solve this issuestrongp  pIf it is not clear what I am trying to achieve, here I describe the implementation I used on Django.p  pI had two base abstract models, codeI18NModelcode and codeTranslationModelcode. The actual models used in the application inherited from the former, while their translations from the latter. In inheriting, they needed to define a foreign key to their untranslated model and to define a field with the associated language.p  pThe original model, in turn, inherited a method codetranslatecode, that took a language and returned a proxy model. This proxy had a reference both to the original, untranslated model and to a translated model associated to the correct item and language.p  pWhenever you asked for a field on the proxy, it would try to find if it was defined on the translated model. If it was, it would return that, otherwise it would give as default the field on the untranslated model.p  pHooking it with a method to find the current language, I got as a result something that I could use like this in the templatesp  precodelth1gt article.translate.title lth1gt codepre  pwhile allowing editors to insert translations in the admin area.p

Negative 245 pI started working through the tutorial at a hrefhttpruby.railstutorial.org relnofollowrailstutorial.orga  to get exposure to the framework.

I can already see different concerns e.g. authentication and authorization leaking into this controller, which contains too many actions to begin with. This assigns too many actions to one controller. I stumbled upon a hrefhttpsgithub.comjonleightonfocusedcontroller relnofollowrails focused controllersa which solves one of these issues and looks quite interesting. p  pstrongIs this a common solution Or are better solutions availablestrongp  pIn the .net world, we tend to use a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiAspectorientedprogramming relnofollowaspect oriented programmingAOPa to achieve a cleaner a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSeparationofconcerns relnofollowSeparation of Concerns SoCa.

It captures the idea of a request pipeline nicely. Something that makes more and more sense to me.p  pIn order to handle a request we tend to go through a few steps before and sometimes after the action is executed. In some cases, conditionally ending the request. It seems natural to use something like behaviors, a pipeline or a russian dolls pattern.  So that each link in the chain is responsible for either continuation or cessation.

Negative 245 pI have an object that has a set mapped using ManyToMany. The set can be quite large hundreds of thousands of entires.

Any good resources on using CanvasThread would be great, or any advice on the following applet would be much appriciated. Thank youp  precodeimport java.awt. import java.applet. import java.awt.event.  public class Bounce2 extends Applet implements ActionListener, AdjustmentListener, Runnable      private final static

Negative 245 pIn the code below Id like to expose property Bristles of Hedgehog as an IBristles in the IHedgehog interface, because a that way I can just expose the getter and b in external assemblies I dont have to reference all the assemblies that Bristles uses for more complicated methods like FindBristleDNA.

Negative 245 blockquote   pstrongPossible Duplicatestrongbr   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3460280isthereawaytowakeasleepingthreadIs there a way to wake a sleeping threada  p blockquote    pI have a windows forms application in C .net. I am using namedpipes to communicate with a c application. The communication part is running fine. In the form load event, i start two background threads, one of them is for receving. The receiving thread is in infinite while loop. It sleeps when there is no data to be read and when data arrives, it reads it and then pushes it in a message queueglobally created. i want to use the other that i created when the form loaded to read the message queue and update the UI. what i want is that as soon as the second thread is created, it should go in infinite sleep and when the reading thread has read 4 or more messages, it should generate some sort of signal that wakes up the sleeping thread. then the thread processes the message queue until its empty and then goes to back to sleep until it receives another message from the receiving thread.p

Negative 245 pHere is what I got  an upload button, which works through silverlight if it is installed, or through html5 if there is no silverlight. So, I have 2 browsers to test Chrome and IE. I did common uploading by sending keys to input element and it works good in chrome, but when it comes to IE  it is trying to use silverlight.  My question is how to disable silverlight or maybe there are some workarounds I found out that it is an addon, so if somebody knows how to disable addons or launch iedriver with switches, please, let me know.p

Negative 245 pI have a very simple form with a codeRichTextBoxcode field.  It is acting as a crude log file viewer.  As log data is added to the file I append the new data to the text box.  This works great but I wanted to prevent the text box from scrolling when the new data was appended so the currently visible data could be read.  I experimented with this for a while and I ultimately had to call the native codeSendEventcode function to get and set the scroll position before and after appending the text.  This has also been working great, however, I now have a new problem over time the log file can grow quite large and use huge amounts of memory to keep the entire contents of the log file in the text box.  So now what Ive done is limited the amount of text in the text box by removing text from the beginning if the text size reaches a certain threshold.p  pSo now my problem is that I can maintain the scroll position, but the text will change since I am removing text from the beginning.  Is there a simple way to change the scroll position to maintain readability obviously if the user is reading the first line of the text box and that is removed then there is nothing that can be done, but I think that is acceptable  p  pHeres an example say my threshold is 1MB of text in the text box.  If there is currently 1MB of text, and I need to append 1000 characters then I also need to remove 1000 characters from the beginning.  If I am scrolled to the middle of the text then I can maintain that scroll position after the removal and appending of text but now the text that I was reading is further up.p  pMaybe I need to rethink my approachp

Negative 245 pThe question How to read a local resraw file line by line deals with a similar issue but I was unable to construct a solution base on the answers provided there. I did get a very useful piece of info the DataInputStream class which has a readLine method, and I have been researching this on the developer website and trying to make it work.p  pWhat I am trying to do is read information stored in successive lines of a text file into a string array, such that the first line is the first array element, the second line is the next array element, etc... and then this string array is going to be used to populate text fields in the next activity that is opened. This is all happening inside of a switch case depending on the case i.e. which list item is selected, a different text file is loaded. Here is what I have so farp  precodeRetrieve necessary text file for inputstream InputStream buildinginfo  getResources.openRawResourceR.raw.testbuilding class DataInputStream extends FilterInputStream     protected DataInputStreamInputStream buildinginfo          superbuildinginfo          TODO Autogenerated constructor stub         int i           String[] buildinginfo         Assign lines of text to array         fori0 ilt5 i             buildinginfo[i]  buildinginfo.readLine                codepre  pSo far the editor is okay with it except for these errors, and I am not experienced enough to make sense of them. I understand what they are saying but not how to fix them. The errors are in the section inside the switch case where I am trying to set up the input stream and assign the values. Most importantly, in the line where the readLine command takes place, I get  The method readLine is undefined for the type DataInputStream  The method readLine is undefined for the type InputStreamp  pThis I do not understand because if I am not mistaken, it says here a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferencejavaioDataInputStream.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comreferencejavaioDataInputStream.htmla that the DataInputStream  class has the readLine method available I found out about this from the question referred to above. Obviously I have not used the DataInputStream correctly, but I cant seem to figure out how. I have looked through several questions on here and referred to the page linked above several times. p  pIf anybody can see what I am doing wrong I would appreciate your help very much. If I am barking up the wrong tree entirely for this type of task, I apologize for wasting time, but some guidelines or a referral to an appropriate tutorial resource would be much appreciated. I have spent the last two days trying to figure out these errors.p

However, if I run the commands line by line in wish everything works properly.p

Negative 245 pI am not certain there is one correct answer to the question, but here we go. While numerous numerical problems can be stated in a linear algebra form, it seems from my limited experience that there is a performance overhead for simple operations in using Math.NET over writing equivalent operations on raw arrays.  p  pAs a test case, I wrote code to compute the distance between a vector and the closest vector in a list, with 3 versions operating on arrays, operating on dense vectors, and operating on dense vectors with the MKL provider. Working on arrays ran about 4x faster than on vectors, and 3x faster than using the MKL provider.  p  pThe downside is that I had to write by hand a distance computation, instead of leveraging the builtin Norm function. The upside is that its much faster. emNote I didnt post the code, will be happy to do so if needed, I might also be using Math.NET improperly.em  p  pSo my question is as follows it seems to me that using higherlevel abstractions comes at a performance cost. Is that in general the case, or are there situations like sparse matrices for instances where using Math.NET would be expected to outperform manually written operations on arrays  p  pIf that is the case, I would tend to think that using the linear algebra part of Math.NET would be mostly useful for real algebra that involves matrices, to avoid reimplementing more complex calculationsalgorithms, and potentially for code readability, but that for operations which are more simple vector by vector operations, it might be a better idea to work on raw arrays.  p  pAny light on when its a good idea to use the library vs. when you should roll your own would be appreciatedp

Negative 245 pSome background to help explain this difficult question firstp  pI have a database that estimates the reliability of users by comparing the values that they have submitted to a global average. Values range between 0 and 1. So, wherep  ul liReliability of this particular user  codercodeli liAverage of this particular users submitted values  codeacodeli liGlobal, agreed upon average  codegcodeli ul  pReliabilityp  precoder  1  ABSg  a codepre  pThis is how the reliability of each user is calculated. Now, the Global, agreed upon average codegcode, is calculated using a weighted mean, where the weighting is the codercode and the value is codeacode. If there are 3 users in totalp  precode  g  r1  a1  r2  a2  r3  a3  r1  r2  r3 codepre  pThe problem is, that once users have a high reliability, they have a complete monopoly, and no new values can change this. Taking an examplep  precodeg was initially 0.5 user1 r was initially 0.5 user2 r was initially 0.5 user3 r was initially 0.5 codepre  pNow, they will submit values one by one, and watch what happensp  precodeuser1 a is submitted, 1.0 user1 reliability goes slightly down because it differs from g 0.5 user2 a is submitted, 1.0 user1 and user2 reliability go up to 100, g is now 1.0. user3 a is submitted, 0.0 user3 reliability goes down to 0. g is still 1.0. codepre  pSince user3 has a very low reliability, the weighting does not have any effect at all on codegcode. User3s reliability goes down because the values submitted differ completely from the global average. What can be done to make user3s submissions have strongsomestrong effect on the final value Maybe I need to add some constant so that reliability never ends up completely zero but closep  pNow, for the SQL code.

But it seems not this way. Actually, I am trying to implement an algorithm described in a paper. The algorithm for reducer is listed below. Line 11 is the column I mentioned, and each reducer has every column of the matrix. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOndBb.png altenter image description herep

Negative 245 pI have a quick question. I have a website, with a design that responds to when a user clicks on the like button. So, I use the edge.subscribe method to list in on when the button is clicked. p  pTo do this, I had to create a facebook app, with its own facebook app id and embed the like button using the javascript api. The problem is, the like button is pointing to the facebook page  and not the website the website has 0 likes, the facebook page has 200k likes. p  pThe question is, my like button doesnt show up unless Im logged in to facebook  which seems to be an issue I had previously resolved with another website by having the page Im liking, and the page Im clicking the like button share the same App ID. p  pCan I still have the Facebook like button show up even though Its not technically pointing to a page within my app Does my page in facebook need to be an app p  pThanks, Gregp

Negative 245 pThis question is related to the a hrefhttpsgithub.comscholrlyneo4djangoissues155 relnofollowgithub issuea of Neo4django. I want to create multiple graphs using Neo4j graph DB from Django web framework. Im using Django 1.4.5, neo4j 1.9.2 and neo4django 0.1.8.p  pAs of now Neo4django doesnt support labeling but the above is my core purpose and I want to be able to create labels from Neo4django. So I went into the source code and tried to tweak it a little to see if I can make this addition. In my understanding, the file dbmodelsproperties.py has class BoundPropertyAttrRouter which calls gremlin script through function emsaveeminstance, node, nodeisnew. The script is as followsp  precodescript       nodeg.vnodeId     results  Neo4Django.updateNodePropertiesnode, propMap      codepre  pThe script calls the update function from library.groovy and all the function looks intuitive and nice. Im trying to add on this function to support labeling but I have no experience of groovy. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to proceed Any help would be appreciated. If it works it would be a big addition to neo4django p  pThank you p
Negative 245 pWe are currently running code analysis in release mode, when we run the code analysis in our dev environments, through the Visual Studio IDE  we get 2 errors p  p1 CA1506   Avoid excessive class couplingp  p2 CA1823   Avoid unused private fieldsp  pWhen we check in we have a gated check in on a build server which gets the latest sources runs units tests and Code Analysis.

The only difference is that the Build server uses the command line to run Code Analysis and not the IDE.

Negative 245 pFor an enterprise application framework im working on right now, im looking for a way to manage assets cleverly and simply from a developers perspective. Essentially, the scenario is one of applications metadata information being persisted on a relational database ie the name of the application, the different pages, the roles for that application, etc, accessed through a REST API in example, if i want to access to full application x metadata, i can navigate to applicationsx and get the representation of that application in terms of pages and components of each page.p  pThere is no code except by what we call components you may think of them as bundles of reusable cssjshtml. Now, the question is I have metadata of components on database in example, component id, component description, etc but also components code is on a file system under a versioned control system SVN in our case. Meaning that the component information is both on DB and file system.  So, if in example, some developer creates a component that is, commits code to a particular folder where components are persisted on file system i need to let the database know that there is a new component, and so it should be updated. On the other hand, if the API is used to remove a particular component something like DELETE componentscomponentId1 that would remove code on file system also.p  pSomeone would argue that code could be added as a blob to DB, but i still want to use a versioning system like SVN or GIT, so that is not an option. Also, working with code that is on a file system is much more simpler that code on a database.p  pSo, my question is if you can provide me with some ideas, approaches, etc. to know how could be implemented a solution for managing these kind of assets that lives both on a database and on a file system, and should be consumed  modified  created both from a file system and a REST api. p

Negative 245 pI have a complex class see example code below that I save in an Entity Framework Code First database V5. The problem is if a FooClass is used in the FooAndOrBar data that is saved to the database I want to stop the FooClass entry from being deleted. Because it could be null then the foreign key checks wont stop FooClass being deleted so I have to check myself.p  precode    class FooClass  ... some properties       class BarClass  ... some properties       class FooAndOrBar              public int Id  get set          public FooClass Foo  get set          public BarClass Bar  get set       codepre  pTherefore, following good practice for validating entries that cut across multiple database entries, I added a test to Entity Frameworks ValidateEntity method as shown below. p  precode    protected override DbEntityValidationResult ValidateEntity         DbEntityEntry entityEntry, IDictionaryltobject, objectgt items              if entityEntry.Entity is FooClass ampamp              entityEntry.State  EntityState.Delete                                     if ... entityEntry.Entity is used in DbContext.FooAndOrBars ...                 return new DbEntityValidationResult... error ...                   return base.ValidateEntityentityEntry, items       codepre  pThe problem is that ValidateEntity does not seem to be called on delete. That makes sense why validate something you are going to delete but leaves me with the problem of where should I put the check I do use a UnitOfWorkrepository pattern and could put a test in there, but that smells. p  pHad anyone else come across this problem and solved it in a clean way Your input would be appreciated. p  h1ANSWER FROM Pawel see below.h1  ppawel pointed out that you can override ShouldValidateEntity so that ValidateEntity is called for deleted items. Here is some example code in case someone else finds this useful.p  precode ltsummarygt  Override ShouldValidateEntity to cause deleted entities to be checked as well  ltsummarygt protected override bool ShouldValidateEntityDbEntityEntry entityEntry      if entityEntry.State  EntityState.Deleted         return true      return base.ShouldValidateEntityentityEntry  codepre  pI actually made the check a bit tighter than just all deleted items by checking for the type of the entity, but that is just to improve performance.p

The text file contains a list of the integers from 1 to 10000 in unsorted order you should treat this as a stream of numbers, arriving one by one. Letting xi denote the ith number of the file, the kth median mk is defined as the median of the numbers x1,,xk. So, if k is odd, then mk is k12th smallest number among x1,,xk if k is even, then mk is the k2th smallest number among x1,,xk. In the box below you should type the sum of these 10000 medians, modulo 10000 i.e., only the last 4 digits. That is, you should compute m1m2m3m10000mod10000.p  pThis is what I came out with...

When it gets one I need to either show a notification OR alert my main Service that theres been a new message  crucially I dont want both So I need to know whether the message was dealt with by my main Service ...p  pClearly it can be done with sendOrderedBroadcast and a BroadcastReceiver but that seems overkill for my simple private intraprocess needs.p

Negative 245 pI noticed that most TinyMCE plugins give placeholders with a simple image, and perhaps some editbuttonpopover functionality. Take the Wordpress gallery and image edit functionality as an example  a simple image with editdelete buttons. Even NextGen 2 a few versions ago at least had Nextgengallery slideshow placeholder as a simple image, not rotating image.p  pI was recently trying to make some more dynamic content within the editor. Its a challenge to insert the jQuery, then import the jQueryplugins that run certain behavior within a placeholder. Its also challenging to fix the nodragintononeditableplaceholder bug, after enabling the TinyMCEnoneditable plugin.p  pEven after that, there is a problem where the div with special content noneditable placeholder can lose its elements when it is dragdropped within other text to another part of the editor.p  pAre things like this the reason most TinyMCE plugins make a styled image, at best Is TinyMCE and a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebGuideHTMLContentEditable relnofollowcontenteditablea in general inherently incompatible with jQueryplugins running within its editors Are there any examples of successful live preview functionality in a hrefhttpsdeveloper.mozilla.orgenUSdocsWebGuideHTMLContentEditable relnofollowcontenteditable areasa, rather than a static image filep  pemstrongUpdateemstrongp  pIt looks like this isnt even a TinyMCE problem  as you can see on a hrefhttpjquery.malsup.comcycle2demobasic.php relnofollowthis demo pagea, when you add the codecontenteditabletruecode attribute to the codeidmaincode element, then select some text including the rotating banner, cut and paste to another part, it not only stops the slideshow as you would expect, it also removes several img elements. Is there any way to stop this glitchp

Negative 245 pIm working on crossplatform mobile app and as I understood Xamarin.Mobile was developed in order to increase code sharing in crossplatform applications.

Negative 245 pI recently have been working on a project where I can pull data from sites such as Google Analytics, Bing, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc. All of these sites now use OAuth 2.0 as a standard for authenticating a user. After a lot of reading and experimenting Im pretty sure I understand the basic execution and reasoning of OAuth. It seems very secure, and makes sense to have a user present to ensure that they are authorizing an app.p  pThis only leads to one hinderance  the purpose of my app is to pull data insights, generally from all of these different sources, for a given period of time, and store the data to be used for reporting. By requiring OAuth, I am then requiring a browser where the user can  input their credentials andor at least redirect to the source site to ensure that the currently logged in user has allowed access to the particular app.p  pSo far, Google seems to be the only site that allows for a browserless method of accessing data. My question is, strongwhy not othersstrong. At the very least there has got to be a way of making servertoserver requests  thus far in my journey it seems that there is literally no way to fullyautomate this. My current app is just a C console application, does anyone know of any alternatives, or even know of reasons why this isnt commonly availablep

Negative 245 pIm populating a codeToolStripMenucode with entries from an codeXMLcode file.  Each codeToolStripItemcode added to the menu automatically gets about a dozen event handlers assigned to it.  The user has the option to change the codeXMLcode and refresh the menu, which clears everything using p  precodemenuStrip1.Items.Clear codepre  pThis repopulates from the codeXMLcode and refreshes the Form.  It appears that the event handlers for all these dynamic items are never removed from memory.  Most of the items dont sit directly on menuStrip1 but in dynamically created submenus which reside on codemenuStrip1code.  p  pNevertheless, I can sit there refreshing the Form and the memory just balloons out of control, adding code510 MBcode per refresh of about code100 dynamic ToolStripItems.code  It can quickly reach hundreds of MB which crashes the application.p  pThe codeToolStripItemscode also load other things such as properties and icons, but it seems to be the event handlers which use most of the added memory.  I commented out all the handlers and the memory became far more but not completely sustainable with each refresh.p  pIs it necessary to enumerate through all the menus and submenus and individually release each event handler to assure its not sticking aroundp

We have COBOL programmers, but they have never done this.p  pWe are converting a mainframe application with a DB2 database to a .Net MVC application with SQL database. There is one mainframe COBOL batch program that we would like to call from a COBOL stored procedure on the DB2.

Negative 245 pThe layout on Android Emulator doesnt look like the layout Ive made in Android Application Project.p  pI have made a layout in eclipse with two radiobuttons and two spinners, but when I run it on Android emulator the spinners get two extra radiobutton each beside the arrow sign. Please see the images below. Moreover when I run it on my Android Phone, all four radiobuttons become black. I cant take a snapshot of the app on my Android phone while running it at the same time but the buttons become black. My project is running Android version 4.1.2 in eclipse and my smartphone has the same version as well. Any tip would be valuable for me, thank you.p  pP.S When I have only this class in a separate project, no extra radiobutton comes in the spinner. Its only when I am calling this class from a method of another class in a bigger project.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhoePl.png altlayout in eclipsep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXCCd2.png altlayout in emulatorp
Negative 245 pWhen I do php programming, I tend to edit inplace on the development server cpanel VPS, not local via a text editor that has built in sFTP. I like this because there isnt 100 thinkgs you have to do to publish the changes, you save via FTP and reload the page.  p  pI want to get the source into SVN mostly so I can track other peoples edits.p  pI currently use tortoiseSVN on my windows machine to access hosted SVN repos csvdudecodison for non web projects so Im familiar with that.  Linux SVN, not so much. p  pMy thought here open to other ideas is that I want the publichtml folder on the server to be the working copy Is there a problem with this.  People can make edits as they would via sFTP and then the working copy would be committed to the external SVN repo, possibly on a late night cron..hoping I can set it up to autoadd and commit.p  pSo aside from thoughts on the idea, Im curious how to set up the linux svn client to commit to external repos a la tortoiseSVN.  It seems all the tutorials I see set up a local repo.p  pAdditionally Im worried when I check out with publichtml dir as the working copy that it will overwrite everything. yes I have backups...p  pAny input or suggestions would be awesome..

Negative 245 pSo here is my problem,p  pI am trying to retrieve a value from a website and copy it to a database on my webserver every 15 or 30 minutes. I want to do this because the value is the number of users connected to the website and I want to see when is the best time to post content in order to get the most views possible.p  pThe problem here is that the value in question is loaded by Jquery and therefor Im unable to user DOMDocuments to get the value since it isnt initially loaded with the page itselfp  pI also tried to use Jquery to retrieve the page in order to get the value but it didnt load the value in question.p  pThen I searched for the script that filled in the number of users and found the post Jquery function that loads the value but havent been able to retrieve it. I then discovered that the external server must be configure in order to accept cross browsing p  pNow I dont really know what to try. Does any one have an idea what I could try next p  pHere is the link to the webpage containing the number of users onling a hrefhttpbit.ly1ljFkhh relnofollowbit.ly1ljFkhha  at the bottom of the list on the left sidep

The group code code70code means that an 16Bit Integer will follow, in the example its a code0code. My problem now is e.g. how can distinguish between the group code code0code and Integer code0code. In the example snippet it seems that Integer values have some special indentation, but I couldnt find anything about this in the DXF reference.p  pMy idea so far was following ANTLR grammarp  precodegrammar SimpleDXF  start          HEADER variable ENDSEC  variable       varstart groupcode NL value NL  varstart       VAR  groupcode      INT  value          INT  ANYCHARSEQ   WS             [ t] gt skip    NL             r n  HEADER         0 NL SECTION NL 2 NL HEADER NL  ENDSEC         0 NL ENDSEC NL  VAR            9 NL VARNAME NL  VARNAME         LETTER LETTER  DIGIT NL  INT            DIGIT NL  ANYCHARSEQ     ANYCHAR NL   fragment ANYCHAR       [u0021u00FF]  fragment LETTER        [AZaz]  fragment DIGIT         [09]  codepre  pBut obviously this fails when trying to parse the Integer code0code, since this is regarded as the group code code0code by the lexer, cause of the codeheadercode rule.p  pSo now Im clueless how to resolve my problem. Any help is highly appreciated.p  pstrongEDITstrong p  pchanged ANTLR grammar to include more lexer rules. Now the problem is that the lexer completely fails.

Negative 245 pA while ago, I had a C program that needed to call some functions in a C dll. I used pInvoke for that purpose. Some of the data I needed to pass in were structs. So, I would use the pInvoke Signature Toolkit to find out how to create a C struct that was equivalent to the struct that the C function took by reference. Then, I was able to pass these structs to the C code.p  pNow, I have sort of the opposite situation. I am in C code, and I am being handed comptrt object. This is essentially a pointer to a C object. The C object implements a COM interface with properties like getFoo, setFoo, etc., that I can use to pull values generally, they are just basic data types like float, bool, int, etc. from the C object and stuff them into my C counterpart. p  pThis works well, but its a little bit slow. When I profile my code, it spends a lot of time in clr. So, Im hoping to find a faster way, where I can perhaps add a function to the COM interface that will copy the entire C object into the C counterpart struct at once  sort of like how I did it with pInvoke above, except Im pulling the data from C code through a COM interface, rather than passing data TO C code through a pInvoke interface.p  pDoes anybody know of a way to do thatp

Negative 245 pIm starting out in Android and creating a basic todolist using codeListActivitycode. Essentially, every time an item an entry is clicked, the item is marked or unmarked in its corresponding codeSharedPreferencescode file. In addition, the corresponding codeTextViewcode is also slashed or unslashed using codesetPaintFlagscode, as followsp  precodeprotected void onListItemClickListView l, View v, int position, long id        super.onListItemClickl, v, position, id      SharedPreferences savedList  this.getPreferences0     String item  savedList.getStringposition  ,       if  item.containschecked             item  item.replacechecked,         SaveItemitem, position            TextViewv.setPaintFlags TextViewv.getPaintFlags amp  Paint.STRIKETHRUTEXTFLAG          else            item  checked  item         SaveItemitem,position         TextViewv.setPaintFlags TextViewv.getPaintFlags  Paint.STRIKETHRUTEXTFLAG              codepre  pThe checked here is just a string. In the codeOnCreatecode method, to read the codeSharedPreferencescode file to reload the items in the checklist, and for whichever ones have been marked, I would like, again, to strike it out, as followsp  precodefor int i  0 i     pos  i     listitems  savedList.getStringi,     if listitems.matches if first entry in saved file is empty, stop the loop         break          else iflistitems.containschecked         listitems.replacechecked,         listItems.addlistitems         adapter.notifyDataSetChanged              TextView textview  TextView getListView.getChildAti         textview.setPaintFlags textview.getPaintFlags  Paint.STRIKETHRUTEXTFLAG          else         listItems.addlistitems         adapter.notifyDataSetChanged       codepre  pThis doesnt seem to work, with two problems arising first, even though I am remove the checked from those that are checked, the item appearing in codeListViewcode still has a checked. And secondly, the strikes dont appear, leading me to believe that the corresponding codeTextViewcode hasnt been picked up.p  pEdit forgot to include something.p

Negative 245 pIve created a program that scatters three subclasses of point randomly across a 100 x 100 grid sugars, ants, and spiders. The ants move towards the sugar, and the spiders move towards the ants, and when the ants have eaten all the sugar, they run away from the spiders. I have a while loop that moves the ants at most one unit and the spiders at least two units every turn. The ants are inevitably all consumed, which terminates the while loop. Now, Id like to represent this program visually with a GUI, and Im not sure how to go about doing it. Im pretty sure I need to set the pane layout to null so that Im not forced to use only one object per area. Beyond that, Im not too sure.p  pIll post all the code, but its a bit verbose. What I really want to know is how to represent all the instances of all these types of points at once, and how to move them according to the principle of the game class while loop by itself, without a human clicking next turn, all the way until there are no ants left.p  precodepublic class Sugar extends Point  private double calories  private double calories private boolean eaten private int

For examplep  precode In PHP   pregmatchallmyregex, someString, matches if matches       pregmatch has found some matches, and now there is a variable      named matches available to the same scope where pregmatchall was called    codepre  pSo when I saw something similar but not syntacticallyidentical in ObjectiveCp  precode In ObjectiveC  NSArray myArray  [self getObjectsamperror] iferror       This is a compiler error, because the error variable      doesnt exist at this point, because ObjectiveC wont       let you assign variables in this way  codepre  pSo the solution is to remember, that PHP and ObjectiveC are very different, and strongthe correct syntax for using the codeampcode operator to cast a value pass by reference to a variable is like thisstrongp  precode In ObjectiveC  NSError error  nil  lt THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT NSArray myArray  [self getObjectsamperror]     iferror           Now the compiler wont complain, because the error variable           has been assigned. This block of code will run if the error variable          is still equal to nil. Which means the [self getObjects] ran without error.      else           if error  YES, it means that the [self getObjects] function          encountered an error and has assigned the reference to the error into           the error variable you previously assigned to nil, allowing it to           evaluate as nonnil      codepre  pHope this might help someone that encountered the same confusion as me. p
Negative 245 pAccording to KampR, codestrcmpcode cab be used to compare two lines, lexicographically. p.119 p  pThey use another function, codenumcmpcode, to compare two lines numerically.

Negative 245 pI am currently using AngularJS with UIRouter for state management and express on the backend.p  pI currently have hash bang mode enabled and have been trying to find a solution that allows you type URLs without the hash bang manually in the address bar.p  pSo for example instead of typingp  pwww.mysite.compage1p  pI want to able to typep  pwww.mysite.compage1p  pI have tried by enable html5Modep  precodelocationProvider.html5Modetrue                  .hashPrefix codepre  pBut it still doesnt work. With the above change, clicking any URLs will rewrite and change location from page1 to page1. Which is great.p  pHowever manually entering a URL with page1 does not work and gives an invalid path error.

Negative 245 pIm trying to apply a patch to an existing plugin using a fragment plugin as described herep  pa hrefhttpswiki.eclipse.orgStepstouseFragmentstopatchaplugin relnofollowSteps to use Fragments to patch a plugin  Eclipsepediaap  pThe patch to the host plugin involves replacing a single class file with an updated class file. But I dont get the concept in section emModify the Host package Manifest settingsem steps 5 to 11. Here it instructs you to modify the host plugin. I thought the whole idea is that you dont have to touch the host plugin  its the fragment that you deploy that adds the patchp  pMy product consists of eclipse platform and org.eclipse.cdt features plus my own plugins that use cdt. It is the org.eclipse.cdt.core plugin that I would like to patch.p  pIve followed the steps in the eclipse wiki and created my fragment project containing the package and class I want to patch in the host plugin. Ive built this in maven and when I run this product I see my fragment plugin is active, but the class it contains is not getting called the original host plugin class is.p  pIm guessing the problem is that the modified host plugin is not in my deployed product. There arent any steps included in the fragment guide on advice for deploying the host plugin and Im not sure howwhy it is necessary.p  pIve used a feature patch successfully in the past for this sort of thing, but only created using the PDE  I couldnt get my feature patch to build under maven  thats why Im exploring the use of fragments to see if I can get them to build under maven.p  pUPDATE I create my build using the Tycho plugin to Maven a hrefhttpwww.eclipse.orgtycho relnofollowTycho  Building Eclipse plugins with mavena.p  pThanks for linking to OSGi Core Release 5 Specification. That was useful reading.p  pSo if my understanding is correct a fragment can only overlay its class over the host plugins if the host plugin has already been prepared to be patched with a fragment. This involves modifying the host plugins manifest. Specifically 1. add a new library and move that above . package. Remove this library from the build properites the library is just a reference and should not be created by the host plugin.    add EclipseExtensibleAPI true to the manifest.mf file   bump the version number.p  pIn my case, it seems, if I wanted to patch the org.eclipse.cdt.core plugin using a fragment I would have to deliver the prepared version of the  org.eclipse.cdt.core plugin plus my fragment plugin.p  p not sure on answering etiquette dont have enough reputation to do many things.

That does not seem correct to me. As far as I understand, when codevar task1  PrintAnswerToLifecode runs, the executions goes into codePrintAnswerToLifecode where when it hits codeawaitcode returns execution to codeGocode, and proceeds to the next line codevar task1  PrintAnswerToLifecode, where the same thing happens again. In other words there is nothing occurring in parallel in the first two lines of codeGocode. In fact, unless there is a thread involved as in codeTask.Runcode or codeTask.Delaycode, no real parallelism ever occurs. Have I understood this correctly If so, what does Albahari really mean by saying that the two operations run in parallelp  pstrongQuestion 2strongp  pOn the same page, Albahari goes on to state the followingp  blockquote   pConcurrency created in this manner occurs whether or not the   operations are initiated on a UI thread, although there is a   difference in how it occurs. In both cases, we get the same   concurrency occurring in the bottomlevel operations that initiate it   such as Task.Delay, or code farmed to Task.Run. Methods above this   in the call stack will be subject to true concurrency only if the   operation was initiated without a synchronization context present...p blockquote  pWhat does Albahari mean by this I do not understand how a codeSynchronizationContextcode comes into play here, and what difference it makes.p

Negative 245 pI am reading about Array and BitVector sets at following location.p  pa hrefhttpwww.brpreiss.combooksopus4htmlpage390.html relnofollowhttpwww.brpreiss.combooksopus4htmlpage390.htmlap  blockquote   pIn this section we consider finite sets over a finite universe.   Specifically, the universe we consider is 0,1,..., N1, the set of   integers in the range from zero to N1, for some fixed and relatively   small value of N. p      pLet U 0,1,..., N1  be the universe. Every set which we wish to   represent is a subset of U. The set of all subsets of U is called the   power set  of U and is written 2  U i.e., 2 to power of U . Thus,   the sets which we wish to represent are the elements of 2  U. The   number of elements in the set U, written U, is N. Similarly, 2U    2U2N.  This observation should be obvious For each element of   the universal set U there are only two possibilities Either it is, or   it is not, a member of the given set. p      pThis suggests a relatively straightforward representation of the   elements of 2Uan array of Boolean values, one for each element of   the universal set. By using array subscripts in U, we can represent   the set implicitly. I.e., i is a member of the set if the i th  array   element is true.p blockquote  pMy questions on above text arep  ol lipWhat author mean by statement  The set of all subsets of U is called the power set  of U and is written 2  U i.e., 2 to power of U For example if we  have U 0,1,2 then we have 23  8 is set of all sub sets but we are having more than 8 for example empty set, 0, 1, 2, 0,1, 0,2, 0,3, 1,2, and 1,2,3 which is 9.

The problems I am encountering with my program are unrelated to the specifications and understandings of the class methods.p  pThe data set that I am supposed to graph using this java file is configured in the following wayp  p[name] [gender] [ranking] [ranking] [ranking] [ranking]....etc for a total of 14 rankings. p  pstrongExamplestrongp  pJane F 98 108 128 116 48 55 47 39 67 202 312 345 436 384p  pstrongGeneral goal of programstrong The user is supposed to input the name and gender they would like to see graphed.

The lines of these graphs are drawn with the methodp  precodeg.drawLinex1, y1, x2, y2 codepre  pwith g representing a Graphics object.

The problem is the incorrect printing of the lines that compose the graph. This is caused by incorrect for loop iterations and conditions, which are complicated by the awkward location of the for loop and the fact that two calls of everything are necessary to correctly run the program.

Negative 245 pIve been trying to use a factory in my Angular app to be able to share and update variables between controllers, however I havent had much luck. The app Im working on basically receives messages into an inbox and then I can decide whether to show them on a visualizer for people to see. Its a realtime interactive app that would be used during a conference or something when the speaker wants to interact with the audience and see their responses to a questionstatement.p  pIm using a factory to keep track of the messages in the queue that will be displayed on the visualizer page.

However, on the visualizer page, the scope variables that are referencing the factory arent being updated.p  pHere is my factory codep  precodeangular.moduletellApp   .factoryVisualizerFactory, function      return      queue [],     active ,     addToQueue functionmsg       this.queue.pushmsg             codepre  pBasically, from my inbox, I call the addToQueue function and pass in an object containing the message and some details. On the visualizer page all Im doing is just looking at the VisualizerFactory object to see if its updating and its not. It just returns the empty VisualizerFactory object.p  pThanks for any helpp

I was reading online and there is a way to register multiple applications by just adding your Application class and a custom initparam of requestAttribute. I was unable to get handlers to work however with my own custom org.apache.wink.common.WinkApplication class, so instead I used this property file approach and the default WinkApplication class to get it to work.  p  pHow do I configure multiple applications under 1 WAR via property files in web.xml andor how do I create an Application class that still correctly picks up my Jackson json provider and loads the handler class correctly, so that I can then just duplicate the multiple RestServlet apps. p  pIs this even the right approach multiple WinkApplications under different urlpatterns, where only 1 pattern has a security constraintp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 245 pI currently use MySQL, after looking into Document DB it seems like it may be a good move. I do a TON 95 of querying for single records. As my database gets larger, the time its taking to do this seems to be getting slower. Both reading and writing. Im curious based on the simplified scheme below if it could be a good move to a DocumentDB, and what the layout would be for said schema im a bit new to documentDBp  pstrongUserstrong UserID Username CreatedDatep  pstrongTankstrong TankID UserID REF User.UserID TankName Awardsp  pstrongMapstrong MapID MapName MapFIlep  pstrongMapDatastrong MapID REF Map.MapID TankID REF Tank.TankID Rank Color TimePlayed Equipmentp  pEverytime a player joins, the data from Tank,MapaData is Queried to gather a full tank object. Every time they die, win an award, kill somebody, or exit the game, the data is then written back out to tank,and mapdata. p  pThe website queries the User table for login, which stores the username and a hash of the password.

Negative 245 pIm trying to use WPF binding to an object that is contained by the DataContext object and it is not working.p  pIf I place all binding elements in the DataContext ViewModel object, everything works, but if I separate out the data list and data elements into a separate class that is contained by the ViewModel class, the ListBox data will work, but the binding to the individual data elements is not working. p  pWith my experimentation, I assume that the bound object needs to be directly bound to the DataContext ViewModel class.  I can do that and it works, but its not as object oriented or reusable as I would like it to be. Ive separated out the data list for the ListBox into its own class and Im assuming that since it is an ObservableCollection it works regardless of it being attached to the contained object.  Since the individual data elements of the objects are only notified through OnPropertyChanged, no matter what Ive tried, I cant get the WPF form to recognize the data, even though the DataContext.CurrentRecord shows the correct data.  I can only assume that the OnPropertyChanged notification are not going where I need them to go.p  pPartial Code for DataContext ViewModel is as followsp  precodepublic ObservableCollectionltItemModelgt Items      get  return ItemListMgr.Items      set  ItemListMgr.Items  value    public ItemModel CurrentItem      get  return ItemListMgr.CurrentItem      set  ItemListMgr.CurrentItem  value   codepre  pCorresponding code in Contained ItemListMgr object is as followsp  precodepublic readonly ItemListModel ItemList public ObservableCollectionltItemModelgt Items      get  return ItemList.Items      set              ItemList.Items  value         OnPropertyChangedItems        private ItemModel currentItem public ItemModel CurrentItem      get  return currentItem      set              currentItem  value         OnPropertyChangedCurrentItem       codepre  pThe Items object is the list that gets displayed and even using the contained object ItemListMgr, this part still works great.  As the user scrolls through the list CurrentItem is set to the active item in Items, but even though the WPF data entry elements are bound to the CurrentItem elements, they will not change when I scroll through the list.p  pThe Xaml code to bind a text box is as follows     TextBinding CurrentItem.ItemName, ModeTwoWay, NotifyOnValidationErrorTrue, ValidatesOnDataErrorsTruep  pThe Xaml code binds to the DataContext object, which is using a simple pass through to the contained ItemListMgr class. Ive tried to add the OnPropertyChange to the pass through elements, but that didnt help and I would guess only added to the confusion.p  pAs this is a large amount of code and fairly complex, I hope that Ive given enough key elements for you to understand what Im doing.  Hopefully there is a way to allow this type of binding as it will greatly enhance what Im doing.p  pWhatever help you can give will be greatly appreciated, Paulp

Negative 245 pIm developing a little commandline tool for a friend. Im on linux, but hes on Windows and I want to make the compilation process easy for him, as hes not used to having to compile stuff himself. p  pBuilding the tool works flawlessly, but now I want to add an install target to the Makefile that copies the binary to his cygwin64bin folder, which is supposed to be on his path. However, I want the Makefile to still run under linux. Is there a generic approach to his Or should I grep, sed, cut and awk my way through the PATH string and extract the folder Im looking forp

Negative 245 pConsider this programp  precodetemplate ltint F, int N  Fgt void f   constexpr int g  return 1  int main  fltggt  codepre  pIs this valid Are compilers required to see at template definition time, that codeFcode could potentially refer to a codeconstexprcode function, and therefore the default argument for codeNcode could be validp  pgcc and clang accept this, but Intelsup1sup rejects the template function at template definition time because codeFcode is not a constant expression. Intel does accept codefltg, ggtcode if the default argument is removed, so clearly it understands that codegcode is usable in a constant expression in general.p  pIts not clear to me what the standard says. Its clear that C11 [expr.const]p2p  blockquote   pan invocation of a function other than a codeconstexprcode constructor for a literal class or a codeconstexprcode functionp blockquote  prenders an expression nonconstant, but its not clear to me whether that applies here. At template definition time, it certainly does seem to apply, since codeFcode is not declared to be a codeconstexprcode function, but at the same time, errors at template definition time are supposed to be diagnosed only if there is no possible valid instantiation of the template, and there does appear to be a valid instantiation here.p  pI can see the arguments for both answers, so Im getting confused. Is there a definitive answer to this questionp  psubsup1.sup Retesting with the current release of Intels compiler shows that it works just fine, so presumably the Intel developers considered it a bug and have since fixed it. This is a huge hint that the code is meant to be valid. It would still be nice to get a conclusive answer based on the standard, though.subp

Negative 245 pIm creating an Android application that lets the device act as a server so that other clients on the same subnet can sendretrieve files from it currently HTTP and SSH via SCP command only are supported.p  pA priority of mine is having the file transfer be encrypted.  The obvious solution is an HTTPS transfer, but my average user may be put off by the fact that their browser will show the connection as not entirely secure because I wont have a certificate for their locallyhosted server.p  pMy second idea was to use SCP, which is inherently secure, from the browser, but I found out theres really no way to get a browser to open an SSHSCP connection without some plugin, and I want my solution to require nothing but the app itself.p  pMy third idea was to have a channel that is unsecure, but to encrypt the files end to end such that a file only touches the wire AFTER it has been encrypted.  Id use preexisting libraries in Java for the Android server and Javascript for the webbased client.p  pBut I feel that solution would be very slow for sending many small files, since instead of encrypting the stream, you have the overhead of encrypting each file entirely before sending.p  pTo ensure that this question is specific enough for Stack Overflowp  pHow do I go about sending a file securely between a web browserbased client and a locally hosted serverp

Negative 245 pIf I know that a lot of subfunctions are going to use a database object, should I get the object in my main method and then pass it to all the subfunctions to reuse, or is it much of a hit to just get it from the Entity Manager when I actually need itp  pI have a multiple layers of iterators, and the object isnt being used until the lowest level. Right now I am getting it on the top level and passing it through 4 layers of methods before actually using it.p  pThe real problem is I would like to use one of the middle functions in another part of the program, and instead of making a needless call to get that object. I would just call the function.p  pThe layout is something like thisp  precodegenerate     MyObj obj  getMyObj  Entity Manager find      generateSubItemsobj         generateSubSubItemsobj             generateSubSubItemValuesobj                  Use obj codepre  pThe problem is I want to use generateSubSubItems without having to call getMyObj if I can because I have to use it quite a few places. I dont really want to be spreading out dependent code all over the place for one, and for two it mucks up the code in the other places which I would like to keep as clean as possible.p  pWould it be a huge performance hit to do thisp  precodegenerate     generateSubItems         generateSubSubItems             generateSubSubItemValues                 MyObj obj  getMyObj  Entity Manager find                   Use obj codepre  pI am using EclipseLink, Glassfish, and SOFT caching.p  pUSAGE It would be used several hundred times per call to generateSubSubItemValues. This would get called several hundred times a day most likely.p  pSo it would add up. Especially as the software grows.p

Negative 245 pI have 2 java applications A and B. Application A runs on a weblogic server and B is a standalone java application. There is a gemfire cache region R on application A, that I connect to using  from B.

Now, I have looked at the gemfire documentation for creating cache listeners on the same server, but how do I do it from a different application and trigger an event in this other application. A solution would be to set up a queue and drop a message from A to B but, is it possible to do it using Gemfire.

Negative 245 pI have a rails 4 app, where I allow users to upload images. I have validations in place for min dimension of 640X385 and thus a min aspect ratio of 1.6623376623376624. Now that means user cant upload smaller images either in terms of dimension or aspect ratio. And when they upload a bigger image, it gets resized by ImageMagicks resizetofit method. But it resizes to a proportional width and height and my dimensions validation fails. If I use resizetofill, even the smaller images get stretched and bypass aspect ratios validation. So How do I get the resize method to resize an image perfectly to 640X385 dimensionp

Negative 245 pIm using AVX intrinsics, but since for everything other than mm256 based intrinsics MSVC generates nonvex instructions, I need to compiler the whole source code with archAVX. The rest of the project is compiled with archSSE2, so that it works on older CPUs and Im manually checking if AVX is available.p  pThe source containing AVX code compiled for AVX includes a huge library of templates and other stuff, just to have the definitions. Is there a possibility that the compilerlinker decides to instantiate some template with AVX instructions, just because it has been included in this source as well In that case it would make it crash on nonAVX processorsp

Negative 245 pConsider the following micro services for an online store projectbr Users Service keeps account data about the stores users including first name, last name, email address, etcp  pPurchase Service keeps track of details about users purchases.p  pEach service provides a UI for viewing and managing its relevant entities. The Purchase Service index page lists purchases. Each purchase item should have the following fieldsbr id, full name of purchasing user, purchased item title and price.br Furthermore, as part of the index page, Id like to have a search box to let the store manager search purchases by purchasing user name.p  pIt is not clear to me how to get back data which the Purchase Service does not hold  for example a users full name. The problem gets worse when trying to do more complicated things like search purchases by purchasing user name.p  pI figured that I can obviously solve this by syncing users between the two services by broadcasting some sort of event on user creation and saving only the relevant user properties on the Purchase Service end. Thats far from ideal in my perspective. How do you deal with this when you have millions of users would you create millions of records in each service which consumes users datap  pAnother obvious option is exposing an API at the Users Service end which brings back user details based on given ids. That means that every page load in the Purchase Service, Ill have to make a call to the Users Service in order to get the right user names. Not ideal, but I can live with it.p  pWhat about implementing a purchase search based on user name Well I can always expose another API endpoint at the Users Service end which receives the query term, perform a text search over user names in the Users Service, and then return all user details which match the criteria. At the Purchase Service, map the relevant ids back to the right names and show them in the page. This approach is not ideal either.p  pAm I missing something Is there another approach for implementing the above Maybe the fact that Im facing this issue is sort of a code smell would love to hear other solutions.p

Negative 245 pI have a website which runs in Azure, using an Azure database. My development database however is an code.mdfcode file. Because the data is constantly changing in the Azure database, I would like to be able to grab an snapshot of the data in order to have a newer representation of the data in my local code.mdfcode file. Because my code also inserts data into the database, I cannot simply connect to the production database from my local machine.p  pThe reason I have an code.mdfcode file is because I can package it with the code in source control. That way I do not have to provide an external test database when I move between machines I am the only developer.p  pIs it possible to somehow convert a database in SQL Server database in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to a code.mdfcode file Or have a query which synchronizes the data by copying it out of one and into the other databasep  pOne of the reasons I want to be able to synchronize the Azure database with my code.mdfcode file is so that I do not have to package in source control they can get pretty big, but rather generate one any time I need an code.mdfcode database to test with. I would rather not have a remote test database to connect to for development if I do not have to.p  pIt seems like I have over complicated things for myself. Are there better approaches to this than using an code.mdfcode database Is there a different approach to duplicating a production database for testingp

Negative 245 pI have a service being load tested by a third party. A few minutes after starting, we start to see requests hanging for a very long period of time and the caller ultimately times out after 60 seconds.p  pThey are testing with 15 users with each user using two devices at once, so a total of 30 connections.p  pThe service is a simple faade to a more complex operation, calling an external system. Benchmarking our communications to the external system looks as though everything is responding in the time we would expect sub 200ms.p  pThe IIS logs reveals a bunch of very high requests  200sec which ultimately do return a 200 and have Win32 error code codeERRORNETNAMEDELETDcode error code64code. I have checked the Service Log and can match up the response to the request based on the SOAP message id and can see that we do eventually respond with the correct information although the client has long given up.p  pAny ideas as to what could be causing this behavior Were hosting in IIS using wsHttpBinding and were using WSSecurity with x509 certificates message amp transport encryption.p  pWe dont have benchmark logging inside of our service but the code is a very simple mapping of the WCF request to the server request, making the request, and mapping the response to the WCF response. We do this manually and there is no parsing involved straight assignments.p

Negative 245 pAs I understand it, the C specification says that type codeintcode is supposed to be the most efficient type on target platform that contains at least 16 bits. p  pIsnt that exactly what the C99 definition of codeintfast16tcode is toop  pMaybe they put it in there just for consistency, since the other codeintfastXXtcode are neededp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pTo summarize discussion belowp  ul liMy question was wrong in many ways. The C standard does not specify bitness for strongintstrong. It gives a range [32767,32767] that it must contain. li liI realize at first most people would say, but that range implies at least 16bits But C doesnt require twoscompliment or even binary storage of integers. If they had said 16bit, there may be some platforms that have 1bit parity, 1bit sign, and 14bit magnitude that would still being meeting the standard, but not satisfy that range.li liThe standard does not say anything about strongintstrong being the most efficient type. Aside from size requirements above, strongintstrong can be decided by the compiler developer based on whatever criteria they deem most important. speed, size, backward compatibility, etcli liOn the other hand, strongintfast16tstrong is like providing a hint to the compiler that it should use a type that is optimum for performance, possibly at the expense of any other tradeoff.li liLikewise, strongintleast16tstrong would tell the compiler to use the smallest type thats  16bits, even if it would be slower. Good for preserving space in large arrays and stuff.li ul  pstrongExamplestrong MSVC on x8664 has a 32bit strongintstrong, even on 64bit systems. MS chose to do this because too many people assumed strongintstrong would always be exactly 32bits, and so a lot of ABIs would break. However, its possible that strongintfast32tstrong would be a 64bit number if 64bit values were faster on x8664. Which I dont think is actually the case, but it just demonstrates the pointp

When I create a company, I can select market1 and a new relationship is created between that company and market1. If I update the company, I can change the item in the dropdown and it will delete the old relationship and create a new one. p  pWhat I would like to do is to hook this dropdown menu to Bootstrap Multiselect so I can select multiple markets from my dropdown to create multiple relationships at once. Something like thisp  precodemarket2lt[RESEARCHING]company1[RESEARCHING]gtmarket1 codepre  pI have most everything figured out, my Bootstrap menu works except it doesnt update the database. I just dont know where to put this bit of code that adds the relationship upon submit p  precodecompany.market.tryid codepre  pAt least I think it does.

Negative 245 pthis problem has been bugging me for the entire day so Ive decided to post it on here. p  pMy start page includes an authenticationregistration feature where the session is initialized along with necessary attributes. This proceeds to a main page where the authenticatedNewly Registered user sees their dashboard. The session ID and attributes remain intact between these pages. As soon as I link to a third page from the main page all the session details are lost and a new one is initialized. p  pIt was working fine for a while and the session variables could be used to authenticate the user in the third page. Currently, a new session is being initialized I guess. Any help would be appreciated. Im a beginner to using apache servers. Ive been reading about session fixation attacks and if that is the case, Is there a proper way to URL in the main page such that my session remains intactp
Negative 245 pI am in the process of deserializing a JSON string with VB.NET. I am using JSON.NET and have made a custom class to use with JsonConvert.DeserializeObject function. The only issue I have is one of the values coming through the JSON string is called stop. This causes the VB.NET to not compile, owing to the fact you cannot declare a value with the name stop. When I change the value of stop to something else, the data from the stop value is no longer read from the JSON string. I have been trying to work out how to get around this, but short of changing the JSON string response, which I unfortunately cannot do, I have come up short.

Negative 245 pstrongIs there any conventional format to represent a mathematical formula, that could be read by a computerstrongp  pIm working on some mathematical problems, and have some kind of TDD approach to it. Every time I get stuck in a proof or simply that I have no proof yet, but some intuition of what the result should be, I tend to write a little program to check that everything so far behaves as Im thinking it does. I usually write a Haskell function for some intermediary result in my proof, play with it through codeGHCicode until Im convinced Im still going in the right direction.p  pMy absolute ideal would be to have some canonical form for math formulas which I could, using some tool, both output to LaTeX and Haskell. I could run QuickTest on it, and if a step is wrong, it would tell me. LaTeXs mathematical notations are actually pretty close to a emcanonicalem form, though a lot is inferred by the reader you dont want to explicitly write strongeverystrong parentheses. p  pThis ideal tool seems too good to be true rather, what would be the correct way to spell out a mathematical formula for a computer, possibly parsing it as well While looking around, I saw a lot for simple formulas using solely codecode,codecode,codecode,codecode and the like. Nothing encompassing things like sums e.g. over sets, derivatives, all the cool stuff. Moreover, the output of such parsers are mostly used to calculate a result, giving some values for the variables not for translating it to other languages language agnostic, I guess. It seems like something like this should either already exist, or there should be a good reason why not. Which one did I missp

Negative 245 pFollowing phenomena happens when using Xcode 7 beta 5 and Swift 2p  pWhen using a custom UICollectionViewCell that is created in the storyboard, the cells subviews are not added to the cells codecontentViewcode.

Negative 245 pI know similar questions have been asked numerous times, but Ive tried a number of answers and none seem to work for my situation.  Ive found a lot of solutions for sticky footers, but thats not exactly what Im looking for, or maybe I havent figured out how to use correctly for my situationp  ul lipI have fully fixed position navigation headersidebarsfooter.  The content flows on top of the header and footer.pli lipMy content wrapper layer is currently a 100 width 100 minheight layer above the navigation layer, and using simple padding on topbottom and margins on leftright, Im able to show the navigation elements.pli lipInside the wrapper layer I have my content div, which has my page background and a boxshadow.  But I cant get the content div to expand to the full height of the wrapper, because the wrapper height is based on percentage.  So everything works perfectly when I have content that fills or overflows the window, but when I dont, the content div is too small.pli ul  pSticky footer doesnt work in this situation because the sticky footer just covers the content the content itself is still 100 height.  I basically want the content to be minheight 100  minus the 50px header and 50px footer.p  pIs there any css solution to this without using a javascript hack or calc I would be willing to have the header  footer not be fix positioned  but I want to keep the boxshadow on the content div i.e. 50px from top and bottom of the page.p  pJSFiddle a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.nettyhenryn9rpbj3m5 relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.nettyhenryn9rpbj3m5ap  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv idnavgt     ltdiv idheadergt         header     ltdivgt     ltdiv idleftsidegt         left sidebar     ltdivgt     ltdiv idrightsidegt         right sidebar     ltdivgt     ltdiv idfootergt         footer     ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdiv idpagelayergt      ltdiv classpagegt         contentltbrgt         contentltbrgt         contentltbrgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pCSSp  precode      boxsizing borderbox   html, body     backgroundcolor eeffff     textalign center     margin 0     padding 0     height 100   header      position fixed     top0     left0     width 100     height 50px     backgroundcolor ddd   leftside      backgroundcolor bbb     position fixed     left 0     top 50px     width 50px     height 100   rightside      backgroundcolor bbb     position fixed     right 0     top 50px     width 50px     height 100     overflow hidden   footer      position fixed     bottom 0     left 0     width 100     height 50px     backgroundcolor aaa   pagelayer     positionrelative     padding 50px 0 50px 0     margin 0 50px 0 50px     minheight 100   .page      backgroundcolor fff     boxshadow 0px 1px 20px 0px rgba0, 0, 0, 0.8     width100  codepre

Negative 245 pMy java application will flash at undesirable times in the taskbar windows PC.  It is java 8 based.  This happens when the application is not in focus so it is minimized or I am using another application, such as this browser.  Then something happens in the program that causes it to flash in the taskbar.  Obviously it is getting some data from the server this is a client application and there is some bad code that does something that tells the PC to flash it in the icon.p  pThis is common with an instant messenger app  if someone IMs me and the app is out of focus, it will flash to get me to bring it up and see the new IM.p  pThis behavior is desirable when there is some information that pops up for the user, but it is not desirable when there is no compelling reason to push the user to bring the app to the foreground.  There is nothing on the screen of interest in most cases.p  pWhat causes the taskbar to flash the program icon  I think this is generally when a frame in the application has requested focus or is brought to the front or if there is a new framep  pMy question is really this  how do I debug this application so that it can tell me what is causing the flashing in the taskbar  This is a large project with thousands of classes.  This happens a few times per hour.  I just have no idea how to setup my debugger eclipse, if it matters to break when this occurs so I can trace the code and fix this permanently.p  pHow would you go about debugging thisp

Negative 245 pstrongHow can I route a task based on user attributes in IBM BPM 8.5.6strong p  pIn my case I have a list of attributes assigned to each users. For example a user will have an attribute called Region and this can have multiple values. So what we do is keep it as a comma separated string. Like REG1,REG2,REG3. Now when a task is initiated there will be a region associated with it. So I want this task to be routed to only those users who have that region value set. p  pIve created a team filter service and filter out a list of users. This works fine but the problem here is if we add a new user with appropriate region or add new regions to existing users these tasks are not visible to them. Is there any way to dynamically update the user listp  pstrongPS I can create one group per region or one team retrieval service per region as there will be 100s of regions.strong p

Negative 245 pI am building a cam publishing client in as3 for flash. Its almost finished, but I encountered some weird problem. In all browsers it works like a charm, but I discovered after two days of debugging that the protected mode of Firefox crashes the application. p  pThe problem is as follows. I have two dropdowns. One for the camera and one for the microphone. When I change the camera, it selects it and shows a preview. I can do this as many times as I like. Its different with the microphone dropdown. After two selects it crashes the app. The activityLevel indicator isnt also working as expected. While in the other browsers its ok.p  pI discovered that when I turn off protected mode it works ok. Now I want to let the application also run in protected mode, because this is the default behavior.p  pI cant find the problem. My code is as follows for the microphone.p  pThe application is build with flex and compiled with mxmlc.p  pWhen I set setLoopBack to false, the application doesnt crash, but the activityLevel isnt triggered and the sound isnt working. I use a similar approach for the selection of the camera and this one is working pretty well. p  pAre there some special limitations to protected mode in Firefox I cant find onep

Negative 245 phere is a small client GUI program written in c. The idea is first the client will send an id typed in the textboxto serverpressing the check button, the server will check that id and if its valid the server will return a value 0 otherwise 1. Now if the return value is 1, then the client will again take an input in the checkbox and send it to the server for another checkby pressing the check button. This process will go on until the client receives a 0 from the server. But, In my code, when I make an invalid input in the textbox, it hangs as well as the check button. So, I cant repeat the proces of sending a valid id to server.
