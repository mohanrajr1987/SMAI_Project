Positive 369 pSome programs can be executed from anywhere with a single oneword command. An example of this is youtubedl, which is a python program that can be executed with the simple command codeyoutubedl [input]code. As far as I have understood, this is simply because there exists a file called codeusrbinyoutubedlcode, and codeusrbincode is in PATH. However, I do not understand what I have to do to make something like this myself. Right now, I have a python project called codetestprojectcode that includes a python program like this codetestprojectfilesmyownprogram.pycodep  pWhat do I have to do to make this a binary executable such as youtubedlp  pI know I can make an codealias moppython testprojectfilesmyownprogram.pycode, and this is also what I have done, and it works fine. That is, I can write code mopcode, and successfully run my program.  But for curiositys, and learnings, sake, I want to know how to make a file such as the codeusrbinyoutubedlcode file, removing the need for aliases.p  pI find this hard to find information about in search engines... Any help is greatly appreciated p  pstrongEditstrongp  pMy question differs from the one marked as duplicate, in that Im not looking to execute it as a .shscript. I simply want to execute it as a suffixless oneword command, similar to all the other executables that are in codeusrbincode. p  pEx. code myowncode should run my program, without the need for aliases or writing .sh or .py at the prompt. That is, I want to have a file codeusrbinmyowncode that somehow runs my codetestprojectcode at the simple command codemyowncodefrom anywhere.p

Positive 369 pI have implemented an NSSplitView which essentially keeps a table on the left of the window like a sidebar, and a webView on the right. The user clicks the different rows of the table to load a url in the WebView.p  pMy issue is that when I run the app, the divider moves to the right edge of the width of the left view and the window size does not increase to accomodate the webView. At first I thought the webView was just not working, until I discovered I was able to drag the divider to the left which revealed the webView.p  pIts my understanding that the auto layout constraints setup within the view itself is how the split view resizes, however I create the webView programatically via a subclassed view controller rather than on a storyboard or xib. As a test, I tried placing a button and applying width constraints but it had no affect, the webView is still hidden, essentially with a width of 0 points and is only able to be revealed by dragging the split view divider to the left.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions how I can go about resolving this issuep  pThanks in advancep

Negative 369 pIm working on my first Django application. In short, what it needs to do is to display a list of film titles, and allow users to give a rating out of 10 to each film. Ive been able to use the  form  and  formset  syntax in a template to produce a form which lets you rate one film at a time, which corresponds to one row in a MySQL table, but how do I produce a form that iterates over all the movie titles in the database and produces a form that lets you rate lots of them at once p  pAt first, I thought this was what formsets were for, but I cant see any way to automatically iterate over the contents of a database table to produce items to go in the form, if you see what I mean.p  pCurrently, my views.py has this codep  precodedef surveyrequest         ScoreFormSet  formsetfactoryScoreForm         if request.method  POST                 formset  ScoreFormSetrequest.POST, request.FILES                 if formset.isvalid                         return HttpResponseRedirect         else                 formset  ScoreFormSet         return rendertoresponsecfsurvey.html,                  formsetformset,          codepre  pAnd my survey.html has thisp  precodeltform actionsurvey methodPOSTgt lttablegt  formset  lttablegt   ltinput type  submit value  Submitgt ltformgt codepre  pOh, and the definition of ScoreForm and Score from models.py arep  precodeclass Scoremodels.Model         movie  models.ForeignKeyMovie         score  models.IntegerField         user  models.ForeignKeyUser  class ScoreFormModelForm         class Meta                 model  Score codepre  pSo, in case the above is not clear, what Im aiming to produce is a form which has one row per movie, and each row shows a title, and has a box to allow the user to enter their score.p  pIf anyone can point me at the right sort of approach to this, Id be most grateful.p

Negative 369 pReviewing code, I came across a number of new Private Shared variables of type HashtablesOf String, initialized in the declaration added to a partial class for a very large DataContextderived class.  This seems sensible to me in one sense because they never change, and making these shared variables ensures that they wont get reinitialized every time a function is called. However, these variables emareem only used within the scope of one function in the class, and I fear the private namespace of this DataContextderived class is getting rather polluted, and having these sorts of things exposed at such a high level might be confusing to others reading the code in the future.  Would there be negative performance impact to making these local variables within the function where they are used, or is there some better way to handle this  Basically we are using these 3 hashtables to determine whether anything within particular subsets of properties changed using GetModifiedMembers and then using the Overlaps function of the hashset to see if any of the modified members correspond to members we care about.p  pEdit I caved and took the time to write my own test program, which confirmed that there is a cost to using local variables which I assume applies generally to all cases  I doubt theres any case where a shared variable would be slower unless using the shared variable requires some additional logic to do so properlyp  precodeSub Main   Dim st As New Stopwatch   Dim specialCount As Integer  0   Dim r As New Random   Dim params As Integer   ReDim params0 To 9   st.Start   For i As Integer  1 To 100000      For j As Integer  0 To 9         paramsj  r.Next100      Next      If IsSpecialShareparams Then specialCount  1   Next   st.Stop    Console.WriteLineShared  amp specialCount   Console.WriteLinest.Elapsed.ToString    st.Reset   specialCount  0    st.Start   For i As Integer  1 To 100000      For j As Integer  0 To 9         paramsj  r.Next100      Next      If IsSpecialLocalparams Then specialCount  1   Next   st.Stop    Console.WriteLineLocal  amp specialCount   Console.WriteLinest.Elapsed.ToString  End Sub  Dim specialListShared As New HashSetOf IntegerNew Integer 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41  Private Function IsSpecialLocalByVal paramList As IEnumerableOf Integer As Boolean   Dim specialListLocal As New HashSetOf IntegerNew Integer 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41   Return specialListLocal.OverlapsparamList End Function  Private Function IsSpecialShareByVal paramList As IEnumerableOf Integer As Boolean   Return specialListShared.OverlapsparamList End Function codepre  pSample Outputp  precodeShared 75232 000000.0408223 Local 75018 000000.1344628 codepre  pSo in this particular case, using the local variable costs about 200.  But in most cases including my own, the time is probably negligible compared to the overall task.  So I guess the question now becomes, how do people generally feel about improving code maintainability at the cost of negligible but known performance impactsp

Then the agent will take care to process or not the data, base on if the creds are OK. But this most probably will require some form of impersonation  I.e. to map somehow the anonymous user to the one, which has the rights to execute the agent. So, I valid answer to this question may be an advise how to set this up.p  pAdditionally  we are looking at the web service approach available in Domino 7.0, but it will require changes on both sides  the sender our publisher service and the receiving agent. And most probably will lead back to the original question about how to authenticate the sender.p  pAny advice in that regard even changing the approach will be highly appreciated.p  pCheersp

Negative 369 pI use a simple PHP script to run an online comic which basically uses a GET to take an integer value ini and insert an img tag for ini.jpg. It doesnt do any sanitizing or error checking beyond making sure that ini.jpg exists.

Negative 369 pI have ran into a curious problem. An algorithm I am working on consists of lots of computations like thisp  precodeq  x0y0z0  x1y1z1  ... codepre  pwhere the length of summation is between 4 and 7.p  pThe original computations are all done using 64bit precision. For experimentation, I tried using 32bit precision for x,y,z input values so that computations are performed using 32bit, and storing final result as 64bit value straightforward cast.p  pI expected 32bit performance to be better cache size, a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSIMD relnofollowSIMDa size, etc., but to my surprise there was no difference in performance, maybe even decrease.p  pThe architecture in question is Intel 64, Linux, and a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiGNUCompilerCollection relnofollowGCCa. Both codes do seem to use a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiStreamingSIMDExtensions relnofollowSSEa and arrays in both cases are aligned to 16 byte boundary.p  pWhy would it be so My guess so far is that 32bit precision can use SSE only on the first four elements, with the rest being done serially compounded by cast overhead.p

Negative 369 pIve written the rudiments of a class for creating dynamic structures in C. Dynamic structure members are stored contiguously with as far as my tests indicate the same padding that the compiler would insert in the equivalent static structure.

What parts of this code are dangerously in need of modificationp  pI have one other designrelated question Is a templated codegetcode accessor the only way of providing the compiler with the requisite static type information for typesafe code As it is, the user of codedynamicstructcode must specify the type of the member they are accessing, whenever they access it.

Negative 369 pI have a clientserver app and i observed that in a local environment i.e. LAN  when i close the stream that connects the client to the server  at one end, at the other end it is observable  i.e. if in my client i close the stream that connects the client to the server, at the other end, at the server, it is noticeable and it is reported as an Exception in the trycatch block that surrounds my serverstream code  . p  pHow is it possible  Does the clientserver send a specific code that the stream is closed just before closing the stream  Is it applicable also in wider networks  like big WANs   p  pThe bigger question is that when i close a stream at one end, can i rely on the fact that at the other end it will be noticed and in consequence close that thread and not just wait endless to recieve data that will never come due to the fact that that stream is closed  p  pThe maximum distance between a client and a server is 700 km  i dont know if it plays a role but i mentioned it just in case p  pThanks p

Negative 369 pIs there any programming language to do graphical layout for semiconductor manufacturing So far I am using LEdit, an expensive and rudimentary CAD program. As my design is composed of hundreds of identical cells with only small variations, creating the design programatically sounds like the way to go. Especially as I could take dimensions from a database and have them available for later testing. At the moment, I am giving the designer a list of the sample sizes I need, he draws them, I check them, and then enter them manually into my wafer mapping software. Output format needs to be dxf or better gerber. The program needs the capability to output many different layers. I had a look at pgftikz, and the programming language side is more than enough for the application, but the output is somewhat limited no gerber, no layers etc.. In addition, I need very good resolution down to nanometers, I havent tested that yet.p  pAny other recommendation for a graphics programming language, or library, for wafer layoutp

The two are intricately connected using AIDL including callbacks so its duplex communication, IPC, whatever.p  pAny time the two talk Im using that.p  pHowever I have also extended the Application class  so that the two can share common data objects.  So the Application holds a User object that the Service is always using, and the Activity can also access it when its running.p  pThe Application also has a WeakReference to the Activity to avoid context leaks because the User will sometimes trigger UI updates.p  pSo it looks like p  pcodeActivity UI gt Application lt Servicecodep  pI can trigger UI events within the Service by doingp  precodeapp  FooApplicationthis.getApplication FooActivity uiRef  app.getUIReference.get if uiRef  null     uiRef.updateSomeDisplay  codepre  pSo I dont get it.

Negative 369 pI am developing a web service that mainly returns C datatables.p  pIt currently caches the output results into memcached cluster which is refreshed by another cache updater based on the internal messages.p  pSince those caches dont expire, it is crucial to have good failover etc... As I go on with this, it gets quite difficult to ensure failover or reliable cache key control on this bare bone memcached cluster.p  pAlso the scalability is becoming an important concern since this is going to be behind a large traffic portal.p  pSo I am thinking if any cloudbased DB service AWS SimpleDB, AWS MySQL or Azure can be a good candidate for this.p

Negative 369 pIm trying to add a js function dynamically so I read about code.getScriptcode. Correct me if Im wrong, but it seems code.getScriptcode will just call a .js file thats already there in the public folder and will just sort of load it and make it available, but the js file itself being called is just a static js. What Im trying to do is call a dynamic js script and the content of this js script changes considerably, so it has to come from the server.p  ul liI think this isnt possible with code.getScriptcode alone, or is it li liIf not, I could make an ajax that returns the function syntax, but how do I then add it somehow to the current js or how do I create a js file for it and load that js li liI would possibly like to delete the new js later, but thats not a priority. li ul  pSo can code.getScriptcode help with this or a combo of code.getScriptcode and .ajaxp

Negative 369 pThere is a requirement to find the real time distance traveled using google maps. This should be calculated by the phone app itself. When I mean real time, I mean for example if the user is traveling to point A, the user can get to the point in many ways, what I want to do is calculate the total distance the user has traveled real time and not just assume and calculate the distance between the two points which would not give the correct answer.p  pI googled around for this problem but could not find any method in doing so.p  pI personally thought of storing the longitude and latitude on the phone in a list and after the user reaches the destination the distance is caluclated using these points. However this means that I have to decide the interval in which these points are stored every 1 min or so, which would mean that I would place location points in the list even though the user was actually still on the same road, which is quite unnecessary. Unless if anyone knows how to store the points at the appropriate time or some other solutionp  pI am well more or less stumped on this problem, any help is really appreciatedp  pThe mobile platform is Androidp  pThanks, MilindaD p

Negative 369 pI am adding Twitter and Facebook login to a MVC 3 test application using TweetSharp and Facebook C SDK.p  pCurrently when a user signs in using Twitter I create a user account for that user in a user table and store the id, token, and token secret in a separate table with a foreign key to the user table. Since the id, token and token secret do not expire I can quickly locate the right user account when the user logs in next time using Twitter.p  pWhat if the very same user logs in using Facebook next time Since Twitter does not provide email in their API and I therefore have no common piece of information to tie a user account to either Twitter or Facebook I assume I have to create a new user account for a Facebook login Does anyone have any experience with this Are there any ways to solve thisp

Negative 369 pBefore I start, Id like to clarify that my current understanding of AOP terminology is as follows...p  ul liAspects are the AOP equivalent of Classes in OOP.li liAdvices are the AOP equivalent of Methods in OOP.li liPointcuts are the AOP equivalent of using code in OOP. In OOP we invoke things. In AOP we weave things. The decision of emwhatem to weave emwhereem is defined by Pointcuts.li ul  pOnto the actual question...p  pI have a logging aspect in PostSharp which I want to use weave on every method, excluding properties. Originally I was using the following on my aspectp  precode[MulticastAttributeUsageMulticastTargets.Method, TargetMemberAttributes  MulticastAttributes.Instance] codepre  pHowever, I found the aspect was still being woven into properties, meaning I had to perform a secondary check at runtime to preclude my code from executing on propertiesp  precodeif methodName.StartsWithset ampamp methodName.StartsWithget  codepre  pThis is not ideal. I should be able to define this behavior in my pointcut so that I dont have to perform any runtime checking.p  pI have been looking into the codeMethodPointcutcode attribute which appears to provide me with a callback to help the weaver select candidates for the advice at build time. emPlease can I see an exampleemp  pAssuming this does work, I am still left thinking Why must I hardcode Pointcuts to my Advices. Aspects and Advices are the definitionimplementation. Pointcuts are the usage. The two should be seperate.p
Negative 369 pIve been using Delphi for years and years and each of my projects is compiled from source into the exe  no packages etc. If MyUnitA.pas is used anywhere, it is simply declared in the interface or implementation section of another unit that requires it. This all works fine everywhere and means that in my project source dpr there are only frame definitions which seem to be needed there else they dont show up in the frame list and the odd definition of a unit that must be called very early eg madExcept, FastMM etc.p  pI notice that XE baulks a bit sometimes at resolving stuff in the dpr until you actually compile it. In addition, when working with packages its a warning if stuff has to be implicitly pulled in without having been explicitly added to the package. This got me wondering whether we should be diligently adding ALL of our used units to our dpr like the package definition or rightclick project and Add to project. What do you dop

Negative 369 pIm experiencing a strange problem that Im not able to figure out. The proxy when used in my Java code to make nonSSL requests always gives error informing me that I cannot send SSL requests to the specified port whereas Im not even trying to send any SSL request, however the same proxy when configured in my Firefox browser works like a charm and I can browse all web sites normally. Note that using the same Java code, I can send requests to 443 port alone. But thats because the proxy detects that the requests are SSL, and thats why it only allows them to pass through 443 port.p  pI dont have the option to use codeDhttp.proxyHostcode and codeDhttps.proxyHostcode options with me because they simply wont work on the Socket objects, I would need a Socks proxy which I dont have access to. So I opted to go with commonshttpclient3.1.jar, and used codeProxyClientcode object to obtain the socket.p  pThis is the code Im using to obtain a socketp  precode Proxy Client ProxyClient client  new ProxyClient client.getHostConfiguration.setHostgoogle.com, 80 client.getHostConfiguration.setProxycorporateproxy, 80 ConnectResponse response  client.connect Socket socket  response.getSocket if socket  null    System.err.printlnresponse.getConnectMethod.getStatusLine  codepre  pand this is the exact error message that is printed by my codeSystem.err.printlncode statementp  pcodeHTTP1.1 502 Proxy Error  The specified Secure Sockets Layer SSL port is not allowed. ISA Server is not configured to allow SSL requests from this port. Most Web browsers use port 443 for SSL requests.  codep  pPlease dont suggest me to use codeURLConnectioncode because I dont need the proxy for HTTP requests alone.p  pI have also tried to explicitly specify the protocol to be codehttpcode without any luckp  pcodeclient.getHostConfiguration.setHostgoogle.com, 80, Protocol.getProtocolhttpcodep  pAny suggestions on how to configure this codeProxyClientcode object, so that the proxy server doesnt see requests to be coming as SSL requestsp  pThanks.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI seem to have figured out the reason why the ISA server thought Im using SSL. Actually the statement codeclient.connectcode creates a socket that is connected, via the HTTP CONNECT method, to a proxy. The Java doc says that, even though HTTP CONNECT proxying is generally used for HTTPS tunneling, the returned socket will not have been wrapped in an SSL socket.p  pBut for ISA, it would still think about this kind of HTTP request as an SSL request. And when it sees that this SSL request is not on 443, instead it is on some other port, it straight away rejects it.p  pSo now the problem instead is that how do I make the client.connect call to send an HTTP GET or HTTP HEAD instead of HTTP CONNECT.. p

Thats not the problem.p  pTo explain the problem Im going to use an example. Supose I have two models, Projects and Tasks, where project has many tasks and task belongs to project. But in this case I can create a task without a project foreign key could be null and I want to make the association later.p  pSo my idea is, when I create the project I want to associate tasks that already exists, so when i save the project, the foreign key in task should be the id of the project just createdp  pIs that possible, hope you can help me, thanksp

Negative 369 pIm designing an app that allows users to flip between multiple pages in a ViewPager.  Ive been struggling trying to figure out how it is possible to remove a Fragment instance from a page when it is no longer visible on screen, cache it to, say, a HashMap, and then restore it so that when the user flips back to that page, the views and everything else in it will be in the same state it was before removal.  For example, my first page is a login screen that makes certain layout elements on that particular page visibleinvisible on a successful login.  When I flip forward enough pages then flip back to the first page, the layout is reset.  This becomes more of a problem for another one of my pages which contains a huge, horizontalvertical scrolling grid of data that I use a thread in the background to draw when it initializes.  I use a progress dialog to notify the user of loading progress and that becomes really annoying everytime I have to load it.p  pSo I did some research...p  pI browsed through the source code for FragmentStatePageAdapter and in the destroyItem callback, the state of the Fragment instance being removed is saved to an ArrayList.  When a new instance of the Fragment is being created in the instantiateItem callback, if an instance of an item doesnt already exist they keep track of this by using an ArrayList, a new Fragment instance is created and its saved state is initialized with the corresponding Fragment.SavedState data.  Unfortunately, this data does not include the state that the Views were in although I noticed that for pages with a GridViewListView, the state of the Views were somehow restored if I scrolled to some random position, flipped a few pages and came back, it would not be reset.p  pAccording to the APIp  blockquote   pThe saved state can not contain dependencies on other fragments    that is it cant use putFragmentBundle, String, Fragment to store a   fragment reference because that reference may not be valid when this   saved state is later used. Likewise the Fragments target and result   code are not included in this state.p blockquote  pBeing a noob to Android, Im not quite sure I understand the last statement.p  pThat being said, is there any way to cache View state  If not, I think Ill just go ahead and go with leaving all the fragment  pages in memory.p

Negative 369 pI am thinking of how to best approach the following problem and any advice from people experienced in data visualization would be welcome. I plan to code it with canvas in GWT or javascript, or reuse some library if possible. I cannot use google visualisation and other hosted apis.p  pI have a time series of some data, let us say clicks per hour on a page. I have collected a lot of data so far few years and would like to present it in a char that would initially display all of the data, then after some pause the chart should automatically zoom to a single year, than to single month and so on until showing the data for today... I would like to animate this zoom so as to provide more clarity which part is show next. Also note that data is cumulative in a sense that when showing 1 day on y, one pixel on x represents let us say 1 hour, but when showing 1 year that same pixel represents maybe two weeks so the value on y should be sum of all the hours in those weeks. I know next to nothing of signals theory, but I thing that if the charting library cannot provide resamplingsummary for me I can do it myself. I am not sure what kind of results simple weighted summing of the data into predetermined number of buckets would make. Do I need to use some more complex algorithms, FFTs or whatp  pThanks, any advice or pointers are much appreciated.. NBp

Negative 369 pIn the course of adding exception handling for occasional SQL problems random timeouts, etc. to my various queries in my EF4 web app, Ive really got to refactor the common exception handling code into one function to maintain.  But I do lots of different kinds of LINQ queries on different entities.p  pMy first pass at this is close, I think. In this example, I have two overloaded functions that take different kinds of parameters that do a very similar database queryp  precodepublic bool checkpersonstring name      return CheckInternalpeople.Wherex gt x.username  name   public bool checkpersonGuid ID      return CheckInternalpeople.Wherex gt x.userID  ID   protected bool CheckInternalIQueryableltpeoplegt peepQuery       try                returnpeepQuery.Any causes actual db query            catch Exception ue       blah blah retry blah blah   codepre  pSo Im just pushing the actual enumeration to the codeCheckInternalcode function that has all kinds of fancy exception handling and retry logic in it which is totally independent of the query or even the table being queried.p  pNow the drawback here is that I can only pass in an codeIQueryableltpeoplegtcode but I want to be able to pass in an codeIQueryablecode on lots of different entity types other than the codepeoplecode type.p  pI tried wrapping my head around lambdas to allow me to pass in any kind of query on any entity type and have just one wizbang exception handler to maintain, but Im just not there yet with my lambda and delegate knowledge. I cant figure it out. p  pCan someone give me a hint What if I had another function that wanted to do a query on the widgets table and pass it to codeCheckInternalcode Its critical that the actual enumeration strongonlystrong happen in the codeCheckInternalcode function since thats where the exception will be thrown.p

Negative 369 pI have a number of list of books name along with their authorsno ISBN number. I want to maintain a single list containing unique entries of books and remove the duplicate entries of every book.p  pThe problem I am facing is that the different list may follow different conventions to store the books entries. For e.g  A list might store the author name in codelast namecode codefirst namecode convention, in another list, the name entry of the book itself contains some addition information like the name of the series along with the sequence number. p  pIs there any standard algorithm to handle such type of problem I dont want to reinvent the wheel.

Im guessing its the way I am using the .ashx, so any direction on whats wrong with the following code is appreciated.  Thanks,p  precodeJquery is inherited, and Im pretty sure this is all correct ltlink hrefuploadifyuploadify.css typetextcss relstylesheet gt ltscript typetextjavascript srcuploadifyswfobject.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcuploadifyjquery.uploadify.v2.1.4.min.jsgtltscriptgt  Again, this all works as expected.  CSS displays, SWF works, the issue I THINK deals with script and folder.  My Upload.ashx is in the root, as well as uploads folder ltscript typetextjavascriptgt document.readyfunction       alerthere     fileupload.uploadify         uploader uploadifyuploadify.swf,         script Upload.ashx,         cancelImg uploadifycancel.png,         folder uploads,         multi true,         auto true       ltscriptgt  ltinput idfileupload namefileupload typefile gt  My handler code, Im not sure if this works or not but I do know that if I try to debug nothing ever fires... Im sure thats part of the problem lt WebHandler LanguageC ClassUpload gt  using System using System.Web using System.IO  public class Upload  IHttpHandler   public void ProcessRequestHttpContext context      HttpPostedFile file  context.Request.Files[Filedata]      file.SaveAsC  file.FileName      context.Response.ContentType  textplain     context.Response.WriteHello World   public bool IsReusable      get              return false        codepre  pThats everything I have.  If I try to upload a file with SWFUpload jQuery it says it succeeds but nothing ever saves to the folder.  If I try with Uploadify it fails with either an HTTP Error or IO Error, and again, nothing saves.  Thanks for any and all help.p

Negative 369 pi need some suggestion for working on 3 tier architecture, recently i completed one of my clients site, with 3 tier architecture, in that i was transforming the data directly in html from sql server 2008 and fetching the records in .net, .net was just doing the rendering task, so one of my friend said, it could reduce the performance drastically, but i never got any complaint from client regarding the same, as the records i am transforming in html from sql server 2008, is not more than max 10, and now for the second site, i want to take more precaution while rendering data on the site, now this time i have planned to again use 3 tier, but now instead of transforming data to html in sql server i am pulling the records from sql server 2008, to my datalogic layer, and in bussinesslogic layer, i am transforming it to HTML.. so can anyone suggest which is the best way to go about, the previous tranforming in HTML in SQL SERVER or in .NETp  pBy Transforming in HTML i meanp  precodeALTER PROCEDURE [dbo].[SPTVTArticleGet]     ID INT AS BEGIN     DECLARE HTML NVARCHARMAX     SET HTML       SELECT HTML       ltdiv stylemargintop10px classcraiggtltspan styleSELECT CASE ISNULLAuthor,  WHEN  THEN displaynone floatleft ELSE displayblock floatleft ENDgt   ISNULLC.Author,    ltspangt   DATENAMEDW, C.PublishDate     CONVERTVARCHAR15, CASTC.PublishDate AS TIME, 100 ltdivgt     ltdiv classsonytitlegtC.Titleltdivgt      CASE      WHEN C.SecondaryTitle IS NOT NULL THEN         ltdiv classtokiyogt  C.SecondaryTitle  ltdivgt     ELSE     ltdiv classtokiyogtTOKYO Six broadcasters amp theaters in at least 22 will carry 3D coverage.ltdivgt     END      ltdiv classimgtxtpara01gt ltimg srcisnullC.Thumbnail, styleSELECT CASE ISNULLC.Thumbnail, WHEN  THEN displaynone ELSE displayblock END gt       CASTC.Article AS NVARCHARMAX ltdivgt      FROM CrossArticleArticle C      WHERE Id  ID       SELECT HTML END codepre  pand this time which i am planning to do is like this..

Negative 369 pI am still quite new to JQuery and am having difficulties with using the .ajax function.  I am attempting to send data to a java servlet for processing.

My dilema on the servlet.  How do I retrieve the data.  I tried to use a HashMap like thisp  precodeHashMap hm  new HashMap hm.putAllrequest.getParameterMap codepre  phm turns out to be null which I am guessing means the .getParameterMap isnt finding the keyvalue pairs.  Where am I going wrong or what am I missingp
Negative 369 pThe ONLY argument I can see for SOAP WCF over REST json wcf is the fact that once my service is created I can add a a reference in visual studio and I get a load of strongly typed classes ready for me and a client class that I can call all my webmethod through. It even sets up the web.config as far as I remember. p  pHowever when I expose a REST json service I still get a WSDL. So Im wondering is there still a way to build my references automaticallyp

Negative 369 pHello Because I spent hours looking for a solution and found none, and discovered the error I though Id go out and post it. p  pI created an NSOpenPanel in the same way everyone is creating it set the file types that it accepts, and gave it a call to runModal, and the program froze for about 15 seconds and then continued operation as if the modal had been cancelled. The problem was that I was using entitlements with my application, and when app sandboxing I needed to set user file access to read write in order for it to work. once i set that up in my project settings, i ran the program again and was able to use the NSOpenPanel.  good luck all.p

If I didnt need the quotations, I could just use a split eventually, though, this pattern will get much more complicated, so I will need to use the Regex this is just the first iteration.p  pId appreciate any help thanks in advance p

Negative 369 pI have a project I am working that will involve creating one DLL that will be used across multiple other sites. Inside this DLL we need to reference about 10 Enums. The values of these Enums however will be different for each site the DLL is used on. For examplep  pMyBase.dll may have a class MyClass with an attribute of type MyEnum.p  pMyBase.dll is then referenced in MySite. MyStie will also reference MyEnums.dll which will contain the values for the MyEnum type.p  pIs there any way to accomplish this While building MyBase.dll, I know what enums will exist in side of MyEnums.dll. The problem is I cannot build MyBase.dll without specifically referenceing the MyEnums.dll, which is not created until the MyBase.dll is used in a specific project.p  pI hope that makes sense and hope I can find an answer here.p  pThanks.p  pEditp  pThanks for all the comments. It will take a few reads to completely understand, but let me try to give a better example of what I am looking at here.p  pLets say the following code is in my DLL that will be put into various projects. Status is an enum.p  precodepublic Class MyClass      private Status currentStatus      public Status CurrentStatus              get                      return currentStatus                    public void ChangeStatusStatus newStatus              currentStatus  newStatus       codepre  pWhat I want to be able to do is the define the possible values for Status in the individual projects. So in this DLL, I will never reference what values might be in the Status enum, I just have to know that it exists.p  pI hope that is a bit more clear on what I am trying to do.p

Negative 369 pI am trying to find the fastestless complicated way to get a result for the following problem.p  pI have a DB of for example Lego Kits, where each Kit has a description and a list of Lego pieces needed and how many of them. An user can insert his collection of Lego pieces and then ask what Kit he can build with his pieces and what else he can build if he buys other pieces maybe a first limit is that he can buy only 1 type of piece.p  pWhat I have is roughly thisp  precodeLegoDesign  id  name  LegoBlock  id  type  weight  description  LegoBlockForDesign  LegoDesign.id  LegoBlock.id  numberOfPiecesNeeded  Collection  User.id  LegoBlock.id  quantityAvailable codepre  pFor example, the DB contains the LegoDesign for StarWars Death Star. LegoBlock contains a long list of pieces like 2x2 black square or small wheel etc. LegoBlockForDesign assign the LegoBlocks to the LegoDesign of he Death Star for example 1000 pieces of 2x2 black square.  The Table collection instead contains what pieces the user has. Now the problem here is that I have to query for the Design with the pieces the user has which means 1st checking for the LegoBlock.id and then checking for the numberOfPiecesNeeded since I could have some 2x2 black square pieces but not enough to build the Death Star. This is the first query. The second one should check for Design that contains the block I have plus some blocks I dont have in my collection. This means that I should check for LegoBlock in my possession but with less than the right amount and for Design with blocks not in my possession. The latter needs a limit that could be set manually. I was thinking to let the user pick between a limit on the number of pieces to buy ie max 30 pieces or a limit on difficulty of pieces ie. no special block to buy, like some special wheel or character present only in specific Design the characters of Star Wars, for example.p  pIm not entirely sure it can be done in SQL, especially because I have to check for quantities and not only for the existence of the block.p  pEDIT Ive added LegoBlock.type and LegoBlock.weight. This way I can define type  common,rare,unique to define normal pieces or specific ones like the Star Wars characters that can be defined rare. I dont want to buy those pieces since they can be used only on the StarWars Design. Weight instead can be used to give a priority I like blue, so I would prefer to see the Design where I have to buy blue pieces.p

Negative 369 pI am designing tables for an ordering system for project management of large commercial construction projects. When entering a customer order, the customer has their original purchase order.  Down the road the customer will make changes to the original PO by adding to the order or making changes.  These changes I need to marktrack and number them as a change order on the customer order, but the original order needs to stay intact at the top of the order with its subtotal to preserve the original quoteorder, and any changes to be listed below as changes with their related pricing.  Then there will be a new total at the bottom that would account for the original order and the change orders.p  pWhat are some ideas on how I can design the tables to track these changes separate from the original order itemstotal  p  pSo far I have the tables Customer, Order, OrderDetail, Product, etc. p  pEDIT To hopefully clarify  p  ul liCustomer places an orderOrder table OrderID, PO, OrderDate, etc. li liThe order has one to many line items OrderDetail table LineID, Qty, Description, etc li liAn order can have one to many order changes.  li liAn order change is just adding line items to the order, each order change one or more line items needs to be documented as example Change Order 1, Change Order 2, etc so that they can be referenced easily between the customer and my client.li ul  pOnce the order is placed, if the customer wants to add to the order later, I see adding addition lines items to OrderDetail table.p  pSo my client needs to be able lookupp  ul liWhat items are on the original order, and what is the original order total.li liWhat Change Orders have been made to the order, with each change order having its own date and price.li liWhat is the new order totalli ul  pMy question is, can I just place the change order line items in with the same table, or a different table How do I show what was part of the original order  How do I show what items are part of each change order  p  pWould it be best to use another table or twop  pstrongEDIT Possible solutionsstrongbr Darklantern  Let me know if I understand your idea, it would look like thisp  pstrongInitial Orderstrongbr codeOrder Headercodebr code Version  1codep  pcodeOrder Detailcodebr code Version  1 Part  Acodebr code Version  1 Part  Bcodep  pstrongOrder after change order has been addedstrongbr codeOrder Headercodebr code Version  2codep  pcodeOrder Detailcodebr code Version  1 Part  Acodebr code Version  1 Part  Bcodebr code Version  2 Part  Acodebr code Version  2 Part  Bcodebr code Version  2 Part  Ccode  p  pThis would be great, but I to track what was only part of original order, what was only part of version 1, etc.  Your idea looks good, but will not clearly show if Version 2 Part B was edited or not without comparing it to Version 1 Part B.  p  pI took your idea one step further.

Negative 369 pI had to move my WordPress site over and did some house cleaning of the media and then ran a plugin to reinsert the cleaned media into the database.

Negative 369 pIn many flavors of SQL, there are three ways you can implicitly set a column to NULL on every row insertion. These arep  precodecolumnname type NULL columnname type DEFAULT NULL columnname type NULL DEFAULT NULL codepre  pi.e. the first one sets the NULL flag as opposed to NOT NULL, second one leaves the NULL flag to the default value, and the third one sets the NULL flag and sets the implicit value as NULL.p  pIve heard about how in Microsoft SQL, the second variation is not exactly the same since you can also customize the default value of the NULL flag for tables or schemas.p  pBut for MySQL, I dont believe there is such a feature. In addition, in MySQL, columns with the NULL flag, unlike NOT NULL columns, always are implicitly set to NULL on insert if there is no explicit value, even if strict mode is turned on. So that leaves all these column declarations identical.p  pIn my MySQL script, for every NOT NULL column, I specify a DEFAULT value for columns I dont expect to set in some insertions in my application, to avoid any issues if I were to enable strict mode. Thus, I feel it would be more symmetrical if I were to choose the third variation, even though it is the most verbose and explicit. Are declarations like the third variation common, or does the first or second variation occur more frequently in others scriptsp  pI was considering leaning to the second approach because thats the alias that MySQL dump uses, but Im not sure thats such a good idea since it also dumps integer literals as strings single quotes in default clauses of column declarations.p  pThis question may appear to be more opinion than one that has a solution, but I also want to be aware of any potential gotchas that I am not aware of. I may choose to migrate from MySQL to PostgreSQL in the future, and I also could use some advice from those experts, e.g. if PostgreSQL distinguishes these cases like MSSQL does. Correct me if I am wrong if I made any incorrect assumptions.p

Negative 369 pIm trying to implement a concurrent producerconsumer queue with multiple producers and one consumer the producers add some data to the codeQueuecode, and the consumer dequeues these data from the queue in order to update a collection. This collection must be periodically backed up to a new file. For this purpose I created a custom serializable collection serialization could be performed by using the codeDataContractSerializercode.p  ul liThe queue is only shared between the consumer and the producers, so access to this queue must be managed to avoid race conditions.li liThe custom collection is shared between the consumer and a backup thread.li liThe backup thread could be activated periodically using a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comititlibrarysystem.threading.timer28vvs.10029.aspx relnofollowcodeSystem.Threading.Timercodea object it may initially be scheduled by the consumer, and then it would be scheduled at the end of every backup procedure.li liFinally, a shutdown method should stop the queuing by producers, then stop the consumer, perform the last backup and dispose the timer.li ul  pThe dequeuing of an item at a time may not be efficient, so I thought of using two queues when the first queue becomes full, the producers notify the consumer by invoking codeMonitor.Pulsecode. As soon as the consumer receives the notification, the queues are swapped, so while producers enqueue new items, the consumer can process the previous ones.p  pThe sample that I wrote seems to work properly.

Android 2.3p  pWhen i click on an element, i use backbone.js router to get the resources involved e.g. productid means I must show data about product with specified id  I get the data from localStorage was previously saved, filter the data, send it to a template to generate the html, and modify the DOM to update the view.p  pWhen the app runs in the mobile device there is a small delay between clicking the element and the page actually reflecting the new state. Thats not a terrible issue, but i need to provide some feedback to the user so Im trying to show the page loading indicator whenever the user clicks on some elements, before changing the view state. Thats when I hit a wall...p  pstrongThe problemstrong If I register an event handler for the click elements involved, the page loading never shows, as after finishing the event handler code, the default action for the click handler takes place and the view is not redraw. Using setTimeout doesnt help neither, as in that case the calculations start and the indicator is shown after they finish, i.e. when the page is actually in the new state, so the indicator either doesnt even show, or just show briefly before being dismissed.p  pIve tried almost any solution I could though ofp  ul lishow the indicator in the clickmousedowntapdown events  Tried this, but for some reason the click event is sometimes NOT triggeredli ul  pRouting works ok, but, the moment I add a code like thisp  precode document.bindclick, functionelement      .mobile.showPageLoadingMsg    codepre  pThen it starts to drop click events the loading indicator is shown, but the routing does even takes place. If I do not use that code, all works ok.p  ul liUsing a fastclick code httpsgithub.comcargomediajquery.touchToClick to intercept the click event and show the indicator and then  trigger the click event in the element manually again, sometimes the manually triggered click event just doesnt shows up li ul  pAny ideas I must be missing something p

When a user updates a row in codeLiveTablecode, I want to log the rows prior values in the history table.  This is simple enough with an codeUPDATEcode trigger, of course.

Negative 369 h1Summaryh1  pWhat Id like to accomplish is to periodically push a embareem Git repository into Subversion so others can examine it, using an unattended script. I dont need the opposite direction, SVN  Git.p  pI hope someone will help me get this done.

I have multiple machines, I do lots of speculative branching, and I commit frequently. Also, Xcode just works better with Git. Our SVN administrator agrees that Git is all but nonnegotiable for me. Ive been doing this by keeping a bare repo on my desktop machine owned by my employer and on its premises which all working copies track.p  pMy employer would really prefer I didnt do that if he could provide an ITgrade Git server, he would. His compromise is that I find a way to get a codelaunchdcode codecroncode task to sync my desktops bare Git repo to a parallel repo on the SVN server.p  h1My proposed approach probably unsatisfactoryh1  pI havent found any guides to cloning bare Git repos to Subversion, still less doing it unattended.

Git authentication would not be an issue, as the codedonttouchcode working copy would be owned by the same user as the bare repo, and can be reached by codefilecode.p  pBut my impression of syncing Git to SVN is that it is fragile, and will need interactive nips and tucks to avoid damaging the SVN repo, much less simply getting it to work.p

Negative 369 pIve started to learn about keyframe animation in CSS3. One think Ive noticed is that, no matter how I time things with keyframe animations, the transitions are always smooth.p  pFor example a background color change from 50 to 100, is a smooth transition as the animation plays from 50 to 100.p  pWhat Im trying to achieve is a way of doing the animation with an instant type of value change..p  pAgain, an example would be If 50 value of BG is red and 100 value of BG is blue the animation should stay red till it reaches to 100 and instantly changes to blue when it is 100 completed.p  pIm not sure if my terminology is right or wrong, but some direction would be perfect in any case.p

Negative 369 phalo there, p  pI am using VS 2010 and I have a winform client app and a wcf service. From my client, i will call wcf service. I implemented callback functionality and using netnamedpipe binding. I called a service method. This method is having a list of UserAccount object inside. This method will iterate through each UserAccount object and call a long runing propcess. At the end of each process, it will fire the event [callback] to notify the status of process. I am planning to do using a background worker for each process of UserAccount object. But Rx reactive framework is having something more credible functionalities which meets this requirement. Is there any parallel execution is possible in this case using RX  I just invoke the wcf service call. The service method is doing all these long running process and report each process status back to the client code [where callback is implemented in the client].p  precode1. Client gt Wcf gt wcf.DoLongRunning gt  2. foreach UserAccount usr in UserAccountLists   Is there anyway to avoid looping             class A  new class         call A.Method1usr and A.Method2usr  call these 2 methods parallel.         these 2 methods have return values. how to handle that one also in Rx         codepre  pThis seems parallel execution inside parallel execution.p  pCan anyone suggest a good approach for this functionality using Rx or any threading model.

Negative 369 pAs the title suggests Im looking for a better Chrome extension development environment. Im using Sublime Text 2 for my IDE, which is fine. The problem lies with testing the extension. Right now, when I need to test the code Ive written I first have to launch Chrome with the enableeasyoffstoreextensioninstall parameter. Then I need to package it through Chrome as an .crx file. Finally I have to drag and drop the file into Chrome and manually install it. Obviously this can get very time consuming very quickly.p  pI know I can test an extension as an unpacked extension, but this causes permission errors which is a problem since I need to perform CORs. Is there a better way to test extensions in Chrome p

Negative 369 pIm developing a CMS using Symfony2 where a user can add multiple pages for their website. This could be from the About Us page to the News page. Some pages will have different templates, for example the About Us page will use a pretty simple, generic master template whereas the News page will use a listing template so that it can show a list of news articles. p  pEach page entity contains a title, url, content, livedate, expiredate, seotitle, seokeywords and seodescription as all pages will require this information. I also have a template entity which consists of name, controller, action and view. Therefore, a Master template could contain the PageController, detailAction and master.twig.html file as its view. However a Listing template could contain the PageController, listingActin and list.twig.html file. This is just an example. p  pTherefore, when looking at routing the front end I will initally need to get the page properties by url so I can populate the seo meta data, and the title and content of the page, however how should I then route the page to its applicable controller, action and view I assume I wouldnt want them all within the PageController p
Negative 369 pThis problem might seem very basic but I couldnt find an answer to it. I need to place an imageView in a special position in the screen. Suppose, I need it to be three tenth from the top, and one fifth from the left of the screen.p  pThe first thing that comes to mind is to use an AbsoluteLayout and place the imageView using absolute coordinates. However this method causes problems in working with different screen sizes. The problem is that I can not get the screen dimensions width and height in the xml file, and on the other hand, I couldnt find a setX  setY or similar method for ImageView to do it programatically.p  pAn idea to solve this problem was using LinearLayout instead of AbsoluteLayout and to insert dummy views like textVies to fill the space behind or above my desired imageView. But this gets complicated if I have multiple imageViews to place in the screen and if the desired positions are not aligned. Another solution was using padding or margin, but it didnt work with the AbsoluteView.p

So, I couldnt figure it out yet, Im probably missing something p  pAn example code I use is like below   p  precodePGresult    res const char  paramValues[1]  plateImageArray.data  data type is const char int          paramLengths[1]  plateImageArray.size  size of image is 58573 bytes int          paramFormats[1]  1  1 for byte, 0 for text  res  PQexecParamsconn,         INSERT INTO plates plateImage VALUES 1bytea,         1,                param number          NULL,             param type          paramValues,      param values         paramLengths,     param lengths          paramFormats,     default to all text params          1               return type, 1 for text.   res  PQexecconn,Select  from plateimages WHERE .... returns 1 tuple  something  something  imagebytea   int lengthOfPlateImagePQgetlengthres,0,2  indicates 117148 bytes, exactly 2 times of sent data 2  codepre  pI appreciate if you guys help me. Im deadly bored of searching about the reason of it.p  pThanks in advance.p  pEdit I tracked the data stored in disk and the size of inserted data is the same 58573 byte. Two times bigger data becomes while getting it ...p

Negative 369 pI have in front of me some code that Im not quite sure I think is ok. A critical section is put into a codeautoptrcode and codeDeleteCriticalSectioncode is never called on it. But I seem to remember that instances of codeCRITICALSECTIONcode should only be modified with the critical section functions. I tried running this through a memory leak check and it complained.p  pThis is of course part of a multi threaded system and access to the critical section is done in several places. But if I trim it down this is basically how the codeCRTITCALSECTIONcodeis treated now.p  precodevoid test    autoptrltCRITICALSECTIONgt foo   foo.resetnew CRITICALSECTION   InitializeCriticalSectionfoo.get   codepre  pSince I dont belive the codeautoptrcode going out of scope correctly delets the critical section I tried to quickly change this to p  precodevoid test    autoptrltCRITICALSECTIONgt foo   foo.resetnew CRITICALSECTION   InitializeCriticalSectionfoo.get    DeleteCriticalSectionfoo.get  codepre  pand the memory leak detection became much happier. The critical sections exists until the application shut down. So should I take the time to update the code to use codeDeleteCriticalSectioncode to actually delete the critical section, or just live with the fact that the application shuts down and releases all memory anywayp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pAnswer to emWhozCraigem Yes, looking at it several instances of objects containing a critical section can be alive at any given time and cant share a single global critical section.p

Negative 369 pIm new to Ring and Clojure serverside programming in general. I have a Ringbased app that works well in development mode, i.e. it can listen on codelocalhost3000code and it responds appropriately.

Negative 369 pemrephrased for clarityemp  pI would like to be able to mix the use of the synchronized block with more explicit locking via calling lock and release methods directly when appropriate.  Thus allowing me the syntaxtical sugar of using sychtronizedmyObject when I can get away with it, but also being able to call myObject.lock amp myObject.unlock dierctly for those times when a synchronized block is not flexible enough to do what I need done.  p  pI know that every single Object has, implicitly, a rentrant lock built into it which is used by the synchronized block.  Effectively the the lock mthod is caled on the Objects internal reentrant lock every time one enters a sychronized block, and unlock is called on the same reentrant lock when you leave the synchronized block.  I would seem as if it wouldn be easy enough to allow one the ability to manually lockunlock this inplicit reentrant lock thus allowing a mixing of synchronized blocks and explcit locking.p  pHowever, as far as I know there is no way to do this.  And because of the way synchronized blocks work I dont believe there is a convenient way to mix them with explicit locking othewrise.  It seems as if this would be a rather convenient, and easily added by expending the Object api to add lockunlock methods.p  pThe question I have is, why doesnt this exist  Im certain there is a reason, but I dont know what it is.  I thought the issue may be with encapsulation same reason you dont want to do synchronizethis.  However, if I am already calling sycnhronizedmyObject then by defination anyone who knows about myObject can likewise synchronize on it and cause a deadlock if done foolishly.  The question of encapsulation comes down to who can access the object you synchronized on regardless of rather you use a sychtronized block or manually locked the object at least as I see it.  So is there some other advantage to not allowing one to manually lock an objectp
Negative 369 pIm currently doing research for sentiment analysis in twitter. i want to combine predefined lexicon resource like sentiwordnet polarity score. and then proceed it with machine learning. the problem is in getting the correct score of sentiwordnet, previous work always simply choose by the total score of negative and positive polarity of the word meaning. i mean for example the word mad can appear 3 times as negative and 2 times as positive words. most of previous work will automatically average of each polarity. so i want to disambiguate the words before getting the score so we can really use the sentiwordnet as it should be. i was thinking by comparing the similarity of target sentence and gloss sentence.. is there any method to compare it do you think it will works if not please share your idea..p  pim completely new to this field and novice python programmer, so i really need advice from you.. thank you..p

Lets say in the scenario below. the enemy might turn all the way around in the wrong direction.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuKAUg.png altenter image description herep  pMy code below keeps getting longer and Im still having issues.

Negative 369 pIm trying to write a nontrivial Hive job using the Hive Thrift and JDBC interfaces, and Im having trouble setting up a decent JUnit test.

Negative 369 pSo the title basically speaks for itself. Ive seen other posts about this problem but seems like no one answers to it. Anyway, Id like to send SMS to Androidx86 on the virtualbox, something like telnet it Just like how you can do it using the traditional AVD.p  pAVD emulator runs really slow on my machine as Im using a Windows 7 and AMD Athlon II with only 3GB. And as you can read online, speeding up requires an Intel supporting VTx. Any thought would be much appreciated. thanks.p

Negative 369 pIn order to monitor changes uploaded to Gerrit in Jenkins, I used the Gerrit Trigger Plugin to accomplish it. And by setting project and branch information, I can monitor the a specific branch within a specific project. br br However, I have an unusual demand. For example br 1. Project A has three branch named master, devfeatureone and devfeaturetwo. br 2. Now, I need to monitor changes from these branches except devfeaturetwo. br brp  pSo I used RegExp type to specify the branch pattern with value devfeaturetwo. to filter out the devfeaturetwo branch, however, this didnt work and the Gerrit Trigger Plugin can capture changes under all the three branches. br br But if I used value . to monitor all these branches to do a testing of RegExp, it works this time. br br So I confused by the RegExp checking of Gerrit Trigger Plugin, and I doubt that if there is no support for the lookahead regular expression. br br If you are familiar about the Gerrit Trigger Plugin, could you offer me some help. br Thank you advance.p
Negative 369 pIm having some issues with garbage collection in Chrome.

Negative 369 pmy logfiles are full of tabs at the end of each row. The Problem is, that I need the tabs before, for the logfile to be readable.

But then I still have 1 tab at the end of each row and since I have a lot of logfiles and they are very long it would take me forever to delete those manually.p  pCan someone give me a function or skript to delete tabs after the last character of each row the rows do not end at the same column.p  pThanks a lotp

Negative 369 pSo I have here a program that simply mimics checkers but instead of jumping, one piece simply eats another piece. I have a simple class that implements a Checkers class object and creates an int array variable called chips there is a WHILE statements that creates a loop while chip[0] and chips[1] integers are greater than 0. it looks like thisp  precodepublic static void mainString [] args          Checkers c  new Checkers         c.init         c.printBoard         int[] chips  c.count         Scanner kbd  new ScannerSystem.in         whilechips[0]gt0 ampamp chips[1]gt0             System.out.printlnnYour move 4 ints src row, src col, dest row, dest col separated by [SPACE]             int srcR  kbd.nextInt             int srcC  kbd.nextInt             int destR  kbd.nextInt             int destC  kbd.nextInt             kbd.nextLine             c.movesrcR,srcC,destR,destC             c.printBoard             System.out.printlnc.getMessage             c.count               codepre  pMy count method in the Checkers class looks like thisp  precodepublic int[] count         int wht0     int blk0      System.out.println      forint i0 iltboard.lengthi             forint z0 zltboard[0].lengthz                  ifboard[i][z] instanceof White                     wht                          else ifboard[i][z] instanceof Black                    blk                                 int[] arr  wht,blk       System.out.printlnWhites whtnBlacks blk           return arr     codepre  pThe board is 8 x 8 which is what board.length is, and the count method is simply to return the value of arr so that it can report back to chips to decide whether or not chips[1] and chips[0] are both greater than one that they both have at least one White or Black pieces on the board. the array is only supposed to consist of two values ie. white,black  Ive tried reformatting the entire count in various ways, but this is only one of a few ways that the code compiles. p  phere is the outputp  p01234567p  p0........ p  p1..B.....p  p2........p  p3........p  p4........p  p5..B.B.B.p  p6.B.B.B.Bp  pAs you can see there are no White pieces any longer supposed to be at the top. I would appreciate help considering this is probably an easy fix staring right under my nose but it is annoying, so I hope I explained this well enough. Thank you. p  poh btw, I was told not to touch the main method at all.  p
Negative 369 pIve created a demo PhoneGap application, that checks acceleration, compass and geolocation and presents these info to user. Application was compiled using PhoneGap Build.p  pI used simple codetoFixedncode and some strings to round value and add some unit after it. This worked just great in case of acceleration and compass. For some reason beyond my imaggination, this fails in case of geolocation at least on Galaxy Nexus  Android 4.3.p  pI used such functionp  precodefunction onGeolocationSuccessposition      console.logposition      var coords  position.coords      coords.latitude  coords.latitude.toFixed6     coords.longitude  coords.longitude.toFixed6     coords.altitude  coords.altitude.toFixed2   m     coords.accuracy  coords.accuracy.toFixed6   m     coords.altitudeAccuracy  coords.altitudeAccuracy.toFixed2   m     coords.heading  coords.heading.toFixed2  u00b0     coords.speed  coords.speed.toFixed2   ms      var geoText  Longitude is   coords.longitude  .      geoText  geoText  Latitude is   coords.latitude  .     geoText  geoText  Accuracy is   coords.accuracy  .     geoText  geoText  Altitude is   coords.altitude  .     geoText  geoText  Altitude Accuracy is   coords.altitudeAccuracy  .     geoText  geoText  Heading is   coords.heading  .     geoText  geoText  Speed is   coords.speed  .      positionText.htmlgeoText  codepre  pIt is passed as codesuccesscode callback of PhoneGaps codenavigator.geolocation.watchPositioncode.p  pFunction fires, entire position object is written to console and thats all. If lines between codevar coords  position.coordscode and codevar geoText  Longitude is   coords.longitude  .code are strongnot commentedstrong, function execution dies somewhere in between, line codepositionText.htmlgeoTextcode is not being executed and codepositionTextcode div is not being updated correctly.p  pIf I comment out these seven rounding lines all is fine and div is being updated. The same rounding works like a charm in case of acceleration and compass object, which makes this even more strange.p  pCan someone tell me, what am I missing Why PhoneGap geolocation object doesnt like rounding, while compass and acceleration objects goes fine with thisp

Negative 369 pLets say there is a generic method declaration that performs a set of operations based upon a designated mode that would look something like thisp  precodedef doSomethingSmartmode OpMode, someGoodyList List[Any] Boolean    do foo   codepre  pWhere OpMode is a typeenumeration consisting ofbrp  ol liReadli liCreateli liDeleteli liModifyli liWhateverli ol  pPutting the two together would obviously yield a singlemode, reusable, code block.brp  pNow, the typeenumeration part would probably look something like thisp  precodeobject OpMode extends Enumeration    type OpMode  Value   val Read, Write, Create, Modify, Delete, Whatever  Value  codepre  pBut lets say you wanted to expand the scope of doSomethingSmart to span what is typically done using bitwise operators, for example Create amp Modify amp Whatever.

In the words of Rodney King, Cant we all just get alongp  pFor some background, when I first got my Mac about a year ago, I had no idea what I was doing. I was also using macports, which was, as the Homebrew website seems to be cognizant, driving me to become a raging alcoholic. As a result, my codeusrlocalcode directory got wayyy fed up. Eventually, gcc and g stopped working, and a lot of other things were breaking. So I did a clean install of OS X, and I want my shiny new installation to stay a little more organized.p  pNow, Ive installed Apples Command Line Tools, and all the binarieslibrariesetc have ended up in codeusrlocalcode. Thats fine, but then I try to install homebrew, and its also putting everything in the usrlocal directory.

They sayp  pDo yourself a favor and install to codeusrlocalcode. Some things may not build when installed elsewhere. One of the reasons Homebrew just works relative to the competition is because we recommend installing to codeusrlocalcode. Pick another prefix at your perilp  pThe whole point is that I dont want to bother with micromanaging every package I install, and I dont want my filesystem to become an ungodly mess either. Anyone have any suggestions Do I move command line tools to a different directory and add this to my PATH Any tips would be much appreciated.p

Negative 369 pI have two events wired to a control. A mouse click event plays an audio file. A drag event made up from mouse down, mouse move and mouse up drags the control vertically.  By dragging the control vertically the control get assigned a different song. The problem I have is that when I drag the control the music plays. I do not want this since this is a dragging operation. Music should play only when control is clicked and note moved. I think that setting boundaries, e.g. when control moves only 5 pixels play sound otherwise drag control should solve the problem but I tried to create them unsuccessfully.p  pCan you please guide how to solve this problem preferably with code snippets.

Negative 369 pThinking that MODULE structures and names often reflect much earlier forms of the model than the classes do.  What is the best practice regarding domain modularisation  p  pFor Example A simple domain for cars engines and customers of engines and cars.  p  pAggregate 1 Engine  p  pAggregate 2 Car with the following contained objects Wheel, Position, Tire  p  pAggregate 3 Customer  p  pShould the domain be modularised based on the aggregate roots That is, the car module contains the corespondent aggregate with factories repositories etc, customer module the corespondent aggregate and so on.  p  pOr should it be modularised based on some other factors And if yes, is it a good thing to scatter aggregate objects in different modules  p  pFor further clarification, here is my response to MikeSWs comment p  pKnowing that the domain might evolve in time, some Agile thought should be implemented in the domain. This leads to modularisation. Im novice regarding how Agile development works also not very experienced with DDD. But I know modularisation should follow some patterns this is where my expression best practice come from. p  pFor starter its not clear if an aggregate should really represent a chapter in a user story of course it might. But there are some cases when it doesnt. So in this case should a module include parts of aggregates or whole aggregates for domain sakep

Negative 369 pI have a ASP.Net MVC controller and it calls a method that will post a purchase order.  However I want the purchase order posting to take place in the background, I dont want the controller to wait for the purchase order to post before returning.  The posting takes a long time and there really is nothing the user of the website can do if there is a error, somebody else needs to be alerted.p  pIt seemed like a good case for using the C await and async functionality, but I am struggling to get it to work.  I tried to setup the method that posts the purchase order as a asynchronous method.  However I am running into the following problemsp  ul liThe class that has the method that post the purchase order implements a interface.  The controller is using the interface and you cannot put async on a method in a interface.  So I tried to resolve this by having the method return a Task.li liThe method to post the purchase order is not running asynchronously, it is running synchronously like a normal method.li ul  pWhat am I doing wrong  Here is the codep  precodepublic class POReceivingController  Controller      IPOReceivingService poservice      public POReceivingControllerIPOReceivingService poserviceparm              poservice  poserviceparm           public ActionResult PostPOstring shipmentid              poservice.PostPOAsyncshipmentid        public interface IPOReceivingService      Task PostPOAsyncstring shipmentidparm   public class POReceivingService  IPOReceivingService      public async Task PostPOAsyncstring shipmentidparm               Code to post PO and alert correct people if there is an error.       codepre

Negative 369 pI was wondering if I can use the active cell, by that I mean the cell that is highlighted at a given time with the square border after there was a mouse click there, as an argument in a function.p  pFor example, I have created a table with weighted averages with 3 weights w1 is given in the column headers kindly see the file below, w2 in the row headers, and w3 which complements w1 and w2 to 1.p  pWhat Id like to do is have cells outside the table show the weights the average got when a cell in the table is selected.p  pFor example Screenshot a hrefhttpimgur.comemmBH5S relnofollowhttpimgur.comemmBH5Sap  pfile can be found here a hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0B700fdslR7Tm11ODRVS296ckk relnofollowhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0B700fdslR7Tm11ODRVS296ckkap  pHere we see the cell K12 is active, and for K12 w10.2, w20.15, and so, the cells in the weights tables above rows 34 get the appropriate values according to the weights in the active cell. of course I manually created this one for illustration purposesp  pIs there a way to do that Preferably without VBA if possible  Couldnt find anything very useful...p  pThanks in advance A p

Negative 369 pI have a function to give recommendations to users. This function need to make a lot of calcs to start, but after start it use the already calculed matrix on memory. After this, any other calc that is made, fills the object in memory to continuous learning. My intention is to use this function to website users, but the response need to come from the same object in memory and need to be sequential by request because it is not thread safe. How is the best way to get this working My first idea was use signalr so the user dont need to wait to response and a queue to send the requests to objects. But how the signalr can receive the response for this specific request The entire flow is User enter on a page. A javascript will call a service with the user ID and actual page. The server will queue the ID an page. The service will be calculating the results for each request on queue and sending responses. The server will receive the response and send back to client.p  pThe main problem is that I dont see a way to the service receive the response to send back to client until it is complete, without need to be looping in queues.p  pThanksp

Negative 369 pSo I have a typeahead. You have a schedule and you start typing a class and the dropdown on the input will show what classes are available in your schedule. However, if they are not in the schedule, I dont want the user to be able to submit it.

Negative 369 pI am currently writing my first Wordpress plugin. Since I am pretty sure this will not be my last one I try to put as much code as possible into common code files for later reuse in other plugins.p  pI am using namespaces and OOP programming to allow the code beeing reused like I do in my C projects as far as PHP allows to do so.p  pHowever in WPPHP there is a problem with no obvious solution Where should I place the shared code files Wordpress kind of merges all the code in a global application. So copying code into each plugin folder could mean potential collisions andor random use of code files with same content but different stages of development. Also this would create ugly redundancies.p  pI did not find a dedicated central storage place.p  pPlacing the shared code in the plugins folder is a bad idea since each shared code file would be considered a separate plugin.p  pI could add all the shared code by means of a special library plugin afaik this would make the contained code visible to all other plugins but this seem kind of weird. Also I am not sure if this would be reliable .p  pWhat is the best solutionp

After getting this to work, What I tried to do was change the code so instead of just using the tree variable, I wanted to iterate through a list of widgets, so that if my character runs into any of them, my character stops moving. Whats strange is that it works when I have only one widget in the list. For example if I put list[0] or list[1] in my code, then my character will stop when encountering those widgets. But again, if I have more than one widget in the list and try to iterate through the list, it does not work, my character does not stop when encountering any of the widgets.p  pIm guessing I did something wrong with the for loop. Ultimately I want it so that if my character runs into any of the images in the list, the character will stop moving.p  pHere is a snippet of my for loop, and below I have included the entire code if that helps.p  pSnippetp  precodedef onkeyboarddownself, keyboard, keycode, text, modifiers     if keycode[1]  left         self.source  selectionscreenleft.zip         self.animdelay.20         if self.x lt Window.width  .25             bglayout.x  4         else             for i in listofwidgets                 if self.collidewidgeti                     self.x 0                 else                     self.x 6 codepre  pFull Codep  precodefrom kivy.app import App from kivy.uix.widget import Widget from kivy.uix.image import Image from kivy.core.window import Window from kivy.uix.screenmanager import ScreenManager, Screen from kivy.uix.label import Label from kivy.uix.behaviors import ButtonBehavior from kivy.core.audio import SoundLoader from kivy.uix.relativelayout import RelativeLayout from kivy.uix.floatlayout import FloatLayout from kivy.uix.gridlayout import GridLayout from kivy.uix.screenmanager import FallOutTransition from kivy.clock import Clock from kivy.graphics import Color    gamelayout  FloatLayoutsize300, 300 bglayout  FloatLayout characterselectionlayout  GridLayoutcols2   class GameScreen  class BgImage      def initself, kwargs         superBg, self.initkwargs         self.allowstretch  True         self.sizehint  None, None         self.size  1440, 1440    class NpcsImage     def initself, kwargs         superNpcs, self.initkwargs         self.allowstretchTrue       class MoveableImageImage      def initself, kwargs         superMoveableImage, self.initkwargs         self.keyboard  Window.requestkeyboardNone, self         if not self.keyboard             return         self.keyboard.bindonkeydownself.onkeyboarddown         self.keyboard.bindonkeyupself.onkeyboardup          self.y  Window.height2.1         self.app  App.getrunningapp        def onkeyboarddownself, keyboard, keycode, text, modifiers         if keycode[1]  left             self.source  selectionscreenleft.zip             self.animdelay.20             if self.x lt Window.width  .25                 bglayout.x  4             else                 for i in listofwidgets                     if self.collidewidgeti                         self.x 0                     else                         self.x 6          elif keycode[1]  right             self.source selectionscreenright.zip             self.animdelay.20             if self.x gt Window.width  .70                 bglayout.x  4             else                 for i in listofwidgets                     if self.collidewidgeti                         self.x  0                     else                         self.x  6          else             return False         return True   class gameAppApp     def buildself         global sm          sm  ScreenManager         game  Gamenamegame         sm.addwidgetgame         global listofobject         listofobject  []         hero  MoveableImagesourceselectionscreenright1.png, sizehintNone,None, allowstretch  False, size40, 65         self.tree  Npcssourceselectionscreentree.zip, allowstretchFalse, sizehintNone,None, poshintx.20, y.30, size50, 50, pos300, 300         self.testdude  Npcssourceselectionscreentestdude.png, allowstretchFalse, sizehintNone,None, poshintx.60, y.70, size100, 124, pos800, 900         listofwidgets.appendself.tree         listofwidgets.appendself.testdude         self.backgroundBgsourceselectionscreenbackground12.png, poshintx0, y0         bglayout.addwidgetself.background         bglayout.addwidgetself.tree         bglayout.addwidgetself.testdude         gamelayout.addwidgetbglayout         gamelayout.addwidgethero         game.addwidgetgamelayout          return sm      if name  main     gameApp.run codepre

Negative 369 pI need to write an XML Schema that will allow for the production of an XML file that needs to be in a very specific format.

Negative 369 pEveryone knows that default inbuild Excel notification about current user with writing access to excel file at server with access from multiple users DOES NOT WORK properly.

And thus once the first person leave the excel, the second gain the option to get the file for writing, but the text file with his username is not created see the attached code and thus the another user, opening the same excel file, will not know about current writing user.p  pDoes anyone have please any idea how to correct this behavior in the .xlsm file I guess the only way to correct it is to find out some subroutine, which is triggered once the user is reopening excel file for writing.p

Negative 369 pRecently, we found that some of our SpringMVC based sites pages, that accept query parameters, are susceptible to XSS attacks. For e.g. a url like codehttpwww.oursite.compagesconsole.logdocument.cookieampa1ampfx326tTDEcode could result in the injected JS to be executed in the context of the rendered page. These pages are all GETbased, no POST requests are supported.p  pThese parameters are written in the markup in numerous places, so doing an HTML encode in all these places would be tedious and require more code changes. In some cases, they are also written to cookies.p  pIdeally, we would want to emdetectem them as early as possible, say inside a codeServlet FilterSpring Interceptorcode and then for emeach request parameterem, decide if we want to drop it all together, or sanitize it in some way, before its available to the rest of the application. We would want this decision to be configurable as well, so that the approach to handle a particular request parameter can be modified over time without significant code change.p  pNow, since these are request parameters that we want to potentially modify, we would probably have to use an approach similar to the one described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1413129modifyrequestparameterwithservletfilterherea, if we go the Filter way. We would potentially want to sanitize HTTP Request Headers similarly too.p  pSo, what would be the most flexibleminimum overhead way to handle this situation Would codeESAPIcode be able to both detect and sanitize them, in a configurable way Its not clear from its API as to what is possible. We would definitely not want to handroll regexes to do this. Also, would a Filter be the right place to handle thisp  pThanks.p

Negative 369 pI have a question regarding something Im seeing in some VB.NET code on a project that Ive had to take over.  In a form the developer has declared a very simple 15sec timer.p  precodePrivate WithEvents mtmrManualDecision As New System.Timers.Timer15000 codepre  pNow, I know that this timer will trigger the mtmrManualDecisionElapsed event each 15 seconds after it has been started via mtmrManualDecision.Start.  Im also familiar with stopping this timer via mtmrManualDecision.Stop.  However, Im seeing this line of code in parts of the form like when a button is clicked or the form is closed.p  precodeRemoveHandler mtmrEvaluation.Elapsed, AddressOf mtmrEvaluationElapsed codepre  pI believe this is basically stopping the timer.  Why do this instead of just stop  Its not being added back or used again after this so Im wondering why the need to do this.  I dont normally use RemoveHandler unless I actually used AddHandler in my own code. I believe that the declaration of the timer using WithEvents automatically adds a handler for the Elapsed event and he just wants to remove it.  Is this really necessary and wouldnt the garbage collection take care of removing the handler like it does with other events, etc.p  pAny clarification or ideas would be appreciated.  Thank you very much.p
Negative 369 pId like to either disable the VTK warning window or, better yet, catch them to handle with my applications logging system.  My application is using an embedded mayavi view, and I dont want error windows popping up that I have no control over.

Better yet the followingcode  will log the warnings to a file found it a hrefhttpnullege.comcodesshowsrcbibioimagexdHEADmayavitrunkvtkPipelinetestparser.py130vtkpython.vtkFileOutputWindow relnofollowhereap  precodedef redirectvtkmessages       Can be used to redirect VTK related error messages to a     file.     import tempfile     tempfile.template  vtkerr     f  tempfile.mktemp.log     log  vtkpython.vtkFileOutputWindow     log.SetFlush1     log.SetFileNamef     log.SetInstancelog codepre  pSo while this is nice, Im still unable to pipe the warnings directly into a logging handler.  Id rather not have to have a vtklog file next to my regular log files.  Also I might want to handle the warnings in my GUI somehow, or give the user options on how to handle them and constantly watching a log file for changes seems like a poor way to do that.p  pAny suggestions on a robust pythonic way to handle vtk warnings in an application which embeds mayavivtkp

Negative 369 pI have to take 1 Million records from Database and write it to an excel file. Because of complexity i cannot split the number of records. Currently I am storing the data in a List. Each bean in the List represents each row. Now, this is creating memory issues as we are keeping huge data in memory.  To deal with it, i am planning to write each row to a CSV file. Read the CSV file and write data to excel. So i dont have to keep it in memory. My only worry is about the time consumed by file operations. What you think Is it a better approach  Hope, using java.nio.FileChannel we can read file faster.p

The errorbar chart itself is coming out fine, but it bombs when I try to use a colormap, so I must be doing it wrong.

But when I try to do this p  pre classlanghtml prettyprintoverridecodeplt.errorbarxval, yval, yerryerr, colorcmap codepre    pit gives me an error, like  ValueError torgba Invalid rgba arg 0 b, 1 g, 2 c, 3 mp  pIs it possible to do what Im tryng to do Waht I am trying to do is to have each of the 4 points in the errorbar chart have a different color. I wouldnt need the line connecting the points really. Appreciate any helpadvice. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsJkSk.png alterrorbar chartp

Negative 369 pI want to grab a count of distinct ASNNOs from my query to later check in my stored procedure if i find more than one and throw an error.p  pInstead of trying to open the cursorwhich i was also failing at doing properly, i thought maybe i could do it with temp table selects and store the value while im populating the cursor.

Negative 369 pI want to store data to the database using Spring Data REST. The rational is that the DB may change from customer to customer and  we would not need to change aspects of the solution that are not stricly related to DB operations. In fact, the database service or implementation could even change without need to restart the application. p  pSpring Data REST seems to meet our need. Though I have a question that I am not able to see answered. p  pThe data we want to store may have different data formats. From one customer to the other one, new fields might be needed. For instance, for customer A, the Person instances might have 5 fields while for customer B, Person instances would have 8 fields.  I understand that with JPA, something like this would be difficult to support.p  pHowever, given NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra support this capability, I was wondering if there is a way to force Spring DATA to accept such additional fields without having to rebuild things. My guess is that I have to implement my own repository. Any less painful approachp
Negative 369 pI have a series of UIViewControllers in my app, and these are presented using a UINavigationController. The HOME ViewController calls pushViewController to get to the PROFILES ViewController. The PROFILES screen correctly shows the back button to HOME. Then selecting a button on PROFILES will take the user to the DETAIL ViewController. The DETAIL screen correctly shows the back button to PROFILES. But when I press the back button to PROFILES, I do indeed go back to the PROFILES screen but the navigation bar on that screen now shows the title HOME with no back button. In other words, it appears that IOS 8 has popped the ViewController once to go back from DETAIL to PROFILES, but has somehow popped the navigation bar items twicep  pAny idea how I can fix thisp

Negative 369 pI am using H2 for database management, and this is what I would like to dop  pI would like to allow multiple users to access a database at the same time. Ive read a bit about MULTITHREADEDTRUE, LOCKFILENO, and AUTOSERVERTRUE. Ive also read that LOCKFILENO can be dangerous, because it can corrupt the database. I definitely would not want this, so Im assuming that is a bad way to go. Ive also tried to close the connection immediately after a record is accessed, whether it is being read from or written to. So far, nothing seems to work. The application is not allowing me to read from or write to the database if the database has been connected to in a separate instance of the application ex on another computer. Once I completely close the application on one computer, I am able to access the database records.p  pHow do I allow multiple users to connect to the H2 database at the same time without compromising the safety of the databasep  pThank you in advance for any helpful responses.p

Negative 369 pI am pretty new to programming in IOS with Cocoa and I am using Swift. I fetch data from a JSON API using an NSURLSession data session with custom delegate, not closures. The reason for using custom delegate is that I have to do basic authentication and I also inject a custom cachecontrol header to control caching behavior my API doesnt include any caching related headers in the response at all.p  pAll this works perfectly but only for requests for which the URLSessiondataTaskdidReceiveData method is called only once. As soon as I get larger responses some 2030kBytes that call the didReceivedData method several times, the URLSessiondataTaskwillCacheResponsecompletionHandler method doesnt get called at all, and therefore my response doesnt get cached. Reissuing the same request within 5 minutes will issue a request to the server again, which doesnt happen for requests whose responses only call didReceiveData one single time.

Negative 369 pI have a web application using Marionette that frequently needs to render large trees of nested views.

Negative 369 pAfter further researches, I found that for making android apps with AIR technologies, it requires AIR runtime on the android device, and Flash professional CS5, then, youn can  publish your flash project under apk extension, even install it as an android application automatically after publishing it, if you are connecting your device via usb cable, and you are already installed the sdk tools with the usb connector package if youre on windows.p  pSo all of this is great, but, I only have the apk extension of the app, with a file called main.swf, i want to know  that if I use the Flash professional cs5 to open the main.swf file, will I be able to modify fields labels for example, and then translate the labels from english to french . if not, what is the right way to translate an app made  by Flash, when you only have the apk decompiled of the application containing the swf file p  pThank you for your answers, im here if you need any further explainaitions about my situation.p
Negative 369 pFirst off, this is in C using Unity3D free, I have no budget for the project. And honestly my skill level for C is not great, so detailed answers please Im making an app as a news feed for a guild, my only difficulty has been google calendar. What I need is to be able to get all the events for the month, then separate them into just description and a DateTime for when it occurs, in arrays that are in the same order, so I can sort it into a handmade calendar. So for example description[2] would be for datetime[2]. If there is an alternative calendar that will fit the circumstance better I can probably get it moved over, but Ill need instructions on how to parse it for the needed information.p  pUsing the googles API I was not able to make it get information without requiring login first, and even after that it tries to get the users calendar, not a specific public one.p  pI also tried to parse the XML version of the calendar using system.xml, which also failed and it would not recognize that it had any tags. however if I appended a tag to the start and end of it, I could get the entire thing as if it had no tags completely useless for what I need. Mind you I was able to use system.xml fine to parse the forums with some help from an old howto in a unity support forum.p  pI also tried using windows forums web browser thingy, and the gecko version. Unity does not like those at all and they seem to refuse to render, or maybe Im just using them wrong, Im not totally sure.p

Negative 369 pI have a datagridview dock as fill to a tablelayoutpanel, with no margins. What I want to do is change the location of the table cells inside the datagridview so that the row headers, column headers and cells are 5 pixels for the top, bottom and left. Basically, you will see the datagridview back color for 5 pixel from the top, bottom and left and then youll see the table cells. I know I can make the tablelayoutpanel the same color as the datagridview and then position the datagridview 5 pixels in, but the issue I have is the scrollbar, I still want the scroll bar to stretch the whole length of the tablelayoutpanel, which will not happen if I position the datagridview 5 pixels from the top, the scrollbar will stop 5 pixel from the top and bottom of the tablelayoutpanel.p  pAs Im only using the cells and not the headers, Ive been able to make the headers transparent and then setting them at 5 pixel, which works, but then I have the issue of the 5 pixels at the bottoms, which I can get.p  pSort of hard to explain, but hopefully this might make sense. If anybody has any ideas, Id very much appreciate to hear them, any help is good. thanks.p

Negative 369 pI have scoured the web, and cant find any good reports on this. I thought this would be a common question, but I may be wrong given the lack of data online.p  pWe are building a net new application, and are looking at different NoSQL backends.  The two with the most promise in terms of functionality, market adoption, performance are Azure Table Storage and MongoDB.  Theres no doubt that Azure Table Storage in way cheaper in the shortterm when your number of clients and number of IOps is low.  But Im very concerned about vendorlock ifwhen our app goes big, and now were forced to share a sizable chuck of monthly profits, especially if pricing goes up.p  pI was able to find some some reports on MongoDB host in Azure VMs versus Azure table storage, but they were all written by Microsoft Azure MVPs.  While I respect MS MVPs, thats not exactly an unbiased comparison, and isnt what Im looking for.  Im looking for a comparison between Azure Table storage, versus a MongoDB cluster hosted in a Colo.  For example, Ive read come compelling configs with people running Hadoop or Mongo on SuperMicro 2U machines with 24x internal drives that have amazing IOPs performance and all the same scaleout benefits of Azure Table Storage.p  pSo long story shorter, Im not surprised that Mongo on Azure VMs are more expensive than Azure table storage. That makes total sense given the way IaaS providers makes money on Table Storage versus VMs.p  pMy question is at what point if ever do inexpensive Mongo nodes in a lowcost hosted data center become cheaper than the monthly cost of Azure Table Storage.  Because thats the entire point of Mongo, right Your hardware amp hosting costs should be a fraction of traditional RDBMS apps since you dont need highend hosting, expensive SAN storage, etc.  Its intended to be a true clustered data storage system with many inexpensive, redundant nodes.p  pORp  pIf you believe my comparison of MongoDB and Azure Table Storage is fundamentally flawed meaning they do not have a comparable featuresets, then I would love to hear those arguments as well.p  pThanks all,p

Negative 369 pIn just intonation theory, a type of music theory, intervals between notes are expressed with rational numbers. Doubling a frequency with a 21 ratio brings it up an octave and a 11 ratio is no change a unison. So if I have an interval emnem that is larger than an octave or smaller than a unison it goes down, it is useful to justify it. That is, to make 1  emnem  2. Ive been doing this in Python with the following functionp  precodedef justifyn     return n  2  floor logn,2  codepre  pThe actual function involves the fractions library, but this gets the job done with floats and ints. The log finds to what power of 2 emnem is and floor rounds it down so that the resulting divisor is the nearest power of 2 below emnem. Ive also tried thisp  precodedef justifyn     return n  int 1.ljust len binn   2, 0 , 2  codepre  pThis one just take the length of the binary representation and pads zeroes based on that. Of course, that only works with ints. I was wondering if there is any way to perform this operation with bitwise operations. It seems like the binary would lend itself well to the power of 2 operation. At minimum, I would like to see a way to replace code2  floor logn,2 code with something bitwise. Extra points if it can handle floats, but I understand thats more complicated.p

Negative 369 pI could not find a conclusive answer to my issue so I decided to post my first question on this site. Im fairly new to programming and have been using Qt for a couple of months now.

Im displaying the number of ports available with the codep  precodeqDebug ltlt Number of serial ports ltlt QSerialPortInfoavailablePorts.count  codepre  pMy question is how can I display the name of all the available ports eg codeCOM 10, 17. 22, etccode and then show them in my GUI. What I eventually hope to do is have a combo box that can be dynamically populated with the available ports, I have one that switches between a couple ports at the moment but these are fixed ports corresponding to particular computers.p

Negative 369 pLets hope I have worded the question correctly.p  pI have pulled a series of cricketing scorecards and now have x scorecards datasets each containing n rows of observations. What I want to do is create k subsets from the x scorecards by automatically dividing each scorecard dataset by 8. for e.g. one of my scorecards has 168 observations therefore this scorecard will be broken into 21 subsets, while another scorecard contains 128 entries so it will be broken into 16 subsets. p  pI then want to transpose each of the k subsets, this will then give me a dataset containing one row. Finally I want to stack the k transposed datasets to create one big dataset.p  psmall examplep  precodeNT Broom b Henry 21 12 15 3 1 140 JD ryder b Henry 1 3 2 0 0 50.00 codepre  psmall extract from one of the scorecards The above dataset will be divided into 2 subsets, then each of the 2 subsets will by transposed to produce the below 2 datasetsp  ol licodeNT Broom b henry 21  12  15  3   1   140.00codeli licodeJD Ryder b Henry 1 3 2 0 0 50.00codeli ol  pThe two datasets will be stacked on top of eachp  pcodeNT Broom b henry 21 12 15  3   1   140.00code p  pcodeJD Ryder b Henry 1 3 2 0 0 50.00codep  pHope this makes sense.p  pThanks in advance, Ankit p  pwhat Ive done some farp  pemBatting Subset Macroemp  precodeproc sql      select count 8 intototal from compilebatcleanedampmatch  quit   macro createsubsetscount,compilebatcleaned665647     let cnt  sysfuncceilsysevalfampcount8     let num  1      do i  1 to ampcnt         ifampi  ampcnt then do             let toread  ampcount         end         else do             let toread  ampnum  7          end     data compilebatcleaned665647ampi      set compilebatcleaned665647 firstobsampnum obsevalamptoread     run    proc transpose data  compilebatcleaned665647ampi out  compilebatcleaned665647ampi dropname             var batdet2term details4     data compilebatcleaned665647ampi       set compilebatcleaned665647ampi firstobs  2    rename COL1  Batsman           COL2  Dismissal           COL3  RunsScored           COL4  Minutes           COL5  Balls           COL6  Fours           COL7  Sixes           COL8  StrikeRate     let num  evalampnum  8   end  data battersmerged665647   set    do i  1 to ampcnt     compilebatcleaned665647ampi   end    run  mend createsubsets  createsubsetsamptotal,compilebatcleaned665647 codepre  pthe above piece of code works for individual scorecards match665647, but not for a series of scorecard data.

I even tried connecting via a hrefhttp[IP]88http[IP]88a, but still no dice. Skype is uninstalled read that causes problems, IIS was never installed so no World Wide Web Publishing Service and everything says its up, but I cant connect. I even turned off Windows Firewall completely, but still nothing.p  pThe only error log entries are that it seems to be starting up fine minus the SSL config, which I dont care aboutp  precode[Wed May 20 061942.427262 2015] [mpmwinntnotice] [pid 1784tid 596] AH00455 Apache2.4.12 Win32 OpenSSL1.0.1l PHP5.6.8 configured  resuming normal operations [Wed May 20 061942.427262 2015] [mpmwinntnotice] [pid 1784tid 596] AH00456 Apache Lounge VC11 Server built Jan 28 2015 164840 [Wed May 20 061942.427262 2015] [corenotice] [pid 1784tid 596] AH00094 Command line Cdevxamppapachebinhttpd.exe d Cdevxamppapache [Wed May 20 061942.427262 2015] [mpmwinntnotice] [pid 1784tid 596] AH00418 Parent Created child process 2744 [Wed May 20 061942.708511 2015] [sslwarn] [pid 2744tid 500] AH01909 www.example.com4430 server certificate does NOT include an ID which matches the server name [Wed May 20 061942.786636 2015] [sslwarn] [pid 2744tid 500] AH01909 www.example.com4430 server certificate does NOT include an ID which matches the server name [Wed May 20 061942.817887 2015] [mpmwinntnotice] [pid 2744tid 500] AH00354 Child Starting 150 worker threads. codepre  pAccess log is empty, so its like its not even trying to connect.

Negative 369 pI am currently participating in a course for efficient programming of supercomputers and multicore processors. Our recent assignment is to measure the latency for the MPISend command thus the time spent sending a zero byte message. Now this alone would not be that hard, but we have to perform our measurements for the following criteriasp  ul licommunication of processes in the same processor, li lisame node but different processors,  li liand for processes on different nodes.li ul  pI am wondering How do i determine this For proccesses on different nodes i thought about hashing the name returned by MPIGetprocessorname, which returns the identifier of the node the process is currently running on, and sending it as a tag. I also tried using schedcpu to get the core id, but it seems like that this returns a incremental number, even if the cores a hyperthreaded thus a process would run on the same core. How do i go about this  I just need a concept for determining the localities Not a complete code for the stated problem. Thank youp

Negative 369 pIm reading The Standard Library, second edition, by Nicolai Josuttis.

My first impression when I read this was that the author is saying that both programs the one in page 179, see below and the one above should print the name of the cities in the same order on most platforms. But this doesnt happen in clang and GCC. See live examples for a hrefhttpcoliru.stackedcrooked.comae9b9acc88bd62659 relnofollowcodemapcodea and a hrefhttpcoliru.stackedcrooked.comaa320991d7ae7c23f relnofollowcodeunorderedmapcodea in GCC. The same results are obtained in clang.p  pAfter thinking for a while I interpreted the author as saying that the names of the cities are printed in the same order for almost all platforms, when processed with a codeunorderedmapcode, and the output seems to confirm this. But even so, its difficult for me to accept this interpretation, as different implementations will probably use different hash functionsp  pBelow, youll find the example in page 179 referred to abovep  precodeinclude ltmapgt include ltstringgt include ltiostreamgt using namespace std int main      multimapltint,stringgt coll  container for intstring values      insert some elements in arbitrary order       a value with key 1 gets inserted twice     coll   5,tagged,              2,a,              1,this,              4,of,              6,strings,              1,is,              3,multimap       print all element values       element member second is the value     for auto elem  coll          cout ltlt elem.second ltlt            cout ltlt endl  codepre

Negative 369 pCurrently Im working on a defect summary matrix modification that is sorted by Planned Delivery Version and Environment. The pulldownscomboboxes that Im using are FieldValueComboBoxes with the codeeditablecode property set to false so that the user will pick from existing and acceptable Delivery VersionEnvironment filters. I saw that there was a codemultiSelectcode property that allows selecting multiple filters. My question is how can I actually use this to manipulate the filters p  pOriginally I thought that I could retrieve the multiSelected datawhich would be given to me in a string format with each multiSelected item separated in a comma e.g. App Version 1.1,App Version 1.2, split it using split.,, and then assign the individual values into the filter, but I realized I need to filter on the TOTAL of all multiSelected items. For example, right now my solution has my filters updating like App Version 1.1 for one selected item, and then App Version 1.2 separately for the next, effectively meaning that the last selected item will be the only applied filter. I need them to filter like App Version 1.1 AND App Version 1.2 AND ... altogether. I know I can use code.andcode on filters, but how could I apply that to a variable number of values Im taking in Is this even possiblep  pAny and all help would be appreciated, Thanksp

Negative 369 pI am working on a project which involves creating two processes using fork. And the task was to put the child process in background on demand basis. I handled signal handler CTRLZ in parent. And I wrote the code in such a way that when I press CTRLZ, the parent process receives the signal and propagates to child process kill system call passing ctrlz signal number. Though it did not work as expected as I thought, but the major part was done i.e., child process goes into background. Now, I have been told to reverse the process. Ie., on demand basis I should bring back the child process to foreground programatically. Now, as far as I know, when the child process is already suspended, it cannot receive any signal to which it can act upon so that it can make itself a foreground process correct me if I am wrong here. I am stuck how can I achieve this programatically. How to make a process a foreground process on demand basis Any helpp

Negative 369 pBasically, I have a page on an MVC site that allows the user to add rows to a table and modify the data on each row via dropdowns and textboxes. One of the requirements is that if the user refreshes the page, the data is somehow saved and reloaded into the table.p  pNot only is it vital to retain the data on the clientside but refreshing the page will trigger a GET and thus call the Index action of the page. The Index action at the moment assumes that the page is loading for the first time and thus it doesnt care about any existing table data. However, the this page isnt a page that the user can currently access on its own. The user arrives on this page after filling out data on a previous page. That data from said previous page is stored in TempData and passed over to the VM for this page when the Index action is triggered. The serverside problem is that the TempData wont exist when the user refreshes the page. p  pThe solution that I thought of was this.p  pProvide a JavaScript function that triggers via codewindow.bindpageunload, ...code. This function would serialize the table as a JSON object and store it in the local storage with a key. When the page loads, JavaScript will check to see if that key exists in local storage. If so, it will load the table, which should still include all data that it needs to POST back to the server and bind to the Action with its View Model successfully.p  pThere are two question that come from this proposed solutionp  ol liIs this a good solution. If not, what would be best.li liIf 1 is yes, what shall I do on the serverside to let the Index action know that the page is being reloaded and so it shouldnt page any attention to the TempData perhaps just check if TempData is null and return an empty VM if soli ol  pThanks in advance for your answers.p

Negative 369 pId like to test a live shopping cart Magento with real credit card data and to a checkout to ensure checkout works after a code release. p  pHow do I store the credit card data to use in selenium on the live site p  pIm using Nightwatch.js testing framework which runs on Node.js. The test is written in Javascript and can access any HTTP endpoint, TCP or file or do anything Node.js can do. p  pIdeally Id like to either encrypt the credit card data and store it either locally via a service. Then request this data during checkout and just enter the ccv in the command line during the test. p  pOptionally Id like to enter the credit card data at the beginning of the test and secure store this temporarily in memory until all tests are run. p  pId like this to comply with PCI standards. p  pNotes p  pThe tests run in a Node.js process that controls a Selenium Server via Nightwatch.js API. The Selenium server is on a local TCP socket and sends commands to the browser process via the Selenium Webdriver API. p

Negative 369 pI have this problem Ive been working on and cant seem to figure out. At the end of the day I would like to pass some values to a php script from a user form. I am working with files that were written a long time ago and have tried to treat the variable I am trying to pass the same way the original author tried to treat his own. Yet, despite trying to keep the approach the same, I am getting different results. Specifically, in the php script where I want to pass these variables, when I echo the value of POST[whole] I get true or false, yet when I echo the value of POST[plotX] I get a variable undefined error.p  pI apologize for the large amount of code, but I hope that if you search for terms queryDataCenterOfMass and plotX you will see what I am referring to.p  pThe HTML portion comes out as follows. This is where the user selects true or false for whole and true or false for plotX. This is actually code from the webpage, php is used to generate this code, but I thought it would be simpler to paste the HTML.p  precodeltdiv idwholeDiv classdynamicDivgt                                     ltbgtWholeltbgt                                     ltbrgt                                     ltselect idwhole namewhole classatomTypeSelectgt                                         ltoption valuegtampgtampgtSelectampltampltltoptiongt                                         ltoption valuetruegtYesltoptiongt                                         ltoption valuefalse selectedgtNoltoptiongt                                     ltselectgt                                 ltdivgt  ltdiv idplotXDiv classdynamicDivgt                                     ltbgtPlot x dimensionltbgt                                     ltbrgt                                     ltselect idplotX nameplotX classatomTypeSelectgt                                         ltoption valuegtampgtampgtSelectampltampltltoptiongt                                         ltoption valuetruegtYesltoptiongt                                         ltoption valuefalse selectedgtNoltoptiongt                                     ltselectgt                                 ltdivgt codepre  pThe next part is the code that creates the submit button.

Negative 369 pI have a server that successfully generates push notifications and sends them to devices. On the app side, if the user is already in the app or if the user enters the app from the notification I can easily find the notification and run the necessary code to action the notification app delegate gets invoked and the notification is stored in NSUserDefaults which I can then access throughout the app.p  pHowever, if the user has the app running in the background for example, user was in the app, but then switched to another app, when the user reopens the app from the strongapp iconstrong, the app simply returns to the last state it was in and no code actually gets invoked which is kind of what you expect.p  pWhat I am trying to figure out is how to either invoke AppDelegate again so that I can extract the notification strongbeforestrong I return to the current state or how do I invoke  some code so that I can intercept the notification.p  pThoughtsp
Negative 369 pThe below poker hand evaluator is generating a ranking of the different cards the players are holding. It works well in Python 2 but it doesnt work in python 3 because the sort function can no longer compare tuples to integers. How can I make it behave in python 3 the way it used to behave in python 2p  pThe sorting needs to decide which cards are the bestp  precode1, 11, 8, 7, 6, 2  high card 11 rank5 1, 12, 11, 8, 7, 2  high card 12 rank4 3, 2, 11, 12   full house triple and pair rank1 2, 1, 1, 1, 12, 11, 7, 6  pair of 12 rank3 3, 1, 1, 12, 6, 3  three of 12 rank2 codepre  pIf an integer is compared to a tuple, then the first item of the tuple should be relevant.

Negative 369 pI have a meanjs project and I am getting some input from user on server and the request body has the following structure p  precode    transaction          heading ,        items [Object]        ,    something ,    somethingAgain   codepre  pThe structure of the items array is as follows  p  precode[  ref 5607c6536e67edb44a6a8186,     name ,     quantity 0,     discount 0,     cost 180  ] codepre  pwhere the coderefcode is the codeidcode value of the item in my Item model. So, basically what I want to do is loop through the array of items and populate the properties of each ref and compute the codecostcode property accordingly for each item. I cannot use a simple for loop as it would execute itself before even the first async call to mongodb to find the item is completed.  So, how to approach this  Please suggest. p  pSo, adding more information to the question   My server side controller code receiving the request is as follows  p  precodeexports.create  function req, res      console.logreq.body.transaction.items     Sale.createreq.body, function err, sale          if err              return handleErrorres, err                  return res.json201, sale       codepre  pand the log output of the items is as I have shown above. so what I have to do here is iterate over the items array and find the items with coderefcode matching to that of the Items collections.p
Negative 369 pI have started a new domain for a client, and made sure everything works well, however it still has to resolve.  I was Setting nameservers from clients server to our own. p  pBut the client already wanted to send emails. So I have made him a few using DirectAdmin. Although they dont work yet and I get the standard 550 error. And so I was thinking this probably has something to do with either the domain or mail not being resolved yet.p  pSo I was wondering what the standard resolve time is for mailboxes or does this entirly depend on the domainname resolve time I could not find anything via the DA documentation. Any tips or help would be greatly appriciated. p
Negative 369 pI would like to have a query that uses the greater of two valuescolumns if a certain other value for the record is true.p  pIm trying to get a report account holdings. Unfortunately the DB usually stores the value of Cash in a column called codeHoldingQtycode, while for every other type of holding stocks, bonds, mutual funds it stores it in a column called codeQtycode.p  pThe problem is that sometimes the value of the cash is stored in codeQtycode only, and sometimes it is in both codeQtycode and codeHoldingQtycode. Obviously sometimes it is stored only in codeHoldingQtycode as mentioned above.p  pBasically I want my select statement to say if the security is cash, look at both qty and holding qty and give me the value of whatever is greater. Otherwise, if the security isnt cash just give me qty.p  pHow would I write that in TSQL Here is my effortp  precodeSELECT      h.accountname, h.securityname, h.securitytype, h.price,     CASE          WHEN securitytype  cash              THEN WHEN h.qty gt h.holdingqty                       THEN h.qty                    ELSE h.holdingqty          ELSE qty as quantity,       h.totalvalue FROM      holdings h WHERE     ........... codepre
Negative 369 pI, Oracle newbie, am trying to select the primary key ids with a complicated query into an array structure to work with this afterwards. The basic workflow is likep  precode1. Select many ids of type long found by a long and complicated query if I would know if and how this is possible, I would separate this into a functionlike subquery of its own 2. Store the ids in an array like structure 3. Select the rows with those ids 4. Check for duplicates compare certain fields for equality  5. exclude some i.e. duplicates with a later DATE field codepre  pI read a lot of advice on PL  SQL but havent found the right concept. The a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comcdB1050101appdev.920a9662405colls.htm34607 relnofolloworacle documentationa states that if I need an array, I should use VARRAY.  My best approach so far isp  precodedeclare TYPE myids IS VARRAY100000 OF LONG begin SELECT id INTO myids FROM myTable WHERE myconditiontrue  Work with the ids here, i.e. loop through them dbmsoutput.putlineHello World END  codepre  pBut I get an error Not suitable for left side. Additionally, I dont want to declare the size of the array at the top. So I think this approach is wrong. p  pCould anyone show me a better one It doesnt have to be complete code, just use this data structure, these SQLstructures, that loop and youll get what you need. I think I could figure it out once I know which direction I should take.p  pThanks in advancep
