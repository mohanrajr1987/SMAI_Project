Ive got an Xcode project that purportedly builds the library libcrypto.a and libssl.a are successfully created, but when compiling the older program, I get the error p  pno OpenSSL thread supportp  pThis is caused by a preprocessor check throwing the errorp  precode...      define OPENSSLTHREADDEFINES     include ltopensslopensslconf.hgt      ifndef OPENSSLTHREADS     error no OpenSSL thread support     endif  ... codepre  pThe opensslconf.h file is being found, but apparently OPENSSLTHREADS is not being defined it it. Is this supposed to be included somewhere in that file Is it some sort of configuration error on my part when building the OpenSSL libraryp  pAny help with this is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advancep

Positive 1999 pI am Creating a ssl server using openssl. In that I am using SSLCTXsetverify method to specify that I need to verify a requested client certificate . I read that if its last argument  which is Verifycallback function pointer  is passed as null , it picks up the default Verifycallback . I want to know how it verifies the client certificatep  pI have already installed the CA certificate using a hrefhttpaskubuntu.comquestions73287howdoiinstallarootcertificatehttpaskubuntu.comquestions73287howdoiinstallarootcertificatea and I see the certificate which client is passing is present at  etcsslcerts location in server . If I manually specify this cert using SSLCTXloadverifylocations in server , Client Cert validation passes . I dont want to hardcode any cert like this. So relying on the default locations it must be looking for the certs in server to verify.p  pHow will this be possible Is my understanding correct in this regardp

Positive 1999 pIm trying to learn how to write a clientserver application to transfer files to and from a server using SSL.  Ive mostly figured out the client side using cURL andor OpenSSL in C, but Im stumped on the server side...  I have experience using Perl and other cgibin type scripts but I havent been able to find any tutorials on how to actually receive the data on the server side, only about the certificates and the authentication. Any help would be most appreciatedp
Positive 1999 pI need to implement TLS on an embedded device with an OpenSSL client running on a normal computer.  The data transfers are limited to less than 1 kB at a time.  I have been looking at mbedtls and it is possible to limit the record buffer to 2 kB to save memory, however the standard TLS record can be up to 16 kB.  Is it possible to limit the record size in TLS or at the very least require each SSLwrite command to create its own record  Otherwise OpenSSL may concatenate the data and create a record that is too long to be received. I have complete control over both ends of the connection so there shouldnt be any issues with compatibility. p

Negative 1999 pWe recently had a problem where, after a series of commits had occurred, a backend process failed to run. Now, we were good little boys and girls and ran coderake testcode after every checkin but, due to some oddities in Rails library loading, it only occurred when we ran it directly from Mongrel in production mode.p  pI tracked the bug down and it was due to a new Rails gem overwriting a method in the String class in a way that broke one narrow use in the runtime Rails code.p  pAnyway, long story short, is there a way, at runtime, to ask Ruby where a method has been defined Something like codewhereami foo code that returns codepathtosomefile.rb line 45code In this case, telling me that it was defined in class String would be unhelpful, because it was overloaded by some library. p  pI cannot guarantee the source lives in my project, so grepping for codedef foocode wont necessarily give me what I need, not to mention if I have emmanyem codedef foocodes, sometimes I dont know until runtime which one I may be using.p

GHC Haskell also has a hrefhttpresearch.microsoft.com7Esimonpjpapersstmbeautiful.pdfan extremely elegant STM monada which also allows transaction composition.

Negative 1999 pI am trying to call DeviceIoControl from C for codeIOCTLDVDcode control codes.  Having read a lot of information and trying a number of examples I have not made much progress.p  pWhat I am trying to eventually do is get a codeDVDLAYERDESCRIPTORcode structure about the media currently in the DVD drive.  I can call codeCreateFilecode successfully on the DVD device, but when I try to call codeDeviceIoControlcode with the control code codeIOCTLDVDSTARTSESSIONcode it returns a success code but I dont seem to get the sessionId value back successfully, always returns 0.  And any attempt I have then made to try getting the layer description with codeIOCTLDVDREADSTRUCTUREcode fails, i.e. function fails or returns success but gives a blank output structure.p  pAfter finding some C code which makes similar calls I was able to compile this code using Visual C 2008 Express Edition and it successfully is able to start a session, read the codeDVDLAYERDESCRIPTORcode, and close the session without problem so I know this works.p  pThe C issues appear to relate to how the external function is defined and the parameters marshalled.  And how the various structures that are passed and returned are defined.  p  pI have looked at www.pinvoke.net for how they define it, and have used some of the example code and definitions given but still have the same issues as outlined above.  Part of the problem seems to be that for each IOCTL control code the parameters are different, mostly structs, but for codeIOCTLDVDSTARTSESSIONcode the output value is a 32 bit integer.  How can an extern method in C be defined to handle these different cases  Also various structs, defined with the right sized member types, show they are different sizes between the C and C code, but the individual members are the same sizesp  pIf I use a program like codeDeviceIOViewcode and watch the calls made by both the C code and C code for codeIOCTLDVDSTARTSESSIONcode the C version returns a sessionid of 3 and DeviceIOView shows the data being sent back when running the C code is also 3 so there seems to be some sort of Marshalling issue of the returned parameters as we only see 0 in the C codep  pDoes anyone have any ideas or working example code on how to call DeviceIoControl from C to access DVD information  Showing how the structures and function should be defined and used.

Negative 1999 pI have two collections  an ArrayList and a Stack.  I use the stack because I needed some simple poppush functionality for this bit of code. The ArrayList is essentially the out variable as this is a small section of code in the function.p  pSo, the variables are defined as such, then code is run to add elements to the stack.p  precodeArrayListltStringgt out  new ArrayListltStringgt   other code..   StackltStringgt lineStack  new StackltStringgt   code that adds stuff to the stack  codepre  pThe question is, now that I have a fully populated stack, how do I place it in the out ArrayList in a reverse order then from the pop order.p  pMy first thought up solution was p  precode whilelineStack.empty       out.add0, lineStack.pop   codepre  p... which works, but I worry about the efficiency of adding an element to the beginning of the ArrayList which forces all existing elements to need to shift.. its a linked list I believe.. big deal.. but still a concern. Also, I am running this through a loop... perhaps unnecessarily. p  pSo, my second solution that didnt involve looping at least in my code, im sure the back end calls are doing it.p  precode List l  lineStack.subList0, lineStack.size  out.addAlll codepre  pI know I dont need to allocate the list, but itll keep for cleaner code. However, I am not sure if this will give me a particularly helpful performance gain.p  pSo, my question is  Which of these will likely be most efficient for SMALL to MEDIUM size sets If there is a more efficient solution, what would it bep

Negative 1999 pOur application has many controls that are created dynamically.  For example, a navigation pane contains groups of links that change as the user navigates through the app.  The first time I use AccExplorer to select these links, it finds them perfectly.  However, after I navigate to another page, AccExplorer cant see the links in the updated navigation pane.  In fact, the old link controls still appear in the AccExplorer tree hierarchy and as I click on them AccExplorer highlights areas of the desktop that are outside the bounds of our applications actual window.p  pThe controls have changed, but AccExplorer doesnt recognize them.  It still thinks the hierarchy is the same.p  pWhat I find strange is that closing AccExplorer and then opening a new instance of AccExplorer results in the same results.  When I select the new navigation control with AccExplorer, it doesnt see the new links.  It recreates the old hierarchy with the old links.  The only way to see the new links is if I close our application, reopen our application, manually navigate to the new page, then select the controls with AccExplorer.p  pThe navigation control is a DevExpress control.  OS is WinXP.  AccExplorer 2.0.  Id prefer to use UIAutomation, but not all DevExpress controls support UIAutomation.  Were trying to use MSAA to fill in those gaps.p

Negative 1999 pIn your opinion, who should fix a bug  A programmer, right  OK but really, who...  let me explain.p  pIm a Scrum Master across a number of Scrum projects.  Scrum says ringfence your resources where possible, a sentiment I wholeheartedly agree with.  p  pGenerally we integrate a certain age of each sprint to be bugfixing from the previous sprints  all well and good.p  pAfter each Sprint we Demo and Restrospective to our clients, and promote our development code to a UAT environment our client generally doesnt want a small bit of his project to golive, but thats up to them  were keeping our side of the bargain by ensuring we deploy working and testable code.  p  pOnce all sprints are complete we have a UAT phase where the client takes a thorough test of the completed software to find any last minute bugs.  Now ideally these would have been caught already, but realistically there are a some that only discovered during UAT.p  pDuring this UAT phase, not all the developers are needed on the project 100 of the time, and so we like to reallocate them to other projects.  However, Scrum says ringfence your resources where possible.  p  pMy problem is, Im allocating developers to the UAT phase of one project while starting a separate Scrum project with them elsewhere.  Not ideal  however, this is a commercial reality at the moment.p  pI can eitherp  p1 Live with it and have developers fix their own code  and allocate some time say, 20 of the developer to the previous projects UAT.  p  p2 Ensure a handover is in place and have 1 or 2 developers dedicated to bug fixing code 100 of the time.p  pI like 1, but it makes resourcing a real pain in the arse.  p  p2 scares me, I feel developers wont take responsibility over the quality of their own code.  I feel theres a lot to be said in ensuring developers take ownership of their own code  and asking them to fix their own bugs is a good way of ensuring quality.  Noone likes fixing bugs, so Ive found developers generally try and do a better job up front knowing theyll have to fix any issues that are raised anyway.  However, 2 is easier to plan and resource.  But 2 will take longer, as fixing a bug in someone elses code is costly in terms of time and resource.  If it is a complicated fix, it may need the original developers help anyway, and it will certainly take longer to fix by someone who isnt as familiar with that section of the code base.p  pWhat do people thinkp

I need to check against the database until i get a unique one. That all seems like too much nop  pAm I looking at this wrong way Or are there ready APIs and tools to make this easier and more efficientp  pIm using PHP  MySQL, Apache.p  pThanksp

Negative 1999 pOne of the most important issues in using factor analysis is its interpretation. Factor analysis often uses factor rotation to enhance its interpretation. After a satisfactory rotation, the rotated factor loading matrix strongLstrong will have the same ability to represent the correlation matrix and it can be used as the factor loading matrix, instead of the unrotated matrix strongLstrong.p  pThe purpose of rotation is to make the rotated factor loading matrix have some desirable properties. One of the methods used is to rotate the factor loading matrix such that the rotated matrix will have a strongsimple structurestrong.p  pL. L. Thurstone introduced the Principle of Simple Structure, as a general guide for factor rotationp  h2Simple Structure Criteriah2  ol liEach row of the factor matrix should contain at least one zeroli liIf there are m common factors, each column of the factor matrix should have at least m zerosli liFor every pair of columns in the factor matrix, there should be several variables for which entries approach zero in the one column but not in the otherli liFor every pair of columns in the factor matrix, a large proportion of the variables should have entries approaching zero in both columns when there are four or more factorsli liFor every pair of columns in the factor matrix, there should be only a small number of variables with nonzero entries in both columnsli ol  pThe ideal simple structure is such thatp  ol lieach item has a high, or meaningful, loading on one factor only andli lieach factor have high, or meaningful, loadings for only some of the items.li ol  pThe problem is that, trying several combinations of rotation methods along with the parameters that each one accepts especially for oblique ones, the number of candidate matrices increases and it is very difficult to see which one better meets the above criteria.p  pWhen I first faced that problem I realized that I was unable to select the best match by merely looking at them, and that I needed an algorithm to help me decide. Under the stress of projects deadlines, the most I could do was to write the following code in MATLAB, which accepts one rotation matrix at a time and returns under some assumptions whether each criterion is met or not. A new version If I would ever tried to upgrade it would accept a 3d matrix a set of 2d matrices as an argument, and the algorithm should return the one that better fits the above criteria.p  pI am just asking for your opinions I also think that theres been criticism over the usefulness of the method by itself and perhaps better approaches to the rotation matrix selection problem. If someone wants to provide some code, I would prefer R or MATLAB. p  pP.S.

Negative 1999 pI have setup a basic WCF clientserver which are communicating via Named pipes.p  pIt is a duplex contract with a callback.

Negative 1999 pWe are creating a large ecommerce database that needs to allow for data in multiple languages. For example, the product table will need one or more translations for Name, Description, MetaTitle, MetaKeywords, MetaDescription and so on.p  pThere are several ways to accomplish this from a relational database design standpoint. But Entity Framework 4 adds a few constraints and performance is a big concern.p  pSimilar issue as in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2227985whatsthebestdatabasestructuretokeepmultilingualdataMultilingual Database Designap  pHere is an example set of tables we are consideringp  precode[Product]  Id PK  CreateDate  NamePhraseId FK  DescriptionPhraseId FK  Price  ...  [Phrase]  id PK  Invariant  [Translation]  id PK  PhraseId FK  LanguageCulture Example enUS  Translation codepre  pWe could also add a LanguageCulture lookup table.p  pThis method has its pros and cons like other methods. We dont want to have to create additional tables for each table column that may require translation no ProductName, ProductDescription tables for instance as that would make our data model too large.p  pIn the example above, a Product Name will have zero or one Phrases with one or more translations. As I recall, Entity Framework requires 1 to 1 relationships to have the same primary key on the tables, I dont know if thats the same case with 0 or 1 relationships but that may be a dealbreaker for the method above.p  pIve had a really hard time finding good information about Entity Framework and Multilingual databasemodel design guidance. I would greatly appreaciate advice and guidance with emphasis on good design and the best possible performance.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 1999 pI work on a legacy system that has a VB6 app that needs to call Java code.  The solution we use is to have the VB app call a C dll that uses JNI to call the Java code.  A bit funky, but its actually worked pretty well.  However, Im moving to a new dev box, and Ive just run into a serious problem with this.  The built VB app works fine on the new box, but when I try to run it from VB, the dll fails to load the VM, getting a return code of 4 JNIENOMEM from JNICreateJavaVM.  p  pBoth the built app and VB are calling the exact same dll, and Ive tried it with both Java 1.5 and 1.6.  Ive tried the suggestions a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions798876howdoigetanerrormessagewhenfailingtoloadajvmviajniherea redirecting stdout and stderr to files, adding a vfprint option, adding an Xcheckjni option, but to no avail.  I cant seem to get any additional information out of the jvm.  As far as I can tell, the new box is configured pretty much the same as the old one installed software, Path, Classpath, etc., and both are running the same release of Windows Server 2003.  The new machine is an x64 box with more memory 4GB rather than 2GB, but its running 32bit Windows.  p  pAny suggestions or ideas about what else to look into  Rewriting the whole thing in a more sane way is not an option  I need to find a way to have the dll get the jvm to load without thinking that its out of memory.

Negative 1999 pIm trying to insert some data from a XML document into a variable table.

Negative 1999 pHi so this is my situation up to now.

But what I really want to do it to have the needle constantly rotating itself to the correct angle based off a constantly changing value.p  pFor example if I have a decibel value that gives me the current decibel level in the room, Id like that needle to reflect that value i.e. 10  10dB, and since this value is constantly changing Id want my needle to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise accordingly.p  pDoes anyone know how I could do that Id also appreciate it if someone could post some source code to help me out.p

Negative 1999 pSo, I made a simple java RMI application in Eclipse using the genady plugin. It works fine in this environment but it would be nice if it could be run outside Eclipse too.p  pIn Eclipse to run it I first start the RMI registry. Then I enable stubs creation for the server. Then I run the server as an RMI application, also I let Eclipse automatically generate the codebase parameter. Finally I run the client also as a RMI application, adding the parameter security policy just let eclipse create one for me.p  pSo it is pretty simple really.p  pMy project structure is the following I have 3 separate java projectsp  p1 rmi commonp  p2 rmi serverp  p3 rmi clientp  pBoth the server and client depend on the common project have it on their build path.p  pIn the common project I have the remote interface description basically the methods the client can call from server and also a class, which is used as a parameter for one of the interface methods.p  pThe server is quite simple really.. extends UnicastRemoteObject and implements the interface. Just gets the registry and binds itself.p  pThe client is also not very complicated. Sets a security manager new RMI security manager and looks up the server. Also it has a user interface class but that is not so important.p  pSo I am wondering how to create executable jars from the client and server. Ideally I would like to start up the registry from the command line, then start the server from the CL and finally also the client the same way.p  pFor some reason eclipse wont let me generate an executable jar for these projects even though they both have a main method. I have tried creating a regular jar but it does not work because it does not find the main class.p  pI would really appreciate if someone could tell me how to export this project from eclipse so that it could be run from the command line.p

Negative 1999 pI read and reread the relevant clauses about ODR in the C standard, but this question still remains open to me.

It says the token sequence must be the same. Does it include the local identifier names p  pIn other words strongemdoes the following  program violate the ODRemstrong I tried to test it myself with Visual Studio 2008 and got 0 errors and 0 warnings.

Negative 1999 pI created a class extending Thread to retrieve user location through LocationManager in a nonui thread. I implemented this as a tread because it has to be started on request and do its work just for a limited time.

Now if I use self.SetSizermainGrid instead of SetSizerAndFit, the components I added in the above code are not positioned properly UNTIL I resize my frame manually. With SetSizerAndFit this works. But now I want my gl canvas to resize with my frame. So my approach isp  precodedef OnSizingself, event     size  self.GetSize            newCanvasXSize  size.GetWidth  MINBUTSIZE     newCanvasYSize  size.GetHeight  40     self.canvas.SetSizenewCanvasXSize, newCanvasYSize     self.Layout codepre  pHowever this doesnt work and my canvas stays the same size as before. Ive read somewhere that SetSizerAndFit also sets the minsize and that is why resizing doesnt work with it. However, even if I leave it with SetSizer, and resize the frame so everything is positioned properly, the resizing of the canvas doesnt work. Deleting and creating the GLCanvas is not and option here since it takes quite some time to load my vertices.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOk using SetSizer  Layout gets the positioning done.

If I go for a pure SetSizer  Layout approach this is what happens. The components  my GLCanvas and 3 other buttons are added to the frame in their corresponding locations. However 1.The frame is not resized to the needed size so my buttons are somewhere outside the frame. 2.The GLCanvas is positioned but it doesnt display anything UNTIL I do a resize event myself.p  p3.Maybe not dirrectly connected but it is possible to decrease min size Im asking because if I use SetMinSize in the Resize handler on the canvas it resizes ONLY WHEN the size increases. If frame size decreases the canvas remains with the oldlarger min size.p  pstrongEDIT3strongp  pOk after some tweaking I managed to get my canvas to resize with the frame.

Negative 1999 pI have recently experienced a new problem using RAD 8.0.2. When I launch a WAS server from within RAD, with or without any apps published to it, WAS will start and will show output in the console. I can even access the server from my web browser. However, RAD never recognizes that WAS has started successfully and after the timeout limit is reached, RAD claims that the server failed to start. I have tried this with WAS 6.1 and 7.0 test environments and WebSphere Portal 6.1 external environment and I always get the same result. Naturally, this makes development extremely difficult and I am anxious to get this fixed. Any help would be greatly appreciated  Johnp

This seems to work, but I stumble on the same problem as APNDroid has since we cant detect when the app is removed, all the suffixes will remain if the user first turns off 3G with the app and then uninstalls the app.p  pThis is an ugly and dangerous solution, because the end user may be left with all APNs broken.p  pIts possible to detect uninstallation from another application, but how would one force the user to install another application to just monitor the first one It seems there is no way from 2.3 on to write a 3Gmanaging app.p  pAny ideas Thank youp

Negative 1999 pIm trying to make the same Tornado serve requests to two different Django WSGI applications. In the Tornado server i have code which, based on hostnamedomain creates the correct WSGI application.p  pI do not know the hostnames up front, so a static config file will not work, it has to be handled inside the webserver, when the request it processed. That is why a Load Balancing server like Pound will not fit the purpose.p  pThe main problem is that the first instance of the WSGI application created inside Tornado remains in scope and further requests are always handled the this instance, even though i try to use another instance.p  pI think it has to do with Djangos settings module. It only loads settings from the first WSGI application, and does not seem to initialise again when the second WSGI application is loaded.p  pSo I guess the question is how i force Django to use the correct settings file in a given request. Or reload it. How is this accomplishedp  pAlternative make it on unified Django application and move the hostdomain logic to fx. a middleware class.p

So i made a direct copy of the project for customer1 to another folder for customer 2. p  pThis project is hosted in a hrefhttpproject.example.comcustomer2 relnofollowhttpproject.example.comcustomer2ap  pNow when i try and run the project for customer2 calling a single page, i get the error messagep  precodeFatal error Cannot redeclare class SmsService in varwwwhtmlprojectcustomer1applicationservice.class.php on line 3  codepre  pHere, service.class.php is a simple interface with 3 methodsp  precodeinterface SmsService      public function SendSmsmobile, customerId, customerName, message     public function QueryIncomingResponse     public function CleanExpiredConfirmationsmaxConfirmationDays  codepre  pprinting the backtrace in service.class.php reveals something interrestingp  precode0 requireonce called at [varwwwhtmlprojectcustomer2endpointqueryIncomingResponse.php2]  Fatal error Cannot redeclare class SmsService in varwwwhtmlprojectcustomer1applicationservice.class.php on line 3 codepre  pLine 2 in queryIncomingResponses is the very first require line there is. Line 3 in service.class.php is the first statement there is in the file Line 2 is an empty line and line 1 is the php file opening tag.p  pNaturally, I only work with relative requires double checked this so there is no way one includerequire from customer2 actually refers to a file for customer1.p  pIt seems to me that in some way SmsService and other classes gets cached by PHP. I have little control over the server environment. One solution to this would be namespaces. Unfortunatly, we work with PHP 5.1.7 where namespaces are not a part of the language feature just yet. Another way would be to mimic namespaces by prefixing all classes but this approach just feels dirty.p  pDoes anyone have more information on this problem and possibly solutions Many thanks in advancep

Negative 1999 pHeres my interpretation of how Dijkstras algorithm a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDijkstra27salgorithm relnofollowas described by wikipediaa would deal with the below graph.p  pFirst it marks the shortest distance to all neighbouring nodes, so A gets 1 and C gets 7. Then it picks the neighbour with the current shortest path. This is A. The origin is marked as visited and will not be considered again. The shortest and only path from the origin to B through A is now 12. A is marked as visited. The shortest path from the origin to the Destination through B is 13. B is marked as visited. The shortest path from the Origin to C through the destination is 14, but this is double the previous shortest path to C, which is 7, so the 14 is discarded. The destination is now marked as visited. p  pDestination has been marked visited, therefore the alogorithm is complete. Heres the resultp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comd8EMo.jpg altSupposedly failing case for Dijkstrap  pSo am I misinterpretting the description Is the description on wikipedia wrong Or have I somehow stumbled upon a case that shows Dijkstras algorithm is incorrect which I highly doubt Ive noticed that the path chosen seems to be picked in a greedy manner, but apparently this is one of the defining characteristics of the algorithm, however in this case it seems to give the wrong result.p

Negative 1999 pIm looking for some highlevel recommendations for how to implement a project Im starting for a client.p  pThis is a web page that will include an SVG canvas sized 920px W x 450px H containing 2040 circular images i.e., they may just be square images cropped with a circle. The size of the images will probably range from about 50px to about 200px diameter, each one set dynamically within that range based on data from an API. Its basically a dynamic data visualization, so pretty much every aspect of this needs to be configurabledynamic.p  pI think the hardest problem to solve is how to distribute these images within the given canvas area, considering that they will vary in size, and should appear to be evenlyrandomly distributed i.e., they shouldnt line up to a grid, be clumped together, or be in groups of similar sizes. Its OK if they overlap slightly.

Its a simple thing which sends recorded data at a certain rate over the internet.  It has a slider bar which shows what timestep the data is at, and if you drag it it lets you set the time to a certain point.  It has radio buttons to set the rate multiplier 1x, 10x, 25x.  p  pAnyway, it looks like they discontinued Mozilla Prism and Id like to move away from using XUL.  Ive found info on windows forms and also wxwidgets.  I dont care if it only runs on Windows.  Whats the simplest to implement way to get a basic GUI working with radio buttons and slider barsp
Negative 1999 pI have a custom subclass of a UITableViewController which has a editable cells in the table.  I use the UITableViewController because I get all the nice code that moves the cells to be visible when the keyboard appears for free.p  pFor one of my cell types I have a UIPicker that appears in place of the keyboard.  All works well and I have a nice animation to slide it in and out just like the keyboard.  The problem is, because I added the picker as a subview the UITableViewControllers view property it is possible for the user to scroll the UIPicker up and down.p  pI understand why this is happening I assume the view property is assigned to the tableView property of the viewController and therefore my picker is being added on top of the tableView, which has a scroll view as its parent.  What I am not sure is the bestrecommendend way around this.p  pI tried adding the picker to the superView of the UIViewControllers view but no dicep  precode[myViewController.view.superView addSubViewmyPicker] codepre  pI still want to keep all the nice keyboard effects but would like my picker to behave like the keyboard, slide up and stay fixed in position and then slide away when done.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p  pDavep
Negative 1999 pI have an app that connects to a remote chat server and then the user is able to chat. I have a form where the user enters hostname and port and then another form where the user sees all messages and types new ones.p  pFor the networking, it seems, I have no other choice but to use an AsyncTask. But there is something that I dont know how to do. I would start the networking in the UI when onCreate is called which is not a problem. But then when I have to wire the networking and the interface it becomes a mess. I have created two asynchronous tasks  one for sending and one for receiving but yet it doesnt work for me.

Negative 1999 pI have a standard HTML login page, which I would much rather use than the standard HTTP authentication popup provided by browsers.  Today, I am using session cookies to keep track of the session after logging in, but Id like to be stateless and pass the HTTP authentication every time.  The web services I am hitting already support this, so this is a browseronly issue.p  pAdding authentication credentials is trivial in jQuery, but I dont know how to keep them around.  If you go from the login page a jsp to the Home page another jsp you clearly dont keep the username and password fields from the login page.  I know some browsers will store your HTTP authentication credentials if you enter them from the popup, but I dont know if they get stored when using an XHRRequest.  If they do, is there much consistency among browsersp  pAlso, the user needs to be able to sign out of the application, too.  If the browser stores the authentication credentials, is there a way to clear them using JavaScript.p  pI feel like I cant be the first person to try to solve this.  Is there some jQuery plugin or something that already handles this Or is it simply not possible to do what Im trying to dop

Negative 1999 pWhen I draw a path with MKOverlays sometimes with 5000 individual MKPolylines, there is a very long wait for all of the overlays to be drawn, and every time the map view is scrolled to a new area, the overlays for that area have to be drawn, and there is another noticeable freezeup. p  pMy dilemma is that I have two sets of code which both draw the path correctly.

Negative 1999 pI am trying to obfuscate a bundle with proguard. Because of project specific reasons, my bundles have library jars in them, such asp  precodebundle.jar        METAINF        library.jar        org and the rest of my source tree codepre  pThe Manifest.mf file in METAINF includes the linep  precodeBundleClassPath .,library.jar codepre  pAnd this is all autogenerated and good.p  pNow, the problem comes when proguard tries to obfuscate methods from library.jar lets say I have a good reason to do that. In those cases, it wont find library.jar since its not part of the dependent libraries, and proguard seemingly ignores the BundleClasspath entry in the manifest file.p  pSo, the question is can that be done at all Or is proguard completely osgi agnostic and cant handle those tags at all Is there a way I can provide an injar dependency to proguardp  pThanksp

Negative 1999 pI am using a custom controller for transitions could not use navigation controller due to inherent cycles in project, which would allow the navigation controllers stack to grow unbounded [which I assume would cause memory issues]. I am emulating a navigation controllers sliding animation when transitioning to new screens using UIView animateWithDurationanimationscompletionp  pWhen a button triggering the transition is pressed, the frame of the new view I want to transition to is set to an offscreen position. In the animation for the transition UIView animateWithDurationanimationscompletion, the view currently on screen has its frame set to an offscreen position, and the new view is set to an onscreen position.p  pThis is inside my custom controller for transitionsp  precodeCGFloat windowWidth  self.mainView.frame.size.width CGFloat windowHeight  self.mainView.frame.size.height CGRect offScreenLeft  CGRectMake1windowWidth, 0.0, windowWidth, windowHeight CGRect onScreen  self.mainView.frame CGRect offScreenRight   CGRectMakewindowWidth, 0.0, windowWidth, windowHeight   if direction  TransitionDirectionForward      if dragBackgroundOnscreen         [self.mainView addSubviewself.backgroundView]         [self.mainView sendSubviewToBackself.backgroundView]         self.backgroundView.frame  offScreenRight             self.currentViewController.view.frame  offScreenRight      [UIView animateWithDuration0.65                      animations                          oldViewController.view.frame  offScreenLeft                          if dragBackgroundOffscreen                              self.backgroundView.frame  offScreenLeft                          else if dragBackgroundOnscreen                              self.backgroundView.frame  onScreen                           self.currentViewController.view.frame  onScreen                                            completionBOOL finished                          [oldViewController.view removeFromSuperview]                            if dragBackgroundOffscreen                              [self.backgroundView removeFromSuperview]                          [oldViewController willMoveToParentViewControllernil]                          [oldViewController removeFromParentViewController]                          [self.currentViewController didMoveToParentViewControllerself]                       ]    else if direction  TransitionDirectionBackward      if dragBackgroundOnscreen         [self.mainView addSubviewself.backgroundView]         [self.mainView sendSubviewToBackself.backgroundView]         self.backgroundView.frame  offScreenLeft           self.currentViewController.view.frame  offScreenLeft     [UIView animateWithDuration0.65                       animations                          oldViewController.view.frame  offScreenRight                           if dragBackgroundOffscreen                              self.backgroundView.frame  offScreenRight                          else if dragBackgroundOnscreen                              self.backgroundView.frame  onScreen                           self.currentViewController.view.frame  onScreen                                            completionBOOL finished                          [oldViewController.view removeFromSuperview]                           if dragBackgroundOffscreen                              [self.backgroundView removeFromSuperview]                          [oldViewController willMoveToParentViewControllernil]                          [oldViewController removeFromParentViewController]                          [self.currentViewController didMoveToParentViewControllerself]                      ]    codepre  pI also want the background self.backgroundView to remain static unless moving to a screen that has its own background i.e. I dont want the background to slide if the new views background is the same background.p  pI am using TransitionDirectionBackward and TransitionDirectionForward just to differentiate between sliding left and sliding right.p  pEverything works great, except when transitioning involves a GMGridView. the problem when the Gridviews frame is set to an offscreen frame its really setting its currently selected pages frame to that offscreen frame. Other pages of the gridview are not bounded by this frame, so they can appear on screen even before the transition. I tried setting the frame and bounds property on the GridViews viewcontrollers view, but I can still get a page of the gridview appearing onscreen before the transition animation. p  pAnyone see a solution to this I was trying to find a way to clip the view of the GridView during the transition so pages dont appear except for the currently selected page, but havent found anything useful.p  pUPDATE I found a possible fix by setting alpha  0.0 for cells that are visible but shouldnt be later setting alpha  1.0 when the transition animation is complete. However, I need to know which cells to do this for. I need a way to access the page that the GMGridView is currently on so I can set the adjacent pages cells to have an alpha of 0.0.p  pUPDATE Found a way to get it to work by using myGridView convertPointA cgpoint i found by trial and error to be on the first cell of a page. fromViewmyGridView.window. NOTE I needed an ifelse if to check if i was in lanscape left or landscape right since the window coordinates do not rotate when the device is rotated. with this i was able to get the index of the cell at the point on the screen i had specified and then set the previous page to be transparent until after the transition animation.p  pI would still like to know if there is a way of clipping the gridview so that if the cells could be opaque, but just never displayed....p

Negative 1999 pem[I hope this is appropriate for SO, I thought it was a bit too practical for programmers and too technical for gamedev but feel free to move if it doesnt fit.]emp  pBasically I just wanted a quick check on my actual design for a micro video engine that should simply be able to draw images rendering library is irrelevant and animated sprites. I am having a hard time wrapping my head around a good design for this task though as I think rendering should be done by my VideoEngine class hence not in Image but this leads me to be forced to use codefriendcode and codeexterncode which is not good design as I hear. This may be because I have not coded this properly but I think its more of a design question.p  precode Sprite.h class Image  public     Image     Imagestdstring path     Image      bool IsDisplayable  return displayed      void LoadImagestdstring path      static stdvectorltImagegt imagelist private     SDLSurface    imagesurface     bool            displayed      friend class    VideoEngine    VideoEngine.h extern class Image  class VideoEngine  public     VideoEngine     VideoEngineint width, int height      VideoEngine      void Initializeint width, int height     void RenderImages     void ShutdownVE private     SDLSurface    maindisplay     SDLRect        maindisplayarea    VideoEngine.cpp void VideoEngineRenderImages      stdvectorltImagegtconstiterator ci     forci  Imageimagelist.cbegin ci  Imageimagelist.cend ci              ifci  0 ampamp cigtIsDisplayable                      SDLBlitSurfacecigtimagesurface, 0, maindisplay, 0             SDLFlipmaindisplay                codepre  pAs you see, the fact that I need to access codeimagesurfacecode inside the codeImagecode from the codeVideoEnginecode class forces me to use codefriendcode and codeexterncode and doing the other way around Image having the rendering function would just force me to use the exact opposite VideoEngine being friend with Image, which I think is ugly.p  pstrongTLDRstrong Is this kind of doublerelationship solvable by any clean way  One thing I think could be doable but would incur more checking on resources is notifying VideoEngine in some way each time an image is created and pass it the SDLSurface pointer to store in a list. Would this be better design p

Negative 1999 pI need to capture video clips during automated tests wich runs over 12 hours. My problem is that the movies get too big and i only want small movie clips if an error occurs. So my idea was to write  c tool   which buffers only some e.g. 3 minutes of a movie and throws away the captured frames before the 3 minutes to find out what the reason of the error is. If an error occures i want to save the 3 minute before the error occurs.  It would be nice if this happens in a compressed way.  The recoding session continues and if the next error occures i want to save the next 3 minute clip and so on. That means i have to capture a stream and make sure that only the last x minutes will be captured to find out where the error comes from. What also is important that dual monitors is supported when a vidoe is captured. It should be possible to set the framerate. The Trigger will be done via C code.p  pWhat is the best way to do it How can I achieve this with cp  pBernhardp

Negative 1999 pI asked a question a couple of days ago about stripping HTML from files with PERL.  I am a n00b and Ive searched the site for answers to my question...but unfortunately I couldnt find anything...this is probably because Im a n00b and I didnt see the answer when I was looking at it.p  pSo, here is the situation.  I have a directory with around 20 gb of text files.  I want to strip the HTML from each file and output each file to a unique text file.  Ive written the program below, which seems to do the trick for the first 12 text files in the directory there are about 12,000 text files in total...however...I run into a couple of snags. The first snag is that after the 12th text file has been parsed, then I start getting warnings about deep recursion...and then shortly after this the program quits because Ive run out of memory.  I imagine that my programming is extremely inefficient.  So, Im wondering if any of you see any obvious errors with my code below that would case me to run out of memory.  ...once I figure things out then hopefully Ill be able to contribute.p  precodeusrbinperl w use strict use Benchmark get the HTMLFormat package from the package manager. use HTMLFormatter get the HTMLTREE from the package manager use HTMLTreeBuilder use HTMLFormatText startTime  new Benchmark my directCDirectory my slash  opendirDIR1,directdie Cant open directory my New1readdirDIR1  foreach fileNew1   if file.next Initialize the variable names. my HTML0 my treeEmpty my data Open the file and put the file in variable called data       local      open SLURP, directslash.file or die cant open file       read the contents into data     data  ltSLURPgt       close the filehandle called SLURP     close SLURP or die cannot close file      ifdatamltHTMLgtiHTML1     ifHTML1                      the following steps strip out any HTML tags, etc.             treeHTMLTreeBuildergtnewgtparsedata             formatterHTMLFormatTextgtnewleftmargingt 0, rightmargingt60             Alldataformattergtformattree            print my outfile  out.file open FOUT, gt directoutfile print FOUT file filenHTML HTMLnAlldatan, x 40, n  closeFOUT     endTime  new Benchmark runTime  timediffendTime, startTime print Processing files took , timestrrunTime codepre

Negative 1999 pI am using Nonnegative Matrix Factorization and Nonnegative Least Squares for predictions, and I want to evaluate how good the predictions are depending on the amount of data given. For example the original Data wasp  precodeoriginal  [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0] codepre  pAnd now I want to see how good I can reconstruct the original data when the given data is incompletep  precodeincomplete1  [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0], incomplete2  [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], incomplete3  [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] codepre  pAnd I want to do this for every example in a big dataset. Now the problem is, the original data varies in the amount of positive data, in the original above there are 4, but for other examples in the dataset it could be more or less. Lets say I make an evaluation round with 4 positives given, but half of my dataset only has 4 positives, the other half has 5,6 or 7. Should I exclude the half with 4 positives, because they have no data missing which makes the prediction much better On the other side I would change the trainingset if I excluded data. What can I do Or shouldnt I evaluate with 4 at all in this casep  pEDITp  pBasically I want to see how good I can reconstruct the input matrix. For simplicity, say the original stands for a user who watched 4 movies. And then I want to know how good I can predict each user, based on just 1 movie that the user acually watched. I get a prediction for lots of movies. Then I plot a ROC and PrecisionRecall curve using topk of the prediction. And I will repeat all of this with n movies that the users actually watched. I will get a ROC curve in my plot for every n. When I come to the point where I use e.g. 4 movies that the user actually watched, to predict all movies he watched, but he only watched those 4, the results get too good.p  pThe reason why I am doing this is to see how many watched movies my system needs to make reasonable predictions. If it would return only good results when there are already 3 movies watched, It would not be so good in my application.p

Negative 1999 pWe have recently started a Hybrid project to work on iOS as well as Android with the following specificationsp  pHtml pages, Javascript file, Jquery based libraries files and resource files Images are hosted on a server. The hybrid code iOS or android loads the html pages in the web view and the page navigation and event handling is completely like any normal html and js based website. We have taken care of CORS for AJAX web service calls. The data is basically stored as local storagebrowsers support. p  pMost of the data that is viewed by the user is live from web service calls, Except some of the images captured using camera which will be stored locally in the application sandbox. For camera invocation, we have written native code.p  pWhy the architecture is planned in this way  One of the reasons   Any modification in the application will be handled right from the server as I mentioned that all the html and js files are centrally located on the server, Ofcourse also to skip the Apples App submission process.p  pNow I am not really sure if there might be any issues with this kind of application  the issues might be because 1. Whether Apple accepts such apps  2. Maintenance of the Project 3. Any critics on the architectural design of the App. p  pI am one small developer in this project, I have these questions for you. Apologize me if I havent put my doubts in appropriate way. Your critics and answerstips are most welcome. Thanks..p
Negative 1999 pLet us consider the problem of text classification. So if the document is represented as Bag of words , then  we will have an n dimensional feature , where n number of words in the document. Now if the I decide that I also want to use the document length as feature , then the dimension of this feature alone length  will be one. So how do I combine to use both the features length and Bag of words. Should consider the feature now as 2 dimensional ndimensional vectorBOW and 1dimensional featurelength. If this wont work , How do I combine the features. Any pointers on this will also be helpful   p

Changing RGBA would change both RGB and A, and so change the surface.p  pI dont know if this is possible, since I cant think of a way to do it with C.  However, I can think of some ideas.  For example, maybe theres a numpy array type that encapsulates some subarrays, and internally redirects indexing to the correct one at the C level.  This would be fine.p

Each codeUIButtoncode, when selected, opens a new codeviewcontrollercode with an enlarged view of the buttons image removed this code to make it more readable here.p  pHere is the problem each button successfully pushes a modal codeviewcontrollercode however, as I scroll down, sometimes the buttons pass the data from the same button from the section below it e.g. button1 in section 4 when clicked may pass the data for button1 in section 5. Similarly, as I scroll back up, sometimes the buttons pass the data from the same button from the section above it e.g. button5 in section 7 when clicked may pass the data for button5 in section 6. p  pI think this problem occurs because the iPhone is pulling the most recently loaded cell when codecellForRowAtIndexPathcode is called, but I would like it to pass the data for the row in which the button is located. p  pThoughts Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.p  pEdit Added data code as requestedp  precode UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView

Negative 1999 pI have a simple doubt about the flow of the below code snippet. I compare this code block both on the high level and assembly instruction level.

These two functions are setting two image types to codeICONIMAGEcode.p  pThe question is how the assignment and codeifcode are implementedp  pWhich conditional statements are highly optimized, codeifcode or ternary operator codecodep  pOn the assembly code level, to translate the codeifcode, codeCMPcode branch and codeMOVcode instructions are necessary.  And for the codecode operator, I think there are some special instructions but the branch instruction is completely avoided.p  pCan anyone tell which is the best method p  pIn codefoocode, the very first an assignment operation is done regardless of the if condition. It may not be needed all the time.p  pBut in codefoo1code, this is done in the codecode operator section and avoids the unwanted assignment operation.

Do I really need to possess graphical knowledge to create visuallyattractive applications Java is my homeland and I dont have a problem with any aspect of the actual programming.

Negative 1999 pI am currently writing a program that allows a manager to view some tables in an SQL 2008 R2 database and make changes to them. I have thoroughly tested the code on a database hosted on my development laptop and Ive discovered no issues. However, when I switch to a remote connection I start getting errors.p  pThe issue I have is that any attempt to collect data from the database provides only the number of columns. If I were to do a codeSELECT  FROM tablecode query and put it into a codeDataGridViewcode control. The codeSqlDataReadercode that I use to collect the data comes back with the exact number of fields in the table, no matter which table I select. Also, my code has no issues with actually logging in to the database to collect data. If I run the exact same code while targeting a local database on the laptop, I get all of the rows in that table from that database.p  pSo, I am getting data from the remote connection, its just only getting the number of columns in a table and no rows. I have codeTCPIPcode connections enabled, Im using the Server Browser, and all ports used by SQL and its processes are open on the server.p  pAnybody with a solution for this problem, or even a reason as to why its happening, would be greatly appreciated. Thanksp  pEdit, Solved Well, I figured out what the problem was. My App.config connection string was off by two characters and was grabbing data from an older copy of the current database. Thats why it was getting the same number of columns in the database but still failing to write anything to the data tables I had. Same number of columns, different column names. So when I went to assign the data it was looking for productType the new database instead of something like productTypeID older database.p

An example is shown below  p  precodelthtmlgt     ltbodygt         ltligt            ltpregt            ltDOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC IETFDTD HTML 2.0ENgt            lthtmlgt            ltheadgt            lttitlegt404 Not Foundlttitlegt            ltheadgtltbodygt            lth1gtNot Foundlth1gt            The page was not found on this server.            ltbodygt            lthtmlgt             ltpregt         ltligt     ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pI want that everything inside the pre tags must be taken as normal text and not html markup.

Negative 1999 pHere by similar I mean to say that my applications has set of questions with 56 pages. The types of the properties that I am going to use will be same for all my apps. the only thing that will change is the order where the question appears like page 123..p  pI have created some base types so that the same kind of apps will use those base types where most of the generic validations will be defined using data attributes.p  pas you can see in the image img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgnXPw.png altenter image description herep  pNow, I will have to create viewmodels for every individual views. The viewmodels will be able to use those base types in the form of properties and some app specific validations will be defined in the same viewmodel. p  pI have thought about this structure for all my apps because I would then be repeating the same stuff again and again. I understand that every view should have its own viewmodel. So, I will reference the base type assembly and create separate viewmodels for app taking only the types that I need for specific view. p  pIs this a good way to step ahead as I want to have a foundation for all my appsp

research.  First, I went to the JavaOracle website and found their tutorial  on drawing images and in fact my code very closely based on theirs, at least the  trycatch part.  Then I tried to remove the trycatch thing to see what the exception  would be I was 99 sure there would be one, lol.  Well my IDE NetBeans responded by  bugging out and basically forcing me to use one.  So then I went into the project folder  and checked to make sure the file was in the right place it was.  So just for the heck  of it, I copied it into every other folder in the project to see if that would help.  It  didnt.p  pSo its painfully obvious Ive done something wrong, and for whatever reason Java cant or  wont read the file, even though it exists and is in correct location and now every  location, but I have no idea what else to do about it.p  pSo, as always, Im open to any ideas, suggestions or other information.  Thanks in advance.  p

Negative 1999 pI am not a php expert nor a web developer, but Ive developed my own shopping cart in php and am hoping to intergrate PayPal. Ive done a lot of readings and used some sample code with not much luck half working. I am still hoping to be able to implement it, my questions arep  ol liHow do you differentiate if a requestresponse is IPN or PDTli lipOn a topic regarding IPN vs PDT, an answer saidp  pWith PDT you get the notification instantly and can do any additional processing required and show the user a confirmation page.p  pWith IPN you are guaranteed to be notified that the payment was received even if the users computer explodes before it can send you the PDT.pli lipWhy cant IPN be used to display a confirmation page I understand that IPN can also be triggered by PayPal or user, for example, a buyer initiates a dispute, and the listener handles the notification, hence under this situation, it cant be used to display confirmation page. But since you also specified a return URL with IPN, , then why cant this return URL be a page that displays a confirmation message or a thank you message Provided that the trigger was a new payment was madecompleted, etc. Or is there no way to tell who initiates a requestresponsepli lipSince IPN and PDT are so similar in fact, I dont know how to differentiate them, the information passing back and forth is the same, why cant I use IPNs return URL to display messages such as thank you for your purchasepli lipAlso, with question 2, point b, wont u still get the PDT message even if the users computer explodes as long as the transaction completed prior pli ol  pI am a bit lost, please help me with answers rather than asking me why do you want to do that, because if I know, I wont be here seeking help.

Negative 1999 pIm trying to set up a yii frontend to an existing database. By dint of history, it has several tables with negative IDs  theres a nice set of consecutive IDs from 1, but then there are a large set with large positive and negative IDs. No, I dont know why.p  pWhen using yii to retrieve one of these records from a listing all vanilla yii, the URL is something like codehttpmyyiipathindex.phphouses75313code. This then returns an error page saying unable to find the requested action. It works, retrieving the details of the record, when given a valid positive ID.p  pI understand yii uses codecode as a separator when selecting an action, so Im guessing the negative value is being interpreted as blankid. p  pSo can I either modify yii to use the default action with the signed value when no controller is specified, or can I direct the default action to some handler, or is it all a nightmarep

Negative 1999 pI would like to detect the client operating system using ASP.NET and C.  The HttpBrowserCapabilities class lets me determine the browser information very well, like Chrome and version 29.0.    BUT, it does not help me adequately with the operating system.  The platform property only returns WinNT.  Well, I am using Windows 7 and obviously not the older WinNT so on a practical level, this does not help me. p  pNow, I do know that I could parse out bits of the UserAgent string manually and look for things like Windows NT 6.1 and manually convert that to Windows 7.   I have no problem doing that for 5 or even 10 versions of Windows.  BUT, I definitely do not want to write manual code for all of these conversions for EVERY operating system on the planet.p  pDoes anyone know how I can detect the client OS from my web code without handwriting hundreds or thousands of lines of useragent parsing  I have seen other websites show You are using Windows 7 on their web pages.  I would prefer not to buy a 3rd party object for this.p

Negative 1999 pI have 9 differently colored buttons red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, offwhite and slate and I was wondering if it was possible to manipulate and alter only the color of the codetextshadowcode CSS property for these buttons, while keeping the other values the samep  pFor example, I have two different classes one is for buttons with 11px font size and the other is for 14px font size standard across my websitep  precode.button11      fontsize 0.8em     borderwidth 0.09091em     borderstyle solid     padding 0 0.90909em     textshadow 0.09091em 0.09091em 0 rgba0, 0, 0, 0.5     webkitboxshadow 0 0.09091em rgba255, 255, 255, 0.3 inset     mozboxshadow 0 0.09091em rgba255, 255, 255, 0.3 inset     boxshadow 0 0.09091em rgba255, 255, 255, 0.3 inset   .button14      borderwidth 0.07143em     borderstyle solid     padding 0 0.71429em     textshadow 0.07143em 0.07143em 0 rgba0, 0, 0, 0.5     webkitboxshadow 0 0.07143em rgba255, 255, 255, 0.3 inset     mozboxshadow 0 0.07143em rgba255, 255, 255, 0.3 inset     boxshadow 0 0.07143em rgba255, 255, 255, 0.3 inset  codepre  pFor those unaware, I have two separate classes because each font size requires different values for the borders and text shadow, since Im using the em measurement  0.09em equates to 1px at font size 11px, and 0.07em equates to 1px at font size 14px.p  pSo, in order to cut down on the CSS file size, it would help greatly if I could simply change the color of the codetextshadowcode CSS properties without having to include the other values.p  pDoes anyone know if this is possiblep  pThank you. p

Just curious where this entry came from Is it a NB bug or does it correspond to some project parameter I set and forgot about  Heres a partial list of my Boot Classpath from the source files using the Java 7 and 8p  precodeCProgram FilesJavajdk1.7.0jrelibjfxrt.jar ltStatic path using JVM 1.7.045 CProgram FilesJavajdk1.7.045jrelibresources.jar  CProgram FilesJavajdk1.7.045jrelibrt.jar  CProgram FilesJavajdk1.7.045jrelibsunrsasign.jar CProgram FilesJavajdk1.7.045jrelibjsse.jar ....

Negative 1999 pThis question could also be depending on how you look at it  How to use a for loop to do a basic math operation that adds up the sum of the multiples of 3p  pSo I am doing Problem 1 of Project Euler.p  pIve already hit a steelreinforced wall. I could use some help  with just a specific portion of the problem please I am not looking for just an answer to the problem, but rather, an answer to my specific problem so I can carry on with trying to solve the remainder problem using any answer you guys provide me here...p  pAnyways.p  pI think I created a for loop that will give me the multiples of 3. However, Im trying to store the result of each iteration of the forloop so that it adds up to the sum of those multiples i.e. Im trying to store the result from each iteration of the loop  whether it be into an array or into a variable that takes the sum of the multiples  it doesnt matter to me  I wouldnt mind learning both methods.p  pIm sure this sounds kind of confusing so let me paint my picture w an example...p  pI have a forloopp  precodefor i  1 i lt 3 i  var x  0 x  i  3 WHAT DO I DO NEXT codepre  p So I would think that this gives me x with a value of 3 upon the 1st iteration of the loop, x with a value of 9 on the 2nd loop, and x with a value of 18 on the final loop. Thats correct, right if this were returning 18 I dont think I would need to store the values of each iteration into an arrayp  p1st iteration p  precodei  1 x  0 codepre  pOriginal equation...p  precodei  3  x             codepre  pSo...p  precode1  3  x  0  3 codepre  pSo after completion of the 1st loop, x has a value of 3, right Question How would I store this value of x which is 3  how would I store it in an array while in this stage of the for loopp  p2nd iteration of loopp  precodei  2 x  3  2  3  x  3  9      codepre  psame question as before how would I add this value to an arrayp  p3rd iterationp  precodei  3 x  9  3  3  x  9  18       codepre  pQ shouldnt this be the final value of x upon completion of the for loop For some reason, when I run the code, the final value of x is 9, and not 18p  pSo, basically I am trying to add the sum of the 3 values...But what do I do next I thought my for loop would add the result of the equation after each loop to x, but instead of ending up w 18 the sum of code3  6  9code, xs value was 9p  pShould I use an array If so, Im thinking I could add the return value to an array, but Im not sure how to add the result of each iteration of the loop to an array. Maybe the following...p  precodefor i  1 i lt 3 i  var array  [] x  0 x  i 3  array.pushx  codepre  p I tried running that in jfiddle, but it would only add the last value of x 9 into the array... So how would I add the value of x to an array emafter each iteration of the for loopem And Im not seeing whats wrong with my forloop to where its returning a value of x as 9 p  pAlso, Im assuming the euler problems get significantly more difficult as we progress If so, Ive got a TON of workpractice to do....p  pTHANKS IN ADVANCE...p

So I thought I build a publishsubscribe pattern with SNS and SQS.p  pWhen a new application instance is starting, it creates a new SQS queue and subscribes to the topic. So far, so good. But what if the autoscaler shuts down an instancep  pIs there any possibility to catch the shutdown event Or do you have any Ideas for other implementationsp

Why is this peculiar behavior both the query are same , one with project of columnsproperties other is without any projection, but Azure table storage provides same number of entity with same column property and same size of each entity why is it Azure table storage is taking too much of time in the first query why is it faster in second query.

The AJAX basket update action strongis differentstrong from the product view action. The empage element basket countem is as previously mentioned available throughout the site and also one extra basket product specific element on the product view page. Since I am using the SessionHelper for the basket count sitewide, wrapping the empage elements basketem count with codeltnocachegt ltnocachegtcode would make it possible to cache pretty much all pages given the actionsviews updating the basket wouldnt be cached.

I understand the mistake here, since there are multiple invoices, the companies are repeated each time, and cant be ordered by time.

Negative 1999 pIm having segfault issues with my latest project. Ive ran my program under valgrind but Im having difficulty interpreting the output. Ive looked at a hrefhttpvalgrind.orgdocsmanualmcmanual.htmlmcmanual.errormsgs relnofollowthe manual for valgrinda, but even that doesnt make it clear when a particular error message is a problem or not. For instance, it says, Still Reachable blocks are very common and arguably not a problem, but Im not experienced enough to differentiate when theyre acceptable and when theyre not. Could someone please look at my valgrind log and give me some insight as to whats going on with my code, and which of the reported errors are genuine concerns p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comeindacorBigNum relnofollowHeres a link to all of my code as well as the valgrind log.a p  pTo give a brief description of when the segfault occurs during runtime, the program works like this It takes a string input by the user, and generates a list of calculator items which includes numbers, symbols, and parentheses. The program then analyzes the list, and reduces it just as you would by hand. If the equation is 1894, it will remove 94, solve for 94, then add the solution back into the original list to make it 1813. My program returns a segfault error after the list has been reduced to a single element. At this point a hrefhttpsgithub.comeindacorBigNumblobmastermain.cppL237 relnofollowline 237 in main.cppa its supposed to verify that the only remaining element is a number, which means thats the final answer, but it wont dereference the iterator. Im not sure if that helps, because I realize the memory could have been allocateddeallocated incorrectly earlier in the program, but that is where my program fails consistently.p  pIf I need to be more specific about the way my program works I wouldnt mind going into more detail, but Im not really sure what is relevant or where the problem might be. I should note that Im very new to smart pointers, and Ive had lots of memory issues with those before, so theres a good chance the way I handle memory with those is the culprit. My smart pointer is declared in a hrefhttpsgithub.comeindacorBigNumblobmasterbignumdecs.h relnofollowbignumdecs.ha as codecalcptrcode and its functions are defined in a hrefhttpsgithub.comeindacorBigNumblobmasterbignumclassdefs.cpp relnofollowbignumclassdefs.cppa on line 1410.

For example, when a process like cat is given, the process then forks into a parent and child, with the child writing to the parents standard in, so that the next process can read from the standard in, right Unless there is no next process, in which case it just writes to standard outp  pHowever, isnt it an error to write to standard in How does the next process get the previous processs output then if it reads from standard in Say, if we had cat  cat.p
Negative 1999 pMy code is throwing an error that Ive never seen before. So hey I guess Im learning  Anyway, I did some reading and generally this error is thrown when a list that is being iterated over is modified miditeration. However, Im pretty sure Im not modifying it. While the error is being thrown on partition, if I dont assign a new value for currentList in updateCurrentList by commenting out the code, the program no longer throws the error. These two functions are called one after the other in my play method, however the list iteration should be complete by the time the change is made.

Negative 1999 pFirst time here, it says to be specific... So here goes.p  pIm doing a small project to connect Salesforce to my Raspberry Pi. The goal is to make a light Think a beacon, sirenlike light flash when a high priority case comes in from a client in Salesforce. At the moment, clients usually send an email to a certain address, and this creates a case. It goes to the Unassigned Queue and emails the team that this case is there waiting to be assigned.p  pSalesforce uses REST, so I need to be able to get the Pi to accept JSON so it can easily understand what Salesforce wants it to do.p  pCurrently, I guess I have won half of the battle. I have a web server Lighttpd running on the Pi, which hosts an index page and a Python script. I am also using a Python wrapper, which allows me to easily run a command from a Telldus program I have installed. This program controls a USB RF Transmitter that I have connected, it is paired to a RF Socket, which is connected to the mains power supply with a light connected to it.p  pSo the Python script is called power.py, and can be controlled with URL variables, so if I go to power.pydevice1amppoweronamptime10amppasswordhunter2 that turns on device 1 for 10 seconds. I also created a POST form on the index page, which just POSTS to the python script, and runs it in the same way as using the URL variables. That all works great.p  pSo all I need to do, is connect it to Salesforce. I would like to use REST and JSON, so that if I ever move away from Salesforce to another CRM program, it will easily be able to adapt and receive instructions from new places.p  pI have posted the Python script I am using here a hrefhttpsgithub.com7ewisRemotePiControlblobmasterpower.py relnofollowhttpsgithub.com7ewisRemotePiControlblobmasterpower.pyap  pThe Pi isnt currently allowed out of the local network, so I will need to somehow develop a way to send JSON commands, and the recieve and convert them to work using the correct variables etc. Im not a programmer, Ive just exposure to languages from hacking things and exploring. Hence why I need some guidance with this.p  pI have never used REST or JSON before, so what would I need to do to achieve thisp

Clearly mess arises when I have to program all the possible outcomes of the form submissions in both views in the base view, if an invalid form is submited, it says in the view and displays the error, without going to the see view in the see view, if an invalid form is submited it will stay in the see view, display the error, but has to keep displaying what it was showing before the submission in the see template you get the messp  pDo you have any advices on how should I structure this Basicly I want to have some part of the html to be always the same, but different views to be called according to input. Should I use jQuery to handle some sort of generalized form submissionsp  pSorry for the long code and thanks in advance,p

However, almost all of the examples I have seen have created a new thread within the current class and, for example, passed an anonymous method to Dispatcher.Invoke.p  pOne exception to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9602567howtoupdateuifromanotherthreadrunninginanotherclassthisa discussion which advocated using an EventHandler and initializing it in the main window.  That seems less than ideal but maybe I am wrong.p  pFurther down, someone else advocated data sharing.  Again, that seems less than ideal to me.p  pOther articles I have read appear to be out of date.p  pSo, I welcome any explanations on how to go about this.  It may be that I am just getting hung up syntactically but I suspect that, although I think I am mostly clear on delegates, lambdas, etc., I am probably hung up on what exactly needs to get done.  p  pIf you can show how it would be done in this specific example with some explanation, I would greatly appreciate it.p  pAnd maybe some specific questions on some points that are a little hazy for mep  p1 Can my worker task access on it on its own or must it be provided with the UIs Dispatcherp  p2 Should the UI provide a delegate that performs the dispatch or should the dispatch be coded in the worker task, referencing the UI Dispatcher  p  pThanks very much.p

Negative 1999 pWe are implementing clickjacking protection using the XFrameOptions header and empossiblyem the JSCSS setup described on this pagep  pa hrefhttpswww.owasp.orgindex.phpClickjackingDefenseCheatSheet relnofollowhttpswww.owasp.orgindex.phpClickjackingDefenseCheatSheetap  pFor reference, the JSCSS solution looks like thisp  precodeltstyle idantiClickjackgtbodydisplaynone importantltstylegt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt    if self  top       var antiClickjack  document.getElementByIdantiClickjack      antiClickjack.parentNode.removeChildantiClickjack     else       top.location  self.location     ltscriptgt codepre  pGiven the widespread support of the XFrameOptions header in all modern browsers, Im wondering if we should even keep the JS frame killer in place. Maybe just for good measure If we do, we have the caveat that we use colorbox to generate iframe popups from within our own domain. This can be accommodated in the XFrameOptions header by setting it to SAMEORIGIN, but Im at a loss as to how I would modify the JS to allow frames from the same domain without it being easily circumvented.p  pAs it is, the script compares codeself  topcode and removes the codedisplaynonecode from the body style if they are the same. I can modify the condition to also check for the domain like sop  precodeif self  top  this.top.location.hostname  www.example.com codepre  pBut this uses the codelocationcode object which can be changed from the framing page, effectively bypassing the script. Basically, Im looking for something similar to this downvoted suggestion herep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma21900420998048httpstackoverflow.coma21900420998048ap  pSo, 2 questionsp  p1. Is it still considered best practice or even necessary to implement frame killing with JSp  p2. If so, is there a better, more secure way to keep the JS in place but still allow frames from our own domainp

Negative 1999 pI need to create a web application that uses WIF to communicate with ADFS in order to login users. This web application supports multitenancy, accordingly, the same code base will be used to serve requests to codesite1.mydomain.comcode and codesite2.mydomain.comcode.p  pCurrently, my WIF configuration is in the codeweb.configcode file which is preventing me from achieving multitenancy.

Negative 1999 pIn one of my projects I have concurrent write access to one single file within one JRE and want to handle that by first writing to a temporary file and afterwards moving that temp file to the target using an atomic move. I dont care about the order of the write access or such, all I need to guarantee is that any given time the single file is usable. Im already aware of Files.move and such, my problem is that I had a look at at least one implementation for that method and it raised some doubts about if implementations really guarantee atomic moves. Please look at the following codep  pa hrefhttpgrepcode.comfilerepository.grepcode.comjavarootjdkopenjdk7u40b43javaniofileFiles.javaFiles.move28java.nio.file.Path2Cjava.nio.file.Path2Cjava.nio.file.CopyOption5B5D29 relnofollowFiles.move on GrepCode for OpenJDKap  precode1342        FileSystemProvider provider  providersource 1343        if providertarget  provider  1344             same provider 1345            provider.movesource, target, options 1346         else  1347             different providers 1348            CopyMoveHelper.moveToForeignTargetsource, target, options 1349         codepre  pThe problem is that the option ATOMICMOVE is not considered in all cases, but the location of the source and target path is the only thing that matters in the first place. Thats not what I want and how I understand the documentationp  blockquote   pIf the move cannot be performed as an atomic file system operation then   AtomicMoveNotSupportedException is thrown. This can arise, for example, when the target   location is on a different FileStore and would require that the file be copied, or target   location is associated with a different provider to this object.p blockquote  pThe above code clearly violates that documentation because it falls back to a copydeletestrategy without recognizing ATOMICMOVE at all. An exception would be perfectly OK in my case, because with that a hoster of our service could change his setup to use only one filesystem which supports atomic moves, as thats what we expect in the system requirements anyway. What I dont want to deal with is things silently failing just because an implementation uses a copydeletestrategy which may result in data corruption in the target file. So, from my understanding it is simply not safe to rely on Files.move for atomic operations, because it doesnt always fail if those are not supported, but implementations may fall back to a copydeletestrategy.p  pIs such behaviour a bug in the implementation and needs to get filed or does the documentation allow such behaviour and Im understanding it wrong Does it make any difference at all if I now already know that such maybe broken implementations are used out there I would need to synchronize the write access on my own in that case...p

Negative 1999 pI have a VBScript that errors when I try to get Excels status bar string. See comments in code below. I tried putting objExcel.DisplayStatusBar  True in above the erroneous line, but then that line errors. That tells me something about objExcel is going wrong. If I put in a msgbox just prior to the erroneous line, it hangs the entire vbs expected. This vbs runs in the morning so when I see the msgbox popup and click OK all systems have already completed except the vbs that is hanging because of the msgbox. I click OK on the msgbox and I get no error. The reason I am waiting with a timed loop is because macro CreateModel has some Application.OnTime calls in it back to CreateModel, which is necessary for reasons that are beyond this question. The VBScript doesnt know that I have OnTime calls so if I dont wait it will proceed with the rest of the vbs code and mess things up for other reasons. So I have to wait and I use the statusbar to know when all is finished. I cant do a purely timed wait because the processing time of CreateModel and its associated OnTime calls varies quite a bit.p  pIt is a little confusing. Looking for debug suggestions andor solutions if you have any.p  pEDIT if someone knows how to create the error call rejected by callee for line sStatus  objExcel.StatusBar, that would help me debug this.p  pEDIT2 Here is a picture of the error.

Negative 1999 pI have a loginview and its loginmodel. loginmodel is created from the initialize of the mainrouter. this way according to the loginmodels loginp attribute mainrouters coderenderhomecode decides whether to render homeview or navigate to login route which calls coderenderlogincode. coderenderlogincode have a method to codesavecode  the loginmodel populated from the loginviews input fields.

Negative 1999 pIm working on a TCPIP stack for a networks course, and am currently working on implementing a rudimentary TCP system. With IP and UDP you get fields in the header that allow you to know the number of bytes in the payload, but as far as I can see, there is nothing like this in TCP. The client will send a value in the window size field during the opening handshake to indicate the maximum number of bytes it will accept, but there is no field that actually says how many bytes of data come after the header in a given packet.p  pSequence and acknowledgment numbers are used to give the offset of bytes being sent and the next expected offset, but they cannot tell you how many bytes have come in the current packet.p  pIm assuming I can just pass the length from the IP header down to the TCP handler, but Id just like to verify that thats the proper way to do it.p

Negative 1999 pSo im working on a project for school, in which I have created a database with the information for all the chemicals on the periodic table, and upon running the program, the user is prompted to pick between a few options, such as search, sort, etc. Like thisp  precode String[] options  new String[] Search, Sort, Add, Delete, Exit     int xJOptionPane.showOptionDialognull, Choose one of the following, Virtual Periodic        Table, JOptionPane.DEFAULTOPTION, JOptionPane.PLAINMESSAGE,             null, options, options[0]      while true              if options[x]Search                                                  searchMenu                     else if options[x]Sort                             else if options[x]Add                             else if options[x]Delete                             else if options[x]Exit                      break               codepre  pI am not quite finished, as of right now I am still working on the search option. Anyways, upon clicking the search option, I call a procedure which pops up another menu which prompts the user to specify what they would like to search by, like thisp  precode String[] options  new String[] Name, Symbol, Atomic Number, Atomic Mass,  of Valence     Electrons, Go Back     int xJOptionPane.showOptionDialognull, What would you like to search by, Virtual  Periodic Table, JOptionPane.DEFAULTOPTION, JOptionPane.PLAINMESSAGE,             null, options, options[0]      if options[x]Name                                          searchByName           else if options[x]Symbol                 else if options[x]Atomic Number                 else if options[x]Atomic Mass                 else if options[x] of Valence Electrons                      else if options[x]Go Back            codepre  pNow, I am trying to figure out a way in which I can give the user the option to go back to the main menu so they can do something else with the data. For example if i decide to search but then i decide i want to actually sort, I can simply press Go Back and it will popup the previous menu, which was the main menu, so I can choose what I want to do next. I have added the button which says Go Back but im not quite sure how to make it so it actually gives command back to the main method which can popup the main menu again. I tried to put the search menu in a while loop and then making it break out of the loop if they were to click Go Back but it didnt no anything but close the entire program.p  pIm still fairly new to GUI in Java, anybody know what i can do p
Negative 1999 pI recently created a script to create a Dragon Curve, and managed to optimize the code quite a bit.  Basically, i start by generating a list of rules, looking something like code[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]code, where 1 represents a right turn, and 1 represents a left turn. This goes very fast with numpy arrays.p  pMore on the dragon curve a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDragoncurve relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiDragoncurveap  pHowever, now i want to create a curve in the plane using this list. Basically pick a point x, y, and a direction east, walk one step, and turn 90 degrees right or left depending on the current element in the list, which we loop over. We also take an extra step at the end, but that shouldnt matter to the question.p  pLets say that our starting position is 100, 100, we start going east, and the list is code[1, 1, 1]code. Then we should get code[100, 100, 101, 100, 101, 101, 101, 101, 100, 101, 100, 102]code, which gives us the second iteration of the dragon curve. p  pCurrently Im using the following code to generate the sequence of pointsp  precodepos  [100, 100] ang  math.pi2 for i in dragon  [0]     pos.extend[pos[2]math.cosang, pos[1]math.sinang]     ang  imath.pi2 codepre  pwhere codedragoncode is the previously generated list, e.g. code[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]code. I add [0] to take an extra step at the end. For 19 iterations my script outputsp  precodearray of length 1048575 completed in 0.00567 seconds dragon created in 2.82039 seconds dragon drawn in 0.01462 seconds image saved in 0.01229 seconds codepre  pWe can clearly see that the code above is the most timecomsuming. Is there a faster way to generate all these points from the list we previously generatedp
Negative 1999 pI am having an issue where I am able to authenticate when running as a Console Application.  But when I make it a Windows Service and install it, I am unable to authenticate.  I have used log debug statements to isolate the issue.p  precodeUserCredential credential  GoogleWebAuthorizationBroker.AuthorizeAsync         new ClientSecrets              ClientId  myClientId,             ClientSecret  myClientSecret         ,         new[]              CalendarService.Scope.Calendar         ,         myProjectName,         CancellationToken.None,         new FileDataStoremyProjectName .Result codepre  pThe issue is with the above statement.  This is surrounded by a trycatch, but no Exception is thrown.  There is a log statement immediately after this, but it is never executed.  My best guess is that the issue is with the FileDataStore.  By default Google stores this is AppData which my program can find when I run it manually, but when it is a web service I am forced to give it an account type like Local System or Local Service I need to set it as User I think.  My guess is that this prevents it from finding the file in AppData.  Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to help the Windows Service find AppData  Or is a Windows Service a bad approach in this situationp  pThank you in advance for any help.p

Mainly I get the 3251 error saying my connection is Read Only or a missing ISAM when I add ReadOnly0 to the connection string. Fyi, getProjectFile just returns a path to a file starting from the parent folder of my project. I am pretty sure I can just use the connDB.Execute so I only need SQL Insert, I dont want to query first because the queries will get fat quick.

Negative 1999 pI have observed that when a method of certain class is marked as codefinalcode in C11, there is no lookup in the vtable to call that method, even from pointers, at least with the assembly produced by GCC.

The call to DerivedFinalmethod does not require any vtable lookup, while the call to DerivedNotFinalmethod requires an indirection. In my opinion, this behavior with the final keyword is desired in certain performancecritical applications, which is why I ask if the behavior is standard.p

Negative 1999 pI have written a simple COM object in C with only one method, which is called GetMac.  I cant get it to work.  I am trying to access it from a legacy Borland C Builder 4 BCB4 application, which I know is old, and not used much anymore, but I am able to access other COM objects from it fine.p  pThe Borland development machine is running Windows XP, so I make the C COM object target the .NET 4.0 framework.  I copied the DLL and PDB file over from the C Visual Studio machine to the XP machine.  I registered it via the following commandp  precodeWINDIRMicrosoft.NETFrameworkv4.0.30319regasm.exe TRSDotNetCOM.dll tlb nologo codebase codepre  pI am able to instantiate the COM object class fine via the following line of codep  precodeVariant TDN  CreateOleObjectTRSDotNetCOM.TRSCOMClass codepre  pIf I change the name string, it doesnt work, so I know I have this part correct.p  pHowever, when I try to call the method as followsp  precodeMacV  TDN.OleFunctionfuncNameV,counterV,macKeyV codepre  p... I get a runtime exception unfortunately, theres an issue with BCB4s exception handling for OLE calls, so the only info the debugger gives me is Exception Occurred.p  pSince I am able to call other COM objects from the same BCB4 application in the same manner, I dont think the problem is with my C code.  I think it is an issue with either the Ccreated COM DLL, or the registration thereof.p  pTo explore this, I used Microsoft OLECOM Object Viewer to browse my system for the OLE object.  I was able to find my object as TRSDotNetCOM.TRSCOMClass, as expected.p  pIm brand new at using the OLECOM Object Viewer, so I hope I am looking at the right things belowp  pWhen I expand the class, I see the following img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKqKqS.png altMy class expandedp  pI rightclicked on Object and chose View, then View Type Info.

Negative 1999 pI am trying to get Jenkins to start a virtual machine on a Jenkins slave. The VM itself will then act as a Jenkins slave. In order to do so I need to boot the VM and keep it running, even after the Jenkins job terminates. I have tried to create a freestyle project which runs a batch script on the slave and checks if the VM is runningp  precodeCProgram Files x86VMwareVMware Workstationvmrun.exe T ws start DVMMyVM.vmx  CProgram Files x86VMwareVMware Workstationvmrun.exe list codepre  pThe second command shows me that the VM is actually up and running, but apparently it directly shuts down again since I cant see the node that corresponds to the VM as online. p  pThe Jenkins Slave agent is installed as a Windows service on the VMs host and logs in as a domain user. p  pIf I switch the first command top  precodeCProgram Files x86VMwareVMware Workstationvmware.exe x DVMMyVM.vmx codepre  pthe VM powers on, the node gets connected to Jenkins. This is because somehow the batch script gets stuck after this command and does not terminate, so the VM remains powered on. However, if I log on the host with the same user the Jenkins service uses, I cannot see the VM running.p  pIronically, I can in fact power OFF any virtual machine that I have started locally on the host from Jenkins by creating a project with the batch commandp  precodeCProgram Files x86VMwareVMware Workstationvmrun.exe T ws stop DVMMyVM.vmx soft codepre  pSo, to summarize  I want to create a Jenkins job that powers on a VM so I can use it as a slave agent. The VM has to remain powered on even after the job is done, I will shut it down with a different job as needed. But only the shutdown job is working as intended.p

Negative 1999 pWe have a whole slew of custom written web applications on our company intranet.  Weve had multiple developers at one time or another work on any one of them.  Over time we have gone to newer versions of Visual Studio as well.  We have some applications that are very old that never needed to be recompiled that still run on Framework version 1.1, some under 2, others 3xx.  We are getting an error message on IIS that It is not possible to run two different versions of ASP.NET in the same IIS process and then it causes a deadlock and hangs the server.  We have separate application pools created for each Framework version.  Since there are a number of apps running in any one of the app pools I need to isolate the app that is running under the wrong frameworkapp pool.  I would like to be able to check each and every .Net app to see what Framework version it is compiled to run under but I do not know how to tell by looking at the compiled dll or the config file, .vbproj or .csproj file, or what have you.  Can somebody tell me how I might be able to find this information for each of the apps running on our web serverp

Negative 1999 pLibraries like mathjax and katex can render complex formulas on the web, without any plugins. Is there any information on how this is accomplishedp  pFrom my limited understanding of existing fonts, font shapes are essentially fixed. For example, I can increase or reduce the size of letter A, make it italic or bold, but there is no mechanism for arbitrarily change its shape for a given font. p  pLibraries like mathjaxkatex, on the other hand, seem to do things which should not be possible for standard fonts. For example, take the square root sign. There can be a single function enclosed by the square root sign, or there can be an arbitrarily long and complex expression under it. The square root symbol adjusts accordingly. How is that possible p  pOne possibility is that these math fonts are not fonts in the typical sense. They are just svg lines and curves as far as html is concerned. However, that doesnt seem to be the case, since I can select parts of an expression, the way I might select a few words in a sentence.p  pI am asking this because some human languages, like arabicpersianurdu are not rendered very nicely on most web pages, and the reasons seems to be because the individual characters or parts of characters change according to what proceeds or follows the character. In other words, these languages need an algorithm which is context sensitive, which doesnt seem to be the case for most text rendering engines.p  pCurious to learn how math formulas are rendered so I can figure out how to use that technology to render Urdu specifically nastaleeqp

Negative 1999 pReal quick, seems like kind of a dumb question but I cant find the answer anywhere.p  pI need a vertical menu that pops up out of the footer and goes up the screen.p  pIve been looking at the Ajax Collapsible Panel Extender but cant get it to go up instead of down.p  pIm limited to the software already loaded in the virtual profile I have here at work no admin, cant get cool new things so if its something available in CSS, VB.NET, ASP or AJAX that would be spiffy, otherwise Ill need to find something else to do.p  pWhat Im looking for is a control I can use to have a menu appear upwards instead of downwards.

Negative 1999 pI know this is a long shot.p  pWhat Im hoping is that there is a way to deploy multiple copies of a Web.config file to the production environment as part of packaged code lets call them codeWeb.config.prodcode and codeWeb.config.prodTestcode so that regression testers can test on a disconnected production server using codeprodTestcode in a different namespace e.g., prodtest.com prior to making it go live say, using codeprodcode on prod.com without doing two separate deployments.p  pShort of making a PowerShell script to swap out the values, I cant think of a good way to do this. Every project Ive seen so far has a single .config file made as part of the build.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestionsp  pThanksp

Negative 1999 pIm using Angular to design the front end of an app, whose content will be dynamically updated based on the contents of a back end database. The database would be accessed through a server that I will use AJAX on to get the data from. My issue is with two things.p  pThe first needs a bit of explanation as to how the website would be structured. In one of the views theres a lot of categories. You can go to a category, which can in turn have another set of categories, and then another and another and so on to infinity... The front end will only get one level at a time  just an array of names and descriptions to display.p  pI have absolutely no idea how to do that in ngRoute or UI Router.p  pThen Ill need to have breadcrumbs that route back to the previous views, they need to display the names of the categories you have been through, but the URL is supposed to have the representative IDs of the categories.p  pAn example would be xxx.comcategoriescategoryIdcategoryIdcategoryIdsomething elsep  pHeres how one category would lookp  precode id 4, name AppServers, description Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

Negative 1999 pI am having trouble reading large messages sent to a TcpListener from a TcpClient using BeginReceive  BeginSend in C.  p  pI have tried to append a four byte length header to my messages, but on occasion I will not receive it as the first packet which is causing problems.p  pFor example, I sent a serialized object that contains the values [204, 22, 0, 0] as the first four bytes of the byte array in my BeginSend.  What I receive on the server in the BeginReceive is [17, 0, 0, 0].  I have checked Wireshark when sending simple strings and the messages are going through, but theres a problem with my code.  Another example, is when I send A b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 to test I constantly receive p q r . . . 8 9 0.p  pI thought that if packets were received out of order or if one was dropped, TCP would handle the resubmission of the lost packets andor reorder them before sending them up.  This would mean that my first four bytes should always contain my message size in the header.  However, looking at the above examples this isnt the case, or it is and my code is messed up somewhere.p  pAfter the code below I just look if its sending a particular command or type of object then responding based on what was received.p  pOne I have the core functionality in place and get a better understanding of the issue I can begin to refactor, but this really has me at a stand still.p  pIve been banging my head against a wall for days trying to debug this.  I have read several articles and questions about similar problems, but I havent found a way to apply the suggested fixes to this particular instance.p  pThanks in advance for your assistance with this.  p  pemThe YahtzeeClient in the following code is just a wrapper around TcpClient with playerinformation.emp  precode    private void ReceiveMessageCallbackIAsyncResult AR              byte[] response  new byte[0]         byte[] header  new byte[4]         YahtzeeClient c  YahtzeeClientAR.AsyncState         try                       If the client is connected             if c.ClientSocket.Client.Connected                              int received  c.ClientSocket.Client.EndReceiveAR                   If we didnt receive a message or a message has finished sending                  reset the messageSize to zero to prepare for the next message.                 if received  0                                      messageSize  0                       Do we need to do anything else here to prepare for a new message                      Clean up buffers                                  else                                       Temporary buffer to trim any blanks from the message received.                     byte[] tempBuff                       Hacky way to track if this is the first message in a series of messages.

Negative 1999 pI have created the UI as follows in the below code.I have a serial tab and relay tab and also add buttons in them.I also have 6 buttons numbered 16.  I want to add values to the jtable.When serial port tab add is clicked it should added when any one of the button in selected.how when relay tab add is clicked same thing should be continued.p  pMy Doubt isp  pIf button 1 is pressed and values are added and again When button 2 is pressed table should be made empty and new values should be allowed to add to the table and again if i click back button 1 is clicked it should display values which were added to button 1 previously and also allowed to add new values and this should happen the same with all the buttons.p  pI tried using hash map,

Negative 1999 pThe code below uses the native node codevmcode library, which allows you to evaluate javascript strings in different contexts.p  pThe particular code within codeexample.jscode theres a javascript string that adds a property code.markercode with the value codetruecode to the codeArraycode global variable, then requires a file codeglobal.jscode seen below, then logs codeArray.markercode. The code below logs codetruecode.p  precodevar vm  requirevm  var code  [   Array.marker  true,   require.global.js,   console.logArray.marker,  gt true ].joinn  var script  new vm.Scriptcode,  filename example.js   script.runInNewContext   require require,   console console  codepre  pBelow is the contents of codeglobal.jscode, which is a simple module that changes the value of codeArray.markercode to codefalsecode. p  precodevar hi  function     Array.marker  false  module.exports  hi codepre  pWhat should be happening here is that the code within the codevmcode should be setting codeArray.markercode to codetruecode then the codeglobal.jscode module should be changing it the value to codefalsecode and it should log codefalsecode. p  pIf you go ahead and run the contents of the javascript string outside of codevmcode, in its own file, you will get the expected result, codeArray.markercode will be equal to codefalsecode. p  precodeArray.marker  true require.global.js console.logArray.marker  gt false codepre  pThe question is emWhy doesnt codeArray.markercode get updated to the correct value codetruecodeem emHow can I allow the value of codeArray.markercode to get updated from within the codeglobal.jscode moduleemp  pIs this an issue with the native node.js codevmcode module Or is this not supposed to be possible Or are my settings offp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI think the bug goes a little deeper. It has more to do with the behavior of the imported coderequirecode then it does with codevmcode, to demonstrate that a bit more accurately. p  pHere I change the value of codeArray.markercode from within a new vm context, and you can see it has no effect on the global codeArray.markercode after the vm runs. This is expected behavior because I didnt pass anything into codevmcode.p  precodevar vm  requirevm var code  [   Array.marker  true, ].joinn vm.runInNewContextcode console.logArray.marker  gt undefined [expected] codepre  pHowever when I bring coderequirecode into the codevmcode something very unexpected happens. The code required maintains the scope of the parent context. So with the given code, you get unexpected results. The global within the vm script codeArray.markercode is not changed due to the require call, and you can see the require call is editing the parent scope by setting codeArray.markercode.p  precodevar vm  requirevm var code  [   Array.marker  true,   require.global.js,   console.logArray.marker  gt true [unexpected] ].joinn vm.runInNewContextcode,    require require,   console console  console.logArray.marker  gt false [unexpected] codepre  pThe real question is how can instantiate a new instance of coderequirecode within a codevmcode rather then importing the parents Keeping it localized to the codevmcode rather then allowing it to leak into the parent.p

I guess if I use scope then Ill have to keep track of all the variables across all controllersp  pIn any case, I have a feeling Im using the wrong model here but any guidance would be appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1999 pI am using one of those online application builders to build an android application. But from what i have researched, online application builders are used to build hybrid mobile applications. Since these are HTML files, they use the inApp browser and are rendered in WebView. So, My question is  Is webviewinApp Browser capable of remembering the session information suppose I have users log into a website by displaying it in a webview. Will the users be still logged in if they visit the website a second time When I test these applications in an online environment running inside a fullyfledged browser, the application seems to remember the user. I suspect this is because the test environment itself is contained within the browser which stores the session information. So, If a user was to sign into a website on a real device, will heshe be required to sign in every time the user launches an application or will heshe remain signed in until sign outp

I have tried printing out the error but to no avail.p  precodeif conn   echo Connection established.ltbr gt FnamePOST[FirstName]  LnamePOST[LastName]  sql  INSERT INTO testTable userFirstName, userLastName VALUES ,  params  arrayFname, Lname stmt  sqlsrvquery conn, sql, params     if stmt  false           echo sqlsrverrors          else          echo Data transmitted successfully.ltbr gt           codepre  pThe script above is what breaks. The weird thing is when I comment out the ifstmt  false etc, the script runs perfectly fine and the data gets inserted.p  precodeif conn   echo Connection established.ltbr gt FnamePOST[FirstName]  LnamePOST[LastName]  sql  INSERT INTO testTable userFirstName, userLastName VALUES ,  params  arrayFname, Lname stmt  sqlsrvquery conn, sql, params   if stmt  false         echo sqlsrverrors      else        echo Data transmitted successfully.ltbr gt     codepre  pThe above code works. Any ideas what could be causing it on my webserverp  pSpeaking of my webserver, I am running it through godaddys web hosting service. In particular, I am using plesk for windows hosting.p
