Positive 16383 pI am not using a navigation controller control this view because the navigation controller forces me to use segues that I do not want to use and Im not sure how to over write those segues, Ive tried multiple things but they always lead to a crash although, the good thing about using the navigation controller, among many other things, is that there is no space between the navigation bar and the top of the phone. p  pHowever, because I want to use my own custom segues, I just added a navigation bar to my view controller.

Positive 16383 pI have a UITableView which has a navigation bar that can seque to a View Controller of my app via a UINagivationController. The Table View is editable, where I can delete a cell.p  pI have found what I think is a bug. When I swipe from left to right the tableview goes away to reveal the view Controller. However, if I only half commit to the swipe and only go 34 of the way not fully going to the View Controller and return back to the Table View, the navigation bar is removed. I have programmatically removed the navigation bar of the view controller, but I have not removed it from Table View Controller. It is incredibly important for my table view to have the navigation bar, as it is the only way that I can return to the view controller once the navigation bar is gone,  it no longer allows for me to segue back to the View Controller by using the left to right swipe for some reason.p  pHas anyone seen this problem Is there code that I need to add to ensure that the Navigation bar does not disappear p

Positive 16383 pI have an UITabBarController that has 3 UINavigationController within. What I am trying to do, is on the push of a button on the UINavigationControllers bar, to drop the bar all the way down to right above the UITabBarControllers bar. I am doing this so that I can display in a pull down fashion, more content that would fill in the area above the now lowered UINavigationBar and then go away when it is moved up. So, in essence, I want to move around the UINavigationBar of a UINavigationController. I will only need this slideup down behavior of the UINavigationBar in the root view controllers of the respective UINavigationControllers of each tab. I have tried to just reposition the bar on the UINavigation controller like so...p  precode IBAction func moveBarDownsender AnyObject       self.navigationController.navigationBar.frame  CGRectx 100, y 500, width 100, height 100        note that I just used bogus values for demonstration purposes. codepre  pHowever, I get something like this...p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comPoKbj.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comPoKbj.png altenter image description hereap  pAs you can see, the navigation bar extends all the way to the top even though it only has a height of 100. This leads me to believe that I am not supposed to resize and move around the UINavigationBar on a UINavigationController and move it around. So, was thinking and researching some other ways of getting this same functionality. p  p1 Fake it I was thinking that I could just programmatically insert an identical but fake navigation bar not connected to a UINavigationController, hide the real UINavigationBar attached to the navigation controller, and then move the fake one around as needed. Then, on the slide up, I could move fake navigation bar back up, unhide the real one, and then delete the fake navigation bar.p  p2 Implement my own sort of navigation controller I was reading that I could use a container view to implement my own navigation controller. I am not familiar with doing such a thing, and dont even know if implementing my own UINavigationController would be a good thing to do.p  pSo, my question is, how would I achieve the desired functionality of moving the UINavigationBar on a UINavigationController Is there some way that I am totally missing Any comments, suggestions, or recommendations are greatly appreciated. Thanks.p

Negative 16383 pPerhaps the biggest risk in pushing new functionality to live lies with the database modifications required by the new code.

Negative 16383 pWhat is a strongnon recursivestrong algorithm for deciding whether a passed in amount can be built additively from a set of numbers.br In my case Im determining whether a certain currency amount such as 40 can be met by adding up some combination of a set of bills such as 5, 10 and 20 bills.  That is a simple example, but the algorithm needs to work for any currency set some currencies use funky bill amounts and some bills may not be available at a given time.br So 50 can be met with a set of 20 and 30, but cannot be met with a set of 20 and 40.  The nonrecursive requirement is due to the target code base being for codeSQL Server 2000code where the support of recursion is limited.br In addition this is for supporting a multi currency environment where the set of bills available may change think a foreign currency exchange teller for example.p

If I dont set the DataGridView.DataSource  DataTable, I can load 300K rows of data into the DataTable in a few minutes, it really runs fast.  As soon as I add the DataTable to the DataSource it slow to almost a halt instead of a few minutes the same 300K rows can take a 12 hr.  p  pI know that the problem isnt my processing code, it is specific to being bound to the DataGridView.DataSource, and I have timing code to prove this.

Negative 16383 pIve been beating my head against this for awhile to no avail.p  pI have a bunch of images of geological samples which are nominally 1500px wide by 30,000px long.   A typical set of these images will number from 20100.   I have used the DeepZoomTools.dll to create a collection of these images and am attempting to use that to lay out the images.p  pAll the images initially load with a ViewPort.Origin of 0 and a ViewPort.Width of 1  basically the default.   Im iterating over them after the MultiScaleImage.ImageOpenSucceeded event and trying to arrange them based on some additional metadata.    p  pEach image has an associated depth with it depth as in meters, and I would like to stack each image based on that depth.  sometimes there can be a gap between the images, so I have to locate each image based on the top depth value.  See comments for an alternate explanation.p  pAfter I load a set of images I find the pixels per meter for the images themselves like this have to sum them all up as they are not necessarily contiguousp  precodedouble sumImagePixelHeights  from s in imageData.Values select s.Height.Sum double sumImageDepthRanges  from s in imageData.Values select s.BottomDepth  s.TopDepth.Sum actualPixelsPerMeter  sumImagePixelHeights  sumImageDepthRanges codepre  pNow with the pixels of the full size image per meter depths are in units of meters I determine what depth range I actually want to display the y axis is scaled in depthp  precodedouble desiredVisiblePixels  MaxVisibleY  MinVisibleYactualPixelsPerMeter mainImage.ViewportWidth  desiredVisiblePixels  mainImage.ActualHeight codepre  pThis should set the viewport width such that I display the number of original image pixels that the depth range requires, scaling the displayed X range due to aspect ratio lock.p  pI then iterate over the images in the mainImage.SubImages collection to set their origin based on the desired depth.p  precodefor int index  0 index lt mainImage.SubImages.Count index            MultiScaleSubImage si  mainImage.SubImages[index]       ImageMetadata im  imageData[index]       double xpnt  actualPixelsPerMeter im.TopDepth  im.Width       si.ViewportOrigin  new Point0, xpnt        codepre  pThe issue isbr The ViewportWidth calculation is incorrect   my images are scaled in 3x what they should be i.e. a displayed depth range of 10m displays an actual depth range of 3m  p  pI obviously have some bit of logic wrong in my calculations, but after going over it Im just not seeing it.  p  pI am setting the ViewportWidth on the entire multiscale image as opposed to setting it on just the subimages, but that seems to be fine as long as I dont want to adjust the viewport width relative to one another.p  pI have checked the depth values being parsed and passed in and they are correct.p

Negative 16383 pWe have a large MFC application that uses a number of DLLs. So far we have been using vcredistx86.exe to install MFC and the CRT into the unmanaged side by side assembly cache CWindowsWinSxS. When MFCCRT is installed in this way, the application runs on a clean XP machine.p  pAccording to the MSDN documentation, you can install MFCCRT by copying the assembly files into the folder that your application is installed into. I have tested this with a simple MFC application and it works. But I am having problems getting our large MFC application to work using this approach.p  pIt appears that the problem is caused by some of the DLLs having manifests that reference an earlier version of the CRT for example, one DLL contains the following manifest.p  precodeltassembly xmlnsurnschemasmicrosoftcomasm.v1 manifestVersion1.0gt ltdependencygt ltdependentAssemblygt ltassemblyIdentity typewin32 nameMicrosoft.VC80.CRT version8.0.50215.4652 processorArchitecturex86 publicKeyToken1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b gt  ltdependentAssemblygt ltdependencygt ltassemblygt codepre  pWe are copying version 8.0.50727.762 of the CRT assembly to our applications folder. As you can see this is a newer version of the CRT. But for some reason the OS loader fails to load the DLL with the above manifest. This does not happen when the same CRT assembly is installed in WinSxS. When I trace the loading using DependencyWalker I get the error LDR LdrpWalkImportDescriptor failed to probe cdocuments and settingsqatestdesktoptestlog4cpp.dll for its manifest, ntstatus 0xc0150002p  pIt seems that the ability of the loader to load a newer version of an assembly does not work when using private side by side assemblies but it does work when the assemblies are installed into WinSxS.p  pIs there a solution to thisp

Each class Task that inherits the base, could have its own properties that are unique to each class, but at the same time, share the same common base class properties.  For example, the above shows a reboot task and a delete file task, the delete file task needs to know which file to delete, so has a property for that.  But the reboot task does not need this property.  So when the management application is creating these tasks, it shouldnt provide a text box for the file property for the reboot task.  There may be more tasks created at a later date with completely different properties.p  pHow would I go about providing the WinForms management application a way to enumerate each class into a ListView for example, and allowing the user to create these tasks and filling in the dynamic properties that each class would havep  pDesired functionality would be to create a task form that creates dynamic controls available for the properties as needed, depending on the public properties in each class, but at the same time have the base class properties available as well.p  pAny ideas are appreciated.p  pThanks, Scottp

Wouldnt know what to post, as the cart never interacts with the session other than to grab the sessionid. Really Im just wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar. I cant recreate the problem on my local server PHP5, only exists on the live server PHP4.p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 16383 pI know how to validate a field for numeric values, but how can you validate the field if invalid characters have been pasted into the field. Often we have a numeric field, and then an action button, and the numeric field may not fire a blur event when the action button is clicked. How can you force revalidation in this case Do you do it again in the click event of the action button, or there there a more elegant solutionp

Negative 16383 pMy app is about creating surveys. In order to do so, the user should be able to create new fields dynamically.p  pSo, when creating a new survey, an Activity is shown with only 2 buttons add and delete. When a user clicks the add button, a row appears containing a EditTextso he can write the question, a Spinnerthat enables user to select the type of field text, RadioButton, CheckBox, etc.. and another EditText in which the different available answer choices are written, if applicable.p  pTo accomplish this I created a XML file containing these Widgets and each time the user clicks in the add button, the XML is inflated. It works the first time I press the button, but after that... nothing happens.p  pI read somewhere that you cannot inflate the same child 2 times in a parent unless it is done in a loop.p  pSo, my questions arep  p How can I get around this and obtain the desired effectp  p Why doesnt this apply in a Loopp  pAny help or hint is appreciated.

Negative 16383 pI thought Id get this question out there while I noodled on a solution on my own.p  pAfter having built out the bulk of an application, I have a last minute requirement to support readingwriting to an additional database 2 total, no known others.  I built the application using NHibernate, with Autofac supplying the DIIoC components.  FWIW, this resides in an ASP.NET MVC 2 app.p  pI have a generic repository class that takes an NHibernate session.  Theoretically, I can continue to use this generic repository codeIRepositoryltgtcode for the second database so long as the session that gets passed to it is spawned from an appropriate SessionFactory, rightp  pWell, when the app starts, Autofac does its thing.  With regards to the Session and SessionFactory, I have a module that statesp  precodebuilder.Registerc gt c.ResolveltISessionFactorygt.OpenSession     .InstancePerMatchingLifetimeScopeWebLifetime.Request     .OnActivatede gt              e.Context.ResolveltTransactionManagergt.CurrentTransaction  ISessione.Instance.BeginTransaction        builder.Registerc gt ConfigureNHibernate     .SingleInstance codepre  pwhere ConfigureNHibernate, which returns the base SessionFactory, looks likep  precodeprivate ISessionFactory ConfigureNHibernate      Configuration cfg  new Configuration.Configure     cfg.AddAssemblytypeofEntity.Assembly     return cfg.Configure.BuildSessionFactory  codepre  pCurrently, this is limited to just the one database.  In any other NHib scenario, Id likely shove instances of the separate SessionFactories into a hash, and retrieve them as needed.  I dont want to have to rearchitect the whole thing as were fairly close to a major release.  So, Im guessing I need to modify at least the methods above so that I can independently configure two SessionFactories.  My gray area is how Ill go about specifying the correct Factory be used with a specific repository or at least for entities specific to that second database.p  pAnyone have experience with this scenario while using an IoC container and NHibernate in this mannerp  pstrongEDITstrong Ive stubbed out a GetSessionFactory method that takes a configuration file path, checks for the existance of a matching SessionFactory in the HttpRuntime.Cache, creates a new instance if one doesnt already exist, and returns that SessionFactory.  Now I still need to hammer out how to tell Autofac how and when to specify an appropriate config path.

Negative 16383 pIm trying to perform an action periodically. I want to create a new instance of a class after, say, ever 3 seconds.

Negative 16383 pI dont really know if what Im doing is the right way to do it.  Right now it seems to be working until it hits a certain point with a EXCBADACCESS message.p  pIll describe what Im doing as best and with the most relevant details I can tell I have a CalendarViewController that inherits UIViewController which is loading from a .xib file CalendarViewController.xib.  The class contains a UIView called contentView which I created and which I initialize with another nib file based on a class which is also inherited from UIViewControllerp  precode voidviewDidLoad         [super viewDidLoad]        calendarView  [[CalendarView alloc] initWithNibNameCalendarView bundlenil]        [contentView addSubviewcalendarView.view]       codepre  pcalendarView is the class inheriting UIViewController and viewDidLoad is from CalendarViewController.p  pCalendarView.xib has a UITableViewController with its respective UITableView.  This Table View Controller is linked to a CalendarTableController to which I also generated a .xib file for it.p  pEverything is being created just right apparently but it is crashing somewhere very unexpected.  CalendarTableController also implements a DateLoaderDelegate which loads information from an xml on an external url.p  precode voidconnectionDidFinishLoadingNSURLConnection connection       When the data has all finished loading, we set a copy of the      loaded data for us to access. This will allow us to not worry about    whether a load is already in progress when accessing the data.       self.lastLoadedMatchXMLData  [self.matchXMLData copy]     Make sure the delegate object actually has the xmlDidFinishLoading        method, and if it does, call it to notify the delegate that the        data has finished loading.     if [delegate respondsToSelectorselectorxmlDidFinishLoading]              [delegate xmlDidFinishLoading]    codepre  pp  pThe application is getting to this point without any problem.  delegate is containing the correct object a CalendarTableController which implements the DateLoaderDelegate.  But when it arrives to the linep  precode  if [delegate respondsToSelectorselectorxmlDidFinishLoading] codepre  pit crashes with the EXCBADACCESS, I dont really know the reason, if I look at the debugger, the crash is not occurring in any of my classes as any of them are appearing in the execution stack.  URLConnectionClient seems to be generating it, but I dont really know why.  The loading of the xml had worked earlier before I rearranged the ViewControllers to work as I have described now.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 16383 pIm looking into adding a simple Twitter view into my apps, mainly for support and a bit of community.  What would be best practices for integrating Twitter into an app when it strictly serves a supporting role not a starring role  I havent seen other apps do this yet, but Ill humbly assume that Im not the first to try this.p  pMotivation From my perspective, communicating with my customers about support issues, app ideas, and general announcements, is pretty tough.  I tried Ning.com, getsatisfaction.com, email, etc., but they were too disconnected from my app.  Actually, email works fairly well for oneonone support, but not general communications.  Now, some of my apps have their own twitter accounts, which I quite like, but they are still quite disconnected from the app experience.  I would like my users to see, from within the app, recent tweets related to that app and, if the real twitter app is installed, to then go over to the real Twitter app to post their own tweets.  They could see bugworkarounds, use cases, related links, etc.  It would be just awesome.p  pWeaselly followup question What would be a smart implementation approach  MGTwitter seems maybe overkill.  Maybe throwing the twitter html widget into a webviewp

Negative 16383 pI have a little C program thats continuously acquiring a stream of data and sending it via UDP, and in real time, to a different computer. The basic framework for what I originally set out to do has  been laid. In addition, however, Id like to visualize in real time the data thats being acquired. To that end, I was thinking of using Python and its various plotting libraries. My question is how difficult it would be to let Python have access to what is essentially a first in, first out circular buffer of my C program. For concreteness, lets assume there are 1024 samples in this buffer. Does the idea of letting Python have a continuous peek at dynamic C array even sound reasonablepossible If not, what sort of plotting options are best suited to this problemp  pThanks.p

Negative 16383 pIm trying to use the new environment abstraction in our Java EEEJB application. Were already using codeSpringBeanAutowiringInterceptorcode to inject Spring Beans into EJBs by using the standard beanRefContext.xml to bootstrap the shared application context for the Java EE app.p  pNow Ive written a concrete Environment class derived from Spring 3.1 AbstractEnvironment which uses some kind of environment auto detection to select the correct active profile for the machine on which the app is running on. With this feature our app can be delivered with all properties for all environements inside the ear and auto select the correct property set.p  pThe problem is now that org.springframework.beans.factory.access.SingletonBeanFactoryLocator.createDefinitionString, String builds a bean factory group around the beanscontext in beanRefContext.xml using the StandardEnvironment class, and I see no simple way to configure the environment implementation to use here without rewritingoverwriting some part of SingletonBeanFactoryLocator.p  pIs there a simple solution for this, or is s.th. planned in the direction for supporting to specify the Environment implementation with the EJBJava EE integrationp

Negative 16383 pThis question might be a bit sketchy because I do not have the code available at home, but I know this thing otherwise will bug me the whole weekend.p  pWhen I tried to update some code to C11 I began replacing some codestdmapcode with codestdunorderedmapcode. The code only used codestdmapfindcode to access a specific element in the map, so I figured the replacement should be easy. The returned iterator was stored in an codeautocodetyped variable codeauto res  map.find x code, so the typing should check out fine. However when accessing the stored element using coderesgtsecond.dostuffcode I got a compiler error, telling me, that codestruct stdpairltchar, Bgt does not have a member secondcode. Now this really confused me, but unfortunately I did not have time to investigate further.p  pMaybe this is enough information, so someone can give me a hint on this weird compiler error. Or is my understanding that codestdmapcode and codestdunorderedmapcode should have the same interface except for the parts which need an ordering, not correctp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAs promised here some more analysis on the problem. Most likely this will allow someone to help me out better now. As I guessed from the hints in the comments, this was not really caused by the point where I accessed the elements in the map, but by some other part of the code. The reason I found was, that I used the map within Class X to store pointers to other elements of Class X a kind of tree structure. However this seems to work for codestdmapcode but not for codestdunorderedmapcode. Here is some very simple code that exhibits the problemp  precodeinclude ltstdint.hgt include ltunorderedmapgt include ltmapgt  class Test    stdmapltuint32t, Testgt mmap1  Works   stdunorderedmapltuint32t, Testgt mmap  gives error stdpairltT1, T2gtsecond has incomplete type   int main    return 1  codepre  pcodestdmapcode works codestdunorderedmapcode does not work.

Negative 16383 pI have a WPF application and recently I moved it to a class library project so it could be injected into another process.p  pI have succeeded in this and the WPF application loads up correctly and works correctly but some of the controls dont act as they should. My exe version of the project contains exactly the same MainWindow.xaml , but here the controls respond as they should.p  pWhen I say they dont respond properly, I mean that although the controls do work, they often get stuck and I need to move the window. p  pHowever, if I create another project and reference the controls in the class library I dont have any problems loading the window. The problem arises as the code is injected into another process, and Im wondering whether there could be some window focus problem or similar. For example, if I expand my tree view this behavior only happens when using the expand button on the left of the tree view item, anywhere I click afterwards causes the tree view to expand a collapse continuously, until I move the window. p  pI did try to read a bit into how WPF  HWnd works, but I still dont understand this behavior and if anyone could explain it I would be very gratefulp  pEditp  pI am not using a a WPF theme, and the correct version of .Net is targeted 3.5.p

Negative 16383 pIve got a function that slides a div horizontally by manipulating the left value.  Everything works well I can get it to scroll right and left just fine, what Im having problem with is my if statements i believe and stopping it from scrolling.

But it wont stop scrolling even when the left value is far greater than the limits in either direction.

Negative 16383 pIve been recursively refining a UI with visual Studio 2008, and I seem to have lost a control underneath the myriad layers of other controls. the project emisem checked into our version control software I check in after I make a substantial enough change  for instance moving something around on or adding to the UI, or adding a method.p  pThe refining of the UI has come directly from the boss, and he loves to move things around as were discussing any changes that need to be made  which isnt that bad, I suppose. I check in before he starts faffing, and write down everything he does in case we need to recreate it, then if nothing major has changed check the UI out again.p  pI suppose that I should mention that Im using .Net 3.5 because we cant upgrade to VS2010, yet and C, with a few custom controls but most of them are the builtin .NET ones.p  pSomewhere down the line, Ive lost a text box control. Its still listed in the Form properties window, and I can still select it from there. But when I look over at the form, there doesnt seem to be anything highlighted.p  pIve moved most of the controls around where possible, as some of them are docked to sides of the form, or each other. Bad UI design, I know. But thats how the boss wanted it and reordered them send to backfront, and can get all the way back down to the background of the form in most places. But I still cant find it.p  pAt this point, Im inclined to deleteremove the control from the form and start again with it rather than find it and move it into the new position. But, since I cant seem to find it, Im not sure if I can.p  pIs it possible to delete the control in some way other than selecting it and hitting the delete key Id rather not have to jump back to an older version of the UI as Ive made that many small changes, recently and checked in after each one and I have no idea when this text box got lost.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIn case its useful, here are some of the properties of the text box controlp  ul liSize 356, 0li liLocation 1, 1li liMultiline Trueli liText li liDock Fillli ul  pIve added text to the text property, and moved everything again and still cant find it.

Negative 16383 pApologies if something similar has been asked in the future but my search didnt return, what I would consider, directly related. p  pI am trying to implement a service with its backend in AWS EC2S3 and frontend in iPhone and the service is more or less like a todolist. This is not a novel idea but will help me in a class I teach about IT infrastructure. p  pUnfortunately I have access to only my own iPhone and I cannot demonstrate scalability over AWS, etc.p  pemIs there a waysoftware toolframework to simulate virtual users for this app that can send requests to the AWS servers pretending to be from different accountsapps  The simulator should send requests just like my actual iphone app would send if I were to add an item to the list or delete or edit.em p  pI understand stress testing is a well established topic but here I want to just simulate multiple users and demonstrate scalability instead of trying to push the Web service to its limits. Neither am I sure if this completely overlaps with traffic simulation.p  pAny help will be deeply appreciated. p

Negative 16383 pI have two apps between which I want some data exchanged. As they are running in different processes, so, I am using AIDL to communicate between them. Now, everything is happening really great in one direction say my apps are A and B i.e. data is being sent from A to B but, now I need to send some data from B to A.p  pI noticed that we need to include the app with the AIDL in the build path of app where the AIDL method will be called. So in my case A includes B in its build path. For B to be able to send something to A, by that logic, B would need A in its build path. This would create a cycle. p  pI am stuck at this point.

Negative 16383 pIm working on something that when a range filter is active, the range facets will update accordingly. If no filter is given, Im using a default range amp gap. If a filter is set I do a second solr call to recalculate the facet range gap.p  pSo for example at first I show range facets of a gap of 10YEARS. When you filter one of those, it shows 10 range facets of 1YEAR. If you filter again, itll show 12 buckets with a 1 month range etc...p  pIt kind of works, but Im having trouble when the range filter includes a . Solr knows how to correctly filter results when solrfield[19600101T000000Z TO ] is given, but I dont know how I recalculate the date range facet gaps based on . Right now I calculate the difference between the two dates as a unix timestamp and calculate the range gap based on that.p  pAlso, is there a name for what Im trying to do here Id call it variable range gaps, but Im not sure if thats correct.p  pIm not even sure if what Im doing is the best approach. Any advice is welcome.p  pEdit what my question comes down to is I would like to calculate difference as unix timestamp between the highest and lowest date of a field in every solr query.p  pEdit 2 Every solr call I do takes about 300ms on a relatively small index. Thats quite a bit in case I do 2 extra calls with a date sort to find the highest and lowest date value in the query. Then performing the 4th solr call with the correct date gap and fromto values, would get a bit slow.p

Unfortunately, I cant do the same thing to create a view, so I need to find a way to create those aggregates differently that will still allow me to selfjoin on them to keep my totals in order.p    pHere is how Ive retooled my statement so farp  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecodeCreate View QLedger as Select tcum.txnid,         tcum.Item,          tcum.TxnDate,          tcum.[Tran Type],          tcum.Quantity,         tcum.cumq    from select , SUM Quantity               OVER PARTITION BY InventoryLedger.Item              ORDER BY InventoryLedger.TxnID             ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING  cumq,              abs                  sum                      case when [Tran Type]  Shipping                      or [Tran Type]  Customer Return                      then Quantity end                      over partition by qryrptInventoryLedger.item                              order by InventoryLedger.txnid                                      rows unbounded preceding LifeSales             from InventoryLedger tcum   left outer join InventoryLedger tcumnext  on tcum.Item  tcumnext.Item  and tcum.TxnID lt tcumnext.TxnID   and  tcum.cumq  0 and tcumnext.cumq gt0  where tcum.Item  10302  and tcum.cumq  0  group by tcum.TxnID, tcum.TxnDate, tcum.Item, tcum.[tran type], tcum.Quantity codepre  pThis is almost right, except the table Im self joining to tcumnext doesnt have a runningcumulative quantity column to compare to tcum. I cant at all figure out how to make one to compare with. Can anyone help me out Id really appreciate it. Its exciting and frustrating to be so, so close after working on this for so long.p

Negative 16383 pSorry for the long read. This is a part of the book Im confused on.p  blockquote   pThe current trend in coding conventions which Xcode 4 has adopted is   to use an underscore  as the leading character for an instance   variable name. So any references you see in the template code   generated by Xcode to variables starting with a  are referencing the   instance variables directly by name. When you see an synthesize   directive that looks like this p      psynthesize windowwindowp blockquote  pWhy couldnt codewindowcode be declared in proptertysynthesize in the first place instead of assigning it to codewindowcodep  blockquote   pit says to synthesize the getter and setter for the property named   window and to associate that property with an instance variable called   window which does not have to be explicitly declared. This helps to distinguish the use of the instance variable from the property and to   encourage you to set and retrieve the value of the instance variable   through the setter and getter methods. That is, writing something like   thisp      p[window makeKeyAndVisible]  This wont workp      pwill fail, as there is no instance variable named window. Instead, you   have to either name the instance variable directly by its name, such   as p      p[window makeKeyAndVisible] p      por, preferably, use the accessor method p      p[self.window makeKeyAndVisible]p blockquote  pWhy does codeself.windowcode not need the underscore when the other methods dop

Negative 16383 pI am trying to build a custom collection lets call it GenericList, which can hold n collections and act like it was just one.p  pTo inherit all the functions of an ordinary Backbone collection, I set the prototype of GenericList to a new instance of codeBackbone.Collectioncode. Then I overwrite the important ones like codefetchcode, coderesetcode, codeoncode, codeoffcode and so on. Now there are also functions that I want to kick out of GenericList basically add and create.p  pSo in order to delete these functions, I first get my instances prototype which is codeBackbone.Collectioncode and then Backbone.Collections prototype, which simply is an codeObjectcode that holds all the collection functions. When I codedeletecode the functions from there, what happens is, that all instances of Backbone.Collection throughout my app loose these functions, because they all inherit from that one Object.p  pSo my question is, are there other techniques than codedeletecode to hide a function on an object, even if that function is defined anywhere in the objects prototype chainp  pedit links a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netxmDsH2 relnofollowa fiddle... a and a hrefhttpsgithub.comsra448nestedmodelsinbackboneblobmastermodel.generics.js relnofollowthe thing on githubap

Negative 16383 pI am using mobiscroll on a website as a method for date input.

My problem occurs when the user attempts to scroll from December of 2012 to January. You would expect the year to scroll ahead to January of 2013, but it doesnt. Instead, it goes back to the first valid date in the current year. This is not very intuitive.p  pDoes anyone know how to make the scroller behave as expectedp

Negative 16383 pI have a c applicaion that rights event results into workbooks and worksheets.  The windows form in which the event results are entered contains a textbox for each particular result field ie. name, score, time, competitor , etc. and there are about 19 rows of these textboxes that the user can enter the results in.  Many of these textbox fields are autofilled after the user registered the competitors for the event such as name, competitor , address, etc.  My main issue is that there are several races being run under three different categories and I need my application to somehow find the best overal scoretime from every event for each category.  Currently I am out putting the values from the textbox fields on the registration form to an excel spreadsheet using the excel interop and arraylists within for loops.  I am then sorting the values in the Excel spreadsheet by using the range.sort method.  I am having trouble conceptually devising a way in which I can perform what I am trying to accomplish as the events will be on different worksheets.  Does anyone have any suggestions on a course of action I should look into.  I know this is more of a conceptual question on the excel interop, but I really couldnt include code for this as there is way too much involved.  Thanks for any help.p

Negative 16383 pIm developing a participantevent registration web app in php and have come across the following problemp  pWe have multiple events for our techfest in college and have around 4000 participants. At the registration desk, the participants have to be signed up for the eventssinglemultiple.

Then, the admin needs to be able to print out a list of all the people who have signed up for each eventafter LOCKing.p  pWe came up with thisp  ul lihave a BOOLEAN column for each event in the participant tableli lihave a multiple select field as the interface for event inputli liimplode the received arrayli liexplode the result li liset foreach exploded event, set BOOLEAN as 1 against the participantli ul  pso when the admin wants a print, get all participants where BOOLEAN for eventname is set to 1p  pThis looks like a little ugly, and were hoping someone has a better idea to work around this.

Negative 16383 pI have a phonegap 2.2.0  jquery mobile 1.2.0 app that is having a strange issue. p  pI have a page in my app that contains a link to load another page. On the  loaded page I have a back button that, when clicked, takes the user back to the previous page. When I view this interaction within a web browser it works perfectly and no errors are thrown. p  pHowever, when I view it in IOS, the page content and header disappear once the back button transition animation is complete. I see the page show for a flash then it all goes white.  Again, just the page header and content disappear.  I placed an alert in the pageshow event on the page that I am returning to and the page does not go blank until after the alert is closed. p  pTo make things stranger, if I clicktap on the blank area of the page, the content magically shows up again I just dont get it. I tried repainting the page by calling a .page andor a .triggerupdatelayout on the page container, but it seems to do nothing.p  pOnly this page has this issue. All other transitions work fine, even after the blank page thing occurs.  p  pIve not been able to figure this out for many hours now, so any help with this would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 16383 pI found a hrefhttpasktom.oracle.complsasktomfp100110P11QUESTIONID2668391900346844476 relnofollowan Ask Tom articlea explaining that there is not much difference between CHAR and VARCHAR2 in Oracle. It gave the impression that I should use VARCHAR24000 BYTE for every column where I would like to store strings, even for ISO 6391 language codes, because it does not make any difference.p  pI know that it makes sense to use CHAR2 for ISO 6391 language codes to enforce a basic data constraint. But this is not a sufficient constraint, because it permits storing codexycode in the column which is not a valid language code. On the other side I pay for this basic constraint with the limitation that I have to change the database if I want to change my application to use ISO 6392 language codes, which require 3 characters. So I tend to drop the constraint at all from the database level, because it seems to me that the cost is higher than the benefit.p  pWith that in mind, I am wondering if there is any other significant reason why I should not use VARCHAR24000 BYTE for any string shorter than 4000 bytes that I intend to store in an Oracle databasep

Looking at their Git changelog a hrefhttpsgithub.commozillakitsunecommit663d946 relnofollowherea actually shows how they solved that problem, but because I dont understand the steps necessary I am unable to recreate that.  p  pHow do I recalculate the anchor position to make anchor links working again, even with lazy loading enabledp

Negative 16383 pwe are trying to solve a problem related to cluster job scheduler. p  pThe problem is the following we have a set of python scripts which are executed in a cluster, the launching process is currently done by means of the human interaction, I mean to start the test we have a bash script which interact with the cluster to request the resources needed for the execution. What we are intending to do is to build an automatic launching process which should be sound in the sense that it realizes the job status and based on that wait the job ending, restart the execution, etc.... Basically we have to implement a layer between the user workstation and the cluster.p  pAnother additional difficulty is that our layer must be clever enough to interact with the different cluster job schedulers. We wonder if there exists a tool or framework which help us to interact with the cluster without having to deal with each cluster scheduler details. We have searched in the web but we did not find anything suitable for our needs.p  pBy the way the programming language we use is Python.p  pThanks in advancep  pBr.p

Negative 16383 pIve recently started working with this group doing java development. They use maven and svn to manage all of their code and I dont have any real experience with maven so Im trying to play catchup. From what Ive seen, if youre going to modify one of their projects you check it out with svn, then mess with dependencies in pom.xml for 20 minutes, then you can build it using mvn install or whatever. We have an internal repository and all of the projects have a lot of dependencies to code in the repository, so Im pretty much stuck using maven to build every time. Generating an eclipse project from maven isnt working because of the dependencies.p  pWhats really frustrating me is that there doesnt seem to be a good way to run the code or debug it. Maven is producing jar files that can only be executed by maven because the manifest.mf file doesnt have the right path to the main function, etc. Java jar wont work on them.p  pAs far as debugging goes, I spent most of today on google trying to figure out a way to use eclipse to step through my code, but apparently that just cant be done. I was trying to setup kind of remote debugging with the surefire plugin, but you have to write unit tests for that or something which is way overkill for my purposes. In my previous java experience we used svn, ant, and eclipse which was much simpler.p  pAnyway, can somebody with a more experience give me some tips on developing with maven as a build tool Asking my coworkers has been generally unhelpful. I feel like maven is probably a great tool that I just know next to nothing about and I just cant get anything done without being able to stepthrough and debug my code.p

Negative 16383 pI have an MVC3 website using forms authentication.  On the same server is a windows service.p  pBoth share the same database which includes the standard asp.net membership tables and they also share code up to the service layer.p  pI have a need for the windows service to be able to impersonate any membership user and then call a url on the website as that user.  Im not calling the url personally, its called via a component which coverts URL output to a PDF.p  pI dont have the passwords because theyre hashed in the database, so what I need is to be able to get a valid aspxauth cookie and send it with my request.  p  pIve had no joy so far.  Every PDF which is made is just a copy of my login screen.p  pIs it possible to generate a valid ticket from the windows service, which the website will accept and act as if that user had actually been through the login processp  pThanks. p

Negative 16383 pSystem.EventArgs implements a variant of the null object pattern  developers use EventArgs.Empty instead of null to designate a nothing interesting here situation, presumably in order to relieve the consumers of having to deal with possible null reference exceptionsp  pI am declaring my own event with a derived event args class, say codeContosoEventArgscode I think it would be only natural for consumers to be able to pass something like codeContosoEventArgs.Emptycode just codeEventArgs.Emptycode wont work as this would be an attempt to assign an instance of a base class to a variable of the derived class, as they are used to.  This, however, is tricky to implement  the Empty static property doesnt rely on some protected property IsEmpty that I can set in my derived class. If it did, I could do something likep  precodepublic class ContosoEventArgs  EventArgs      public static ContosoEventArgs Empty              get                      return new ContosoEventArgsIsEmptytrue                codepre  pNice and cleanp  pHowever, such a property does not exist and to the best of my knowledge the only way to test EventArgs instance for Emptyness is to compare to EventArgs.Empty. This means that I now need to implement operator  overload... and operator , and Equals..., and GetHashCode... all that boilerplate just to have my specialized event args follow the pattern from the base EventArgsp  pShould I instead just allow nulls I think thats pretty much what they have done in the framework itself  MouseEventArgs and ImageClickEventArgs dont show traces of null object pattern implementationp  pOr am I overlooking some third optionp

Negative 16383 pI am trying to work around a limitation that Filemaker 12 seems to have. In a value list that links to an ODBC attached SQL Server database, it doesnt display every piece of data. If there are 2 people with the same last name for example, it only displays the first person with that last name in the list. This is verified by the following in the Filemaker documentation which I found after a lot of digging p  blockquote   pIf the value list is defined to display information from two fields, items will not be duplicated for the field on which the value list is sorted. For example, if the value list displays information from the Company field and the Name field, and if the values are sorted by the Company field, only one person from each company will appear in the value list.p blockquote  pPortals on the other hand will find all the related data, I just dont understand how do something with the data once I get it in the portal. I essentially thus wish to use a portal AS my dropdown value list, and then to use it as I would have a value list which is then to act as the key to do the rest of the lookups on the page to fill out the invoice.p  pThe major issue here other than this maddening choice Filemaker seems to make is that the external file I am pulling the data from is an ODBC mounted SQL Server file, so I cant do something easy like a calculated field which would give me last name amp   amp first  which would make almost every person unique. Filemaker wont let me do that because it says I cant do that with a field that is not indexed. Any help would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 16383 pIve looked at several posts and other forums to find an answer related to my question, but nothing has come up specific to what I need. As a heads up, Im new to programming and dont possess the basic foundation that most would.p  pI know bash, little python, and decent with RE.p  pIm trying to create a python script, using REs to parse through data and give me an output that I needwant.p  pMy output will consist of 4 values, all originating from one line. The line being read in is thrown together with no defined delimiter. hence the reason for my programp  pIn order to find one of the 4 values, I have to say look for code123code and give me everything after that but stop here codedf5code. The code123code is not constant, but defined by a regular expression that works, same goes for codedf5code. I assigned both REs to a variable. How can I use those variables to find what I want between the two... Please let me know if this makes sense.p

Negative 16383 pIve got a Maven project which uses Javaconfigured Spring codeConfigurationcode etc.. Properties which are referenced by codeValuecode are stored in different places, e.g. Tomcats context.xml.p  pFor testing Ive created a .properties file to provide some values for the components and services. In my JUnit test which uses a spring test context this .properties file is added via codePropertySourcecode. The strongproblemstrong is that the values will not be loaded from the file, instead the value identifier is set as value, e.g. codesomeFlagfalsecode so I get ClassCastExceptions for any other than String. Also the default value will not be set, so I think, the values wont be processed at all.p  pIm sure Spring finds this file because when I change the value of codePropertySourcecode I get some FileNotFoundException. Nevertheless Ive tried different variants to point to this file an all have worked tested by renaming which produced FileNotFoundExceptionp  ul liclasspathtest.properties my preferred notationli litest.propertiesli lifilesrctestresourcestest.propertiesli ul  pIm also sure that Spring itself works, because when I remove the codeValuecode, the class under test is injected via codeAutowiredcode in my test as expected.p  pDown below youll find the problem scenario stripped down as much as possible.

However, instead what happens is that the content view gets set to the size of the codeUIScrollViewcode, as does eminnerViewem, and the codeUIScrollViewcode is not scrollable.p  pWhy am I getting this behaviour which is inconsistent with my previous two test cases, and how can I get working content compression resistance and have the intrinsic content size of my codeUILabelcode respected when Im nesting it in a view within a codeUIScrollViewcode under autolayout I cant see any reason for autolayout to compress my codeUILabelcode in the third case when it is perfectly possible for it to emnotem compress it and still satisfy all constraints in exactly the same way as it did in the first case.p

Thanks in advancep  hr  hr  pUPDATEp  pAfter creating two new server machines, and keeping one that was getting a lot of timeouts, i have the following results  p  precodeFor 100 thread runs over 20 minutes   NEWSERVER1  99 successful connections 1 timeouts NEWSERVER2  94 successful connections 6 timeouts OLDSERVER   57 successful connections 43 timeouts codepre  pOther info    I experienced a JRE crash EXCEPTIONACCESSVIOLATION 0xc0000005 once and had to restart the application.  I noticed that while the app was running my network connection was struggling as i was browsing the internet. I have no idea if this is expected but i think my having at MAX 15 threads is not that much.p  pSo, fisrt of all my old servers had some kind of problem. No idea what that was, since my new servers were created from the same OS image.p  pSecondly, although the timeout percentage has dropped dramatically, i still think it is uncommon to get even one timeout in a small LAN like ours. But this could be a servers application part problem.p  pFinally my point of view is that, apart from the old servers problem i still cannot beleive i lost so much time with that, there must be either a server app bug, or a JDK related bug since i experienced that JRE crash.p  pp.s. I use Eclipse as IDE and my JRE is the latest.p  pIf any of the above ring any bells to you, please comment. Thank you.p  pEDITp  pstrongCould it be that PrintWriter andor BufferedReader are not actually thread safestrongp  pNEW EDIT 09 Sep 2013p  pAfter rereading all the comments and thanks to Gray and his comment  p  blockquote   pWhen you run multiple servers does the first couple work and the rest of them timeout Might be interesting to put a small sleep in your fork loop like 10 or 100ms to see if it works that way.p blockquote  pI rearanged the tree list of the hostsips and got some really strange results. It seems that if an alive host is placed on top of the tree list, thus being first to start a socket connection, has no problem connecting and receiving packets without any delay or timeout. p  pOn the contrary, if an alive host is placed at the bottom of the list, with several dead hosts before it, it just takes too long to connect and with my previous timeout of 10 secs it failed to connect. But after changing the timeout to 60 seconds thanks to EJP i realised that no timeouts are occuringp  pIt just takes too long to connect more than 20 seconds in some occasions. Something is blobking new socket connections, and it isnt that the hosts or network is to busy to respond.p  pI have some debug data here, if you would like to take a look   a hrefhttppastebin.com2m8jDwKL relnofollowhttppastebin.com2m8jDwKLap

I understand a patch to be a diff that can be applied to source to build a new binary with a fix included. It seems like that is mostly handled using automated tools these days.p
Negative 16383 pIm using the history.js plugin a hrefhttpsgithub.combrowserstatehistory.js relnofollowhttpsgithub.combrowserstatehistory.jsa to give elements on a page a certain unique url when opened.p  pAs expected, this works great in HTML5 browsers, but the plugin isnt quite doing what I need in HTML4 browsers Internet Explorer, in other words.p  pBasically, Im having the same pitfall that is outlined in the documentation for the plugin, as seen herep  blockquote   pThese issues are unavoidable if hashes are used.p      pURLs get polluted if we did not start on the home pagep      ul   lipa hrefhttpwww.facebook.combaluptonbaluptonskinfo relnofollowhttpwww.facebook.combaluptonbaluptonskinfoapli   lipa hrefhttpmywebsite.compage1page2 relnofollowhttpmywebsite.compage1page2apli   ul blockquote  pAlthough, my URLs are not quite as bad as this, other than the hash being thrown in, the url is usable. Removing the suid at the end would also be nice, as it isnt necessary in my case, but it should be fine if thats not possible.p  pHere is what my URL needs to look likep  pa hrefhttpdomain.comsitenamemainitem109 relnofollowhttpdomain.comsitenamemainitem109ap  pAnd this is the result in IEp  pa hrefhttpdomain.comsitenamemainidea109ampsuid13812466306670658 relnofollowhttpdomain.comsitenamemainidea109ampsuid13812466306670658a...p  pAs far as I could gather from the documentation was that my only option would be to disable the HTML4 fallback, which means that nothing will happen in IE.p  pIm wondering if theres a way to just forgo the HTML4 fallback options, but emstill useem the HTML5 solution in its place to change the url in the same way it does, just with a different method.. I know that the method used for the HTML5 solution wont work. Or, if theres any other way to alter the way that the HTML4 solution is implemented, to bend it to the needs of this projectp  pstrongUPDATEstrong In my own research, I am seeming to find that it is impossible to alter an HTML4 compliant browsers url without using a hash. Im currently in the process of integrating some workarounds into my project so that our URLs use hashes. Im still leaving this question open as this isnt really an answer, and I dont even know if I am 100 right.p

Thank you very much. p  pUPDATE Thank you for all replies... Would another solution that would deal with the cache issue be to have 1 external php file that load all the other css into it  sort of combining all into 1 Does that make sense p
Negative 16383 pIf there is a better way to go about this which is quite likely, please let me know how to go about it.p  pIm working on some code that is supposed to dynamically set the form variables as regular variables so that we can be lazy and not have to refer to the variable with form.somevariable name.p  pThat part works perfectly.  Until I start testing for URL conflicts in which a URL variable has the same name.  For instance. . .p  pI have a form that passes two variables FirstName and LastName.  If I hit the page, the form shows up, I input a first and last name and click submit.  The code works perfectly.p  pHowever, if I have URL variables with the same names, the code reports the url variable values instead of the form values.p  pSome sample valuesp  purl.FirstName  Joep  purl.LastName  Blackp  pform.FirstName  Stevep  pform.LastName  Whitep  pMy code that exposes the form variable will correctly find the form field names, but then when I evaluate the value of the given form field, it will return the value of the URL variable of the same name rather than the form variable.p  pWhat I am really wanting as I described briefly up above is to have code that automatically converts client, URL and Form variables into regular variables so that you dont have to write lots of extra code grabbing them later on.  Frameworks like CFWHEELS and ColdBox do this by default, but at the company I work out, we arent using any of them.  I need it to expose the URL variables, but give presidence to form variables if they have the same name, because they are likely to be intended to do an update or such.p  pThe code follows  Feel free to ignore the code for the URL and client variables if you wish as they dont directly affect how the form code works, I have tested with them commented out and I get the same result.  I provided all of it to give a more complete idea of what I have been toying with so far.  Please note that I dont normally use evaluate.  There is probably a better way to go, but I dont know what it is.p  p p  pp          First Name       Last Name             pp  pp  pp  pbr p  pURL variablesp  pp  precodeltcfloop indexi listparamsurlgt      ltcfset myDynVar  Evaluateigt        lt Lets output the dynamically created variable as a test gt      i  myDynVarltbr gt  ltcfloopgt codepre  pp  pp  pp  precodeltcfoutputgt      ltbgtField Namesltbgt Form.FieldNames      ltpgt          ltbgtField Valuesltbgtltbrgt          ltcfloop INDEXTheField listForm.FieldNamesgt              TheField  EvaluateTheFieldltbrgt              ltcfset TheField  EvaluateTheFieldgt          ltcfloopgt      ltpgt      Lets try and output the two form fields without using the form. notationltbrgt      FirstName  FirstName ltbr gt      LastName  LastName  ltcfoutputgt codepre  pp  pbr p  pThe client variables currently available arebr p  pp  precodeltcfset nVarCounter  1gt  ltcfloop listGetClientVariablesList indexwhichClientVargt      whichClientVar  client[whichClientVar]ltbr gt      ltcfset whichClientVar  EvaluatewhichClientVargt  ltcfloopgt codepre  pp

Negative 16383 pI seem to get the above error every so often in an insert heavy part of my code.  I know normally this means there is an open Cursor within the connection but I have been through checking all my cursors are in try finally blocks and closed. Also in logcat the error reads sqlite3close... failed 5 which I think means the database is busyp  pThe error can be ignored if I add the following code to my finally block where the database connection is closed.p  precode  finally        writer.endTransaction     boolean successAtClose  false     whilesuccessAtClose  false            try                writer.close         successAtClose  true              catchException e                e.printStackTrace                 dbConn.releaseLock    codepre  pWhen stepping through the code above the e.printStackTrace is hit once but on the second attempt the writer.close does not throw an error.p  pJust to reiterate, this problem doesnt even happen every time the code block runs, the same data can be inserted say 56 times and only throw the error on one of these times.  In addition the error does not reoccur straight away after happening once but continues to popup at random intervals.p  pDoes anyone know why this might occur Or a better way to recover from this than the finally code above Since it will take me a long time to add this to all my database code.p  pADDEDp  pDatabase is opened with a custom codeSQLiteOpenHelpercode which is extended to use a reentrant lock to ensure only one thread accesses the database at any one time.

The proper url is codeassetsadminarrow.pngcode.p  pThere are probably two possible solutions right nowp  ol liMove all codeadminappassetsadminimagescode to codeadminappassetsimagescode, orli liprefix all image names in codeimagepathcode method with engine name which gives me codeimagepathadminarrow.pngcode.li ol  pAre there any other, better, ways to handle this thingp

Negative 16383 pSo looks like I already got 2 downvotes for this thread. This thread can help people with poor understanding on Joomla or other PHP driven CMS as it helped me. p  pThe issue I had, which had been solved by Gadoma in this thread, was I couldnt output any HTML contents using HTML Module in Joomla since it was automatically adding quotes and slashes while I tried to update links and images in the anchor tags and img tags.  This was happening to me because phps Magic Quote was turned on for some reasons.p  pWho actually faces this type of problembr p  pIn short, people with share hosting and PHP or CMS driven websites actually face this kind of weird issue as they dont have access to the root of their server to modify the .htaccess and php.ini file in order to disable magic quote. p  pWhat type of solutions I wanted to get And whyp  pI tried almost all the solutions found in the web including this site. Im not sure why it didnt work for me although some people had positive reply to the solutions.  But as I got tired of searching ways to disable the Magic Quote, I wanted to know if there were any way to serve the purpose manually. Gadoma gave the exact solution I was looking for. p  pAnd what was the solution p  pIf everything fails and youre not a server configuration expert like me, you should be benefited with this thread.  Just check out the solution that Gadoma provided and this issue should go away.

Negative 16383 pSo I am making an application with custom menus. I have two types of classes for this, the MenuContainer class, and MenuOption class. The MenuContainer decides the size, location and align of the menu, and the MenuOption decides string to be show, font, color and so on. I also wanted to add a piece of code to each MenuOption, the code decides what is to happen when the MenuOption is clicked. So each MenuOption has its own unique code that is set when creating a new MenuOption. How do I do this I am hoping something like this may workp  precodeMenuOption option1  new MenuOptionOption1,font,color       public void run           code to be executed          option1.run  running the code codepre  pI dont know if this is asked often, but I searched and found nothing. p

Negative 16383 pLately Ive been getting more and more interested in Meteor.js. At the moment Im developing a new web project of mine. What I cant get out of my mind is the Autopublish feature of Meteor. At the moment of writing my MongoDB has a total of 32453 records, therefore, as you can probably guess I had to turn off autopublish and subscribepublish manually. p  pIve read a mouthful of guides now and it seems to be a completely common practice to turn off autopublish as soon as your application is created. This makes me question  does the feature have any practical use in a real world scenario I can see it being useful for the shock and awe effect of the examples, but aside from that, it seems more or less pointless. I might be missing something very obvious though.p

Negative 16383 pIm trying to incorporate search functionality into one of my applications and Im having problems solving an issue with multiple SearchViews being displayed.br So, when I click the search icon in my actionbar I get a search view that occupies the entire actionbar and there is also another search view that is either hiding below the top view or it is rendered after the top view is destroyed, Im not sure which as I havent been able to track it down. The SearchView that is rendered on the bottomsecond is the actual view that I want.   The top view functions correctly when I make a search request, but when I navigate back to the activity that made the search call, the original SearchView is gone and the correct SearchView is now in place.  It then functions normally until I closecollapse the SearchView. The original SearchView can also be closed by a touchEvent anywhere on the screen and the correct SearchView is up and waiting for input.p  pAny ideas on what is causing this p  pBar before touching

Negative 16383 pMy app is basically is a schedule app, where Id like to show notifications x minutes before an userset event occurs.br I read the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsuinotifiersnotifications.html relnofollowdocumentationa, but it only covers showing a notification at the time the notification code is being executed which I guess is the only way.  p  pMy guess is that if I want to have notifications show up even when my app is closed, I need to somehow make the app run in the background and constantly check for upcoming events, calculate the time left, and show a notification when the time left equals the time before the event the user chose to be notified at.p  pI read this question answers a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13741875howtogetandroidnotificationswhenappwasclosedHow to get android notifications when app was closeda.p  pThere is a pretty detailed answer using services I could simply implement, but the other answer claims this approach is crappy.br The second answer also suggest the usage of codeAlarmManagercode which, after reading the doc, doesnt sound that bad executing code at a specific time.br However, since Im targeting API19 its inexact according to the doc.p  pSo what exactly strongisstrong the most efficient and the right way to do this p
Negative 16383 pWe have a v1 version 1 of a application on Google Play and a v2 in which we have changed the apps launch icon. To test the change, we download v1 from Play and then we install v2 over it. When we install v1, a shortcut of the app is created in the phones home screen. This is due to the fact that the AutoAdd widgets option is checked in the Google Plays Settings.  The problem appears when we install v2 over v1. At the update, the v2s icon is correctly updated in the menuthe new icon is displayed, but the shortcut in the home screen has the old icon.p  pThis problem doesnt appear if the user installs v1 of the app, creates the shortcut on the home screen and then updates to v2, so my guess is that the cause is related to the fact that the shortcut is automatically created through code or through the AutoAdd widgets. p  pMy question is what can be done to prevent the shortcut of being created on the home screen codewise. I know there is code for creating shortcuts, but is there code for preventing themp  pThank you.   p

Negative 16383 pIm trying to use Audio Queue Services to play mp3 audio that is being delivered from an external process. I am using NSTask and NSOutputHandle to get the output from the command  that part works fine. Im using Audio File Stream Services to parse the data from the command  that seems to work as well. In my Audio File Stream Services Listener function, Im not sure what to do with the packets that come in. It would be great if I could just throw them at the audio queue but apparently it doesnt work that way. Youre supposed to define a series of buffers and enqueue them on the audio queue. Can the buffers correspond to the packets or do I have to somehow convert them Im not very good at C or pointer math so the idea of converting arbitrarysized packets to nonmatchingsized buffers it kind of scary to me. Ive read the Apple docs many times but it only covers reading from a file, which seems to skip this whole packetbuffer conversion step.p

But, a resultant string is around 30 extra in size 4010 bytes of data was encoded into 5348 bytes, which while insignificant for a single binary chunk, is seen as a concern by my client when it comes to embedding a lot of such binary chunks in a JSON response. Due to the extra size, response would take more time to reach the client, which is a crucial concern for my clients application.p  pAnother option I considered was to stream the binary chunks as codeoctetstream ContentTypecode to the client. But I am not sure if its any better than the above solution. Futhermore, I havent been able to figure out how to relate the binary chunks and their names in such a situation.p  pIs there a solution better than convert binary to text and embed into JSONp

I want to use a real MYSQL database as that is what I will be using in production and I have read that there are quite a few differences between MYSQL and the InMemory database provided by Play.p  pIn posts such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14750375howtocreateunittestsagainstnoninmemorydatabasesuchasmysqlinplayfrthis onea and a hrefhttpblog.matthieuguillermin.fr201203unittestingtricksforplay20andebean relnofollowthis blog about testing Play applicationsa, the posts show examples that initialise a emFakeApplicationem object with database parameters and then call emHelper.startfakeAppem.p  pThe a hrefhttpwww.playframework.comdocumentation2.0.2apijavaindex.htmlplaydbebeanModel.Finder.html relnofollowdocsa for emHelper.startFakeApplication appem gives the following descriptionp  blockquote   pStarts a new application.p blockquote  pOK great. But what processes are actually triggered off by calling start and what will that give me in a testp  precodeMapltString, Stringgt settings  new HashMapltString, Stringgt settings.putdb.default.url, jdbcmysqllocalhosttestdb settings.putdb.default.user, root settings.putdb.default.password,   app  Helpers.fakeApplicationsettings Helpers.startapp codepre  pI was hoping that the above code would configure Ebean to use my test database, but when I try to execute a method such as emEbean.saveem I get an error saying that no default database has been registered with Ebean. In order to register I will need to populate a emServerConfigem object and create an emEbeanServerem from the emEbeanServerFactoryem. In that case was there any point in passing the settings map to the emFakeApplicationem object And again, just what does starting a emFakeApplicationem actually do How can it be usedp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 16383 pIm attempting to use two SWF files to render, animate, and control the overlays for a video stream being produced in Open Broadcaster. The control panel SWF sits outside the application in a standalone projector, and the rendering .swf is placed inside the stream by adding it as the source media file for a plugin that uses CEF3 to create a browser window. p  pWhen these two files are in standalone media players, they communicate fine, however the setup described above is preventing this functionality from working properly. I know that both .swf files have all domains and insecure domains allowed, the CEF plugin is using the NPAPI Flash 12.0.0 player instead of the PPAPI pepper player which has additional security restrictions directly blocking LocalConnection, and Im even able to socket with the rendering .swf and receive data through Monster Debugger. However, Im at a loss as to how to step through what is preventing LocalConnection from communicating.p  pAll of the guides and information Ive found on this issue in regards to Chromium have been specifically about getting around the PPAPI restrictions, and state that the NPAPI should work fine. However, Im concerned that the two layers of hosting The CEF browser window and the Open Broadcaster app itself is just not a scenario where this methodology is possible. p

Negative 16383 pIve seen in some Microsoft WP apps where they display text in the system tray along with the time, and then when the user taps the system tray the text disappears and the normal system tray data signal, power, etc comes down and is displayed.

Id like to be able to implement the same feature in an app I am creating, where the user always sees some sort of system tray data, such as time with the name of the app, or the full system tray display that can normally be viewed.

Negative 16383 pThis is not a how does it work but why is it this way  what am I missing questionp  pI think Ive gotten the hang of the javascript Promise construct  very clever, simple and nice.

The concept was simple enough, but the examples like above confused me greatly, and I figured out it was this difference that got me  it seems inconsistent to me. Is there any reason why the standard isnt more along the lines ofp  precodeModification to the standard Promise.to  functionaction     return new Promisefunctionresolve, reject         resolvetrue     .thenaction   Would result in a new Promise being constructed  used like this var somepromise  Promise.tofunction     if somecondition          return It works      else          throw ErrorNoooooo      .then     functionmessage         console.logI was told message      .catch     functionerr          console.logDang, it broke       codepre  pI dont do this, because I think its a bad idea to modify the base classes in javascript, but the example above seems to be working.p  pWhat would be lost if the standard worked this way I guess something, but what am I not getting It seems to be simpler to grasp, when getting aquainted with this concept and its less verbose.p

Negative 16383 pI have four buttons on a single web page and I want them to be linked or grouped in the following manner. Their text is in white color. When I click on any one button, its text becomes red. Now, if i click on another button, its text also becomes red but I want the first buttons text to go back to being white. In this manner, I want all four buttons to be grouped such that pressing any button makes its text red and turns the previously selected buttons text back to white. Kind of like preset buttons on an old radio. How to go about this grouping in jQuery p  pI do have each button doing something else too which is unique per button like what label is displayed at the top of the web page, so Id like to preserve that functionality when doing this color grouping. One of the buttons displays a label Add at the top of the web page, whereas another of the four buttons might change that label to Edit. Id like to keep this functionality but group just the color functionality if that makes sense.p  pThis kind of jQuery is still beyond my skill level at this point hence I seek advice. Thanks.p

Negative 16383 pHow do you copy a folder and its contents in Windows Store Appsp  pIm writing tests for a Windows Store App. The app does things with files, so a set of known files is needed.

Negative 16383 pI would like to setup a reverse proxy in IIS but in my configuration I get problems with ASP.NET postbacks. When you click on any submit button of the proxied website then you get a 404 error. The URL in browser address bar is changed to the rewritten URL.p  pFor example, the website that I need to proxy is a hrefhttpwebsite.comhost relnofollowhttpwebsite.comhosta. Here a hrefhttpwebsite.com relnofollowhttpwebsite.coma and a hrefhttpwebsite.comhost relnofollowhttpwebsite.comhosta are separate web applications. Host is running as a virtual folder under website.com. p  pI want to access the Host from this URL a hrefhttpme.localmyhost relnofollowhttpme.localmyhosta. In IIS me.local is an asp.net web application and Myhost is added as another application as child of me.local. Everything works just fine as long as you dont click on submit button anywhere on the proxied website. Once you do this then you get to page a hrefhttpme.localhost relnofollowhttpme.localhosta which results in 404 error. When you look at pages html source then forms action url is set correctly to myhostp  pWhy does the error happen Is it possible to fix it in IIS, or do we need to make changes to the host applicationp  pMy server is running IIS 8.5. The host server is an old one with IIS 6, and web application can be asp.net 1.1 or asp.net 2.0.p  pThe section with rewrite rules from web.config of myhost application isp  precodeltconfigurationgt     ltsystem.webServergt         ltrewritegt             ltrulesgt                  ltrule nameRoute the requests for host stopProcessingtruegt                      ltmatch url. gt                      ltconditionsgt                          ltadd inputCACHEURL patternhttps gt                      ltconditionsgt                      ltaction typeRewrite urlC1website.comhostR1 gt                      ltserverVariablesgt                          ltset nameHTTPACCEPTENCODING value gt                      ltserverVariablesgt                  ltrulegt                 ltrule namehostToDefault stopProcessingtruegt                     ltmatch url gt                     ltconditionsgt                         ltadd inputREQUESTMETHOD patternPOST negatetrue gt                     ltconditionsgt                     ltaction typeRedirect urldefault.aspx appendQueryStringfalse gt                 ltrulegt                 ltrule nameRedirectUserFriendlyURL1 stopProcessingtruegt                     ltmatch url.default.aspx gt                     ltconditionsgt                         ltadd inputREQUESTMETHOD patternPOST negatetrue gt                     ltconditionsgt                     ltaction typeRedirect url. appendQueryStringfalse gt                 ltrulegt             ltrulesgt              ltoutboundRulesgt                  ltrule nameReverseProxyOutboundRule1 preConditionResponseIsHtml1gt                      ltmatch filterByTagsA, Area, Base, Form, Frame, Head, IFrame, Img, Input, Link, Script patternhttpswebsite.com. gt                      ltaction typeRewrite valueR2 gt                  ltrulegt                  ltrule nameNonhostRewriteRelativePaths preConditionResponseIsHtml1gt                      ltmatch filterByTagsA, Area, Base, Form, Frame, Head, IFrame, Img, Input, Link, Script patternhost. negatefalse gt                      ltaction typeRewrite valuehttpwebsite.comR1 gt                  ltrulegt                  ltrule namehostRelativePaths preConditionResponseIsHtml1gt                      ltmatch filterByTagsA, Area, Base, Form, Frame, Head, IFrame, Img, Input, Link, Script patternhost. negatefalse gt                      ltaction typeRewrite valuemyhostR1 gt                  ltrulegt                 ltrule nameOutboundRewriteUserFriendlyURL1 preConditionResponseIsHtml1gt                     ltmatch filterByTagsA, Form, Img pattern.myhostdefault.aspx gt                     ltaction typeRewrite valueR1myhostdefault gt                 ltrulegt                                  ltpreConditionsgt                      ltpreCondition nameResponseIsHtml1gt                          ltadd inputRESPONSECONTENTTYPE patterntexthtml gt                      ltpreConditiongt                  ltpreConditionsgt              ltoutboundRulesgt         ltrewritegt         lturlCompression doStaticCompressionfalse doDynamicCompressionfalse gt     ltsystem.webServergt ltconfigurationgt codepre

If Manager finds content OK he sends this to next level approver We call it Publisher to publish via workflow. Though if manager rejects the content , Author gets a message in his inbox. Now, if Publisher finds the content good he simply publish the content. If he finds any issue  he rejects the content and Author gets a message in his CQ5  Thats how it has been configuredp  pNow we want to send a message to author when the Publisher publishes the content Technically when the workflow ends. Right now the author only gets the message once content is rejected. Can anybody help us on this p  pPS We dont want to go with email notifications because of some reasons.

The gist of the puzzle is as followsp  blockquote   pHow long a chain of overlapping movie titles, like Sling Blade   Runner, can you findp      pUse the following listing of movie titles a hrefhttpsgithub.comchristopherperryslingbladerunnerblobmastersrcmainresourcesMOVIES.TXT relnofollowMOVIES.TXTa. Multiword   overlaps, as in License to Kill a Mockingbird, are allowed. The same   title may not be used more than once in a solution. Heuristic   solutions that may not always produce the greatest number of titles   will be accepted seek a reasonable tradeoff of efficiency and   optimality.p      pThe file a hrefhttpsgithub.comchristopherperryslingbladerunnerblobmastersrcmainresourcesMOVIES.TXT relnofollowMOVIES.TXTa contains 6561 movie titles in alphabetical   order.p blockquote  pMy attempt at a solution has several parts.p  h2Graph Constructionh2  pWhat I did was map every movie title to every other movie title it could chain to on its right. What I end up with as my graph is a codeMap[String, List[String]]code. You can see the graph that was built using this process a hrefhttpsgithub.comchristopherperryslingbladerunnerblobmastergraph.txt relnofollowherea.p  h2Graph Traversalh2  pI did a Depth First Search using every node every key in the map as a starting node of the search. I kept track of the depth at which each node was visited during the search, and this was tagged in the nodes returned by the DFS. What I ended up with was a codeList[List[Node]]code where every codeList[Node]code in the List was the DFS tree from a particular search.p  h2Finding the longest chainh2  pI took the results of all the graph traversals in the previous step, and for every codeList[Node]code I sorted the list by the depth values I tagged the nodes with previously, in descending order. Then starting with the head of the list which gives me the deepest node visited in the DFS I backtrack through the nodes to build a chain. This gave me a codeList[List[String]]code where every codeList[String]code in the List was the longest chain for that particular DFS. Sorting the codeList[List[String]]code by the size of each codeList[String]code and grabbing the head then gave me the largest chain.p  h2Resultsh2  pThe longest chain found with my algorithm was 217 titles long. The output can be viewed a hrefhttpsgithub.comchristopherperryslingbladerunnerblobmasterlongestchain.txt relnofollowherea. p  pIve only been able to find a few other attempts by Googling, and it seems every other attempt has produced longer chains than what I was able to accomplish. For example a hrefhttpcommentsarelies.blogspot.com200805slingbladerunner.html relnofollowthis posta states that Eric Burke found a chain 245 titles long, and a hrefhttpwww.reddit.comcomments2r7qwiftheintegersfrom1to999999999arewrittenc03rq5c relnofollowa user by the name of icefox on Reddita found a chain that was 312 titles long.p  pI cant think of where my algorithm is failing to find the longest chain, given other people have found longer chains.

Negative 16383 pIm creating a Django app, where users can create accounts for them and then add transactions to each account. Its part of a site that will allow users to track investment gains.

Negative 16383 pI have created a multiflavor .aar file on my machine I wrote the source for the .aar and have it stored on my machine.p  pTo test the .aar code Im writing a test application that imports the .aar.p  pAfter importing the .aar there is an indicator in Android Studio that I can attach sources. I follow the instructions and point Android Studio to the source folders. However, it does not attach the source.p  pWhen I used to have a simpler .aar file without flavors I was able to attach sources just fine. When I switched to a multiflavor project it seems that Android Studio cannot find the sources.p  pMy ultimate goal is to be able to use the debugger while my test app is running to debug the .aar code. So Im either looking for a solution to attach the sources, or some way to set breakpoints in the code of the .aar and have the test application break at those points.p  pDoes anyone know how to solve this problemp

Negative 16383 pI am making a game in which there is a player and multiple enemies at least, thats important for now. I have and NSTimer that calls a method that calles the Enemy class that spawns an enemy every x amount of time. The method calls the spawn method in side the Enemy class which returns a SKSpriteNode that gets spawned in the GameScene. p  pNow, whenever the Enemy is falling from the sky which is what it does it spawns on top and then falls down, Its name is fallingEnemy and whenever it hits the ground this name gets updated to staticEnemy I do this using contact bit masks What I want to happen is the following Whenever the enemy hasnt hit the ground yet and hits the player before it hits the ground, I want it to kill the player and when the enemy has already hit the ground and the player touches it, I want the player to die.p  pI do this by checking with an If statement if the name of the enemy is fallingEnemy whenever the player contacts the enemy. The problem lies here In my GameScene I have a property call aNewEnemy SKSpriteNode and it gets set equal to the SKSpriteNode that the Enemy class returns every time it is called by the NSTimer. Then when the enemy hits the ground the name changes to staticEnemy for a while until a new enemy spawns, because then the name gets set back to fallingEnemy. I completely understand why this is happening, because it is very obvious, but I just dont no another way to do it. Anyone got any suggestions There probably is a much easier way to do this that Im not familiar with.p  pThanks p  pEDITp  pI posted the code herep  precodevoidcreateSceneContents      self.spawningSpeed  2.5 self.enemySpawnTimer  [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeIntervalself.spawningSpeed                                                         targetself                                                       selectorselectorspawnObject                                                       userInfonil                                                        repeatsYES]  codepre  pThere are more things in the createSceneContents method but those arent important now.p  precodevoidspawnObject  if self.isPaused  NO           self.enemyData  [[Enemy alloc]init]      self.aNewEnemy  [self.enemyData createEnemyWithSizeself.playerSize andWidthself.frame.size.width andHeightself.frame.size.height  self.player.position.y]         self.aNewEnemy.physicsBody.allowsRotation  NO         self.aNewEnemy.physicsBody.categoryBitMask  self.enemyCategory         self.aNewEnemy.physicsBody.contactTestBitMask  self.enemyCategory  self.playerCategory  self.edgeCategory  self.bottomCategory         [self.world addChildself.aNewEnemy]      self.playerScore  10     NSString score  [NSString stringWithFormati, self.playerScore]     self.actualScore.text  score     codepre  pIn Enemy.m p  precodeSKSpriteNode createEnemyWithSizefloatsize andWidthfloatwidth andHeightfloatheight      self.enemy  [SKSpriteNode spriteNodeWithImageNamedblock.png]     self.enemy.size  CGSizeMakesize  5, size  5      self.enemy.name  fallingEnemy     self.enemy.physicsBody  [SKPhysicsBody bodyWithRectangleOfSizeCGSizeMakesize  1, size  1]     self.enemy.physicsBody.restitution  0     int randomSection  arc4randomuniform7     switch randomSection      case 0          self.enemy.position  CGPointMake2.5  self.enemy.size.width2, height5          break     case 1           self.enemy.position  CGPointMakewidth7  self.enemy.size.width2, height5          break     case 2          self.enemy.position  CGPointMakewidth72   self.enemy.size.width2, height5          break     case 3          self.enemy.position  CGPointMakewidth73   self.enemy.size.width2, height5          break     case 4          self.enemy.position  CGPointMakewidth74   self.enemy.size.width2, height5          break     case 5          self.enemy.position  CGPointMakewidth75   self.enemy.size.width2, height5          break     case 6          self.enemy.position  CGPointMakewidth76   self.enemy.size.width2, height5           break     default          break    return self.enemy  codepre  pThis gets called in the didBeginContact when the enemy touches the ground or another enemyp  precodevoidchangeState      self.enemy.physicsBody.dynamic  NO    self.isFalling  NO    self.enemy.name  staticEnemy   codepre  pNow how do I keep track of individual enemies in the GameScenep

Negative 16383 pMy main application opens an user page. There are New  Edit  Delete buttons on the same page.p  pI am using Datatables Editor to display records. When I click on New button an lightbox opens up and the datatables editor buildin plugin shows add user template. When this template is submitted a new record is created. The backend has a AUTOINCREMENT key which I want to be passed back to main page such that I display a message User ID  XXXXX has been createdp  pThe issue is that even though I pass it as a session variable the main page which I believe since it is already loaded and cannot be refreshed after lightbox page is submitted  it never receives the updated session variable.

Negative 16383 pSo, I have a bit of a philosophical question in the realm of C11 coding best practices.p  pWhen creating an application which essentially transforms data from one system to another.   Should you define everything in classes, or use structs within a classp  pHere is a more concrete example of what I am referring to.   p  pFor a typical class object.   Should I create it this wayp  precodeclass Contact      stdstring Name     stdstring Address                        void Load     void Save     stdstring OtherFunctions stdstring Name   codepre  pOr is it better to separate out the data from the classp  precodestruct ContactInfo      stdstring Name     stdstring Address                      class Contact      ContactInfo data     void Load     void Save     stdstring OtherFunctions stdstring Name   codepre  pSeveral reason that I am contemplating the Struct over just doing in a class is the ability to transfer data between APIs.    For example, the creation of these objects is done at a low level pure C application.   But, at some point through the process, it is exposed to a managed C application and then finally consumed in a .NET application.p  pSecondly, as information is passed around from function to function, I am passing only the information and not the class object.   With modern compilers, perhaps this point is mute, but logically to me, it seems better to pass data only than objects.p  pThirdly, it separates class members needed to manage the object data from the data itself.   So having a members like ErrorCode, ErrorMessage, etc, dont pollute what is considered data and what is not.p  pAm I off base here Is there a better way that I should be doing this type of activityp

Negative 16383 pI am writing a 2D lighting system using LibGDX, but I have run into difficulties with shaders.p  pPreviously I had written a lighting system in Slick2D, which worked very well, however the way coordinates worked in shaders in that library seems to be very different to LibGDX.p  pI had to write this Java function to change coordinates from world coordinates to whatever works in shaders. I did this by analysing the output for different coordinates.p  precodepublic static Vector2 screenToNDCVector2 screenCoords, Vector2 textureSize, Vector2 texturePosition  return screenCoords.sclnew Vector21f  textureSize.x, 1f  textureSize.y.subtexturePosition.sclnew Vector21f  textureSize.x, 1f  textureSize.y  codepre  pThis function works fine translating the light position. This is my shader codep  precodeifdef GLES precision mediump float endif  varying vec4 vcolor varying vec2 vtexCoords uniform sampler2D utexture uniform mat4 uprojTrans  uniform vec2 lightPos uniform vec3 lightCol  uniform float lightIntensity  float distvec2 a, vec2 b      return sqrtb.x  a.x  b.x  a.x  b.y  a.y  b.y  a.y   void main      glFragColor  vec4lightCol, 1.0  distvtexCoords, lightPos  codepre  pCurrently, this will draw only the light colour, with full alpha. Upon investigation, I found this must be because the codedistcode function is returning very small values such that code1.0  distcode is positive. If I multiply codedistvtexCoords, lightPoscode by a value like 10, the light falloff works as intended.p  pIs there any way to simply make coordinates work in LibGDX shaders in the same way that they do in Java or Slick2D shadersp  pThanks, Jackp

Also, refresh if a action is done, such as if a button is pressed.p  pFor example, in my app I am displaying a text when a user comes near a river, however because the map does not refresh the message is not shown to the user unless there come near a river and close and reopen the app.p  pe.g. when user comes near one of the lat and long, it will say You are near a River recorded in our database, this river is marked as 1.p

Negative 16383 pIm making a game. It seems most natural to put almost all the game logic in the codeGamecode class, have it create all the objects and have mostly getters and setter methods in them. Is this actually wrong Should I try to force some of the game logic into the other classes like the process of codePlayercode taking his turn as a method of codePlayercodep  pIn a typical game, if a player shooting is triggered by a mouse click, how would you go from the click event to updating the screen state to destroying the target object in terms of where the methods would be located and objects calling each otherp  pShould I even be getting rid of the codeGamecode class and somehow having the other objects all calling each otherp

As long as i dont scroll to the last entry with the image everything stays alright.p  pBut after i scrolled to the last entry with the image, the data somehow gets totally mixed up. When i now scroll up again suddenly also the 4th the 9th and the 14th entry contains an image and exactly the same image like the last entry two entries should not contain the same image.p  pSo my question is how can it be possible that the list gets corrupted after i scroll to an entry with an image How can the image of the last entry suddenly be copied to other entriesp

Negative 16383 pIm implementing some sort of lookup for words in c, and while the code for implementing a map is there, I wanna make sure if it works that using a map with keys and values as stdstring, and using only keys as lookups without a value to return. p  precode    stdvectorlt stdstringgt DictionLines     Reader DictionReaderDictionary     DictionLines  DictionReader.getLines     stdmapltstdstring, stdstringgt DictionaryM      for int t  0 t lt DictionLines.size t          DictionaryM.insertstdpairltstdstring, stdstringgtDictionLines.att, DictionLines.att      codepre  pThis code takes in the 349900 words in a Dictionary.txt file, and stores them in the map. Each line of the dictionary is just the word to lookup no definition or any value to associate.

Negative 16383 pI am fairly new to NoSQL databases and I usually dont have an issue, but in my latest mobile app I am trying to use Amazons DynamoDB and I have hit a wall. p  pGenerally, I have no issues if the table contains unique, single entries.  However, if the table contains a list of items associated with a specific attribute, I am not sure how to retrievequery the data properly.  p  pFor example, below is a table.  We will call it IAWSDDBSESSIONSI.  It contains all the information about the user sessions where SessionID is the hash keyp  pAssume that the table data is represented as follows  iSessionIDhash, StartTime, StopTime, UserEmailip  pre      TableName  AWSDDBSESSIONS     AAADFR101, 011000.000Z, 111000.000Z, john.doemydomain.com     BBBLWL102, 122000.000Z, 182000.000Z, jane.smithmydomain.com     CCCUFE103, 030000.000Z, 033000.000Z, john.doemydomain.com  pre  pbr I can easily get a single entry if I specify the hash key valueSessionID.  For example, if I wanted the first item in the listAAADFR101, I would just make a getItem request with the specified SessionID  p  pre Amazons Java SDK PseudoCode   AmazonSDK.API.Table.getItemAAADFR101  The SQL equilavent is     select  from AWSDDBSESSIONS where SessionIDAAADFR101   Expected Results   AAADFR101, 011000.000Z, 111000.000Z, john.doemydomain.compre  pbr However, if I want to get all the sessions that are associated with john.doemydomain.com, I have no idea what to do.  p  pre      Amazons Java SDK PseudoCode        Create a Condition...

The SQL equilavent is       select  from AWSDDBSESSIONS where UserIDjohn.doemydomain.com      Expected Results       AAADFR101, 011000.000Z, 111000.000Z, john.doemydomain.com       CCCUFE103, 030000.000Z, 033000.000Z, john.doemydomain.com  pre  pAs mentioned above, the Java pseudo code doesnt work because Amazons DynamoDB API requires that primary key SessionID when you perform a query.  Even if you changed the DynamoDB tables schema to use a hash key SessionID and a range UserEmail, it does you no good.  Essentially, you run into the same problem.p  pI tried to come up with some alternative solutions, but I seem to come back to the same problem no matter how I approach it.p  pbr BR BAlternative 1B The first alternative that I thought of, was to add another attribute which was a unique identifier.  So you would change the schemap  pre      Original Schema         SessionIDhash, StartTime, StopTime, UserEmail      New Table Schema       RecordIDhash, SessionID, StartTime, StopTime, UserEmail  pre  pThis creates a table similar to one that you would use in a Relational Database RDB.  However, it suffers from the original problem of not being able to query on UserEmail.p  pbr BAlternative 2B After some online research, it was stated that you could split the table up into smaller tables based on various attributes userEmail.  So for every user you could create a table to store their session info in.  Hence, our original sample would be split into tables with the following datap  pre      TableName  AWSDDBSESSIONSjane.smithmydomain.com     BBBLWL102, 122000.000Z, 182000.000Z       TableName  AWSDDBSESSIONSjohn.doemydomain.com     AAADFR101, 011000.000Z, 111000.000Z     CCCUFE103, 030000.000Z, 033000.000Z  pre  pIn some cases this approach is recommended because it would nudge you in the direction of removing the redundant data UserEmail and it may lower your costs because it scans less data while querying the tables.  But it seems to create a scalability issue.  If you have 5 people using your app, then you would only have 5 tables to worry about.  However, if your user base grows to 1000, 100K, or 1 Million, then you would have a crazy amount of tables to keep track of.  So I am not sure if this is the best approach.p  pBR BAlternative 3B I tried to add some indexes for the attributes that I thought were important, but it didnt work as I had thought and still had the same original problem. p  pbr BAlternative 4B Change the hash key from the SessionID, to the UserEmail, and then use the SessionID as the range key.  But it seems that this may not work under certain circumstances such as when these values overlap, have different attribute fields, or if the attributes have the same value.  For example, if John Doe had another Session with ID of AAADFR101 then it would overwrite the existing entry instead of having 2 entries with similar information.  You can overcome this challenge by adding a new attribute RecordID and use that as the primary key hash value.  However, you are back to the original problem would you try to query.p  pbr Ugh... My head is starting to hurt.  Can someone point me in the right direction.  p  pThanks in advance,p  pRandyp

Negative 16383 pIm trying to submit a dynamically generated user login form using Scrapy and then parse the HTML on the page that corresponds to a successful login.p  pI was wondering how I could do that with Scrapy or a combination of Scrapy and Selenium. Selenium makes it possible to find the element on the DOM, but I was wondering if it would be possible to give control back to Scrapy after getting the full HTML in order to allow it to carry out the form submission and save the necessary cookies, session data etc. in order to scrape the page.p  pBasically, the only reason I thought Selenium was necessary was because I needed the page to render from the Javascript before Scrapy looks for the codeltformgtcode element. Are there any alternatives to this, howeverp  pThank youp  pemEdit This question is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24864832scrapyandseleniumsubmitformthatrendersdynamicallythis onea, but unfortunately the accepted answer deals with the Requests library instead of Selenium or Scrapy. Though that scenario may be possible in some cases a hrefhttpswww.youtube.comwatchveRSJSKG4mDA relnofollowwatch this to learn morea, as alecxe points out, Selenium may be required if parts of the page [such as forms] are loaded via API calls and inserted into the page with the help of javascript code being executed in the browser.emp

Negative 16383 pI have a WebAPI backend for a mobile, and want to host it in Azure.br I am having a hard time figuring out the real differences between AMS and Websites.p  pAll the articles I read about the subject talks about changes and benefits in general, and I want to understand specifically which new features AMS provides, and the benefits of hosting in AMS.  p  h2Authenticationh2  hr  pIn AMS I see the IDENTITY tab in azure portal. From what I understand, those 3rd party configs allow me to authenticate my users easily with google,FB etc. But this is just making the process more convenient and configurable via UI. In Websites, I can achieve the same functionality pretty easily using code from ASPNet.Identity and OWIN libraris.  p  h2Push Notificationsh2  hr  pAgain looking at AMS in the PUSH tab, I can see two mechanisms. The Notification Hub and 3rd party section.  p  pThe Notification Hub is nothing special to AMS, and I can get the exact same functionality when hosting in Websites.  p  pThe 3rd party section allows me to configure credentials to push services from Apple and Google APNS,GCM... and together with libraries in AMS namespace I can easily write code to communicate with those services. p  pBut When hosting in Websites, in my backend I can use open source libraries. For example, MoonAPNS to talk to APNS.  p  h2Scaleh2  pAs far as I understand, both Websites and AMS allows the same scale functionality One calls it Units and the other Instances. p  hr  pAre there any big differences I missedbr Are any of the claims I made are incorrect  It would be great if anyone could shed some light on the matter, specifically addressing all the 3 issues Auth,Push,Scale.p

I already did this few months ago but I scraped it because its an additional performance overhead to use a tool such as MsTest within a launcher such as mine. For anyone interested, theres a file located within VSs installation directory, its called VsDevCmd.bat, I load this .bat within a hiddeninbackground cmd with few additional commands  mstest, testcontainer, test. This works but as I said I have no other plausible ideas.  There may also be a lack of referenced libraries within my Form  Maybe something, a .dll that initialized the testenvironment and the testContext variable. I wrote this because there may be others seeking the same result.p

Negative 16383 pThis has always piqued me whenever I had a project that required this but I wasnt able to find a solution. Im dealing with altering the percentage of something from ex 116 or 6.25 to ex 625. That would mean for the number line to be even, 1.0 or 100 would have to be in the middle. That doesnt work though because the decimals take up less space. 6.25 is closer to 100 on a number line than 625.p  pBegs the question, how would one go about stretching the portion that lies below 100 so that 100 is in the middlep

Negative 16383 pI am going through different concurrency model in multithreading environment a hrefhttptutorials.jenkov.comjavaconcurrencyconcurrencymodels.htmlhttptutorials.jenkov.comjavaconcurrencyconcurrencymodels.htmlap  pThe article highlights about three concurrency models.p  p1 Parallel Workersp  pThe first concurrency model is what I call the parallel worker model. Incoming jobs are assigned to different workers.p  p2 Assembly Linep  pThe workers are organized like workers at an assembly line in a factory. Each worker only performs a part of the full job. When that part is finished the worker forwards the job to the next worker.p  pEach worker is running in its own thread, and shares no state with other workers. This is also sometimes referred to as a shared nothing concurrency model.p  p3 Functional Parallelismp  pThe basic idea of functional parallelism is that you implement your program using function calls. Functions can be seen as agents or actors that send messages to each other, just like in the assembly line concurrency model AKA reactive or event driven systems. When one function calls another, that is similar to sending a message.p  pNow I want to map java API support for these three conceptsp  p1 Parallel Workers  Is it ExecutorService,ThreadPoolExecutor, CountDownLatch APIp  p2 Assembly Line  Sending an event to messaging system like JMS amp using messaging concepts of Queues amp Topics. Am I correctp  p3 Functional Parallelism ForkJoinPool to some extent amp java 8 streams. ForkJoin pool is easy to understand compared to streams. p  pAm I correct in mapping these concurrency models If not please correct me.p

Negative 16383 pforgive my ignorant brain but i am having trouble understanding ATmega 128 and i need to complete this code for school in less than 24 hours.p  pI tried everything, videos, books, lectures and unfortunately my teacher is not responding to my emails so i thought i might get some help here to understand this code.p  pBackground Two systems based on ATmega128 called system A and system B will cooperate. In system A 20 bytes of data 8 bit integers stored. These will be transferred on a parallel form to system B for addition. When the addition is completed the result is sent back to the system A, where the results are stored from address 0x100 least significant byte is stored first. It is assumed that all numbers are positive. System B is already created but the program that controls the system B is incomplete. You should complete it, and make system A.p  pWith a lot of difficulties, i made system B and it is working, but i really have no idea how to make system A.p  pIf anyone could help me start, or give me the code i need, i would be really thankful.p  pHere is my code for system Bp  precode .include m128def.inc .def tempr16 .dseg .org 0x100 suml .byte 1 sumh .byte 1 .cseg rjmp init .org 0x46 init ldi temp,0 out ddrb,temp ldi temp,2 out ddrc,temp clr temp out portc,temp sts suml,temp sts sumh,temp start sbis pinc,0 rjmp start in r17,pinb clr r18 lds r19,suml lds r20,sumh add r19,r17 adc r20,r18 sts suml,r19 sts sumh,r20 sbi portc,1 ventb1 sbic pinc,0 rjmp ventb1 cbi portc,1 cpi r17,0 brne start ldi temp,0xff out ddrb,temp lds temp,suml out portb,temp sbi portc,1 ventb2 sbis pinc,0 rjmp ventb2 cbi portc,1 ventb3 sbic pinc,0 rjmp ventb3 lds temp,sumh out portb,temp sbi portc,1 ventb4 sbis pinc,0 rjmp ventb4 cbi portc,1 ventb5 sbic pinc,0 rjmp ventb5 clr temp out portb,temp sbi portc,1 ventb6 sbis pinc,0 rjmp ventb6 cbi portc,1 ventb7 sbic pinc,0 rjmp ventb7 jmp init codepre
