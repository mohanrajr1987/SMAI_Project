Positive 980 pOk, so Im out of my depths with this one. p  pI am building a website for my mother who is starting up a very smallscale business offering child meditation lessons. Once parents apply their children via the online form I want them to receive a nice looking email, that has some basic imagery e.g. company logo. p  pI got the websites HTMLformPHP combo to work properly. This means I am able to get the PHP to send a plain text email message upon people submitting the form. p  pWhen I changed the body in the PHP file from plain text into a free HTMLemailtemplate I found online the email stopped from popping up in my Gmail. First, the PHPsyntax was wrong, but I managed to fix that. I then tried to send a simple HTML email via PHP and it was indeed received successfully by Gmail. However when I tried the entire template again, it stopped working.. After a lot of trialanderror I discovered that Gmail stopped receiving the email as soon as I included an lt IMG tag into the HTML code in the PHP file.p  pOver a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6706891embeddingimageinhtmlemailherea I learned that a picture can also be embedded inline via base64 coding. So, I adapted my HTML code so that the all the lt IMG tags had a markup similar to this onep  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodeltimg srcdataimagejpgbase64,base64datastring here gtcodepre div div p  pNow, the email does indeed show up in Gmail again. However, all my images are shown as plaintext base64 codestrings. p  pI have also read at multiple places that this problem might be tackled by adding your images as attachments and by using a contentID. Ive found numerous ways of doing this, and I have tried many of them, but all examples Ive found so far seem incomplete and I am apparently lacking the knowledge to see the bigger picture funny metaphor. So I havent got any of them to work.p  pWhat I have not yet managed to find as well is a simple PHPmailtemplate of an HTML email, containing an image, and that is proven to work with Gmail as well. Does anybody know if they exist For Id probably be able to extract what I need to do from there.. p  pIf not, would anybody be willing to help me out directly via my own PHP code p  pHeres what Ive

Positive 980 pHas anyone done something every simply around retrieving emails from a gmail account with node.js or mocha There are a few modules around, all with some complexity in the setup, which is understandable. The official google api docs show a fair bit of code. We are setting up unit tests for a system that sends alert emails, and we just want to ensure that the email is sent, arrived, and contains x in the body. We are using mocha to do the tests. Any thoughts appreciated.p

Negative 980 pOn Linux or Solaris is there a better way than hand parsing codeprocselfmapscode repeatedly to figure out whether or not you can read, write or execute whatever is stored at one or more addresses in memoryp  pFor instance, in Windows you have codeVirtualQuerycode. p  pIn Linux, I can codemprotectcode to change those values, but I cant read them back.p  pFurthermore, is there any way to know when those permissions change e.g. when someone uses codemmapcode on a file behind my back other than doing something terribly invasive and using codeptracecode on all threads in the process and intercepting any attempt to make a codesyscallcode that could affect the memory mapp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pUnfortunately, Im using this inside of a JIT that has very little information about the code it is executing to get an approximation of what is constant. Yes, I realize I could have a constant map of mutable data, like the vsyscall page used by Linux. I emcanem safely fall back on an assumption that anything that isnt included in the initial parse is mutable and dangerous, but Im not entirely happy with that option.p  pRight now what I do is I read codeprocselfmapscode and build a structure I can binary search through for a given addresss protection. Any time I need to know something about a page that isnt in my structure I reread procselfmaps assuming it has been added in the meantime or Id be about to segfault anyways.p  pIt just seems that parsing text to get at this information and not knowing when it changes is awfully crufty. codedevinotifycode doesnt work on pretty much anything in codeproccodep

Negative 980 pIm building an outlook addin, and I was wondering if there was any standard way to have the addin update itself when we release new versions or at least notify the user to visit our website and downloadinstall the newest version The naive way Ive been thinking about doing is just pinging our server every once in a while to check for updates, and showing a messagebox. Thanksp
Negative 980 pWe are tracking down some memory issues in our application and we have visibility into the size of our sessions where the problem seems to be.  It is only affecting certain sessions where they seem to balloon out of control and wed like to have the ability to invalidate those sessions moreorless by hand to reclaim that memory .  Is there a way to do this through JMX  We are using JBoss 4.5.2 .p  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 980 pI need a very simple process that listens on a directory and  does some operation when a new file is created on that directory.p  pI guess I need a thread pool that does that.p  pThis is very easy to implement using the spring framework, which I normally use but I cant use it now.

Negative 980 pWhen I search the web for inserting BLOBs into Oracle database with jdbc thin driver, most of the webpages suggest a 3step approachp  ol liinsert codeemptyblobcode value.li liselect the row with codefor updatecode.li liinsert the real value.li ol  pThis works fine for me, here is an examplep  precodeConnection oracleConnection  ...  byte[] testArray  ...

Is the first solution better speed, memory consumption,... Any reasons for not using the simpler second approachp  pThe exact same question applies for CLOB fields.p

Negative 980 pIve created an HttpModule in ASP.NET to allow users to upload large files.  I found some sample code online that I was able to adapt for my needs.  I grab the file if it is a multipart message and then I chunk the bytes and write them to disk.  p  pThe problem is that the file is always corrupt.

Negative 980 pCheers,p  pafter seeing Stack Overflows excellent implementation of OpenID, and after seeing what great job Google did with OpenID, I implemented it on a web app Im working on. During my research I ran into Plaxo as another great RP.p  pRecently, Facebook added some rudimentary OpenID support. Its apparently used for completely different purposes that ordinarily I didnt find a way to ilog ini with OpenID there. Yet, theres one thing that caught my attention on Googlehosted UI, they had a Facebook logo, and a bit different heading. At first I thought this might be because of the new popup extension recently designed precisely because of Facebook. However I edited the authorization URL and removed reference to the popup extension, and the icon was still there. When I wrote the extension support, it didnt add the icon.p  pI looked around, and Plaxos got their icon on Googles auth page as well. p  pAlthough this might be a result of business deal between Google and Plaxo, and Google and Facebook, it might not be the case. So I am wondering Does anyone have idea how to add this iconp  pin.b. Ive a hrefhttpgroups.google.comgroupgooglefederatedloginapibrowse5Fthreadthread6aa1975a5eece968 relnofollowinquired about thisa on Googles Federated Login API group, and received no response. Ive also repeatedly did searching on the internet apparently there isnt many people who noticed this and who are sufficiently interested in this.ip

Negative 980 pIm facing a bit of difficulties implementing the HA for my ActiveMQ service. Right now, Ive correctly implemented the Master  Slave brokers of Active MQ, so if the master dies, the slave takes over the message delivery transparently. They both share a Microsoft SQL database to store the messages.p  pI wanted to add another level of High Availability, ensuring a database mirroring. Like this, if the principal DB server dies, the brokers will switch to the mirrored one. Ive set up correctly the mirroring. the data is correctly mirrored to the secondary DB server.p  pThe problem is that the DB failover messes up everything.p  pAs you know, the master  slave HA of the ActiveMq brokers works as follows the master takes the lock in the DB and the slave tries to take it. As soon as the master dies, it frees the lock and the slave takes over and the clients switches to the new one. Problem comes with the DB mirroring. when i shutdown the principal DB server, the master fails to update the database locks. On the other hand, the slave, when he is unable to take the lock in the principal DB server, tries the secondary and of course he cannot, as its in the mirrored state.p  pIf i dont use the master  slave HA for activeMQ only one broker then the DB mirroring works.p  pHere are the configuration file and log of the masterp  precodelt     Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation ASF under one or more     contributor license agreements.

This seems like a graph algorithm to me, so Ill reformulate this as a graphp  h2Viewed as a Graphh2  ul liThe vertices are the people in the groupli liThe edges are directed and weighted by the amount owed.  For example, an edge from Mike to Rachel with weight 500 means that Mike owes Rachel 500.li liConstraint the net sum of weights for each node must remain unchanged.li liThe goal is to find a graph with the minimum number of edges that still satisfy the constraint.li ul

Negative 980 pI know that ARM actually has some support for Java and SUN obviously, but I havent really references seen any chip vendor supporting a .Net JIT compiler.

Negative 980 pHow can I get a reference to the directory of the visual studio project or solution or the directory of the t4 template from within a t4 templatep  pI have a template that concatenates a number of files together which are located relative to the template. I need to get a reference to there absolute location through a relative means. Hard coding an absolute path is not acceptable because the visual studio project will not always be in the same location and this would break the code generation. Reading the current working directory from the environment doesnt work either because that returns the location of where the T4 engine lives not the template. Im just getting in to t4 so any help would be appreciated.p

Negative 980 pThis is my first post here at stackoverflow.  My question is how to change the google calendar feed so that it only shows events for the current day automaticallyp  pBasically what I want to do is output the feed onto a webpage that only shows events for today.  The feed would change day by day.  Ive done something similar with other feeds not google calendar before except in those cases, I would be outputting the most recent  of posts.  This wouldnt work if I were to show events for today only.p  pIve searched around on yahoo pipes and found a few where it filters the feed with a date that you have to input.  This works except I want to be able to make it automatic instead of having someone input the date.  Reading the google calendar feed api, theres also a date range I can do, but its the same issue, I would have to specify the range by hand.  Is there any way to automate that or some other alternativep  pIs there some xslt magic I can do or somethingp  pThanks for the helpp
Negative 980 pIm writing an iPhone application that needs to send small bits of information two strings of under 128 characters each, at a time, and this doesnt happen too frequently to a server when users interact with it. I would like this information to remain confidential, so Im thinking of some sort of encryption or secure connection would be necessary.p  pMy question is about the server side of things. The server the iPhone app has to communicate with is written in django and is running on lighttpd. What is the most appropriate way or what is a standard way of doing this. I was thinking https, which I know on the iPhone I can use ASIHTTPRequest to do a POST request, but I dont know what it requires on the server side.

Mind you, there is no business logic embedded in any of these UCs whatsoever thats all in the Domain layer.p  pThis approach was driven by two factors p  ol liOur application has many pages that are essentially variants on the same view with slightly different layouts. li lipFurthermore, our UI designer is fond of allowing discrete parts of a page to be opened up for editing. Click a hrefhttpimg690.imageshack.usimg6904474viewb.jpg relnofollowherea for a poor attempt at illustrating this concept.p  pAnyway, it felt like giving the UCs the abilityresponsibility to render and persist themselves would do away with quite a bit of code duplication.pli ol  pIf this approach is indeed considered icky, please feel free to suggest an alternate one that is more appealing perhaps MVP  Im stuck with WebForms for the foreseeable future.p  pThanksp
Negative 980 pWe currently have a website at somedomain.netcodefest. We do not own this server or this domain name.p  pDue to capacity problems, we are now moving to a new server. Since we do not own the old domain name, we are also moving to a new domain name.p  pSince well need to abandon the old server soon, well be redirecting all requests to somedomain.netcodefestanything to newdomain.netanything.p  pMy problem is, after a lot of effort, our websites page rank is now fairly significant. Im sure moving our website to a new domain name will be drastically detrimental to our websites search engine rank.p  pIs there any way we can tell the search bots that weve moved the website Perhaps, when I redirect from the old site, if I give a 302 redirect, search spiders will notice itp  pIs there any other issue related to moving our website that I should be aware ofp  pThanks,br jrhp

Negative 980 pI am trying to set up error handling for a MSAccess application. The standard method to do this seems to be with an On Error statement in each subroutinefunction. It seems simpler to me to use the FormError function to catch all the runtime errors in that form as opposed to an On Error statement for each subfunction called by an event on that form. Obviously, for code in modules, there is no FormError function and therefore the only method is the On Error statement   p  pWhat are the pros and cons of using On Error vs FormErrorp

Negative 980 pI am trying to detect time since last user input using the X11 Screen Saver extension client library. I make periodic calls to codeXScreenSaverQueryInfocode to get the idle time. The problem I am facing is that after every 2030 seconds the idle time, as reported by this call, resets to 0. This happens even though there has been no actual user input in that time. I am totally puzzled by this. The only lead I have is that the problem disappears if I uninstall codegnomescreensavercode. My question is, does the codegnomescreensavercode simulate user inputs for some reason I know it sounds unlikely, and if it does, it will most definitely be a bug with codegnomescreensavercode, but I cannot think of anything else right now.

Negative 980 pIm running batch Java on an IBM mainframe under JZOS.  The job creates 0  6 .txt outputs depending upon what it finds in the database.  Then, I need to convert those files from Unix to MVS ebcdic and Im using OCOPY command running under IKJEFT01.  However, when a particular output was not created, I get a JCL error and the job ends.  Id like to check for the presence or absence of each file name and set a condition code to control whether the IKJEFT01 steps are executed, but dont know what to use that will access the Unix file pathnames.br I have resolved this issue by writing a COBOL program to check the converted MVS files and set return codes to control the execution of subsequent JCL steps.  The completed job is now undergoing user acceptance testing. Perhaps it sounds like a kludge, but it does work and Im happy to share this solution.    p

Negative 980 pUsing boostasio in C, Im trying to determine the best way to encrypt packets in my program. I thought of defining packets all by myself by type number, each with different fixed packet sizes. The system reads the header type, and quantity of entries for lists of data and creates the appropriate structure to receive the data, then it reacts according to the data received.p  pHowever, when I look at this method, I wonder if there would be a simpler way to accomplish this without sacrificing efficiency.p  pThese packets are to be sent between different applications trough TCP. Ideally, Im aiming at both applications using as least bandwidth and CPU as possible while also being as simple to modify as possible. Any suggestionsp

Negative 980 pHi all I am relatively new to OOD and Java hence am not sure how to do this properly.p  pCurrently I need to create an application consolecommand prompt based that involves going through a series of so called menus where the application will display your choices and you enter 1234 etc. My professor told me to break up my boundary class the class where all the display of choices is in because its too long 400 lines. p  pNow comes the problem. If i were to break it up, I would have to keep creating new object classes to call on the different menu in different classes. For examplep  pLet say I have MainMenu, FoodMenu, DrinkMenu. So my main method will create a MainMenu object to call displayMenu. From there, if I want to navigate to the food menu, I have to create another FoodMenu object and call displayMenu under it again. Further along the codes, if i want to navigate back to the main menu, I would then again have to create the MainMenu object again and call displayMenu. p  pThe above method would have so many variables waiting to be garbage collected and a total waste of memory. Is there another solution around this Thank you very much in advance.p  pHamlynp

Negative 980 pIve got a program Im writing for a class to substitute the leftmost occurrence of a variable with a new variable. It actually allows you to provide an equivalence relation yourself, as well. The thing is, in Chez Scheme 8.2, this substitutes the rightmost occurrence, if the left most is inside a list. We use a server running some version of scheme Im not sure which version, and on the server it substitutes, correctly, the leftmost occurrence. Below is the codep  precodedefine substleftmost   lambda new old ls proc     let [keepgoing t]       letrec [helper          lambda ls            cond [null ls ls]              [or pair car ls null car ls               cons helper car ls helper cdr ls]              [and keepgoing proc old car ls               set keepgoing f cons new cdr ls]              [else cons car ls helper cdr ls]] helper ls codepre  pThis is called like so substleftmost x a d b c a b a eq which should produce the output d b c x b a, and does on the server.

Negative 980 pIm  new to objectiveC so, bear with me. I started with the Universal App template in Xcode4 and built my application. There is a convention that the template starts you off with that I tried to stick with. For each View Controller, theres a main file and a subclass for each device type.

Negative 980 pIm looking at the Notes app example from the Android SDK. What I want to learn how to do is instead of using a CursorAdapter to just pass to a ListAdpaterListView to sort out, I want to know how I can deal with the data myself particularly in an ArrayList form.

I want to know how I can query the SQLite database and use the cursor it returns to collect the data and create object instances of an object Ill call Note which has parameters for id, title, and body. I ultimately want to store all these objects into an ArrayList for management. Im just not sure how to deal with a Cursor.

Negative 980 pI am about pull all of my hair at once. Needless to say, I am frustrated. I am coding within Delphi Prism for .NET and currently working to get my applications userdefined properties saved into Application config file. I have setup everything as follows.

So, I looked into the app.config file thinking they will all be there, but I didnt see any of the values saved in the file match the values that is being retrieved. It only has default values I put into Properties.Designer. Someone did say online that config file will only be updated when you run your application outside of Delphi Prism IDE. And I did, that still didnt work. I even rebooted my computer thinking that maybe Delphi Prism is flaky and it needed a quick break.

Negative 980 pI am redesigning a few databases into one encompassing database, and I have noticed the previous designers of the old databases like to store categories in their own tables. For example, say that there is a table boatsbid integer, bname string, color integer, and in the application there is a dropdown box allowing the user to specify the colour of the boat, then there is a table colorcid integer, cname string. I would have not included the color table, and just put the colours as strings in the boats table. I realize that this decreases redundant storage of colour names, but is the added runtime cost of joining the boat table with the colour table worth it Also the dropdowns are populated with SELECT cname FROM color statements, while I would have defined a view on SELECT DISTINCT color FROM boats to populate the dropdowns.p  pThe example is simple, but this happens multiple times in the system I am redesigning, even for categories with only two options. This has resulted in many tables with only 2 fields. Some only have 1 field I havent figured out what those are for yet, but I think they are only to populate the dropdowns, and the actual tables contain the values as well.p

Negative 980 pI have an iPhone app that I run on the simulator. XCode ver 3.2.64.3. I am trying to communicate with a radio on a serial port of a PC over wifi, both on the same server... Ive tried NSStream and GCDAsyncSocket just to make sure. The radio has its own IP address and port number. Its actually a TCPIP wifi module. After changing the remote access on the PC to accept my IP address, I am finally able to connect but I get kicked off immediately, Im assuming its when I try to read or write. Same happens when using Telnet, connects then disconnects. The radio issues emHELLOem when someone connects, so Telnet must try to read since data is sent. Im guessing.

Negative 980 pa hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comboldnewthingarchive2010121710106259.aspx10106771 relnofollowAt a reply of a blog post of Raymond Chena,p  pA questioner pointed outp  blockquote   pRaymond, I believe the C example is not correct since the position   of the base class subobject in the derived class is unspecified   according to ISO C 2003 Standard 103, page 168, and you assume   that the base class subobject is always at the beginning. The C   example would be fine in C too, so Id stick with it.  p blockquote  pRaymond repliedp  blockquote   p[The code does not make this assumption. Thats why its important to   use staticcast instead of reinterpretcast. Try it Add a virtual   method to OVERLAPPED so a vtable goes in front and observe what the   compiler does. Raymond]p blockquote  pI could guess after read his comments. Using staticcast is fine at the example but reinterpretcast is not. Because reinterpretcast is not convert vtable. Do I understand it rightlybr Though, if I use CStyle cast at therenot reinterpretcast, could it also go wrongp  pI reread More Effective Cs cast explanation to understand that. But there was no answer about that.p

Negative 980 precodeclass Result     public string Data  get set    interface IRepository     Result[] Searchstring data  codepre  pI have a fairly generic interface that searches for something and returns a codeResultcode.  The codeIRepositorycode interface can be implemented by several classes, each returning their own Result with their own unique metadata.  For example, I can have a codeDiskRepositorycode that searches for data on diskp  precodeclass DiskResult  Result     public int FileSize  get set     public DateTime LastModifiedDate  get set    class DiskRepository  IRepository     public Result[] Searchstring data             ...       DiskResult[] results  GetDataFromSomewhere       return results       codepre  pThe codeDiskResultcode contains extra information about the result that is specific to the codeDiskRespositorycode.  If I created another class that implements codeIRepositorycode, that specific implementation may have its own set of metadata unique to that class.p  pIn the end, Id like my search controller to look like thisp  precodeclass SearchController      private IRepository[] repositories     public SearchControllerIRepository[] repositories           repositories  repositories         public void Displaystring data           Result[] results  repositories.Searchdata        Display results      codepre  pI can easily display the codeDatacode property on my codeResultcode class, but is there a good pattern to display the metadata for each class that derives from codeResultcode  I could have a bunch of codeifcode statements to check if the class is of a type, but that feels a bit clunky.  Is there a better way to do what Im trying to achievep

Negative 980 pI have worked most on the legacy projects where i spot this line codectx.lookupdatasourcecode many number of times. As per usage I have encountered with Initial context , it is used to get the java object binded with some name in webserverappserver. p  ul liFor example, we create datasource thru admin console of weblogic then we can use that object programmaticaly in java program with ctx.lookupdatasource. If I recall correctly I saw this kind of code during EJB implementation also somewhere where some object that was binded with some name in server itself. li ul  pJava docs says When the initial context is constructed, its environment is initialized with properties defined in the environment parameter passed to the constructor. So probably the usage I mentioned earlier, Initial context gets constructed with environment parameterswhich probably means objects which admin has created in server like datasource, connection pool if any. This is the just  one use I could relate initial context. p  pstrongPlease let me know the if it is correct and right usage of initial context classstrongp  pstrongBasically with initial context , we can bindlookup java object with same name. In case of webserverappserver probably the objects like datasource,connection pool get binded by the server at the time of start up and we can look up them straightawaystrongp

Negative 980 pI need a hand with something I use a shared secret to prevent HTTP request forgery for a form.

How should a new shared secret be passed to the form to replace the old value in the hidden inputp  pI was thinking that the serverside file that does the processing could return the new key in plain text and JavaScript could grab it and updated the hidden inputs value.p  pI am unsure how safe doing that is.p  pIf you have a bit of good advice, please let me know.p  pThank you.p

Negative 980 pI got a strange issue with wrong URI Encoding and would appreciate any helpp  pThe project uses JSPs, Servlets, Jquery, Tomcat 6.p  pCharset in the JSPs is set to UTF8, all Tomcat connectors use URIEncodingUTF8 and I also use a character encoding filter as described a hrefhttpwiki.apache.orgtomcatFAQCharacterEncoding relnofollowherea. Also, I set the contentType in the meta Tag and my browser detects it correctly.p  pIn Ajax calls with Jquery I use encodeURIComponent on the terms I want to use as URL Parameters and then serialize the whole parameter set with .param. In the called servlet these parameters are decoded correctly with Java.net.URLDecoder.decodeterm, UTF8.p  pIn some places I generate URLs for href elements from a parameter map in the JSPs. Each parameter value is encoded with Java.net.URLEncoder.encodevalue, UTF8 on JSP side but then decoding it the same way as before results in broken special characters. Instead, I have to encode it as ISO88592 in the JSP which is then decoded correctly as UTF8 in the servlet.p  pAn example for clarifying The term berfall is URIEncoded via Javascript C3BCberfall and sent to the servlet for decoding and processing, which works. After passing it back to a JSP I would encode it as UTF8 and build the URL which results for instance inp  precodelta hrefmyWebappservletPathtermC3BCberfallgtClick hereltagt codepre  pHowever, clicking this link will send the parameter as C383C2BCberfall to the servlet which decodes to berfall. The same occurs when no encoding takes place.p  pWhen, using ISO88592 for encoding I getp  precodelta hrefmyWebappservletPathtermFCberfallgtClick hereltagt codepre  pWhen clicking this link I can observe in Wireshark that C3BCberfall is sent as parameter which decodes again to berfallp  pCan anyone tell me where I miss somethingp  pEDIT While observing the Network Tab in Firebug I realized that by using p  precode.paramterm  encodeURIComponentterm  codepre  pthe term is UTF8 encoded twice, resulting in 25C325BCberfall, i.e. the percent symbols are also percentencoded. Analogously, it works for me if I call encodeterm, UTF8 twice on each value from the parameter map.p  pEncoding once and not decoding the String results in berfall again. p

Negative 980 pMy question is more like the best route taken for the purpose for saving memory and more efficiency.p  pSo lets start off, I have a zip file which I use the class ZipInputStream to search for a specific fileImage, and after obtaining the location of the image I process it into an image and show it off to a user. Now I want to store this image so it doesnt go to the entire process of Streaming out files within a zip file.p  pI am currently doing this processp  pProcess 1 Saving the inputstream into memory into a hashmap and after I have reach a certain limit in memory I delete it.p  pProcess 2 Then I was thinking it might be more efficient if I just save out the location used within the zipInputStream and just go back to that location and just zip within the zip file through the proper location. This way I have the ability to obtain the image without straining the memory.

Process 2 may work out more memory wise and load slightly longer.p  pQuestionp  pSo which route should I take 1 , 2, or something in havent put out in this question.p

Negative 980 pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6624704datamapperpatterncomplexequeryfromservicelayerthis questiona did a very good job of clearing my confusion a bit on the matter, but Im having a hard time finding reliable sources on what the exact limitations of the service layer should be.p  pFor this example, assume were dealing with books, and we want to get books by author. The codeBookDataMappercode could have a generic codegetcode method that accepts conditions such as the books unique identifier, author name, etc. This implementation is fairly trivial logically, but what if we want to have multiple conditions that require a more complex queryp  pLets say we want to get all book written by a certain author under a specific publisher. We could expand the codeBookDataMappergtgetcode method to parse out multiple conditions, or we could write a new method such as codeBookDataMappergtgetByAuthorAndPublishercode. p  pIs it preferable to have the service layer call these [more specific] methods directly, or have the conditions parsed before calling the more generic codeBookDataMappergtgetcode method with multiple conditions passed In the latter scenario, the service layer would do more of the logical heavy lifting, leaving the data mapper fairly simple. The former option would reduce the service layer almost entirely to just a middleman, leaving conditional logic to the data mapper in methods like codeBookDataMappergtgetByAuthorAndPublishercode.p  pThe obvious concern with letting the service layer parse the conditions is that some of the domain logic leaks out of the data mapper. this is explained in the linked question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6624704datamapperpatterncomplexequeryfromservicelayercomment78339996626011herea. However if the service layer was to handle the conditions, the logic wouldnt make it out of the model layer The controller would call codebookservicegtgetByAuthorAndPublishercode regardless.p

Negative 980 pI am currently adding validation to a form. There are two things to check The correctness of the value itself e.g. if it is a positive integer or valid email and whether all required fields were filled in.p  pHowever, if by some means codefajaxcode or IceFaces codepartialSubmitcode attribute I make the validation for type correctness happen at once e.g. when the field loses focus, it will also check the coderequiredcode attribute in this same step. In most cases this is no problem, as the user already entered a value and is likely to correct it rather than go back to a blank field.p  pHowever, in the case where he actually wants to clear the field again, he can no longer do so without getting an error. In consequence, I only want to check the requiredness of fields on finally submitting the page. p  pAt the moment, my only idea to separate the two validation types is by performing all requiredchecks in the backing beans action method, thus tying it to directly to the final submit via button.p  pIs there another wayp  pFor background The reason why one might want to clear the field again is that requirements can change depending on other selections in the form. So one might decide to not provide this field after all and only after that correct the option that actually makes this field optional.p

Negative 980 pMy understanding is that the fundamental tenant of OO design is that one should focus on modeling a class as the union of code and data.  In day to day development, however, I tend to separate all of my business logic into classes of their own.  The data ends up being in tightly controlled POCOsDTOs with basically no real code or logic.  I then instantiate a business logic class and pass in POCOs to each method whenever I want an operation to occur.p  pBut this feels like two separate approaches.  In fact, the latter approach seems to be at odds with the purpose of OOp  pI supposed Ive always kept the two things separate since business logic may function on multiple POCOs.  Plus, emnotem forcing validation on the data in the POCOs made it easier to unit test since it seemed simpler to prepare the POCO for a test no need to worry about internal class state, encapsulation, etc.  Now that Im looking back on those reasons, they seem weak.p  pIm looking for a comparisoncontrast of the two approaches.  Specifically, why does it seem that making dumb POCOs is the way to go these days  Why not just stick the data and the business logic into a single class  Are we abandoning the original goals of object oriented designp  pThanksp

Negative 980 pI have a videoWall and a videoWallDetail page.  Currently, this is what I have on the videoWallDetail pagep  precode    if String.IsNullOrEmptyRequest[videoid] Response.RedirectvideoWall.aspx codepre  pUsers should not enter the detail page this way, but if they know the video id, some might go straight to the detail page by typing it into the url, so this will redirect users back to the videoWall page if they enter a video id in the address bar that is not valid.  My question is how do I redirect back to the videoWall page regardless.  If a user does not click on a link to get to the detail page of a particular video, they get sent back no matter if they enter a valid id into the address bar.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 980 pI have stumbled upon a piece of code that generates some interesting results while debugging someone elses program.p  pI have created a small program to illustrate this behaviorp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  int main          char word  foobar int i, iterator  0         for i  0 i lt 6 i ampamp iterator           printfc, word[iterator]         return 0  codepre  pI know that this is not the right way to print a string. This is for demonstration purpose only.p  pHere I expected the output to be foobar, obviously, but instead it is ffooba. Basically it reads the first character twice, as if the first time codeiteratorcode is executed nothing happens.p  pCan anyone explain why this happensp
Negative 980 pI am trying to use a hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferencealgorithmremovecopyif relnofollowremovecopyifa to copy an codeiterablecode directly to codestdoutcode through a hrefhttpwww.cplusplus.comreferencestditeratorostreamiterator relnofollowostreamiteratora. The coderemovecopyifcode guarantees that the codereturn valuecode is an codeiteratorcode to the end of the output range. This return value is useful in a way to determine the no of elements copied to the destination, by finding out the distance between the start of the output iterator and the return iterator. This makes sense when using a container but how to use the same functionality to determine the no of elements copied to the destination if its an codeostreamiteratorcode.p  pThe following example should make more sense to what I might want to achievep  precodeincludeltvectorgt includeltiteratorgt includeltalgorithmgt includeltfunctionalgt includeltiostreamgt include lttime.hgt using namespace std int  main      int rawdata[]  1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11     vectorltintgt data20     vectorltintgtiterator curr  removecopyifrawdata,rawdata  sizeofrawdatasizeofrawdata[0],data.begin,bind2ndgreaterltintgt,10     wcoutltltLNo of data copied  ltltcurr  data.beginltltendl     forint i0ilt10i      int somevalue  rand20  1     ostreamiteratorltintgt curr  removecopyifdata.begin,data.end,ostreamiteratorltintgtcout,bind2ndlessltintgt,somevalue     if curr  what gt 0          coutltltendl          return 0       codepre
Negative 980 pI have a problem. I want to run the scipy.stats foneway ANOVA in a script that loads a dataarchive containing groups with numpy arrays like sop  precodearchivegroup1 array[ 1, 2, 3, ..., ],         group2 array[ 9, 8, 7, ..., ],         ... codepre  pNow my problem is that the number of groups is not fixed for different dataarchives. In other words, I dont know beforehand, how many groups there are in an archive and also not necessarily what their names are. p  pThe a hrefhttpdocs.scipy.orgdocscipyreferencegeneratedscipy.stats.foneway.htmlscipy implementation of a oneway ANOVAa only accepts comma delimited arrays as input like sop  precodea  array[ 1, 2, 3, ..., ] b  array[ 9, 8, 7, ..., ] c  array[ 5, 6, 4, ..., ]  scipy.stats.fonewaya, b, c codepre  pI tried to give it lists, tuples, multidimensional arrays all without success. So presently, the only way I can use this ANOVA implementation is by manually entering the group variables each time which effectively makes it impossible to run this in a script. I am wondering if one of you has an idea how to solve this or how to avoid these very specific data format requirements of foneway.p
Negative 980 pIs it possible to configure that Eclipse IDE so that it automatically downloads and displays source code for dependency classes that are used I tried using CTRLclick on the text codejava.lang.annotation.retentioncode, but the source of codejava.lang.annotation.retentioncode wasnt automatically downloaded and displayed when I navigated to it. Instead, I got the usual source not found error message. I want to know if its possible to configure Eclipse so that it automatically attaches the source for codejava.langcode classes and perhaps other classes as well, so that the source wont need to be manually attached.p

Negative 980 pWe have a legacy system that produces files that each contains hundreds of messages financial transactions. We need to transform these messages into another format and submit them individually to a target system. The question is Should ESB accept these files for processing directly, or should there be an adapter application between the legacy system and ESB that would split received files into individual messages and let the ESB to process the messages individually instead of processing the whole filep  pIn the first solution we expect two ESB flows. The first one would transform the file into a new format, split it into the messages, and store these messages into a temporary location. The transformation needs to process the file as a whole, because the file contains some common sections that are needed for transformation of the individual messages. The second flow would take the individual transformed messages each in a separate DB transaction, pass them to the target system, and wait for its answer synchronously or asynchronously.p  pThe second solution would replace the first flow by an external application that would transform the file, split it into individual transformed messages, and store them in a temporary location local file system. The second flow would stay in the ESB.p  pIn our eyes, the disadvantage of the first solution is in that the ESB would have to process huge files in the first flow, which is commonly considered an antipattern. On the other hand, the ESB would adjust directly to the interface of the legacy system, which is one of the purposes of ESB.p  pIn the second solution, the adapter application would contain the transformation logic, which should be another of the purposes and responsibilities of ESB.p  pWhat is the commonly suggested solution for this situation a pattern Could you provide some references that are more descriptive than these two links that Ive foundp  pa hrefhttppublib.boulder.ibm.cominfocenteresbsoawesbv7r5index.jsptopic2Fcom.ibm.websphere.wesb.programming.doc2Ftopics2Fesbprogpatterns.html relnofollowhttppublib.boulder.ibm.cominfocenteresbsoawesbv7r5index.jsptopic2Fcom.ibm.websphere.wesb.programming.doc2Ftopics2Fesbprogpatterns.htmlap  pa hrefhttpswww.ibm.comdeveloperworkswikisdisplayesbpatternsFileProcessing relnofollowhttpswww.ibm.comdeveloperworkswikisdisplayesbpatternsFileProcessingap  pstrongEditstrong Another reference a hrefhttpwww.ibm.comdeveloperworkswebserviceslibrarywslargemessaging relnofollowhttpwww.ibm.comdeveloperworkswebserviceslibrarywslargemessagingap

The header looks like thisp  precodeprocedure updateAddress   sid       in     varchar2,   addID     in out number,   roomNo    in     varchar2,   poBox     in     varchar2,   add1      in     varchar2,   add2      in     varchar2,   add3      in     varchar2,   add4      in     varchar2,   add5      in     varchar2,   postCode  in     varchar2,   country   in     varchar2,   phone1    in     varchar2,   phone2    in     varchar2,   success   out    number  codepre  pThe purpose of this procedure is to updateappend addresses in the database. If codeaddIDcode is null, it inserts and sets codeaddIDcode to the newly inserted address ID if codeaddIDcode is not null, it just updates I havent written this bit, yet... Anyway, simple enough.p  pCalling this procedure works absolutely fine from within SQL Developer. For example, the following works perfectlyp  precodeset serveroutput on  declare   addID number   status number begin   addID  null    mypackage.updateaddressXXX11341976, addID, null, null, somewhere, else, NCx 1234, UA, null, null, null, null, null, status    dbmsoutput.putlineStatus   status    New ID   addID end  codepre  pIt outputs something like codeStatus 20  New ID 3code, where 20 is my all OK code and if I query the address table, the new address is sitting there as ID 3.p  pHowever, when I call this code from a PHP script, which uses OCI8, I get an codeORA06502code errorp  precodeORA06502 PLSQL numeric or value error character string buffer too small ORA06512 at line 1 codepre  pI know this error usually indicates that youre trying to fit too much data into some type for example, putting code999code into codenumber2code, etc. However, this isnt the case with my SP there are no limits imposed on the types and, like I say, it works fine in SQL Developer. Likewise, Im not using codedbmsoutputcode anywhere in the SP.p  pThis also occurs when I hardcode the PHP script to exactly the same parameters as the above PLSQL block, or even if I completely remove the body of the procedure and replace it with codesuccess  20code. The latter leads me to believe that theres some problem with the OCI call through PHP, rather than my PLSQL package. However, I havent got a clue what it might be Im using this code elsewhere with, admittedly, simpler procedures, and it works fine.p  pAny ideas what the source might be, or what I can look for Its driving me slightly madp

Negative 980 pI am basically a novice at using swing to begin with. So bear with me here. I can do simple GUI stuff with premade components in the swing library. However, now its gotten to the time that I am trying to figure out how to draw basic shapes onto a JPanel. In this case, it is a collection of Square objects that I have recursively gathered, and are supposed to be displayed concentrically around each other.p  pA few weeks ago we did a smaller project involving drawing shapes, except these shapes were drawn directly onto the JFrame. Now that I am trying to do this in a JPanel or a class that extends JComponent, I am running into way too many stumbling blocks.

Just been pulling my hair out trying to get this to work. I know the recursive bit works, because there are x amount of Square objects in that ArrayList after it runs. Its just the issue of painting these squares on the JPanel.p  pI tried this first with a separate class that extended JComponent, but could never get the overridden paintComponent to ever fire in it. So I looked around and found out you could override paintComponent in JPanel as well. So it is firing as expected, but nothing is appearing on the JPanel itself.p  pMy overall question is, how do I get the squares to display properlyp

Negative 980 pI want to organize a set of codeEventscode which have a unique codeidcode and a codetimecode. I want to efficiently query for codeEventscode within particular time bounds. Some codeEventscode might have the same codetimecode but different codeidcode.p  pSome codeEventscode might have the same codetimecode, so the Guava codeTreeMultiSetcode class is really close to what I need.p  pHowever, consider the following psudocode snippetp  precodeclass Event      Object id     long time   TreeMultiSetltEventgt s  TreeMultiSet.create new ComparatorltEventgt                       Override             public int compare Event o1, Event o2                               if  o1.time lt o2.time                                       return 1                                  else if  o1.time gt o2.time                                       return 1                                  else                                      return 0                                         s.add new Event a, 0   s.add new Event b, 0   s.add new Event c, 0   codepre  pAfter the three additions, the codeTreeMultiSetcode will just contain the a codeEventcode 3 times because codeTreeMultiSetcode only considers the codeComparatorcode and the three codeEventcode objects have the same codetimecode.p  pMy first thought was to incorporate codeidcode as part of my codeComparatorcode implementation to distinguish between codeEventscode with the same codetimecode, but my codeidscode have no natural ordering theyre just codeObjectscode and dont necessarily implement codeComparablecode.p  pThis would also be awkward when making codesubSetcode, codeheadSetcode, etc... queries  I dont want the codeidcode of the codeEventcode object which I use to set the query bounds to matter.p  pI could implement something custom from scratch or, more likely, delegating the heavy lifting to some underlying collections, but I wanted to make sure there wasnt something already out there which I was missing.p

It is an interactive program, specifcally it will be a textbased game, for now basically a port of World of Zuul to Python.p  pSo now I want to do good testdriven development and write a test and make sure that when the user inputs command x, that y results happen. Example when the user inputs quit, I want the program to end. I want to ensure that behavior. The only problem is, I cant seem to think of a way to give my own program input without actually typing that input into the shell, so I cant think of how to write a test for this.p  pCurrently, I have embedded the program in its own thread... I was thinking this would allow me to asynchronously give it input, but I still dont see how this can be done.p  pIs there a way to programmatically and dynamically give my own program input ...

Negative 980 pAs far as Ive read in the manuals, when you have to play a sound, you need a codeSoundcode object, and make a temporary codeSoundChannelcode object that will control the actual playback. I want to know if there is a memoryefficient way of managing those codeSoundChannelcode objects. So far it seems that these are of fireandforget type of objects, and the only way to make them semipersistent is make the call to codeSound.playcode with a really great number of plays. But this approach will not work for onetime sounds, like an arrow shot or a button click, for example. And if I call codeSoundChannel.stopcode I can as well discard the object as there is no means to make it resume playing. Is there any solution to not to spawn codeSoundChannelcode objects like crazy, and to be able to handle both onetime sound plays and infinitetime sounds aka background musicp

All these tasks took a total of 22 ms on a 200x200 maze, like mentioned earlier. I was wondering if specifically using the Queue interface would help speed up the process.

Negative 980 pAs far as i was able to find out there is two way how to get contacts on Windows phone 8. You can use either Windows.Phone.UserData at its classes and methods or Windows.Phone.PersonalInformation and its classes and methods. With UserData i have no problem i can easily get whatever is available but you have just readonly access. So thats why i use PersonalInformation for write access to contacts which kind of work fine but problem is that data from PersonalInformation and UserData cannot by easily converted to each other and they even have different information. From what i found PersonalInformation looks like better option cause it has ToVcardAsync and ParseVcardAsync methods also there is Id and remoteId field that i need to proper manipulation with contact. And my problem is that i cannot get information about contact from PersonalInformation. I am using msdn article  p  pa hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsphonedevelopjj20702428vvs.10529.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsphonedevelopjj20702428vvs.10529.aspxap  pbut when i am trying to Querying for contacts just with default settings i got nothing zero contacts and as i mentioned before if i use UserData i get all information about all contact without a problem. I had set id capability for contacts. Please help thanks.p  pEDIT After some testing i find out that from PersonalInformation through querying i can get only contacts that i had already inserted through ContactStore and StoredContact. Insert like this will create contacts with new account named by app that did this. So i am getting only contacts with this new account. i still cannot get any other contacts with other accounts that was for example created manually in phone or synchronized with one of the supported accounts.p  pAlso with reinstalling of app all saved contacts through ContactStore and StoredContact disappear. That is kind of odd.p

Negative 980 pI have a Windows Azure Website in shared mode.p  pNow Azure obviously adds two cookies to my web site codeWAWebSiteIDcode and codeARRAffinitycode. I learned that those cookies are there to enable sticky sessions with the Application and Request Routing feature ARR behind the Azure load balancers.p  pNevertheless, my web site does not require sticky sessions, and I dont want to have those cookies around.p  pFirst, I never had the slightest idea of sticky sessions crossing my mind, so I wrote the application to scale well with evenly distributed requests on all frontends. Sticky sessions in fact shift the distribution since there are clients doing a lot of requests and clients doing almost none. When only the first request gets distributed and subsequent requests from the same client stick to the same server, this has severe implications on the overall performance of my application.p  pSecondly, for data privacy reasons I run a cookieless application, and any cookie is considered evil. I know I could delete them with a little bit of javascript, but I dont even want them to be transmitted to the client.p  pThe question is How can I disable sticky sessions and those two cookies on my Azure website on server sidep

Negative 980 pOK.  Im just learning about CALayers, because Ive inherited someone elses code.  There is a view which takes up the entire background minus the toolbar and then a subview which takes up a small rectangle near the bottom of the view.  Im trying to use Auto Layout. It is the background view I am having trouble with.  Ive tried pinning the width and height and several other things I know to get the height and width to stay the size of the view 320 x 505.  Im not sure if the layers are messing me up or if its the other view.  Anyway here is the code in question.  With Auto Layout turned off the width and height are correct.  With Auto Layout turned on the width and height become negative numbers and get set to zero.

Negative 980 pI have been using pyqt and qt designer to make a program.  I wanted to custom style the top bar which holds the icon and minimize,resize,close buttons.  To do this I started with using the Qt.FramelessWindowHint and making custom buttons and such.

I was trying to sort through this but found many people talking about the problems that I am having. I was trying to go for the google chromemayaphotoshop look where the top part is completely customized.  A friend pointed out that if any of these programs crash, you can notice the windows bar will show through, which means they are not actually removing it but styling above it or something of that sort.  How can I go about doing this so all the functionality is still there but it is styled.   p

Negative 980 pSo Im building a authentication system that allows clients to view work weve created for them. There is one and only one account per client. Im trying to figure out a way to check on each page whether the person logged in is allowed to view said content.p  pBasically the file structure is like this ClientYearProject and then within the project folder there are folders for specific categories flash, landing page, etc. Within each folder there is an index.php file that handles displaying the directories or projects. I need to check on each of these index pages whether the user logged in is authorized to view the page.p  pCurrently, I have a couple session variables p  pSession[loggedin]  just a bool that is set to true when logged inp  pSession[client]  this value is grabbed from the database when they log in. Its just a string of the clients full name its also used for displaying purposes.p  pAs of now on each page I check to see if loggedin is set to true and I have this hard coded on each pagep  precodeifissetSESSION[loggedin]  SESSION[client]  Clientname    unsetSESSION    sessiondestroy    headerLocation httpwww.homepage.com  codepre  pIm not very pleased with this solution though because Im trying to make it as automated as possible  new clients will continue to be added and it should be possible for people to add clients without too much fuss all of that is working fine at this point, with the exception of thisp  pI have to check to make sure the client is correct because the following scenario could happen otherwise Client A logs in and the loggedin session is set to true...however, if they navigate to Client Bs folder structure and it only checks to see if someone is logged in they will be able to access it.p  pIs there a good practice for handling something like this I would like to implement something that can be used across all users and wont require someone to go in the code and change the client name string every time a new client is added. p  pAny sort of logical help would be greatp

I started my code with the cat test.txt, but it isnt working.  It compiles, but when I provide a file name in the command line, for example, .hwk .test.txt.  Nothing returns.  Can someone take a look and give me some hints  I want to use loops because I want to be able to add more pipes. I know theres a lot of issues in my code, so I hope someone can give me some guidance on this topic.

Negative 980 pI have 2 codeButtoncode which when clicked either add a new paragraph or remove a current paragraph. This is done using codejQuerycode. I am also using codejQuerycode to change the color of the paragraph text from black to red on codehovercode. The problem that I am having is that after I add a new paragraph with codejQuerycode, the hover effect is not being applied to it. It works for the original paragraphs but not for the ones that are being created dynamically.p  pWhen I look at the codesource codecode of the page I see that the original paragraphs have inline styles applied to them but not the ones I added via codejQuerycode. I have been looking online for the last hour trying to find a solution but so far none have worked for me. I found some similar questions but the solutions either didnt work for me or I wasnt applying them correctly. The thing is that I literally started learning codejQuerycode a couple of hours ago and therefore cannot be sure if im fixing something or making it worse.

Negative 980 pI have a very cohesive relation between codeOrdercode and codeItemcode models.p  precodeOrder hasMany Item Item belongsTo Order Item hasMany ChildItem  ChildItem is alias for Item its a recursive model codepre  pThe Order Model has a special codeOrderpreparecode function. It fires a codeOrder.preparecode event on all attached Behaviors, which control, validate and modify Item data, such as shipping, itemorder weights, quantity, discounts, ie. validating and staging the data for a emsaveem operation. It also sets the codeOrder.total, Order.weight, Order.status, ...code fields.p  pAny behavior can also stop the preparation based on its constraints stock limits, weight limits, vat, emanythingem.p  pWhen codeItemcode is added to an existing codeOrdercodep  ol liThe Order and all its existing Items are retrieved from the databaseli liThe new Item data is added to the Items arrayli liThe Order is PREPARED all behaviors run, codeItem.subtotalcodes, codeOrder.totalcode, weights and such are recalculated ...li liIf prepare is successful, all the new and modified Order and Item data is saved with Order.saveAssociated.li ol  pAfter carefully considering multiple approaches I chose the third, but I got stuckp  pemstrongbeforeSave callbacksemstrongp  pThis callback would ensure that these callbacks and calculations run on every item, but it makes it harder to retrieve related order data and items and run callbacks. It is also harder to know for sure if the data has already been prepared or not and recursion is also a problem. Harder to strongreturnstrong prepared data instead of strongsavingstrong it.p  pemstrongExtending the codeModelsavecode methodsemstrongp  pRecursion is also a problem, no way of returning the prepared data without saving and I generally avoid extending save.p  pemstrongDecoupling the preparation and save processesemstrong Creating a special workflow for order data manipulation through use of custom Model methods and callbacks eg.

Negative 980 pIm attempting to port a discrete event simulation that I wrote with Rs ReferenceClasses to C with the help of Rcpp. Ive organized my code previously into various classes based on the need to access or modify the internal data and other characteristics. Previously, I was successful using ReferenceClasses which organized these subclasses into unitlevel data and then another ReferenceClass to contain a List for all the objects in the simulation.p  pI had no trouble creating the base classes with Rcpp, but once I started creating a container class which used a constructor of elements of a subclass my instance of R started crashing. Then I tried making the container class member a pointer which decreased the number of problems the compiler was having but still didnt work. Im at a loss for what to do next...p  pHeres a short example of code thats snots now working for mep  precode forward declarations  class insider class container  include ltRcpp.hgt  using namespace Rcpp  class insider  public   NumericVector a   NumericMatrix b    insider NumericVector a, NumericMatrix b  a a , b b     insider const insider amp i   a i.a , b i.b      NumericVector getA  return a    NumericMatrix getB  return b    class container  public   insider ins    containerinsider ins  ins new insider ins      container  delete ins    insider getInsider  return ins    RCPPEXPOSEDCLASSinsider RCPPEXPOSEDCLASScontainer  RCPPMODULEmod    classltinsidergtinsider     .constructorlt NumericVector, NumericMatrix gt     .constructorlt insider gt     .methodgetA, ampinsidergetA     .methodgetB, ampinsidergetB       classltcontainergtcontainer      .constructorlt insider gt      .methodgetInsider, ampcontainergetInsider       R libraryRcpp  insider lt modinsider container lt modcontainer  a lt newinsider, 110, matrix120, ncol  2 b lt newcontainer, a  agetA agetB  bgetInsidergetA bgetInsidergetB   codepre  pEditp  pIve found a syntax error in the code edited now, so code is up to date, and now the code compiles and works.

Negative 980 pThis is a follow up for this question.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3422759phpaesencryptdecryptPHP AES encrypt  decryptap  pI was wondering about the IV. As I see this an random IV is created for decrypt and encrypt separately. And it is not passed along with the data to be decrypted.p  pIf I am not mistaken, an IV can very well be public and be transmitted along with the encrypted data. However it should be random and not reused all the time for example taking a series of zeros.p  pBut to decrypt successfully the same IV must be used that has been used to encrypt.p  pHow can the decrypt function work properly when generating a new, random IVp  pAnd it does work, i tested it...p

Negative 980 pI have a system which uses AOP with ContextBoundObject.p  pThis is used to intercept a method call and perform certain operations before and after the function. It all works fine until I make the function to be intercepted async.p  pI understand that the C compiler rewrites async methods into a state machine, which returns control to the sink as soon as await is reached So it continues into the interception and executes the code which is meant to be executed only after the Method.p  pI can see there is an AsyncProcessMessage in IMessageSink, but I cant find a way to invoke it, and I am not sure if it will work in the asyncawait scenario.p  pIs there a way to make AsyncAwait work with the ContextBoundObject Is using another Aspect Oriented Programming approach the only option herep  pThe code sample below has the method to be intercepted decorated with the Audit attribute and placed in the AuditFacade which is a ContextBoundObject.

Negative 980 pIm trying to recreate the double tap to zoom in and two finger tap to zoom out on a map, and Im having some weird animation slowness specifically when I two finger tap to zoom out. I have to do this because Im anchoring the center point on zooming, which is not possible with the default double tap and two finger tap gesturesp  pWhen Im at a close zoom level its not a problem, but once I get to a city zoom level and farther out, the animation takes an extremely long time. If I set animated to codeNOcode on codesetRegioncode it jumps to the zoom level I want without delay, which leads me to believe theres no trouble loading the bigger region.p  pIn viewDidLoad I set codezoomEnabled  NOcode and add a two finger tap gesture recognizer and double tap gesture recognizers. double tap gesture recognizer has the same problemp  pMy two finger tap code is simply thisp  precode voidmapTwoFingerTappedUITapGestureRecognizer doubleFingerTapRecognizer    double zoomScale  2   MKCoordinateSpan span  MKCoordinateSpanMakeself.map.region.span.latitudeDelta  zoomScale,                                              self.map.region.span.longitudeDelta  zoomScale    [self.map setRegionMKCoordinateRegionMakeself.map.region.center, span animatedYES]  codepre  pWhich means all I do is double the latitude and longitude and set the new region.

Negative 980 pDo any of the Spring projects provide a template or utility for inserting into or working with Greenplump  pI understand that one approach is, using Spring Batch, to have a tasklet call the Greenplum gpload utility which will then insert a specified file into the database.p  pHowever, give the fact that both the Spring Data and Spring XD projects are aiming to abstract data access and handle big data requirements, it would seem there should be something custom made for this requirement. This is expecially the case given how closely Pivotal are now involved with both GreenPlum and Spring.p  pIf anyone has any experience with working with Spring and Greenplum and can offer any pointers or best practices, it is very much appreciated.p

Negative 980 pFirst of all, sorry if this questions been asked before, but I couldnt find the answer on stackoverflow or anywhere else.p  pIm using APC and Symfonys reverse proxy cache. The app is hosted in a shared environment with limited apc.shmsize. Httpcache files are cached through APC which leads to bloating APC cache, APC full counts and of course an  important adverse impact on performance. p  pDoes it make sense to cache the httpcache directory in APC anyway Or should the httpcache directory be excluded through an APC filterp

I found out that Charles has something called Map Local... which allows me to reply to a client using files I have stored locally.p  pThe files I am pointing to have been stored by right clicking in the Charles Sequence list and choosing Save Response....p  pHowever when testing this with my iOS app I get the following error messagep  precodeFailed to get areas Error DomainAFNetworkingErrorDomain Code1016 Expected content type      textjson,     applicationjson,     textjavascript , got textplain  codepre  pSo somehow I am not sending the response with the correct header information for Content type. Is there a way of telling Charles that the response is JSON A possible problem is that the files stored only contains the JSON data and not any header.p

So my raw SQL looks likep  precodeselect distinct statealpha,statenumeric from locationcode order by statealpha codepre  pI will have to do this several times throughout all of my application.  The table is also read only  the user will never insert or update it.  I will eventually have similar queries  pulling from the same table  thatll return counties in a state, cities in a county, etc.p  pSo my 1st question is Should I create a model for something like this  Im worried because I have no idea how the model works underneath the covers, and I dont want it needlessly reading from the table or prepping it to be written to or something else.p  pMy next question  Barring your answer of my 1st question, could you please provide a basic example of how Id accomplish this.p  pSorry if I sound really stupid, but its not like the documentation for Laravel is really that inclussive  it says what it needs to allow you to use it, but it doesnt cover how it works very well  so much of this is magic to me.p

For deterministic games like chess, its possible in theory to work out all the possible moves that lead to a win state and work backwards, selecting the best moves that keep leading towards that outcome.

Negative 980 pThere is probably a very simple answer to this question but Id like to know the best practice for handling this type of scenario. Running MVC4, I have a page that performs a redirects to a Controller action that performs a lookup and dynamically renders content on another page.p  pThe page makes a call to the following controller for the lookupp  precode    public ActionResult GetMembershipLevelstring userid             var memberDetails  MemberDetails.GetMembershipDetailsuserid        TempData[MemberDetails]  memberDetails        var memberLevel  memberDetails.MemberLevel        switch memberLevel                    case 0                return RedirectToActionBasic            case 1                return RedirectToActionGold            case 2                return RedirectToActionPlatinum                return null      codepre  pAfter the lookup, based on the Members details the data is stored in the TempData object and Redirected to an ActionResult within the same controller to provide the model data that get sent to 1 of potentially 3 views. I did this because each view will render a different set of the Model based on Member classificationsp  precode    public ActionResult Basic              var details  MembershipDetailTempData[MemberDetails]         ViewBag.Member  details.IndividualName         return Viewtuple      codepre  pIn this code snippet, the Model is returned to a View called Basic and all this works fine. Except in the case that a manual refresh is made within the Browser. Then all Hell breaks out with the notorious Object Not Set To an Instance Of an Object at the line ViewBag.Artist  details.IndividualNamep  pI know the reason its happening is because a refresh of the same page cannot and does not repeat the entire cycle that landed the user on the page. It was a Redirect with the users selected Id initially and a refresh simply refreshes the existing page without the Id parameter causing the TempData to be null on subsequent refreshes.p  pI did some research and found a couple of suggestions.    1. Add modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequeststrue to the WebConfig. I ruled this out as a potential fix immediately as I dont believe it is relevant to my problem.p  ol liDecorate my Controller with the [HandleError] attribute. This actually worked and alleviated the problemli ol  pBut my question, Is this the correct and best method of handling the issuep  pI read concerning the attribute, When you provide only the HandleError attribute to your class or to your action method for that matter, then when an unhandled exception occurs MVC will look for a corresponding View named Error first in the Controllers View folder. If it cant find it there then it will proceed to look in the Shared View folder which should have an Error.aspx file in it by defaultp  pSo it leads me to believe that implementation of the [HandleError] attribute should require a corresponding View. p  pIf this is correct It seems what Ive accomplished is resolution of the issue but not much more than a comparable try catch block that doesnt implement the catch.p  pRight or Wrong Is this method acceptable under the circumstancesp

The mix of forward and reverse iteration is simply for efficiency to prevent traversing the entire list to reach a node near the end when iterating in the forward direction or the beginning when iterating in reverse.p  precodefull source httpwww.3111skyline.comdldevprgsrctestlld.c.txt compile with  gcc Wall o tlld testlld.com  void deletenode rec list, int node    test that list exists if list      fprintf stdout,s, The list is emptyn,func     return    get size of list int szlist  getszlist list   test node lt szlist if node gt szlist  node lt 0      fprintf stderr, s, Error record to delete is out of range dn, func, node     return    find the nodeth node with balanced search  search fwd for 0gtszlist2, rev endgtszlist2 if node  0  ampamp node gt szlist2      while szlist  node     list  amplistgtprev      list  amplistgtprev   hack to get correct list ptr before delete     list  amplistgtnext   when traversing list in reverse  else     while node     list  amplistgtnext   create pointer to node to delete rec victim  list   nonselfreference node means just rewire if victim  victimgtnext      victimgtprevgtnext  victimgtnext     victimgtnextgtprev  victimgtprev     list  victimgtnext  else        deleted node was selfreferenced. last node     list  NULL   free victim   delete the node  codepre  pHowever, I have run across a problem iterating in reverse where the pointer address reported upon reaching the desired node is different from the address reported for the same node when reached with forward iteration. In a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22623189ccirculardoublelinkedlisttraversesfwdrevforendnodegivesdifferentporelated post 2a, this was explained by forward iteration leaving the poitertothenodepointer on node  1 and reverse iteration leaving it pointing node  1 while both nodepointers correctly pointed to node. Im not convinced that is the case.p  pThe problem is easily seen by dumping the pointers after iterating in reverse to the wanted node, then iterating one additional step nodeprev dumping the pointers again, then stepping back to the wanted node in the forward direction nodenext and dumping the pointers again. The address reported for the node changes. Here is an example for node 30p  precodelist pointer state after reverse iteration to node 30 29  prev 0x605070  cur 0x605100  next 0x605078 30  prev 0x605100  cur 0x605190  next 0x605108 31  prev 0x605190  cur 0x605108  next 0x605198  list pointer state after next step to node 29 28  prev 0x604fe0  cur 0x605070  next 0x604fe8 29  prev 0x605070  cur 0x605100  next 0x605078 30  prev 0x605100  cur 0x605078  next 0x605108  list pointer state after forward step to node 30 29  prev 0x605070  cur 0x605100  next 0x605078 30  prev 0x605100  cur 0x605078  next 0x605108 31  prev 0x605190  cur 0x605108  next 0x605198 codepre  pI do not get it In the first block of 3 above, the list pointer for node 30 reached iterating in reverse reports its address as codecur 0x605190code. This looks broken, like there is some problem with the code, but there isnt. Something is wrong however, because codenode 30 cur  node 29 nextcode. Continuing one more step in reverse codelist  amplistgtprevcode gives the next block of addresses and the list pointer address has changed to codecur 0x605078code. Huh However, you can see the problem continues in reverse iteration by looking at the addresses for now nodes 29 amp 28. The same issue that was a problem for node 30, now exists at node 29 by virture of the additional stepprev.p  pNow moving back to node 30 with codelist  amplistgtnextcode allows node 30 to be deleted using address code0x605078code and everything works fine. But I cannot get my head around why I cant just iterate to node 30 in reverse and have the delete work Why does interating in reverse give a different address for node 30 code0x605190code than if reaching it from the forward direction code0x605078code.p  pLastly, after the prev,next steps, you can see the same type of problem between codenode 30 cur 0x605078code and codenode 31 prev 0x605190code. Huh and that is the address originally reported for node 30 when reached iterating in reverse What is going on herep  pThe full a hrefhttpwww.3111skyline.comdldevprgsrctestlld.c.txt relnofollowsource codea is available. Simply compile with codegcc Wall o tlld testlld.comcode. The code creates a 50 node linkedlist to operate on. You can force the list to delete all nodes as a test with code.tlld 49..0code.p
Negative 980 pIm currently working on a game that relies heavily on physics, that will determine if the player has lost. The game is working great most of the time but every once in awhile the physics plays out differently on one device from the other. The way it works is a person moves the piece and places it where they would like. The game then saves the state of all the pieces and ends the turn before the physics play out. This state is transferred to the other player so both players can see the turn actually take place. I would think that if every node is in the exact same position the physics would play out the same on both devices. Like I said they are very similar but sometimes they are different enough to create a false game over detection. Is there something I can do to make sure they are the same or a better way of sending the state between turnsp

Negative 980 pWhile building large applications with meteor, we do face the regular problem of editing the stylesheets files. Once a file is edited, the whole application reloads which takes time each time a little change is made. A large project implicitly implies complex css files.

What Im looking for is a workflow where I can change the .scss files in an editor and watch the result in real time in my meteor app.p

Negative 980 pI apologize if this has been asked already but I cant find online the right way to get this thing to work.p  pI have a cmake project Foo which depends on another cmake project Bar. Goal whenever Bar is reinstalled changing only the libraries, not the headers, then Foo should relink without rebuilding, of course.p  pSo, in the CMakeLists.txt in the top folder of project Foo which has only one target, an executable I have the cmake commandp  precodeFINDPACKAGEBar REQUIRED codepre  pWhich, correctly, finds project Bar at configure time. In the part where I create the target, I havep  precodeLINKDIRECTORIES BARLIBRARYDIRS  ADDEXECUTABLEfoo.exe main.cpp TARGETLINKLIBRARIESfoo.exe BARLIBRARIES codepre  pThe two variables in there are defined in BarConfig.cmake, which is the one that codeFINDPACKAGEBarcode looks for, and contains only the following instructionsp  precodeSETBARINCLUDEDIRS CMAKECURRENTLISTDIR......include SETBARLIBRARYDIRS CMAKECURRENTLISTDIR......lib SETBARLIBRARIES bar codepre  pI printed on screen those variables and they contain what you expect them to contain pathtofolderinclude, pathtofolderlib and bar.p  pSo, I read somewhere that cmake cannot add a dependency to a library which is not specified with its complete path. One should writep  precodeTARGETLINKLIBRARIES foo.exe fullpathtobarlibraries codepre  pIn that case, it works. But its unsatisfactory. First, cause the path can change. But you can read it from a variable, you might say. True. But, second, even in that case, if the project Bar contains a number of libraries that is not known, one would have to sweat to create the correct string to add there...p  pHowever, I also read that if that library is also built and installed with cmake, it should work automatically. As a matter of fact, I have another project pair, A depends on B, both built with cmake. In that case the dependence works. Unfortunately, the project B is HUGE, and defines TONS of cmake macros, and I cant identify the part where it sets up the right variables.p  pDo you have any idea of how to get Foo to relink without rebuilding every time that the library Bar is reinstalled I would like to avoid to use full path.p  pThanksp  pEdit to be more clear if library Bar set up a variable BARLIBRARIES containing all its libraries with the full path, then TARGETLINKLIBRARIES would work. However, most likely BARLIBRARIES would contain bar, rather than somepathlibbar.a. Id like cmake to be able, given the directories provided with LINKDIRECTORIES and the library names provided with TARGETLINKLIBRARIES to put the two pieces together. E.g. if BARLIBRARYDIRS contains folder1folder2 and BARLIBRARIES contains bar1bar2, Id like cmake to establish a dependency on libbar1.a and libbar2.a, found in any of the followingp  ol lifolder1libbar1.ali lifolder2libbar1.ali lifolder1libbar2.ali lifolder2libbar2.ali ol  pAnd relink if any of the ones upon which a dependency has been created is changed since the last linking.p

Negative 980 pIve been trying to get an extremely minimal web page using Polymer to simply render in the browser  Im using a NodeExpressJSJade setup on the serverside of things. My code is as close as it gets to the examples that ship with the Polymer documentation, I think Im missing something really simple. Im using Chrome M35.p  pOn the server, I have installed all the Polymer stuff platform, core and paper using bower and Ive mapped codebowercomponentscode to be served statically under codestaticcodep  precodeapp.usestatic, express.staticpath.joinprocess.cwd, bowercomponents codepre  pIve verified that my server can correctly serve resources such as codehttplocalhost3000staticpaperbuttonpaperbutton.htmlcode  this returns the content of the desired file.p  pThe HTML served by the page is as suchp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt   ltheadgt     ltmeta charsetutf8gt     ltscript srcstaticplatformplatform.jsgtltscriptgt     lttitlegtAuthenticatelttitlegt     ltlink relimport srcstaticpaperbuttonpaperbutton.htmlgt     ltstylegt       body          fontfamily Helvetica Neue         margin 0         padding 24px         userselect none         transform translateZ0               paperbutton          margin 1em         width 10em               paperbutton.colored          color 4285f4         fill 4285f4             ltstylegt   ltheadgt   ltbodygt     ltpaperbutton labelAuthenticate classcoloredgtltpaperbuttongt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pThis is as close as it gets to the example for the same widget as documented on the a hrefhttpwww.polymerproject.orgcomponentspaperbuttondemo.html relnofollowPolymer websitea. In my case, nothing renders. The really odd thing is what is shown in the Network tab of the inspectorp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFjOTc.png altPolymer Web Inspectorp  pThere is a codeLoader.jscode script, which I believe gets installed by codeplatform.jscode, which sends an XHR for the root page itself the 3rd line. In every other example I see, that loading script starts loading the imported web components. I just cant figure out why its doing this in my case. The other odd thing is the call originating from codeParser.jscode  the requested data URL is codedatatextjavascriptbase64,Ci8vIyBzb3VyY2VVUkw9bnVsbC9bMTQ1M10uanMKcode, which translates to code sourceURLnull[1453].jscode  again, not a very good sign.p  pIve tried to use relative codesrccodes in my links  to no avail.

Negative 980 pIve been playing with some examples from Simon Marlows book about parallel and concurrent programming in Haskell and stumbled across an interesting behavior that I dont really understand. This is really about me trying to understand some of the inner workings of GHC.p  pLets say I do the following in the REPLp  precode let x  1  2  Int  let z  x,x  sprint x x    sprint z z  ,  seq x    sprint z z  3,3 codepre  pOk, this is pretty much what I expected except that z gets evaluated to WHNF already. Lets write a similar program and put it in a filep  precodemodule Thunk where  import Debug.Trace  x  Int x  trace add  1  2  z  Int,Int z  x,x codepre  pAnd fiddle around with it in GHCip  precode sprint x x    sprint z z    seq x  add   sprint z z    seq z    z 3,3 codepre  pSo this behaves a little different codezcode is not evaluated to WHNF in advance. My question isp  pWhy is codezcode evaluated to WHNF in the REPL when doing codelet z  x,xcode but not when loading the definition from a file. My suspicion is that it has something to do with pattern binding but I dont know where to look that up for clarification maybe Im just completely utterly wrong. I would have expected it to somehow behave like the example in the file.p  pAny pointers or a brief explanation why this happensp

Negative 980 pIve recently begun conducting content experiments on my website. Im running a basic AB, comparing an original template with a new template for certain page types. For some of the experiments, there are more total bounces being recorded than experiment sessions. p  pFor example, see this screencast a hrefhttpscreencast.comtfLhVN88w81U relnofollowhttpscreencast.comtfLhVN88w81Uap  pYou can see in the table that bounces are higher than sessions, and therefore a bounce rate is being reported of higher than 100. The line graph above the table is also telling. Ive run several other experiments, and this is not a widespread occurrence. It only appears to happen when the total number of experiment sessions is less than 2,500. Is this just a figment of small sample sizesp  pThanksp

Negative 980 pI have a rather large sqlite database where one column is a varchar, but takes only a few values basically enum. Since the database file is already a few GB and is growing, I started refactoring the column to hold ids basically foreign keys from another table where the few varchars went.p  pIt occured to me that maybe the effort is futile maybe sqlite handles the situation intelligently, as opposed to naively storing each varchar along all the others.p  pSo the question is how does sqlite handle representation of repeating varchar values in a column, and will converting from varchars to ids cut the db file sizep

Negative 980 pSay you have an equation codeSUMC32AC32AD53code where strong32strong is always going to be the row number. Id like to write this as equation I can just copy it to each cell as is, rather than having to update the row number each time I paste it to a different row.

To show all blog posts by the current user, it queries all blog posts with the codeusercode field set to the current user. p  pBut since the codeUsercode table by default is read only to all users, wouldnt this be problematic that a malicious user codeXcode can create random posts and claim that they are create by another user codeYcode, by setting the codeusercode field of those posts to codeYcode as he queries from the codeUsercode table So the consequence would be that when the system shows posts for user codeYcode, he would see all his true posts in addition to the post that was forged by codeXcode. p  pIs the mitigation that the codeUsercode table needs to be ACLd somehow But if it is the solution, then why is the default behavior that an arbitrary user can see the entire codeUsercode tablep

Negative 980 pRecently, Ive been tasked with creating automation for a .NET software Audio Precision APx500. My companys automation is based around Python and Robot Framework. Since Python has no inherent .NET support, my primary option is as follows create a script using IronPython that interfaces with the APx500 API, compile this to an exe, and talk to that exe over a socket.p  pThe client would be the python lib that I would import in RF. Methods in this lib would send a message over the socket to the server the ipy exe, which would interpret the message and run a particular function of the APx500 API.p  pThe problem lies in my lack of understanding of how to configure the socket serverside. I dont know how to properly receive and interpret messages sent from the client.p  pSay I do something likep  precodedef startAPself      self.sock.sendopen APx500 codepre  pHow would the server interpret this to execute the correct task p  pIf there are better ways to do what Im attempting, please, let me know.p

However, it is called both before and after shouldAutorotate is called. Why is this happening and what is the solution for managing auto rotation in iOS 8p  pWhile I have seen many SO problems addressing auto rotation issues in previous iOS versions with the most thorough description of how to set up to manage autorotation found in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12260261shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientationnotbeingcalledinios6shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation not being called in iOS 6a, none seem to address the problem of supportedInterfaceOrientations being called even though shouldAutoRotate  NO and the view still rotating even though it is being told not to rotate.p  pTo be completely thorough with my explanation, here is a description of how I have set this upp  pFirst, to get the Launch Images to display, I was forced to set the device orientation in the info.plist to support all orientations.

Negative 980 pI have a WCF service, exposing a ServiceContract with basicHttpBinding, so from my understanding strongInstanceContextModestrong will be set to PerCall as basicHttpBinding doesnt support sessions and ConcurrenyMode will be set to Single. p  pThe client of this WCF is a windows service, which invokes 4 different operations on the service at the same time, within the service we have used a singleton class and there are few Static variables. We have been facing a problem where in a wrong value is getting passed to some of the DB Stored Procedures. p  pWith PerCall InstanceContextMode and Single concurrency mode, i understand a new service instacne in created for every call and hence i am thinking that even though there are some singleton classes we have not made it thread safe in the service implementation and static variables all the objects  will be destroyed, but we have observed running a SQL profiler that on old value is getting passed the DB.p  pWe have written our WCF service code in a kind of 3tier architecture, i mean ServiceClass, BusinessLogicLayer and DataAccessLayer, with PerCall set as instanceContextMode when we say the service instance is destroyed after the client request is finished, does it mean we destroy all the object in ServiceClass,BusinessLogicLayer and DataAccessLayer p  pPls help me understand what could be going wrong  p

Negative 980 pOkay so I have a question regarding building a dynamic UI with Fragments. Been working through the developer documents of Android and I have a question which I cannot seem to find an answer to or dont know how to search for it.p  pI want to create a fragment at runtime, so from what I read I need to have a FrameLayout which will act as my container for my fragment that I want to add. For this to work I need to at compile time define the fragments that will be active during my application that I want to swap in and out of. But here is my question, what if I dont know what these fragments will look like at compile time What if I want to dynamically change the way they look at runtimep  pSo basically what I want to be able to do is load a fragment and then in the onCreateView define which UI elements it needs to display text views, edit texts and radio buttons, I then want to press a button and load another fragment replacing the current one where I then again in the onCreateView define which UI elements I want to display. But upon navigating to the next fragment I want to add the current one with the custom UI elements I just added, to the backstack so that the user can navigate back to it later. I want to navigate through about 10 or more of these custom UI elements fragments, saving all the previous ones to a back stack.p  pCan this be done using fragments From what I can see I need to define the Fragment.java file which the activity loads at compile time, which means that I need to have predefined ones before I start How then do I do what I want to achievep  pSo I guess part of what I want to know is can I create Fragments dynamically at runtime and not at compile time I dont just want to load different already created Fragments, I actually want to create them once the app is already running, give them a custom interface by adding UI elements after I create them and then be able to add those to the back stack to navigate back to later.p  pI really hope this makes sense.p  pThanks, Wihanp

Negative 980 pI am learning Microsoft PRISM toolkit in order to implement a tabbed modular application.  I examined core terms such as codeRegioncode, codeModulecode, codeBootstrappercode, codeShellcode, codeContainercode on basic basis. I can create modules and load into specified regions. And I use constructor injection to get registered types or instances to the container. But I have a problem implementing TabItem inside a TabControl for each module to be loaded. What I would like to do is an app consisting of two main region in the right and left side like in the picture. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlNTWy.png altenter image description here There will be module names in a stackpanel in the left region. The right region has a TabControl in which called modules is shown inside TabItems. With every mouse double click on module names in the left region, a new tab item will be added into Tab Control in the right region if specified module did not exist there. If called module exists in TabControl, it will be active. Tab items have a close button like internet browser tabs.  On clicking the close button of tab, it will be closed with the module. In fact, I want to unload a module with doing this but, I encountered with this note while browsing Microsofts Prism 5 for WPF documentationp  precode After a module is loaded and initialized, the module assembly cannot be unloaded. The module  instance reference will not be held by the Prism libraries, so the module class instance may be garbage  collected after initialization is complete. codepre  pIn this case I will only hide the module region inside a TabItem removing it from TabControl. But I cannot find an approach to do this. Should I create a Module Tracker class which track info about which module is loaded and exists in Tab or another way FYI I use Unity as a bootstrapper.p

The current code that I have will delete the list of radio buttons, but when the next line is added, nothing happens including list deletion.p  pPHP delCom.phpp  precode                ltphp                     includeonceincludesconn.inc.php                     query  SELECT comicID, comicName  FROM comic WHERE username  .SESSION[username].                     result  mysqliqueryconn, query                     while row  resultgtfetchassoc                                               echo ltbrgtltinput namecomicList id.row[comicID]. typeradio value.row[comicID].gt.row[comicName].  ltoptiongt                                      gt codepre  pJavaScriptp  precodefunction delComic                      var ajaxRequest                try                               Opera 8.0, Firefox, Safari                 ajaxRequest  new XMLHttpRequest                           catch e                               Internet Explorer Browsers                 try                                      ajaxRequest  new ActiveXObjectMsxml2.XMLHTTP                                   catch e                                       try                                              ajaxRequest  new ActiveXObjectMicrosoft.XMLHTTP                                           catch e                                               Something went wrong                         alertYour browser broke                         return false                                                                 Create a function that will receive data sent from the server             ajaxRequest.onreadystatechange  function                              ifajaxRequest.readyState  4                                      loadList.remove                     document.getElementByIddivComics.innerHTMLxmlhttp.responseText                                           ajaxRequest.openGET, delCom.phpt, true             ajaxRequest.sendnull            codepre  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv iddivComicsgt             ltpgtltugtUploaded Comicsltugtltpgt             lt find comics in database gt             ltdiv idloadListgt                 ltphp                     includeonceincludesconn.inc.php                     query  SELECT comicID, comicName  FROM comic WHERE username  .SESSION[username].

Negative 980 pI am writing a small Spring 4 MVC app.  Im new to it and thought I might try and get some advice about a point apologies Ive been looking at javespring for a couple of months now and I have a mixed level of unconsolidated knowledge which leaves me wildly fluctuating between jargon and lack of understanding.  p  pI am adding a header jsp or jspf to all the pages jsps.  At this early stage I am adding them with a  tag as the includeprelude stopped working at some point although I may go back and sort this out if I get time.  I dont think that is relevant though...p  pIn the header.jsp I just want to include a logo, title, link to a help pdf and the date the underlying data was last updated ideally updated once a day.  This last has got me thinking...p  pFirstly is it reasonable to include data in a header  And if it is presumably it makes more sense to call the date once and store it somewhere in the application It is not mission critical that it refreshes if it changes but Im sure there are reasonable ways to do this which ever way it goes.p  pSecondly, if it is reasonable, what would be the best way of doing this   Would I create a bean with one property and fill the date on application load I could call it appConfig and add more properties if they are needed I guess.  p  pThirdly, If this is reasonable then, and I have a horrible feeling this is a complete numpty question..., how would I access this objectdata from the header. Or should I give up and just add it as a dependency injected field into the home page and give up putting it in the header.p  pThanks if anyone does have time to help...p

Im also not able to drag a navigation bar to the top of the table view controller. Am I doing something wrong Thanks. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJqW4r.png altenter image description herep
Negative 980 pI have some data that I am getting from a server and then displaying in my UIViewController class. To do this, I have two classes. The UIViewController and another one named ServerCommunicator. UIViewController is the delegate for ServerCommunicator class. The serverCommunicator looks as followsp  precode   voidfetchServerDataNSString  serverAddress      NSURL url  [[NSURL alloc] initWithStringserverAddress]      [NSURLConnection sendAsynchronousRequest[[NSURLRequest alloc] initWithURLurl] queue[[NSOperationQueue alloc] init] completionHandlerNSURLResponse response, NSData data, NSError error           if error              [self.delegate fetchingSongsFailedWithErrorerror]          else              [self.delegate receivedSongsJSONdata]              ]  codepre  pThe UIViewController allocates the serverCommunicator, sets itself as delegate and then issue the fetch request. p  precode  voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      self.songServerCommunicator  [[serverCommunicator alloc] init]     self.songServerCommunicator.delegate  self     [self.songServerCommunicator fetchServerDataltsomeserveripgt]   codepre  pAfter it does that it implements the required protocol methodp  precode voidreceivedSongsJSONNSData data          NSLogreceived server response          Parses the data and displays in textfieldimageview    codepre  pMy problem is that when I do display the data received in the delegate method, it doesnt get reflected right away in the UI. It is very weird, sometimes it gets shown 20 seconds laters on its own, other times it takes like a minute. I am not sure whats going on. I know for a fact that the data was fetched right away because the logged message gets printed way before the UIView gets updated. p  pThanks for any help on this.  p
Negative 980 pIm seeing this a number of TwitterClient sessions become expired and it results in an exception. From the best I can tell the twitter oAuth session isnt suppose to expire so Im wondering what might be causing this issue I am using memcache to store user sessions because our site scales across many instances which might factor into the matter but I was seeing this behavior before moving to memcache so I believe this might be from something else.p  pIdeally I am looking for ideas on what might be causing this so I can fix it but in the short term I would be grateful if anyone could tell me how to intercept this exception and handle it so my users arent seeing an error screen.p  pI am

I need any writeread calls to the socket to be synchronous blocking.p  pI know there is codewaitForReadyReadcode and codewaitForBytesWrittencode, but those two methods are marked in Qt documentation as they can fail randomly under Windows. I cannot affort this.p  pThe blocking read is the most important as reading comes always after writting a command to the other peer, so I know that if data reaches the other peer, it will answer.p  pI have tried 2 approaches.p  pstrongFirststrongp  precodeQByteArray readBytesqint64 count      int sleepIterations  0     QByteArray resultBytes     while resultBytes.size lt count ampamp sleepIterations lt 100              if socketgtbytesAvailable  0                      sleepIterations             QThreadmsleep100             QCoreApplicationprocessEventsQEventLoopExcludeUserInputEvents             continue                   resultBytes  socketgtreadqMincount, socketgtbytesAvailable          return resultBytes  codepre  pThis should wait for bytes to be available for reading on the socket, processing the event loop in the mean time, so the socket is doing its necessary internal stuff.p  pUnfortunately  for unknown to me reason  the codebytesAvailablecode sometimes returns correct number of bytes, but sometimes it never returns anything greater than 0.p  pI know in fact that there was data to be read, because it used to work with the second approach but it has its own problems.p  pstrongSecondstrongp  pI have a kind of signal blocker, which blocks current context and processes event loop, until certain signal is emitted. This is the blockerp  pSignalWait.hp  precodeclass SignalWait  public QObject          QOBJECT      public         SignalWaitQObject object, const char signal          bool waitint msTimeout      private         bool called  false      private slots         void handleSignal  codepre  pSignalWait.cppp  precodeSignalWaitSignalWaitQObject object, const char signal      QObject      connectobject, signal, this, SLOThandleSignal   bool SignalWaitwaitint msTimeout      QTime timer0, 0, 0, msTimeout     timer.start     while called ampamp timer.elapsed lt msTimeout         QCoreApplicationprocessEventsQEventLoopExcludeUserInputEvents      return called   void SignalWaithandleSignal      called  true  codepre  pand then I used it like thisp  precodeSignalWait signalWaitsocket, SIGNALreadyRead  ...  socketgtwrite...  ... if signalWait.wait30000       error     return  bytes  socketgtreadsize codepre  pThis approach seems to be working better, but it also fails from time to time.

Negative 980 pI would like to extend powershell so that it supports wider range of commands including support for running a command that matches an executable name in the system.

Negative 980 pSo I have a group of text files that, when one is chosen, is parsed and turned into a table for viewing.p  pIm trying to then highlight row or rows that match a selection or group of selection from any of 5 dropdowns. These dropdowns are created from columns in the table.p  pMy issue is that once selected, if there is a match in a row or rows, those rows would be highlighted. My PHP logic is completely flawed for the selection part the parsing and displaying of the table and the dropdwn creation works just fine.p  pHow do I create the logic for selecting the rows after creating the table and the dropdownsp  pThank you all in advance the code I have so farp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt  lthtmlgt     ltheadgt         ltmeta charsetUTF8gt         lttitlegtResultslttitlegt

Negative 980 pWe are working on the application that consists of many standalone services. It has advantages over the single monolithic application, but not when we do releases.p  pWe do weekly release cycles. Each servicecomponent located in the separate git repository. A release  is several features that we put into wild. Usually only several components should be updated. We manage servers using saltstack. To make a release salt scripts update components versions using git.latest state. The problem is to specify right versions.p  pThis is where the manual work that Id like to automate. To update versions I have to manually check each components repository, merge development branch into master and tag according to symantec versioning rules. Then I write new version in salt scripts. We have over 10 components so this is rather boring and error prone process.p  pProbably we doing it wrong, Ill be glad to hear any advices how to do it better, thanks.p
Negative 980 pIm given a series of cities, and each one produces an amount of electricity and needs an amount of electricity. Each city has up to 8 adjacent cities, and I am trying to minimize the number of transfers. If AB 10 energy, total cost of transfer is 10. If ABC 10 energy A to C through B, total cost of transfer is 20. I thought about using Djikstras on each point that needs energy, and ending the search for that point when enough energy has been found, but thought of several pitfalls. I was wondering what else I could consider that could potentially work I also considered looking into the FloydWarshall algorithm as well as the Hagerup read a bit about them on wikipedia and they seemed potentially viablep  pThanksp

Negative 980 pAs I know in strongcppstrong, when we delete an object or when the main finishes, the destructors of all objects will be called. For those objects whose type are class child, the destructors of class child will be called first then the distructors of class parent will be called.br Now I am confused. Because if a pure virtual destructor is allowed, how could it be called when we delete an object of class child Doesnt it call the destructor of class parent which is pure virtualp

Negative 980 pI have a JSON input whose objects are all derived from a base class along the lines of thisp  precodepublic abstract class Base      public Base Parent  get set   codepre  pIm trying to create a codeCustomCreationConvertercode to set the codeParentcode property of each object to the parent node in the JSON input using codeReadJsoncode except for the root node, of course. Is this possible Id rather not have to traverse the objects after creation to set the codeParentcode property.p  h1Example Timeh1  pSay I have this input JSONp  precode   Name Joe,   Children [      Name Sam, FavouriteToy Car ,      Name Tom, FavouriteToy Gun ,   ]  codepre  pI have the following two classesp  precodepublic class Person      public Person Parent  get set      public string Name  get set      public ListltChildgt Children  get set    public class Child  Person      public string FavouriteToy  get set   codepre  pThe codeNamecode and codeFavouriteToycode properties deserialise fine, but I want to have the codeParentcode property of any codePersoncode object set to, as youd expect, the actual parent object within the JSON input presumably using a codeJsonConvertercode. The best Ive been able to implement so far is recursively traversing each object after deserialisation and setting the codeParentcode property that way.p  h1P.S.h1  pI want to point out that I know Im able to do this with references inside the JSON itself, but Id rather avoid that.p  h1Not a duplicate h1  pThat question refers to creating an instance of the correct derived class, the issue Im having is finding a way to get context during the deserialisation of the objects. Im trying to use a JsonConverters ReadJson method to set a property of a deserialised object to refer to another object within the same JSON input, emwithoutem using coderefcodes.p

Negative 980 pI have a Google calendar for a store. The store has irregular hours that are subject to change, and therefore need to be displayed in real time. I cannot constantly change the hours in JavaScript for the owner, and the owner refuses to do any coding he can only use Google calendar to manipulate the store hours. Also, the owner does not want an iframe of the Google calendar to be displayed on his website, just the data. p  pThe solution When the store is opened, have a calendar event. If the store is closed, display no calendar events on the day. This means that if the hours change, all the owner has to do is add, remove, or edit the events on the calendar. p  pI have already put together a code that pulls freebusy information from a Google calendar. p  precodeltphp  datedefaulttimezonesetGMT   request  array     items gt array         arrayid gt REMOVED FOR SECURITY,     ,      timeMin gt datec,      timeMax gt datec, strtotime2 month,   curl  curlinit   options  array     CURLOPTCONNECTTIMEOUT gt 5,     CURLOPTFOLLOWLOCATION gt true,     CURLOPTHEADER         gt false,     CURLOPTRETURNTRANSFER gt true,     CURLOPTSSLVERIFYPEER gt false,     CURLOPTTIMEOUT        gt 10,     CURLOPTPOST           gt true,     CURLOPTPOSTFIELDS     gt jsonencoderequest,     CURLOPTHTTPHEADER     gt array         ContentType applicationjson,         ContentLength  . strlenjsonencoderequest     ,     CURLOPTURL            gt httpswww.googleapis.comcalendarv3freeBusyfieldscalendarsampkeyREMOVED FOR SECURITY,     CURLOPTUSERAGENT      gt Mozilla5.0 Macintosh Intel Mac OS X 10.10 rv36.0 Gecko20100101 Firefox36.0,  curlsetoptarraycurl, options  result  curlexeccurl curlclosecurl  echo result gt codepre  pIve then gone and used JavaScript to parse the data so that it displays from the 2 months worth of data its pulling the next seven days and their hours to look like br br  72 1100  1400 br  76 1100  1400 br  77 1100  1400 br  78 1100  1400 br  79 1100  1400 br  713 1100  1400 br  714 1100  1400 br p  pIf you go on the Google calendar and adddeleteedit any of those seven events, it automatically changes on the website.

Negative 980 pI am currently working on a PacMan remake in Java, and I am having a problem with player movement. I use a KeyListener to detect when the W A S or D keys are pressed, and sets a variable as true or false. The variables are up, down, left, right. This works fine, but the tick method does not recognize the value change, almost as if there are two variables. For example, I will press the W key and up is set to true. In the tick method, however, up is not true. This also happens when getting the position of the player. It will only get the first position of the player, but after I edit the position in the KeyListener method, the tick method will not recognize that the position has been changed. p  pI have also found that when I move the position directly from the KeyListener method and print it to the console, it works correctly. But when I print the position from the tick method, it always prints the original position. If I print both, it seems as if there are two variables, because the KeyListener method will always print the correct value, and the tick method will always print the original, but does not reset the KeyListener value.p  pSorry if this sounds confusing, please ask if you need me to describe it in a different way.p  pAnyway, the tick method is being called 60 times every second.p  pCan someone please help me fix this problem Help is appreciated.p  pHere is the class for the Player, containing the tick and KeyListener methods.p  precodepackage com.graysullivan.entities  import java.awt.Graphics2D import java.awt.Point import java.awt.Rectangle import java.awt.event.KeyEvent import java.awt.event.KeyListener import java.awt.image.BufferedImage import java.util.ArrayList  import com.graysullivan.main.Location  public class Player implements KeyListener   Location pos private int width  80 private int height  80 private boolean up, down, left, right  public Player      pos  new Location360, 701   public void init    public void tickdouble deltaTime  System.out.printlnpos.y     ifup          System.out.printlnup         pos.y            ifdown          pos.y           ifleft          pos.x           ifright          pos.x        public void renderGraphics2D g      g.fillRectintpos.x,intpos.y, 40, 40   Override public void keyPressedKeyEvent e      int key  e.getKeyCode      ifkey  KeyEvent.VKW          up  true         System.out.printlnup           ifkey  KeyEvent.VKS          down  true           ifkey  KeyEvent.VKA          left  true           ifkey  KeyEvent.VKD          right  true           ifkey  KeyEvent.VKDELETE          System.exit0         Override public void keyReleasedKeyEvent e      int key  e.getKeyCode      ifkey  KeyEvent.VKW          up  false           ifkey  KeyEvent.VKS          down  false           ifkey  KeyEvent.VKA          left  false           ifkey  KeyEvent.VKD          right  false        Override public void keyTypedKeyEvent e    codepre

Negative 980 pIm looking for recommendations as to the best way forward for my current machine learning problemp  pThe outline of the problem and what Ive done is as followsp  ul liI have 900 trials of EEG data, where each trial is 1 second long. The ground truth is known for each and classifies state 0 and state 1 4060 splitli liEach trial goes through preprocessing where I filter and extract power of certain frequency bands, and these make up a set of features feature matrix 913x32li liThen I use sklearn to train the model. crossvalidation is used where I use a test size of 0.2. Classifier is set to SVC with rbf kernel, C  1, gamma  1 Ive tried a number of different valuesli ul  pYou can find a shortened version of the code here a hrefhttppastebin.comXu13ciL4 relnofollowhttppastebin.comXu13ciL4ap  pMy issuesp  ul liWhen I use the classifier to predict labels for my test set, every prediction is 0li litrain accuracy is 1, while test set accuracy is around 0.56li limy learning curve plot looks like thisli ul  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comlkUnN.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlkUnN.png altenter image description hereap  pNow, this seems like a classic case of overfitting here. However, overfitting here is unlikely to be caused by a disproportionate number of features to samples 32 features, 900 samples. Ive tried a number of things to alleviate this problemp  ul liIve tried using dimensionality reduction PCA in case it is because I have too many features for the number of samples, but accuracy scores and learning curve plot looks the same as above. Unless I set the number of components to below 10, at which point train accuracy begins to drop, but is this not somewhat expected given youre beginning to lose informationli liI have tried normalizing and standardizing the data. Standardizing SD  1 does nothing to change train or accuracy scores. Normalizing 01 drops my training accuracy to 0.6.li liIve tried a variety of C and gamma settings for SVC, but they dont change either scoreli liTried using other estimators like GaussianNB, even ensemble methods like adaboost. No changeli liTried explcitly setting a regularization method using linearSVC but didnt improve the situationli liI tried running the same features through a neural net using theano and my train accuracy is around 0.6, test is around 0.5li ul  pIm happy to keep thinking about the problem but at this point Im looking for a nudge in the right direction. Where might my problem be and what could I do to solve itp  pIts entirely possible that my set of features just dont distinguish between the 2 categories, but Id like to try some other options before jumping to this conclusion. Furthermore, if my features dont distinguish then that would explain the low test set scores, but how do you get a perfect training set score in that case Is that possiblep

Negative 980 pIm doing some POC work with Redshift, loading data via S3 json files, using the copy command from a Java program.  This POC is testing an initial data migration that wed do to seed Redshift, not daily use.  My data is split into about 7500 subfolders in S3, and Id like to be able to insert the subfolders in parallel. Each subfolder contains about 250 json files, with about 3000 rows each to insert. p  pThe single threaded version of my class loads files from one of my s3 subfolders in about 20 seconds via a copy command.  However, when I introduce a second thread each thread gets a redshift db connection from a BoneCP connection pool, each copy command, except for the 1st one, takes about 40 seconds.  When I run a query in Redshift to show all running queries, Redshift says that its running two queries at the same time as expected.  However, its as if the 2nd query is really waiting for the 1st to complete before it starts work.  I expected that each copy command would still take only 20 seconds each.  The Redshift console shows that I only get up to 60 CPU usage running single or double threaded.p  pCould this be because I only have 1 node in my Redshift cluster  Or is Redshift unable to open multiple connections to S3 to get the data  Id appreciate any tips for how to get some performance gains by running multithreaded copy commands.p
Negative 980 pIm developing a Java based REST web application that uses Jersey, Tomcat 8.0 as servlet and SQLServer 2008 as database.

The security restrictions and user roles seems to be working fine and the login form is being displayed correctly.p  pThe problem is in the user authentication in my SQLServer users table. When I call codeHttpServletRequest.loginusername, passwordcode, my SQLServer JDBC driver performs the connection to the database correctly but throws a SQLServerException complaining about an error in the query syntax. Does anyone knows what might be the issue, or at least how can I see the query that the driver is trying to send to the SQLServer The access to the database using the SQLServer driver for java works perfectly fine on all other areas of the application.p

Negative 980 pIve tried few workarounds, but still I cant pause existing particles on iOS9. I am using following technique to pause the scenep  ul lipause the scene with codeself.paused  YEScodeli liset custom codeglobalPause  YEScode variable to control codeupdatecode method execution because codeupdatecode still runs while scene is paused.li ul  pThe point is that I dont pause the view, but rather the scene. I dont pause the view, because of a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq314712883402095thisa. p  pHere is the code which can reproduce this issue on iOS9p  precodeimport GameScene.h  interface GameScene   property nonatomic, strongSKEmitterNode emitter  end  implementation GameScene   voiddidMoveToViewSKView view        [self addChild[self getSpaceDustEmitter]]    No need for this method though   SKEmitterNodegetSpaceDustEmitter      self.emitter   [NSKeyedUnarchiver unarchiveObjectWithFile[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResourcespacedust ofTypesks]]      self.emitter .name  emitterspacedust     self.emitter .position  CGPointMakeCGRectGetMidXself.frame,self.frame.size.height        return  self.emitter     end codepre  pSo, very simple example which works on iOS8 and not working as expected on iOS9. What happens is that even if everything looks that is paused, its not. Existing particles after unpausing move to the point where they should be if the scene was not paused. Also, it looks like that particles keep spawning too, which can produce noticeable lag when unpausing if pause was long...p  pHere is a screenshot from particle editorp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comc6JM4.pngimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comc6JM4.png altparticle editorap  pAnybody have some reasonable explanation  So far Ive tried to explicitly pause the emitterp  precodeemitterNode.paused  YES codepre  pIt didnt worked, and actually this should be done automatically when scene is paused emitter is added to the scene. Another thing which is tried is to set codeemitter.particleSpeed  0code as well as codeemitter.particleSpeedRange  0code and codeemitter.particleBirthRate  0code but this doesnt affect on already existing particles which make sense.p  pAnd thats it. Not sure if this is a bug, but I am run out of ideas... p

Negative 980 p Hello guys,p  pSo I am making a inbox element, and.. I needed to get field startDate from service, but I faced a problem, because all data in this service is deeply maped.. p  pwhat  I figured out, is p  precodeGenericTypeltMapltString, Objectgtgt responseType2  new GenericTypeltMapltString, Objectgtgt     MapltString, Objectgt data2  info.readEntityresponseType2  MapltString, Objectgt data3  MapltString, Objectgt data2.getdata  MapltString, Objectgt data4  MapltString, Objectgt data3.getworkflowInstance codepre  pAnd only after all this, I am able to get what I needed..  p  pOk, it works, but code looks very redundant p  pAnd, what I am hoping to find is, a way to make something like map in a map, or any other way, to make code more efficientp  pThanks in advance.p
Negative 980 pIm using the Voicemail Twimlet and Im receiving these automated calls that play recordings related to politics for 30 minutes or longer. The Twimlet doesnt have a time limit option that I can find, so it just records these giant mp3 files. I want to just hangup the call after 3 minutes or so. Does anyone know a way to set a time limit for a twimlet or how to create quick Twilio php script that could handle this a hrefhttpswww.twilio.comlabstwimletsvoicemail relnofollowhttpswww.twilio.comlabstwimletsvoicemailap
