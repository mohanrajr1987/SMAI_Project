Positive 11215 pIm making a simple GUI where the user can select an item from a list of Strings using the codeJListltStringgtcode component, and I want my program to update a JTextField with some data describing the selected item. I know I need an event listener, but Im confused as to what I should use to detect a change in selection in my list.p
Positive 11215 pI am building a GUI application to monitorcontrol remote embedded client devices.  Each clients state machine is maintained in a master dictionary and is to be represented in the GUI as an instance of a tab Frame in a Notebook widget.  I want to instantiate a tab defined as a class in my application whenever a new client registers and hide or forget the tab when the client link times out.  Ill reinstantiate ifwhen the client reregisters.p  pIm new to Python, Tkinter and OO in general and am struggling with program structure.  I need to continuously loop through the dictionary records to refresh the GUI, but Ive concluded I cant iterate within the root.mainloop structure.  So external changes in state machine dictionary records or elements need to refresh corresponding GUI Notebook tab instances externally, including creating and removing instances of my tab class.p  pIm confident there is a standard practice but I havent progressed sufficiently in my learning to figure this out.  Some quick suggestions to nudge me in the right direction would be appreciated.p
Positive 11215 pIve got an EventHandler, which is fired on some event. From time to time that event is blocked by Apache Felix or OSGi container itself. Is there a way to unblock that eventp  pBy blocked I mean that my event handler is not fired. Im sure that event was fired, but my event handler didnt do its logic. I assume that this is a safety feature, but maybe somehow I can change something in OSGi configuration to never block my eventsp  pCheersp

Positive 11215 pstrongIntroductionstrongp  pIm working on an application using an entity component system.  The system relies heavily on two abstract classes, Component and Processor, which share a one to one relationship.  Each Processor implements a basic Subscriber interface allowing the EventManager class to notify them when a new Event is created.p  pstrongEventsstrongp  pI have an Event abstract class which stores event type ID, like sop  precodepublic abstract class Event       public static final int NONE  0      private final int eventID      public Eventint eventID          this.eventID  eventID           public int getEventID          return eventID       codepre  pThen I have a Factory type class that extends Event, like sop  precodepublic abstract class BaseEvents extends Event       public static final int TRANSFORM  1      public BaseEventsint eventID          supereventID           public static class Transform extends BaseEvents           private final float rotation,                 tx,                 ty          public Transformfloat rotation, float tx, float ty              superTRANSFORM             this.rotation  rotation             this.tx  tx             this.ty  ty                   public float getRotation              return rotation                   public float getTx              return tx                   public float getTy          return ty                codepre  pIm trying to allow the ability to create new events simply by further extending BaseEvents.  Im using static inner classes mostly for organization. I dont want to create a separate class for every event.p  pstrongEvent Handlersstrongp  pTo avoid hardcoding handling of each Event in a given Processor Im using an EventHandler class.  My plan was to have one EventHandler class per Event.  Again Im using static inner classes for organization.p  pHeres the EventHandler abstract classp  precodepublic abstract class EventHandler       public void handleEvent event, Component component        codepre  pHeres the BaseEventHandlers Factory classp  precodepublic class BaseEventHandlers extends EventHandler       public static class Transform extends BaseEventHandlers           Override         public void handleEvent event, Component component              BaseEvents.Transform e  BaseEvents.Transform event             RenderComponent c  RenderComponent component             c.setRotatione.getRotation             c.setTxe.getTx             c.setTye.getTy                codepre  pThe example code Im showing is for a RenderComponent  RenderProcessor pairing.  We care about Transform events because they tell us where to repaint an object.p  pWhen EventManager notifies RenderProcessor of a new event, we check a Map using the Event ID to obtain the appropriate EventHandler, invoking its handle method. Note, Events are actually stored in a Processors queue and processed during an update call, like sop  precode... protected final MapltInteger, EventHandlergt eventHandlers  new HashMapltgt ...     Override     public void update          events.stream                 .forEachevent gt                      eventHandlers.getevent.getEventID.handleevent, components.getevent.getSourceEntityID                          events.clear      ... codepre  pstrongMy Problemstrongp  pIn the EventHandler, I need to cast both the Event and the Component abstract classes into appropriate concrete classes.  Im OK with being limited to one type of Event, but I cant limit myself to one type of Component.  What I want is to use Polymorphism and Overloading so that I have something likep  precode    ...         public void handleEvent event, RenderComponent component              BaseEvents.Transform e  BaseEvents.Transform event             component.setRotatione.getRotation             component.setTxe.getTx             component.setTye.getTy                   public void handleEvent event, OtherComponent component              BaseEvents.Transform e  BaseEvents.Transform event             component.setRotatione.getRotation             component.setTxe.getTx             component.setTye.getTy              ... codepre  pThis wont work because I only have access to the handleEvent event, Component component method of the abstract class overloading doesnt seem to care about the subclass.  One idea was to create an interface like Transformable and have RenderComponent and OtherComponent implement it.  This works when the data contained in the event is applicable to both Components, but it would be very easy for that not to be the case with some Events.  p  pFor example, say I have an event for closing a window called WindowClosed.  I need to play a sound, draw a closing animation, and update the number of open windows.  Thats one event three different ComponentsProcessors need to process.  In this example, the only interface that would work would be one that covered all methods needed by each Component, which in my opinion leads to messy, messy spaghetti code.p  pIs there perhaps a clever way to solve this using Genericsp

Positive 11215 pIm trying to figure out the best way for my client apps angular to have a callback with data triggered from a server event. My current scheme is thisp  ul liclient app uploads a document not a very frequent operationli liregular rest server receives it, and dispatches it to a worker over an amqp queue, where many version are generated and shuffled around S3 could take a whileli liwhen workers are done, a message is sent, ultimately meant to trigger a callback in the client side appli ul  pIssues  we will have many cooperating apps on different machines  we have to support IE9p  pThe simplest solution seems to be that the workers put the result into redis, and the client app polls another serverapp whos only job is to hand back results from redis json params and a token to a callback to fire. If this answer callback server does nothing else, it can be plenty fast and tweaked for polling. In our case, the only server push events will be emresponsesem to something the client occasionally initiates. So a client only really needs to poll if they have a uploaded a file and b not gotten their response yet. We dont need all clients polling all the time for random server events like you would for chat, say. I wonder if this means that vanilla shortpolling would be fine, or are there advantages to using websockets or long polling that Im not aware of Any suggestions or pointers to resources welcome.p

Negative 11215 pThis is a problem I have been trying to track down for a couple months now. I have a java app running in that processes xml feeds and stores the result in a database. This has been giving intermittent resource problems that are very difficult to track down.p  pstrongBackgroundstrong On the production box where the problem is most noticeable, i do not have particularly good access to the box, and have been unable to get Jprofile running. That box is a 64bit quadcore, 8gb machine running centos 5.2, tomcat6, and java 1.6.0.11. It starts with these javaoptsp  precodeJAVAOPTSserver Xmx5g Xms4g Xss256k XXMaxPermSize256m XXPrintGCDetails  XXPrintGCTimeStamps XXUseConcMarkSweepGC XXPrintTenuringDistribution XXUseParNewGC codepre  pThe technology stack is the following  p  ul liCentos 64bit 5.2   liJava 6u11 liTomcat 6   liSpringWebMVC 2.5   liHibernate 3   liQuartz 1.6.1   liDBCP 1.2.1   liMysql 5.0.45   liEhcache 1.5.0 liand of course a host of other dependencies, notably the jakartacommons libraries   ul  pThe closest I can get to reproducing the problem is a 32bit machine with lower memory requirements. That I do have control over. I have probed it to death with JProfiler and fixed many performance problems synchronization issues, precompilingcaching xpath queries, reducing the threadpool, and removing unnecessary hibernate prefetching, and overzealous cachewarming during processing.p  pIn each case, the profiler showed these as taking up huge amounts of resources for one reason or another, and that these were no longer primary resource hogs once the changes went in.p  pstrongThe Problemstrong The JVM seems to completely ignore the memory usage settings, fills all memory and becomes unresponsive. This is an issue for the customer facing end, who expects a regular poll 5 minute basis and 1minute retry, as well for our operations teams, who are constantly notified that a box has become unresponsive and have to restart it. There is nothing else significant running on this box.p  pThe problem emappearsem to be garbage collection. We are using the ConcurrentMarkSweep as noted above collector because the original STW collector was causing JDBC timeouts and became increasingly slow. The logs show that as the memory usage increases, that is begins to throw cms failures, and kicks back to the original stoptheworld collector, which then seems to not properly collect.p  pHowever, running with jprofiler, the Run GC button seems to clean up the memory nicely rather than showing an increasing footprint, but since I can not connect jprofiler directly to the production box, and resolving proven hotspots doesnt seem to be working I am left with the voodoo of tuning Garbage Collection blind.p  pstrongWhat I have triedstrong  p  ul  liProfiling and fixing hotspots.    liUsing STW, Parallel and CMS garbage collectors.    liRunning with minmax heap sizes at 12,24,45,66 increments.    liRunning with permgen space in 256M increments up to 1Gb.    liMany combinations of the above.    liI have also consulted the JVM [tuning reference]httpjava.sun.comjavasetechnologieshotspotgcgctuning6.html , but cant really find anything explaining this behavior or any examples of which tuning parameters to use in a situation like this.    liI have also unsuccessfully tried jprofiler in offline mode, connecting with jconsole, visualvm, but I cant seem to find anything that will interperet my gc log data.   ul  pUnfortunately, the problem also pops up sporadically, it seems to be unpredictable, it can run for days or even a week without having any problems, or it can fail 40 times in a day, and the only thing I can seem to catch consistently is that garbage collection is acting up.p  pCan anyone give any advice as tobr a Why a JVM is using 8 physical gigs and 2 gb of swap space when it is configured to max out at less than 6.br b A reference to GC tuning that actually explains or gives reasonable examples of when and what kind of setting to use the advanced collections with.br c A reference to the most common java memory leaks i understand unclaimed references, but I mean at the libraryframework level, or something more inherenet in data structures, like hashmaps.  p  pThanks for any and all insight you can provide.p  pstrongEDITstrongbr Emil Hbr 1 Yes, my development cluster is a mirror of production data, down to the media server. The primary difference is the 3264bit and the amount of RAM available, which I cant replicate very easily, but the code and queries and settings are identical.  p  p2 There is some legacy code that relies on JaxB, but in reordering the jobs to try to avoid scheduling conflicts, I have that execution generally eliminated since it runs once a day. The primary parser uses XPath queries which call down to the java.xml.xpath package. This was the source of a few hotspots, for one the queries were not being precompiled, and two the references to them were in hardcoded strings. I created a threadsafe cache hashmap and factored the references to the xpath queries to be final static Strings, which lowered resource consumption significantly. The querying still is a large part of the processing, but it should be because that is the main responsibility of the application.  p  p3 An additional note, the other primary consumer is image operations from JAI reprocessing images from a feed. I am unfamiliar with javas graphic libraries, but from what I have found they are not particularly leaky.  p  pthanks for the answers so far, folks  p  pstrongUPDATEstrongbr I was able to connect to the production instance with VisualVM, but it had disabled the GC visualization  runGC option though i could view it locally. The interesting thing The heap allocation of the VM is obeying the JAVAOPTS, and the actual allocated heap is sitting comfortably at 11.5 gigs, and doesnt seem to be leaking, but the box level monitoring still shows a leak pattern, but it is not reflected in the VM monitoring. There is nothing else running on this box, so I am stumped.p

Negative 11215 pThis is somewhat of a broad question, but it is one that I continue to come across when programming in Ruby.  I am from a largely C and Java background, where when I use a library function or method, I look at the documentation and see what it returns on error usually in C or which exceptions it can throw in Java.p  pIn Ruby, the situation seems completely different.  Just now I need to parse some JSON I receive from a serverp  precodedata  JSON.parseresponse codepre  pNaturally, the first thing I think after writing this code is, what if the input is bad  Is codeparsecode going to return nil on error, or raise some exception, and if so, which onesp  pI check the documentation a hrefhttpflori.github.comjsondocJSON.htmlM000022httpflori.github.comjsondocJSON.htmlM000022a and see, simplyp  pParse the JSON string source into a Ruby data structure and return it. p  pThis is just an example of a pattern I have run into repeatedly in Ruby.  Originally, I figured it was some shortcoming of the documentation of whatever library I was working with, but now I am starting to feel this is standard practice and I am in a somewhat different mindset than Ruby programmers.  Is there some convention I am unaware ofp  pHow do developers deal with thisp  pAnd yes I did look at the code of the library method, and can get some idea of what exceptions are raised but I cannot be 100 sure and if it is not documented I feel uncomfortable relying on it.p  pstrongEDITstrong After looking at the first two answers, let me continue the JSON parsing example from above.p  pI suspect I should not dop  precodebegin   data  JSON.parseresponse   raise parse error if data.nil rescue Exception gt e    blahblah end codepre  pbecause I can look at the codetests and see it seems to raise a codeParserErrorcode on error returning nil seems to not be standard practice in Ruby.  Would I be correct in saying the recommended practice is to dop  precodebegin   data  JSON.parseresponse rescue JSONParserError gt e    blahblah end codepre  p...based upon what I learned about codeParserErrorcode by looking through the code and testsp  pI also edited the example to clarify it is a response from a server that I am parsing.p

Negative 11215 pI have a sql full text catalog on a cms database SQL 2005. The database holds the CMS page content within a ntext column which is part of the full text catalog.

However as you can see the setup is slightly different to this.p  pMany Thanks, p  pAdamp

Negative 11215 pIm working on a small Windows Form application that will be run on a Netbook computer.

What I would like it to do is allow users to augment their accounts by connecting them to Facebook I do not need people to be able to login with Facebook, I am using OpenID instead. My website runs in the CodeIgniter framework.p  pWhat I will do is remove everything that Ive tried and walk you through my steps up until it stops working.p  pstrongStep 1 Set up the JavaScript SDK and XFBMLstrongp  pFirst I add a reference to the FBML spec to my codelthtmlgtcode tagp  precodelthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml xmlnsfbhttpwww.facebook.com2008fbml xmllangen langengt codepre  pThen, after my codeltbodygtcode tag, I addp  precodeltscript srchttpstatic.new.facebook.comjsapilibv0.4FeatureLoader.js.php typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt codepre  pNow here comes the first problem I had a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3104455whyismyfacebookconnectbuttontakingmetothewrongurlbut have now solveda. The problem was that the docs for the JavaScript SDK say that the codeFB.initcode method a hrefhttpdevelopers.facebook.comdocsreferencejavascriptFB.initrequires the appIda as a parameter, but this turned out to be incorrect. I needed to pass my apiKey instead. So this is the code that I ended up with, that goes before my codeltbodygtcode tagp  precodeltdiv idfbrootgtltdivgt ltscript srchttpconnect.facebook.netenUSall.jsgtltscriptgt ltscriptgt     FB.init         apiKey   ltphp echo thisgtconfiggtitemfacebookapikey gt,         status  true,         cookie  true,         xfbml   true       ltscriptgt codepre  pNow I can add XFBML entities to my pages, such as codeltfbloginbuttongtltfbloginbuttongtcode which works just as expected. I click it and it pops up a box asking if I want to allow my website to access my Facebook profile. I say yes, and then if I check my Application Settings in Facebook, I can see that my website has been added.p  pSo this step works fine.p  pstrongStep 2 Set up the PHP librarystrongp  pOkay, so now I need to add the PHP library. So a quick google search for codeigniter facebook library reveals a hrefhttpwww.haughin.comcodefacebookElliot Haughins librarya. I download the files, put them all in the right places then get to work on loading the library.p  pNow the current problem occurs. I add the following code taken from the example given with the library to my controller constructor so that it happens on every pagep  precodethisgtloadgtlibraryfacebookconnect thisgtdata[fbuser]  thisgtfacebookconnectgtuser thisgtdata[fbuserid]  thisgtfacebookconnectgtuserid codepre  pBut if I do codeprintrthisgtdata[fbuser]code I get nothing. Ever. Whether Im logged into facebook, logged out, logged in and added my site to my profile, etc. etc. etc. The user and userid are never set. I dont get any errors though.p  pAs far as Im aware, the values are supposed to be set so that I know whether the person browsing my site is logged into their facebook account. If they are, I can see if theyve allowed my application. If theyve allowed it, I can let them disconnect from my site, if not, I can let them connect. But I cant do anything if these variables arent populated.p  pIve tried poking around inside the source of the library, but I really cant get my head around it. And Im hoping that the actual solution for this wont involve hacking the library apart. Id expect a CodeIgniter specific library to work.p  pAny ideasp  pThanks a lot. p

Negative 11215 pIve been searching the web for the last two days, but by no means, I can get my WCF Duplex service working.

Normally, my WCF service would need some time 15mins to calculate a result and then return it to the client. To simulate this, Ive put the executing thread to slepp for 12 minutes in DoWork.p  pThe exception I get always mentions a possible problem with the codereceiveTimeoutcode, which should be increased to prevent the problem. However, the codereceiveTimeoutcode and any other timeout I know is set to three hours.p  pOne more thing Im using .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 and the problem also occurs when using WsDUalHttpBinding instead of netTcpBinding.p

So Id like to know if I can create this composite key object also using an hbm file and store it with its brethren.

Negative 11215 pI noticed that some websites for example apple.com or disqus.com dont send AJAX request to load, for example, live search results.

It wont send an AJAX request to get the results, instead it will add lt script srcsome.addres.apple.comresult.jsqtest   to the HTML and execute new piece of JS script to bring in the search results. improvement Are they doing this only because you cant send AJAX request to a different domain, or is there any speed improvement possiblep

Under this obviously sterile environment, i havent noticed any difference between the threewrt performance or resolution.p  pMy Question is whether one of these is better than the other two, and if so, which one. The answer might of course depend on the facts, which ive tried to limit to whats relevantp  pWe frequently display data e.g, time series on our website, usually created in response to some user action based on that user action, a call is made to a database, the data returned is crunched and sent to the plotting engine, which renders a static image which is then embedded in the pagevery standard stuff.p  pThis works fine, but i would like to add some interactive features to these charts e.g., tooltips, hyperlinked axis labels, highlighting a group of points win a plot. Some of the charts are fairly sophisticated e.g., multipanel conditioning and i have not found a javascript chart library that includes these features. I finally settled on using the same plotting library Lattice in R but rendering each chart in svg and then adding the userinteraction features in a postprocessing step, which consists essentially of javascript functions which manipulate the XML directly.p

Negative 11215 pI have an application that uses an COM file. Sometimes this file has not been registered by regsvr32 and id like to program a function that if the file cannot be loaded it tries to register it and retry.

Now im just planning to launch another program with a manifest set to run it as admin but ive seen some installations that run without asking admin permission and when the progress bar is starting they show the UAC question to the user, so id like to do something like that. Is there a Win32 API function or library to do thatp  pThanksp

In this section I put the images resolution, a download link and a bit.ly link for coming back to the image at this website  a hrefhttpschnell.dreamhosters.comwallpapers.phppage12 relnofollowhttpschnell.dreamhosters.comwallpapers.phppage12a  Originally I was having XMLHTTPRequest problems with the bit.ly URL, but I seem to have resolved those.p  pThe problem now, though, is that I need the variable html to have all the html content thats going into the fancybox before the return statement comes up.  While it may look like everything happens before the return statement, jQuery is doing the .getJSON function asynchronosly and so its not garaunteed that html will have stuff in it before dlLink ends.  I need a way to make it so that the order of things happens as its shown in the code, so that the .getJSON request and the subsequent callback function will always finish what theyre doing before going onto the return statement.p  pEdit  I figured out what to do and the code above correctly does as I wanted.  See my answer below.p

Negative 11215 pre Hi All, I am using hibernate with my J2EE app deployed on JBoss 6.0. My database is Oracle 11i and Derby. For generating primarykey running serial Id I use TableGenerator annotation  in one of my Entity PersonDTO  like    Entity   Tablename  EDISPERSON   public class PersonDTO      Id     TableGeneratornameTABLEGEN,                         tableEDISSEQUENCE, pkColumnNameSEQNAME,                        valueColumnNameSEQCOUNT,                         pkColumnValuePERSONID, allocationSize  5     GeneratedValuestrategyGenerationType.TABLE, generatorTABLEGEN     private long id      .     .     .   And I have defined the required Entity for sequence  like      Entity     Tablename  EDISSEQUENCE     public class EdmSequenceDTO          Id         private String SEQNAME         private long SEQCOUNT         .         .         .  Everything works fine as far as sequencegeneration is concerned. But during the creation of entitites when very first time I deploy my J2EE app,  I see following error in JBoss server.log file, though all my entitiestables  get created successfully eventually.  140416,817 ERROR [org.hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaUpdate] Unsuccessful create table EDISSEQUENCE  SEQNAME varchar255,  SEQCOUNT integer   140416,817 ERROR [org.hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaUpdate] TableView EDISSEQUENCE already exists in Schema EDM. 140416,818 INFO  [org.hibernate.tool.hbm2ddl.SchemaUpdate] schema update complete  I believe this is not actually an ERROR. It looks like since I have reference  of EDISSEQUENCE as part of 2 Entity beans, hibernate tries to create it twice. Firstly, when the EdmSequenceDTO is deployed and secondly, when PersonDTO refers  the EDISSEQUENCE as part of TableGenerator annotation.  In my persistence.xml file I have hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto property with  valueupdate.  I need to have this value instead of createdrop.  I wonder is there any way I can avoid the error reported by hibernate  Thanks  Regards,  kuntal pre

Negative 11215 pIn my current project, several view controllers like codevccode spawn NSOperation objects like codeoperationcode that are executed on a static NSOperationQueue. While the operation is waiting or running, it will report back to the view controller via delegation codeoperation.delegate  vccode, assigned not retained.p  pThese operations can take a while though, and in the mean time the app can dealloc the view controller by popping them of a navigation controllers stack.p  pSo far everything is intentional. The class containing the static NSOperationQueue has a way to get back at the operations, therefore the view controllers do not retain them. Theyre just allocinitautoreleased and put on the queue.p  pNow this also causes the problem. After the view controller deallocates, any calls to the NSOperations spirited delegate will cause a bad access violation. From what I understand, it is not possible to check whether an object at a pointer has been deallocated, a hrefquestions2954261as stated in this questiona.p  pOne fix I can think of is retaining the operation and setting the operation.delegate to nil on dealloc. But thatd be my least popular fix, for it would introduce a lot of extra ivarsproperties to keep track of. p  pMy question therefore is, are there other ways to work around this problem and if so, could you sketch one herep  pCheers,br EP.p  pstrongSOLUTIONstrong The approach that worked out best for me was a slight variation to Guilianos answerp  ul lipImplementing every delegate protocol in the queue manager is not feasible 20 different protocols with 50 methods, so I kept the direct delegate assignments. What I did change was the class making the assign call. This used to be the class and delegate that created the request, but now it is offloaded to the queue manager.  pli lipThe queue manager, next to assigning the delegate to the operation, also holds a secondary mutable dictionary to keep track of the delegateoperation pairs.pli lipEvery delegate instance calls a code[QueueManager invalidateDelegateself]code method on deallocation, which then looks up the request that belonged to the delegate and nils it. The dictionary operationdelegate pair is then also deleted to allow proper deallocation of the operation.pli lipLastly with KVO observing the codeisFinishedcode property of each operation, the mutable dict is kept clean, to make sure that all operation retain counts actually deallocate after theyre finished.pli ul  pThanks Guiliano for providing the hint to using KVO for cracking thisp

Negative 11215 pMany of the newer hardware platforms running Android, in particular NVIDIAs Tegra 2, support OpenMAX for media acceleration. Its effectively impossible on todays devices to decode 720p video without this support, but the number of demuxers supported on Android are quite slim. The only public API Ive been able to find has been through the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidmediaMediaPlayer.html relnofollowMediaPlayera class in the Android SDK. There are multiple places in the Android source tree with a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiOpenMAX relnofollowOpenMAXa related tidbits, however.p  pOn my device Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 Ive got access to hardware decoders through a multitude of OpenMAX libs in systemlib, and it would be great to interface my video application with these. Can anyone point me to information on implementing a decoder powered by OpenMAX Ive found the documentation from Khronos, but nothing in the way of example code or tutorials. Ive already got demuxing and even software decoding taken care of via libavcodeclibavformat, Id just like to put hooks in to enable hardware encoding. Im also assuming here it would be necessary to link directly to the ones available on the device, which makes it pretty lackluster in terms of portability, but it works.p  pAlternatively, Im interested in anything anyone knows about private APIs for accessing the video decoding available on Tegra 2 devices. Especially if theres a emvdpauem interface like what NVIDIA implements for desktop linux distributions, since theres plenty available for that  but I wasnt able to find shared libraries that indicate that support.p

Negative 11215 pThere are a lot of discussions on web on how to have hyperlinks in swing and JTable, e.g. a hrefhttpjavaswingtips.blogspot.com200902hyperlinkinjtablecell.html relnofollowHyperLink in JTable Cella.p  pThe approach above is problematic because it only knows which cell the mouse is in, not the exactly text it is on, which meansp  ol liCan not handle multiple hyperlinks in the same cellli liCan not make the mouse cursor showing intuitively.  Whenever the mouse is in the cell that has hyperlink, the mouse will become hand shape, even when the mouse points to some normal text or even emtpy area.li ol  pAnother approach is to display JEditorPane in the cell but is also problematic because JTable only uses the JComponent returned by cell renderer to draw, I dont think the object will be sent any events.  Because the default renderer will reuse the component for every cell, so it doesnt make any sense to have it handle any events.p  pSo I wonder whats the best way to achieve the above effect.p

Negative 11215 pSince I have started learning OpenGL, I thought I would as well write a small C framework for myself to avoid the nausea that the excessive use of Cish code is apparently causing. codecode Since I am intending to stick with Qt, the framework uses some Qt classes. p  pThe first thing I really needed was an easy way to use shaders and programs. Heres my idea of the shader class. p  precodeclass Shader  public     create a shader with no source code      explicit ShaderGLenum shaderType     create a shader with source code and compile it     ShaderGLenum shaderType, const QStringamp sourceCode     create a shader from source file and compile it     ShaderGLenum shaderType, QFileamp sourceFile     Shader      change the source code and recompile     void SourceQFileamp sourceFile     void Sourceconst QStringamp sourceCode      GLuint get const get the handle  private     common part for creation in different constructors     void createShaderGLenum shaderType      compile     void compile  private     GLuint handle  codepre  pIt must be pretty obvious what the different functions are doing. Each is calling the relevant OpenGL routines, checks for errors and throws exceptions in case of any failure. The constructor calls codeglCreateShadercode. Now the tricky part. The destructor needs to call codeglDeleteShaderhandlecode but in this case I have a dilemmap  pstrongOption 1strong Disable assignment and copying. This has the upside of avoiding reference counting and the downside of being forced to use sharedpointers to put these in vectors and passing around in general.p  pstrongOption 2strong Enable reference counting. This has the obvious upside of enabling copying, and therefore storing in containerswhich I will need to later pass a range of shaders to a program. The downside is the followingp  precodeShader s1GLVERTEXSHADER, QFileMyVertexShader.vp Shader s2s1 s2.SourceQFileMyOtherVertexShader.vp codepre  pAs you see, I changed the source of s1 via s2, because they share the same internal shader handle. To be honest, I dont see a big problem here. I wrote the class, so I know its copysemantics are like this and Im OK with it. The problem is I am not sure this kind of design is ever acceptable. All this could be achieved with Option1  shared pointers, with the only difference that I dont want to have a shared pointer every time I create a shader not for performance reasons  just for syntactic convenience.p  pstrongQ1strong Please comment on the options and optionally the whole idea.supstrong1strongsupbr strongQ2strong If I were to choose option 2, do I have to implement it myself or theres a ready class in boost or Qt which I could derive from or have a member of and I would get a free reference countingbr strongQ3strong Do you agree that making codeShadercode an abstract class and having three derived classes codeVertexShadercode, codeFragmentShadercode, and codeGeometryShadercode would be overkill brp  psupstrong1strongsupsub If you should refer me to an existing C OpenGL framework, thats very goodsince I havent actually found one but that should really be a side note than an answer to my questions. Also note that I have seen a QGLShader class somewhere in the docs, but it is apparently not present in my version of Qt and I have my reasons to avoid upgrading right now.subp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThanks for the answers. I eventually decided to make my shader class immutable by removing the source functions. The shader gets compiled at creation and has no nonconst memberfunctions. Thus a simple reference counting solves all my problems at once.p

Negative 11215 pThis problem turned out to be much more tricky than it first appeared as it wasnt a problem on all but a few devices.p  pWhen creating a custom Preference by making it a subclass of Preference and also use a custom layout defined in an XML file in reslayout and use that layout in onCreateView in the custom Preference it seems you completely loose the layout information the Preferences normally have. Nothing strange with that, but if you still want a title together with the new stuff, how do you specify the size of that title if you want it to be the same size as for other preferences I was sure I had found the correct answer, setting textAppearance to textAppearanceLarge either in the layout XMLfile which seems like the better way or in the Java code in the Preference class and this works fine on most devices.p  pThis is from the custom Preference layout file p  precodeltTextView   androididandroididtitle   androidlayoutalignParentLefttrue   androidlayoutalignParentToptrue   androidlayoutwidthfillparent   androidlayoutheightwrapcontent   androidtextAppearanceandroidattrtextAppearanceLarge gt ltTextViewgt codepre  pAnd this is from CustomPreference.onCreateViewp  precodeLayoutInflater mInflater  LayoutInflater getContext.getSystemServiceContext.LAYOUTINFLATERSERVICE RelativeLayout layout  RelativeLayoutmInflater.inflateR.layout.custompreference, parent, false  Setting up new stuff return layout  codepre  pThis works and I can change the size of the title to Small or Medium and I need no Java code for the title in the custom Preference class. textAppearanceLarge is 22dp which seems to be the size of the Preference titles on most devices.p  pBut on some, for instance the HTC Sensation an Desire S the Preference title is smaller. The title of the custom Preference comes out too large on these devices. So, the layouts for non custom Preferences clearly dont use textAppearanceLarge but something else.p  pMy question now is What do they use Where can I get it for use in my custom Preferece I have searched the Internet like crazy but I simply fail to find the answer. All examples I can find use textAppearanceLarge or simply 22dp, probably because nobody has ever noticed that it doesnt always work correctly.p

Every time I make changes to my stylesheets and reload, I get this errorp  precodeError compiling CSS asset  ErrnoEPERM Operation not permitted  mnthgfsbanjareytmpcacheassetsDCF780sprockets2F5f78b3457def1d02bd3fb75d4e0cfb63  homecoderboy.rvmgemsruby1.9.2p290gemsactivesupport3.1.0libactivesupportcoreextfileatomic.rb38in chown codepre  pThe strage thing though is that if I reload the page twice or thrice, the css compiles and everything works alright.p  pIts a real shame to be reloading the page twice or thrice for every single css change I make.

Negative 11215 pTill yesterday, I was a happy user of outofthebox emacs  erlangmode.

Line 3 is indented with 3 tabs. Line 5 is indented with 3 tabs  4 spaces. Line 6 is indented with 4 tabs. As a result, most dumb editors unlike emacs display lines 5 and 6 the ones starting with ibrowse and ReqId  at the same indentation level. Which looks ugly. even stackoverflow shows them that way. p  pI had a look at several prominent erlang softwares like gproc and most of them seem to use spacesonly indentation mode.p  pSo my questions arep  ol liAm I doing it wrong seems likely to me.li liIf spacesonly is the predominant indentation way, why is erlangmode not implementing it or not configured to using it by defaultli liHow can I configure erlangmode to force spacesonlyli liWhats the right way after all Things like crosseditor compatibility seem to matter, and we cant make all editors as smart as emacs.li ol

Negative 11215 pOne of my app was rejected in iTunes connect and its getting close to 4 months120 days app upload limit. p  pWould Apple delete the app name as per its guidelines of 120 days p  pEven though we have delivered a binary, we have not delivered an approved one. It would take a week to make the changes to ensure that it gets approved but we got only 2 days remaining out of 120 days grace period. p  pSo, should we upload a binary immediately and get it approvedit takes few days minimum and we have no control before expiry date or having been rejected already makes the app name expiry clock stopp  pNote You may never know what is the reason of app being rejected and the delay of 120 day period unless you are involved.  Anyways, Please kindly stick to my question and try to answer directly as to the procedures of app store as you know. p  pThe question is My app would expire in 2 days and we already have an app uploaded thats rejected. Does it mean we still can keep the app name after 2 days which would be 120th day of our app name expiry date because our app was already processed and rejected or is the 120 day time period for having the app approved for version 1.0, NOT uploading the app binary ALONEp
Negative 11215 pStill learning this stuff on WPF, themes, derivations, etc.p  pI understand basics on the ThemesGeneric.xaml, and then setting your applications  app.xaml file to include the resource dictionary pointing to the theme in question.p  pSo, thats fine from an application project perspective.

Negative 11215 pI did some study to find out why a constructor cannot be virtual. I am consolidating my understanding here.p  pI will first explain what is a virtual function and then explain why a constructor cannot be virtual based on the first explanation.p  pstrongWhat is a codevirtual functioncode strongp  blockquote   pA virtual function is a function or a method in the base class which   can be redefined or overriden in the derived class, by a function with   the same signature. In other words, virtual function allows to have a   customized implementation of the base class method in the derived   class. It needs to be declared with the codevirtualcode keyword. At the time   of virtual function invocation, the decision to choose which version   of the function definitionin the base class or derived class is made at   runtime, depending on the type of the invoking objectdynamic   binding.p      pWhen a function is declared virtual, it tells the compiler that the   type of the object which would invoke the virtual function should be   determined only during runtime. Then based on the type of the object,   the function call should be bound to the function definition and the   appropriate function should be invoked.p blockquote  pstrongWhy a codeconstructorcode cannot be virtualstrongp  blockquote   pWhen a function is declared virtual, it tells the compiler that the   type of the object which would invoke the function should be   determined only during runtime, and then invoke the appropriate   version of the function based on the type of the object.p      pIf the constructor were to be declared virtual, it would tell the   compiler that type of object which would invoke the constructor should   be determined at runtime. But for constructing an object, the exact   type of object should be known at compile time rather than at runtime.   This is the reason why a constructor cannot be virtual.p blockquote  pI would like the SO members to correct the mistakes in both the answers, if any. I think it would help me and others, if you could correct the answers by rewriting it as your answers, rather than just pointing out the mistakes.p

Negative 11215 pI am writing a media player application and Im having trouble with updating TextViews without significantly lagging ListView scrolling.  The general layout of my application is two frames, the top frame is a ListView that shows a list of songs, and the bottom frame has controls, now playing track info, and a seek bar.  I want to add a TextView to show elapsed and remaining time.  I already have the time information updating the SeekBar in a separate Runnable class and it does allow the SeekBar to be updated from that thread.  I passed in the TextViews and tried setting them and it failed as I was not on the UI thread.  I then tried using runOnUIThread, but every time the function got called once per second, the ListView scrolling lagged quite noticeably, making it very difficult to scroll.  I removed this and instead tried using the TextView.postnew Runnable... method, but got the same effect.  Finally, I moved into my main activity class, added a Runnable, and used Handler.  This too lagged the ListView too much to be usable.p  pThe ListView contains album art icons for each album and text entries for each song.  It is backed by a custom adapter that reads from Cursors to a database not a CursorAdapter, I implemented it with two fixedlength cursors to improve large database handling.p  pIs there any possible way to make this work without insufferable lag  This was tested on actual hardware Archos A43 tablet 1GHz OMAP3, Android 2.3 Cyanogenmod 7.p

Negative 11215 pI have hundreds of small on the order of kilobytes XML files whose information I need to use at runtime.  All of the data in these XML files is useful to me, not just some.p  pAt runtime, as I hit the need for information from one of these I could construct an ElementTree, parse the XML file, and iterate over it recursively  resulting in a python object that I keep around and throw away the DOM.  But if Im going to ship the XML files and parse them at runtime Im wondering if I ought to look at a forwardonly parser rather than a DOMbased parser.p  pGiven that this data is static at buildtime, perhaps I ought to even parse the XML into python objects, pickle them, ship em, and unpickle them at runtime.  I havent used pickling yet  would it allow for the user of dictionaries, etc  Or is it meant for very basic data structuresp  pHope Im being clear  I have a lot of data in XML files that Ill use at runtime.  Wondering what would be fastest at runtime to access this data.  I dont mind leaving it in memory at runtime once its been accessed once.p  pCan share an example of the data if that would be helpful whether in XML format or what Id want the python classobject look like...p  pEDIT A few people have mentioned lxml.  Ill go look into that.  Anyone have links to parsing data from xml using lxml versus unpicklingp

Negative 11215 pI am trying to write code to test a method by mocking the class in JMock, this method internally calls three different methodsone of them is a private method. I set up the expectations for all the three internal methods. Then I call method, which is under test. The test case fails saying that it expected the private method to be called and it was not called. What is happening is that the two internal methodswith default access specifier are mocked successfully but the private method is not mocked and in fact the control reaches inside the actual private method causing the problem. When I change the access specifier of the private method to default access, then everything works fine, but I dont want to do that.

Negative 11215 pMy question is is Google appengine single threaded .Now when i ask that i know that i cannot start my own threads by using threading in  java .But we can start threads using backend.p  pI am concerned about threading with request to how requests are handled.I read someonewhere that in appengine each request is queued and then served one by one.And i can configure the max time for which a request can be queued.If time to server request exceeds max time then new instance is created.p  pSo what if i want to use single instance free  quota.p  pIf i get multiple requests as r1 , r2 ,r3,r4  in this order.Then will each of the requests be served one after other in case of single instancep  pIf i create multiple instances when the load increases and new instance is created dynamically will the data that is present in main memory of instance one will it be cloned to instance toop  pWill the data in 2 instances in synch all the timep

Negative 11215 pi realize that something wired goes on with a project i try to create. Im using the RestTemplate. And im trying to connect with a server and retrieve data.

In each one of these new classes i insert at each one of themp  precodeRestTemplate restTemplate new RestTemplate codepre  pIn order to retrieve data im using the JAXB annotations onlyfor data binding and i can retrieve whatever i want. But when im trying to execute this line of code in the new classp  precode ResponseEntityltAClassgt result  restTemplate.exchangeurl,                         HttpMethod.GET, entity, AClass.class codepre  pIm taking this exception RestClientException Could not extract response no suitable HttpMessageConverter found for response type [AClass] and content type [applicationxml]p  pIf i put it back in the previous class can be executed without problem. Really i dont understand why. Probably because im using in the new class  a new RestTemplate.I try to declare  different RestTemplates and also to declare this wayAutowired but the problem remains.  Should i declare something new in the dispatcher servletMoreover can i call in many classes the object restTemplateRestTemplate restTemplatenew RestTemplate. Should i declare it in a specific class and call it from there What should i doI expect your propositions.p

Negative 11215 pfirst of all thanks for reading. I have a web application that heavily uses Google Earth Plugin to show some sensor data and other stuff. Im trying to give the user the capability to define areas and volumes drawing them in the plugin. I was able to add area features such as creation, visualization, editing and deletion. Now im working on volumes but i really do not know what is the best way to handle them. An inportant thing to note is that im only interested in volumes with parallel  upper and lower surface no pyramid, no complex figures, only a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPrism28geometry29 relnofollowprismsa The first idea that came in my mind is to create a custom object made of 2 polygon and an array of edges to connect every polygon vertex of the upper surface to the respective one in the lower surface. Something likep  precode    Create the upper surface polygon       var aPolygonUpperPlacemark  ge.createPlacemark     var aPolygonUpper  ge.createPolygon     aPolygonUpper.setAltitudeModege.ALTITUDERELATIVETOGROUND     aPolygonUpperPlacemark.setGeometryaPolygonUpper     var aOuterUpper  ge.createLinearRing     aPolygonUpper.setOuterBoundaryaOuterUpper     ge.getFeatures.appendChildaPolygonUpperPlacemark      Create the lower surface polygon     var aPolygonLowerPlacemark  ge.createPlacemark     var aPolygonLower  ge.createPolygon     aPolygonLower.setAltitudeModege.ALTITUDERELATIVETOGROUND     aPolygonLowerPlacemark.setGeometryaPolygonLower     var aOuterLower  ge.createLinearRing     aPolygonLower.setOuterBoundaryaOuterLower     ge.getFeatures.appendChildaPolygonLowerPlacemark      var myPrism           upperSurface aPolygonUpperPlacemark,         lowerSurface aPolygonLowerPlacemark,         edges new Array      codepre  pThe proble here is that the lateral surfaces will not get displayed as real surfaces but only as lines. On the other hand i could probably create another polygon for each lateral surface but this would make the management of such a 3d shape more complex than what id like it to be.br So my question is, is there any better way to handle 3d shapes or maybe a builtin geometrybr Nota that i cannot rely in 3d models so external Kmz cannot be loaded as at the end the 3d shape creation will be a users feature. p

I developed this by making the menu bar as a User Control and for role I created property for showing the tab particular for each role.p  pstrongCode of the User Control Menu Tab.ascx filestrongp  precodeltul classmenu runatserver gt                     ltligtlta hrefDefault.aspxgtHomeltagtltligt                     ltligtlta hrefServices.aspxgtServicesltagt                         ltulgt                             ltligtlta hrefQuiz.aspxgtQuiz Engineltagtltligt                             ltligtlta hrefSuggestion.aspxgtSafety Suggestions Boxltagtltligt                             ltligtlta hrefgtPMOD Saftey Management Systemltagtltligt                         ltulgt                     ltligt                     ltligtlta hrefBeSafe.aspxgtBe Safe ltagt                         ltulgt                                     ltligtlta hrefNewsletter.aspxgtNewsletterltagtltligt                             ltligtlta hrefLibrary.aspxgtPSSP Libraryltagtltligt                             ltligtlta hrefLinks.aspxgtUseful Linksltagtltligt                         ltulgt                     ltligt                      ltligtlta hrefUserProfile.aspxgtProfileltagtltligt                      ltligtlta hrefAbout.aspxgtAboutltagtltligt                     ltligtlta hrefContact.aspxgtContact Usltagtltligt                     ltligtlta hrefFaq.aspxgtFAQltagtltligt                     ltligtlta hrefHelp.aspxgtHelpltagtltligt                      ltli idmenuItem1ToHide runatservergtlta hrefAdmin.aspxgtAdminltagt                     ltligt                      ltli idmenuItem2ToHide runatservergtlta hrefContribute.aspxgtSettingsltagt                         ltulgt                                     ltligtlta hrefKPIReport.aspxgtPMOD Safety Training Detailed Matrixltagtltligt                             ltligtlta hrefUpdateKPIReport.aspxgtUpdate Safety Training Matrixltagtltligt                         ltulgt                     ltligt                      ltli idmenuItem3ToHide runatservergtlta hrefContribute.aspxgtManagementltagt                         ltulgt                             ltligtlta hrefDashboard.aspxgtDepartment Dashboardltagtltligt                             ltligtlta hrefKPIReport.aspxgtPMOD Safety Training Detailed Matrixltagtltligt                         ltulgt                     ltligt                  ltulgt codepre  pThe system is only accessible by my division employees.

I am confused how I will develop this, because it seems that my way that I used for the Admin and Contribute role does not work here. Because the visitor will be able to view most of the pages like any employee in my division with User role. p  pstrongHow to differentiate between both of themstrongp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI am developing an intranet webbased application, so I am using the Windows Authentication and I already developed the User Management subsystem instead of using ASP.NET Membership.p

I click save to add the new post.

Of course, if I set codedisplay nonecode in the CSS, then there is no flicker, but this means the site is broken for nonJavaScript users. Ive also tried setting the CSS via JavaScript i.e. codediv.cssdisplaynonecode but this didnt work. There must be a wayp

Negative 11215 pWe have many objects distributed in host code base and in code base of addins. Our host provide settings storage which can store custom objects. It leads very long time compiling serializers during start up of application when many settings are read. We implemented small library which uses Serializable, XmlIgnore, XmlAttribute and XmlElement attributes which serializes some kind of objects no inheritance, no arrays  only lists. It creates serializers during start. Custom serializers parse XML 4 times slower then BCL, but created 50 times faster i.e. csc.exe degrades start up performance of BCL serializers. Which is OK for us. But we need our library to be fully compatible in possibilities and exceptions with BCL provided XML serialization without custom stuffe.g. custom attributes.

Ive put some informative print statements in various places throughout the SP, so I can get a sense of the processing which has completed and update a status bar accordingly.p  pThe rough structure of the SP is along these linesp  precodePrint Beginning processing  Create Temp Table Insert into Temp Table from Table Valued UDF  Print Creating working Tables Create more Temp Tables Insert into Temp Tables from SPs each SP contains a print statement e.g Starting SP1. codepre  pAll the messages are received and processed successfully, but there is a delay of a few seconds before any messages are returned from the server, then the first few arrive all at once as though they were all processed but the output was held back for a while.p  pI had naively assumed I still have a lot to learn about DB mechanics that my initial print statement would be returned before any of the other processing instructions within the SP took place.p  pI assume that the server is doing something regarding fetching execution plans anor potentially recalculating plans, or is it the case that query optimiser is doing some preprocessing before any results at all are returnedp  pHopefully my question is reasonably understandable from that mess of text. Essentially, would the query optimiser make the server perform some of the selectsinserts before the procedure actually begins sequentially encountering my print statementsp  pI also tried doing some small temp table manipulation before my initial print statement, so some rows would be returned before the slow operations began but the result was much the same.p  pThanks for any responses.p

Negative 11215 pI have previously written Spring MVC web applications where there is a front controller and we have a request mapping in each of the methods and this method in turn invokes a service implementation finally returning a view to the UI.

Just in case nor is there any instance in my style sheet which would result in setting everything to 0 and hidden and etc. on any image in my project.p  pHowever, as I said, this does not happen when the path only has the one part, the folder codefirstcode. Ive tried putting all the images from one folder into the other and still the issue remains. Ive edited the CSS values on the spot in Chrome and still nothing.p  pIt seems like an absurd issue to have because nothing is changing except the code is looking for a file inside of a folder that is inside a parent folder. Moreover because the code actually works to the point of showing the file I need and its path but not the file itself.p  h2Online trial example for you guys to see and TEMP solution or, rather, workaround.h2  pI hate working around an issue. It usually complicates things andor makes them messy. First of all, in this case it is an organization issue. Its much better to have ALL images in one folder and then make subfolders for different kinds. Having many image folders floating about the root is not a good idea to me. Second, it seems absurd to have to use a workaround when there seems no logic in the error. Third, I really would like to learn what is going on and not turn this into a PHP Bermuda Triangle. So please dont take my TEMP solution as me giving up, and please continue the synergy of this wonderful place, where no doubt at some point well arrive to a solution.p  pAt any rate, the workaround youve probably already guessed is to place the codesecondcode folder in the same directory as the codefirstcode folder, which is the root. So this should solve that specific issue. But its not a genial solution if you ask me.p  pIve been asked to upload an online trial of the issue and Ive done so a hrefhttpwww.procesosaltavida.comtrial.php relnofollowHEREltlta. Youll be able to see the same code looking for the latest image in codefirstsecondcode and in codefirstcode, and youll see that one works marvelously where the other mysteriously flopsp  pstrongQUESTION Just occurred to me. Could it have something to do with the length of the path name I.e. codefirstcode is O.K. but codefirstsecondcode is too long Doesnt make much sense taking into consideration that the retrieval of info from the path is successful, and the issue is rather on the side of the HTML outcome, but I have since tried placing the codesecondcode folder in the root and gave it a 10letter name and the issue was recreated. This, however, only happened in WAMP localhost, as when I uploaded everything online, the length didnt seem to matter. However, even online, as you can see from my a hrefhttpwww.procesosaltavida.comtrial.php relnofollowLINKa the first issue remains.strongp

Negative 11215 pAccording to my research JAXWS client proxies are not thread safe. As such, the thread safeness of the proxy is left to its implementation. According to a hrefhttpcxf.apache.orgfaq.htmlFAQAreJAXWSclientproxiesthreadsafe relnofollowApache CXFa, their proxies are threadsafe. How about the proxies of Metro Are they threadsafe I believe Metro is the default JAXWS implementation bundled in JDK and other Java EE containers. Please correct me if Im wrong.p  pJust an additional info, according to my research, Metro proxies are not threadsafe. However, I did not found any official documentation to back it up. Also, I tried to test Metro by sharing a single port with 100 threads and I did not encounter any problem. Could it be because I only use 100 threads Or is it because I did not made any modification on the codeBindingProvidercode In the threads, I only use the port to call the web service methods. I did not made any modification on the codeBindingProvidercode. Is there a specific part only in the Metro port which is not threadsafep

Second, even after my thread was created, the codeThreadscode field of my process codeprocselfstatuscode file is still 1.

Negative 11215 pi got some RESTful best practice questionsp  p1 If the server receives a DELETE request, and finds a resource and deletes it. Whats good practice to respond with 200 OK seem most natural to me, but you also have codes such as 202 Accepted. Using the latter might make it more obvious to the Client that it is something that the Server handles, rather than just responding OK.p  p2 If the server receives ANOTHER DELETE request on the same resource. Whats best practice here, do you respond with 404 Resource not found, or do you just respond 200 OK or 202 OK, with the reasoning that DELETE and PUT should be idempotentp  p3 Server receives a PUT request, but the record couldnt be found in the database. What do you respond with 404 Some other code with the goal that we want to tell the client that its not a true web 404 but that its just the fact that we looked for it but the resource could not be foundp  p4 When do you respond with messages more than just status codes p  blockquote   p200 OK Message Customer was deletedp blockquote  pFeels redundant.p

The two kogrids are configured as followedp  precodeltdiv databindkoGrid  data ItemsA, selectedItems SelectedItemsA, displaySelectionCheckbox false, enableRowReordering true, enableSorting false, columnDefs [  field Name, cellTemplate tableCellTemplate, cellClass playerrow ,      field ClubName, displayName Mannschaft ,      field DisplayPosition, displayName Position, cellTemplate playerPositionNameTemplate ], footerVisible false gt ltdivgt codepre  pOn moving items from left to the right, I will push every item from SelectedItemsA into ItemsB via p  precode.eachself.SelectedItemsA, functionidx, player      self.ItemsB.pushplayer  codepre  pAnd cleaning the selection on the left side viap  precodeself.ItemsA.removeAllself.SelectedItemsA codepre  pThey items will appear correctly in the grid on the right side bounded to ItemsB, but they are automatically selected. So if I want to move a single item back, I first have to deselect all items I moved previously How can I prevent kogrid from automatically selecting newly added itemsp

Negative 11215 pSorry for repeating a frequent question. It is now a week that I am trying to set up openCV with Qt 5.0.2  or Microsoft VC express edition in my 32bit windows 7, with no success.  now for QT   It is QT 5.0.2 MinGW . It runs programs not using opencv successfully.p  pNow, the opencv lines of my .pro file is like this  p  precodeINCLUDEPATH  Copencvbuildinclude LIBS  Copencvbinbinlibopencvcore243.dll LIBS  Copencvbinbinlibopencvhighgui243.dll codepre  pThis is because code like bellow results in error not finding core.hppp  precodeLIBS  LCopencvbuildx86vc10lib libopencvcore243  libopencvhighgui243  codepre  pNow its autocomplete for opencv functions runs, and if you write  p  precodecvMat im  cvimreadDTulips.jpg codepre  pthere is no error. But if after this you write  p  precodecvimshowim,im codepre  pIt closes the program with exception code  c0000005 It even doesnt fall in catch of an exception handler.p  pThe strange thing is that VC express is doing just the same. I should mention that I have compiled opencv for MinGW myself, and the build was Ok because it works with CodeBlocks. I used prebuilt opencv with my VC 10 , but that doesnt work either. Pleaase help meThanks a lotp

They work, the addClass does not.... any bright ideasp  p UPDATE 0807 1000 p  pDisregard that... the IE8 developer tools are apparently not developed enough to show changes in class names on the fly. The function works but my CSS did not.p  precodeinput[typeradio]checked  label, .checked input[type  radio]  label  backgroundposition 30px 0  codepre  pIE8 does not read the second line or the entire statement when it doesnt understand the first line that says checked. My bad.  Also, when the radiobuttons themselves have a display none, they do not exist for IE8 and therefore cant be targetted.... p  pBack to the drawing board.p

And then the first dynamic element gets the class in html code called codeprivacydynamic2code , second gets codeprivacydynamic3code and so on.p  pNow, my first conclusion is that I need somehow to add a similar option to xeditable in which I would create a script with same  code FieldCount code so every xeditable pop up would correspond to its result input from left rather than one popup to all dynamically made inputs.p  pI tried to generate a xeditable script in the same way I generate my html structure and it did not worked. Silly try from me, I know, generating script with script, but I was desperate.p  pTruly I dont know how it could be solved, Im a bit of a jquery noob, and Im lost in it. Can it even be solved somehowp  pHere is current situation in which you have the first static field with xeditable working, and dynamic fields with same structure for xeditable but without the script for them a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netdzorzQxMs7 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netdzorzQxMs7ap  phtmlp  precodeltdiv classcontainergt         ltinput typetext classmainactivity idmainactivity namemainactivity placeholderMain activitygt     ltdiv classparentToDelegategt         lta href idprivacy classprivacy datatypeselect datapk1 datavalue1 dataoriginaltitleSelect visibilitygtpublicltagt         ltinput typetext idprivacyresult classprivacyresult value1gt          ltdivgt      ltdiv classrowgt         ltdiv idInputsWrappergt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classrowgt         ltspan idAddMoreBox classbtn btninfo pullrightgtlti classiconplusgtltigtAdd Moreltspangt     ltdivgt codepre  pp  pscriptp  precodexeditable .privacy.editable     showbuttons false,     unsavedclass null,     type select,     inputclass inputmedium privacyselect,     source [         value 1, text public,         value 2, text approved contacts only,         value 3, text matching contacts,         value 4, text invisible     ],    function         .parentToDelegate.onchange keyup blur, .privacyselect, function             .privacyresult.val.privacyselect.val         .blur       dynamic fields document.readyfunction   var MaxInputs        5 maximum input boxes allowed var InputsWrapper    InputsWrapper Input boxes wrapper ID var AddButton        AddMoreBox Add button ID  var x  InputsWrapper.length initlal text box count var FieldCount1 to keep track of text box added  AddButton.clickfunction e  on add input button click           ifx lt MaxInputs max input box allowed                   FieldCount text box added increment         add input box         InputsWrapper.append         ltdivgt         ltinput typetext classotheractivity         nameotheractivity idotheractivity         placeholderOther activity stylemargin0px 15px 10px 0pxgt         lta href classremoveclassgtlti classiconremove iconremoveaddgtltigtltagt             ltdiv classparentToDelegatedynamic FieldCount  parentdynamicgt                 lta href idprivacydynamic classprivacydynamic FieldCount  datatypeselect datapk1 datavalue1 dataoriginaltitleSelect visibilitygtpublicltagt                 ltinput typetext idprivacyresultdynamic FieldCount  nameprivacyresultdynamic FieldCount  classprivacyresultdynamic FieldCount  privacydynamic value1gt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt         x text box increment           return false   body.onclick,.removeclass, functione user click on remove text     if x gt 1               this.parentdiv.remove remove text box             x decrement textbox                   .incomecount.triggerchange             return false    codepre  pcssp  precode.container    paddingtop100px   .privacyresult, .privacydynamic     width 40px   .mainactivity, .otheractivity     width 140px   .parentToDelegate     displayinline   .iconremoveadd     marginleft 10px     margintop 8px   .parentdynamic     display inline     top 5px     left 10px     position relative  codepre  pAny help or advice is welcome, you can edit my jsfiddle freely and post it backp

Negative 11215 pI have a singlewindow tkinter application that reads data stored in a separate python class to update the values in the interface, and vice versa. I have somewhat merged the View and Controller of the traditional MVC structure. The GUI is drawn by iterating through a dict that describes the widget type, its XY location in the grid and a few other parameters.  p  pWhen the user selects an option from one of the OptionMenus or enters values into the Entry widgets, the command attributes are used to update the values stored in the Model class. When the user clicks an Apply button, the Model is converted to JSON and sent via HTTP to configure a separate piece of hardware.p  pThere are two banks of data, both of which have the same parameters, but they can be configured differently. To handle this, there is a Button which will refresh the display to show the values from the other bank. The GUI is also refreshed when the current values on the remote hardware are updated.p  pThe current way I have achieved this is to create a Frame within the main window, and put all the widgets within this. When the GUI needs refreshing, I loop through removing all of the children of the main Framep  precodefor child in self.mainFrame.winfochildren     child.gridforget     child.destroy     del child codepre  pand then I remove the Frame itselfp  precodeself.mainFrame.gridforget self.mainFrame.destroy del self.mainFrame codepre  pthis is all done within a method of the GUI class that is called when the Button is clicked. The codeself.drawGUIcode method is then called which reads the data from the model again and draws all new widgets in a new Frame.p  pThe issue I am having is that every time I click the Refresh button and run this method, the memory usage increases by around 500KB, as if the old widgets arent being deleted. I have tried codegc.collectcode at various points in the loop but with no luck. Am I dereferencing the widgets correctly How come they arent going awayp  pstrongAdditional Infostrong When I am creating the widgets they are not being assigned to a variable, so i call the function like thisp  precodeTk.Button... codepre  prather thanp  precodebutton  Tk.Button... codepre  pIm not sure if this will make any difference.

Negative 11215 pstrong[  ]strong Question is still openp  pstrongPROBLEMstrongp  pWebRTC gives us peertopeer videoaudio connections. It is perfect for p2p calls, hangouts. But what about broadcasting onetomany, for example, 1to10000 p  pLets say we have a broadcaster B and two attendees A1, A2. Of course it seems to be solvable we just connect B with A1 and then B with A2. So B sends videoaudio stream directly to A1 and another stream to A2. B sends streams twice.p  pNow lets imagine there are 10000 attendees A1, A2, ..., A10000. It means B must send 10000 streams. Each stream is 40KBs which means B needs 400MBs outgoing internet speed to maintain this broadcast. Unacceptable.p  pstrongORIGINAL QUESTION OBSOLETEstrongp  pIs it possible somehow to solve this, so B sends only one stream on some server and attendees just pull this stream from this server Yes, this means the outgoing speed on this server must be high, but I can maintain it. p  pOr maybe this means ruining WebRTC ideap  pstrong[  ] UPTODATE QUESTIONstrongp  ol liSolve CPUBandwidth  Is there serverless solution aka multicasting or something similarli liSolve CPU  Is it possible to encode stream only emonceem and send to peersli liSolve CPUBandwidth  Multicasting is definitely possible, but does it actually work in real life latency, network instabilityli ol  pstrongNOTESstrongp  pFlash is not working for my needs as per poor UX for end customers.p  pstrongSOLUTIONstrongp  p26.05.2015  There is no such a solution for scalable broadcasting for WebRTC at the moment, where you do not use mediaservers at all.

Facebook has some weird policy that necessitates the app developer to maintain the temporary 10 minute code until the 60 day code that was obtained during the first login expires. So we should create a cookie with the Access token on the users browser. I was even able to see people modifying their code in order to create the cookies.p  pstrongWhats really bothering mestrongp  ol liThe suggested solutions assumes that the cookie that they create would be present in the users browser always.

Negative 11215 pI have been working on a GWT application, which is a variation of an issue tracking system. There are some projects, which have some tickestasks or issues assigned to some users. One of the requirements is to provide the administrator with an option to give access to a certain nonuser person, to a specific task of a specific project. This can be a read or readwrite access. p  pSo, the question is, what are some best practices to achieve this, especially in a GWT application Are there some specific protocols, or frameworks etc to be used.  My understanding is to generate a uniquenonguessable url token, map it to the tickettask, issue. And also, map the token to an access typeread, readwrite. Then, load the mapped ticket, with the right access type. But, i am wondering if there is a out of the box solution to this p

Negative 11215 pAs Im sure the title is less than clear, Ill elaborate on my question.p  pI am currently in the middle of a software development project that involves image processing for letter recognition. One of the more primitive feature extraction methods involves storing a precompiled data file and checking against it. Now, for this to work, at some stage in the process the data must be compiled from a known source of images and whathaveyou and we have done that all fine, but where should the functionality of the data compilation occurp  pI have a package called codefeatureExtractioncode that contains a class called codeVectorAnalysiscode which uses the precompiled data. Currently the codeVectorAnalysiscode class contains the functionality to generate the data if requested, but I wanted to extract all that functionality out into a separate package as there are a few other extraction methods that also need precompiled data and therefore have their own data construction methods, having a data generation package seems logical.p  pThe problem with this is that the data generation functions often rely on codeprivatecode or codeprotectedcode functionality within their respective extraction classes.p  pSo ultimately my question is p  pIs it better practice to have the data generation within the extraction classes or should I open up access to the inner workings of the extraction classes so that the generation methods can access them from external packagesp  pOr is there some other completely different practice that I have overlookedp

Negative 11215 pI have a thirdparty jar that is a dependency of my project.  Because of business constraints, I do not have access to an enterprise or company repository, which would definitely be my preference for this issue.  But regardless, this thirdparty jar is not available publicly, and so it is included in the web project under codesrcmainresourcescode.  p  pThis is a Maven project, and so I list this thirdparty jar as a compile time dependency, and include in my pom a build plugin that will install the thirdparty jar to my local repository as part of the build process I tell Maven to perform this goal during the codevalidatecode phase of the build lifecycle, which to my knowledge would be before any other Maven phase.  p  pHowever, when I run a codeclean installcode and have my local repository cleared out, the build fails due to the thirdparty jar not being resolvable locally or in the Maven central repository.  As far as I know, I have set up the pom correctly and I should be seeing Maven attempt to install the thirdparty jar locally before it begins dependency resolution.p  pThe issue is that if the dependency is listed before the jar has ever been installed locally, the build will fail due to being unable to resolve that dependency.  If I remove the thirdparty jar declaration and run the build, emafterem dependency resolution occurs which is the very first thing it does after the clean, but before any other phase, it will locally install the jar and things are fine.  But to my knowledge, it should run the codevalidatecode phase before it collects and resolves dependencies, and so the jar emshouldem be locally installed before its resolved by Maven.

Negative 11215 pI am making a program that determines if a value is composite, Prime, or Unvisited. The program ignores the first two values because they are 0 and 1, and labels them as I for ignore. Instead of outputting numbers it outputs the letter representation. example 0123456 would output IIPPCPC. It need to determines all the values up to 1000. The program uses loops to go through the array and change the value to the correct letter that represents it.

Is there any way that a Haskell compiler can optimally perform an indexing operation on this algorithm without actually generating all the intermediate resultsp  pFor example, codeinits [1..]  10000code is pretty slow. Could a compiler somehow deduce what codeinitscode would produce on the 10000th element without any recursion, etc Of course, this same idea could be generalized beyond lists.p  pstrongEditstrong While codeinits [1..]  10000code is constant, I am wondering about any indexlike operation on some algorithm. For example, could codei gt inits [1..]  icode be optimized such that no [or minimal] recursion is performed to reach the result for any codeicodep
Negative 11215 pIm new to AngularJS. Im creating some unit tests with Jasmine. Im trying to understand how to test whether or not a link was clicked. For instance, I have the following writtenp  precodeitshould click the link, injectfunction compile, rootScope    var element  compilelta hrefhttpwww.google.com gtGoogle.comltagtrootScope   rootScope.digest    expecttrue.toBeTruthy  codepre  pPlease note, I do NOT want to test if the browser window gets redirected to Google. The reason why is sometimes my links will redirect the user to a url. Sometimes they will trigger some JavaScript. Either way, Im trying to test whether the link gets clicked or not. Eventually, I will be adding some behavior that ensures the default behavior of a link is skipped. With the idea of testdriven development in mind, I need to test to ensure that link clicks are currently being detected. p  pHow do I test this in AngularJS with Jasminep  pThank youp

Here is what I have donep  precode   public Executor startBatchMode OutputStream input                 Executor executor  new DefaultExecutor              CommandLine cmdLine  new CommandLine cmdPath                  cmdLine.addArgument batch               DefaultExecuteResultHandler resultHandler  new DefaultExecuteResultHandler          AutoFlushingPumpStreamHandler httpsgist.github.commartypitt4653381                AutoFlushingPumpStreamHandler streamHandler  new AutoFlushingPumpStreamHandler System.out               PumpStreamHandler streamHandler  new PumpStreamHandler System.out              streamHandler.setProcessInputStreaminput               executor.setStreamHandler streamHandler               try                  executor.execute cmdLine, resultHandler                  streamHandler.start               catch  IOException e                   e.printStackTrace                          return executor                   public static void main String[] args  throws IOException              ExecWrapper exec  new ExecWrapper usrlocalbingm              OutputStream stream  new PipedOutputStream               PrintWriter writer  new PrintWriterstream             Executor executor  exec.startBatchMode stream              forint i0ilt5i                    writer.write convert UserslatuDesktop400.jpg UserslatuDesktopi.pngn                  writer.flush                                 writer.close codepre  pFor the output, the application enters the batch mode, and then terminates. When used from terminal it will enter batch mode and then wait for a command from user until EOF character. I have tried adding commands to the writer before calling startBatchMode but made no difference. Also tried moving things around quite a lot, but the outcome is always the same. p  pAny suggestions as to how I can make this workp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pTurns out this is very straight forward using Java runtime, and works like thisp  precode   private void runExec throws IOException          Process process  Runtime.getRuntime.exec usrlocalbingm batch           OutputStream stdin  process.getOutputStream          for  int i  0 i lt 5 i               String line  convert UserslatuDesktop400.jpg UserslatuDesktop  i  .png  n             stdin.write line.getBytes              stdin.flush               codepre  pAlthough I am hoping to stay with exec as it has some nice features which ideally I wouldnt need to reimplement. p

Negative 11215 pI have a fixed height container containing both images and iframes. To make the images responsive and preventing both vertical and horizontal overflow I can just set the following CSSp  precodeimg      maxwidth 100     maxheight 100  codepre  pThis ensures that a portrait image would not overflow vertically and a landscape image would not overflow horizontally.p  pFor iframes, Im using the paddingratio a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netbenfosterdev7LdQPtechniquea, setting the padding of the wrapper element to the aspect ratio of the iframe e.g. 56.25 for a 169 videop  precode.iframewrapper      position relative     height 0     paddingtop 56.25     overflow hidden   .iframewrapper iframe      position absolute     top 0     left 0     width 100     height 100  codepre  pWhile this means that the iframe scales with the width of the viewport it does not work the same if I change the height of the viewport.

Negative 11215 pI am developing java library that calls a HTTP script on one of multiple server to process data. The core functionality works ok and now I am looking into configuration issues.p  pThe library needs a few information URL,Username,Password,... of the server and if the connection fails it needs to get another until it gets response simple High Availability. And there can be multiple different set of servers i.e. for standard vs highpriority requests. Maybe even the order of the servers can be randomized for load balancing. And in the future we may want to implement some sort of server state monitoring into this mechanism.p  pI have to add that I am new to java so my ideas may be biased to solutions from other languages. My first idea was to create class for storing single server config and then some sort of configuration manager that would be iterable it would return iterator iterating over the server configs and serializable. That way the library could get iterator and iterate over servers until it gets valid response or run out of servers. And users of our class could use whichever mechanism for storing the configuration they need.p  pI tried to implement this and I ran into some questionsp  ul lipHow should iterator access the data of the configuration manager  the server configurations themselves and any other data that may be relevant to iterating Should the configuration manager render some sort of simple list when creating the iterator Or should the iterator access configuration managers internal fields Or should the configurationManager be the iterator itselfpli lipIs there any way how to extend serialization of the class if it would need to use fields that are not serializable probably it will non happen but I want to be ready if it doespli ul  pIs this a viable approach or should I rather use any library Commons configuration or Java Properties p

However, if the mouse hovers in the data area of the GridView, the header stays frozen.  When I hover the mouse over the header then scroll up and down the header stays in place.  When I move the mouse off of the Frozen Header after the up and down scrolling the header either re appears at the top of the page or disappears altogether.  In the scenario of the header disappearing completely, hovering the mouse over the Edit link brings the header back into place.p  pScenario 2  Mouse Hovers Over Frozen Header While Scrolling  As one of the things I tried, I thought to switch the editing links to buttons to see if that would solve the issue.  Scrolling the GridView with the mouse hovered over the Edit buttons have no effect on the header at all.  The header stays in place and works as described.

Negative 11215 pIs it OK, performancewise, to return a codestringcode from an arbitrary function in C11 What is the preferred way of returning a string if directly returning it is not recommendedp  pAFAIK, strings in C are not referencecounted because the standard forbids this practice. From my probably uninformed point of view, this means that a string will be returned by copyconstructor, resulting in a possibly large codememcpycode. Is this rightp  pIt is very straightforward and clean to define a function as codestring MyClassmakeString...code instead of something like codevoid MyClassmakeStringstring amp ret, ...code. On the other hand, the latter approach might seem better from a performance perspective.p

Any idea how to fix that or how to implement it avoiding these issuesp  pSee example code below or a hrefhttpbl.ocks.organonymous022de0b5899d42f78b4b relnofollowthis bl.ock.orga  remember it works fine in Safari but doesnt work in Firefoxp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml langengt ltheadgt     ltmeta charsetutf8gt     lttitlegtVisualizationlttitlegt     ltscript typetextjavascript srchttpsrawgit.commbostockd3masterd3.min.js charsetutf8gtltscriptgt     ltstyle mediascreen typetextcssgt     .axis path,     .axis line          fill none         stroke black         shaperendering crispEdges           .axis text          fontfamily sansserif         fontsize 12px           .clicktext          fontfamily sansserif         fontsize 11px         textalign left          ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbodygt      ltscript typetextjavascriptgt           test data set          var dataset  []          for var i  0 i lt 25 i              dataset.pushxMath.random  30,yMath.random  30                    extend and plot sizes               var w  500         var h  300         var dot         var padding   60         var defcsz  5           Description text          var pclicktxt  ltbgtUsageltbgtltbrgt             ltbrgttext test text text test textltbrgt             text test text text test text text test text text test text text test text           axes limits          var x0   0.         var x1   30.         var y0   0         var y1   30           the SVG canvas for the plot             var svg  d3.selectbody.appendsvg             .attrwidth,w             .attrheight,h             .attrfloat,left           the scales          var xscale  d3.scale.linear         var yscale  d3.scale.linear         xscale.range[padding,wpadding].domain[x0,x1]         yscale.range[hpadding,padding].domain[y0,y1]            CREATE AXES AND PARAGRAPH          function addaxes               add the output paragraph                            pclicksvg.appendforeignObject                 .attrx,xscalex0                 .attry,yscaley1                 .attrwidth, w                 .attrheight,h               .appendxhtmlbody               .appendp                 .attrclass,clicktext label                 .attrstyle,backgroundcolorrgba125,125,125,0.75paddingpadding5pxfontsizexsmall                 .htmlpclicktxt                Add xaxis              var xaxis  d3.svg.axis                 .orientbottom                 .scalexscale             xaxis.tickFormatd3.formatn              svg.appendg                 .attrclass,axis                 .attrtransform,translate0,hpadding                 .callxaxis               Add yaxis                          var yaxis  d3.svg.axis                 .orientleft                 .scaleyscale             svg.appendg                 .attrclass,axis                 .attrtransform,translatepadding,0                 .callyaxis                   circles  svg.selectAll.dots.datadataset         circlesE  circles.enter.appendcircle.attrclass,dots         circlesE             .attrcx,functiondreturn xscaled.x             .attrcy,functiondreturn yscaled.y             .attrr,defcsz             .attrfill,orange             .onmouseover,mouseover             .onmouseout,mouseout           call axes after the dots have been drawn          addaxes           define callbacks          function mouseoverd              dot  d3.selectthis             dot.transition                 .duration100                 .attrr,2defcsz             pclick.attrstyle,backgroundcolortransparentpadding0pxfontsizexsmall                 .htmlfunctiondreturn ltbgty  dot.data[0].yltbgt                   function mouseout              d3.selectthis                 .transition                 .duration700                 .attrr,defcsz             pclick.attrstyle,backgroundcolortransparentpadding0pxfontsizexsmall                 .htmlltbgtnot hovering ltbgt               ltscriptgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 11215 pI was wondering if you can assign an event listener on a certain part of a mobile phone screen For example just 90 of the screen only. I have an bottle that will spin regarding of the direction of the swipe. I have a button on the bottom of the screen that when is clicked, will go back two pages. However, when I click the button, the click is not triggered, instead the eventlistener is always triggered. This is an Augmented Reality App and I use Wikitude and Phonegap for the app. Thanks.p

Negative 11215 pCan we ignore SSL verification for local network. My case isp  pI have two applications deployed in a system. These two applications cannot communicate through internet, due to some security constraints. the two applications can communicate using their private IPs. But the certificate issued by CA is valid only for the public IP accessible from internet, so when they tries to do a HTTP connection, it throws a Subject Alternative Name invalid exception.p  pI cannot use alternate certificate.p  pPlease suggest if we can configure Java  JREs of the applications to ignore SSL validation Please suggest any alternate solution, if any.p

Negative 11215 pIn an app Im working on which utilizes Kendo UI and Bootstrap, I have a number of Grids in use I have them all set to fixed column widths so that they will scroll horizontally on smaller screen sizes.  This has led to a weird issue, so far only on iPad devices, where for tables that are wide enough to scroll, the rightmost columns that are initially out of the visible frame of the table dont render the header columns render, just not the actual data columns.  When I flip the iPad around to a different perspective i.e. from portrait to landscpae or vice versa, the columns then appear and stay that way.  p  pThis only happens for a few of the tables in the app there are several that are within a Kendo PanelBar widget, those are unaffected.  Also it only seems to happen for tables that are created from an existing HTML table, not those that are made from just a div and assigned a data source object I have one table like that and it doesnt have the issue either.p  pThanks in advance for any help you can give me.p

Negative 11215 pIm trying to build a cosine locality sensitive hash so I can find candidate similar pairs of items without having to compare every possible pair.  I have it basically working, but most of the pairs in my data seem to have cosine similarity in the 0.2 to 0.2 range so Im trying to dice it quite finely and pick things with cosine similarity 0.1 and above.p  pIve been reading a hrefhttpinfolab.stanford.eduullmanmmdsch3.pdf relnofollowMining Massive Datasets chapter 3a.  This talks about increasing the accuracy of candidate pair selection by Amplifying a LocalitySensitive Family.  I think I just about understand the mathematical explanation, but Im struggling to see how I implement this practically.p  pWhat I have so far is as followsp  ol liI have say 1000 movies each with ratings from some selection of 1M users.  Each movie is represented by a sparse vector of user scores row number  user ID, value  users score li liI build N random vectors.  The vector length matches the length of the movie vectors i.e. the number of users.  The vector values are 1 or 1.  I actually encode these vectors as binary to save space, with 1 mapped to 1 and 1 mapped to 0li liI build sketch vectors for each movie by taking the dot product of the movie and each of the N random vectors or rather, if I create a matrix R by laying the N random vectors horizontally and layering them on top of each other then the sketch for movie m is Rm, then taking the sign of each element in the resulting vector, so I end with a sketch vector for each movie of 1s and 1s, which again I encode as binary. Each vector is length N bits.li liNext I look for similar sketches by doing the following ol liI split the sketch vector into b bands of r bitsli liEach band of r bits is a number. I combine that number with the band number and add the movie to a hash bucket under that number.  Each movie can be added to more than one bucket.li liI then look in each bucket.  Any movies that are in the same bucket are candidate pairs.li olli ol  pComparing this to 3.6.3 of mmds, my AND step is when I look at bands of r bits  a pair of movies pass the AND step if the r bits have the same value.  My OR step happens in the buckets movies are candidate pairs if they are both in any of the buckets.p  pThe book suggests I can amplify my results by adding more AND and OR steps, but Im at a loss for how to do this practically as the explanation of the construction process for further layers is in terms of checking pairwise equality rather than coming up with bucket numbers.p  pCan anyone help me understand how to do thisp

Negative 11215 pIm trying to simulate a 3 sided dice and the chances of getting the same number 3 times in a row.

And y will be the total number of rolls. However the result I get does not tend to 133 over many tries. Is this because I am only counting 1s turning up in a row and not 1 OR 2 OR 3 turning up 3 times in a row Or what is the mistake here. Thanksp

Negative 11215 pI have a Movieclip level 1, MC with around 10 frames. There is a different movieclip level 2, Move Jump etc animation on each frame. Inside each of the level 2 movieclips, there are about 30 movieclip symbols level 3, Head Arm etc each spamming about 100 frames with around 3050 keyframes. Each level 3 symbol has around 10 frames, on each frame I have a particular skin graphic.p  pI have all the level 2 and level 3 symbols instance named same label across timeline for the same object, and I have the right frames stop and labelled. I also understand that everytime I enter a new frame in not just level 1 but also level 2, I have to reset all the level 3 symbols to the desired frame, because my previous settings will be destroyed upon leaving frame.p  pI got it working by doing level1.gotoAndStoplevel2name  level1.level2.level3.gotoAndStopskintype and then loop over a nasty nasty number of poses X bodyparts. AND this process needs to be performed in an ENTERFRAME event since everything will be reset again. Needless to say, I really really dont want to do it this way.p  pOne of the alternatives is breaking the graphics up and have many many level 2 poses movieclips inside my level 1 MC movieclip mage hit by warrior 3rd attack, warrior hit by rogue 4th attack.... Thats what I used to do before. But for this project, a simple calculation tells me I need to make 200 animations that way, which is not feasible. I can also get rid of level 1 MC and have the poses saved into an array, but the bodyparts still need to be refreshed every frame.p  pIm hoping that theres a relatively quick fix to this that I managed to miss, as it seems like such a basic feature, Im sure many flash games will have to go through it dress up, or anything with customization  animation really. Yet somehow Ive been searching for days and cant find a cure. The authortime ability to simply swap out graphics within a symbol to replace every frame of every animation in the entire file also suggests that theres gotta be a more universal approach to these swapping. I hope you can prove me rightp  pI do have 2 things that I dont know if I should even bother trying 1 Drag the MC onto frame1 my only frame, where I currently have nothing but code. 2 Declare each bodypart individually AND declare MC, then have MCs parts link to these bodyparts. Basically, I just need a viable method to keep these bodyparts from resetting everytime the animation goes to a new frame, my flash knowledge is not enough to tell me whether if its even possible to have these global graphics bank independent of frames.p  pAnd yes I know Im probably not doing it in the most clean way possible, but I simply animate better with visuals, so while I CAN start from shapes and animate everything using strictly code I REALLY want to move away from it. The art style is pretty important in this project.p  pUPDATE For now, I went for the ugly route. Everytime the MC changes animation, I do p  pMovieClipDisplayObjectContainerMC.getChildByNameMC.move.Hand.gotoAndStopMC.skinnamep  pAnd repeat that for all 35 body parts. Turns out that flash replaces all frames of hand in the MC.move, which makes life a lot easier. The alternative is to poll for every single frame, but the direct consequence is MUCH slower fps. Instead, right now I only need to switch graphics whenever there is a change to the moves.p  pThis works, but Im aware that it slows down performance quite a bit. In fact it can slow down performance in the same magnitude as the actual vector rendering. Limiting the swapping to only move changes is really not optional but mandatory.p

Negative 11215 pI am writing a recursive function in Haskell that takes a list of tuples as input and returns one tuple. The first part of the tuple that is being returned should be the number of tuples that were in the list, and the second part of the tuple returned should be all of the elements from every tuple in the list. To clear it up here is what an example run should look likep  precodegather [ 0, [true, true] , 1, [true, false] , 2, [false, true] ]   returns 3, [true, true, true, false, false, true]  codepre  pI am fairly new to Haskell but here is my attempt of the recursive codep  precodegather  []  [] gather n as  head as  gather n take n as tupList  [a] gt [a] tupList n xs  map x gt gather n take x xs [n..] codepre  pThe compiler does not like this at all, any suggestions on what I can do to fix this Thanks for your timep

Negative 11215 pI already found an article on stackoverflow about loading urls in the background of the app but that is before the webview has been created.  Here is the link a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7418815backgroundloadingaurlinauiwebviewBackground Loading a url in a uiwebviewap  pIve also implement codewebViewshouldStartLoadWithRequestnavigationTypecode into my program but that doesnt allow anything to load after the initial webpage has loaded.p  pMy webview has already been created and it loads a login page.  The purpose of my webview is to only authenticate the user, so after the user has entered their correct credentials and hit Log in, the webview should authenticate the user and then the webview should immediately close and load a view controller all without showing a new webpage on the screen.  So, the only webpage I want the webview to show is the login page but the user should still be able to authenticate themselves.p  pRight now, my code will move to a view controller after getting an LTPA Token from the website, which means that the user has successfully logged in, but the users account webpage shows up on the screen for a second or two.  If there is a way to pause the image of the login webpage but have the users account webpage load in the background, I feel this would be the easiest solution.  Is this possible Is there a simpler answerp  pThis is how Im opening the webpage in codeviewDidLoadcodep  precodeNSURL myURL  [NSURL URLWithStringMyFakeWebpage.com] self.myRequest  [NSURLRequest requestWithURLmyURL] [self.myWebView loadRequestself.myRequest] codepre

Negative 11215 pI wanted to make a little keylogger using the console application and I stumbled across this source code on the web and I have trouble understanding it.p  precodewhiletrue      Thread.Sleep10      for int i  0 i lt 255 i              int keyState  GetAsyncKeyStatei          if keyState  32767                      Console.WriteLineKeysi                codepre  pSo from what I understand, keystate is basically a function which tells if a key is currently being pressed. Since we want to check if any of the 255 keyboard keys are being checked we need a for cycle. Correct me if I am wrong.p  pSo if the key we are currently pressing is well... pressed, it will return some Value Would like to know what value this is...maybe the keycode value Correct me because I am sure I am wrong.p  pBut the IF is the part where I have totally lost it. If my understanding is correct, then the write line will only happen if we get 32767 which is who knows what And that is what I would like to know. Why is it 32767 How come it works even if we never get 32767, LMB is 1 for example...p

Negative 11215 pI was hoping to get some feedback before I start implementing a way to write the order of my clientside HTML elements to the server by using jQuerys Sortable UI.p  pI have p  precodeltscriptgt   function       sortablelists .sortable         update function event, ui              var data  this.sortableserialize             console.logdata                    sortablelists .disableSelection    ltscriptgt codepre  pI also have the codedivcodes that Id like to sortp  precodeltdiv idsortablelistsgt     ltdiv idid1gtModel here with server ID 1ltdivgt     ltdiv idid2gtModel here with server ID 2ltdivgt     ltdiv idid3gtModel here with server ID 3ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pThe codedivcode ids basically represent the models IDs as they are in the database. My models also have an strongorderstrong propertycolumn that allows them to become sorted using BackboneJSs codecomparatorcode method. My idea is tobr 1 Send the data to Rails using an AJAX requestbr 2 Rails then iterates through the data array, finding the model with the corresponding IDbr 3 The models strongorderstrong property is then updated in accordance with the index in the array p  pI was wondering how other people would implement this What better ways are there to do this Thanksp

Negative 11215 pI am writing Coded UI tests within Visual studios 2013 to automated some different tests for my company.  As I was writing these tests,  I was testing them and ensuring that they were working correctly which they were.  After leaving one day, and coming back into work the next,  I noticed that my tests were not working as expected as they were when i left that day. I am working on a local copy of the automated tests so that rules out someone else breaking it and the code version that I am testing of our software hasnt changed.  p  pWhat I noticed was going wrong,  was that whenever I would double click on an item say a menu to open a part of a program the double click would not register.  If I record multiple times,  recording different clicks instead of just a double click, I can get the window to pop through automation eventually.  But this is only convenient when creating new tests.p  pHas anyone ever noticed this happening and have a solution p  pThanksp

Negative 11215 pI have a RESTful API written in ASP.Net that implements OAuth 2 for authentication, and its currently accessed through a web application.  Ive also got a legacy desktop client that accesses the same resources directly not through the RESTful API and without OAuth, but using the same login credentials and hitting the same database.  The requirement Im trying to meet right now is to allow a user to click a link in the desktop application in order to open the web app to a specific screen, and when they do, to have the web app authenticate automatically so that they dont have to manually log into it since theyve already logged into the desktop app.p  pIm trying to work out how I can handle this within the constraints of the framework.  Im not too familiar with OAuth 2 in general, but from what I understand I shouldnt share tokens between clients and there are no flows specifically for this kind of handoff unless Im missing something.  Worst case scenario, I could generate a temporary token outside of OAuth thats used by the web client to authenticate rather than a username and password, but Im hoping to avoid stepping outside of whats already in the framework to do what I need to do.p  pSo the question is this is there some decent way built into the OAuth 2.0 framework to handle this sort of handshake between two applications, or should I just build my own method of dealing with itp

Negative 11215 pI am rewriting a numerical simulation code that is parallelized using MPI in one direction.  So far, the arrays containing the data were saved by the master MPI process, which implied transferring the data from all MPI processes to one and allocate huge arrays to store the whole thing. It is not very efficient nor classy, and is a problem for large resolutions. p  pI am therefore trying to use MPIIO to write directly the file from the distributed arrays. One of the constraint I have is that the written file needs to respect the fortran unformatted format i.e. 4 bytes integer before and after each field indicating its size. p  pI wrote a simple test program, that works when I write only one distributed array to the file. However, when I write several arrays, the total size of the file is wrong and when comparing to the equivalent fortran unformatted file, the files are different. p  pHere is the sample code  p  precodemodule arraysdim    implicit none    INTEGER,        PARAMETER  dp    kind0.d0     integer,        parameter  imax  500     integer,        parameter  jmax  50     integer,        parameter  kmax  10  end module arraysdim module mpivars    use mpi     implicit none    integer, save           ierr, myID, numprocs    integer, save           istart, iend, imean, iloc    integer, save           subArray, fileH    integerMPIOFFSETKIND, save    offset, currPos end module mpivars  program test    use mpi     use arraysdim    use mpivars    realdp, dimension0imax,0jmax1,0kmax1  v, w    realdp, dimension,,, allocatable        vloc, wloc    integer                                        i, j, k     call MPIINITierr     call MPICOMMRANKMPICOMMWORLD, myID, ierr     call MPICOMMSIZEMPICOMMWORLD, numprocs, ierr      imean  imax1numprocs    istart  myIDimean    iend    istartimean1    ifimeannumprocsltimax1 then      ifmyID  numprocs1 iend  imax    endif    iloc  iend  istart  1    allocatevlocistartiend,0jmax1,0kmax1    allocatewlocistartiend,0jmax1,0kmax1     print, I am, myID, istart, iend, iloc    do k0,kmax1       do j0,jmax1          do i0,imax             vi,j,k  ijk             wi,j,k  ijk          enddo       enddo    enddo     ifmyID0 then         open10,formunformatted        write10 v        write10 w        close10    endif     do k0,kmax1       do j0,jmax1          do iistart,iend             vloci,j,k  ijk             wloci,j,k  ijk          enddo       enddo    enddo     call MPITypecreatesubarray 3, [imax1, jmax2, kmax2], [iloc, jmax2, kmax2], amp                                      [istart, 0, 0], amp                                     MPIORDERFORTRAN, MPIDOUBLEPRECISION, subArray,  ierr    call MPITypecommitsubArray, ierr    call MPIFileopenMPICOMMWORLD, mpi.dat,         amp                      MPIMODEWRONLY  MPIMODECREATE  MPIMODEAPPEND, amp                      MPIINFONULL, fileH, ierr          call saveMPIvloc, ilocjmax2kmax2    call saveMPIwloc, ilocjmax2kmax2     call MPIFileclosefileH, ierr           deallocatevloc,wloc    call MPIFINALIZEierr  end program test  subroutine saveMPIarray, n    use mpi    use arraysdim    use mpivars     implicit none    realdp, dimensionn  array    integer                    n     offset  imax1jmax2kmax28    ifmyID0 then      call MPIFileseekfileH, int0,MPIOFFSETKIND, MPISEEKCUR, ierr      call MPIFilewritefileH, [imax1jmax2kmax28], 1, MPIINTEGER, MPISTATUSIGNORE, ierr      call MPIFileseekfileH, offset, MPISEEKCUR, ierr      call MPIFilewritefileH, [imax1jmax2kmax28], 1, MPIINTEGER, MPISTATUSIGNORE, ierr    endif     call MPIFilesetviewfileH, int4,MPIOFFSETKIND, MPIDOUBLEPRECISION, subArray, native, MPIINFONULL, ierr    call MPIFilewriteallfileH, array, ilocjmax2kmax2, MPIDOUBLEPRECISION, MPISTATUSIGNORE, ierr   end subroutine saveMPI codepre  pwhen the lines codewrite10 wcode and codecall saveMPIwloc, ilocjmax2kmax2code are commented i.e. I only write the v array, the code is working fine  p  precodempif90.openmpi O3 o prog main.f90 mpirun.openmpi np 4 .prog cmp mpi.dat fort.10 codepre  pcmp does not generate an output, so the files are identical.

Negative 11215 pSay, I am developing a python package which has some cython .pyx files. For example, codeutilsfoo1.pyxcode and codeutilsfoo2.pyxcode. Now, both of them are highly experimental, and undeveloped yet. Ive started testing the first file with the following codep  precodeimport pyximport pyximport.install  from utils import foo1  foo1.restult codepre  pHowever, even though codefoo1code is simply HelloWorld program, it was failing. After some struggling Ive realized that pyximport also tried to compile codefoo2code which indeed had an error, but I did not care about that one, since I have not even imported it. Apparently, pyximport whenever called tries to compile all the files in the folder, even you just import one of them. Is there  a way to change such behavior I can, and in the end I will just compile things using the setup, but I hoped that even for testing I can just compile file by file, without having to put them in separate folders. Just to clarify, codefoo1code has no references to any other file.p

Negative 11215 pHow do I add the codePOSTcode array each item per each database row I have I have a from which has various of fields, however only one of them can the user change, which in this case is the quantity.p  pThe rows in this field is exact to the one used in the PHP file ordered.p  pIve used the codePOSTcode array like so codeltinput typetext name  quantity[]gtcodep  pNow, I want to show the same information as the user is shown same rows, on the PHP side.p  pHere I havep  precodeif isarrayPOST[quantity]  isobjectPOST[quantity]       foreachPOST[quantity]as keygtvalue             sqlquery  SELECT  FROM info WHERE userid   . userid .

So each row is shown twice, and the quantity in the row is incorrect for half of them. If I have two rows, it will echo out four and only two of those will have the correct quantity, the other two will have the quantity value swapped around.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comOgLEM.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOgLEM.png altProblem in questionap  pAs shown in that picture, you can see the last value 2, 2, 15, 15 the values do not represent the correct row. The correct order should be 2, 15, 2, 15 as the rows are looped twice  which of course is not intended.p
