Positive 70479 pI am trying to fix a bug with a website where the header contains two elements, a div floated left and a codeulcode floated right.p  pNormally, the two sit next to each other, but occasionally the content of the codeulcode is large and as the two connect the div stays on the line but the codeulcode drops to the next line.

For different settings other things happened, but it never appeared proper to me. p  pMy current, strongnon workingstrong approachp  h1HTMLh1  precodelthtmlgt  lt BEGIN HEAD gt ltheadgt      ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetutf8 gt     ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefstyle.css gt      lt Start WOWSlider.com HEAD section gt     ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefengine0style.css gt     ltscript typetextjavascript srcengine0jquery.jsgtltscriptgt     lt End WOWSlider.com HEAD section gt  ltheadgt lt END HEAD gt  lt BEGIN BODY gt ltbodygt      lt BEGIN WRAPPER FOR FOOTER PUSHING gt     ltdiv classwrappergt      lt BEGIN .PAGE gt     ltdiv classpagegt          lt BEGIN .LOGO gt         ltdiv classlogogt               ltimg classlogoBB srcimageslogo.pnggt             ltbrgtlttext classlogosubgtTworzymy Dla Ciebielttextgtltbrgt          ltdivgt         lt END .LOGO gt          lt BEGIN .MENU gt         ltdiv classmenugt              lthr classtoplinegt                  ltulgt                 ltligtlta hrefgtO NASltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefgtGALERIA PRODUKTWltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefgtAKTUALNOCIltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefgtZADAJ PYTANIEltagtltligt                 ltligtlta hrefgtKONTAKTltagtltligt                 ltulgt              lthr classbottomlinegt           ltdivgt         lt END .MENU gt                    lt Start WOWSlider.com BODY section gt lt add to the ltbodygt of your page gt         ltdiv idwowslidercontainer0gt         ltdiv classwsimagesgtltulgt             ltligtltimg srcdata0imagesslide1.png althttpwowslider.net titleWOOD idwows00gtltligt             ltligtltimg srcdata0images3025992posterpdesignwork.jpg altCUBES titleCUBES idwows01gtltligt         ltulgtltdivgt         ltdiv classwsbulletsgtltdivgt             lta href titleWOODgtltspangtltimg srcdata0tooltipsslide1.png altWOODgt1ltspangtltagt             lta href titleCUBESgtltspangtltimg srcdata0tooltips3025992posterpdesignwork.jpg altCUBESgt2ltspangtltagt         ltdivgtltdivgtltdiv classwsscript stylepositionabsoluteleft99gtlta hrefhttpwowslider.comgtwowslider.comltagt by WOWSlider.com v8.6ltdivgt         ltdiv classwsshadowgtltdivgt         ltdivgt           ltscript typetextjavascript srcengine0wowslider.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscript typetextjavascript srcengine0script.jsgtltscriptgt         lt End WOWSlider.com BODY section gt           ltdivgt         lt END .PAGE gt          lt FOOTER PUSHER gt         ltdiv classpushgtltdivgt      ltdivgt     lt END .WRAPPER gt      lt BEGIN FOOTER gt     ltdiv classfootergt          lt BEGIN FOOTER CONTAINER gt         ltdiv classfootercontainergt              lt BEGIN .FINDUS gt             ltdiv classfindusgt              ltdivgt             lt END .FINDUS gt              lt BEGIN .DESIGNERS gt             ltdiv classdesignersgt              ltdivgt             lt END .DESIGNERS gt              lt BEGIN .INSPIRATIONS gt             ltdiv classinspirationsgt              ltdivgt              lt END .INSPIRATIONS gt          ltdivgt         lt END FOOTER CONTAINER gt             ltdivgt     lt END FOOTER gt  ltbodygt lt END BODY gt codepre  pp  h1CSSh1  precode GENERAL PAGE SETTINGS        margin 0     padding 0   .page      margin 25px auto     width 960px    WRAPPER amp HTML SETTINGS  html, body      height 100   .wrapper      minheight 100     height auto important     height 100     margin 0 auto 168px   .footer, .push      height 168px  .push must be the same height as .footer     FOOTER SETTINGS  .footer      clear both     width 100     backgroundcolor 323232   .footercontainer      width 960px     margin 0 auto     backgroundcolor red   .footer .findus      float left     width 33,33333   .footer .designers      float left     width 33,33333     backgroundcolor red    .footer .inspirations      float left     width 33,33333     LOGO SETTINGS   img.logoBB      margin 0 28.95833333333333    .logosub      fontfamily Federant     fontsize 17.83px     color 94979b     padding 0 40.625    MENU SETTINGS  .menu      margin 0 90px    .menu ul      textalign center     liststyletype none     margin 17px auto   .menu li      display inlineblock   .menu a      color black     textdecoration none     fontfamily slabo     fontsize 18px       .menu .topline      width 780px     margin 32px 0 0     height 2px     color black     backgroundcolor black   .menu .bottomline      width 780px     margin 0 0 40px     height 3px     color black     backgroundcolor black  codepre  h2What I have tried none workedh2  ul liApplying table to a footer li liUsing left, right and center float in that order with both  values and pixel valuesli liTried fixed values of everything in footer this worked yet Im aiming to make this website responsive so that is not the way to go by any means.li ul  pIf you happen to notice any other mistakes I have made, Id be grateful for pointing them out.p

Positive 70479 pI am having a problem with CSS. I have codeltdivgtcode element with two codeltdivgtcodes inside. One of them has the style codefloatleftcode, the other one has codefloatrightcode. Their width is set to 50 and it all works great, they are aligned exactly the way they should. The problem is when I set media minwidth500px, I want them to behave normally as codeltdivgtcodes and to display one below other. This happens, but second div is not aligned to left as it should, instead it stays to right, and just goes below the first div. p  pHow do I fix thisp
Positive 70479 pI have been scouring Google for the better part of my morning trying to find an Org Chart solution for an editable organization chart but almost all of my searches bring me back to a hrefhttpcodepen.iosiironpenaLkdE relnofollowthis suggestion.ap  pNow, this would be fine however, when I try to remove a department the layout gets completely destroyed and attempting to fix it is time consuming and confusing to me. I liked this layout a lot and I was hoping that this would be the solution I needed but it is currently too hard to work around changes.p  pIve also look at D3JS but it seems a little bit overboard for what I actually need to do. I only need a few nodes as it is so if its possible, Id like an HTMLCSS only solution however, if JS is the route I need to take that would be ok too.p  pAgain, Im looking for responsive designs and, so far, nothing but the CodePen example seem to satisfy that.p  pThanks ahead of time.p  precode HTML  ltdiv classcontentgt   lth1gtResponsive Organization Chartlth1gt   ltfigure classorgchart cfgt

Negative 70479 pI have been asking a lot of questions about a project I have been working on recently. Here is the scenario I am in and any help or point in the right direction would help a lot...p  pThis is a network program built with a server and multiple clients. Each client has a GUI which must act according to commands sent from the server. Each client is wrapped within a class called codePlayercode. This codePlayercode has a GUI extends codeJFramecode and a main method, and the Server has a main method only no GUI. At first, this class was created in the main thread like thisp  precodeEventQueue.invokeLaternew Runnable      public void run              new Player.setVisibletrue        codepre  pThis was working fine, until I realized that the entire codePlayercode class was now executing in the EDT. So, when I wait for commands from the server the entire GUI locks up until that command is sent and proper actions are executed. As you can imagine, this is a horrible design and proved to be a real pain of a coding environment when every time you want to check for something you must find some crazy work around so that the GUI still remains intact.p  pObviously, I must check for the commands from the Server in a separate thread and run the GUI components in the EDT. My second implementation had two classes  one for the GUI and one for the codePlayercode. The idea was that the codePlayercode had a variable that held the GUI so that I could access the GUI from the codePlayercode class, something like thisp  precodeclass Player      public GUI gui      ...       And then start this gui inside of the EDT.     EventQueue.invokeLaternew Runnable               public void run                         this.gui  new GUI.setVisibletrue                codepre  pThis doesnt work either, because codethiscode inside of the new codeRunnablecode object refers to the codeRunnablecode object, not the codePlayercode.p  pHow can I communicate between the codePlayercode class in one thread and the corresponding GUI class in the EDT threadp

Negative 70479 pI have a DataGridView being regularly populated via databound objects, and the number of rows can potentially become large, say many thousands during a logging cycle.p  pWhen a new logging cycle begins, the grid is cleared because the underlying datasource is cleared and the process begins again.p  pThis is all fine, but because the previous run takes some time, all those previous rows have become Generation 2 objects, and only garbage collected on a full GC.p  pHowever, it takes TWO full GCs to clear them out because the first one sends them all to the finalizer queue. This means that they hang around twice as long hogging memory.p  pUsing reflector, I see that DataGridViewRow does not have a finalizer method, but it does inherit from a DataGridViewBand object, which does  and it calls GC.SuppressFinalizethis via its public Dispose method.p  pSo my question is  why do my DataGridViewRows not get collected on the first full GC and make it onto the finalizer queue awaiting another onep  pMy assumptions here are that any object without a finalizer should not get placed onto the finalizer queue, and any object that does have one but calls GC.SuppressFinalize will also not be placed on the queueo.

However, I need to know what is the best way to store a password that my application needs to communicate with another application via the web Currently, our web app needs to transmit data to a remote website.

Is there any way to store the password more securelyp  pThis is a linux os and the application is written in python and is not compiled.p  pThanksp  pFurther clarification There are no users involved in this process at all. The password stored in the file system is used by the other web app to authenticate the web app that is making the request.

Negative 70479 pI am trying to manipulate an image using a chain of CIFilters, and then examine each byte of the resulting image bitmap.  Long term, I do not need to display the resulting image bitmap  I just need to analyze it in memory.  But nearterm I am displaying it on screen, to help with debugging.  p  pI have some bitmap examination code that works as expected when examining the NSImage bitmap representation I use as my input loaded from a JPG file into an NSImage.  And it SOMETIMES works as expected when I use it on the outputBitmap produced by the code below.  More specifically, when I use an  NSAffineTransform filter to create outputBitmap, then outputBitmap contains the data I would expect.  But if I use a CILineOverlay filter to create the outputBitmap, none of the bytes in the bitmap have any data in them.  I believe both of these filters are working as expected, because when I display their results on screen via outputImageView, they look correct.  Yet when I examine the outputBitmaps, the one created from the CILineOverlay filter is empty while the one created from NSAffineTransfer contains data.  Furthermore, if I chain the two filters together, the final resulting bitmap only seems to contain data if I run the AffineTransform last.  Seems very strange, to mep  pMy understanding from reading the CI programming guide is that the CIImage should be considered an image recipe rather than an actual image, because the image isnt actually created until the image is drawn.  Given that, it would make sense that the CIimage bitmap doesnt have data  but I dont understand why it has data after I run the NSAffineTransform but doesnt have data after running the CILineOverlay transform  Basically, I am trying to determine if creating the NSCIImageRep ir in the code below from the CIImage myResult is equivalent to drawing the CIImage  in other words if that should force the bitmap to be populated  If someone knows the answer to this please let me know  it will save me a few hours of trial and error experimentingp  pFinally, if the answer is you must draw to a graphics context ... then I have another question  would I need to do something along the lines of what is described in the Quartz 2D Programming Guide Graphics Contexts, listing 27 and 28  drawing to a bitmap graphics context  That is the path down which I am about to head ... but it seems like a lot of code just to force the bitmap data to be dumped into an array where I can get at it.  So if there is an easier or better way please let me know.  I just want to take the data that should be in myResult and put it into a bitmap array where I can access it at the byte level. And since I already have code that works with an NSBitmapImageRep, unless doing it that way is a bad idea for some reason that is not readily apparent to me, then I would prefer to convert myResult into an NSBitmapImageRep.p  precodeCIImage  myResult  [transform valueForKeyoutputImage]  NSImage outputImage NSCIImageRep ir  [NSCIImageRep alloc] ir  [NSCIImageRep imageRepWithCIImagemyResult] outputImage  [[[NSImage alloc] initWithSize                               NSMakeSizeinputImage.size.width, inputImage.size.height]                              autorelease]                     [outputImage addRepresentationir] [outputImageView setImage outputImage] NSBitmapImageRep outputBitmap  [[NSBitmapImageRep alloc] initWithCIImage myResult] codepre  pThanks, Adamp  pEdit 1  for Peter H. comment Sample code accessing bitmap data...p  precodefor row  0 row lt heightInPixels row   for column  0 column lt widthInPixels column      if row  1340   just check this one row, that I know what to expect         NSLogRow 1340 column d pixel redByte of pixel is d,column,thisPixelgtredByte       codepre  pResults from above all columns contain the same zeronull value, which is what I called empty...p  precode20100613 103907.765 ImageTransform[5582a0f] Row 1340 column 1664 pixel redByte of pixel is 0 20100613 103907.765 ImageTransform[5582a0f] Row 1340 column 1665 pixel redByte of pixel is 0 20100613 103907.766 ImageTransform[5582a0f] Row 1340 column 1666 pixel redByte of pixel is 0 codepre  pIf I change the d to h nothing prints at all blank rather than 0.

It even works just fine if I chain together the transforms so that the output from 1 goes into 2.  So, to me, this seems to indicates that the filters are working.  p  pHowever ... the code that I really need to use is the bitmap analysis code that is examining the bitmap that is in or should be in Results2.

Negative 70479 pI have been trying to create a web page that will redirect the user after he has watched a video or if he aborted the playback. Ive got this working on the iphone but cant really figure out how it works on the android.p  pOn the Iphone i have found two ways of doing this. using the  tag to embed the quicktime plugin and then adding a event listener with javascript to listen to the qtended event. This does obviously not work on android because there is no quicktime plugin. p  pThe second thing i tried was using the html5 tag and listening to the ended event, again this worked on the iphone but to my surprise not on android. In this case i got the video playing on the android phone but no redirect occurred after the video had reached the end. So my guess is that the android browser does not fully support the videotag and that it does not fire the event.p  pSo at this time i dont really know how to proceed. Im guessing i could do something similar to the quicktime embed solution but using a plugin available on android. But i cant find any information on what plugins is available on the android and if they support some kind of endedevent. p

Negative 70479 pAll of those disadvantages of stored procedures database portability etc. I am now facing. We are going to migrate our VB.NetASPSQL Server application to something like MonoPostgresql and fully internationalize.p  pOne of the many issues we face is that we have 800900 stored procedures. What we are thinking of doing is moving the logic in these SPs in to the application code. I have searched around for how people have done this or how it can be done however I have found very little. Most of the info on stored procedures is about what should be in them etc. So I have come to the conclusion that the best way to approach this is to leave the SQL retrieveupdate type queries as stored procedures and move the ones with business logic in to the application.p  pSo my question is what is the best approach to take in doing something like this there may not be a best approach but some suggestions of where to start would be goodp  pThanks Liamp

This application heavily uses PFC.br p  pNow I had no prior powerbuilder training when I joined this company, but I learned a few things while working in this application, e.g., datawindow, powerscript etc. But I still cant get my head around all the PFC things that are being used.p  pSo where can I get a quick start tutorial on PFC How should I proceed with thisp  pAll types of suggestions are welcome.p

Negative 70479 pIm using the AutoComplete UI widget for a form to allow users to type in a customer name.  The idea is that they can either select an existing customer and populate other fields in the form, or they can freetype a new customer to be created.  When a user selects an existing customer, I use the codeselectcode event to populate a hidden input to store the ID associated with that customer.p  pThe problem Im having is if a user first selects a customer from the list but then goes in and edits the text, in effect creating a new customer, I need to be able to clear out that hidden input ID value.p  pI referred to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2820338jqueryuiautocompleteeventchangethis SO questiona and created the following codep  precodefunction              customerName.autocomplete                 source CustomersCustomerListJSON,                 minLength 2,                 select functionevent, ui                      customerId.valui.item  ui.item.Id                   ,                 change functionevent, ui                      try                          trace.appenddocument.createTextNodeevent.originalEvent.type  ,                          if event.originalEvent.type  menuselected                             customerId.val                      catch err                          customerId.val                                                             codepre  pThe problem is that the change event is fired on codeblurcode, so if a user selects a customer, the hidden input value is populated, but as soon as they move focus off the input box its cleared right away.  However, if I exclude the codeblurcode event from the codeevent.originalEvent.typecode test, then the hidden fields value never gets reset in the original scenario where a user edits a previouslyselected value.p  pHas anyone had to tackle this before, and if so can you offer some guidance on how I can manage that hidden inputs value so its populated emonlyem when an item is selected from the list and cleared with any other valuep

Negative 70479 pOk, so Ive got this Visual Studio 2008 Project I was working with about a year ago perhaps.  And this project had a datagrid that was linked to an external database running on a server off the internet. Now, this databinding was all done using Visual Studio 2008s built in features. But how can I now change the binding to a different server, without destroying the project Ive noticed that a lot of the code that Visual Studio creates makes a mess. So manually trying to change the datasource has allways fcked up the whole project for me.p  pIm not all that good with this stuff, thats why I used the built in features of Visual Studio. But I noticed that several things appear, like a binding source, and a dataset.  Is it possible to do this Perhaps even better, making these settings be controlled after the program has been compiled. The way it is now, its all hard coded after compiling, and that kinda sucks. I remember trying to do this about a year ago, trying to bind these settings to variables stored in settings. But I never got that to work. Just throwing around ideas here p  pAny help, pointers or whatever is highly appreciated p

Negative 70479 pI have markup that looks roughly like thisp  precodeltdiv classrootgt     ltdiv classwrappergt         ltdiv classcolumngt             ...         ltdivgt         ...     ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pThe root div has codeoverflow autocode, and widthheight that may change.  The columns have fixed widths and are floated left.  The wrapper has a fixed width corresponding to the sum of the column widths.  The end result is a set of horizontallylaidout columns within a view that shows scroll bars when the column height or total column width exceeds its bounds.p  pI have applied a jQuery UI sortable to the wrapper div, so the columns inside can be sorted.  This works great, except for one problem sortable gives the element being sorted codeposition absolutecode, which apparently removes it from the normal layout.  So if the column is very tall, the entire page gets a scroll bar until the element is dropped back into position.p  pIs there any way for the sortable helper to remain contained within the scrolling div even while sortingp

Negative 70479 pIm writing a DLL in C for use with VB6.

However, I need to maintain an instance of a class internally  so I intend to keep the object as a global variable and call the constructor from a global function, and after that, use another global function to call a method on the object.p  pI had the idea that maybe one function would be enough It would check if an instance is present in a global variable, and if not, create it, and then call the method on the object or, if it is present, immediately call the method. p  pNow, how can I find out whether an instance is already created I cant assign a global variable any value in the declaration, right And they also dont have a guaranteed default value in C, as far as I understand.p  pTherefore my question Is this possible anyway and howp  pOr can I use the codeBOOL APIENTRY DllMain HMODULE hModule,                        DWORD  ulreasonforcall,                        LPVOID lpReserved                      code function to initialize variables If so, can someone fill me in on what the codeulreasonforcallcode cases exactly are and which of these is automatically called when VB6 loads the DLL as in my linked examplep

Negative 70479 pI have a security issue with one of our distributors.  I need to prevent them from accessing certain data in our database.   Because they administer the database I cant use password controls on the database itself to protect the data.

That way the distributor can poke around in the database all they want but the sensitive data will be unintelligible to them.   I see how this might be done in MYSQL.   There is are ENCODE and DECODE functions that allow me to pass a key in as a parameter.   I can embed these keys in a piece of software, lock the software down, and this will allow me to insert and retrieve information.   But what about MS SQL.

For the job running against the nonfailing oracle server I had codeltcronTriggerExpressiongt05     ltcronTriggerExpressiongtcode which ran the batch job every five seconds. I figured that once a minute was sufficent for the other oracle server, and set the quartz scheduler up with  1    . This turns out to be wrong, and instead of running every minute, this ran every second p  pEach job took approximately 1.52 seconds, and thus two or more jobs were running concurrently, thus causing simultaneous inserts on the server. So instead of inserting 529 elements, I was getting anywhere from 1000 to 2000 inserts. Changing the crontrigger expression to the same as the other one, running every five seconds, fixed the problem.p  pTo find out what was wrong I had to set true in hibernate.cfg.xml and disable the primary key constraint on the table.p  precode To catch exceptions  to find the offending rows run the following query  SELECT  FROM uptimestatistics, EXCEPTIONS WHERE MYTABLE.rowid  EXCEPTIONS.rowid create table exceptionsrowid rowid,                         owner varchar230,                         tablename varchar230,                         constraint varchar230   This table was set up CREATE TABLE MYTABLE        LOGDATE DATE NOT NULL,     SERVICEID           VARCHAR2255 CHAR NOT NULL,     PROPA   NUMBER10,0,     PROPB NUMBER10,0,     CONSTRAINT PKCONSTRAINT PRIMARY KEY LOGDATE, SERVICEID      Removed the constraint to see what was inserted twice or more alter table mytable   disable constraint PKCONSTRAINT   Enable this later on to find rows that offend the constraints alter table mytable   enable constraint PKCONSTRAINT     exceptions into exceptions codepre

Negative 70479 pI am designing an API that has to be binarycompatible between at least mingw and msvc. So far I have restricted myself to using function which take and return primitive data types or pointers to PODstructs with uniform members i.e. the members are all of the same type, which should reduce the risk of incompatible padding.p  pIt would be convenient at some points to return structs by value though, so that the callee does not need to keep a temporary copy. So the question is Is it safe to pass structs by value tofrom stdcall functions, when the callee was compiled by a different compiler than the caller Does this still hold for less recent versions of msvc and mingw I would be more confident that it is, but I found a hrefhttpold.nabble.comProblemreturningCstructfromMinGWtoMSVCtd18444899.html relnofollowthis topica discussing a problem in this exact situation with cdecl calling convention, which was apparently only solved in mingw 4.6.p

The ws guys have a repository of Jackson compliant classes for those schemas, however I dont want to use Jackson  Im using Spring Android, so Id prefer to go with the preferred a hrefhttpsimple.sourceforge.netsimplexmla. There must be something that does the trick like JAXBs xjc tool.p  pIf there is no such tool  can you think of any traps in implementing a script that generates a .java file for a hrefhttpsimple.sourceforge.netsimplexmla from the schema Maybe any hints for tools worth extending that would just require defining what annotations to generate and whenp  pIn advance  thanks a lot for your answersp

Negative 70479 pWP7 suffers pretty severe performance penalties when too many sounds are played. I have an AudioManager that keeps track of SoundEffectInstances and prevents too many from playing at once.p  pHowever, some things dont require an instance and simply call Play on a SoundEffect itself. For example, a bullet plays an impact sound when it hits something but doesnt actually need an instance.p  pMy current system only manages Instances. What Id like to do is see if I have an existing instance of that SoundEffect on hand thats not used and simply play it. This would require finding the SoundEffect type of a SoundEffectInstance, checking if its played and then playing it if not. Doing this will enable me to keep track of total playing sounds more accurately.p  pHopefully that makes sense and someone can point me in the right direction.p

Negative 70479 pHow could I make a Todays featured article system using codePHPcode and codeMySQLcodep  pEach day, the first time a user visits the site, I need to randomly select one article from the database, and that will be used for the whole day, for every user that comes to the site. This would happen without any intervention of the administrator, so the script would be triggered by the users visiting.p  pAs I understand it, the first time a user visits the page on a new day, the script would randomly or on some other basis select an article, then flag it in the database, at the same time unflagging the article from the previous day. But what if two users are visiting the same page at the same time This would probably mean there will be two articles flagged at the same timep  pAnd how do you cope with time zonesp

Negative 70479 pIve been struggling to understand why the jQuery animation on a site Ive just started building was running so sluggish..  Turns out it is something to do with backgroundsizecover that I have applied to a large background image on the body tag.p  pThe sluggish performance is only happening to me in Firefox, its fine in safari and chrome and I tried disabling all addons so dont think its anything like that affecting things.p  pWhen I switch off backgroundsize in firebug my jQuery slideDown effects run smoothly. Put it back on and they run much more jerky.  Same thing happens when I animate using CSS3 transitions instead.p  pAny ideas why the backgroundsize property is affecting the animationsp  pThe page in question is a hrefhttpflc.timidmedia.co.uk relnofollowhttpflc.timidmedia.co.uka    If you hover any of the boxes on the right hand column you should see then animation.p

Negative 70479 pTill yesterday, I was a happy user of outofthebox emacs  erlangmode. Then my colleague started contributing to the project using some windows editor, and it seems he is not very happy with the mixed indent mode used by default by erlangmode. Here is an example. This a part of a function, written using autoindent on erlangmodep  precodehandleinfogetgsslatestversions, State gt     GetReqIds  funBranch gt             GetInfoUri  Statestate.gssuri  Branch  apigetinfo,             case ibrowsesendreqGetInfoUri, [], get, [], [streamto, self] of                 ibrowsereqid, ReqId gt                 ReqId, Branch                 error, Reason gt codepre  pIf you take a closer look, youll see that line 2 starting with GetReqIds is indented with 4 spaces. Line 3 is indented with 3 tabs. Line 5 is indented with 3 tabs  4 spaces. Line 6 is indented with 4 tabs. As a result, most dumb editors unlike emacs display lines 5 and 6 the ones starting with ibrowse and ReqId  at the same indentation level. Which looks ugly. even stackoverflow shows them that way. p  pI had a look at several prominent erlang softwares like gproc and most of them seem to use spacesonly indentation mode.p  pSo my questions arep  ol liAm I doing it wrong seems likely to me.li liIf spacesonly is the predominant indentation way, why is erlangmode not implementing it or not configured to using it by defaultli liHow can I configure erlangmode to force spacesonlyli liWhats the right way after all Things like crosseditor compatibility seem to matter, and we cant make all editors as smart as emacs.li ol

Negative 70479 pToday Ive been bouncing all around the internet, and after reading up on a lot of solutions Ive decided that writing a Chromium wrapper would be an interesting learning experience not to mention it would be worthwhile for several projects that I am currently working on.p  pI know that there are already some wrappers out there a hrefhttpawesomium.comawesomiuma, a hrefhttpberkelium.orgberkeliuma, not to mention some basic tutorials a hrefhttpaautar.digitalradiation.comblogp1327like this onea, but Im looking at writing my own wrapper.p  pMy main interest in doing this is so that I am able to create and access the DOM structure generated by WebKit for use in C, both before and after any javascript which the html depends on has been ran.  I know I could look at using the a hrefhttphtmlagilitypack.codeplex.comHTMLAgilityPacka and a hrefhttpwww.majestic12.co.ukprojectshtmlparser.phpMajestic12a for HTML parsing, but Im looking to build something on top of a tried and tested engine that is fast, efficient, and will be actively developed for the foreseeable future.  WebKit is an actively developed layout engine embedded in some of the most popular browsers, and V8 is an impressive javascript engine, hence the decided use of Chromium.p  pSeeing as how I do not care about actually rendering any content and instead I am looking to access the structure of the web page, I feel that embedding WebKit in its entirety could potentially be overkill.  Even in the instances where Id like javascript to alter the DOM, I still have no use for rendering the results.p  pstrongIn summarystrongp  pAll I truly want from Chromium is the ability to create the DOM of a web page, and optionally the ability to run said pages scripts using Chromiums impressive V8 engine to further manipulate the DOM.  I know that this will be quite an undertaking, but Im interested to see what you have to say.  strongIn short, has someone worked with WebKit and V8 possibly via Chromium, who could assess the feasibility of this and lend me their expertise via recommendations for how to approach thisstrong  I know that I could eventually determine an appropriate way of approaching this, but Im looking to expedite the process a bit.  Links or perhaps a relatively short and sweet highlevel This is how Id do it are what Im looking for aka I dont need anything too terribly fancy.p  pIm hoping that what Im asking isnt too scatterbrained.  If you find it too general and want to close this topic, instead of doing so please leave a comment and Ill try to narrow the focus.  As I just stated my mind is bouncing around today since Im coming down with a cold.p

I then created a new folder in the ManifestTesting folder called pages and moved page1 and page2 into it. I updated the links in the index to reference the new location and if I browse the website without the manifest reference, it all works fine just as before. I then rereference the manifest file in the index and update the manifest to be likep  precodeCACHE MANIFEST  CACHE index.htm pagespage1.htm pagespage2.htm codepre  pI then clear history, refresh, firefox asks to allow the website to store offline data, enable offline mode and then attempt to navigate to page1  it doesnt work FireFox tells me its in offline mode and cant browse the webp  pWhat am I doing wrongp

Negative 70479 pI have a number of files on my website that are private and pushed through php. I keep track of the downloads using a mysql database. Currently I just use a column for each file and insert a new row for every day, which is fine because I dont have many files.p  pHowever, I am going to be starting to add and remove files fairly often, and the number of files will be getting very large. As I see it I have two optionsp  pThe first is to add and remove columns for each file as they are added and removed. This would quickly lead to the table having very many columns. I am selftaught so Im not sure, but I think thats probably a very bad thing. Adding and removing columns once there are a lot of rows sounds like a very expensive operation.p  pI could also create a new database with a generic fileID feild, and then can add a new row every day for each file, but this would lead to a lot of rows. Also, it would be a lot of row insert operations to create tracking for the next day.p  pWhich would be better Or is there a third solution that Im missing Should I be using something other than mysql I want something that can be queried so I can display the stats as graphs on the site.p  pThank you very much for your help, and for taking the time to read.p

Negative 70479 pI work with a system where we do a lot of batch processing.  We have caches that are preloaded to help with data lookup performance.  There are scenarios however where I cannot cache the entire dataset into memory.  Up to this point, Ive been reverting to running a query to lookup the data which kills performance.  In an attempt to resolve, Ive added a hybrid cache where I use a HashMap up to a threshold and then I spill over to a Lucene index local file system.  This is a definite improvement over running the query anywhere from 6 to 10 times faster than the database query.  However, I was hoping for a little better and was wondering if there are better alternatives for this kind of thing.  Im using a single String as my key and am caching Java objects.  Id like to stick with a Java library to not complicate my deployment.  Id like to avoid a separate server process.  I was wondering if anyone else was using Lucene for this purpose.  Are there better alternatives for thisp

Negative 70479 pI am trying to incorporate a data cache for one of my GWT widgets.br I have a datasource interfaceclass which retrieves some data from my backend via codeRequestBuildercode and JSON.  Because I display the widget multiple times I only want to retrieve the data once.   p  pSo I tried to come with an app cache. The naive approach is to use a codeHashMapcode in a singleton object to store the data. However I also want to make use of HTML5s localStoragesessionStorage if supported.br HTML5 localStorage only supports String values. So I have to convert my object into JSON and store as a string. However somehow I cant come up with a nice clean way of doing this. here is what I have so far.p  pI define a interface with two functions codefetchStatsListcode fetches the list of stats that can be displayed in the widget and codefetchStatsDatacode fetches the actual data. p  precodepublic interface DataSource      public void fetchStatsDataStat stat,FetchStatsDataCallback callback     public void fetchStatsListFetchStatsListCallback callback  codepre  pThe codeStatcode class is a simple Javascript Overlay class codeJavaScriptObjectcode with some getters getName, etc I have a normal noncachable implementation codeRequestBuilderDataSourcecode of my DataSource which looks like the followingp  precodepublic class RequestBuilderDataSource implements DataSource      Override     public void fetchStatsListfinal FetchStatsListCallback callback            create RequestBuilderRequest, retrieve response and parse JSON          callback.onFetchStatsListstats           Override     public void fetchStatsDataListltStatgt stats,final FetchStatsDataCallback callback          String url  getStatUrlstats         create RequestBuilderRquest, retrieve response and parse JSON         callback.onFetchStatsdataTable dataTable is of type DataTable       codepre  pI left out most of the code for the RequestBuilder as it is quite straightforward.p  pThis works out of the box however the list of stats and also the data is retrieved everytime even tough the data is shared among each widget instance. p  pFor supporting caching I add a codeCachecode interface and two Cache implementations one for HTML5 localStorage and one for HashMapp  precodepublic interface Cache      void putObject key, Object value     Object getObject key     void removeObject key     void clear  codepre  pI add a new class codeRequestBuilderCacheDataSourcecode which extends the codeRequestBuilderDataSourcecode and takes a codeCachecode instance in its constructor.p  precodepublic class

Negative 70479 pIm looking for advice, as I havent had to deal with large file parsing before and would like to avoid reinventing the wheel if an open source solution already exists. Heres my situationp  pI have roughly 200300 large XML and text files being dropped in a directory by an automated machine process in the lab I work in. This happens on a regular basis. These files can range in size from a few hundred MB to multiple GBs in size. These files are regularly modified couple times a week at random intervals where the old file is simply overwritten with the modified one.p  pI need the ability to search these files and pull out records that match specific criteria. Of the roughly 2030 million records in the files combined, we might actually use lt 100,000 of them, but we cant tell which ones until they are searched. p  pMy first thought it to setup a sort of regular file processing job that detects updates and processes the files into a database that can be searched. My only concern would be that it would probably get slower and slower to insert and update the records as it got larger and larger. p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions on a method that might be more suitable for my situation Off the top of my head I was thinking some text searching system like Lucene, but having never used it Im not positive if it would be anymore useful than a database...p  pAny help would be much appreciated.p

S will return the duration in seconds e.g. 86464 seconds M will return the duration in minutes e.g. 1441 minutes H will return the duration in hours e.g. 24 hours H M S will return the duration in hours, minutes and seconds 24h 1m 4s H S will return the duration in hours and seconds 24h 64s ... codepre  pI mean I could probably work out what I mean with just these few examples given, but theres no formal explanation or anything in there.p  pstrongFor claritystrongbr The issue Im trying to address is that you can combine any of the flags seconds, hours, days, months, etc. and the program will intelligently give you a result.  Like codeY dcode would give you a year and the number of days in the range 0 to 365 whereas codeY m dcode would give you the days in the range 0 to 30 because the rest is captured in the month.p  pExample codeY dcode gives code1 year 90 dayscode whereas codeY w dcode gives code1 year 12 weeks 6 dayscodep

Negative 70479 pIs there an equivalent of Linux epoll in Javap  pepoll allows a thread to react to a number of heterogenous events.  For instance, I can have a thread that reacts to either a socket event or an input from the console.  In C I can implement this by registering stdio and the socket with epoll.  My thread will be triggered by an event from either if these.p  pIs there a similar facility in Java  I looked at the nio package, it allows me to register a number of sockets with a selector.  But there does not seem to be away to register the console  standard io with a selector.  Am I not seeing something  Is there another way to do thisp  pOn the why I want to write a program that communicates via sockets, and i want to drive this program by entering commands from console.

Negative 70479 pI have custom views and buttons that I have added as subviews of my UINavigationBar. Their frames are set such that they begin halfway down the nav bar and extend past the normal bounds of the nav bar. I also have another subview that from time to time must be displayed as a modal looking view, but on the iPhone. To achieve this I have set his frame to 0,0,320,480 and added him as a subview of the nav bar. Everything LOOKS ok, but user interaction is disabled on the section of the view that is displayed below the nav bar, i.e. 0,44,320,456. p  pSimilar situations arise with my other objects. How can I enable user interaction with these views Is there a way to do this in the opposite manner such as having a view begin in the nav controllers view and extend upward to cover the nav bar i.e. 0,44,320,480 p  pSeems like a simple task but I have tried everything I can think of, including toggling showing  hiding the nav bar with  without animation to make it get out of the way, but there is a button that I need to show only as part of the navigation bar and it needs to sit on top of an actual uinavigationbar.p  pAny help appreciated.p  pThanks, Arashp

Negative 70479 pIm just having an issue Im hoping someone will be able to give me a few pointers. I have an asp page which is programatically creating multiple gridviews on the same aspx page depending on a variable set of values retrieved from the database. p  pAs I am programmatically creating the GridView in code behind, I have to create the gridview gridviews each time the page loads, on postback, oninit etc. I currently create the gridviews within the OnInit function of the page. This all works fine except for when the user goes into row edit mode then clicks the Update row update buttonlink. This forces a postback on the grid which reloads the grid values from database before their values are updated thus preventing the RowUpdating event from ever launching. How do I get around this I have tried capturing the command selected via the RowCommand event but this event only gets fired after the postback, so the oninit function gets called first before the Rowcommand so the command name Ive captured is of little use to me.p  pI am creating the GridView as follows in the Oninit functionp  precode    GridViewLineItem  New GridView     If bEnableEdit  True Then         GridViewLineItem.AutoGenerateEditButton  True     End If      If bEnableDelete  True Then         GridViewLineItem.AutoGenerateDeleteButton  True     End If      GridViewLineItem.AutoGenerateColumns  False     GridViewLineItem.EnableViewState  True     GridViewLineItem.Font.Name  Arial     GridViewLineItem.Font.Size  8     GridViewLineItem.ForeColor  Drawing.Color.Black     GridViewLineItem.BackColor  Drawing.Color.White     GridViewLineItem.BorderColor  Drawing.Color.LightGray     GridViewLineItem.BorderStyle  BorderStyle.None     GridViewLineItem.BorderWidth  1     GridViewLineItem.CellPadding  4     GridViewLineItem.AlternatingRowStyle.BackColor  Drawing.Color.White     GridViewLineItem.FooterStyle.BackColor  Drawing.Color.BurlyWood     GridViewLineItem.HeaderStyle.BackColor  Drawing.Color.DarkGray     GridViewLineItem.HeaderStyle.Font.Bold  True     GridViewLineItem.HeaderStyle.ForeColor  Drawing.Color.Black     GridViewLineItem.PagerStyle.BackColor  Drawing.Color.Beige     GridViewLineItem.PagerStyle.ForeColor  Drawing.Color.Black     GridViewLineItem.PagerStyle.HorizontalAlign  HorizontalAlign.Right     GridViewLineItem.RowStyle.BackColor  Drawing.Color.Beige     GridViewLineItem.ID  LineItemGridView  strItemID      strCBItemID  strItemID        AddHandler GridViewLineItem.RowEditing, AddressOf GridViewLineItemRowEditing     AddHandler GridViewLineItem.RowCancelingEdit, AddressOf GridViewLineItemRowCancelingEdit     AddHandler GridViewLineItem.RowDataBound, AddressOf GridViewLineItemRowDataBound     AddHandler GridViewLineItem.RowUpdating, AddressOf GridViewLineItemRowUpdating     AddHandler GridViewLineItem.PageIndexChanging, AddressOf GridViewLineItemPageIndexChanging     AddHandler GridViewLineItem.PreRender, AddressOf GridViewLineItemPreRender     AddHandler GridViewLineItem.PageIndexChanged, AddressOf GridViewLineItemPageIndexChanged     AddHandler GridViewLineItem.RowDeleting, AddressOf GridViewLineItemOnDeleting     AddHandler GridViewLineItem.RowCommand, AddressOf GridViewLineItemRowCommand        bind data source     dt  New DataTable     oda  New OleDb.OleDbDataAdapter     oda.Filldt, rsGroup     GridViewLineItem.DataSource  dt     GridViewLineItem.DataBind      Add gridview to page          tCell.Controls.AddGridViewLineItem     tRow.Cells.AddtCell     TableLineItem.Rows.AddtRow       LineItemPanel.Controls.AddTableLineItem     LineItemPanel.BorderStyle  BorderStyle.Solid     LineItemPanel.BorderWidth  3     LineItemPanel.BorderColor  Drawing.Color.DarkGray      tGroupRow  New TableRow     tGroupCell  New TableCell      tGroupCell.ColumnSpan  TableGroupDetails.Rows.Item0.Cells.Count     tGroupCell.Controls.AddLineItemPanel      tGroupRow.Cells.AddtGroupCell       TableGroupDetails.Rows.AddtGroupRow codepre  pCan someone plese give me some pointers in how I should skip the databind of the gridview when the user clicks on the row update I cant tie the Gridviews Databind indisriminately around a page.IsPostback  false as if I do this, The grid will only be loaded once and another other valid postsbacks such as when the user clicks on to get into row edit mode would cause an empty grid.p  pThanksp  pThanks a million SomeGuy Moving the GridView bind to Page.PreRender resolved the issue.

Negative 70479 pIm just getting started with MVC and have my first project under development. Ive been trying to wrap my head around an issue with my viewmodel and a domain object.p  pMy view model consists of a customer object and an address object. The problem is, even though all the properties of the customer and address display on the view, I can only save changes if I explicitly define each property in the view model. In other words, I need to duplicate the properties of the customer and address objects in the view model. This solves all my problems.p  pMy question is, do I need to explicitly define each property in the view model or is there a way I can just define the view model with a Customer property of type Customer and an Address property of type Address which would be much simplerp  pBased on I what Im finding online, I think the answer is I must define each property in the view model. If that is correct, are there any ways to automatically do this mapping for mep  pASP.NET MVC 4p

Negative 70479 pI have a book called Zen of Assembly by Michael Abrash. All the code listings, as far as I         know, are in x86 Assembly. I downloaded WinASM and MASM so I could assemble and link these listings. However, the listings dont work out of the box  in fact, I cant get them to work at all. For example, here is the code for the first listingp  hr  precode   Listing 21    The precision Zen timer PZTIMER.ASM   Uses the 8253 timer to time the performance of code that takes  less than about 54 milliseconds to execute, with a resolution  of better than 10 microseconds.   By Michael Abrash 42689   Externally callable routines    ZTimerOn Starts the Zen timer, with interrupts disabled.    ZTimerOff Stops the Zen timer, saves the timer count,    times the overhead code, and restores interrupts to the    state they were in when ZTimerOn was called.    ZTimerReport Prints the net time that passed between starting    and stopping the timer.   Note If longer than about 54 ms passes between ZTimerOn and    ZTimerOff calls, the timer turns over and the count is    inaccurate. When this happens, an error message is displayed    instead of a count. The longperiod Zen timer should be used    in such cases.   Note Interrupts MUST be left off between calls to ZTimerOn    and ZTimerOff for accurate timing and for detection of    timer overflow.   Note These routines can introduce slight inaccuracies into the    system clock count for each code section timed even if    timer 0 doesnt overflow. If timer 0 does overflow, the    system clock can become slow by virtually any amount of    time, since the system clock cant advance while the    precison timer is timing. Consequently, its a good idea    to reboot at the end of each timing session. The    batterybacked clock, if any, is not affected by the Zen    timer.   All registers, and all flags except the interrupt flag, are  preserved by all routines. Interrupts are enabled and then disabled  by ZTimerOn, and are restored by ZTimerOff to the state they were  in when ZTimerOn was called.

The book, Zen of Assembly, is more than twenty years old so it was designed and written to be run on a slightly different processor but I was under the impression most processors are completely backwards compatible so I thought that wouldnt be an issue. Anyways, does anyone know whats causing these error messages Obviously theyre linker errors, its assembling fine, so that gives me the idea that something isnt quite right with the linker MASM came with  should I download a new one or somethingp  pBy the way, Im on a 32 bit OS, not a 64 bit one, and Im running Windows 7.

Negative 70479 pI am using jQuerys load function to get template data from external html files. In most cases I prefer to storage the data in a variable and append it when I need to later on.

Negative 70479 pIm thinking to write a simple research paper manager.  The idea is to have a repository containing for each paper its metadatap  precodepaperid gt [title, authors, journal, comments...] codepre  pSince it would be nice to have the possibility to import the paper dump of a friend, Im thinking on how to generate the paperid of a paper IMHO should be produced by the text of the pdf, to garantee that two different collections have the same ids only for the same papers.  At the moment, I extract the text of the first page using the iText library removing the possible annotations, and i compute a simhash footprint from the text.  the main problem is that sometime text is slightly different yes, it happens for example a hrefhttpwww.chato.clpapersboldi2008queryflowgraph.pdf relnofollowthisa and a hrefhttpvigna.di.unimi.itftppapersQueryFlowGraph.pdf relnofollowthisa so i would like to be tolerant. With simhash i can compute how much the are similar the original document, so in case the footprint is not in the repo, ill have to iterate over the collection looking for  near footprints.p  pIm not convinced by this method, could you suggest some better way to produce a signature short, numerical or alphanumerical for those kind of documentsp  pstrongUPDATEstrong I had this idea divide the first page in 8 more or less notoverlapping squares, covering all the page, then consider the text in each square and generate a simhash signature. At the end Ill have a 8x64512bit signature and I can consider two papers the same if the sum of the differences between their simhash signatures sets is under a certain treshold. p

Negative 70479 pI have a piece of Haskell code that looks like thisp  precodefst . f  Z . i div 2 codepre  pcodeZcode and code.code are taken from a hrefhttphackage.haskell.orgpackagerepa3.2.2.2Repaa library and are defined like thisp  precodedata Z  Z deriving Show, Read, Eq, Ord infixl 3 .  data tail . head  tail . head deriving Show, Read, Eq, Ord codepre  pThe expression right of codecode defines an array index, while codefcode is a function that takes that index and returns a pair.

Negative 70479 pIve created a custom subclass of UIViewController that acts like a UINavigationController or a UITabBarController. Lets call it a ToolbarNavController. It has a toolbar at the bottom with controls for the user to move to a different content view.p  pI have two content views aside from the ToolbarNavControllers view. Both are loaded from a nib and have their own controllers. The app starts out showing one of them. A button in the toolbar allows the user to switch between them.p  pWhen I add these views as subviews of the ToolbarNavControllers views in viewDidLoad, they are correctly resized to fill the area between the status bar and the toolbar without overlapunderlap.p  pBut when I try to lazy load the second view, adding it as a subview for the first time only when the user presses the toolbar button, iOS does not resize the view to account for the toolbar in its parent view, and it underlaps the toolbar which messes up my Autolayout constraints. Also, when I dont add the subview in viewDidLoad, if I put the device in landscape orientation before switching to the second view, it loads with a portrait orientation frame.p  pstrongBottom linestrong When inserting a subview in viewDidLoad, iOS sizes it correctly and manages autorotation for it. When inserting it later, I need to detect orientation set the frame myself. And for some reason when I do this, autorotation kicks in again.p  pWhat is going onp

Negative 70479 pI have a relatively large legacy PerlCGIDBI web application which generates HTML onthefly piece by piece. We are reworking the HTML being produced, to come in to compliance with HTML 5  CSS 3. This would be a good time to move to some sort of template system. We do NOT want to engage in a complete rewrite, and thus do NOT want to migrate to a framework such as Catalyst.p  pIm thinking that Perl Template Toolkit might be our lowestimpact means. Im rereading the venerable Badger Book to study up on feasibility.p  pMy question is this. Has anyone here migrated old school Perl web code to Template Toolkit Are there any tricks you can share for minimizing the rewriterework needed We have not 100 decided on Template Toolkit, either. If there is an alternative which we should considerp  pWhat problem, specifically, are we trying to solve Were generating invalid HTML and need to clean that up. Since were cleaning, we want to produce fullyvalid HTML 5 and, to the extent practicable, valid CSS3 and Javascript. We use jQuery, jQuery UI widgets, and AJAX via jQuery. We have typical Page Controller MVC architecture except no View layer as such. Wed like to go to some sort of template system but dont want to rewrite everything or much of anything to migrate.p  pThank You Ed Barnard, Cannon Falls MNp
Negative 70479 pBasically i want to implement Session Management in my application having a Session Timeout of 1 hour.That is i want to show a popup 15 minues before Session timeout.p  pIn my .NET application there is a home page and from that home page other child pages are getting opened by clicking on different links present on the Home page.Now The session Timeout warning popup can be displayed by implementing a timer by writing a cient side script code and using the javascipt method setinterval on the home page.p  pBut the problem arises when the user goes to any child pagewindow from the Home page and refreshes the session ids by hitting the server by fetching data from database from that child page. But the session timeout warning timer implmented on the home page displays the warning popup even if the Session has been refreshed by activities done on the child page. As i cannot implement timer on every cild pages because it is a vast application having numerous child and nested chld pages, so what i want to ask is that strongcan we fire an event on the home pagestrong to reset the session timeout timer strongwhenever the server is hitstrong  p  pIf we can do it , then my job is donep

Negative 70479 pThis is my first question ever so bear with mep  pCurrently in my program, I have a parent widget which acts as a canvas. The user can add or remove widgets to the parent at runtime. Those widgets are then given an absolute position, that is, they are not positioned by a layout. Once added, a widget can be moved around arbitrarily by the user.p  pI want the user to be able to select a group of widgets by dragging a box around them. I have already coded the part that displays the rectangle while the user is dragging. Now, I want to be able to retrieve all the widgets within that rectangle region.p  pI am aware of the findChild and findChildren functions, and they indeed do return the children as they are supposed to. But what Id really need is a way to limit the search to the boundaries of the region since there will mostlikely be quite a lot of widgets within the canvas. There could be thousands of widgets spread over a very large area due to the nature of what Im doingp  pstrongHere is my questionstrong What would be my best option Should I just go ahead and use findChildren and loop through the list to find the children within the region manually. Or should I loop through all the pixels within the region using findChildx, y Or perhaps there is an even simpler solution that would speed up the process Something along the lines of findChildrenx, y, width, heightp  pHopefully my question made sense.

Im using JBoss 5.1 web server and NetBeans 7.2 IDE. p  pI have the following problemsp  ol lipI cannot start application in Debug mode. That I know of, there are two best approaches in NetBeans and Java Remote debugging and debugging via shared memory. I read this post a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5337787howtodebugjbossapplicationinnetbeansHow to debug JBOSS application in netbeansa and I set debug parameters in Jboss configurationI also know there are different parameter sets for shared memory and remote debugging, but when I go to attach debugger I got following errors p  ul lipIf I use remote debugging I got error Connection refused pli lipIf I use shared memory I got error similar to this text dtshmemfile path could not be found. pli ulli ol  pThese errors occur when I start JBoss by running run.bat file.

However, I still have strange problem with Managed Bean properties. I have select list on page, and it is connected to Boolean property. When nothing is selected it should be set to null value by default and it is when I start JBoss server by running run.bat file, but its value is by default set to false I checked parameters post values in firebug and there is no problem in posting parameters to bean. It looks to me that problem is when JSF framework is trying to map post values to Managed Beans properties, but I cannot find out why this is happening. I also checked facesconfig.xml, but did not find any specific rule for mapping to this specific property. Any tipsp

Also the problem I observed also in Cocos2d example projects  simple all the memory for textures is doubled. p  pbelow two screeshots  one from cocos2d app , shows two textures 600KB each displayed in the profiler as FOUR allocated objects  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comYfx5c.jpg altenter image description herep  pand custom allocated and created texture directly with openGL and image supplied via libpng  displayed as live two objects 1Mb each. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgBnWh.jpg altenter image description herep  pI would appreciate if anyone could enlighten me on this one.

Negative 70479 pIm currently working on some Planet Generation mainly for fun and hoping to end up with some kick ass planets. Im using a Cube which has been mapped into a sphere by normalization. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgq8hf.jpg altplanet terrain and skyp  pThe terrain isnt textured properly yet in this picture. This is just the render from the Heightmap. However this is not my problem. When creating a sphere from a cube you are left with 6 faces bent to the shape of a sphere. Therefore, I do not have latitude and longitude that can be used to wrap a spherical heightmap around the terrain. Currently Im using Cube Mapping. However, this has caused several problems, as you can see img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9o4AA.jpg altcubetosphere mapping problems mdashwhere my problem becomes obvious. The problem is due to the fact that the sphere still has the topology of a cube. I have to generate a heightmap for each face. I use Libnoise currently for the heightmap and this is where the big problem starts. I can either export it as a spherical heightmapmdashwhich would be useful if i had a spheremdashor I can use planar heightmaps which must be mapped to all 6 faces. However, due to how the mapping works. I can get 3 faces to line up around the middle and be seamless but the last heightmap wont join to the first as Lib noise uses bounds and creates a grid of coordinates.p  pThe sphere is created like somdashp  precodeforint i  0 i lt vertices.size i       glmvec3 oldVec  vertices[i]     glmvec3 newVec  glmnormalizeoldVec     vertices[i]  newVec  glmvec3500, 500, 500  codepre  pThe reasoning behind this can be seen a hrefhttpmathproofs.blogspot.co.uk200507mappingcubetosphere.html relnofollowherea.p  pHowever, the structure of the sphere will make it easier to implement lod in the form of a QuadTtee later on. Is there anyway I can generate a cube map heightmap with LibNoise Or is there something I can do to make the sphere be able to use a sphereical heightmapp  pI figured out how to make it render using Sphere Maps but this isnt going to work when i come to using a quad tree. However, it produces some nice results likep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3e4at.jpg altenter image description herep  pSo, i pretty much i need to know how to tile noise into a cube map. Either with Libnoise or in the vertex shader.p

Negative 70479 pDid a quick search and couldnt find the answer Ive been looking for. So I have a vb.net windows application which uses RDLC to generate invoice, delivery order, price list and other documents. To reduce server load as much as possible, information will only be pulled once from the server and it includes order items, price and other necessary data.p  pOnce the data is pulled in xml it will be filled into a dataset which will be used in generating various reports. Note that this same dataset is used in multiple RDLC reports to display different information.p  pSo the problem in my case is that I cannot do a SELECT DISTINCT from the SQL level because the same set of data will also be used generate the invoice, but I also need to display a price list from the same dataset which only include distinct order items.p  pSo the options I havep  ol lipHave the RDLC to display distinct row, but I have no idea on how it can be achieved.pli lipFailing that, I might need to create another datatable in my xsd file using the existing dataset, separating the dataset into 2. Again, I have little idea on the details of execution.pli ol  pAny input is much appreciated. Thanksp

Negative 70479 pUsing an onclick function to turn on and off images, I have the images set with with id, and thats how Ive been turning them on and off. However I have 3 sets of images that need to be in a class. I would like to keep everything within on function. So as not to have two onclick functions. Im also having trouble increasing and decreasing the values of the images that will be in the class.

Negative 70479 pI have a problem.p  pI have two matrix nbdnew and nbdold which stores the linear index nos of a 2D matrix like phinew and phiold. Both phiold amp phinew are of the same size. What I need to do is to calculate all the positions that are in the set nbdnew but not in the set nbdold. Then for each such position I have to update the phinew in this way  If phiold for that position is larger than 0, then put phinew at that position  width1 else put phinew at that position  width1p  pI have written a code like this  p  precode    C  setdiffnbdnew,nbdold     for k1lengthC         if phioldCkgt0             phinewCkwidth1         else             phinewCkwidth1         end     end codepre  pThis code works but is extremely slow due to the loops and ifthenelse statement. Can this code be optimized any further  p  pThanks all in advance p  pEDIT Please do check that phiold and phinew are both 2D matrixs and the matrix C is the set of linear indexing positions of this matrixs. I am sorry if I was not clear beforehand. By mistake, I wrote u instead of phi. Both are same. p

Im wondering if EJB application server supports error tracking after the deployment.  br For example, When you deploy your EJB application in real world, sometime, even with very tiny probability, your system can still make mistake because of Services e.g in transaction, concurrency,... vertical,horizontal services or business EJBs in general that affect system performance. In that case, the whole system may be stopped or not. My question is that Does EJB application server support any error tracking API to recognize and record all information about these error  br br All mistakes about logic programming are not concerned. br br Thank you and sorry for my bad English.p

Negative 70479 pI am trying to determine if it is possible to take arrow keys and convert them to wide characters.

Negative 70479 pPer traditional POSIX, codeerrnocode is simply an integer lvalue, which works perfectly well with codeforkcode, but oviously doesnt work nearly as well with threads. As per pthreads, codeerrnocode is a threadlocal integer lvalue. Under LinuxNTPL, as an implementation detail, errno is some macro that expands to a function returning an integer lvalue.p  pOn my Debian system, this seems to be codeerrnolocation code, on some other systems Ive seen things like codeampgettibgterrnumcode.p  pstrongTLDRstrongbr Assuming Ive used codeclonecode to create a thread, can I just call codeerrnocode and expect that it will work, or do I have to do some special rain dance For example, do I need to read some special field in the thread information block, or some special TLS value, or, do I get to set the address of the threadlocal variable where the glibc stores the error values somehow Something like codeseterrnolocationcode maybep  pOr, will it just work as it isp  pInevitably, someone will be tempted to reply simply use phtreads  please dont. I do not want to use pthreads. I want codeclonecode. I do not want any of the illadvised functionality of pthreads, and I do not want to deal with any of its quirks, nor do I want the overhead to implement those quirks. I recognize that much of the crud in pthreads comes from the fact that it has to work and, surprisingly, it emsuccessfullyem works amongst others for some completely broken systems that are nearly three decades old, but that doesnt mean that it is necessarily a good thing for everyone and every situation. Portability is not of any concern in this case.br All I want in this particular situation is fire up another process running in the same address space as the parent, synchronization via a simple lock say, a futex, and codewritecode working properly which means I emalsoem have to be able to read codeerrnocode correctly. As little overhead as possible, no other functionality or special behavior needed or even desired.p

Negative 70479 pI have script which can be run by any user who is connected to a server.  This script writes to a single log file, but there is no restriction on who can use it at one time.  So multiple people could attempt to write to the log and data might be lost.  Is there a way for one instance of the code to know if other instances of that code are running  Moreover, is it possible to gather this information dynamically ie not allow data saving for the second user until the first user has completed hesher taskp  pI know I could do this with a text file.  So I could write the user name to the file when the start, then delete it when they finish, but this could lead to errors if the either step misses, such as an unexpected script termination.  So what other reliable ways are therep  pSome information on the system Python 2.7 is installed on a Windows 7 64bit server via Anaconda. All connected machines are also Windows 7 64bit.

Negative 70479 pand thank you for reading thisp  pI may be looking right past the answer for this, or it may be that it was never designed to happen since ValidationSummary is clientside logic, but is there any way to retrieve the error text of a validation summary field in ASP.NET from the C codebehind The goal here is to construct a message that includes various information entered by the user, plus any errors that might be preventing that user from completing an operation.p  pIts fine if it cant be done since I am not expecting client side validation to be much of an issue for users in this program, but it would be nice to include for the sake of completion. Any advice would be appreciated.p  pThank youp

Negative 70479 pIm using the PubNub API with Java for pulling data from MtGox.p  pWhen retrieving data, the API delivers it in form of a codeJSONObjectcode, which represents a tree structure of JSON data.

Negative 70479 pWorking on a simple tictactoe game in Java.p  pI have a class named codeTicTacToecode, which contains most of the program. And I have a class named codeGameHelperscode, which should contain methods to help with the game.p  pClass codeTicTacToecode contains an array codeJButton buttons[9]code, and an codeint countcode variable that stores how many Xs and Os the user has put on the screen already. Each time the user clicks a button, its blank text changes to an X or an O, and the count variable goes count.p  pCurrently, the only method I plan to write inside codeGameHelperscode, is a method named coderesetGamecode. This method should do two thingsbr 1 Set the text on all the buttons in codebuttonscode blank.br 2 Set codecountcode to 0.p  pIf coderesetGamecode was a method inside codeTicTacToecode, it would be easy.

Negative 70479 pstrongProblem Summarystrong I am attempting to serialize a hash to JSON using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comohler55oj relnofollowOj gema. It seems that Oj does not automatically convert the symbol keys of the hash to strings. I am wondering if Oj has an option to stringify during serializationp  pThis is an example of my hashp  precodeexamplehash    idgt1234,   assetnumbergt12345678,   latitudegt34.78495,   longitudegt92.12899,   lasttrackingrecordidgt123456789,   bearinggt42,   threatlevelgtsevere codepre  pAnd the above is rendered like sop  precoderender json Oj.dumpexamplehash codepre  pThe resulting JSON unfortunately has keys that look exactly like the above, meaning I would need to access elements in JavaScript like so coderesponse[assetnumber]code. Since the clientside code was implemented months ago, and have only now added Oj, I would prefer to find a way to stringify the keys during serialization serverside.p  pOj has an option called codesymbolkeyscode, which is a boolean, however setting it to either codetruecode or codefalsecode seems to have no effect in this regard.p  pThe only solution I have found thus far is to use codewithindifferentaccesscode as suggested in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma10549699877472this answera, however in some cases I have arrays of hashes while I can technically invoke that method for each hash in that array, given that Oj is meant to speed up Json serialization I would prefer to find a way to do this with Oj itself. Ultimately, I wonder if there is an option or setting in Oj that will perform this emduringem serialization.p

However, the answer says to download and build the entire android source code because the tests here  a hrefhttpsandroid.googlesource.complatformframeworksbaserefsheadsgingerbreadreleaseopengltests relnofollowhttpsandroid.googlesource.complatformframeworksbaserefsheadsgingerbreadreleaseopengltestsa  such as  a hrefhttpsandroid.googlesource.complatformframeworksbaserefsheadsgingerbreadreleaseopengltestsglbasicglbasic.cpp relnofollowhttpsandroid.googlesource.complatformframeworksbaserefsheadsgingerbreadreleaseopengltestsglbasicglbasic.cppa  have dependencies such as include p  pI want to build the application ideally with the NDK, but if necessary I could build it on Ubuntu.p  pglbasic.cpp would be great, except I dont want to have to download and build the entire Android source code just to build such a tiny program glbasic.cpp is only 364 lines of codep  pI tried to build glbasic.cpp with ndkbuild.cmd, but I get FramebufferNativeWindow.h not found...  And then if I keep downloading more header files to my local project, I eventually run into link errors.  I wonder if there is an easier way to build something like glbasic.cpp Android OpenGL executable with a main function using the NDK.p  pPS I know the normal way to write Android apps is to create an APK, but I dont want to do that  I want a standalone Linux executable with main and OpenGL that I can run from the Android Terminal Emulator application that runs inside Android...  On x86 based Android not ARM.p  pAlso let me add that I know you can put include BUILDEXECUTABLE in the Android.mk file and APPABI  x86 in the Application.mk file.  I have no problem building an Android executable with ndkbuild.cmd that runs from Android Terminal Emulator on x86 Android and prints hello world with printf.p  pThe thing I have a problem with is creating such an executable with OpenGL.  I think part of the magic is FramebufferNativeWindow.h, but that has its own includes too...  Im wondering if I can build something similar to glbasic.cpp with ndkbuild.cmd or even with make and gcc on Ubuntu that will run in Android Terminal Emulator...  But I dont want to have to download and build the entire Android source tree.p  pSummary how do I create a native window with headers and libraries that are included in the NDK  I know it can be done by calling androidcreateDisplaySurface from libui.  However, libui is not included as part of the NDK.  So how can I create a native window for use by EGL and OpenGL from the NDK with pure C no Java code  eglCreateWindowSurfaces 3rd arg is NativeWindowType, so I need to create a NativeWindow somehow.p  pSummary My ultimate goal is to write a C executable with a main function that draws an OpenGL triangle, that I can run on Android x86 console mode.  No Java.p

Negative 70479 pWe have a web application which tracks the child windows that are open, we have a start page which when closed, has a requirement that all child windows need to be closed.p  pThe following is the structure A Start Page B  Module Page C  Sub Module Pagep  pWe have a javascript array on the Start Page which holds the references of the child windows, so that when the Start Page is closed, we can use the page references to close the respective child windows.p  pThis system worked so far till IE 8, but due to new security restrictions in IE 9 we assume, we have not been able to maintain the system.p  pFrom A we open a child module page, and set the add the reference in the Start Page. From B if we open child module page, using window.opener we add the child reference to the Start Page. However if we redirect to another page in the Module Page B, the child reference gets lost or cannot be accessed or access is denied.p  pThis however does not happen in IE8, so we could still use the references to close the window. If we could somehow refresh the child references to C even after B has been redirected to another page, without calling window.open.p  pNeed some help on this guys.p

So basically, they move the same, but have different locations. I dont understand why as the trail.position has a cgpoint make of the center of the player.p  pAny reasons whyp
Negative 70479 pFirst things first, Im brand new here and Im hoping that this adheres to your guidelines for questions. I dont believe other questionsthreads here would be applicable at least they didnt appear to be. p  pAnyways, Im a programming novice taking a C class in college. The assignment Im working on has to do with the Split method. Im supposed to ask the user for names and bowling scores in a textbox, split it into a temporary array, then take the appropriate index values from the temporary Array and place them in Name and Score arrays. It should handle up to 10 players, but it should work for fewer than that partially filled array. p  pIt will calculate and output the high score  who has it, the low score  who has it, and the average score, as well as outputting all the names and scores. I want to reject any entered scores that arent between 0 and 300 before they enter the array, but when I enter a value outside of that range and debug, it says that the greater thanless than equal to is true. Obviously, if I enter 9001 or 3 etc. as a score Id want it to be rejected. Here is that part of the code.p  precode        public void GetSplitstring stg                   string[] tempArray          Split the temp array         tempArray  stg.Split              Professor said a for loop would be unnecessary since its a GUI               LOW  300              ifscore[index] lt LOW ampamp score[index] gt 0             this part here is returning true when it should be false                  1st score is in the 2nd slot in tempArray                 if input is not between 0300 and is NOT an integer, yell at them                 if int.TryParsetempArray[1], out score[index]                                       MessageBox.ShowYELLINT                     return                                   bool status  int.TryParsetempArray[1], out score[index]  true false                 1st name is in 1st slot in tempArray                 name[index]  tempArray[0]                          codepre  pIf anyone has a solution as to how or why this isnt working, as well as an example on how to get it to work even a redirect to another answered question thats similar to the one Im asking that I missed, thatd awesome.

Negative 70479 pIm working on an AngularJS project yo angular scaffolding that uses Grunt, Bootstrap, and some things that depend on Bootstrap like angularstrap.  I have a custom variables.less file for Bootstrap that I am trying to use.p  pWhile I certainly can have my own copy of Bootstrap 3, and can compile my own bootstrap.css using my variables.less file, the bowerInstall task in Grunt always ensures that my index.html file is updated to also point to the Bower Bootstrap packages CSS files.p  pBootstrap is already a pretty heavy payload, so I certainly dont want two of them  which is what Im seeing.  When I builddist with Grunt and eventually with my Cordova build process, I see that both my copy of Bootstrap and Bowers are included.  That causes me problems.p  pSo what I need is a way to get Bower to accept that I have Bootstrap 3 covered and to ignore that dependency for other Bower components.  Otherwise Im forced to put my custom LESS file in the Bower Bootstrap folder, which is a nono.p  pAny thoughtsp  pUPDATEp  pRobins answer below dealt with my problem here perfectly.  What I didnt know was that I was also having a problem with cssmin in Grunt.  Even though my index.html no longer had both my and Bowers Bootstrap CSS listed due to Robins solution, I still ended up with a main.css that included two copies of minified bootstrap.css.  One was based on my raw version, the other copy coming from the .tmp folder that was used by Grunts autoprefixer and rev tasks.  The way my index.html was configured, cssmin was pulling in the processed version of bootstrap.css in .tmp as well as my original, which caused a doubly sized minified file.  The line in question in index.html looked like thisp  precodelt buildcss.tmp,app stylesmain.css gt codepre  pChanging it to this fixed the doubling problemp  precodelt buildcss.tmp stylesmain.css gt codepre  pThough it still left me with the glyphicons breaking, which is another problem in and of itself that I partially dealt with by no longer minifying bootstrap.css.p

Negative 70479 pIm building a website in ASP.NET where people can add excercises to a fitness schedule.  Basically a person presses add new schedule and then puts in how many days he wants to go to the gym. I use codeajax.loadcode in different divs so the person doesnt have to see 50 different pages because I prefer to offer a dynamic way to make the schedule.p  pFor example u want to go to the gym 3 days a week. 3 buttons day 1 , day 2 , day 3 will appear. A div with a GridView of all the excercises will be loaded with the codeajax.loadcode function. p  pMy list is pretty big so I made a search button so u can filter the GridView. The problem I have stumbled upon is that when you give in your search criteria and press the button, the GridView gets updated but the entire page gets refreshed and my excersises become the entire page. So my day buttons are gone which is a big problem obviously.p  pMy question is can u update a gridview with a search button WITHOUT it causing to refresh so it just stays in the div and doesnt take over the entire page.p  pMY ASP.CODE  p  precode    ltaspScriptManager IDScriptManager1 runatservergtltaspScriptManagergt  ltaspUpdatePanel IDUpdatePanel1 runatservergt   ltContentTemplategt         ltbr gt   ltdiv idlaadoefeningengt    ltaspTextBox IDtxtSearch  runatserver placeholderZoek OefeninggtltaspTextBoxgt     ltaspButton IDbtnSearch runatserver TextZoeken gt     ltbr gt       ltbr gt            ltaspTextBox IDtxtgebruikersid Visiblefalse CssClassTxtStyle runatservergtltaspTextBoxgt     ltaspTextBox IDtxtdag Visiblefalse CssClassTxtStyle runatservergtltaspTextBoxgt         ltaspGridView IDgrdOefeningen AutoGenerateColumnsfalse EnableViewStatefalse runatservergt             ltColumnsgt                     ltaspBoundField DataFieldOefNaam HeaderTextNaam                          SortExpressionOefNaam gt                     ltaspBoundField DataFieldOefBeschrijving HeaderTextBeschrijving                          SortExpressionBeschrijving gt                 ltaspTemplateField HeaderTextToevoegen  ItemStyleFontUnderlinetruegt     ltItemTemplategt  lta hrefclasstoevoegenhref idoeflt EvalOefIdgtgtToevoegenltagt      ltItemTemplategt ltaspTemplateFieldgt             ltColumnsgt         ltaspGridViewgt      ltdivgt    ltContentTemplategt  ltaspUpdatePanelgt       ltscript typetextjavascriptgt          .toevoegenhref.onclick, function               var dag  lttxtdag.Textgt             var gebruikersid  lttxtgebruikersid.textgt             var oefid  this.id.replaceoef,               laadoefeningen.load..schemaschemaoefdetail.aspxdag  dag  ampgebruikersid  gebruikersid  ampoefid  oefid  ampnewoefy                 ltscriptgt codepre  pp  pMY VB.NET CODE BEHIND ITp  precode Protected Sub PageLoadsender As Object, e As System.EventArgs Handles Me.Load     Dim obll As New clBLOefeningen     Dim queryStringDag As String  Request.QueryString.Getdag     Dim queryStringId As String  Request.QueryString.Getgebruikersid      Dim categorieSec As String      If Not Page.IsPostBack Then         loadgrid     End If End Sub  Protected Sub btnSearchClicksender As Object, e As System.EventArgs Handles btnSearch.Click      loadgrid  End Sub  Protected Sub loadgrid     Dim obll As New clBLOefeningen      If txtsearch.Text   Then         grdOefeningen.DataSource  obll.selectAll      Else         grdOefeningen.DataSource  obll.zoekoefeningtxtSearch.Text      End If     grdoefeningen.DataBind   End Sub codepre

Negative 70479 pHow do you get a Java combobox to accept the highlighted value when you type the Tab key, like it does when you type Enter I think of this as a UI norm, and have seen it on websites and desktop programs, so I dont understand why Java doesnt do it by default.  The escape key is there to cancel.p  pI found several related questions to this, including how to get Enter to behave like Tab, but it turned out harder to go the other way, so Ill post how I did it.  Perhaps I missed an easy wayp  pIn particular, a hrefhttpscommunity.oracle.comthread1363407start0amptstart0 relnofollow titleTAB selection of item of a JCombobox in a Jtable  Oracle Communitythe closest posting I could finda didnt work because the tab key was already consumed by the focus system.

Negative 70479 pIm performing logical delete when an item should be deleted from the database.p  pI have added an additional codeDateTimecode column to every table that we need to perform logical delete. So when deleting you just update the field like...p  precodeUPDATE Client  SET deleted  GETDATE  WHERE Client.CID  cid codepre  pLater if it should be recovered then...p  precodeUPDATE Client  SET deleted  NULL  WHERE Client.CID  cid codepre  pSo that a typical selection statement would look like...p  precodeSELECT   FROM client  WHERE CID  cid AND deleted IS NULL codepre  pBut the problem is how to handle dependencies to maintain the consistency of the database in this approach. For ex. before deleting actually updating an employee I have to do several checks such as to see whether there are any related attendance  Bank Accounts  Wages data History etc. in related tables pertaining to the employee being deleted.p  pSo that whats the normal practice in doing such things Do I need to check every thing in p  precodeIF EXISTS SELECT... codepre  pstatementsp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIf I want to prevent the update when it has related records I could do something like this using UNION...p  precodeIF NOT EXISTS SELECT empid FROM BankAccount WHERE empid  100 UNION SELECT EID FROM Attendance WHERE EID  100 UNION SELECT employeeid FROM SalaryTrans WHERE employeeid  100 UPDATE Employee SET Employee.deleted  GETDATE WHERE empid  100 codepre  pWould this be a acceptable solutionp

Negative 70479 pI realise this is a very specific question but I have limited knowledge of both SVG and telerik so here it goes.p  pI am trying to convert a RadHtmlChart to an image in an C. First to get the svg of the chart I use a built in telerik function.p  pcodevar chartRendering  findltBarChart.ClientID gt.getSVGStringcodep  pOnce I have that string on the server I attempt to convert it to a Memory stream representing the image. To do this I am using a hrefhttpsgithub.comvvvvSVG relnofollowhttpsgithub.comvvvvSVGap  precode   XmlDocument xml  new XmlDocument    xml.LoadXmlsvgText    SvgDocument svg  SvgDocument.Openxml       Convert SVG document containing image to Stream    MemoryStream imageStream  new MemoryStream    svg.Draw.SaveimageStream, ImageFormat.Png codepre  pThe last line is where the code breaks and gives the error ColorBlend object that was set is not valid. Positions last element must be equal to 1.0.  ColorBlend objects must be constructed with the same number of positions and color values.  Positions must be between 0.0 and 1.0, 1.0 indicating the last element in the array.p  pThe strange thing is that this only happens on some charts and not others. I have noticed that on one particular chart that if the chart as 10 or more x values then it is fine. But if there are less than 10 values then it breaks. I have also tried doing the same thing using temperorary files to store the svg and the image to the same result.p  pI have run out of ideas so does anybody have a suggestion Perhaps another way to get from svg to an image in c. Ive had a look at inkscape but I cant use it as it requires to be installed as an .exe on the server.p  pEDIT I found possible solution using javascript. Wont work for me as it uses the canvas element which is HTML5 and I need this to work in IE8 but in case anybody else stumbles across this.  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3975499convertsvgtoimagejpegpngetcinthebrowserConvert SVG to image JPEG, PNG, etc. in the browsera.p  pSOLUTION Ive decided to implement the javascript method shown above for all browsers that support HTML5 and the inkscape method for IE8.p

Negative 70479 pI have a combobox with codeVerticalContentAlignmentcode set to codeCentercode however it still does not appear to be center. I realized that the problem is that it is centering off of the lower case letters, not the text as a whole.

Negative 70479 pI am working to devise a objective function for a integer linear programming model. The goal is to determine the copy number of two genes as well as if a gene conversion event has happened where one copy is overwritten by the other, which looks like one was deleted but the net copy number has not changed.p  pThe problem involves two data vectors, codePAcode and codePBcode. The vectors contain continuous values larger than zero that correspond to a measure of copy number made at each position. codePA,icode is not necessarily the same spot across the gene as codePB,icode is, because the positions are unique to each copy and can be mapped to an absolute position in the genome.p  pGiven this, my plan was to try and minimize the difference between my decision variables and the measured data across different genome windows, giving me different slices of the two data vectors that correspond to the same region.p  pDecision variablesp  precodeAw  copy number of A in window in 0,1,2,3,4 Bw  copy number of B in window in 0,1,2,3,4 Cw  gene conversion in 2,1,0,1,2 codepre  pThe goal then would be to minimize the difference between the left and right sides of the below equationsp  precodeAw  Cw  meanPA,W Bw  Cw  meanPB,W codepre  pSubject to a handful of constraints such as code2 lt Aw  Bw lt 4codep  pBut I am unsure how to formulate this into a function to minimize.

Negative 70479 pI have a Model that is essentially an object that contains a list of objects that have three numeric fields and one string field, similar to the followingp  precodepublic class DataModel      public ListltDataItemModelgt DataItems  get set    public class DataModel      public string Comment  get set      public decimal Value  get set      public int ID  get set      public int IntegerValue  get set   codepre  pThe View has a table that allows the user to set each items codeValuecode and codeCommentcode fields codeIDcode is generated by the data layer and codeIntegerValuecode is derived from codeValuecode. The user can add and delete items from the collection via AJAX, using the jQuery codepostcode method, with the webpage being partially updated using codehtmlcode.p  pThe issue Im seeing is if I have a list of CommentValue pairs like sop  precodeItem 1, 1.00 Item 2, 2.00 Item 3, 3.00 Item 4, 4.00 Item 5, 5.00 codepre  pAnd I delete the third item via the webpage, the Controller correctly changes the data top  precodeItem 1, 1.00 Item 2, 2.00 Item 4, 4.00 Item 5, 5.00 codepre  pAnd returns the new HTML using codePartialViewcode. But when the webpage is updated, the model is somehow transformed to bep  precodeItem 1, 1.00 Item 2, 2.00 Item 3, 3.00 Item 4, 4.00 codepre  pI have confirmed this using VS2013s debugger and Firefoxs network packet analyser thing, but am completely at a loss as to how or why this happens. I dont think its a caching issue, as the jQuery docs say that codepostcode never caches by definition. I guess it has something to do witht he call to codePartialViewcodep  pstrongEditstrong The partial View in question is simply a table inside an HTML form, which is placed inside a codedivcode using jQuerys codehtmlcode method.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Ive done some more debugging, and have managed to eliminate the call to codePartialViewcode being at fault its definitely returning a correctly formed codePartialViewResultcode.p

Negative 70479 pI am having trouble reducing a matplotlib figures size with the TkAgg backend.  p  pFirst, let me show that I can increase a figures size.  After running the following code,p  precodeimport matplotlib as mpl mpl.useTkAgg import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.ion fig  plt.figurefigsize  [2, 8] fig.setsizeinches[8,8], forward  True fig.canvas.draw print fig.getsizeinches codepre  pa call to codefig.getsizeinchescode gives code[ 8, 7.475]code.  It is a bit annoying that I get code7.475code instead of code8code, but I can deal with that.  Next, when I run the following codep  precodeimport matplotlib as mpl mpl.useTkAgg import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.ion fig  plt.figurefigsize  [8, 8] fig.setsizeinches[2,8], forward  True fig.canvas.draw print fig.getsizeinches codepre  pthen a call to codefig.getsizeinchescode gives code[ 6, 7.475]code.  A reduction to code6code is a far cry from code2code.  Note that interactive mode must be on.  If I turn interactive mode off codeplt.ioffcode the TkAgg backend gives code[8, 8]code and code[2, 8]code, but the shape of the figure windows still look more like code[8, 7.475]code and code[6, 7.475]code.p  pIf I switch to the Qt4Agg backend, the problem goes away.  Unfortunately I cannot get the Qt4Agg backend to work with Spyder.  I set Qt4Agg as the backend in Preferences  Console  external modules  GUI backend, and restart Spyder.  A call to codempl.getbackendcode returns codeMacOSXcode.  p  pI would like a backend that works with Spyder, allows me to force the figure window to be on top of all other windows see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions20025077howdoidisplayamatplotlibfigurewindowontopofallotherwindowsinspydethis posta, and allows me to change the figure window size at will.p  pIn case it matters, I am running matplotlib 1.3.1, and Enthought Canopy Python 2.7.6.p  pUPDATE I got the Qt4Agg backend to work with Spyder.

What I need is a way for this instance to get the public DNS instance of a second ec2 instance.p  pThe idea is that I will have 50 instances running, one or two of which will be a spot instance that is constantly running. All of the other worker instances need to know the spot, or master, instances public DNS name to connect to it within my application. How can I do thisp  pOn another note, is there a way I can create a backup of my spot master instance In case it fails, I would like to have another spot instance that immediately takes its place, but my worker ec2 instances would have to update their information about the spot instances public dns address.p

Negative 70479 pIm working on a project that requires the screen to be blanked out when the device is traveling above a given speed and reenabled when the device slows below a specified speed.  The action of blanking out the screen will need to be effective for all Activities in the application.  When the device is in safety mode traveling above the specified speed, we will need to display specific information on the screen so an activity would work best.  Additionally the process of blanking out the screen can not be controlled or overridden by the operator.p  pCurrently Im trying to showhide the safety mode activity from the Application layer of the android app.  Showing the safety mode activity from the Application layer isnt a problem, however removing the activity and returning to the parent activity is a problem.p  pAny thoughts or direction on this would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 70479 pI have a Rails app which is part of a larger web site. Id like to have a single 404 error page thats used consistently across the site. Currently I have a static page thats part of the landing site, which for historical reasons is served from the codepubliccode section of the Rails appp  precodepubliclanding404.html codepre  pNow Id like my Rails app to serve that page in case of a 404 error. The approach Ive tried is adapted from a hrefhttpeasyactiverecord.comblog20140819redirectingtocustom404and500pagesinrails relnofollowthis blog postap  precodeconfigapplication.rb   config.exceptionsapp  self.routes  configroutes.rb   match 404, to redirectlanding404, via all codepre  pThis appears to work, in that a 404 error will deliver the codelanding404.htmlcode page to the user agent that made the request. However, it delivers the page with status 200, because the server successfully redirected to the static page. So, not web standards compliant and not very RESTful.p  pMy question is can I serve the static page but with a 404 response code Or is there a better way to DRY up my error page configp

When a virtual method is invoked vmi.OnBefore is fired. This is simplified representation of my ideap  pCallVirtualMethodmethod1  OnBeforefires1  CreateThreadandInvokeAgain  OnBeforefires2  DoInvoke  true i.e. directly execute the methodp  pExplanationp  ol lipInitially SomeFlag has a value of PostponeExecution.pli lipThe first call to ttc.method1 will trigger OnBefore event OnBeforefires1. The method will not execute, because SomeFlag is PostponeExecution. Therefore a thread will be created which will set SomeFlag to DirectExecute and will invoke the same method again, but within the threads context.pli lipThen OnBefore fires again because Instance is the proxified object     i.e. the method is the hooked method. This time SomeFlag is     DirectExecute and the method will be invoked.pli ol  pI use proxified object Instance var when invoking the method, because I want Self to point to it. This way if method1 calls other virtual method of the same class the later will also be automatically executed in a thread.p  pFor this to happen I need to store the flag somewhere i.e. indicate OnBefores second call what to do.  My question is howwhere to store SomeFlag so its accessible during the two calls of OnBefore The solution should be crossplatform. Suggestionsother solutions are also welcome.p  pI imagine it can be done with VMT patching a hrefhttphallvards.blogspot.com200705hack17virtualclassvariablesparti.html relnofollowlink1a, a hrefhttpwww.deltics.co.nzblogposts307 relnofollowlink2a, a hrefhttpsynopse.infoforumviewtopic.phpid336 relnofollowlink3a, but VirtualProtect is a Windows only function so crossplatform requirement would be violated.p  pAny idea is highly appreciated. p  pstrongWhats this all aboutstrongp  pImagine you can have this kind of class in Delphip  precodeTBusinessLogic  class   public      Invokes asynchronously     [InvokeTypeAsync]     procedure QueryDataBase       Invokes asynchronously and automatically return asocciated ITask via OnBefore event     [InvokeTypeAwait]     function DownloadFileAUrl string ITask       This method touches GUI i.e. synchonized     [InvokeTypeVclSend]     procedure UpdateProgressBarAValue integer       Update GUI via TThread.Queue     [InvokeTypeVclPost]     procedure AddTreeviewItemAText string  end  ...  procedure TBusinessLogic.QueryDataBase begin    QueryDataBase is executed ASYNC QueryDataBase is tagged as Async    Do heavy DB Query here     Updating GUI is easy, because AddTreeviewItem is tagged as VclPost   for SQLRec in SQLRecords do     AddTreeviewItemSQLRec.FieldByName[CustomerName].asString end codepre  pThis approach really simplifies threading and synchronization. No more ducktyping TThread.Synchronize, TThread.Queue etc.  You just focus on the business logic and call appropriate methods  OnBefore event does the dirty job for you. Very close to Await methods in C.p  pThis is the main idea p  pstrongUPDATEstrong emI reedited the entire question to make it more clear.emp

Unfortunately, there are also no samples available by IBM.p  pReceiving files pose the same problem, and I have not been able to find any classes that could help me there.p  pThis is the code that I am currently using to upload filesp  precodestring resources0  tiffFileContent string resources1  imagetiff string resources2  DmyImageFile.tif  CreateItemRequest createRequest  new CreateItemRequest      AuthenticationData  data,     Item  new CreateItemRequestItem              ItemXML  new ItemXML                      MYITEMTYPE  new MYITEMTYPE                              ArchiveId  4719,                 ICMBASE  new ICMBASE[]                      new ICMBASE                         resourceObject  new LobObjectType                                                      label  new LobObjectTypeLabel                                                              name resources0                             ,                             MIMEType  resources1,                             originalFileName  resources2                         ,                                                            ,     ,     mtomRef  new MTOMAttachment[]  new MTOMAttachment          ID  resources0,         MimeType  resources1,         Value  System.IO.File.ReadAllBytesresources2,   Error on large files     ,   var createReply  service.CreateItemcreateRequest codepre

Negative 70479 pIve been searching the internet to get some information about how i can be able to detect and show what a url is about.  Facebook has a good example of what i actually want to achieve  If you create a update on facebook and paste in a URL, facebook will detect some information about it and show a box with some text and often the right picture.  for instance, take a hrefhttpwww.ebay.comitmMensMonkStrapLoafersSuedeLinedMetalBuckleSlipCasualDressShoesNew311170422772 relnofollowhttpwww.ebay.comitmMensMonkStrapLoafersSuedeLinedMetalBuckleSlipCasualDressShoesNew311170422772a . then it shows the image of the shoe and headline. p  pIve found other services which does this with image services and youtube, but what i need is about getting information of products most of the time, so often urls from shops. So the user pastes in a url, and i can detect what that link is about. p  pany ideer how this can be done   Is it backend code, like c or javascript  p  pHopefully some of you can point me in the right direction. Thanks in advancep

Negative 70479 pI would like to be able to perform something similar to a codeWebDriverWaitcode, i.e p  precodeWebDriverWaitdriver, 60.until     expectedconditions.texttobepresentinelementBy.XPATH, tr[5]td[11]div, 1.000000  codepre  p...for a regular expression, where it waits for an allotted amount of time before failing.  I am aware I could do something, such as...p  precodeassert re.searchr[0,1]1.[09]6, driver.findelementbyxpathtr[5]td[11]div.text codepre  p...or I could replace strongsearchstrong with strongmatchstrong in the above example.  The problem with this method is itll fail if the object.. 1 hasnt loaded yet or.. 2 is still in the process of changing to whats expected. I could do something like...p  precodefor x in range 1,60     try         assert re.searchr[0,1]1.[09]6, driver.findelementbyxpathtr[5]td[11]div.text     except AssertionError         if x lt 60             time.sleep1         else             raise AssertionError codepre  p...where it checks every second for 60 seconds to see if the strongassertstrong statement has evaluated to true.  This could fit into a module or class.  What Im wondering is if there is a more elegant solution, in Python for the Selenium WebDriver, to handling this that Im unaware of.p

Negative 70479 pstrongObjectivestrongp  pI am attempting to create an animated approximation of human writing, using a UIBezierPath generated from a glyph. I understand and I have read the many UIBezierPath questions which sound similar to mine but are not the same. My goal is to create an animation that approximates the look of a human performing the writing of characters and letters. p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIve created a playground that I am using to better understand paths for use in animating glyphs as if they were drawn by hand. p  pA couple of concepts in the Apple CAShapeLayer strokeStart and strokeEnd really dont seem to operate as expected when animated. I think that generally people tend to think of a stroke as if done with a writing instrument basically a straight or curved line. We consider the stroke and fill together to be a line as our writing instruments do not distinguish between stroke and fill. p  pBut when animated, the outline of a path is constructed by line segments fill is treated separately and it is unclear how to animate the position of the fill. What I want to achieve is a natural human written linecurve that shows the start and end of a stroke together with the portion of the fill being added as the animation moves from start to finish. Initially this appears simple but I think it may require animating the fill position unsure of how to do this, the stroke startend not sure if this required given the unexpected caveats with how the animation performs noted above, and making use of subpaths how to reconstruct from a known path.p  pemApproach 1emp  pSo, Ive considered the idea of a Path CGPathUIBezierPath. Each path actually contains all of the subpaths required to construct a glyph so perhaps recursing those subpaths and using a CAKeyframeAnimation  CABasicAnimations and an animation group showing the partially constructed subpaths would be a good approach although the fill position and stroke of each subpath would still need to be animated from start to end. p  pThis approach leads to the refined question p  pemHow to access and create UIBezierPathCGPath subpaths if one has a complete UIBezierPathCGPathemp  pHow to animate the fill and stroke as if drawn with a writing instrument using the pathsubpath information seemingly this implies one would need to animate the strokeStartstrokeEnd, position, and path properties of a CALayer at the same time  p  pNB p  pAs one can observe in the code, I do have the finished paths obtained from glyphs. I can see that the path description gives me pathlike information. How would one take that information and recast it as an array of delsub pathsdel humanwritable strokes p  pThe idea here would be to convert the point information into a new data type of humanlike strokes. This implies a requirement for an algorithm to identify the start, slope, endpoint and boundary of each fill p  pstrongHintsstrong p  pIve noted in Pleco an iOS app that successfully implements a similar algorithm, that each stroke is composed of a closed path that describes the humanwritable stroke. UIBezierPath has a closed path based on continuous connected fills. An algorithm is needed to refine overlapping fills to create distinct closed paths for each a hrefhttpwww.clearchinese.comchinesewritingstrokes.htmstroketypea. p  pErica Sadun has a set of a hrefhttpsgithub.comericaiOSDrawingtreemasterC05path utilitiesa available on github. I havent fully explored these files but they might prove useful in determining discrete strokes.p  pUIBezierPath structure seems based on the notion of a contiguous line segmentscurve. There are confluence points appearing at the intersections of fills, which represent directional path change. Could one calculate the strokefill angle of a curveline segment and search other curveslines for a corresponding confluence point i.e. connect a line segment across the gap of intersecting fills to produce two separate paths  assuming one picked up the points and recreated the path with a new line segmentcurvep  pIntrospectively Is there a simpler method Am I missing a critical API, a book or a better approach to this problemp  pSome alternative methods not useful  requires loading gifs or flash for producing the desired outcomep  pa hrefhttppic.zdic.netkaijtbhswf1a6211.swfGood Example using Flasha with a presentation layer showing progression of the written stroke.

But this line of thought seems a bit far afield, after all, the path information I want is stored in the glyphs that Ive extracted from fontsstrings provided. p  pemApproach 2emp  pI am considering the use of a a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiComputerfontStrokebasedfontformatsstrokebaseda font rather than an a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiComputerfontOutlinefontsoutlinebaseda font to obtain the correct path information i.e. one where fill is represented as a path. If successful, this approach would be cleaner than approximating the strokes, stroketype, intersections, and stroke order. Ive already submitted a radar to Apple suggesting that strokebased fonts be added to iOS 20426819. Notwithstanding this effort, I still have not given up on forming an algorithm that resolves partialstrokes, full strokes, intersections, and confluence points from the linesegments and curves found on the bezier path. p  pstrongUpdated Thoughts Based On DiscussionAnswersstrongp  pThe following additional information is provided based on any ongoing conversations and answers below.p  pStroke order is important and most languages Chinese in this case have clearly defined a hrefhttpwww.clearchinese.comchinesewritingstrokes.htmstroke typesa and a hrefhttpwww.clearchinese.comchinesewritingstrokeorder.htmstroke order rulesa that appear to provide a mechanism to determine type and order based on the point information provided with each CGPathElement.p  pCGPathApply and CGPathApplierFunction appear promising as a means to enumerate the subpaths saved to an array and apply the fill animationp  pA mask may be applied to the layer to reveal a portion of the sublayer I have not used this property before but it appears that if I could move a masked layer over the subpaths that might assist in animating the fillp  pThere are a large number of points defined for each path. As if the BezierPath is defined using the outline of the glyph only. This fact makes understanding the start, end, and union of crossing fills an important factor to disambiguate specific fills. p  pAdditional a hrefhttpwww.wenlin.comcdlexternal librariesa are available that may allow one to better resolve stroke behavior. Other technology like the a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiSaffronTypeSystemStylizedstrokefontsSaffron Type Systema or one of its derivatives may be applicable to this problem domain.p  pA basic issue with the simplest solution of just animating the stroke is that the available iOS fonts are outline fonts rather than strokebased fonts. Some commercial manufacturers do produce strokebased fonts. Please feel free to use the a hrefhttpsgithub.commingsaiglyphsplaygroundlink to the playground filea if you have one of these for testing.p  pI think this is a common problem and I will continue to update the post as I move toward a solution. Please let me know in the comments if further information is required or if I might be missing some of the necessary concepts.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfJuNN.png altmaskp  pstrongPossible Solutionstrongp  pI am always in search of the simplest possible solution. The issue originates from the structure of the fonts being outline fonts rather than strokebased. I found a sample of a strokebased font to test and used that to evaluate a emproof of conceptem a hrefhttpgoogledrive.comhost0B8D3kbf8rViMY1FnSF8tWmlySGssee videoa. I am now in search of an extended single stroke font which includes Chinese characters to further evaluate. A less simple solution might be to find a way to create a stroke that follows the fill and then use simple 2D geometry to evaluate which stroke to animate first For example Chinese rules are very clear on stroke order.p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.commingsaiglyphsplaygroundLink to Playground on Githubap  ul liTo use the XPCShowView function  Open the File Navigator and File Utilities Inspectorli liClick the playground file and in the FUI choose Run in Simulatorli liTo access the Assistant Editor Goto menu View   Assistant Editorli liTo see resourcessources rightclick playground file in Finder and Show Package Contentsli liIf Playground is blank on opening, copy the file to the desktop and reopen bugli ul  pstrongPlayground Codestrongp  precodeimport CoreText import Foundation import UIKit import QuartzCore import XCPlayground  research layers var lCALayer  nil var txtCATextLayer  nil var rCAReplicatorLayer  nil var tileCATiledLayer  nil var transCATransformLayer  nil var bCAAnimationnil    Setup playground to run in full simulator 0Select Playground File alt0Choose option Run in Full Simulator  approach 2 using a custom stroke font requires special font without an outline whose path is the actual fill var customFontPath  NSBundle.mainBundle.pathForResourcecwTeXFangSongzhonly, ofType ttf    Within the playground folder create Resources folder to hold fonts.

Negative 70479 pI need to extend an existing MFC app with a UI that will end up very cluttered unless I use a tab control. However, the nature of the UI is that there are some controls that are global, and only some that can be localised to a particular tab.p  pThe standard use of tab controls codeCPropertySheet  CPropertyPagecode more or less expects there only to be codeCPropertyPagecode instances tabs visible on the codeCPropertySheetcode object, and nothing else. There is a a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryet63ay6a28vvs.8029.aspx relnofollowMicrosoft Example Projecta that shows a single additional window painted outside the area occupied by the tab control... but its not immediately clear how it is createddrawnhandled, and it is only one single additional window that generates few events I guess it is painted, so there must be a WMPAINT event handler lurking somewhere.p  pIs it possible to lay out a bunch of controls with the MS Dialog Editor, including a tab control, and create the codeCPropertySheetcode using that template, hook up event handlers in a nice way, etc... or some equivalent way of getting the MFC framework to do as much of the creating, drawing and event handling as possible when it comes to a situation like thisp

Negative 70479 pI have an Java agent synchronizing Notes documents with rows in a MS SQL table. New documents are inserted and changed dokuments are updated, but I have not found a good way to handle deleted documents. I use JDBC.

Negative 70479 pfor the first I need to update the schema of one of my apps, so I created a new RealmModel. This model is isolated from the other tables, so there are no modifications on the old schema, just a new table. The problem is that even if I try to do the migration an exception is thrown telling me that xxModel class is missing from the schema for this realm. The xxModel is not the new one, but an older one. What am I missing  What is the procedure when you add a new table in realm schema The new model contains just some strings and integers btw.p  pThank you.p

Negative 70479 pIm very new to Python but Im trying to produce a 2D Gaussian fit for some data. Specifically, stellar fluxes linked to certain positions in a coordinate systemgrid. However not all of the positions in my grid have corresponding flux values. I dont really want to set these values to zero in case it biases my fit, but I cant seem to set them to codenancode and still get my Gaussian fit to work.

Negative 70479 pThis is runnable java code. If you want to test it, copy the two code excerpts below. compile and run Triangleframe.java p  pI am drawing two trianglesmay be I add more later on a JPanel. I click on one of the triangles and drag it. This used to work sort of before I decided to honor the clip area as recommended by Oracle in this lesson a hrefhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialuiswingpainting relnofollowCustom paintingap  pThe reason I switched from coderepaintcode to coderepaintx,y,with,heightcode was that when I tried to drag one of the triangles, it was very sluggish to repaint, and it was not very good at following the mousepointer eitherlag. I reasoneded that staying within bounds and repainting only the portion of the screen I am using would fix the problem. It did fix the lag, but now the boundingbox I am repainting does not seem to move as long as the mouse button is pressed. The triangle is only moving withing the bounding box. Not until I release the mousebutton that isat which point a new triangle is created. Preferrably I should only be redrawing only the triangle and not the bounding box, but for convenience sake I try to tackle this problem first. It is desireable that the triangles are able to overlap.p  psee comments in code for more in depth explanation.p  pre classlangjava prettyprintoverridecodeimport java.awt.Color import java.awt.Graphics import java.awt.Point import java.awt.Polygon import java.awt.Rectangle  import java.awt.event.MouseEvent import java.awt.event.MouseListener import java.awt.event.MouseMotionListener import javax.swing.JPanel    This is a stripped down version of the code which shows        the problem. Just create an instance of the class by running    TriangleFrame.java. Then try to drag either triangle with      the mouse.                                                     public class TrianglePanel extends JPanel implements MouseListener,     MouseMotionListener       Triangle triangle1  null     Triangle triangle2  null     Rectangle boundingBox  null      int lastXPos  0     int lastYPos  0     boolean draggable  false      public TrianglePanel           triangle1  new Trianglenew Point100, 10, new Point50, 100,                 new Point150, 100         triangle2  new Trianglenew Point250, 10, new Point150, 100,                 new Point350, 100         lastXPos  this.getX         lastYPos  this.getY          addMouseListenerthis         addMouseMotionListenerthis           Override     public void mouseReleasedMouseEvent e           triangle1.createNewTriangle         triangle2.createNewTriangle           Override     public void mousePressedMouseEvent e          draggable  false         if triangle1.getPos.containse.getPoint                  triangle2.getPos.containse.getPoint              draggable  true             lastXPos  e.getX             lastYPos  e.getY                    Override     public void mouseDraggedMouseEvent e          if draggable              isInsidetriangle1, e             isInsidetriangle2, e                    private void isInsideTriangle t, MouseEvent e           if t.getPos.containse.getPoint             updatePost, e                 Next I try to do the right thing by only repainting the            portion of the panel that I use.                                Well, almost. To make it as simple as possible for now          I use a boundingbox rectangle and repaint within those          bounds.

Negative 70479 pI just upgraded an old 2011 MacBook Air from Snow Leopard to Yosemite.  My old MacVim didnt work, and the most recent precompiled version at SourceForge didnt work, so I compiled it myself, with no codeconfigurecode additions.p  pI noticed that now when I open a gvim window, I see it expand from a central point, spreading out until it reaches its appropriate size.  Not all windows do that for example, when I open a new Terminal window, it just appears without any expanding effect.  I have genie effect turned off in the Dock, by the way.p  pIs the expanding window effect a feature in vim that I can turn offperhaps with a compiletime optionp  pOr is the expanding window effect just a consequence of Yosemites general slowness on this machine  Maybe MacVim always did this, but I didnt notice in SnowLeopard, because it happened too quickly.  Maybe my Yosemite Terminal windows are doing this too, but the windowcreation code in Terminal is more optimized than MacVims which wouldnt be surprising given that Terminal, unlike Vim, has to support only a single OS.p  pId be happy to migrate this to AskDifferent.SE if thats appropriate.  Doesnt seem like the best place for Vim questions, though.  This is a programming question if its about how vim is coded and how to compile it, but Im not sure yet what kind of answer the question needs.p

Negative 70479 pI have a python program. It takes some text from a text file A as an input, do some text annotation and stores the annotated text as an output in another file B.

Specifically, my php code does thisp  pTakes text from a HTML textarea.p  pSaves the text into file A.p  pRuns the python program.p  pLoad the output from file B and show the annotated text in the HTML textarea.p  pNow, to do the text annotation, python program needs to load a model from another big file C. I would say, loading time is 10 sec and annotating takes 2 sec. Each time, I have a new text in the HTML textarea, I need 12 sec to show the output. I want to minimize the overall time.p  pI was thinking, if I could communicate from PHP with an already running python program, I could actually save 10 sec.

Negative 70479 pI would like to generate Rules DSL from the helper module. I have custom blog helper and i would like it to generate RSS feeds automatically so I dont have to specify any compile and routing rules in the codeRulescode file as long as specific metadata is present.p  pSo lets say I have my blog in codenews.erbcode and codenews.mdcode directory. Erb file has blog configuration in its metadata section number of articles to show, ordering etc.. In preprocessing I have codecreateblogcode function which generates codepageNcode depending on the metadata I have in codenews.erbcode. If this metadata includes coderss truecode section I would like the codecreateblogcode function to also register 2 aditional rules if those are not previously defined and 1 aditional file codefeedsnews.xmlcodep  precodecompile feeds.  do   filter erb end  route feeds. do     item.identifier.chop  .xml end codepre  pI can generate the file all right, but in order to keep the site modularized I want to create those above rules in the codecreateblogcode itself. This allows me to later, if I want to remove the blog, just delete the files without manually changing codeRulescode file.p
