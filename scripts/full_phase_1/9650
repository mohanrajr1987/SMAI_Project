Positive 9650 pI have a Windows Service project which wrote by VS2010, C, Target .NET Framework 4.0. I used to debug it in VS2010 Administrator mode without any problem.p  pAnd then, I install VS2015 Community on yesterday. When I want to debug F5 my project in VS2010, it raise an codeAccessViolationExceptioncode. If I choose run without debug CtrlF5, my project still working without any exception.p  pI tried to set some breakpoints in codemaincode, constructor, Service Entrypoints, but the exception still raised before any breakpoints be hit. In other words, I think this exception is not caused by my project, it should be a bug of VS.p  pTherefore, I search some article about codeVS AccessViolationExceptioncode, and I found that my situation is similar to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19578568vs20122013accessviolationexceptionthis SO articlea and tried the solution provided by a hrefhttpsconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails819552visualstudiodebuggerthrowsaccessviolationexception relnofollowMicrosoft Connecta Both of 4.5.2 framework and devpack are installed. However, its still not work.p  pAny suggestion, pleasep

Positive 9650 pSimple question with an asofyet unfound answer.  We have a WPF DataGrid on our window which supports multiselect.  Say it has ten items in it and you have items six through ten selected.  If you tab away from the control, when the control gets focus again, the first item is focused but not selected.  The selection still remains on items six through ten. This is made worse for us because we hide the focus rectangle, instead relying on the selection highlight, which is what the user would expect to happen.p  pIve tried responding to the IsKeyboardFocusWithinChanged event as shown here, including with and without the dispatcher, figuring maybe something else was changing it after the fact, but still no avail.p  precodeprivate void TestDataGridIsKeyboardFocusWithinChangedobject sender, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e      ifboole.NewValue         return      Dispatcher.Invokenew Action gt               var firstSelectedItem  VariableValuesDataGrid.SelectedItem          iffirstSelectedItem  null             VariableValuesDataGrid.CurrentItem  firstSelectedItem     , DispatcherPriority.Background  codepre  pAny idea how to get around thisp

I also tried making the main Wix project target 4.0 directly instead of 3.5, but then my setup dialogs will just fail to show.p

Positive 9650 pI just recently encountered this issue myself, and searching for this issue has turned up no fruits yet...p  pSo lets say I have four checkboxes, as an example, and I want to do certain things based on which of them are checked at any time...p  precodeif CB1.Checked      Do things here if only checkbox 1 is checked.  else if CB2.Checked      Do things here if only checkbox 2 is checked.  else if CB3.Checked      Do things here if only checkbox 3 is checked.  else if CB4.Checked      Do things here if only checkbox 4 is checked.  codepre  pIm sure most people will tend to use something like the example code snippet above, or a variation of it. It looks simple, right But what if... you arent just checking for only one checkbox alonep  precodeif CB1.Checked ampamp CB2.Checked      Do things here if only checkbox 1 amp 2 is checked.  else if CB2.Checked ampamp CB3.Checked      Do things here if only checkbox 2 amp 3 is checked.  else if CB3.Checked ampamp CB1.Checked      Do things here if only checkbox 3 amp 1 is checked.  else if CB4.Checked ampamp CB1.Checked      Do things here if only checkbox 4 amp 1 is checked.  else if CB4.Checked ampamp CB2.Checked      Do things here if only checkbox 4 amp 2 is checked.  else if CB4.Checked ampamp CB3.Checked      Do things here if only checkbox 4 amp 3 is checked.  codepre  pAs can be seen... the number of ifelse statements have increased... And it will, if you wanted to compare perhaps even more checkboxes than 4, or for more checkboxes out of 4... And that could complicate things, with likely most programmers being unable to avoid it.p  pI should also mention that I know how many checkboxes are checked at a given time, thanks to this codep  precodeprivate int GetNumberOfCheckboxesChecked      int NumberofCheckBoxesChecked  0     foreach Control c in groupBox1.Controls              if c is CheckBox ampamp CheckBoxc.Checked             NumberofCheckBoxesChecked           return NumberofCheckBoxesChecked  codepre  pThey will also need to check one of the checkboxes at all times, as each checkboxs checkchanged event calls this codep  precodeprivate void OneAtLeastobject originalSender      CheckBox tempCB  CheckBoxoriginalSender     if CB1.Checked ampamp CB2.Checked ampamp CB3.Checked ampamp CB4.Checked              tempCB.Checked  true         MessageBox.ShowYou must select at least one option, Invalid Operation, MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Error       codepre  pSo, strongmy question is...strong is there a better or more efficient, or can reduce the lines of code way to do things according to which checkboxcheckboxes isare checked Or are we really stuck to this method or variations of this methodp  pstrongDo note that for this example, whatever you would be doing according to which checkboxes are checked... cant simply be added on or appended.strongp  pIt should also be noted that the switchcase method will be more or less the same as this method... so it would most likely not make a difference. It has also been a hrefhttpcodereview.stackexchange.comquestions44959howcanimakethreeifelsestatementsmoreefficientconcluded elsewhere that ifstatements are more efficient that switchcase.ap

Positive 9650 pI am trying to write a piece of software that would preferably be database agnostic, i.e., a user should be able to give any connection string, and things should just work. p  pI already figured out how to create a database connection based on the codeProviderNamecode using codeDbProviderFactoriescode, and how to create a command using codeDbConnection.CreateCommandcode. p  pOne problem that I havent been able to solve is how to use parameters in a query For example, an ODBC connection expects a question mark codeselect  from table where fieldcode, but other types of connection expect a name codeselect  from table where fieldvaluecode. p  pI could do something like this pseudo codep  precodeif dbConnection is OdbcConnection      sql  ... else if dbConnection is OracleConnection      sql  ... else ... codepre  pBut obviously that is not an ideal situation.p  pIs there a way to get some information about the required parameter syntax for a given connection I was thinking about codeDbConnection.QualifyParameterNamenamecode which would return a codecode in case of an codeOdbcConnectioncode, and codenamecode or some other syntax I havent thought about otherwise.p  pAny ideasp

Continuing my example, Im doing thisp  precodeUserEntities userEntities  new UserEntitites User user  new User user.UserType  new UserType user.UserType.EntityKey  adminEntityKey userEntities.AddToUseruser codepre  p...and this gives me the following errorp  blockquote   pSystem.InvalidOperationException  The object cannot be added to the ObjectStateManager because it already has an EntityKey.

Negative 9650 pHow can breakpoints be enabled or disabled at runtime  Im writing a test workbench application that can run other .net code for the purposes of debugging plugins.  The workbench app itself is not debuggable DebuggableNonUserCodeAttribute but the user code that it calls should be.  But then, under certain circumstances at runtime, the user code breakpoints should not be honored.p  pI can imagine various ways of achieving this, many may not be possiblep  p1 Attach and detach the debugger programmaticallybr 2 Enable and disable all breakpoints programmatically preferably localized to an assembly or classbr 3 Dynamically decorate and undecorate methods with the DebuggableNonUserCodeAttribute at runtime.br 4 Somehow mark an entire code branch of a thread beyond a chosen stackframe as nonbreakpointable for the debugger.  DebuggableNonUserCodeAttribute only seems to work within a method or class, but does not affect downstream code debuggability.p  pEDIT To clarify during runtime, the same piece of end user code will be run multiple times by the hosting executable, some where breakpoints should be honored and other times when they shouldnt be.  It would be inappropriate to require that the user modify their code for this feature or that they be required to set conditional breakpoints.p

Negative 9650 pI am writing an app in which I have mutiple screens which I want to adhere to a certain theme. For example all screens should have the same background, all screens should have a bar on the top with the same set of actions not necessarily dependent on the activity currently being show and all screens should share the same fonts. Is there a way in android to create a parent layout which all other layouts extend and therefore if I need to change some elements say the background color I wont have to do it on each individual screen but rather only in the parent screen.

Negative 9650 pI am struggling with detecting whether an entity in EF4 has changes that need saving.p  pAfter a few years away from .NET rusty is definitely the word Id use to describe where I am right now.  I am trying to learn to use EF4 and WPF while reacquainting myself with .NET.  Ive followed a number of tutorials on Drag amp Drop Databinding with the Entity Framework and WPF and built an app with a few Windows that is getting my knowledge up little by little.p  pI am using the simplest part of my Model for my training exercises, The model has entities Network and Laboratory, there is a manytomany link between Networks and Labs, namely NetworkLabs, the relationship is not particularly important right now as I am still at the very basics.p  pI have a window that displays a list of Networks in a listbox, with a DataGrid next to it showing the Laboratories in the Network.  I was able to do that fairly easily following the tutorials and I ended up with code likep  precodePublic Class NetworkListWindow  Private Function GetNetworksQueryentities As UKNEQASEntities As ObjectQueryOf Network      Dim networksQuery As ObjectQueryOf Network  entities.Networks      Update the query to include NetworkLabs data in Networks.     networksQuery  networksQuery.IncludeNetworkLabs      Returns an ObjectQuery     Return networksQuery  End Function  Private Sub WindowLoadedsender As System.Object, e As System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs Handles MyBase.Loaded      Dim entities As UKNEQASEntities  New UKNEQASEntities      Load data into Networks.

That second window is where I am hitting problems, on that window I dragged the network entity over from the Data Sources window to create a details screen a grid with labels and textboxes in the rows and columns.  I ended up with code likep  precodePublic Class NetworkWindow  Private mid As Integer Private mdb As New UKNEQASEntities  Public Sub Newid As Integer       This call is required by the designer.     InitializeComponent       Add any initialization after the InitializeComponent call.     mid  id  End Sub  Private Function GetNetworkQuery As ObjectQueryOf Network      Dim networkQuery As ObjectQueryOf Network  mdb.Networks      Update the query to include only the Network we are editing     networkQuery  networkQuery.WhereFunctionnet net.Id  mid      Update the query to include NetworkLabs data in Networks.     networkQuery  networkQuery.IncludeNetworkLabs      Returns an ObjectQuery     Return networkQuery  End Function  Private Sub WindowLoadedsender As System.Object, e As System.Windows.RoutedEventArgs Handles MyBase.Loaded       Load data into Networks.

My problem comes when catering for when the user edits the data and closes the window, I want to detect whether the current network needs saving back to the database so I can prompt the user but I dont know how to get hold of the network to check.p  pI suspect it is something to do with code likep  precode     Dim networkViewSource As CollectionViewSource  CTypeMe.FindResourceUKNEQASEntitiesNetworksViewSource, CollectionViewSource      Dim entry As ObjectStateEntry  mdb.ObjectStateManager.GetObjectStateEntry.... codepre  pbut I dont know how to get the network to pass to GetObjectStateEntry.p  pOn my previous list screen I was able to get the selected network by getting the SelectedItem from the listbox but I cant find anything that would help me on my single entry window.p  pAm I going about this the right way  For the single entry edit screen I am still using CollectionViewSource like I did for the list screen, is that the best way or is there something for single entitiesp  pI have been looking for lots of tutorials and the majority I find are all about displaying the data for editing in DataGrids which is not what I am looking for.  I am struggling to find any help on making screens for editing single entities so dont know how to pick up a reference to the entity the user is editing.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated as I am a novice at this EF and XAML lark.p

Negative 9650 pIm working in phpMyAdmin 3.3.9 with mySQL 5.5.8. I have a database with myISAM tables so I had to write a trigger to check referential integrity between two table fields. I have a table codeprojectkeycode with the primary key listed as the codeprocess IDcode field. The second table is codehvicode and it also contains the codeprocess IDcode field. The codeprocess IDcodes in the codehvicode table must also be in the codeprojectkeycode table. So I wrote a trigger to display an error if this is not the case, which looks like thisp  precodecreate trigger t1 before insert    on hvi for each row begin declare dummy int . . . if new.process id not inselect process id from projectkey then  select Process ID not in projectkey into dummy from hvi where KEY new.KEY end if end codepre  pIf the process ID is not null this works just fine. When it catches a codeprocess IDcode that is trying to be imported into codehvicode that isnt already in the codeprojectkeycode table is displays the error Unknown column Process ID not in projectkey in field list like its coded to do.p  pThe problem comes in when I do not have a codeprocess IDcode for a row of data which is a common occurrence. My record of data will have a blank space, so I want the trigger to convert that blank space to a null value and then accept this null value. I tried to code it like this, but it didnt workp  precodecreate trigger nullt1 before insert    on hvi for each row begin declare dummy int if new.Process ID    then set new.Process ID  null end if . . . if new.process id not inselect process id from projectkey or null then  select Process ID not in projectkey into dummy from hvi where KEY new.KEY end if end codepre  pI was taking a shot in the dark with the allowing the null part, because Ive never tried anything like that before Ive done the converting blank spaces to null values before and that works. This trigger in its entirety obviously didnt work though becasue when I tried to import a row with the blank space it still gives me my Unknown column Process ID not in projectkey in field list error. p  pDoes anyone know how I can make this workp

Negative 9650 pI am working on a project of an electronic library for Arabic books. A program that allows the user to import his books into the systems library and perform searching against his library. The system is delivered to the user with a basic library set of books that the  user ca update later.p  pTo handle the searching problems, i thought for the system to have an initial table in the DB for the basic searching keywords. Every search keyword points to its locations in the books in the library.p  pThe problem appears when in the user imports a new book into the library. There are two step. The first search the keywords that are already into the system against the new book to find if any of them appear in the book and add there location into the system. The second, which the main stumbling block, is to identify NEW search keywords in the new book.p  pThe idea that i have, which i think is pretty bad and naive, is to break the new book into tokens and then search each token against all the book previously found in the library.p  pso to sumup, if any help tools, libraries or DB options or idea to solve the second problem or another idea for the whole system, i appreciate. really tried reading and searching a lot of a solution, but invain.p  pThanks a lot,p

Assuming that a UTF16 is 2 bytes, this would give me a conservative upperbound for sure, which is a good start.p  pFor the mutable array, I could assume that the storage is length raised to next power of 2 times sizeofvoid.p  pIs there a better way to calculate the size though Is there a function to get the bytes allocated for an object derived from CFTypep  pFailing that, I plan on writing a CFAllocator that proxies all calls to the real CFAllocator that I am using, but records the deltas of the allocations.p  p[1] a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCoreFoundationConceptualCFStringsArticlesStringStorage.htmlapplerefdocuid20001179CJBEJBHH relnofollowhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCoreFoundationConceptualCFStringsArticlesStringStorage.htmlapplerefdocuid20001179CJBEJBHHap

Negative 9650 pSorry if Im not wording this too well, but let me try to explain what Im doing. I have a main object of class A, that has multiple objects of classes B, C, D and E. p  psuch thatp  precodeClass ObjectA       ObjectB[] myObjectBs      ObjectC[] myObjectCs      ObjectD[] myObjectDs      ObjectE[] myObjectEs   codepre  pwhere AB mapping is 1 to many, for B, C, D and E. That is, all B,C,D,E objects are associated with only one object A.p  pIm storing the data for all these objects in a database, with Table A holding all the data for the instances of Class A, etc.p  pNow, when getting the data for this at run time on the fly, Im running 5 different queries for each object.p  pvery simplified psuedocodep  precodeobjectAsqlselect  from tableA where idid objectA.setObjectBssqlselect  from tableB where aidid objectA.setObjectCssqlselect  from tableC where aidid objectA.setObjectDssqlselect  from tableD where aidid objectA.setObjectEssqlselect  from tableE where aidid codepre  pif that makes sense.p  pNow, Im wondering, is this the most efficient way of doing it I feel like there should be a way to get all this info in 1 query, but doing something like select  from a,b,c,d,e where a.id  id and b.aid  id and c.aid  id and d.aid  id and e.aid  id will give a result set with all the columns of A,B,C,D,E for each row, and there will be many many more rows that Id be needing.p  pIf there was only one array of objects like just ObjectBs it could be done with a simple join and then handled by my database framework. If the relationships were Aone....Bmany and Bone....Cmany it could be done with two joins and work. But for Aone....Bmany and Aone....Cmany etc I cant think of a good way to do joins or return this data without having too many rows, as with joins if A has 10 Bs and 10Cs, itll return 100 rows rather than 20. p  pSo, is the way Im currently doing it, with 5 different selects, the most efficient which it seems like its not, or is there a better way of doing itp  pAlso, If  I were to grab a large set of these at once say, 5000 ObjectAs and all the associated Bs, Cs, Ds, and Es, would there be a way to do it without running a ton of consecutive queries one after the other p

I put both model attribute methods into the ParentModel and it works sporadically at best... The sporadic behavior is likely due to the order in which the methods are returned by reflection.

Negative 9650 pPreviously I have set up a Django with MySQL attached for all of my projects.  I am looking into trying something different for this next project though.  What I need for it to do is for the client to be able to store a string, username, and timestamp.  Then for another client to be able to download all the latest of these records after a certain time.  I could do it with Django but it feels like there is too much setup for such a task.

Negative 9650 pWe have existing application settings including secured credential data passwords, names, certificates etc. which we would like shared to multiple applications not written by us running on iOS, rather than requiring the user to re enter the information.

The MDM seems to be the closest so far, however to my knowledge credentials are limited to general certificates, and application section is limited to the app only.

Negative 9650 pI have an app within which I submit data to Facebook, I have the login and everything working perfectly, storing user credentials in the user defaults upon successful login.p  pThe problem I am having is that there seems to be no way of detecting when a user has logged out of either the Facebook app or using Mobile Safari. This means that my app is tied to one and only one user for its lifetime.p  pI do not want to put a Logout button in my app, if I had one then I could easily call the logout method and delete the user credentials meaning a new user could authenticate with my app, but thats not a possibility.p  pDoes anyone know of a way I can check if a user is logged in and if so get their Facebook ID This way I could force authorisation again if either there is no one logged in or the credentials of the logged in user and saved credentials do not match.p  pThanks p
Negative 9650 pI have two questions about codestaticcode  codeconstcode members and codestaticcode classes.p  pOne Why would you declare a class that has all static and const members and not make the class staticp  pI have been studying .net code in reflector as a learning exercise. The class I have been studying that demonstrates this design is the codeFormsAuthenticationcode class. All of its members are marked codestaticcode or codeconstcode yet the class its self is marked codepublic sealedcode The only non static member in the class is a default constructor with no implementation. Why has this class not been marked codepublic static sealedcodep  pMy second question is regarding why the members in the codeFormsAuthenticationcode class are declared as codestaticcode. As I understand it there could be many codeHttpApplicationscode running in the apps codeAppDomaincode and all these codeHttpApplicationscode would share the same codeFormsAuthenticationcode classes static members.p  pTwo Doesnt this cause a bottleneck If so why is it designed like this p

Negative 9650 pI have a Github repository and a private internal repository. Currently, we just add the two repo references n the gitconfig file of the repositoy, both as the remote origin. So, when we push changes, they go to both repos. We started doing this as a redundancy policy.p  pHowever, we started using the pull requests. The main objective behind this is a inexperienced dev forked the main repo, made changes, tested them, pulled them to their repos and then pullrequested them to the main repo. A more experienced developer would review these changes and merge or not into the main repo. However, in a first test, this caused the repos to go out of sync.p  pIs there any way to keep them synced I also would appreciate protips for a better approach or better practices.p

I want multiple balls on the screen and eventually I want the balls to be moving around randomly and if they collide with the character you lose this simple game.p  precodefrom pygame import  import random  class Ballsprite.Sprite     def initself, numballs, balls  []         sprite.Sprite.initself         self.image  image.loadball.png         self.rect  self.image.getrect         self.numballs  numballs         self.balls  balls       def multipleBallsself         for count in rangeself.numballs             self.balls.appenddict             self.balls[count]  x 0, y 0, xmove random.randint1,2, ymoverandom.randint1,2      def ballMoveself         for count in rangeself.numballs             self.balls[count][x]  self.balls[count][x]  self.balls[count][xmove]             self.balls[count][y]  self.balls[count][y]  self.balls[count][ymove]      def ballsOnScreenself         for count in rangeself.numballs             self.screen.blitself.image, self.balls[count][x], self.balls[count][y]       def ballBarrierself         for count in rangeself.numballs             if self.balls[count][x] gt 620                 self.balls[count][xmove]  random.randint2, 0             if self.balls[count][x] lt 10                 self.balls[count][xmove]  random.randint0, 2             if self.balls[count][y] gt 470                 self.balls[count][ymove]  random.randint2, 0             if self.balls[count][y] lt 10                 self.balls[count][ymove]  random.randint0, 2      def manageBallself         self.multipleBalls         self.ballsOnScreen         self.ballMove         self.ballBarrier  class Charactersprite.Sprite     def initself, xy         sprite.Sprite.initself         self.image  image.loadcharacter.png         self.rect  self.image.getrect         self.rect.centerx, self.rect.centery  xy         self.movementspeed  1         self.velocity  0       def downself         self.velocity  self.movementspeed      def upself         self.velocity  self.movementspeed      def characterMoveself, dy         if self.rect.bottom  dy gt 480             self.rect.bottom  480         elif self.rect.top  dy lt 0             self.rect.top  0         else             self.rect.y  dy      def updateself         self.characterMoveself.velocity   class Gameobject     def initself         init         key.setrepeat1, 30         self.screen  display.setmode640, 480         self.clock  time.Clock         display.setcaptionGame         event.setallowed[QUIT, KEYDOWN, KEYUP]         self.background  Surface640, 480         self.background.fill0,0,0         self.screen.blitself.background, 0,0         display.flip         self.sprites  sprite.RenderUpdates         self.character  Character320, 240         self.sprites.addself.character         self.ball  Ball5         self.sprites.addself.ball      def runself         running  True         while running  True             self.clock.tick60             running  self.handleEvents             display.setcaptiongame d fps  self.clock.getfps             for sprite in self.sprites                 sprite.update             self.sprites.clearself.screen, self.background             dirty  self.sprites.drawself.screen             display.updatedirty             self.ball.manageBall      def handleEventsself         for e in event.get             if e.type  QUIT                 return False              elif e.type  KEYDOWN                 if e.key  KESCAPE                     return False                 if e.key  KUP                     self.character.up                 if e.key  KDOWN                     self.character.down          return True    def main     game  Game     game.run main codepre

Negative 9650 pIm developing a Mobile site template using jQuery Mobile with the iScroll plugin. Basically I want to have a static footer and header. In addition to the iScroll.js I also am including the jquery iScroll script by Kazuhiro Osawa to make it work w JQM. In his script you can offset the height of the URL bar in Safari Mobile. The problem is after the page loads Safaris URL bar hides and creates a bunch of padding at the bottom. In the script I can offset this, but this will kill Android UX.  Does anyone have any ideas or a solution for this Ideally, I would like to detect the device window size and perform something like this [device window size  Header Height  Footer Height]  Scrollable window size.

With this input I want to apply user defined substitution rules exchange this string for that string, if we see this string followed by that string perform this translation, etc.p  pThe output is also a formatted DOS ASCII file.p  pMost of the rules are straight forward replace tit for tat type replacements, however, there are situations where I want to define a rule like if A is followed by B at any point in the future, apply this rule.p  pTo do this Im using a tree of structs as suchp  precodestruct node      listltstringgt common   the text which is not affected by conditions     string condition      matching this string selects the left, otherwise the right     node lptr, rptr     pointers to the child nodes, if needed  codepre  pAny time I encounter such a rule I can maintain the output with the rule both omitted and applied, delaying the decision of which to use until its resolved unambiguously.p  pIts somewhat memory wasteful, but seems the best way to avoid having to pass over the input data twice the size of the input data is unknown but probably less than 1 meg.p  pOf course such a case might exist that a different rule of this type triggers within one or both of the child nodes, so thats why a tree structure.p  pThere is no restriction that the children must be decided before their parents, it may be that the parent is only decidable on one branch of the child.  Encountering EOF would decide any undecided children in the false direction.p  pSo its clear I must be careful when rewinding and collapsing nodes.p  pIs there a simpler solution to this general problem  Is there a way to use standard library containers in a more efficient way than my tree presentsp

Negative 9650 pThere is a map placed as a background image on an html page. There is also a transparent image representing the sound waves originating from a certain point on the map, i.e the center of the waves. When the wave image is put on top of the map in its full size, the center of the wave image is on the correct position pointing the desired center point on the map with the codewaveImage positionabsolutebottom0right0code css rule.p  pProblem is that I need to dynamically scale the wave image, never larger than its original size, based on an arbitrary algorithm. Obviously, when the image is smaller, the center point is offset from the original center, towards the right and bottom due to the initial css positioning, so I have to move the wave image so that the center of the wave still points to the same location on the map. What I need is the algorithm to calculate the correct offsets from right and bottom. p  pSome information that may be of further help Wave image is 673px x 655px large, center of the wave is not on the center of the image.p

Negative 9650 pLets consider a simple classp  precodetemplatelt typename T gt class Wrapper  public    Constructors private   T wrapped  codepre  pWhat constructors should it use to be effectivep  hr  pBefore C0x there would be a constructor that takes eitherp  ol liconst reference codeT constampcode  if type codeTcode is heavy,li lior value codeTcode  if type codeTcode is light.li ol  pDetermining whether type codeTcode is heavy or light is not easy.p  pOne could assume only buildin types intsfloats... are light. But that is not fully correct since our own codeWrapperltintgtcode most likely should be considered a light type as well.p  pLibraries like a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1500libsutilitycalltraits.htm relnofollowcodeboostcalltraitscodea provide some means to overcome this difficulty by allowing type creator to mark the type as light by providing proper codecalltraitscode specialization. Otherwise it will be treated as heavy. Seems acceptable.p  hr  pBut C0x makes it worse. Because now you have also rvalue reference codeTampampcode which allows to efficiently take some heavy objects.p  pAnd because of this now you have to chose amongp  ol lijust const reference codeT constampcode  if type codeTcode is heavy and does not support move semantics because either there is none  like with large PODs  or none was written and you have no influence on that,li liboth const reference codeT constampcode and rvalue reference codeTampampcode  if type codeTcode is heavy and does support move semantics,li lijust value codeTcode  if type codeTcode is light or if it is heavy but supports move semantics even if copy is made it doesnt bother use since otherwise we would have to copy from codeT constampcode ourselves anyway....li ol  pStill its not easy to tell which types are heavy and which are light as previously. But now you are also unable to tell whether type codeTcode supports move semantics or not or are you.p  hr  pThis becomes even more annoying once you wrap more than one value since number of possible constructor overloads grows exponentially.p  pIs there any solution to that problemp  pI though about some template constructors for forwarding perfect forwarding arguments but I wasnt sure whether that would work as desired. And also it would allow to provide values of different type that would be just forwarded to codeTcode constructor. This might be considered a feature but does not have to.p

Negative 9650 pI have an NSMutableArray of NSNumbers. I enumerate over array, and for each 1 in there I need to check its position in array and do some stuff.

How do I fix that How to check the position of the stuff in array cellp  pWhy I need this and why I do it this way. Im making a tictactoe game. I store field in NSMutableArray with capacity of 9. So each number in array is a cell on play field. If the cell is empty, the array holds zero for that position, if there is x  there is 1 value in array, and if there is zero in cell  the array holds 2. When drawing time comes I iterate over array and check what value I see. If the value is zero I do nothing, but if it is one, I draw at certain position. Maybe there is easier way to do this, and you can point me in that direction if there is no way to fix my problem.p  pEDIT Working solution was to change the enumeration to usual loop.p  precode for int i  0 i lt 9 i           int temp  [[fieldArray objectAtIndexi] intValue]         if temp  1                      switch i                  case 0                                      CCSprite x  [CCSprite spriteWithFilex.png]                     x.position  ccp53, 265                     [self addChildx z1]                     break                                   case 1                                      CCSprite x  [CCSprite spriteWithFilex.png]                     x.position  ccp159, 265                     [self addChildx z1]                     break                  codepre

Previously, this same error occured but on a different functionvariable, and the resolution was to open up upnp.dll in oleview.exe to view Type Library Information and to replace all occurences of Unsigned Long with just Long and then compile a new TypeLib with the Unsigned keywords removed, this solved the problem for that senario.p  pNow, I need to solve the same problem but for a different functionvariable, but the problem is, I have no idea which variable datatype I need to change or remove when Im in oleviews TypeLib view of upnp.dll.p  pFor completeness, Ill let you know where this error is occuring, and then I will show you the relevant part of the oleviewTypeLib view that I am having trouble modifying. for your information, upnp.dll is contained in windowssystem32 and oleview.exe comes with the Windows SDK Toolkit if you do not already have it on your machine.p  pI am calling the function code.InvokeAction sActionName, aryIns, aryOutscode where aryIns and aryOuts are Variants declared like this codeDim aryIns As Variant, aryIns As Variantcode  basically, I declare it generally, put any input data I need inside aryIns and I will get aryOuts with the results of the InvokeAction call. The good thing is, InvokeAction turns my general Variant into a properly dimensioned array reflecting the number of output items that are returned for the ActionName Im using.p  pRe the point Im getting the error, I am using for sActionName GetStatusInfo on a WanIPConnection under the WAN Connection Device. I dont need to define any items for aryIns since this call doesnt require or need any input arguments, but it provided returns 3 items results and puts them in aryOuts. So aryOuts ends up as an array with items from index 0 to 2 3 items total... and when I loop through this aryOuts array, the items 0 and 1 are printed out and viewed perfectly without problems but on the 3rd item aryOuts2 I get the above exception.p  pBasically, the first 2 arguments are just simple strings no problem accessing these but the 3rd argument is defined by the UPnP people as an codeUnsigned 4 Byte Integercode and this is where the problem lays, VB6 is unable to interpret this datatype and is not letting me access this array item aryOuts2, and I could not figure out what part of the TypeLib I need to modify, since the definition for InvokeAction aryOuts is just stated as a VARIANT in the TypeLib, and here is the relevant part of the TypeLib for your view Ive included the area I understand to be relevant, if you would like additional areas posted, let me know and I can do thisp  precode[   odl,   uuidA295019CDC6547DD90DC7FE918A1AB44,   helpstringIUPnPService Interface,   dual,   nonextensible,   oleautomation ] interface IUPnPService  IDispatch      [id0x600209c5, helpstringmethod QueryStateVariable]     HRESULT QueryStateVariable                     [in] BSTR bstrVariableName,                      [out, retval] VARIANT pValue     [id0x600209c6, helpstringmethod InvokeAction]     HRESULT InvokeAction                     [in] BSTR bstrActionName,                      [in] VARIANT vInActionArgs,                      [in, out] VARIANT pvOutActionArgs,                      [out, retval] VARIANT pvRetVal     [id0x600209c7, propget, helpstringproperty ServiceTypeIdentifier]     HRESULT ServiceTypeIdentifier[out, retval] BSTR pVal     [id0x600209c8, helpstringmethod AddStateChangeCallback]     HRESULT AddCallback[in] IUnknown pUnkCallback     [id0x600209c9, propget, helpstringproperty Id]     HRESULT Id[out, retval] BSTR pbstrId     [id0x600209ca, propget, helpstringproperty LastTransportStatus]     HRESULT LastTransportStatus[out, retval] long plValue  codepre  pThe aryOuts array I was talking about before is defined by the strongcode[in, out] VARIANT pvOutActionArgscodestrong line in the strongcodeInvokeActioncodestrong declaration in the TypeLib above.

Negative 9650 pSo I know there are many ways for doing things in Backbone, but since I dont have the vast experience of many on here, I would like advice regarding a best approach.p  pI have a basic CRUD app where I have a form for adding data and a form for editing data, which are essentially the same. And actually are attached to the same DOM element.p  pSo I could include the two forms into one view and serve the appropriate template, depending on whether the view has a model or not. Something like thisp  precodevar AddEditView  Backbone.View.extend  el add, template editTemplate.html render function      if this.model          var theTmp  .templatethis.template         this.el.htmltheTmpthis.model.toJSON          else          var theTmp  .templateaddTemplate.html         this.el.htmltheTmp      , codepre  p I think this would work however I might run into some sticky issues with any events i.e. events being bound twice.p  pOr I could create two completely separate views that would be attached to the same dom element and would toggle back and forth depending on the app state way more lines of code.p  pWhat would you all recommend in this situation. Is more logic in a view better or more lines of code and less logic in viewsp

This significantly slows down page load time because I have to load in some data, transform it, perform my calculations based on parameters sent by the request, and then return the suggestions to the view. This has to be done every time the view is loaded.p  pI was wondering if there was some way I could have the recommender module load and transform the data in memory, and then wait for parameters to be sent from the view, have calculations run on those parameters and then send it back to the view. p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated.p
Negative 9650 pIve used GIMP to create a sprite using a transparent background. Once I put it in the Image Packer the transparent background disappears and the whole image is messed up. After a bit of googling without finding a single useful thing I decided to use a pink background, but I cant find support for setting a pixel to alpha I can read the pixels color thoughp  pHow do I fix this and have a transparent background in my sprite org.newdawn.slick.Image to be precisep  pUseful links None as far as I can remember. Took me 45 minutes to jump to this site for help, so theres either pretty much nothing or literally no support.p

Negative 9650 pI am having a RuntimeException error when calling Camera.setParameters from the method surfaceChanged. I saw other posts about the same issue, but didnt find a definite solution a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6830723problemwithsettingtheparameterstocameraproblem with setting the parameters to cameraap  pMy questions arep  ol lipWhy should surfaceChanged be called right after surfaceCreated It is counter intuitive  at least to me to start the preview in surfaceCreated, only to stop it and restart another one in surfaceChanged.pli lipWhen surfaceChanged is called for the first time, what decides the width and height that are passed in As suggested in the aforementioned post, and verified in my experiment, the values are not necessarily supported by Camera.setParameters. See below for my code snippet and log information.pli lipBefore surfaceChanged is called, is there a way to guarantee that the width and height values will be supported by Camera.setParameters It is possible to add code within surfaceChanged to ensure that. For example, w and h can be compared against all supported preview sizes, and be changed to the closest supported values. However, doing so will hinder performance.pli ol  pList below are my code snippet and the LogCat output. The logging info indicates that Camera.setParameters within surfaceChanged is causing the error.

Negative 9650 pPlists seem to have a limited number of data types that you can enter in.

Negative 9650 pIm looking for some input as to a good design patternmodel to use for refactoring a windows CE barcode scanning application used in a manufacturing plant.  Trying to make it a little more objectoriented and  a little less proceduralp  pCurrently, the bulk of the apps functionality is controlled by large case statements in essentially one main method, and the values of private integers determine which path to take through the cases.  p  pBecause many scans are performed in sequence, the code essentially loops through this main method after every barcode scan, until the user exits to the menu and selects a different scan functionality.   p  pFor many transaction types, the code needs to take multiple paths through the main case statement in sequence.  For example, the packing transaction requires the user to first scan their id badge, then scan the target container, and then scan the item to be packed in the target container, all of which are separate cases in the main method.  p  pIn this case, a very simplified examplep  precodeprivate int activeTrans private int baseTrans private int nextTrans  btnPackClick     nextTransaction  2    StartTransaction1, 1                 StartTransactionint transId, int transMode    determines the initial paths to take     switch transMode        case 1  scan parent        activeTrans  4       baseTrans  transId       break      a handful of other case statements representing the major types of transactions     ...       StartBarcodeRead the scanner prepared to scan, once the user scans a barcode,                       the HandleData method is called   HandleData    switch activeTrans        case 1  select target container       DoSomeMethodForTheTargetContainer       activeTrans  baseTrans      case 2  pack in container       DoThePackingMethod      case 3  scan id badge        ValidateIdBadgeScan        activeTrans  baseTrans        baseTrans  nextTrans      ... about 20 more cases for all the different transactions  codepre  pThis SEEMS to be a possible candidate for using the Command pattern, since each scanning function has the potential to be a stack or transactions to run in sequence, but Im not sure.  The code has been working fine  I only want to try refactoring it a bit because I can foresee the code getting more and more complex as requirements change or are added. p

Negative 9650 pNow this is a question for which I searched a lot of places,did a lot of coding but still am very confused. I am new to Java,so I was writing this program which saves an object data as a serialized object. The data members are two Strings. I read that when an object is serialized and stored in a file,the whole object state is saved. True. Then also the data is in binary form which cannot be read by humans or normal text editors. So when i stored the object using writeObject,it saved the data successfully,but when i open the file, it contains a lot of gibberish data,with the strings dispersed within. If i see a little more carefully, i can make out the strings clearly. So are the strings nit transformed into something else like in case of numeralsp

When I create new index for small collection, it takes lot of time indexing to complete so temp indexes are useless. It seems that RavenDB indexing process reads each document in DB and checks if it should be added to index. I think it would perform better to index only collections used by index.p  pAlso when using Smuggler to export data and I want to export only one small collection, it reads all documents and exporting might take quite a lot of time. Same time custom app which uses RavenDB Linq API and indexes can export data in seconds.p  pWhy RavenDB behaves like this And maybe there is some configuration setting which might change this behaviorp

Negative 9650 pAlright, so I want to embed my Twitch.TV video feed as well as the chat embed side by side. Another thing Im trying to do is make it so the video automatically resizes itself based on the browser resolution. p  pSo, first off for the resizing issue, Ive already changed the width100 which takes care of that, but from everything Ive researched and tried implementing minmax height, percentages, etc none of it seems to work. Is it possible to have the height scale with the width ie 1980 width  1080 height, 169, 1610, 43 based on browser If not, I think I might be fine having it at 400 height.p  pOnto my current issue. Ive looked all around for this one. Ive been able to research div, span, inline and it all works fine and well for text, but I cant get any of it to work with both embeds. Another thing to add, is that this is in a post on Joomla although Ive taken out tinymce and the other editors to make sure the html and code isnt interrupted.

Of course I can write my own, but assert is quite clever e.g. it knows not only the file and line number but even the expression which is not TRUE. I could of course dig into the library and CvCc a solution. But this is such an obvious generic request I cant believe there is not a good solution already.

Negative 9650 pI created an application and made a simple gui using the guy swing builder of Netbeans.  I created a jtextfield and a jlabel.

After that I activate my jlabel with a button. The jlabel shows up on top of the jtextfield as I wanted. When I deactivate the jlabel it disappears, but my input text has also disapeared.

Negative 9650 pMy app needs to detect simple gestures scroll, tap, long tap, and pinch zoom. Either detector works fine on its own  codeGestureDetector.SimpleOnGestureListenercode for tap  scroll and codeScaleGestureDetector.SimpleOnScaleGestureListenercode for pinch zoom. The problem is combining the two. More specifically, it is very hard to start pinch zoom so that a couple of codeonScrollcode events are not generated before codeonScaleBegincode. p  pIs there any good way to fix this The only solution I can think about is buffer a few events before processing them event queue, and discard codeonScrollcode  codeonTapcode without processing once codeonScaleBegincode is detected.

Imagine the codeDevicecode class has a counter, which we want to increment whenever we power on. How do we increment that counterp  pThe codeActioncode delegates used for Transition behaviors here do not take parameters from outside the codeFiniteStateMachinecode class, and Im pretty sure it would be terrible practice to be making changes to the containing class from in here anyway.p  pBut if Im not going to be implementing any of the actual behavior in this class, I feel like Ive missed the point of implementing a Finite State Machine in the first place. I understand the benefit of it throwing a null reference exception when I try to perform an illegal state change, but the plan was to have it encompass behavior as well. p  pIf it doesnt, then Im not actually changing any of the existing behavioral code Im just refactoring it to call codeProcessEventcode instead of setting the codeStatecode directly from the calling code. Safer, but not cleaner.p  pstrongSo my questions arestrongbr 1. What would be cleanest way to implement the behavioral elements of a finite state machine that affects its containing classbr 2.

Negative 9650 pA project I am working with implements three JAVA script timers from a Master Page to track the session time out and to do a heartbeat check. The setTimerout timer redirects the user to a warning page if the time out count reaches 1 and a half minutes before a session time out will occur. The two setInterval timers are implemented to track if the users browser is sill active on the site. Following are several code snippets that implement the timers and the Heartbeat and Heartbeat Check handlers.p  pMaster Page code to activate timersp  precodeDim BaseAccountTimeout As Single

continue to fire while a browser is on the site. As soon as the user closes the browser or navigates away from the site, even though the web application is still running, the only event that files is the ASP.NET SessionEnd event in Global.asax when the session times out. None of the timers will fire which I am assuming is caused by the fact that the Master Page is no longer loaded so the scripts on the Master do not fire.p  pI dont really care about the setTimeout timer, since there is no need to redirect to a timeout page if the browser is not longer active on the site, so that script can stay on the Master page. However, the two setInterval timers are what I am trying to keep running so the app can detect if the user has left the site and then the app can remove the session data and temp directories for that session.p  pMy question is this Does anyone know of a way to run these two scripts from a service or some other way to implement them so they will continue to fire even though the browser is closed or has gone to another sitep  pThanks Davidp  pPS. A little background The four global variables CurrentSessionTimeout, CurrentHeartBeatTimeout, DefaultHeartBeatTimeout, amp DefaultMissedHeartBeats and the two session variables UseSessionTimeout amp UseHeartBeat are set when the app starts from values stored in an SQL database. However, neither of the handlers use session variables, but instead get any values they need directly from global variables or the database since the session could have ended before the handler fires, that is if a page is still loaded, which goes back to the original reason for this post. p

Negative 9650 pThis is my first post on stackoverflow, so please forgive me if I make some mistakes.p  pIm a relatively new app designer, and I have been working on a new app that Im hoping to publish soon. I have recently run into an issue. I am not able to use codeUIActionSheetcode. While it displays fine, the buttons simply make the action sheet disappear. I have tried many things to no avail I did everything that was suggested in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions876209uiactionsheetnotrespondingtotouchesthis threada made by someone with a similar but not identical problem. I have tested and made sure that the function is not called altogether by using codeNSLogcode. I have tried changing the codeshowInViewcode, although it doesnt seem like that should make a difference anyway. So anyway, heres my current codep  precode voidmotionBeganUIEventSubtypemotion withEventUIEvent event      if  event.subtype  UIEventSubtypeMotionShake               UIActionSheet actionSheet  [[UIActionSheet alloc] initWithTitleYou Shook delegatenil cancelButtonTitleCancel destructiveButtonTitleEnd Game otherButtonTitlesSettings, nil]         [actionSheet showInViewself.view]           if  [super respondsToSelectorselectormotionEndedwithEvent]          [super motionEndedmotion withEventevent]    voidactionSheetUIActionSheet actionSheet clickedButtonAtIndexNSIntegerbuttonIndex      if buttonIndex  0              UIAlertView endGameAlertView  [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitleEnd Game messageAre you sure you want to end the current game delegatenil cancelButtonTitleNo otherButtonTitlesYes, nil]         [endGameAlertView show]            else              UIAlertView unimplementedSettingsAlertView  [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitleSorry messageThis feature is not yet implemented delegatenil cancelButtonTitleOkay otherButtonTitlesnil, nil]         [unimplementedSettingsAlertView show]       codepre  pAs you can see, the actionSheet is triggered by shaking the device which works perfectly, again, the only issue is that the buttons do nothing except for close the actionSheet. Im using Xcode 5.0.2 on OSX 10.9.1. Let me know if I left out any important information. Thank you in advancep  pJuniorp

Negative 9650 pIm building a train timetable site, using jquery mobile. On each station page it comes up with the services departing that station, each service being a collapsible header, and when it is clicked on it brings up the full list of stations on that run, and how long until the train arrives at each station. Its all working fine for the first one, but for all the others, there are 2 random instances before the proper list begins, the first being a capital letter and the next being a number. Its probably easier to explain with screenshots so  a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsty5xvbyrovbi9lrScreenshot20201401092009.40.56.png relnofollowFirst onea works fine, a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comsafis4wgkfmfn0uoScreenshot20201401092009.41.11.png relnofollowSecond onea random bits, all others after this are the same, but the letter and number change seemingly randomly. Why is it doing that,  where are they coming from and more importantly how do I get rid of themp  pEDIT The letter seems to be the first letter of the service before the clicked one So if the first one starts with B, then the random letter will be B for the second one.p  pEDIT The number is the starting number of the time until the train terminates on the service prior so if it terminates in 70 minutes, the number is 7, if it is in 4 hours, it is 4 I have it so it rounds to hours once the hours is 2 or morep  pCodep  precode  start of html document, connect to db etc. ltphp  try      sql  SELECT timetable.id as id, day, station, departs as time, CURTIME, ROUNDTIMETOSECdeparts60  TIMETOSECCURTIME60,0 as departs, platform, route, run, route.code, line.name, station.name as terminus, line.colour FROM timetable INNER JOIN route ON timetable.route  route.id INNER JOIN line ON route.line  line.id INNER JOIN station ON route.terminus  station.id WHERE station   .

Negative 9650 pI have been writing some GUI test frameworks that can record and replay some GUI user scenario by recording mouse and keyboard events and replaying them. p  pThe mouse events are currently recorded as codepress or release, x, ycode. However, this is very fragile because if only the destination widget moves by a few pixels, but the structure and everything else stays the same, the testcase ceases to work. p  pWhat is a better approach to do this Some things that I can think aboutp  ul lipRecord the tree path of the destination widget in the tree of widgets and their parent widgets. I.e. codepress or release, top level, first child, second child, destinationcode, where the child list is what is returned by Qts codeQObjectcode child list. I think this has the drawback that the test now is dependent on the internal code structure.pli lipGive emeveryem testable widget a unique name and when replaying search the widget with that name. This seems to be a nonnegletible overhead. pli ul  pAny other ideas, and what is the commonly accepted best approach to thisp

Negative 9650 pI recently began using AngularJS in a web app that up to this point has been mostly jQuery based. One of the UI components in this app uses jQuery UIs draggable, which uses CSSs codeleftcode property to position objects while being dragged. The problem I am having is that I bind codeleftcode to a percentage value held in a scope property.p  precodeltdiv classseeker datangstyle left position   gt     ltdiv classhandlegtltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pI figured it would be simple enough to listen for the drag codestopcode event and do the conversion myself. This works fine in most cases, but despite having set the codecontainmentcode field to the parent element code.timelinecontrolcode of the draggable element, sometimes the draggable element ends up slightly outside its parent. The follow code compensates for those situations.p  precodelink function scope, elem, attrs      elem.find.seeker.draggable         axis x,         containment elem.find.timelinecontrol,         stop function event, ui              var t  event.target             var position  t.position.left  t.parent.outerWidth  100             position  Math.minposition, 100             position  Math.maxposition, 0             scope.applyfunction                   scope.position  position                             codepre  pThe problem with this code is that if the draggable element is dragged outside the parents far right, the codescope.positioncode binding is only updated the first time it is set to 100. The binding does not occur on successive drags. I realize this is because scope.position value has not actually changed and is not considered dirty by the framework, but the elements style has changes, so I would like for the binding to take place anyway.p  h2strongEditstrongh2  pa hrefhttpplnkr.coeditIzY04gQ9oCa5dGVsnHzQ relnofollowHerea is a plunker demonstrating the behavior. Drag the red bar to the far right of the container and release it. At this point it works as expected. Drag it to the right and release again and you will see that the red bar breaks containment jqueryui draggable bug. Repeat to see the behavior.p  pResearch into the problem with jQuery draggable not keeping containment led me to a hrefhttpbugs.jqueryui.comticket7016 relnofollowthisa issue.p  pI can think of a number of hackish ways to make this work, but I was hoping there was a clean solution out there, like explicitly marking the property dirty.

When were doing maintenance on the server we want to display a message to our users telling them the server is under maintenance rather than just Remote Logins Disabled.p  pI found how to set the legal message to display prior to log on, however the problem is that RDP is prompting for credentials before connecting to the server, so the legal message isnt being displayed, and it just takes them straight to Remote Logins Disabled.p  pWhat Im wondering is, is there a way I can change the default login behavior to take the users to a windowsstyled login screen rather than prompting for credentials in the RDP connection window, where the legal notification aka maintenance notification in this case will be displayed before they enter their credentials, similar to server 2003s login behaviorp

Negative 9650 pI just recently started making a VST Host and for that im using the VST.NET library for C. Now im trying to create the routing between the Line in, through the Plugins and to the Line Out. My plan is to record the audio in the host and sent the recorded buffer live when recorded not saving a temporary file to the first plugin. The output of the first Plugin which will be an Effects Plugin will the go live to the next plugin. After it got routed through all necessary plugins it should be routed to an audio output device.p  pFor the recording part i already took a look at NAudio and created the recording part like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15101889hearingtheincomingaudiofrommicthisa. Now i can get the Audio Buffer in my isDataAvailable method in the form of a byte array. Problem being that VST.NET uses the ProcessReplacing method i think to process audio to a plugin and this method requires a buffer in form of an instance of a VstAudioBuffer Array and the constructor of VstAudioBuffer requires a float buffer.p  pNow how should i convert those variables to send them to the plugin Also in the end how can i then convert them back to send to WaveOutp  pAnother question Can i, after i call plugin1.processreplacing to send the recorded data to plugin1 call plugin2.processreplacing with the parameters inputBuffer being the outputbuffer of the processreplacingcall to plugin1 to send the processed audio to plugin2p  pI tried to modify the example from the link and made thisp  precodevoid waveInDataAvailableobject sender, WaveInEventArgs e              if waveProvider  null             waveProvider.AddSamplese.Buffer, 0, e.BytesRecorded         int bytesRead  waveProvider.ReadnaudioBuf,0,e.BytesRecorded         naudioBuf  e.Buffer          unsafe                      fixed byte byteBuf  ampnaudioBuf[0]                              float floatBuf  floatbyteBuf                 for int i  0 i lt e.BytesRecorded i                                      vstBufIn[0][i]  floatBuf  i                                                 cont.PluginCommandStub.MainsChangedtrue         cont.PluginCommandStub.StartProcess         cont.PluginCommandStub.ProcessReplacingvstBufIn, vstBufOut         cont.PluginCommandStub.StopProcess         cont.PluginCommandStub.MainsChangedfalse          unsafe                      float tmpBufL  IDirectBufferAccess32vstBufOut[0].Buffer             byte[] buffer  BitConverter.GetBytestmpBufL             waveOutProv.AddSamplesbuffer, 0, buffer.Length               codepre  pThe setup for WaveIn and Out looks like thisp  precode        WaveIn waveIn  new WaveInthis.Handle         waveIn  new WaveInthis.Handle         waveIn.BufferMilliseconds  25         waveIn.DataAvailable  waveInDataAvailable          waveProvider  new BufferedWaveProviderwaveIn.WaveFormat         waveOutProv  new BufferedWaveProviderwaveIn.WaveFormat          waveOut  new WaveOut         waveOut.DesiredLatency  100         waveOut.InitwaveOutProv          waveIn.StartRecording         waveOut.Play          this.sampleRate  44100         this.channels  2         this.blockSize  4410          cont.PluginCommandStub.SetBlockSizeblockSize         cont.PluginCommandStub.SetSampleRatefloatsampleRate          vstBufManIn  new VstAudioBufferManagerchannels, blockSize  channels         vstBufManOut  new VstAudioBufferManagerchannels, blockSize  channels          vstBufIn  vstBufManIn.ToArray         vstBufOut  vstBufManOut.ToArray          naudioBuf  new byte[blockSize  channels  4] codepre  pIm getting an output and it also gets louder when the input in the mic is louder but its just a weird clicking noise.

The code would need to enter the productid into an array and check whether it is unique. If the productid is unique to the array, then the productid is echoed out unaltered, and parent is echoed out to the ParentChild column and then the productid is repeated to the Parent SKU column. p  pHowever, if the array is checked and the productid already exists in the array, then the productid is echoed out to the SKU column with a suffix i.e. 1. Then child is echoed to the Parent  Child column and the original parent productid echoed to the Parent SKU column. p  pHOWEVER  the same SKU cannot be repeated with the same suffix i.e. 123451, 123451  so presumably there would be to be another array for the suffixed SKUs to be checked against. p  pIf anybody could help, it would be great.  Thanksp  p UPDATE emANSWERem p  pI managed to solved this myself and thought I would share my solution for future reference. p  precode       Array to collect productids and check whether unique.

Negative 9650 pI have somehow deeply borked by entire repository used only by me and could use some assistance in sorting it out. p  pHere is what I did. I realized that in my commit history, there were some files containing credentials that I did not want just laying around. So, I decided to be legit and try to use the BFG RepoCleaner to fix these issues. I threw all the credentials in .gitignores, and moved on to trying to scrub them out of the history. As per the documentation instructions, I executed these commandsp  precodegit clone mirror myrepo.git java jar bfg.jar deletefiles stuffthatshouldbedeleted.txt  myrepo.git codepre  pAt this point, BFG told me that x number of files had been found and removed. Sweet.p  precodecd myrepo.git git reflog expire expirenow all git gc prunenow aggressive git push codepre  pAccording to the terminal logs, it updated the repo. So far so good, right I pop into my github account, and after a few clicks, find the credentials still there, file and all, in my history. I go back and try the same set of commands, but using this line instead of the file removerp  precodejava jar bfg.jar replacetext passwords.txt  myrepo.git codepre  pwhere passwords.txt is a file containing string instances of all the credentials I would like gone. Again, BFG logs indicate that there are several instances that it has fixed. I push up, check, and the credentials are still there, sitting in Github. I notice that the SHA1 keys for all of my commits have been altered, so presumably BFG did something, just not the thing I want it to do.p  pAt this point, I give up and try to get back to work, figure Ill sort it out later. I do some work, try to push up, get a weird merge conflict you are 50 ahead and 50 behind on commits. What I try to pull and merge, and suddenly, every single commit in my git history is duplicated in name, and some of them are just blank. I check my Github network graph, and it looks like there is a second branch starting from my initial commit that exactly mirrors all of my commits that has been zippered in with my last commit I have never branched, just been linearly chugging along.p  pI cant revert to a previous commit, because they are all chronologically duplicated. My credentials are still in there, with twice as many instances now, and my history is doubled and very confusing to try to understand. When I try to run BFG from the beginning now, cloning and mirroring the repo anew, it tells me that there are no credentials in it, despite the fact that I can see them in Github. I could really use some help in understanding what happened, and how, if at all, I can get back to a state of things again.p  pI am considering just deleting the entire repo and starting anew. I really dont want to do that.p  ptldr Tried using BFG, somehow duplicated halfbaked versions of all commits in my repo, cant untangle, and to add insult to injury, BFG did nothing and claims its done its job. p

Negative 9650 pHello fellow StackOverflow users. Currently I am writing tests via selenium and python to test the webcontent of the site I am working for. Some of the pages are dynamically filled out with updated content, so I recently wrote a function that tests the links from that content. Since its dynamic, no class names, strings, or xpaths stay the same. Thus the function retrieves the list of links after obtaining the description of a container in which the data is filled out. Here is the functionp  precodedef dynamictestself, by, target, extent     Testing the dynamic content of the container from bottom up     container  self.waitforelementby, target     linklist  container.findelementsbytagnamea     if lenlinklist gt 0         try             depth  intextent             if depth gt lenlinklist                 depth  lenlinklist         except ValueError             if notstrextent  all                 raise ValueErrorExtent of dynamic test not recognized s   strextent             else                 depth  lenlinklist         while notdepth  0             depth  depth  1             self.clicklinkbypositionby, target, depth             if lenself.webdriver.windowhandles gt 1                 self.switchtowindow1                 self.webdriver.close                 self.switchtowindow0             else                 self.back     else         if container.text not in self.nodata             printWARNING  Nonexistent no data string s   container.text         else             pass codepre  pSome of the extra functions that it uses is waitforelement which also uses waitp  precodedef waitself, func, error, timeoutsettings.waittimeout     Helper function to handle generic webdriver waits     stoptime  time  timeout     while time lt stoptime         try             return func         except WebDriverException, NoSuchElementException             sleepsettings.attemptdelay     raise TimeoutExceptionerror  def waitforelementself, by, target     Wait for an element to be available     by  self.getbymethodby     return self.waitlambda self.webdriver.findelementby, target,                      cannot find element s  target codepre  pAnd the last one is clicklinkbypositionp  precodedef clicklinkbypositionself, by, target, position     Clicks on an element by the position of href     try         iteration  intposition     except ValueError         raise ValueErrorWrong value for clicklinkbyposition input d  position     container  self.waitforelementby, target     linklist  container.findelementsbytagnamea     if iteration lt lenlinklist         for index, link in enumeratelinklist             if index  iteration                 link.click     else         raise ValueErrorPosition out of containers bounds d for bound d   iteration, lenlinklist  codepre  pA huge problem for me is the fact that if it tests too many links then the webdriver overloads for some reason and the browser hangs On Firefox specifically.

Turns out the cell updating is the problem, I have the following codep  precodeSub test     Application.ScreenUpdating  False     Application.Calculation  xlCalculationManual     Application.EnableEvents  False     Application.EnableCancelKey  False     t  Timer         With RangeA1             .Font.Italic  True             .Interior.ColorIndex  37             .Value  3412         End With     Debug.Print Timer  t     Application.ScreenUpdating  True     Application.Calculation  xlCalculationAutomatic     Application.EnableEvents  True     Application.EnableCancelKey  True End Sub codepre  pthe debug print is about 0.3 to 0.5 sec... I have afterwards further wrapped the timer around each of the codeitaliccode, codecolorIndexcode, and codevaluecode lines and they all turns out take about 0.015 sec each... I have tried searching online how to make the code more efficient, hence the codescreenupdatingcode toggles as well as no codeselectioncode, but 0.5 sec still seem a bit slow in updating a cell to me.p  pplease note that I am not whining, I just want to know if I am doing the right thing here. Is there a more efficient way to implement the formatting and value changes that I posted here, or is it just a fact that excel takes this amount of time to update the cell I am just very curious because the json reading and parsing that I also implemented are significantly faster than this.p  pAlso I have tested this script on at least 3 computers and they all take around the same time so I dont think its an individual computer problem. And I used excel 2007 and 2010 to test.p
Negative 9650 pIm trying to test some ideas on a Tabbed Application preset  what I want to do is have the main view 90 container for subsequent views which is working fine so far and have a persistent status bar at the top showing a UILabel that can be updated from the subsequent views, however am having trouble updating the label.p  pIn seeking a solution I have attempted both a global variable and protocol approach. p  pWhilst I can set the label text to be that of the global variable when the main view is loaded, I cannot figure out how to refresh the label once the global variable has been changed in a subsequent view.

Negative 9650 pstrongOverviewstrong I have built a simple MVC application that retrieves data from a SQL database, and then stores that information Name, address, city ect into a collection. After retrieving the necessary information I want the application to then take that collection of data and pass it into a MS Word mail merge I have created to print Avery envelopes. The application also stores a quantity the user would like to print.  p  pstrongWhat I expect to happenstrong The application looks at the Word document for the necessary form fields such as Address and then enter the first item in the collection into that form field until the designated quantity is reached If they entered a quantity of 10 then the first item would be inserted into Word 10 times. It would then do the same for the next item until all items have been placed into to Word Document.p  pstrongWhat is happeningstrong The application is only entering the first item in my collection to all form fields in Word.

Negative 9650 pIve got a WPF codeTextBoxcode with codeTwoWaycode binding to a ViewModel property. I also have a codeToolBarcode with a codeButtoncode. When the Button is clicked, it executes a codecommandcode on the same codeViewModelcode that will do something with the property the codeTextBoxcode is bound to.p  pUnfortunately it looks like the codeBindingcode only sends the text back to the binding target when the codeTextBoxcode loses focus.

Negative 9650 pPaypal seems to be pushing for using the REST API, but I have not found a way to implement a basic recurring payment functionality such as the one below.p  pI have the following scenario user subscribes to three products using their credit card, then two months later the user decides to remove one of the products. How do I go about updating the recurring amount The only way I have been able to do this so far is by creating a new plan and new agreement, and I find it quite odd to ask the user to reenter their credit card and address information when they are removing a product from their subscription  I could maybe see it if they were adding one or perhaps just asking for the CVV.p  pThings I have triedp  ol liUpdating the amount of a plan  an exception is thrown telling me that property cannot be patch updated.li liCreating a new plan, and assigning the agreement to this new plan  same error as above.li liStoring the credit card in the vault, then using it to create a new agreement  well you cannot use a stored credit card to create an agreement.li ol  pUpdating the amount is very easily done using the classic API, and unless I am missing something here it would appear that paypal is pushing for a product that lacks basic functionality.p  pSecondly, returnurl and cancelurl seem to be required, this is an agreement based on a credit card.p  pThanksp
Negative 9650 pThis is just a portion of of my project that I hit a road block on, but basically what I am facing right now is this. I have a text file full of commands that I read individually line by line into a an array I named tokens[]. tokens[0] has the command it is calling, while token[1] or anything else is a name or anything that is used with the method. In this case token[0] is a addlist method that it invokes, and token[1] is the name of the list. What is the best way to create a list of strings with name from token[1]. This method could be called multiple times in which it needs to create another list if it doesnt exist already. What type of structure should I use for this, and how could I go about this Thanks for the help in advancep

Negative 9650 pIm developing an app that needs to run on one Windows Phone 8 device.

Basically, in the default settings, all the charts look absolutely weird, they are either too big, part of the legend is missing, parts overlap etc.p  pI therefore looked into the documentation for highcharts and found that I probably need to play around with the three parameters, the width, height and scale.

Negative 9650 pI have been researching and debugging this problem in my app for days, but I still cant get an answer. So I think it would be best to just ask the question. And here we go...p  pSuppose that we create an instance of a class on the main thread, but place the call of one method of that class on a different thread using dispatchasync. Would it be threadsafe if that method uses properties in the class The class instance is created on the main thread. Surely accessing the properties would be crossthread. An example would bep  precodeinterface AClass  property nonatomic int blah Would it be more threadsafe if it is atomic instead  voidfoo  end  Method implementation  voidfoo     self.blah   dispatchasync on main thread dispatchasyncdispatchgetglobalqueue...PRIORITYBACKGROUND, 0,     [aClassInstance foo]  codepre  pI do have a recursive method in one of the classes in my app that accesses properties. Its only that that method is meant to be called on a different thread, so not to block the UIKit thread. However, the memory just keeps climbing at 30MB per second when the method is executing I think this has something to do with a leak and multithreading, but I cannot seem to find the leak in Instruments. So I am here to ask if it is threadsafe to access properties like this.p  pIm sorry if my question is hard to understand, I am not a native speaker . Thanks for dropping in.p

Negative 9650 pI would like to suggest a new widget that I have called a Row Detail  Vertical Grid.p  pBackground. The KendoUI Grid that we know and love displays a list that is x columns wide and has a row for each record in the dataset. p  pWhen we wish to see the details of a single record from the grid, then one common layout is to present the records fields x number of columns in a table that is 2 columns wide with the column label in the left and the data value in the right x rows deep.p  pI would like this 2 column table a vertical grid to be available as a preconfigured widget. I believe it would be a great time saver over laying out labels and value fields in a html or css derived table format.p  pI hope I have explained it clearly.  If this is already available please forgive my ignorancep

Negative 9650 pLets assume a major mode has a key binding for codeC[code. p  pDepending on the keyboard layout, typing code[code involves an codeAltGrcode keystroke for instance codeAltGr8code on a German keyboard. If I try codeCAltGr8code, Emacs simply parses this as an codeESCcode keystroke. If I now repeat codeAltGr8code I can produce a codeM[code, but so far I havent found a way to type codeC[code.p  pIs there a general solution for this problem Obviously I can rebind this specific command to something else, but I was trying to find a solution that works for all such keys affected on a German layout codecode, code[code, code]code, codecode, codecode, codecode, codecode and across different Emacs modes.p  pIn case this is not platform independent Linux solution preferred GNU Emacs 24.4.1.p

Negative 9650 pI wanted to add the screen space ambient occlusion to my application. I tried out with the SSAO code in Opengls Superbible sixth edition but I am wondering that the shader code is dependent on the camera position even if the view coordinate system is not changed and sometimes causes black holes in the shape. Because the code has a part which increase the occlusion value codeocc  4.0  1.0  dcode, but the problem is that the codefloat d  abstheirdepth  mydepthcode, and if the d is getting so small by getting close to the object, a big value will be added to codeocclusioncode, and it causes black holes. Should I remove the dependency of codeocclusion valuecode on the code4.0  1.0  dcode and simply replace it with codeocc  1.0code or there is some ways to solve itp  precodeversion 430 core   Samplers for prerendered color, normal and depth layout binding  0 uniform sampler2D sColor layout binding  1 uniform sampler2D sNormalDepth   Final output layout location  0 out vec4 color   Various uniforms controling SSAO effect uniform float ssaolevel  1.0 uniform float objectlevel  1.0 uniform float ssaoradius  5.0 uniform bool weightbyangle  true uniform uint pointcount  8 uniform bool randomizepoints  true   Uniform block containing up to 256 random directions x,y,z,0  and 256 more completely random vectors layout binding  0, std140 uniform SAMPLEPOINTS      vec4 pos[256]     vec4 randomvectors[256]  points  void mainvoid       Get texture position from glFragCoord     vec2 P  glFragCoord.xy  textureSizesNormalDepth, 0      ND  normal and depth     vec4 ND  textureLodsNormalDepth, P, 0      Extract normal and depth     vec3 N  ND.xyz     float mydepth  ND.w       Local temporary variables     int i     int j     int n      float occ  0.0     float total  0.0       n is a pseudorandom number generated from fragment coordinate      and depth     n  intglFragCoord.x  7123.2315  125.232           intglFragCoord.y  3137.1519  234.8           intmydepth      Pull one of the random vectors     vec4 v  points.randomvectors[n amp 255]       r is our radius randomizer     float r  v.r  3.0  0.1     if randomizepoints         r  0.5       For each random point or direction...     for i  0 i lt pointcount i               Get direction         vec3 dir  points.pos[i].xyz           Put it into the correct hemisphere         if dotN, dir lt 0.0             dir  dir           f is the distance weve stepped in this direction          z is the interpolated depth         float f  0.0         float z  mydepth           Were going to take 4 steps  we could make this          configurable         total  4.0          for j  0 j lt 4 j                       Step in the right direction             f  r              Step towards viewer reduces z             z  dir.z  f               Read depth from current fragment             float theirdepth                  textureLodsNormalDepth,                            P  dir.xy  f  ssaoradius, 0.w               Calculate a weighting d for this fragments              contribution to occlusion             float d  abstheirdepth  mydepth             d  d               If were obscured, accumulate occlusion             if z  theirdepth gt 0.0                              occ  4.0  1.0  d                                  Calculate occlusion amount     float aoamount  vec41.0  occ  total       Get object color from color texture     vec4 objectcolor   textureLodsColor, P, 0       Mix in ambient color scaled by SSAO level     color  objectlevel  objectcolor              mixvec40.2, vec4aoamount, ssaolevel  codepre

Negative 9650 pIm looking for a cloud data storage service which offers the followingp  ul liData is stored in duplicate or moreli liData is identical between original and duplicates at all times i.e. sync originalduplicate is instant or data storage requests dont return until all instances have returned successfullyli liIf the original fails, we should be able to use the duplicates as if it were the originalli ul  pSo my specific question isp  ul liDoes such a storage solution exist If so, where can we find itli liAnd if not, are there any best practices for handling the duplicate instance missing data from the original in codeli ul  pMany cloud services offer some form of persistence and replication, but there is usually a delay or synchronisation moment between the instances, which in many cases can lead to the duplicate not containing all of the data of the original. This is often in the order of a few seconds to a few minutes, but even such a small timeframe can be quite significant. Were looking to eliminate this delay entirely.p  pBackgroundbr Currently Im working on a matchmaking system for an online game. This system must be very reliable, and must have as little downtime as possible. So far our setup has been to use any number of servers, and have them all connect to the same storage unit so they can all work with the same dataset. Specifically, currently our servers are Azure Webroles, and our storage unit is an Azure Redis cache. However, Redis suffers the same issue as described above delay of 1s, so were looking for any alternatives.p

Negative 9650 pI have imported a spreadsheet to a Sharepoint list. However, I have numbered my items and two numbers were missing 7 and 1054.  So this threw off my ID system. I was wondering how I can go about fixing this, because when someone adds another item. I want the next consecutive number. According to my system we have 1067 items, but the ID system has 1065 items, and when I add another item, the ID system goes into 1066, instead I want it to follow my system, so when I add an item. It goes to 1068. I am fairly new to Sharepoint and Infopath so please bear with me. Thank youp

Negative 9650 pjre1.8 now appears in eclipse however my old jres Except jre6 now say they are unbound I have no idea what that means but now they dont work. I dont really care which jre I use but the new one which has now defaulted on eclipse brings up compilation errors for anything to do with JComponent It asks me to configure the build path.  I would post screenshots but I am a newbie here and I am not allowed.p  pIve just realised adding both the new jre and jre6 my only working old one fixes the problem. However its not a very clean solution and I would like an answer as to why the new jre doesnt know what a JComponent isp

Hopefully, i would be able to explain my problem.p  pI have an application where i get notifications. On one closenotification, i delete my object and unregister from the notification.p  pI am using visualstudio and have put up consoleprintfunction name and some variable when a function is hit without stopping. When i play with my app, i see a crash. I have a vector with some objects, the vector is usually of size 1.p  pOn looking through the console log i find that whenever, my app works fine, i see three messages showing the size of vector before and stacktrace in destructor of object and size of vector after the deletion of object. This is like 1 and some stack and 0, since i remove the object.p  pHowever, at the workflow of crash, i see only the first message with size 1, then i see the stack trace that i put in the destructor of object but no message with size 0. However, there are other lines with p  precodeThe thread 0x2164 has exited with code 0 0x0. The thread 0x1734 has exited with code 0 0x0. The thread 0x670 has exited with code 0 0x0.

Negative 9650 pIm new to the iOS UI development and I need some help to figure out, what is the best way to implement image belt sequence of images in horizontal belt. I dont need details someone to write me the code, just guidance what I should focus on learning as a libraries and most important design patterns by design patters I mean software design for iOS UI.p  pThe task details 1. I will have image belt  sequence of few related images. This will be my horizontal transition. The transition animation will be simple push animation something like push CATransion, initiated by swipe leftright. On top of the images there will be overlay with some text, icon info and etc. The overlay info will be the same for all images in the current belt. 2. I will have multiple image belts  this will be my vertical transition. The transition between belts will be triggered by swipe updown. The different belts will contain unrelated information, so the information shown in overlays from point 1 must be also changed. The animation will be also simple push animation as in point 1.p  pI probably should inherit UIView and implement my belt as one object, which will consist of different UIViewoverlay and UIImageViewsfor the images. Am I on the right trackp  pSome helpful brainstorm will be highly appreciated.p

This way, i can put a gate on the auto deploys that happening every 30mins. i referred the chef docs, there is this deploybranch but i not sure it just says its the same as deployrevision.  a hrefhttpsdocs.chef.ioresourcedeploy.htmllayoutmodifiers relnofollowhttpsdocs.chef.ioresourcedeploy.htmllayoutmodifiersap  pThere is an attribute branch available as per the chef document. So adding the attribute like is what i needp  precodedeployrevision optmountnode[applicationname] do   repo node[applicationrepo]   user deployer   branch node.chefenvironment       keepreleases 10   action deploy   migrate false   symlinkbeforemigrate.clear   createdirsbeforesymlink   purgebeforesymlink.clear   symlinks.clear   symlinks    notifies restart, service[abc] end codepre  pThen, i came across this bug report closed a hrefhttpstickets.opscode.combrowseCHEF5084 relnofollowhttpstickets.opscode.combrowseCHEF5084a. It seems to be specifying branches with the attribute, revision. So, can i use this attribute with the node environment as the parameter Like thisp  precoderevision node.chefenvironments codepre  pIf you guys, think deployment using chef is not a good idea. Do you think i should look out for Capistranop

Negative 9650 pSo, I am creating this app that involves the creation of routines in a table view. Once you create this routine in the table view, you are then given the option to look inside this routine. Once you look inside it, you are presented with another table view that holds a set of tasks each, all of these created by the user. I am using Core Data, and Im having problems in my data model assigning the task to the routine that its in. What happens in the simulator is that all of the tasks that Ive created can be seen in all of the routines.

Negative 9650 pQuartz.net has the following example of implementing the IJob interface a hrefhttpwww.quartzscheduler.netdocumentationquartz2.xtutorialmoreaboutjobs.html relnofollowherea.  They do this through the example of DumbJob.p  pThe last example of DumbJob they refer to what they do as relying on JobFactory to injecting the data map values onto your class.  However this only works with strings, floats, ints, and bools.  You can also give the DumbJob a property of a different type, but you would never be able to set it.  You cant pass the property through the UsingJobData call and since JobBuilder returns an IJobDetail object back that cant be successfully cast into the job type to set the properties normally or at least I havent bee able to.  Is there a way of giving implementations properties of different types available or would I need to implement my own JobFactory to get this to workp

Negative 9650 pTheres a lot of people reporting issues with nginx and virtualbox. Solution that works for most seems to be using codesendfile offcode in nginx config. Ive been experiencing similar problem with corrupted codejscode and codecsscode files after updates. I tried switching codesendfilecode to codeoffcode in nginx config and restarting VM but this did not help. I decided to serve application through uwsgi only instead of uwsginginx but the problem persisted.p  pIn my case I have a Flask application that resides in host filesystem and is shared with VM to codehomevagrantappnamecode. After doing some experimenting I found out that copying application files into VMs filesystem fixes the issue. This way code now actually resides in codehomevagrantappnamecode.  I still dont know exactly what is causing this and preferably I would like the codebase to reside on host for easy editing.p

Negative 9650 pI am writing my first Python 3.4 application using SQLalchemy.  I have several methods which all have a very similar pattern.  They take an optional argument codesessioncode which defaults to codeNonecode.  If codesessioncode is passed, the function uses that session, otherwise it opens and uses a new session.  For example, consider the following methodp  precodedef stocksself, sessionNone     Return a list of all stocks in database.     newsession  False     if not session         newsession  True         session  self.db.Session     stocks  [stock.ticker for stock in session.queryStock.all]     if newsession         session.close     return stocks codepre  pSo, being new to Python and eager to learn all of its power, I thought this smelt like the perfect time to learn a little something about Python decorators.  So after a lot of reading, like this a hrefhttpwww.artima.comweblogsviewpost.jspthread240808 relnofollowthis series of blog postsa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma15944844530863thisa fantastic SO answer, I wrote the following decoratorp  precodefrom functools import wraps  def sessionmanagerfunc          Manage creation of session for given function.      If a session is passed to the decorated function, it is simply     passed through, otherwise a new session is created.  Finally after     execution of decorated function, the new session if created is     closed          wrapsfunc     def innerthat, sessionNone, args, kwargs         newsession  False         if not session             newsession  True             session  that.db.Session         functhat, session, args, kwargs         if newsession             session.close         return functhat, session, args, kwargs     return inner codepre  pAnd it seems to work great.  The original method is now reduced top  precodesessionmanager def stocksself, sessionNone     Return a list of all stocks in database.     return [stock.ticker for stock in session.queryStock.all] codepre  pHOWEVER, when I apply the decorator to a function that takes some positional arguments in addition to the optional codesessioncode, I get an error.  So trying to writep  precodesessionmanager def stockexistsself, ticker, sessionNone          Check for existence of stock in database.      Args         ticker str Ticker symbol for a given companys stock.         session obj, optional Database session to use.  If not             provided, opens, uses and closes a new session.      Returns         bool True if stock is in database, False otherwise.          return boolsession.queryStock                 .filterbytickerticker                 .count                  codepre  pand running like codeprintclient.manager.stockexistsAAPLcode gives an codeAttributeErrorcode with the following tracebackp  precodeTraceback most recent call last   File CCodedevelopmentPynancepynance.py, line 33, in ltmodulegt     printclient.manager.stockexistsGPX   File CCodedevelopmentPynancepynancedecorators.py, line 24, in inner     functhat, session, args, kwargs   File CCodedevelopmentPynancepynancedatabasedatabase.py, line 186, in stockexists     .count AttributeError NoneType object has no attribute query [Finished in 0.7s] codepre  pSo I am guessing by the traceback, that I am messing up the order of the arguments, but I cant figure out how to order them properly.

Negative 9650 pI have to develop a technical design for multi site communication. Each site has a same internal interface that exposes its functionality through SOAP API. The designed applicationhosted on each site will communicate to this interface for insertupdatedelete operations.  One of the primary responsibility of the designed application is to get the information from its local internal interface and to expose it to all other sites. So, each site application will need to publish its information to all other site applications and based on the information sent from other sites, a local site designed application will do the insert operation to its local internal interface.p  pFor this requirement, I can think of three design approachesp  p1 Design a Central Server Application exposing REST API. Each site designed applicationclient will communicate to its internal interface to fetch the information and then will send it to central server through REST API. This central server will manage all the information from all the site clients. At the same time each client is asking for the information of other sites from this central server and updating the information through its local interfaceSOAP API.p  p2Avoid this central server concept. Design to have a ring communication.  Each site has a serverproviding REST API and client where server is responsible for contacting its local internal interface. Client will communicate to all other site servers to get the information and will post it to its local serverprobably by making web socket.p  p3Design application of each site will get the information from all other sites and at the same time communicating to its local internal interface to do its required operations. Design application is hosted on some web server.p  pAs per my understanding, first approach looks best and then second looks as an second best alternative.p  pCan expert please give their suggestions for each of the approachp

How can you set the iframe height to the size of the iframe content when the content is from another domain Im using the following javascript but I get the codepermission denied to access property documentcode because the iframe content is from another domain.p  precodefunction resizeIframeiframe          ififrame.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight lt 500            iframe.height  500px          else            iframe.height  iframe.contentWindow.document.body.scrollHeight  px                ltiframe namemyiframe idmyiframe onloadsetIframeHeightthis.id... codepre  pIve read up on a few hacks but they all include using a second javascript file added to the iframe to send a postMessage back to the parent. However this isnt really much of a solution because for cross domain content you dont have them sort of privileges to go round adding javascript files to their servers.p  pAny one have any suggestions or alternative solutionsp
