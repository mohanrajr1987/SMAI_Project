Positive 469 pI am a beginner with access database. I am building a database for supplies. I have a form with a subform query. The query has checkboxes on it. When the user selects the checkbox they are choosing what supplies they need. They will press a request command button which will open a confirmation window that displays the items they chose another query. I would like for when they press the request button that the checkboxes clear on the subform query. I have tried several different ways of coding this with no luck. I dont know SQL very well and have been trying to do everything with VBA in the event codes. Can anyone help me out and point me in the right direction. p

Positive 469 pI need to read values from a MongoDB Collection and then check or not the checkboxes in a Meteor Template based on  a field in the Document which matches the value of a checkbox.p  pTo take a step back first, I populate the Template with the checkboxes like sop  precodeltdiv idseljoblocs nameseljoblocsgt   each jobLocs     ltinput typecheckbox valuejljoblocgtltlabelgtjljoblocltlabelgt   each ltdivgt codepre  p...populating the value and the label from the Templates jobLocs Helperp  precodejobLocs function    return JobLocations.find,      sort        jljobloc 1     ,     fields        jljobloc 1          codepre  pWhen a selection is made from a worker input select element, I can note which worker was selected like sop  precodeTemplate.matchWorkersWithJobLocs.events     change selworker functionevent, template          var workerid  template.findselworker.value          TODO Add code to query Collection and then check the appropriate checkboxes     , codepre  p...so that I can check the checkboxes where matches are found a match means that the worker is qualified to be assigned to the joblocation.

Negative 469 pIn my application, I receive a URLUTF8 encoded string of characters, which is split up by the sending client.

When all parts have been received, I simply recompose the message by concatenating each individual part according to header information.p  pWith languages that use 16bit encodings this is sometimes not working as expected. Everything works fine if the split does NOT happen in the middle of a single character.p  pFor instance heres a string of three Hebrew characters being sent by the clientp  pD793D799D791p  pIf this winds up split as follows D793D799 D791, reconstruction isnt a problem. p  pHowever sometimes the client splits it up in the middle example D793D7 99D791p  pWhen this happens, after reconstruction I get two  characters at the boundary point instead of the single correct Hebrew character.p  pI thought the inability to correctly retain the single byte information was related to passing around strings, so I tried passing around byte array from request.getParametercontent.getBytesUTF8 to the buffer without wrapping in the string joining together the byte arrays. In the buffer I joined all these arrays BEFORE converting the final array to a string.p  pEven after doing this, it appears I still lost that information held by the single bytes. Im guessing this is because the getBytesUTF8 method cant correctly resolve the single bytes since they are not valid characters. Is that rightp  pIs there any way I can get around this and preserve these tailhead bytesp

Negative 469 pI have a nonA2DP single ear BT headset Plantronics 510 and would like to use it with my Android HTC Magic to listen to low quality audio like podcastsaudio books.p  pAfter much googling I found that only phone call audio can be routed to the nonA2DP BT headsets. I would like to know if you have found a ready solution to route all kinds of audio to nonA2DP BT headsetsp  pSo I figured, somehow programmatically I can channel the audio to the stream that carries phone call audio. This way I will fool the phone to carry my mp3 audio to my BT headset. I wrote following simple code.p  precodeimport android.content. import android.app.Activity import android.os.Bundle import android.media. import java.io. import android.util.Log  public class BTAudioActivity extends Activity      private static final String TAG  BTAudioActivity      private MediaPlayer mPlayer  null     private AudioManager amanager  null      Override     public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState              super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.main          amanager  AudioManager getSystemServiceContext.AUDIOSERVICE         amanager.setBluetoothScoOntrue         amanager.setModeAudioManager.MODEINCALL          mPlayer  new MediaPlayer          try              mPlayer.setDataSourcenew FileInputStream                 sdcardsample.mp3.getFD              mPlayer.setAudioStreamTypeAudioManager.STREAMVOICECALL              mPlayer.prepare              mPlayer.start          catchException e              Log.eTAG, e.toString                    Override     public void onDestroy              mPlayer.stop         amanager.setModeAudioManager.MODENORMAL         amanager.setBluetoothScoOnfalse         super.onDestroy       codepre  pAs you can see I tried combinations of various methods that I thought will fool the phone to believe my audio is a phone callp  ul liUsing MediaPlayers setAudioStreamTypeSTREAMVOICECALLli liusing AudioManagers setBluetoothScoOntrueli liusing AudioManagers setModeMODEINCALLli ul  pBut none of the above worked. If I remove the AudioManager calls in the above code, the audio plays from speaker and if I replace them as shown above then the audio stops coming from speakers, but it doesnt come through the BT headset. So this might be a partial success.p  pI have checked that the BT headset works alright with phone calls.p  pThere must be a reason for Android not supporting this. But I cant let go of the feeling that it is not possible to programmatically reroute the audio.

Negative 469 pWe are a startup, with a few 14 clients using our products.  These products were developed in a strongclosed source web development framework only maintained by one developerstrong on the core.p  pBasically the framework server is strongrequiredstrong to be able to run any application built in it.  So there is no code, in our layer of the application.  Think of it as a CMS that allow us to develop in a proprietary language of the framework server itself.p  pThis framework is built on Java, and is closed source. It has a layer of plugins that need to use a proprietary IDE to build them.p  ul liThere is at this moment only 3 total developers in the company mother of this framework, one that is able to code on the framework itself, and 2 that are able to code on the IDE to build plugins.  We are the only company holding paying the salaries of 2 of the 3 developers, the 3rd is the owner.li liAt this moment we dont know if there is documentation for the framework level.li liWe know there is no documentation for the plugin layer.li ul  pThe ONLY reason keeping us developing in this framework is that we already have invested in it, and changing will cost us.p  pI am in the middle technology management, and I have been advising my IT DirectorPresident of some changes, but apparently I am not getting through.  I am advising to start developing new components in another framework ASP.NET MVC, Symfony, SPRING MVC with our own team of developers, and this components to integrate 100 with our old application, until we get comfortable to a point of porting the old applications from the old framework to the new one.p  pEither way there could be many variations of this plan.  Any advice from knowledge of SO.p  hr  pAs an alternate question emWhy would you build a business on a close web development framework that only has one developer and no documentationemp  hr  pstrongLast Commentstrong I think that probably Bruce is right.  My upper management team is more concern about continuing to sell and support our current product than to the risk that constituted continuing with it.  Probably when we grow from 14 clients to 30 clients they will see the lack of scalability that we own, and take some other actions but for now.  I think this battle is all done until 2011.

Negative 469 pIf this question seems common to you, I apologise, I did a quick search around this site and a few google searches and could not find a satisfying answer.p  pMy question is thisp  pI have only been a software developer for 34 years now.  This may seem like a time long enough to answer this question myself however in all my time, I have never had to develop software where the main body of datastorage is not required to be in an online database.  This time however, my latest development requires only for its data to be stored only to disk.p  pThe actual data itself is lightweight.  Incode the main asset will be a class with only a few, string based properties on it which must be persisted.  My initial thoughts are on simple serialisation.  On application close new assets are simply serialised and stored on disk as a file.  I also though maybe for backup purposes or if it is somehow a better option to a serialised class an XML file would be appropriate.p  pI cannot think of any distinct disadvantages of either of these approaches, it is this fact which causes me to ask this question publicly.  In my experience, there is rarely a solution to a problem which does not have its downsides.p  pThank you for your time.p

Negative 469 pIt feels like codehtmlsafecode adds an abstraction to the String class that requires understanding of what is going on, for example,p  precodelt 1 ltbgt2ltbgt gt       gives 1 ampltbampgt2ampltbampgt in the HTML source code  lt h 1 ltbgt2ltbgt gt     exactly the same as above  lt 1 ltbgt2ltbgt.htmlsafe gt        1 ltbgt2ltbgt  in HTML source code  lt h 1 ltbgt2ltbgt.htmlsafe gt      exactly the same as above  lt h h 1 ltbgt2ltbgt gt    1 ampltbampgt2ampltbampgt   wont escape twice codepre  pFor line 4, if we are saying, ok, we trust the string  it is safe, but why cant we escape it  It seems that to escape it by codehcode, the string has to be unsafe.p  pSo on line 1, if the string is not escaped by codehcode, it will be automatically escaped.  On line 5, codehcode cannot escape the string twice  in other words, after codeltcode is changed to codeampltcode, it cant escape it one more time to codeampampltcode.p  pSo whats happening  At first, I thought codehtmlsafecode is just tagging a flag to the string, saying it is safe.  So then, why does codehcode not escape it  It seems that codehcode and codehtmlescapecode actually cooperate on using the flagp  p1 If a string is htmlsafe, then codehcode will not escape itp  p2 If a string is not htmlsafe, then when the string is added to the output buffer, it will be automatically escaped by codehcode.p  p3 If codehcode already escaped a string, it is marked codehtmlsafecode, and therefore, escaping it one more time by codehcode wont take any effect. as on Line 5, and that behavior is the same even in Rails 2.3.10, but on Rails 2.3.5 codehcode can actually escape it twice... so in Rails 2.3.5, codehcode is a simple escape method, but some where along the line to 2.3.10, codehcode became not as simple.  But 2.3.10 wont auto escape a string, but for some reason, the method codehtmlsafecode already exists for 2.3.10 for what purposep  pIs that how it works exactly  I think nowadays, sometimes we dont get what we want in the output and we immediately add codehtmlsafecode to our variable, which can be quite dangerous, because it can introduce XSS attack that way, so understanding how it exactly works can be quite important.  The above is only a guess of how it exactly work.  Could it be actually a different mechanism and is there any doc that supports itp

Negative 469 pIm a relative newcomer to cocoa amp programming for the ipad.p  pIve built an app that has a split view controller. In the detail view is a toolbar with a button on it. When the button is pressed, the split view controller is removed from the superview, and another view is put in its place. A toolbar button on this new view removes the view and puts the split view back. Works great... except when the ipad is rotated while the second view is visible. When the user returns to the split view, its displayed as it was before the rotation. p  pThe split view and all the sub views are set to autoresizeyes, and return yes when they receive the autorotatetointerfaceorientation message.p  pIm guessing I need to tell the split view and its sub views to resize themselves when I add it as a subview to the window.p  pThanks Chrisp

Negative 469 pWe are using a custom principal and identity type ProdigyPrincipalProdigyIdentity because we need extra information within our programs and services. In the program we set the principal and identity. When communicating with a WCF service the principal and identity are set, but after casting to our own type the principal and identity are null. p  pI noticed that there is a difference between running in Debug mode and Unit Test mode.

Negative 469 pI am building a game engine in C, and my goal is to be able to dynamically edit and reload component classes that are also written in C. From what Ive discovered via a few different examples, it is indeed possible to load an assembly DLL into an AppDomain, then unload it and reload an editedrecompiled version it its place. Through my own testing Ive found that it works quite well, the only problem left is eliminating all the runtime references to a particular instance of that object so that it can be reloaded and replaced.p  pBasically, I would like to be able to get a list of all references to a particular object. I am aware that this may be entirely impossible in C, as it depends heavily on the language storing a list of all objects referencing a particular object. It does not matter if the implementation is incredibly slow, so long as it works properly.p  pIve pasted some pseudocode here for what I want to be able to do a hrefhttpnopaste.dkp3059 relnofollowhttpnopaste.dkp3059ap  pI know one way I could do this is to have my own weak reference type that I basically use everywhere, and never create direct references to an object. This seems like a bit of a headache, but at least unloading the AppDomain would throw an exception if any true references to the object still existed. Basically this puts the management into my hands, instead of being automatic and enforceable.p  pIf you know a good way to do this, or you think Im doing something fundamentally wrong, feel free to speak up, and thanksp
Negative 469 pIve got a python crawler crawling a few webpages every few minutes. Im now trying to implement a user interface to be accessed over the web and to display the data obtained by the crawler. Im going to use phphtml for the interface. Anyway, the user interface needs some sort of button which triggers the crawler to crawl a specific website straight away and not wait for the next crawl iteration.p  pNow, is there a way of sending data from the php script to the running python script I was thinking about standard inputoutput, but could not find a way this can be done writing from one process to another process stdin. Then I was thinking about using a shared file which php writes into and python reads from. But then I would need some way to let the python script know, that new data has been written to the file and a way to let the php script know when the crawler has finished its task. Another way would be sockets  but then I think, this would be a bit over the top and not as simple as possible.p  pDo you have any suggestions to keep everything as simple as possible but still allowing me to send data from a php script to a running python processp  pThanks in advance for any ideasp  pEdit I should note, that the crawler saves the obtained data into a sql database, which php can access. So passing data from the python crawler to the php script is no problem. Its the other way round.p

Negative 469 pIm working on a legacy project that has heavy use of Singletons. While most of them would be better implemented otherwise, for now the goal is to get them under test.

Negative 469 pAs an exercise, I have been trying to build a nonGUI boggle type game in python. So far, the user is able to enter a board size 4x4,5x5,etc.  The array of letters appears and then the user may type in a word that they think is a valid option.  p  pI wanted to check if the entered word was valid by using a recursive function.  On small boards my solution seems to work fine. On larger boards however, words with similar starts and multiple paths dont register.

Negative 469 pWere writing a simple .NET C COM applicaton for Photoshop, which is designed to run on all versions from CS2 to CS5 and everything in between. The same application also exists in JavaScript form and it works with all aforementioned versions, as weve avoided to implement version specific functionality.p  pThe problem weve run into is related to the COM interface. For instance, if our application is compiled with the Interop.Photoshop DLL from Photoshop CSx, it does not run on Photoshop CSy. This seems to be because the registry CLSID is specific to each version of Photoshop, causing our application to not find the correct COM interface DLL, if run on a system where a different version of Photoshop than what we compiled for is installed assuming both applications are 32 bit.p  pIf this is indeed the problem, we are wondering if it would be possible to reregister the COM interface of Photoshop version CSx with the CSy CLSID, ignoring the fact that functionality may differ between versions.p  pMore specific information followp  pOur primary Photoshop.Application CLSID is located here in the registry HKEYCLASSESROOTPhotoshop.ApplicationCLSID This CLSID must match the CLSID for which our application was built for. For instance, this ID differs between CS5 and CS5.1.p  pOur only solution today is to build specific versions of our application for specific versions of Photoshop, and this is only possible if we have that specific application version installed.p  pThe error code we are getting is 0x80040154, Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID 116EE066135E4F638D0E78F62705FBFC failed. This application was built with CS5.1 but run on CS5.04 which resulted in the COM interface to not be found. This CLSID is specific to CS5.1. In conclusion, we need to reregister the COM interface to match the CLSID of CS5.04 to be able to run our application on that specific version. Is this possible or is there another wayp  pAny help or hint we can get on the matter is extremely appreciated. p

Negative 469 pWe are building a web page with hashtag navigation. There is lots of data, which comes in as JSON and we use clientside templates jQuery to render it. So what are the options for reusable templates on both clientside and serverside Ruby on rails Because we would like to have an option to fallback to a nonhashtag url and in this case server should render the data.p  pIve seen Mustache.js, but it has poor support for iterating cant get index or nested templates and hamljs is not an option because it uses custom tags for loops.p  pThere are also couple of workarounds with using javascript engine on server side, but Im not sure this will be a good decision.p  pAny suggetions Thanks.p

Negative 469 pSo I just wrote an absolutely superb, perfectly welldesigned iPhone app thats going to make so rich, Ill be awash in pontoon boats and swimsuit models and helicopters. I want to make even more cash by converting it to a universal app for both iPad and iPhone.p  pNow that Im doing that, and being the lazy programmer I am, trying to maximize reuse of code Ive already written, Im finding I can reuse most of it  certainly all of the model  but theres always some little thing that I have to modify on a controller class. Or, theres constant checks on codeUIUSERINTERFACEIDIOMcode which seems like a code smell to me.p  pAt the same time, I think the iPad version should not be the iPhone version writ large. A different UI is certainly warranted to most cases, but there will be spots where you want to reuse a dialog, or a whole view hierarchy.p  pSo, I ask the community. What are some good practices to follow to ensure that my app can be universal with minimal tweaksp

Negative 469 pI have searched around a lot for a solution, but could not find any. I have a server application in .NET that receives video streams from multiple devices. The library that I am using to decode and process the stream is not threadsafe. The name of my library is VideoProcessor with a VideoProcessor class.p  pIn my main program, I would like to create an instance of VideoProcessor for each device. My first approach was to have a connection event handler that instantiates VideoProcessor for the new device. However, it would never work when more than one device tries to connect. Please refer to the code snippet belowp  precode static void HandleVideoConnectionEventint port, string deviceId           VideoProcessor vid  new VideoProcessorport, deviceId     codepre  pAs you can see, I will overwrite vid everytime a new device connects. I have run out of ideas. I need to have a separate instance of VideoProcessor running for each device and I have to keep track of which instance is being used for  which device. My last hope is to spawn a new process for a new device connection and maintain a list of deviceIDs and their corresponding PID I dont know if this is possible in .NET. Please help. There must be a neat way of doing this. Thank you very much in advance for your time.p  pRegards.p

Negative 469 pIm currently trying to download an Apache Maven plugin for Eclipse so I can migrate a project from Ant. Ive read numerous tutorial sites on how to install this plugin, and most of them offer an update site. Unfortunately, my Eclipse is not finding any of the repositories that are supposedly at the URLs Ive been given. Here are some of the ones Ive triedp  precodehttpm2eclipse.sonatype.orgsitesm2e httpdownload.eclipse.orgtechnologym2ereleases httpmevenide.codehaus.orgmaveneclipsepluginplugin codepre  pSadly, all of these havent proven useful yet, so Im starting to think that perhaps a certain setting is off or missing within Eclipse itself that is preventing it from finding these repositories. Sometimes, though, it tells me that it is simply unable to read a repository. For example, Eclipse spat out this error a few times when trying to use a hrefhttpm2eclipse.sonatype.orgsitesm2ehttpm2eclipse.sonatype.orgsitesm2eap  precodeUnable to read repository at httpm2eclipse.sonatype.orgsitesm2econtent.xml. codepre  pWhen this happens, it seems as though its finding the repository, but it just cant read it... As Ive said, Ive followed a handful of instructions to downloading the plugin, and none have worked thanks to this initial step. Any ideasp

Negative 469 pIn Flex 3, I used to be able to take 2 panels, lay them out with 100 width settings in an HBox.  If I changed the width property of the first panel to something smaller, lets say 20, the second would automatically update and fill in the space that used to be taken up by the first as the first resized down.p  pI notice in spark, this doesnt happen.  I have an app with a HorizontalLayout, and a resizable panel control on the left and a panel on the right that has width100.  When I resize my leftside panel down, the right side panel doesnt do anything.  So I end up with a clean resizable panel, a bunch of wasted space, and my rightside panel just sitting there.p  pWhat I expect is that since the rightside panel has a width100 then if the panel to its left is resized, then there would be a corresponding growth in the rightside panel to fill in.p  pIve tried to manually trigger validation on properties and size without effect.

I would think that since a HorizontalLayout is being used, that both children would update when the width of one of them was changed.  But that just doesnt seem to be the case.  I know I can create two states to accomplish this, but I was thinking that I shouldnt have to for something so trivial.p

Negative 469 pI am working on an application that lets the user install a new language to his OS X spelling. In this application I also want the user to be able to test the new language added by entering some text into a NSTextField.p  pThe user changes the spelling language through the system preferences app, as normal. My problem is that the NSTextField component does not change the spelling language it is using when the user changes it in the preferences app. I have to quit my application and relaunch it for it to change spelling language.p  pI have tried releasing the NSTextField, and allocating it again after the language change is done, but that makes no difference.p  pSo I hope that someone could point me to how I refresh the language used for spell check within NSTextField runtimep

Negative 469 pIve worked on a program that uses databases to send small messages from one PC to another. What Ive done is put the database in a shared folder, have the program on the other PC connect to it via a Path, no less, and there it is, a simple and easy way to get messages to and fro PCs on a network. Not the best option, but its just homework, and the quick and dirty approach got me a grade.p  pBut now the homework is done, and Id like to improve upon what I did. The problem with the program is in the deployment stage. There are too many folders  installation paths and administrative  sharing issues regarding pathing directly to a database on a shared folder.p  pSo the good folks here in stackoverflow advised me to try Socket Programming, which I think is a bit out of my league. But you never know...p  pAlso, Im aware of the difference between Sync and Async socket programming. One blocks, the other doesnt. The program Im working on is a simple turnbased game, so I thought Synchronous might be good enough, since if its not your turn, you really cant do anything. The issue however is that the program is treated as not responding. I tried asynchronous, but ran into problems with threading, something I consider WAY out of my league.p  pLogically, the program is simple. One host, one client. Upon client connection, host sends data. Then client receives, send out its own data. And so on, until one player loses.p  pIm sorry to say only .NET 2.0 is installed in my school. No WCF or anything. Also, it must be done in C Windows Forms, so XNA is out.p  pSo, Id like to ask... is there an easy way to get into Socket Programming Any guides  sample projects that can help Premade codes that can be studied, and adaptedp  pMajority of the samples I found and adapted are chat applications, which I thought good enough, but making it modular simply breaks it.p

It will result in RAY originating from point P2 and passing thru point P3.

And if it is 0, the points are on the same imaginary line extending from P1.p  pI am sure that they are using some Vector Mathematics to find the direction.p  pCan someone please help me how to arrive to this solutionp

Negative 469 pI used a hrefhttpwww.eclipsecolorthemes.org relnofollowhttpwww.eclipsecolorthemes.orga to set up syntax coloring in Eclipse.  My standard palette is dark on light, but selected text is inverted light on dark.  The problem is that Eclipse uses my selection background color but keeps the regular foreground color, so I wind up with an unreadable darkondark.p  pGenerally this is on code, so my foreground colors are coming from the syntaxbased colors, but I tried this on a plain text file that uses the basic colors from the General  Editors  Text Editors preference.  Normal text is Foreground color on Background color and selected text is Foreground color on Selection background color  it seems to ignore Selection foreground color entirely.p  pThis is Eclipse Indigo on OS X.

Assume that we keep codefoocode sometimes by value and only want to pay the price of the reference counter when we have a pointer. For example, sometimes we would like to create codefoocode instances and just move them around, and sometimes we want to allocate codefoocode on the heap. p  pConceptually, the right mechanism for this scenario is a codestdsharedptrcode. However, there are certain scenarios requiring raw pointers that would call for an intrusive pointer, e.g., when passing pointers through a C API that take void pointers. In this case, one would ref the pointer before passing it to the opaque API and unref when getting it back.p  pHaving control over codefoocode, probably the best method would be to use a policybased implementation and have a referencecounted and basic version of codefoocode.

If we create a strongbranchstrong from the old strongtagstrong how do we cleanly get the patch fixes into our strongtrunkstrong and also mark the new patch release with a new strongtagstrongp  pCan I strongtagstrong the strongbranchstrong created from the initial strongrelease tagstrong and strongreintegrate mergestrong the strongbranchstrong with our strongtrunkstrong Or will that pose a problem I feel it might confuse Subversion.p  pThis picture tries to illustrate the flow.p  precodeWork branches  itter. 1.0        2.0             3.0                                                                                  trunk                                                      v2.0 tag                     v3.0 tag                                                                                                                V1.0 tag                                                                           Branch 1.1                                                                                                                                                    V1.1 tag codepre  pNote that even though tags and branches are on the same lines here they actually reside in the standard strongtrunk, branches, tagsstrong folder layout.p  pNote the work branches does NOT have to have anything to do with a given release.

Negative 469 pI want to upgrade and make more systematic, my protection against sql injection attacks.

Negative 469 pSo, I have a SQL Server located on a local host machine and a MySQL server located on a cloud server. Due to the way the application I am working on is integrated in the office, I have to be able to upload data from the local SQL Server to the remote MySQL server in order to keep all the data between the two fairly concurrent. My objective is to write a small script that will execute daily on the local server and update all database records on the remote server.p  pI am using ODBC to connect to the MySQL server while in SQL Server Management Studio. During the test phase, I am able to do select statements on the remote server without issue, for instance the following sqlp  precodeSELECT  FROM OPENQUERYMYSQLSRV, SELECT emid, model, disp, del FROM engine codepre  pThis query executes flawlessly. However, when I attempt to insert a new record into the remote  db, like thisp  precodeINSERT OPENQUERY MYSQLSRV,  SELECT emid, model, disp, del FROM engine VALUES 2,JLCTEST,1,1 codepre  pI get the following errorp  precodeOLE DB provider MSDASQL for linked server  MYSQLSRV returned message [MySQL][ODBC 5.1 Driver][mysqld5.1.61log] Binary logging not possible.

Msg 7343, Level 16, State 2, Line 1 The OLE DB provider MSDASQL for linked server MYSQLSRV could not INSERT INTO table [MSDASQL]. codepre  pI thought that maybe this was caused because I was not explicitly inserting an id for the insert, so I adjusted my query as followsp  precodeINSERT OPENQUERY MYSQLSRV,  SELECT id, emid, model, disp, del FROM engine VALUES null, 2,JLCTEST,1,1 codepre  pUnfortunately, this also does not work and gives me this errorp  precodeThe OLE DB provider MSDASQL for linked server MYSQLSRV could not  INSERT INTO table [MSDASQL] because of column id.  The data value violated the integrity constraints for the column. codepre  pI have done some research on this subject, but most of them are saying that I need to set the global binlogformat variable to MIXED. Some have stated that I can do this on a session or transaction level, but my remote MySQL server is a cloud solution and is on a shared server instance, so I do not have SUPER permissions in order to make these changes. Additionally, the transaction and session level also require SUPER permissions due to the server configuration which cannot be changed according to my provider.p  pIs there something I am completely missing when attempting to do this Amy I going to be relegated to writing a separate script that will pull from one, store the information, and then post it to the other through some form of cron jobp  h1EDITh1  pIve found a solution based on changing my tables from InnoDB to MyISAM.

I dont know that this is necessarily the best solution to the problem, especially if they change this behavior in the future.p

Negative 469 pPlease excuse me this question, but I cant find any solution through my research so far. At least nothing that helped me p  pstrongMy Situationstrong p  ul liI am using hibernate for a vaadin webservice li liThe webservice is taking uploaded documents and puts them unchanged via hibernate in my MySQL databaseli liA compute service in the background a seperate process that later might be on another server does computation tasks on the uploaded documents and adds the results again in the databaseli liThe webservice recognizes the analysis results in the database and shows them to the userli ul  pstrongMy Problemstrong p  ul liMy problem is the level 1 hibernate cacheli liAfter the compute service has been started he doesnt compute anything on later updated documents, since they dont appear in his cache when he fulfills the given searchquery. li liMy webservice overwrites made changes in the compute server, since it doesnt know anything about it as well. li ul  pI know that the hibernate level 1 cache is responsible for this behavior lvl 2 cache is not active by the way.p  pstrongWhat I have tried so farstrongp  ul lipIve read a lot and tried several things, for example calling session.clear on various places. This often gave me session is closed exceptions and didnt help me although I read about people mentioning that this helped with their problems pli lipI tried to make sure that the session is closed always in the end, but this didnt solve the problem, as well as I read that I dont need to close the sessions manually anyways, after I used transaction.commit I heard this is the standard in the session per request pattern pli lipI tried closing my sessionfactory and reopening it every time my compute service needs to search the database. This works partially and probably full if I also do this on my web service, but this doesnt seem to be a very good solution to me also memory consuming, not pli lipI tried adding pli ul  blockquote   plt property namehibernate.connection.isolation2lt  propertyp blockquote  pto my hibernate.cfg.xml, but this also worked only partially. Using this my compute service did computation tasks, but his changes got again overwritten everytime new data gets uploaded through the web service. So new uploads have been detected, but once a new upload has been arrived, all already analyzed documents get analyzed again. p  ul liI read about a Query method called setForceCacheRefreshboolean forceCacheRefresh e.g. from here a hrefhttpwww.dil.univmrs.frmassatdocshibernate2apinetsfhibernateQuery.htmlsetForceCacheRefresh28boolean29 relnofollowhttpwww.dil.univmrs.frmassatdocshibernate2apinetsfhibernateQuery.htmlsetForceCacheRefresh28boolean29a, but somehow I cant find this method in my hibernate version. Sad though, the description sounded goodli ul  pI was always thinking about if the way I manage sessions is incorrect. My class DAO has two methods, which get called at every beginning and every end of a transaction. p  precodepublic abstract class DAO      Returns the current hibernate session.

I read that Optimistic Locking will only throw an exception if the cache object isnt the one in the database. But does it also load refresh the cache then p  pHow did you handle this problem in your hibernate Do you have any suggestions what I could do or did I even do something wrong in my DAOclass Im also happy about code examples. Again I want that every process knows about changes made in the database by the other one. Id even disable the first cache, if I could, but since this isnt possible p  pstrongThanks a lot for every answer and thought youre sharing with mestrongp

Negative 469 pI am very new to this world of web services. And I am currently exploring Apache CXF based JAXRS web services. Well while talking to some of my seniors who has a pretty good idea of web services, he told me that t is always a good practice to expose an interface as a web service rather than the implementation class. But I dont think I fully understand the benefits of such a approach. Can someone explain me why should a interface based approach be better than a normal approachp  pAlso, Can someone point me to a link which can show me how a interface based jaxrs web service is built from scratch rather than just changing a existing one to an interface form.p
Negative 469 pBeen working on this annoying son of a gun for 3 days. Hoping someone will be able to offer some assistance. Basically Im using a hrefhttptutorialzine.com201109html5fileuploadjqueryphp relnofollowhttptutorialzine.com201109html5fileuploadjqueryphpa to allow multiple file uploads along side with a regular file upload input. The first part of this code is the copying of the original image that was uploaded. That works fine for both.

Negative 469 pI am working on a ColdFusion 8 training application where Im making some AJAX requests without any libraries such as jQuery to support a very basic CRUD application.   The high level architecture includes a CFM view, a CFC with remote access methods which receive the AJAX requests, and a CFC which acts as a model and has all of the database queries.   For just retrieving data that doesnt require any sort of bind variables like getting all rows from the table, the AJAX queries are working fine.  When I try to post anything to the CFC middle layer, however, Im getting errors about the values Im looking for being undefined in the Form scope which from my understanding is where post parameters will be stored.  I even dissected the requests with Tamper Data and verified that the names and values of the post parameters are as I expect them to be.p  pHere is an example of the JS AJAX requestsp  precode    function addLocationlocToAdd              var thisAccess  new AccessStructPOST, jsontest.cfcmethodaddNewLocation, getLocations, newLoc  JSON.stringifylocToAdd             accessWrapperaddLoc, thisAccess      function accessWrapperaction, accessDef              var ajaxRequest  new XMLHttpRequest             var nextStep             if action  getLocs                  nextStep  getLocations              else                  nextStep  buildTable                           ajaxRequest.onreadystatechange  function   using a closure so that the callback can                 if ajaxRequest.readyState  4            examine the request and nextStep                     if ajaxRequest.status  200                          if nextStep  null                              nextStepajaxRequest                                                  return true                      else                          alertRequest Could Not Be Completed Errors On Page                         return false                                                                ajaxRequest.openaccessDef.method, accessDef.url, true             ajaxRequest.sendnewLoc  accessDef.params            function LoclocCode, parLocCode, name, addrL1, addrL2,                             city, stateProv, postal, locTypeCode              this.locCode      locCode             this.parLocCode   parLocCode             this.name         name             this.addrL1       addrL1             this.addrL2       addrL2             this.city         city             this.stateProv    stateProv             this.postal       postal             this.locTypeCode  locTypeCode                   function AccessStructmethod, url, nextStep, params              this.method    method             this.url       url             this.nextStep  nextStep             this.params    params          codepre  pEssentially whats happening on the page is that a table populated by all the location loc records is being rendered for a user.  There is a form to add a new user, and when they click the add button, a Loc structure is created containing the information they entered and is passed to the addLocation function.  This creates an Access structure, which will include the request URL, method, the name of a function to act as a callback, and any post parameters.  This is all passed into the accessWrapper function, which will create the XMLHttpRequest and process the AJAX request.  I used a closure for the onreadystatechange callback function so that it could be aware of the XMLHttpRequest object and the callback function defined in the Access structure this callback function will be generally be used to refresh the view table after a record is added, deleted, or edited. p  pHere is the cffunction within the middlelayer CFC where the problem is being reported from.  I wont bother to post the DAO CFC as that has been tested elsewhere and is not even being reached during this process because its failing at the middle [or controller] levelp  precode ltcffunction nameaddNewLocation outputfalse accessremotegt     ltcfset var deserializedLocation  gt     ltcfscriptgt         deserializedLocation  DeserializeJSONForm.newLoc     ltcfscriptgt      ltcfobject componentlocationDAO namelocationDAOObjgt     ltcfinvoke         componentlocationDAOObj         methodaddLocationgt         ltcfinvokeargument namecode valuedeserializedLocation.locCodegt         ltcfinvokeargument nameparentCode valuedeserializedLocation.parLocCodegt         ltcfinvokeargument namename valuedeserializedLocation.namegt         ltcfinvokeargument nameaddr1 valuedeserializedLocation.addrL1gt         ltcfinvokeargument nameaddr2 valuedeserializedLocation.addrL2gt         ltcfinvokeargument namecity valuedeserializedLocation.citygt         ltcfinvokeargument namestateProv valuedeserializedLocation.stateProvgt         ltcfinvokeargument namepostal valuedeserializedLocation.postalgt         ltcfinvokeargument namelocationType valuedeserializedLocation.locTypeCodegt     ltcfinvokegt ltcffunctiongt codepre  pThe error in the request response is      500 Element NEWLOC is undefined in FORMp  pLike I said before, Ive checked the request in Tamper Data, and it looks fine there.

The Code I need to modify is in default.phtml but when i do that and set it to display that it stops displaying the other half of the page or the view.phtml part.p  pI am using .... p  precodeltreference nameproduct.infogt ltaction methodsetTemplategt               lttemplategtcatalogproductviewtypedefault1.phtmllttemplategtltactiongt ltreferencegt codepre  p...in the custom layout section of the product in the backend. But this only shows the sizing section of the page and not the namedescriptionpicture witch is output by view.phtmlp  pSo how do I get view.phtml to display the new default1.phtmlp  pand if I try..... p  precodeltreference nameproduct.infogt ltaction methodsetTemplategt  lttemplategtcatalogproductview.phtmllttemplategt ltactiongt ltreferencegt codepre  pit works but does not show default1.phtml in the size section. All this because I need to show 2 different size charts one for males and one for females. You can see my issue by going to mysteryhousecostumes.net and navigating to a womans product and then a mans and you will see the mens products still link to the womens size chart.p  pHow do I fix view.phtml so that it links to default1 instead of default I realize Ill need to make a duplicate view.phtml but I cant find the connection between the two files here is my view.phtml p  precodeltphp helper  thisgthelpercatalogoutput gt ltphp product  thisgtgetProduct gt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt var optionsPrice  new Product.OptionsPriceltphp echo thisgtgetJsonConfig gt ltscriptgt ltdiv idmessagesproductviewgtltphp echo thisgtgetMessagesBlockgtgetGroupedHtml gt    ltdivgt ltdiv classproductviewgt ltdiv classproductessentialgt ltform actionltphp echo thisgtgetSubmitUrlproduct gt methodpost idproductaddtocartformltphp ifproductgtgetOptions gt enctypemultipartformdataltphp endif gtgt     ltdiv classnodisplaygt         ltinput typehidden nameproduct valueltphp echo productgtgetId gt gt         ltinput typehidden namerelatedproduct idrelatedproductsfield value gt     ltdivgt      ltdiv classproductshopgt         ltdiv classproductnamegt             lth1gtltphp echo helpergtproductAttributeproduct, productgtgetName, name gtlth1gt         ltdivgt          ltphp if thisgtcanEmailToFriend gt             ltp classemailfriendgtlta hrefltphp echo thisgthelpercatalogproductgtgetEmailToFriendUrlproduct gtgtltphp echo thisgtEmail to a Friend gtltagtltpgt         ltphp endif gt          ltphp echo thisgtgetReviewsSummaryHtmlproduct, false, truegt         ltphp echo thisgtgetChildHtmlalerturls gt         ltphp echo thisgtgetChildHtmlproducttypedata gt         ltphp echo thisgtgetTierPriceHtml gt         ltphp echo thisgtgetChildHtmlextrahint gt          ltphp if thisgthasOptionsgt             ltdiv classaddtoboxgt                 ltphp ifproductgtisSaleable gt                     ltphp echo thisgtgetChildHtmladdtocart gt                     ltphp if thisgthelperwishlistgtisAllow  compareUrlthisgthelpercatalogproductcomparegtgetAddUrlproduct gt                         ltspan classorgtltphp echo thisgtOR gtltspangt                     ltphp endif gt                 ltphp endif gt                 ltphp echo thisgtgetChildHtmladdto gt             ltdivgt             ltphp echo thisgtgetChildHtmlextrabuttons gt         ltphp endif gt          ltphp if productgtgetShortDescriptiongt             ltdiv classshortdescriptiongt                 lth2gtltphp echo thisgtQuick Overview gtlth2gt                 ltdiv classstdgtltphp echo helpergtproductAttributeproduct, nl2brproductgtgetShortDescription, shortdescription gtltdivgt             ltdivgt         ltphp endifgt          ltphp echo thisgtgetChildHtmlothergt          ltphp if productgtisSaleable ampamp thisgthasOptionsgt             ltphp echo thisgtgetChildChildHtmlcontainer1, , true, true gt         ltphp endifgt      ltdivgt      ltdiv classproductimgboxgt         ltphp echo thisgtgetChildHtmlmedia gt     ltdivgt      ltdiv classclearergtltdivgt     ltphp if productgtisSaleable ampamp thisgthasOptionsgt         ltphp echo thisgtgetChildChildHtmlcontainer2, , true, true gt     ltphp endifgt ltformgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgt lt[CDATA[     var productAddToCartForm  new VarienFormproductaddtocartform     productAddToCartForm.submit  functionbutton, url          if this.validator.validate              var form  this.form             var oldUrl  form.action              if url                 form.action  url                          var e  null             try                  this.form.submit              catch e                           this.form.action  oldUrl             if e                  throw e                           if button ampamp button  undefined                  button.disabled  true                           .bindproductAddToCartForm      productAddToCartForm.submitLight  functionbutton, url         ifthis.validator              var nv  Validation.methods             delete Validation.methods[requiredentry]             delete Validation.methods[validateonerequired]             delete Validation.methods[validateonerequiredbyname]             if this.validator.validate                  if url                      this.form.action  url                                  this.form.submit                          Object.extendValidation.methods, nv              .bindproductAddToCartForm ]]gt ltscriptgt ltdivgt  ltdiv classproductcollateralgt ltphp foreach thisgtgetChildGroupdetailedinfo, getChildHtml as alias gt htmlgt     ltdiv classboxcollateral ltphp echo boxaliasgtgt         ltphp if title  thisgtgetChildDataalias, titlegt         lth2gtltphp echo thisgtescapeHtmltitle gtlth2gt         ltphp endifgt         ltphp echo html gt     ltdivgt ltphp endforeachgt     ltphp echo thisgtgetChildHtmlupsellproducts gt     ltphp echo thisgtgetChildHtmlproductadditionaldata gt ltdivgt codepre  pp

Negative 469 pfirst time asking a question in here but I have found answers in the website so many times before. p  pMy question is why this code is not working in IE, works perfectly in Chrome. I read the other topic similar to this one, but the answer there is to replace the toggle with if .show .hide. Thats not what I want to do, I want to use toggle and I just dont seem to understand why IE doesnt like it. This works a bit like a menu and its a list of services a company offers and the toggle is a div with details about the service. I know that div tags are ok in li tags so it shouldnt be that, the reason I am using divs is because I am using a lot of CSS to style it, although it could be done in a smarter and cleaner way...  I know there are very similar questions to this, but I couldnt find the answer why my code isnt working in IE9.

Just redundancy and speed. There will be a lot more reads than writes.p  pWhat is the best way to implement this Would a folder on disk be the best way How would one get that to span across many servers with redundancyp  pEDITbr The original problembr We have a big amount of objects with up to something like 50 tags. Guessing an average of 10 tags.  The client will send a list of tags to the server. The server should return a list of all objects that contains all or almost all tags sent by the user.p  pMy approach so farbr  1. Get a list of all possible tags in somewhat order of appearence most used first. Lets call this codetaglistcode.br  2. Sort list from client by codetaglistcode.br  3. Use following algorithmp  precodealgorithm startFolder    for each object in startFolder        stack.push object    for each folder in startFolder where folder.name is in listSentByClient        algorithm folder     codepre  p4. codestackcode now contains all objects which contains all tags sent by client.   5. Return the stack to the clientp  pWhen adding new objectsbr  1. Sort tags by codetaglistcode. Call this codesortedlistcodebr  2. Enter or create folder where name  first tag in codesortedlistcode   3. Remove first tag in codesortedlistcodebr  4. Repeat step 2 and 3 until no tags are leftbr  5. Create object in current location  p  pIf this approach is wrong or you know a better one  please tell.p

Negative 469 pI am trying to embed C as a scripting langague to my C library. I was aware that this might be not a trivial task so I went for a minimal test project to see if this is even possible first. p  pI have managed to create a C assembly containing code for managing simple scripts and compiling them  runtime using codeCSharpCodeProvidercode. The assembly was tested using C console app as a test project given C source files are compiled in memory and executed when necessary.p  pSo the next step was to bridge this with a C application.p  pI have somehow managed to do that using COM. I exported my C dll, the classes and interfaces, as COM objects and generated the tlb file using Regasm.p  pI am able to create instances of these classes in C project and call their methods and everything seemed to work fine for example displaying codeWindows.Formscode message box until the actual logic needed to be executed. It just throws exceptions that should not be thrown as It already worked with a C console app as a host of the library.p  pAs I dont know if I can debug COM components well stepping into the code of this C dll is not possible AFAIK so I added plethora of message boxes and trycatch blocks. p  pIt seems that it breaks when I try to retrieve any type from compiled assembly. It throws codeReflection.ReflectionTypeLoadExceptioncodep  pThe compiling on the other hand does not fail nor generate any error messages. p  pUsing C to trigger these methods works 100, only while executing from C it does break somehow.p  pWhat might be the cause of this Or possibly is there another way of doing what I am trying to do I do find COM somehow right to be used in such scenario but are there aspects that I am not aware of that cause such code to breakp  pstrongEDITstrong This is the managed C assembly exported as COM a hrefhttpnopaste.info9da70dbcbd.html relnofollowhttpnopaste.info9da70dbcbd.htmlap  pSo these objects are accessed from C app like so a hrefhttpnopaste.info50c4c9726a.html relnofollowhttpnopaste.info50c4c9726a.htmlap  pAnd the script is as simple as class deriving from codeIScriptcode and implementing codeExecutecode method which displays message box.p  pstrongEdit 2strongp  pThe details regarding the exception thrown is the following Could not load file or assembly lame2.scripting, Version1.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyToken84d0df983ded76a1 or one of its dependencies. Nie mona odnale okrelonego pliku.p  pThe last sentence means that the File could not be found. p  pBut it is strange since when compiling I have the following line compilerparams.ReferencedAssemblies.AddDInteroplame2.scriptinglame2.scriptingbinDebug  lame2.scripting.dllp  pThis is the script contentsp  precodeusing System using System.Linq using System.Windows.Forms using System.Reflection using lame2.scripting  namespace Olaboga    public class TestScript  IScript        public TestScript        public void ExecuteEvent ev            MessageBox.ShowScript that has been compiled from a source file has been invoked.   TestScript.Execute          codepre  pEdit 3p  pFinally after switch from compilation in memory to compilation to temporary file it suddenly started to work properly. So the last question can someone knows why it failed to work while being compiled in memory and if is it possible to do so.p

Negative 469 pI have a very strait forward question and yes Ive looked though apple documentation to see if this has an answer but no luck... I may have accidentally missed it thoughp  pHeres my planp  pThe problem Ive been trying to find a workaround for is that if the admin would ever want to add a product, he would have to log into iTunes connect to add it and also add it in a custom control panel. We, obviously, dont want to make him suffer that so Ive been looking for a solution but I need you guys to tell me if its allowed by apple. Basically I will take over most of the product handling on our servers and will only go to apple with the transactions. This means that apple will not have an inapp purchase set up for ALL the products... only one for each length of subscription 1 month, 3 month... etc and a few consumable inapp purchases for the various prices of the issuessinglesp  pSide note I will be selling monthly issues that contain multiple singles for each day of the month. The user will be able to download a full month or a single day at a time if they like. p  pDEFINITION OF CONSUMABLE PURCHASE  products must be purchased each time the user needs that item. For example, onetime services are commonly implemented as consumable products.p  pSo I will store all the information in our server about the products and if someone chooses to buy a single months issue that was set to 4.99 on our server, not apples then the app will run the inapp purchase with apple that is listed for the 4.99 tier. Whenever a person opens the app for the first time, their app will send some information to our server and they will have a row set aside for them where all the information about their purchases will be recorded so that they can restore them if they switch over to another device. p  pIf you guys think im safe in doing this, please let me know so that I can proceed. Also, if this method helps anyone, feel free to use itp  pThanks, Mattp

Negative 469 pIs it possible to initialize an nstimer a certain number of times without having to set the timer as a property The reason I want this is because I am constantly allocating new timers at certain periods in my application and so I cant use a property because once i invalidate the property timer it cant be used anymore.p  pin the code[NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval targetselector userInfonil repeats]code method can i use the target parameter to pass in the timer itself as a parameter in the selector i specify sorry, i dont really no what the target thing means in the method.p  pif that doesnt work could I maybe try the  code[NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval invocation repeats]code and use the invocation property to help me do this or something Sorry I dont know what the invocation parameter in this method is either, I looked at the documentation but I still dont understand.p
Negative 469 pI am having issues with codeltBR gtcode tags appearing inside of a prepopulated textarea form with no breaks obviously. So these break tags need to be converted to codencode within the textarea. This prepopulated text is being retrieved via the URL which also appears to have the break tags within it as well. p  pstrongBasically what is going on and what I needstrongp  pI am having to get a block of text from the previous page which was originally pulled from the database and load that block of text into a textarea field on the form submission page. The user then fills out the rest of the form fields and submits the form, this information is then stored into a specific table in the database.p  pIn order to get the block of text to display properly on the first page, I had to use codenl2brcode to get this section breaking properly on the page. Obviously, now it is outputting that text with breaks instead of new lines. p  pThis means when you click on the link to populate the form on the next page, the link has break tags in it, which in turn gets displayed inside of the textarea field on the next page as well as in the URL.p  pI am confused on what I need to do to replace those codeltBR gtcodes with codencode again. It seems like I could use codestrreplacecode or codepregreplacecode, but I have yet to find an example of how to use either of those in conjunction with something likep  precodelttextarea rows10 cols50gtlt ifissetGET[textproperty] echo GET[textproperty] gtlttextareagt codepre  pKeep in mind that I am still in the process of learning PHP, so I really need specifics and preferably examples if at all possible.p  pThanksp
Negative 469 pAs I have played around with the TypeScript language, I got confused by the bahaviour of the strongclass member shorthand syntaxstrong together with stronginheritancestrong. Say you have the following valid TypeScript with two semantic intendical classes and an interface with one propertyp  precode    class Person1 implements HasName        constructorpublic name string            class Person2 implements HasName        public name  string       constructorname string          this.name  name                  interface HasName        name  string      codepre  pNow if you try to rename the name property in the HasName interface, only the member in Person2 will be correctly renamed and in Person1 you will get an TypeScript error saying, that it doesnt implement HasName anymore. p  pWith this behaviour in place, it wont be possible to safely use the shorthand syntax for class members p  pIs this a strongbugstrong or strongintendedstrong As far as Im concerned, a strongrefactoring operationstrong should never ever result in a compiler strongerrorstrong. It should instead rename the short hand member in Person1 as well, which sounds like a bug to me.p

Negative 469 pI have a application that needs to run with windows which I have it successfully doing but I need it to start into the system tray which I also have it doing but this also happens when the user launches it from a desktop icon.p  pThe problem Im facing now is getting it to start in the tray at startup while allowing the user to open the application without it disappearing to the tray on the launch.p  pIve seen this achieved using a launch switch in the start up keys something like cprogram.exe h and its the h that makes the application launch in the tray.p  pIs there something like this possible or is there another way around thisp  pI have considered things like a registry key that is changed on the first launch for a day and things like that but everything that I have thought of has faults such as with the above if the computer is shutdown and turned on again. Other than creating another application for the startup Im not sure how to achieve this.p  pPlease Note The application can be terminated so having something such as it checking for a existing process and maximizing it if found is not suitable this will bring in other issues. This has also been done to an extent as only one instance can be run at one time but as stated before I could have it launch to tray on first run but if it is terminated and launched again it will go to tray again which is what I want to avoid.p

Negative 469 pA couple of days ago, id Software released the a hrefhttpsgithub.comidSoftwareDOOM3BFG relnofollowsource code of Doom 3 BFG editiona. It is a VS 2010 solution with C projects in it. I want to compile it. Since I dont have a lot of money to buy a new VS license every two years, I use VS 2008.

Negative 469 pIm creating a custom implementation of the GWT strongHeaderltStringgtstrong class for use on a DataGrid strongColumnstrong that also uses a strongListHandlerstrong to sort the data in this column.  Im attempting to handle and cancel Browser events in the strongHeaderstrong class such that if a user clicks on a particular ltINPUTgt strongElementstrong rendered by this custom strongHeaderstrong object,  we prevent the mousedown Event from bubbling back up to the DataGrids event handleras this incorrectly triggers the strongListHandlerstrongs column sorting methods, preventing the user from entering data into the ltINPUTgt strongElementstrong in question.p  pIm able to successfully isolate the events whose bubble up we want to cancel by implementing a strongNativePreviewHandlerstrong in my strongHeaderstrong class with the following codep  precode        Override         public void onPreviewNativeEventNativePreviewEvent event              final NativeEvent natEvent  event.getNativeEvent             final Element element  natEvent.getEventTarget.cast             final String eventType  natEvent.getType                              if mousedown.equalseventType                  if element.getTagName.equalsINPUT                      natEvent.preventDefault                     natEvent.stopPropagation                     event.cancel                                           return              codepre  pUnfortunately no combination of the empreventDefaultem, emstopPropagationem, or emevent.cancelem methods successfully stop the mousedown event from bubbling up to the parent strongDataGridstrongs handlers.  When I attempted to debug this issue, I was able to confirm that although strongDOMstrong.empreviewEventem method successfully called the strongDOMstrong.emeventCancelBubbleem and strongDOMstrong.emeventPreventDefaultem, the strongDOMstrong.emdispatchEventem method was still fired and ultimately triggered the strongDataGridstrong.emfireEventem and a strongColumnSortEventstrong.p  pAny guidanceapproaches to prevent the GWT DataGrid from resorting itself if a particular portion of a custom Header is clicked would be greatly appreciatedp

Negative 469 pAs far as I know there are two ways to avoid ConcurrentModificationException while one threading iterates the collection and another thread modifies the collection. p  ol liclientlocking, basically lock the collection during the iteration. Other threads that need to access the collection will block until the iteration is complete.li lithreadconfined that clones the collection and iterate the copy.li ol  pI am wondering are there any other alternatives   because the first way obvious is undesirable and poor performancewise, if the collection is large that other threads could wait for a long time. second way I am not sure that since we clone the collection, and iterate the copy, so if other threads come in and modify the original one, then the copied one becomes stale right   does that mean we need to restart over by cloning and iterate it again once its modified p

Negative 469 pI was writing a method which should handle loweruppercase letters by receiving virtualcodes as you know the virtualcode always returns a code and can not render uppercase or lowercase letters by itself. If anyone is interested, I found a solution by using the codeControl.IsKeyLockedcode and codeControl.ModifierKeyscode classesp  precodebool isCapsLockOn  Control.IsKeyLockedKeys.CapsLock bool isShiftOn  Control.ModifierKeys  Keys.Shift codepre  pThe first solution I was trying to implement was to handle the shift key using Control.IsKeyLocked, not long after I found out that IsKeyLocked should be used ONLY for keys which can be actually locked like numlock, capslock, etc. The following code DID NOT WORKp  precodebool isLShiftOn  Control.IsKeyLockedKeys.LShiftKey bool isRShiftOn  Control.IsKeyLockedKeys.RShiftKey codepre  pOkay I actually found the solution to my problem by handling whether the caps lock is onoff and whether the shift is actually pressed using Control.IsKeyLocked and Control.ModifierKeys combined with an if statement to handle lowercase when caps lock is onshift is pressed and upper case when caps lock is offshift is pressed, etc and viceversa. I am now curious why the above code DID NOT WORK and actually even the code below it did not execute. Why the compiler didnt throw an error. I suppose that this throws the application somehow in a waiting state waiting for the shift key to be locked down which can not happen.  p

Negative 469 pIm using Spree as an eCommerce solution for a website that I am building and need to customize the layout, the deface option is great but I already have a layout for the rest of my application that I want to use so there is no change between the main part of my site and the store. p  pHaving looked through the spree source code I have been able to transfer most of the infrastructure over to my own new template but I have hit one stumbling block. In the default template above the search box there are  loginaccount and logout links which based on some digging through the code is rendered in the header partial which itself renders the nav bar which renders the search bar partial, and the main nav bar which shows the links to home and the shopping cart, but nowhere mentions the user inout stuff. Commenting out the rendering of the header partial removes all of this stuff but also the user information, which as far as I can tell isnt mentioned anywhere...p  pDoes anyone know where in the default spree layout it implements this code for showing a loginlogout account link, I could do this relatively simply with basic links to it but would rather understand how Spree implements this itself and Im trying to keep my layout compatible with any updates to the core code.p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated, thanksp  pEdited For clarityp

Negative 469 pIf youve read some of my previous questions you know I had a problem that I solved with iFrames. Anyways, what I would like now is to be able to update the page that the iFrame shows its a local page of mine when I click an update button. How is this possible without updating the page Im onp  pBackground info Im on home.php where I have an iFrame. This iFrame shows the page something.php, which is one of my pages. I had to be able to update home.php without waiting for something.php to update, so the solution was to place them in two documents and then include it using iFrames now home.php can be shown without waiting for something.php. The content of this something.php is dynamic and updates based on other webpages. Lets say the user wants to update the content of this iFrame, or the content doesnt show up. He will then be given an button update which will just refresh the something.php page, without refreshing home.phpp  pCan this be done preferably in PHP, but JavaScriptjQuery is also welcomep

Negative 469 pI am trying to execute this matlab chart. Here is my code so far which does not seem to work.p  pBasically, if X is greater then 10, then it goes to a section where X  X  index, and index is equal to the start value. Each time the loop is executed, the the value of X is added to the value of the index, and the X and the index are ran back through the X  X  index section, until the index is above the end value. p  pIf Xlt10, then it goes to X  X  index, and index is equal to the start value. Each time the loop is executed, the index is added to the X to update the X,the index is added to the increment to update the index , and the X and the index are ran back through the X  X  index section, until the index is above the end value. p  pDoes this make sensep  precodeif X gt 10    index  startvalue    for X  [Xindex  increment endvalue]       Y X  index       index  index  increment       fprintfi, in, Y, index    end elseif X lt 10    index  startvalue    for X  [X index  increment endvalue]       Y  X  index       index  index  increment       fprintfi, in, Y, index    end end codepre

Negative 469 pIt is known that the C language supports two kinds of memory allocation through the variables in C programsp  blockquote   p1 Static allocation is what happens when you declare a static   variable. Each static variable defines one block of space, of a fixed   size. The space is allocated once, when your program is started, and   is never freed.p      p2 Automatic allocation happens when you declare an automatic   variable, such as a function argument or a local variable. The space   for an automatic variable is allocated when the compound statement   containing the declaration is entered, and is freed when that compound   statement is exited.p blockquote  pthis is a full quote from a hrefhttpwww.cs.utah.edudeptoldtexinfoglibcmanual0.02library3.html relnofollowhttpwww.cs.utah.edudeptoldtexinfoglibcmanual0.02library3.htmlap  pThe question is is it correct to call a static variable in a function local in terms of memory allocation and why Thanks to everyone in advance.p  pP.S. any quotes from the C standard are welcome.p

The new portlet on the left should mirror the 4 externally visible events in the EVENTS folder at the top of the front page, basically acting as a repeater to bring attention to those events on the front page.

Negative 469 pI am working on VSTO addins for excel and document level customizations.  They will be used on computers with several users 10 or so each.  By intention, we do want common database and report files on a server folder, instead we want all 10 users to be able to access a local database and reports local to computer.  Right now I am doing this by a two step install.p  pFirst an InstallShield project unpacts all the ClickOnce files, default templates, and database files to codecLIMSersTestUnitcode .  Running the application when finished runs the SetUp.exe from the ClickOnce file.  I am not having user use problems, perhaps because everything is launched from within a main document level customization.  IE Ive used this method and had multiple users login and successfully use the program.  My problem is that in deploying this it has been cumbersome to rely on users to do this successfully.  My first stab was to just include everything in a zip file and tell them to unzip it into the correct directory, but that was a disaster.p  pI would like to combine this into one install if possible.  I understand that a folder of files can be included a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarykzy0fky228vvs.8029.aspx relnofollowwith the VSTO projecta but this is put into a user specific folder.  I have not been able to figure out how to change this output path relative to root.  Im still doing a lot of Googling on this, but Im not even sure if its possible.p  pOn the flip side, Ive not been able to get InstallShield to properly install the document level customization.  Ive been trying to find an example of this online and so far I have failed.  Ive tried including the manfests from the ClickOnce publication, along with the primary outputs of the VSTO project, but Ive gotten no where.  Im currently examining the registry and files created by the ClickOnce install to try and clone it.  It does a lot more on the security side of things than I realized.  I tried changing the registry path for the Excel Addin to under a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6647522vstooutlook2007deploymentforalluserrHKEYLOCALMACHINEa, but that so far hasnt helped.p  pSo my distilled questions are  Can I deploy files to a folder based on root path with ClickOnce If so how Is there an obvious way or example of how to deploy a VSTO with InstallShield I found a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenusvstoff937654.aspx relnofollowthisa but I havent been able to get it work.  I am still working that end though.  If anyone knows of a better guide, please let me know.p

Negative 469 pOkay, for a basic example say I have an application with expenses and each expense in my SQL database has an Id, Employee Id and the Amount. Should I do thisp  precodepublic class Expense      public int Id  get set      public Employee Employee  get set      public decimal Amount  get set   codepre  pOr Thisp  precodepublic class Expense      public int Id  get set      public int EmployeeId  get set      public decimal Amount  get set   codepre  pYou see I would normally do the first and when I fetch an expense from the database I would set the Employee field by calling a constructor like codeEmployee  new Employeeint idcode this would then make another trip to the DB to complete the members in the Employee object. This is handy because now I can access the Employees membersfunctions via the expense.. I.E. if I bound as a ObjectDataSource I could display something like codeEvalEmployee.Namecode and show something more friendly then just a number as it is stored in the DB.p  pHowever the current project Im working on may run up 10s of thousands of rows and the number of DB requests is going to sky rocket if im fetching first expense details and then employee details for each object. and in fact my current project has a table with 67 foreign keys.p  pIs there some way of having my cake and eating it toop  pMaybe by having an interface class only with Id fields and not the full object fields but I feel like Ive never fully understood Interfaces so Im not sure if that would make a difference.p  pThanks to anyone who has read this far even if you dont have any answer for me.p

Negative 469 pIm in the frustrating situation of having an intermittent error.  When functional, PHP specifies a video and 3 pictures to be displayed.  The video begins playing 800ms after the page loads, and the pictures are displayed immediately upon the end of the video, at which point a user presses a key corresponding to the location of the picture and the keypress triggers a function that measures reaction time, stores which picture they selected, and loads the next page, whereupon all of this happens again with a new video and new pictures. p  pThat all works just fine... sometimes. p  pAt other times, I get a blank screen where I was expecting to see the video.  Sometimes it happens right away, sometimes after as many as 15 or 20 successful loads, or anywhere in between.  Im running Chrome 27.0.1453.93, and tracking errors using Chromes builtin javascript console.  Even when the video fails to load, there are no javascript errors with DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC W3CDTD HTML 4.01EN.  p  pTo pinpoint where things are breaking down, Ive added a bunch of event listeners and used anonymous functions to pass some output to the js console log file to see which stages of the video event are or arent happening.

When the camera is powered off the framegrabber viewed in either camorama, vlc or gstreamerproperties programs is blue, and when the camera is powered on, the image received from the camera is very noisy. No features can be detected but changes in light can be seen.p  pWe have had the camera working before properly implying that the drivers are ok, however it appears that it is almost random, and dependent on what viewing programs we use and in what order. Once the camera is working, it remains working until we power off the robot. We think this means that the camera is not initialised properly, and so is sending noisy data. Does anyone know of a good way to initialise a camera linked to a BTTV PCI device, besides just ensuring the camera is powered onp  pSpecifically the camera is part of a manipulator which is installed on a SeekurJr robot from Mobile Robotics. It is required that the manipulator is initialised turning the camera on before viewing the stream, which we do. p  pThe camera is a RVision SEE camera.p  pQuestions How can we initialise the camera Any other ideas on how to fix the noisep  pThanksp

Negative 469 pI honestly dont know where to start on this one. But I got the idea in my head, and I would very much like to see if its possible to execute.p  pIm using a hrefhttpsgithub.compotomakjqueryinstagram relnofollowInstagram jQuery plugina to load instagram images based on a hashtag. What I would like to achieve or rather, have someone help me achieve is to set the number of images to load AND their width depending on the window size.p  pex. 1 if window is 1200px wide, load 12 picture with a width of 100px on each image ex. 2 if window is 800px wide, load 10 pictures with a width of 80px on each image etc...p  pBut this has to be done dynamically so that the number of images and their width always correspond to a total of the windows width. This is for one, to make sure that there is only one row of images without the use of overflow hidden etc.p  pHere is what I have so farp  precodedocument.readyfunction  var instacontainer  .instaflow, instanexturl  instacontainer.instagram     hash ASuperAwesomeHashTag,     clientId  MYCLIENTID,     show  16,     onComplete  function photos, data          instanexturl  data.pagination.nexturl         var instaimg  img.instagramimage         instaimg.css width window.width1         button.onclick, function var button  this, text  button.text      if button.text  LOADING ampamp button.hasClassiconplussignalt         button.removeClassiconplussignalt         button.addClassloading         button.textLOADING         instacontainer.instagram             nexturl  instanexturl,             show  8,             onComplete  functionphotos, data                  if .instagramplaceholder.children.text                       button.remove                                  instanexturl  data.pagination.nexturl                 button.texttext                 button.removeClassloading                 button.addClassiconplussignalt                              codepre  pSo, the show value has to be relativ to how much width there is to utilize. Loading 20 photos in a window that is only 600px wide wont look nice.  I want to make sure that there is only ONE row of images without using overflow hidden on DIVs etc. Since there is a load more button, it wouldnt show the more pictures if they are trapped in a DIV that cuts of. Thats why I also need to define the width based on the number of images with the width of the window.p  pI understand that this might be adiffuse question. But if anybody feels they can help me in getting this done I would very much appreciate it.p

Negative 469 pMy desktop .NET 3.5 application uses codeWebRequest.BeginGetResponsecode to issue a request which is used to implement long polling.

Negative 469 pI am currently starting a massive web app project, and one of the requirements is that down the line I may be required to allow an iOS and Android app to interface with my application,  I figured the best solution was to create a RESTful API and have the web application interface with it.  However, my coworker who does front end development is unfamiliar with using a javascript framework such as backbone.js more of a library I know, ember.js or angular.js.  Since were using asp.net I figured that the I could handle authentication and routing using asp.net MVC, delivering seperate views depending on the route, and he can handle the data manipulation only,  However, I cant seem to figure out how to seperate routing from the javascript framework, Ive looked into ember.js and backbone and both of them seem to require routing to be handled on their end for it to really work.p  pDoes anyone have any idea how to implement data manipulation without the need for routingp

Negative 469 pI have an element common to all pages that uses a font called Just Another Hand provided by Google Fonts API. On one of my pages, the element coincidentally happens to load in front of a Google Map and I noticed that when this happens the font rendering changes to a more eyepleasing, fuzzier but smoother appearance see screenshots below. I am using Chrome v.29 on Windows 8.p  pFurther observations Notice the grey header text also visible in screenshot does not change dependent on the presence of a Google Map. Use the inspector to remove the zindex property and the font rendering will return to its original, less eyepleasing state. The element has to be in front of the Map for any effect to happen. p  pWhy is this happening and can I leverage one of the technologies to forcesuppress this effect p  pP.S. I appreciate this is not a coding question by I am hoping it will receive a coding answer.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comNwc8l.png altScreenshot of page without a Google Map behind elementp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comjBryL.png altScreenshot of page with a Google Map behind elementp
Negative 469 pI have two different applications on ASP.NET MVC running on the same server.p  pBoth apps works against the same database, but shows different data to users they are also used by different users.p  pThe fact is that there are some methods on the model of the firstly created app that Id like to use on the second one, and I dont wanna duplicate the model logic behind those methods.p  pSo for now Im using a server call from one app to another, that call executes a controller who calls the target method and returns the response.p  pIt works fine, but I dont like to have this controller open to any user calling it. Its not particulary critical information but it seems to me like a serious security problem. p  pSo Ive been studying different options.p  ul liI can let that particular controller open to anyone knowing its out there. Bad.li liI can, somewhat, prompt users for login when the method is called. But the petition is transparent to the user so Id like to maintain it this way.li liI can elaborate a tokendance between both applications similar to authentication through oAuth protocol to ensure that app1 accepts the login on app2 and executes without a direct login, but this seems like a lot of work for something that should be quite light in the overall project.li liI can let the controller open to anyone, but on execution check the machine from where the petition is coming and throwing an exception if it isnt the same as the running server both apps runs on same server instead of returning the result.li ul  pAt this very moment the idea that likes me the most is this last one. I wonder if anyone out there sees any obvious nono that Im not being aware of or can suggest a better approach to this.p  pAlso Im getting dificulties checking application server and requesting machine. Anyone could throw some light about how could I check thisp

Negative 469 pI installed TomCat using the default port 8080.  The hosted application started to get some significant use.  Today I got an email from someone else who says that their network security rules do not allow them to access any web server that is not on port 80.p  pI resolved the issue by running TomCat on both port 80 and 8080, however, I keep thinking how silly this security rule is.  Clearly, harmful servers can be run on any port, including port 80.  Does running a server on port 80 make it in any way more trustable  I am assuming that this rule was created at one time long ago when someone found a rogue server running on a non80 port, and decided the best way to prevent this was to block all HTTP servers that are not on port 80.  In other words an inappropriate overgeneralization.p  pPerhaps I simply am not aware of it, but is there some valid rationale for restricting users to only access web servers on port 80p

[self createGLBuffers] [self releaseRedundantContent]   Select an appropriate shader program for each mesh node in this scene now. If this step  is omitted, a shader program will be selected for each mesh node the first time that mesh  node is drawn. Doing it now adds some additional time up front, but avoids potential pauses  as each shader program is loaded as needed the first time it is needed during drawing. [self selectShaderPrograms]   With complex scenes, the drawing of objects that are not within view of the camera will  consume GPU resources unnecessarily, and potentially degrading app performance. We can  avoid drawing objects that are not within view of the camera by assigning a bounding  volume to each mesh node. Once assigned, the bounding volume is automatically checked  to see if it intersects the cameras frustum before the mesh node is drawn. If the nodes  bounding volume intersects the camera frustum, the node will be drawn. If the bounding  volume does not intersect the cameras frustum, the node will not be visible to the camera,  and the node will not be drawn. Bounding volumes can also be used for collision detection  between nodes. You can create bounding volumes automatically for most rigid nonskinned  objects by using the createBoundingVolumes on a node. This will create bounding volumes  for all decendant rigid mesh nodes of that node. Invoking the method on your scene will  create bounding volumes for all rigid mesh nodes in the scene. Bounding volumes are not  automatically created for skinned meshes that modify vertices using bones. Because the  vertices can be moved arbitrarily by the bones, you must create and assign bounding  volumes to skinned mesh nodes yourself, by determining the extent of the bounding  volume you need, and creating a bounding volume that matches it. Finally, checking  bounding volumes involves a small computation cost. For objects that you know will be  in front of the camera at all times, you can skip creating a bounding volume for that  node, letting it be drawn on each frame. [self createBoundingVolumes]       Thats it The scene is now constructed and is good to go.   To help you find your scene content once it is loaded, the onOpen method below contains  code to automatically move the camera so that it frames the scene. You can remove that  code once you know where you want to place your camera.   If you encounter problems displaying your models, you can uncomment one or more of the  following lines to help you troubleshoot. You can also use these features on a single node,  or a structure of nodes. See the CC3Node notes for more explanation of these properties.  Also, the onOpen method below contains additional troubleshooting code you can comment  out to move the camera so that it will display the entire scene automatically.

The text is displayed centered on the pivot point origin of the node.   self.shouldDrawAllDescriptors  YES   Displays bounding boxes around those nodes with local content eg meshes.   self.shouldDrawAllLocalContentWireframeBoxes  YES   Displays bounding boxes around all nodes. The bounding box for each node  will encompass its child nodes.   self.shouldDrawAllWireframeBoxes  YES   If you encounter issues creating and adding nodes, or loading models from  files, the following line is used to log the full structure of the scene.

Negative 469 pI am porting a iOS game to Android using cocos2dx. The idea of the game is to deform a image and convert it into physics shapes in realtime. The logic of the game is to first create a CGContext out of a texture using CGContextDrawImage and then manipulate the context on touch using different blend modes like sop  precode  CGContextSetBlendModecontext, kCGBlendModeMultiply   CGContextDrawImagecontext, rect, texture codepre  pAfter that the dirty pixels are updated in the texturep  precode  glTexSubImage2DGLTEXTURE2D, 0, x, y, w, h, GLALPHA, GLUNSIGNEDBYTE, dirtyPixels codepre  pThis works fine on iOS but not on Android since it doesnt have core graphics doh. I am looking for a way to make this code platform independent and since the blending of two images  is really simple my idea was to swap the CGContextDrawImage with my own code to blend pixels in memory. p  pIf i would implement my own code for blending pixels would it be much slower than using core graphics even if i would optimize the blending in every way possible or should i find a way and implement the blending for each platform separately using core graphics on iOS and whatever is available on Android Or is there a better way i have tried offloading blending on the GPU but the sync to get the pixels back is too slowp

Columnizer is an OK performer for my purposesas long as there is no floated content within the chunk being columnized. p  pChrome, FF and IE10 all have similar performance on pure text or text with images and other simple html mixed in, for the most part.

You havent lived until you wait for Safari on an iPad to build this thing  multiply the windows chrome numbers by 4.p  pSo my question strongWhat is firefox doing right without being asked, and what can I do to rework the columnizer code to mimic it in the other browsersstrong Columnizer is fairly dirty in that it does thousands I think over 100,000 in this books case of appends, which I know is definitely Not Cool. Is it using document fragments Some other trickp  pColumnizer requires that the destination container where it does its content flow to be in the dom so that styles can be applied correctly ie, no displaynone and then toggling when done. In my CSS, I set this to positionabsolute, visibilityhidden, as recommended. Im thinking FF must view this set of attributes in a way the other browsers dont. Or...p  pI should note at the end of the process, except for the slight font rendering differences, the output is identical among the browsers.p

But the first time when I try to move for example to left, the circle goes to right. The opposite is the same. If I try to go to right in the beginning, the circle goes to left. When I try to go Up and Down the result is the same. So, as I said, when I go to left, it goes to right. But if I press again left, the movement stops and I can move the circle correctlyto left and right. I should do the same thing to repair the direction if I want to go Up and Down. Do I have a mistake in my codep  pAnd my second question is In the update function I have written the code that is in the book. But if I want to go Up, I think I should add 1 to y, not to substract 1. And if I want to go down, shouldnt I substract 1 I think that the update function should look like thisp  precodevoid Gameupdate              sfVector2f movement0.f, 0.f         if movingUp movement.y  1.f Here we should add 1         if movingDown movement.y  1.f Here we should substract 1         if movingLeft movement.x  1.f         if movingRight movement.x  1.f          myPlayer.movemovement      codepre  pMaybe it will be better for you to run the code if you are able in order to see what exactly is happening.p

So I started programming all properties in classes instead, but I havent really worked with classes before, so its pretty new to me. p  pIm facing another issue the .additemproperty is limited to 9 columns on the ListBox, and therefore Id like to use another method for this.

Id like 14 columns to be shown on the ListBox, and furthermore have the ability to expand if needed later on.  p  pListView arent really an option due to the fact, that many computers doesnt have this reference integrated. p  pClassmodule. clsCustomersp  precodeOption Explicit  Private cID As String Private cCustomerName As String Private cCompanyName As String Private cFullName As String Private cCVR As Long Private cType As String Private cGroup As String Private cCountry As String Private cStreet As String Private cZipcode As Variant Private cCity As String Private cPhoneNum As Long Private cMobileNum As Long Private cEmail As String Private cInvoiceEmail As String Private cCreationDate As Date Private cLastChange As Date Public Property Get customerID As String     customerID  cID End Property Public Property Let customerIDvalue As String     cID  value End Property Public Property Get customerName As String     customerName  cCustomerName End Property Public Property Let customerNamevalue As String     cCustomerName  value End Property Public Property Get customerCompanyName As String     customerCompanyName  cCompanyName End Property Public Property Let customerCompanyNamevalue As String     cCompanyName  value End Property Public Property Get customerFullName As String     customerFullName  cFullName End Property Public Property Let customerFullNamevalue As String     cFullName  value End Property Public Property Get customerCVR As Long     customerCVR  cCVR End Property Public Property Let customerCVRvalue As Long     cCVR  value End Property Public Property Get customerType As String     customerType  cType End Property Public Property Let customerTypevalue As String     cType  value End Property Public Property Get customerGroup As String     customerGroup  cGroup End Property Public Property Let customerGroupvalue As String     cGroup  value End Property Public Property Get customerCountry As String     customerCountry  cCountry End Property Public Property Let customerCountryvalue As String     cCountry  value End Property Public Property Get customerStreet As String     customerStreet  cStreet End Property Public Property Let customerStreetvalue As String     cStreet  value End Property Public Property Get customerZipcode As Variant     customerZipcode  cZipcode End Property Public Property Let customerZipcodevalue As Variant     cZipcode  value End Property Public Property Get customerCity As String     customerCity  cCity End Property Public Property Let customerCityvalue As String     cCity  value End Property Public Property Get customerPhoneNum As Long     customerPhoneNum  cPhoneNum End Property Public Property Let customerPhoneNumvalue As Long     cPhoneNum  value End Property Public Property Get customerMobileNum As Long     customerMobileNum  cMobileNum End Property Public Property Let customerMobileNumvalue As Long     cMobileNum  value End Property Public Property Get customerEmail As String     customerEmail  cEmail End Property Public Property Let customerEmailvalue As String     cEmail  value End Property Public Property Get customerInvoiceEmail As String     customerInvoiceEmail  cInvoiceEmail End Property Public Property Let customerInvoiceEmailvalue As String     cInvoiceEmail  value End Property Public Property Get customerCreationDate As Date     customerCreationDate  cCreationDate End Property Public Property Let customerCreationDatevalue As Date     cCreationDate  value End Property Public Property Get customerLastChange As Date     customerLastChange  cLastChange End Property Public Property Let customerLastChangevalue As Date     cLastChange  value End Property codepre  pModule. mExtendedCustomerDatabase.

Negative 469 pI am looking for an easy way to convert a MAC address to the corresponding IP address in a local network.

It will be very nice if I can use the same method on Mac, Linux and Windows machines.p  pAs far as I know, I have to broadcast a ARP packet to the network in order to retrieve a MAC address from a known IP address.

Negative 469 pI have a query that powers an Oracle Application Express Report that I was told by our users was executing slowly or at an unacceptable speed wasnt given an actual load time for the page and the query is the only thing on the page.p  pThe query involves many tables and actually references a pipelined function which identifies the currently loggedin users to our website and returns a custom table of records they have permission to based upon a custom security scheme we have.p  pMy main question is around Oracles caching of queries and how they could be affected by our setup.p  pWhen I took the query out of the webpage and ran it in Sql Developer and manually specified a user ID to simulate a loggedin user to the website, the performance went from 71 seconds to 19 seconds to .5 seconds.  Clearly, Oracle is utilizing its caching mechanism to make subsequent runs faster.p  pHow is this affected byp  ol liThe fact that different users will get different tables from the pipelined function all the same columns, just different number of rows and the values in the rows.  Does the pipelining prevent caching from working  Am I only seeing caching because Im running a very isolated testli liFurther more  is caching easily influenced by the number of people using the system  Im not sure how strongmuchstrong can get cached.  Therefore, if we have 50 concurrent users that are accessing different parts of the website that are loading different queries all day long, is it likely that oracle wont be able to cache manyany of them because it is constantly seeing different request for queriesli ol  pSorry my question isnt very technical.  p  pIm a developer who has been asked to help out in this seemingly DBA question.p  pAlso, this is complicated because I cant really determine what the actual load times are since our users dont report that level of detail.p  pAny thoughts onp  ul lihow I can determine if this query is actually slowli liwhat the average processing time would beli liand how to proceed with fine tuning if it is a problemli ul  pThanksp

Negative 469 pim working on a school project and Ive come across an issue with my FBO.p  pgame is rendered in 2 passes 1 I render to the shadow map texture using an FBO. 2 I render scene normally to the default FBO.p  pIssue is, for some reason, binding the FBO when i do the first pass slows down my game by roughly 200 fps, I really dont know what could be wrong with the FBO since its as barebones as possible.

Negative 469 pI have 2 identical views on top of each other.  One is a real one and one is supposed to act as a dummy.p  pId like to crossfade between them silently. I set one views alpha to 0 and second views alpha to 1 simultaneously in the same animation block.p  pBut the results are not smooth and Im able to see one view is fading out while the second one is fading in. Id like this animation to be silent i.e without any animation at all.p  pP.S. I cannot just set those alphas without any animation, because the real view is a part of the collection view which has to fade out and the second view dummy supposes to substitute one of collection views cells after the collection view is gone.p  pAny way to do it and why iOS renders it that wayp  pThanksp

Negative 469 pHey everyone So I have a countdown timer that I have managed to implement in my game that I saw on some forums. Now I set up a new function to add some seconds to the timer whenever the user Hittest with a Movie Clip but it doesnt seem to work right the errors Im getting is while it does add more time, Its not really adding it because when i do add more time and say the timer counts down to 10 depending on how much more seconds I added with the Hittest the game ends on 10 rather than 0 seconds.

Without stopping the debugger when I try to upload values from another spreadsheet using the addin the loops in my addin never seem to end.

Negative 469 pI am currently stuck on a problem at work that involves a possible loss of precision when the compiler configuration is changed from Debug to Release, which have different levels of optimization. For some reason, elsewhere in our code, extremely large values have been used for covariance matrices and things of that sort, values somewhere along the lines of 1e90. The problem Im encountering is that whenever there is any sort of loss of precision in a calculation and one of these extremely large values is still around, the product of the two introduces some instability. Im not sure why more reasonable values arent used, but Im not the one that wrote this code, so yeah... As of now, I believe I have tracked down the problem to a specific location. The exact numbers I have at that location are shown belowp  precodeDBL sum  6.000000040000000400e004  same for debug and release configurations const DBL dinv  2.000000020000000300e004  same for debug and release configurations codepre  pNote that DBL is your ordinary doublep  precodetypedef double DBL codepre  pThen, the following operation is performedp  precodesum  dinv codepre  pThis yieldsp  precodesum  2.999999990000000100e000  for debug configurationltbrgt sum  2.999999989999999600e000  for release configuration codepre  pI took a look at the disassembly for the two configurations and found some differences expected because of different amounts of optimization.p  pbDEBUGbbrp  precode1D91FF73  movsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [sum] 1D91FF78  divsd       xmm0,mmword ptr [dinv] 1D91FF7D  movsd       mmword ptr [sum],xmm0 codepre  pp I havent ever really read disassembly, but my understanding is as follows sum is moved to xmm0, then xmm0 is divided inplace by dinv result is in xmm0 since division is inplace, then xmm0 is moved to sum.p  pAs expected, the disassembly for release is different.p  pbRELEASEbbrp  precode1D7557AB  movsd       xmm1,mmword ptr [esp50h]   1D7557B1  xorps       xmm0,xmm0   1D7557B4  mulsd       xmm1,mmword ptr [esp68h]   codepre  pThe disassembly for the assignment of sum to dinv isp  precode1D7B55B7  movsd       xmm1,mmword ptr [esp68h]   codepre  pAm I correct in thinking that dinv is the value pointed to by the pointer represented by [esp68h] and sum is the value pointed to by the pointer represented by [esp50h] If not, what is the casep  pDoes anybody know why I am losing precision What is the purpose of codexorpscodep  pThe x86 Instruction Set Reference at this link may be helpful a hrefhttpx86.renejeschke.de relnofollowhttpx86.renejeschke.deap  pstrongUPDATEstrongbr As the answer below mentioned, the Debug configuration was using fpprecise and the Release configuration was using fpfast was using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013, to get to the build configuration settings for a project, simply rightclick on that project, click properties, then navigate to CC. For me, this resulted in roundoff errors on the order of 1e15, give or take an order. This was a problem for me because elsewhere in the code, some people were using extremely large values on the order of 1e90, give or take an order. One thing I did to break the Debug configuration for testing purposes was to split the codesum  dinvcode computation into two steps. First, take the reciprocal of codedinvcode by computing code1.0dinvcode this is mentioned as being a bad operation to perform in the answer below, multiply that result by codesumcode, and place the result into codesumcode.

Negative 469 pI have a quick question, which I am sure has been asked so I do apologize if it is a duplicate. I tried searching google and stackoverflow but the results were unrelated to my question.p  pThe scenariop  pI have a Visual Studio 2010 project configuration that defines a preprocessor named DBG. In the code, I have a ifdef DBG section that declares a function signature in the header file lets call it writeToFile and defines that function within another ifdef DBGendif section in the cpp file. Throughout the rest of the project are calls to writeToFile.p  pThe questionsp  pWhen the project is compiled under a different configuration one that doesnt define DBG, how is this handled by the compiler I know that the portions within the ifdefendif directives are pretty much ignored, but what happens to all the function calls to writeToFile Does the compiler ignore these, too Or during run time, do these calls actually occur and do nothingp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 469 pThe problem i am having is as follows The root project of my android studio project should in fact be a module. I imported it ages ago from eclipse and it must not have created the common project  module directory structure needed for gradle. p  pThis is only now becoming an issue as i have to turn the main codebase into a library project and library projects with gradle can only be created within application modules and not the root project.p  pso basically my projectp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTWq68.png altenter image description herep  pshould be looking more like this example that ive made img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comsiRci.png altenter image description herep  pI have tried adding the wrapping project folder, settings. gradle etc.. in windows explorer and building gradle but to no avail. Is there a way to add a new root to a project in android studio and turn the root into a module without breaking everything p  pNote Making a new project with the correct structure is not an option i dont think because my project is already a remote git repository on other production apps.. Any help would be greatly appreciated. p  pP.S If gradle was my girlfriend, i would have broken up with her by nowp

Negative 469 pIve a very simple example where Ive an Actor codeSimpleActorcode that perform a periodic task by sending a message to itself. The message is scheduled in the constructor for the actor. In the normal case i.e., without faults everything works fine. p  pBut what if the Actor has to deal with faults. Ive another Actor codeSimpleActorWithFaultcode. This actor could have faults. In this case, Im generating one myself by throwing an exception. When a fault happens i.e., codeSimpleActorWithFaultcode throws an exception it is automatically restarted. However, this restart messes up the scheduler inside the Actor which no longer functions as excepted. And if the faults happens rapidly enough it generates more unexpected behavior.  p  pstrongMy question is whats the preferred way to dealing with faults in such casesstrong I know I can use codeTrycode blocks to handle exceptions.

Negative 469 pIm looking at developing an application using the Yodlee FinApp API. p  pTheir REST protocol requires you to login your users to their system to retrieve data. To do that, you need to send a login and password. A successful request returns you a token that is valid for 30 minutes. Before that 30 minutes elapses, you must log the user in again in order to retrieve a new token. Heres where the problem lies, in my opinion.p  pI could set something up wherein every time a user logs into my application, I immediately send their login info and password to Yodlee and log them in there as well. Then, I wouldnt need to store their password in my database in plain text. But what happens when 30 minutes elapses I dont actually know their password, so Im unable to get them a new token and would require them to log in again. It would be a real pain to have users constantly having to log back in every 30 minutes.p  pAlternatively, I could generate my own password for them when they sign up with my app and use that for my applications interaction with Yodlee. But then I have their Yodlee password stored in my database in plain text. Assuming somebody was able to gain access to my server, theyd have my applications credentials and also all user credentials, so theyd be able to mimic my applications process for logging in and gain access to user transactions. This seems like a bad idea.p  pWhats the correct approach here It seems like both of the avenues Im investigating have serious downsides, but maybe Im missing another optionp

Negative 469 pIve been trying to replicate the usual way of doing this in Objectivec in swift for a new swift app Im playing around with.p  pHow to do this in Objectivec is well documented, you get the shared apple event manager and call codesetEventHandlercode method to register a function as the handler for the event class codekInternetEventClasscode with the event id codekAEGetURLcode.p  pSo in swift Im trying to do the same thing with this code added to the template AppDelegate.swift inside a brand new projectp  precodefunc applicationWillFinishLaunchingaNotification NSNotification      var appleEventManagerNSAppleEventManager  NSAppleEventManager.sharedAppleEventManager     appleEventManager.setEventHandlerself, andSelector handleGetURLEventwithReplyEvent, forEventClass kInternetEventClass, andEventID kAEGetURL    func handleGetURLEventevent NSAppleEventDescriptor, replyEvent NSAppleEventDescriptor      printlnyay  codepre  pAs far as I can tell this is just a syntax conversion of the standard Objectivec call.  But I get a type error for both the codeforEventClasscode and codeandEventIdcode arguments to the codesetEventHandlercode methodp  pcodeNSNumber is not a subtype of AEEventClasscode for the codeforEventClasscode argumentp  pandp  pcodeNSNumber is not a subtype of AEEventIdcode for the codeandEventIDcode argumentp  pIm not sure what Im doing wrong at this stage as both codekInternetEventClasscode and codekAEGetURLcode are constants defined by apple...  Surely Im not required to convert their codeNSNumbercode type to their respective required types  And if I am I cant work out how.p

Negative 469 pI have an application with DataGridView. I use a SQLite database and set its table as a DataSource to my DataGridView Im getting a DataSet using SQLiteDataAdapter and setting it as a DataSourcep  precodegrid.AutoGenerateColumns  false grid.DataSource  ds.Tables[0].DefaultView   grid.Columns[criteriaId].DataPropertyName  rowid grid.Columns[criteriaName].DataPropertyName  name grid.Columns[criteriaDesc].DataPropertyName  description grid.Columns[criteriaDirection].DataPropertyName  direction codepre  pSo far everything seems to be working as I want. But I want to update this DataSource, replacing all rows with other data from another dataset I got from another source. So I wrotep  precodevar originalDs  grid.DataSource as DataView var originalTable  originalDs.Table originalTable.Rows.Clear  foreach DataRow row in ds.Tables[0].Rows         var newRow  originalTable.Rows.Add      foreach DataColumn column in ds.Tables[0].Columns              object item  row[column]         var columnName  column.ColumnName         if originalTable.Columns[columnName]  null                      newRow[columnName]  item                codepre  pStill, it works as expected, all rows in my DataGridView are replaced with new data. BUT. Now I am trying to update underlying database with these changes, so I am callingp  precodevar cmdb  new SQLiteCommandBuilderadapter adapter.UpdateCommand  cmdb.GetUpdateCommand  var cm  CurrencyManagergrid.BindingContext[grid.DataSource, grid.DataMember] cm.EndCurrentEdit  grid.EndEdit adapter.Updateds.Tables[0] codepre  pWhere adapter is a SQLiteDataAdapter I used to read data from DB first. And here Im stuck with a problem instead of deleting all previous data and saving new rows to a database, all previous records are still in my database and all new rows from a new datasource are added. So its just adding and not replacing rows. In a line above codeadapter.Updateds.Tables[0]code when I debug I can see that ds.Tables[0] has only rows from a new source. So why arent old rows deleted What can I do to make it workp  pDeletng rows from DB works when I delete rows in DataGridView manually using GUI and then save it all the same way to a database.p  pAny ideasp

Negative 469 pIm running spring web services, using mongodb as backend and kendo ui grid to display data. Im trying to implement custom server side pagination, as kendo ui grids serverPagination isnt working for correctly.p  pI have set up web services that break my json response into different pages as follows. p  precodepathtojson1 pathtojson2 pathtojson3 codepre  pMy question is, is this format compatible with kendo ui grid, if so how could I load this data in the grid page by page.p  pI change my server side response, as with using specific urls, I ran into the problem where kendo grid assumed that its all of the data, and thus it only displays one page at the bottom. p  pThus now, I return a json array of original size say 10, and if the pageSize is 5, following is my servers responsep  precodePage 1    Page 2 1           x 2           x 3           x 4           x 5           x x           6 x           7 x           8 x           9 x           10 codepre  pwhere x is an empty obj.p  pThus theoretically, on page 1, kendo grid would load the first 5 elements and fill page two with empty ones. And when clicked on page 2, it would load the next five elements and fill page one with empty ones. This way, kendo gird knows the total size of json and can instantiate pages based off of that.p  pHowever, the problem I have now is that for page 1, kendo grid loads all 10 elements and the same for page 2, instead of splitting it. p  pAny idead around this, or is there an efficient way than thisp

Negative 469 pI wonder if anyone could share their thoughts on my question regarding web based APIs we use Microsoft stacks..p  pWe are currently in the process of building an infrastructure to host web apis across our business. p  pAs a organisation we have seperate business areas that provide services to our customers. These individual areas of our business generally have their own best of breed IT system. Offering APIs is something weve long thought about and we have started the design process.p  pThe APIs we aim to offer shall be web based .NETwebAPIWCF etc. and will largely 99 be consumed within our organisation but some may be exposed externally in the future should the requirement arise new mobile app may need to use the services etc.p  pId love to hear your thoughts and experiences around how you architected yuor farms. I understand its quite an open question without understanding the crooks of our requirements but its more general adviceexperiences Id like to hear.p  pParticularly we are trying to decide whether we should design the infrastrcuture byp  p1 Providing each area of the business with their own API server whereby we shall deploy each web API within a new application inside IIS.p  por p  p2 Setup up a load balanced web api farm whereby we have say 23 iis web servers, all built the same, hosting the same web apis but the business areas will all share the same server effectively. Each area would have a segregated site within iis and new APIs shall be setup under new applications inside their respective web sites.p  pI dont foresee us having thousands of APIs but some will be business critical so Im certainly bearing resilience in mind which is why as much as I like each business area having their own API server, Im being swayed towards the option of having a load balanced farm which the whole business shares.p  pAnyone have any thoughts, experiences etc.p  pThanksp

Negative 469 pHello Im pretty new at SQL Server and Ive got a problem on my home work thats killing me, this is my final problem on the home work and for some reason Im struggling with this last question.p  pThe question goes like thisp  blockquote   pUse the UNION operator to generate a result set consisting of three columns from the Orders table    ShipStatus  A calculated column that contains a value of SHIPPED or NOT SHIPPED   OrderID The OrderID column   OrderDate   The OrderDate column   If the order has a value in the ShipDate column, the ShipStatus column should contain a value of SHIPPED. Otherwise, it should contain a value of NOT SHIPPED.   Sort the final result set by OrderDate.p blockquote  pHere is what Ive got so far but it just doesnt seem to work.p  pcodeSELECT OrderID,OrderDate FROM Orders UNION SELECT ShipDate AS ShipStatus FROM Orders IF ShipDate IS NULL THEN ShipDate  Not Shipped ELSE ShipDate  Shippedcodep  pI dont want the exact answer because Id like to figure it out but a nudge in the right direction would be greatly appreciatedp  pUPDATEp  pHey guys thanks for the help With a combination of everyones help I figured it out.p  pHere was the code that ended up working.p  pcodeSELECT OrderID, OrderDate, SHIPPED AS ShipStatus  FROM Orders  WHERE ShipDate IS NOT NULL UNION SELECT OrderID, OrderDate, NOT SHIPPED AS ShipStatus FROM Orders WHERE ShipDate IS NULLcodep
Negative 469 pIm developing an iOS 8.1 app for an iPhone 5 in ObjectiveC using Xcode 6.1.p  pWhen a codeUITextViewcode is clicked, I have an invisible codeUIControlcode view that pops up just above the keyboard, so that the user can swipe down from above the keyboard and dismiss the keyboard and then move the codeUIControlcode out of view again. This is working fine. However, this codeUIControlcode view that pops up above the keyboard is covering another codeUITextViewcode such that the covered text view cannot be tapped on. Every time I try to tap on the covered text view which is visible because the codeUIControlcode is not opaque, nothing happens because the codeUIControlcode seems to just be taking the taps and not doing anything with them.p  pMy question is, how do I make it so that the codeUIControlcode simply ignores taps letting them go straight through so that the codeUITextViewcode underneath can accept them, and yet accepts swipes so that, when it is swiped downward, it can dismiss the keyboard and move out of viewp  pIve tried several solutions but havent found one that will work well for what I want.p  pThanksp

Negative 469 pI have been tasked with building an Access database to track the programs, and program versions on a handful of servers. As I am still relatively new to Access, this is proving to be quite challenging. There are quite a few different programs we are tracking, and keeping track of what server was running what, on what version, gets a little hectic.p  pThe issue I am having is allowing data to be manipulated easily through the use of forms.p  pI have set up 3 separate tables Servers, Programs, and Versions. Then on top of that two linked tables one that relates the programs to the version, TblProgVer, and then one that links the servers to TblProgVer, TblServerDetails. The main tables are set up as followsp  pltstrongTblServersstrongp  ul liServerID  PKli liServerDescriptionli ul  pltstrongTblProgramsstrongp  ul liProgramID  PKli liProgramNameli liProgramDescriptionli ul  pltstrongTblVersionstrongp  ul liVersionID  PKli liVersionDescriptionli ul  pstrongemThat being said, there are also the two linked tablesemstrongp  pltstrongTblProgVerstrongp  ul liProgVerID  PKli liProgramID  FKli liVersionID  FKli ul  pltstrongTblServerDetailsstrongp  ul liServerDetailsID  PKli liServerID  FKli liProgVerID  FKli ul  pCurrently, there are a few steps involved when adding a program to the database...p  ol liAdd the program itself in a form. li liIf the version the program is running on is not a version currently in the DB, add the version in another form.li liAssociate the program and version in yet another form.li ol  pIs this an inefficient way of manipulating the data Are there ways to cut down on the number of forms I am currently using p  pI cannot seem to get the last form, which would hopefully manipulate the ServerDetails table, to function properly either. I have the main form based on the TblServers, and the subform based on TblServerDetails. The subform pulls in values from a query I created with all of the necessary fields. The form appears as though it is correct in form view, but none of the data in the subform can be altered in any way.p  pAny advice would be much appreciated. p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 469 pFor each of my simulation runs I generate a number of mfiles using the codematlabFunctioncode command. these mfiles are used to generate artificial potential fields. The number of scalar inputs may vary among different runs due to the number of robots I am simulating, but stay constant during the run itself. Because each robot has its own potential field function I have to prepare input vectors for each of these robots. I am currently doing this in the following manner for each robot ip  precodeTvec  [T1i1,i. Ti,1i1 Ti,i1end Ti1end,i.] Xvec  reshapexN1,1,JK2 if sumleadersi     InputVector  num2cell[Tvec Xvec xd] else     InputVector  num2cell[Tvec Xvec] end  fungradfuni [gradx,grady]  funInputVector codepre  pShort explanation of the above code I have to prepare a transmission vector Tvec by extracting some values from matrix T. Furthermore I need the position vector Xvec, and pass these to the gradient function. If the robot is a leader, also the destination xd is added. gradfun is a cell of function handles that point to my generated potential field functions. InputVector is a cell array with scalar entries.p  pMy problem here is that this approach is pretty slow due to the num2cell command, which takes up almost as much time as the actual gradient computation. Is there any way to bypass using the num2cell command I am willing to edit the function inputs to the potential field functions, as long as this can be done from a matlab script i.e. this should be possible to automate rather than manually change the commaseparated inputs to a vectorbased input.p

Set the id to some unique temp value that I change to the generator value I want on trigger AFTER INSERT. emThis method feels somewhat contrived and requires a way that ensures that the temp id is unique. But what if the bookingitemid was supplied client side, how would I distinguish that from a temp id. Plus I need another triggerempli lipstrongUse Transaction Controlstrong. This is like option 1. except instead of using the tryexcept block to reset the generator I start a transaction and then roll it back if the record fails to post. emI dont know the syntax for using transaction control. I thought I read somewhere that SAVEPOINTSET TRANSACTION is not allowed in PSQL. Plus the roll back would have to happen in the AFTER INSERT trigger so once again I need another trigger.empli ol  pSurely this is an issue for any Firebird developer that wants to use Generators. Any other ideas Is there something Im missingp

Negative 469 pSpecifically, I want to be able to use Dexterity content that has a z3c relationfield pointing to a user in aclusers.sourceusers.

Since users arent content in this sense they arent cataloged.p  pIm not sure if this is even the best approach, but being able to link to a user seems simple as an abstract concept. I suppose the alternative would be to store the userid as a simple string field and listen for user management events.p

Negative 469 pI got this book Beginning C by Ivor Horton and Im half way through it and I like it so far so good. I use CodeBlocks on Windows as my IDE, and now Ive run into the problem I cannot solve for about 3 days now. p  pThe author mentions some optional functions in codeltstring.hgtcode, like codestrnlenscode, and also says that these are available in the new standard mdash C11 the book is from 2013 I dont know how new C11 actually is, and he also gives a piece of code that will determine whether the standard library that comes with your C compiler supports these optional functions.  This is the codep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  int mainvoid  if defined STDCLIBEXT1     printfOptional functions are defined.n else     printfOptional functions are not defined.n endif     return 0  codepre  pSo I run the code to check if GCC in CodeBlocks does and determine that it doesnt. The book didnt recommend the compiler nor the IDE I picked up CodeBlocks with GCC on my own, since thats what I do my exams in at college, so I figured I should get familiar with the environment.p  pThe thing is, I have no idea how to fix this, since codestrnlencode doesnt work, codestrnlenscode doesnt work, and bunch of others, and I cant really continue through a book. Not that I need them, or that I cant do it any other way codestrlencode works just fine but it would be nice to know how to use nonstandard functions.p

Negative 469 pIm trying to create a file by merging all of the data from one file and part of the data from the second file combined with part of the data from the first file assigned based on matches in column 1 of each file.

Negative 469 pSo, Im trying to setup a semiRESTful Express app with a modular directory structure. p  pI started off by watching TJs video on Vimeo a hrefhttpsvimeo.com56166857 relnofollowhttpsvimeo.com56166857a, on how to setup a modular express app. I really like the way he does it, and would like to extend an app off of it. p  pThe problem is, I think Passport.js messes up how it handles authentication as a result of the modular setup he has going on.

Negative 469 pCould anyone please help to see if there are any potential disadvantages with this approachp  pIn our scenario, where we have multiple projects which get added frequently, we wanted to minimize the effort of creating jobs, so we thought of reusing the jobs with different parameters. And we are using pipelines and parameterized trigger plugins in order to achieve this dependency between the jobs. Here in our case, we have startup, build, test and deploy jobs setup as a pipeline. Startup job is to just accept parameters to trigger the down line jobs such as source code location and common workspace for subsequent jobs. For every new project, we are adding a new startup job with different parameters and triggering the build job which is common for all the projects with parameters being different.p  pAppreciate if anyone can suggest potential disadvantages that we might encounter down the line with this approach.p  pThanks in advance, Santoshp

The files are loaded into the GUI then threads are launched that perform the analysis and adjustment steps and finally the results of those processes are displayed in the main window. p  pI have endeavored to write thread safe code however, some threads still arbitrarily fail to complete it should be noted that when I manually launch them a second time, they typically run to completion. Below I have included an abridged version of my program, which contains classes for the AnalysisThread, the AdjustThread, and the MainWindow. Buttons in the main window are bound to the functions OnAnalyze and OnAdjust, which create instances of the appropriate thread classes. The threads themselves communicate with the GUI via wx.CallAfter and Publisher. To my understanding, this should allow data to be passed safely back and forth between the main process and the threads. If someone could kindly point out where I went wrong with the code below, Id be very grateful.p  pIf I cannot fix the thread safety issue, my backup plan is to somehow detect the death of a thread and try to resuscitate it under the hood, without the user knowing there was a glitch. Does this seem reasonable If so, advice on how to accomplish this would be most welcome.p  pThanks very much.p  precodeusrbinpython  import wx import time from threading import Thread import os, sys, re, subprocess, shutil from wx.lib.pubsub import setuparg1 from wx.lib.pubsub import pub as Publisher   Start a thread that analyzes audio files. class AnalysisThreadThread     def initself,args         Thread.initself         self.file  args[0]         self.index  args[1]         self.setDaemonTrue         self.start      def runself        proc  subprocess.Popen[ffmpeg, nostats, i, self.file, filtercomplex, ebur128peaktruesample, f, null, ], bufsize1, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, stderrsubprocess.STDOUT        flag  0        summary          while proc.poll is None           line  proc.stdout.readline           if line              endProcess  re.searchrSummary, line              if endProcess is not None                 flag  1              if flag                 summary  line         wx.CallAfterPublisher.sendMessage, update, self.file, summary, self.index  Start a thread that adjusts audio files so that they conform to EBU loudness standards. class AdjustThreadThread     def initself,args         Thread.initself         self.file  args[0]         self.index  args[1]         self.IL  args[2]         self.TP  args[3]         self.SP  args[4]         self.setDaemonTrue         self.start      def runself         proc  subprocess.Popen[ffmpeg, nostats, i, adjustedfile, filtercomplex, ebur128peaktruesample, f, null, ], bufsize1, stdoutsubprocess.PIPE, stderrsubprocess.STDOUT        flag  0        summary          while proc.poll is None           line  proc.stdout.readline           if line              endProcess  re.searchrSummary, line              if endProcess is not None                 flag  1              if flag                 summary  line         wx.CallAfterPublisher.sendMessage, update, self.file, summary, self.index   class MainWindowwx.Frame      fileList  collections.OrderedDict      def initself, parent, id, title         wx.Frame.initself, parent, id, title, size900, 400          Publisher.subscribeself.UpdateDisplay, update          Add analyze and Adjust buttons to the main frame.         panel  wx.Panelself, 1         vbox  wx.BoxSizerwx.VERTICAL         self.ana  wx.Buttonpanel, 1, Analyze, size100, 1         self.adj  wx.Buttonpanel, 1, Adjust, size100, 1         self.Bindwx.EVTBUTTON, self.OnAnalyze, idself.ana.GetId         self.Bindwx.EVTBUTTON, self.OnAdjust, idself.adj.GetId         vbox.Addself.ana, 0, wx.ALL, 10         vbox.Addself.adj, 0, wx.ALL, 10         vbox.Addself.list, 1, wx.EXPAND  wx.TOP, 3         vbox.Add1, 10         panel.SetSizerhbox          self.Centre         self.ShowTrue      This function gets called when Analyze is pressed.     def OnAnalyzeself, event          for file,index in toAnalyze             Add a progess bar            item  self.list.GetItemindex,2            gauge  item.GetWindow            gauge.Pulse             Launch the analysis thread            AnalysisThreadargsfile,index,      This function gets called when Adjust is pressed.     def OnAdjustself, event          for file,index in toAdjust            gauge  wx.Gaugeself.list,1,range50,sizewidth,15,stylewx.GAHORIZONTAL  wx.GASMOOTH            gauge.Pulse shouldnt start this right away...            item.SetWindowgauge, wx.ALIGNCENTRE            self.list.SetItemitem              Launch the adjust thread            AdjustThreadargsfile,index,intloud,truepeak,samplepeak      This function is invoked by the Publisher.     def UpdateDisplayself, msg        t  msg.data         file  t[0]        summary  t[1]        i  t[2]        self.ProcessSummaryfile, summary, i          item  self.list.GetItemi,2        gauge  item.GetWindow        gauge.SetValue50        self.fileList[file][1]  True      Display information from the threads in the main frame.     def ProcessSummaryself, file, summary, i       loudnessRange  re.searchrLRAs.

When it is possible to be linear, it should be. I thought of solution where I would fit middlepoints of intervals with some spline, but that will bring problems with overfitting and it is clear that the function could be smoother in some sense, though i dont have exact metric for that. In my example image it will create a clearly bad solution and this will be the case even if no linear solution exists.p  pI know that this smoothness criteria is somehow vague. Function f will be a movement of machine in one axis in time, so I need it to move as little as possible without any jumps or rapid velocity changes, but I dont want to define this too precisely, as it would narrow down possible approaches.p  pI have never encountered a similar problem neither in work nor during my studies and i dont know whether it has some standard name which i could google and research further.

Negative 469 pHoping this is simple.  My goal is to have my masterpage carry a formview which can bind data retrieved based on variable held in my content page, or in the alternative based on variable held as a session variable.

Negative 469 pCan I take one of the codeMyHousecode objects that I instantiate, and somehow set it to scale proportionately with its underlying codeNscComponentcode containerp  pWhen I use the codesetSizecode method, which is inherited from codeNscComponentcode, it does not change the size of the codehouse1 MyHousecode object. It makes the container smaller, but not the object, and the container resizes and clips out most of the codehouse1code object. I had tried to create a new method inside codeMyHouse.javacode that resizes each of the codeMyHousecode components that make up the whole house, and that worked, but then the coordinates were all screwed up and the house itself looked like it was all broken apart.p  pIt seems like having to manipulate each individual component of codeMyHousecode objects to resize defeats the whole point of creating an object.p  pHere is the codeMyHousecode codep  precode   A new graphic component.

Negative 469 pIve developed a C program which calculates a set of coordinates x, y within a loop.

I have a Matlab function that then takes this coordinate and uses it in real time however, I havent found an effective way of sending variables quickly from C to Matlab.p  pIve tried using the Matlab engine here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31714139passingvariablefromctomatlabworkspacePassing Variable from C to Matlab Workspacea, except I want this variable to be used in the existing Matlab session and not simply run Matlab commands through C.p  pIve also tried writing the C coordinate to a binary file and then reading this file in Matlab  this method is very fast but Im having problems with the timing between both languages. Setting the Matlab code to an infinite loop reading the binary file, whilst running the C program writing the coordinate to the file, means that Matlab reads in a very strange order ie. Matlab reads 15, 200, 70, 12 when I write the i values to file.

Negative 469 pIve created a little app for the kids at home which connects to my Drobo were I have roughly 1000 movies. The app obtains all the information for these movies and stores the info in a SQLite database. p  pIm having trouble playing the media from the file path using the MediaElement Control.p  pIm using c with MVVM, the problem I have is, most samples show you how to pick a file and play it using a stream. This is fine however I dont want the kids 2 and 5 yrs old to have to do this each time.p  pIn attempt to avoid this and im storing the file location in my database ie 192.168.1.3MoviesMicky Mouse.mp4p  pive created the code to set the source using a URI and binded the controls source xaml to the property. As you can guess the media is not playing.p  pIf I put the media into local storage it plays fine so I know the issue is directly related to access permissions. What I have found is, if I choose the folder location and play the movie say 5mins later it will play however if I attempt this the following day the video does not play.p  pTo me there seems to be a timed access token to the NAS drive.p  pDoes anyone here achieve video playback outside of local storage using a URI filepathp  pThank you for any guidancep

Negative 469 pSo I am having an issue with my serial communication between Python and an Arduino Uno. I have Python sending the number 38 along with other numbers through serial communication by a bytearray to Arduino and then back to Python. p  pThe array I am sending isp  precode [230, 0, 0, 0, 38]  codepre  pAnd the array it is printing out when using print isp  precodebytearraybxe6x00x00x00amp codepre  pThe ampersand is there because there is a weird nuance in the printing of the bytearray that when the number is between a certain range sorry I cant remember the range it prints it out in ASCII rather then hexidecimal, so the array I am sending to Arduino should still have all of the information needed. p  pI am receiving the information in Arduino byp  precodechar values[5]     Serial.readbytesvalues, 5 codepre  pOnce arduino reveives the information, I use Serial.write to send it back to  Python, where I print them out to ensure I have received the correct information. This output received in Python isp  precodebxe6x00x00x00xf6  codepre  pwhere the 0xe6 is 230 correct and 0xf6 is 246 which is incorrect, it should be the hex value for 38 which is 0x26. p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions as to how to fix this Any suggestions or help would be appreciatedp  pEDIT  Found my problem, I accidentally had a  misplaced minus 0 because at one point I thought that I had to transform the information from ASCII to hex, but it turns out that I dont.

Negative 469 pSite a hrefhttpsnordicecommercesummit.semalmo relnofollowhttpsnordicecommercesummit.semalmoap  pThis is my last ditch effort to fix GA on our site. Weve had it running for the better part of 2 years now without incident. Over the summer though we added a few new pages and redesigned some things, thats when I noticed that it had stopped tracking. The site is WordPress with Cloudfare SSL. SSL was added around the same time as the redesign. Only one jQuery plugin was added, however, this is on our other sites without any issues. p  pIm stumped, and Ive tried seemingly everything. Heres the list per Googles advicep  ul liReadd tracking jsli liMoved tracking codeoriginally in the footer, but moved around to head and bodyli liChanged target url to https I suspected our switch to https could be the problem, Cloudfareli liRemoved any possible conflictsli liUsed GA Debuggerli ul  pAll of this was to no avail. Says its still not installed. Google said they see that its not tracking but confirm it should be working. They advised that it was on my end, or WordPress.p  pSo I was hoping someone might be able to lead me down the right road to fix this irritating issue. Im a front end dev, so I only dabble in JS when needed. So I presume it could be a script conflict, but it just doesnt that way. But since my knowledge of JS is limited, Id love a little input. p

Negative 469 pIs there a common pattern to change navigation bar contents without changing UITableView content, scroll position, other elements etcp  pI have a Navigation bar with a title and a button. On press of this button I wish the bar to display a text box instead of the title and another button with another action. On tap outside text bar or button segue unwinds.p  pThe obvious way is to push a segue to another scene without animation, reimplement the same UITableView content and position, but I find this quite inefficient.p  pAnother way is to try doing it on the same scene. I tried to place text box on the titles place of navigation bar. In this case text box replaces navigation bars label and does not let it show even if text box gets hidden.p  piOS 89  Swift Thank youp
