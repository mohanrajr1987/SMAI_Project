Positive 627 pIm trying to develop an app. In it user can input his friends name and birthday inluding hours and minutes. When its friends birthday, application should send a notification. First Ive tried to use timerTask to send a notification when needed, but it only sent it once, and only if time Ive input is the same means that timetask is working. But when I input at least 1 minute more, 1 minute later theres no notification. Same goes for handler.

Im calling a non static method from the inner class but the problem is the nonstatic method has an instance of database class which is also not static and my log shows gives null exception from accessing the database. I tried passing context but that also not solved the issue. p  precodepublic class AlarmServices extends Service       UserSQLiteDB dbHelper     Cursor cursor     String where  11       Override     public void onCreate           TODO Autogenerated method stub         super.onCreate         scheduleAlarm             public void CallMethodAfter           Log.vcall method after,yes         dbHelper  new UserSQLiteDBAlarmServices.this         dbHelper.open         cursor  dbHelper.getInCompleteAttendancewhere           Daily Attendance         int rows  cursor.getCount         if rows gt 0              cursor.moveToFirst              for int i  0 i lt rows i                  int Id                 String recvdate, ffcode, terrcode, drcode, drname, addr, createddate, ffmgr, shift, lat, lon,droidrefno,locAddress, syncstatus, currdate, dateonly                 Id  cursor.getInt0                 recvdate  cursor.getString1                 ffcode  cursor.getString2                 terrcode  cursor.getString3                 drcode  cursor.getString4                 drname  cursor.getString5                 addr  cursor.getString6                 createddate  cursor.getString7                 ffmgr  cursor.getString8                 shift  cursor.getString9                 lat  cursor.getString10                 lon  cursor.getString11                 droidrefno  cursor.getString12                 locAddress  cursor.getString13                 syncstatus  cursor.getString14                 currdate  cursor.getString15                 dateonly  cursor.getString16                   Sync Server                 ChkInsertDailyAttendanceOperation insertAttd  new ChkInsertDailyAttendanceOperationAlarmServices.this,                         recvdate, ffcode, terrcode, drcode, drname, addr,                         createddate, ffmgr,shift,Double.parseDoublelat,Double.parseDoublelon,locAddress,                         droidrefno,currdate,dateonly                   insertAttd.execute                   cursor.moveToNext                         else                       dbHelper.close             public void scheduleAlarm          AlarmManager amAlarmManagergetSystemServiceALARMSERVICE         Intent alarmintent1  new Intentthis, MyExtBroadcastReceiver.class         PendingIntent sender1PendingIntent.getBroadcastthis, 100, alarmintent1, PendingIntent.FLAGUPDATECURRENT  Intent.FILLINDATA          Calendar calCalendar.getInstance         cal.addCalendar.MINUTE,2         am.setRepeatingAlarmManager.RTCWAKEUP, cal.getTimeInMillis, 1000260, sender1         System.out.printlnalarm set...........           public static class MyExtBroadcastReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver           public MyExtBroadcastReceiver                super                    Override         public void onReceivefinal Context context, final Intent intent                       new AlarmServices.CallMethodAfter                    Override     public IBinder onBindIntent intent           TODO Return the communication channel to the service.         throw new UnsupportedOperationExceptionNot yet implemented       codepre

Positive 627 pI want to create a Single SignOn framework for Android where different independent apps may share one single codeaccountcode and codeaccountTypecode, respectively. Right now, all different apps use the exact same codeAccountAuthenticatorcode and codeAuthenticatorServicecode as described in the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.android.comtrainingsyncadapterscreatingauthenticator.html relnofollowAndroid Developer Docsa.p  pWhen I try updating one specific App with the respective codeAuthenticatorServicecode the service doesnt get updated in the Android OS, i.e. still the old service is used regardless which app I use. I think this is due to the fact that the codeaccountTypecode is still bound to the old codeAuthenticatorServicecode from an app that has not been updated right now.p  pMy Question ist now How can I prioritize the newly installed codeAuthenticatorServicecode making it responsible for all accounts of the respective codeaccountTypecode even though there are still apps with the old codeAuthenticatorServicecode installed. p  pBackground I cannot update all apps at the same time but still need to make sure that apps can use the new codeAuthenticatorServicecode as soon as they get updatedp  pThank you in advancep

Positive 627 pI have several services that run correctly 99.9 of the time. However, they work with network and database and occasionally an error that I have not anticipated makes it into the code and causes the service to crash. In this instance, restarting the service usually fixes the problem.p  pMy service creates a new thread where the main code is run. I have added error handling to the service class that catches and logs any unhandled exceptions from this thread. What I am wondering is if I can call OnStop and then OnStart from the service class to restart my servicep  pThe code that I am using is in located in the same class as OnStart and OnStop.

Negative 627 pIm developing a relatively small application to talk to PostgreSQL, and wanted to get some feedback on how far is too far to go with regards to protecting against SQL injection.p  pThe application is in Perl and does not use any ORM modules just DBI.  The SQL statements are constructed in the typical fashion with placeholdersp  precodemy sql  SELECT  FROM cfggttablename WHERE foo   my sth  dbhgtpreparesql sthgtexecutebar codepre  pThe reason the tablename is interpolated is that the application has to perform the same operation against multiple tables, all of which have a column foo.p  pUsing the  placeholder protects against most of the simple SQL injection attacks.  My question is around the tablename, which you cant use a placeholder for.  The table comes from the config file, but the app supports a configfile switch to use an alternate config file.p  pThe database credentials are stored in the config file.  So if an attacker could craft a config file or replace the default one with one in which cfgtablename was replaced with something malicious, then the application could be tricked into running the malicious code.p  pFor an attacker to do this, theyd have to have valid database credentials already, otherwise the application wouldnt connect.  If they have credentials, then they can just craft their own code using DBI or use the psql cli to do something malicious.p  pI see two possible ways to protect against thisp  ul liswitch to an ORM, in which case Id be doing something on the order of ormgetclassfortablecfgtablenameli liuse a regex to sanitize the tablename before preparing the SQL statementli liuse dbhquoteidentifierli ul  pObviously the second way is the cheap and cheerful one.  But given the statement about credentials above, are either of these approaches really warranted  How much effort is too much when it comes to forcing the attacker to just use an alternate attack vector as opposed to effort that actually prevents the attackp

I havent had much luck with their documentation and I have tried to use some of the inherit features like the GridViewSelectColumn property which generates a checkbox in a column but I havent had any luck invoking commands when a checkbox is selectedchecked. Instead of the checkbox should I look to use a button and add that as a stand alone column that the user can click such as                br    p  pIf anyone can provide a code sample of how to invoke the selection of one row of data as well as how to disable the seletion of additional rows once a single row has been selected I would appreciate it. For the disabling I  assume that the CanUserSelect property needs to be set to false once an item has been selected but I have yet to successfully been able to invoke anything using the GridViewSelectColumn.p  pAny samples or points of reference would be appreciated.p  pThank youp

Negative 627 pIm trying to create a UserControl that contains a AutoCompleteBox. I want to use the SelectedItem property of this AutoCompleteBox to populate other UserControls with information based on which item the User selected. To prevent the SelectedItem to be fired every time a user navigate between items in the dropdown Ive created a EventToCommand that executes on DropDownClosed event like thisp  pp  pThe command is of type  public RelayCommand SelectedItemCommand  get private set p  pThis works fine except for when a user start typing something that has a match at the beginning, but if the user continue typing and there is no match anymore, then the DropDown is closed and no item is actually selected.

Negative 627 pI am using DirectoryServices and the WinNT provider to connect to a remote computer.  I then check some group membership information and possibly add or remove a domain user from a specified local group.p  pI have been able to get all of this code working without a hitch using a vb.net console application and when communicating with my local box, or with any box where the account I am logged in under has administrative rights.p  pCodep  precode    string strUserPath  WinNTDomainNamesomeuser,user     DirectoryEntry deComputer  new DirectoryEntryWinNT  Computername  ,computer     deComputer.RefreshCache     DirectoryEntry deGroup  deComputer.Children.Findadministrators, group      IEnumerable members  deGroup.Invokemembers, null     ListltDirectoryEntrygt r  new ListltDirectoryEntrygt      foreach object o in members              DirectoryEntry deMember  new DirectoryEntryo          r.AdddeMember           deGroup.InvokeAdd, strUserPath     deGroup.CommitChanges      deGroup.InvokeRemove, strUserPath     deGroup.CommitChanges codepre  pSo I moved the code to an ASP.Net web app, which is impersonating a service account through the Impersonate section of web.config.  The account I am impersonating does not have admin rights on any of the workstations so I put in a usernamepassword into the constructor for the computer entry like sop  precodeDirectoryEntry deComputer  new DirectoryEntryWinNT  Computername  ,computer, username, password codepre  pThe username is that of a domain account which has local admin rights on every workstation.  If I look at the Username property of the resulting deComputer object I can see that the username matches what I entered.  Also if I enter in an invalid password it throws an error, so it is authenticating in some fashion.p  pHowever if I now try and add or remove a user from a remote workstation I get a general access denied error.  If I add the service account that ASP.Net is using as a local admin on that workstation it will add and remove no problem.p  pSo next I tried using the LogonAPI advapi32.dll LogonUser call to login as the user account that is a local admin on all workstations, impersonated the resulting WindowsIdentitiy and tried running just the original deComputer instantiation.  When I do this every property, excepty Path, returns an OLE exception...p  pIm pretty lost here on what to try next.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.p  pstrongWorkaroundstrongp  pTo work around the issue we created a windows service that runs under the local admin account and thus doesnt have any issues running the code.  We push all of our updates to a table in a SQL database and the service picks them up and processes them.  BUT, I still really would like to know why this doesnt work, and it would be nice to push updates straight from the web site.p
Negative 627 pIm new to ZF and Im discovering how to use ZendForm and utilize its capability like validating and filtering input values. I already know the basic of Zendform like building a form and add element into it. My problem is that I want to add a custom error message to form element and I want to define that message inside the action controller that instantiated the form. I want to defined the error message inside the controller because I need to perform a validation against the database. For example checking if the usernameemail already exist in the database. I tried googling and thats leads me to setErrorMessage method of zendform but when I try to use it, the error message is not showing at all... I also tried zendformsetError and still no error displaying in the view script. Is my idea of setting custom error in the action controller correct or this should be done the other wayp

Negative 627 pI have a FrameView thats created in my XML layout, and in my code, Im trying to create a series of new ImageViews and add them as children of this FrameView.  The ImageViews are small, only about 15 pixels square, and I want them to show up in various positions around the FrameView Im trying to implement what looks like a radar screen.  Im able to create them and add them just fine, and they show up on the screen.  However, when I try to set their margins, it doesnt seem to have any effect.  No matter what I set, all the ImageViews show up in the top left corner of the FrameView, as opposed to offset by the appropriate margins.  My XML layout is listed below, along with the code that generates the child views.  Am I doing something wrong  How can I get the margins to show up properly  Or is there a better way to do this than by using margins.p  pXMLp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltLinearLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid   androidididRadarBackground   androidorientationvertical   androidlayoutwidthfillparent   androidlayoutheightfillparent   androidbackgrounddrawableradarbggt  ltFrameLayout     androidididRadarFrame     androidlayoutwidth320dip     androidlayoutheight320dip     androidlayoutmarginTop25dipgt  ltFrameLayoutgt ltLinearLayoutgt codepre  pJavap  precodefor int i  0 i lt getData.getTargetCount i    int id  getData.getTargetIdi  Log.dT.TAGA, Radar plotting target   id  TargetView tv  new TargetViewthis, id, getData.getTargetNameid  FrameLayout.LayoutParams lp  new FrameLayout.LayoutParams    LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT, LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT  lp.setMargins    radarCenterX  int getData.calcTargetRadarXid, radarSize  radarScale  targetSizeX  2,     radarCenterY  int getData.calcTargetRadarYid, radarSize  radarScale  targetSizeY  2,     0, 0  tv.setImageResourceR.drawable.radarcivilian  tv.setOnClickListenerthis  mTargets.addtv  mFrame.addViewtv, lp  codepre

Having nondistinct documents it seems would cause them to become massive over timep  pWhen viewing a page that lists all the codePostscode I want to display the codeAuthorcode name no big deal and the codeAuthorcode post count. Here is where Im stuck.p  pI can store the codeAuthorcode name in the post as its unlikely to change, however the codeAuthorcode post count is going to constantly change, so this cannot be stored within the codePostcode.p  pSo now if Im displaying a page with 50 posts, I need to perform the relational equivalent of a join to get the current codeAuthorcode post count.

Negative 627 pMy goal is to have a strict parsing and forbid dates like 9899 for example. However, the following code raises a codejava.text.ParseExceptioncode with the message emUnparseable date 9801emp  precodeSimpleDateFormat sdf  new SimpleDateFormatyyww sdf.setLenientfalse sdf.parse9801 codepre  pThis is indeed for the a hrefhttpwww.timeanddate.comcalendarmonthly.htmlyear1998ampmonth1ampcountry5 relnofollowfirst week of 1998a, which starts on a Thursday. However, the parsing of a week always returns the date of the strongfirst daystrong of this week. In that case, it would be em12291997em. And this is why an exception is raised.p  pIt seems this problem comes from the codeGregorianCalendarcode class and more specifically from the codecomputeTimecode method which checks if the original fields match the fields externally set when the parsing is strongnot lenientstrongp  precodeif isLenient    for int field  0 field lt FIELDCOUNT field      if isExternallySetfield        continue           if originalFields[field]  internalGetfield         Restore the original field values       System.arraycopyoriginalFields, 0, fields, 0, fields.length       throw new IllegalArgumentExceptiongetFieldNamefield          codepre  pIs this a bug I think parsing em199801em should indeed return em12291997em and not raise any exception. However, do you know how to make the parsing returns em01011998em instead which would be the first day of the week in the specified yearp

Negative 627 pI am using Apache Shiro as my security layer in my Spring app and I am encountering a really weird situation.p  pFirstly, this is how my security system is set up. When a user registers their password is hashed with a securely generated random salt. The salt and hashed password are then stored in my DB. Everything works 100 when they register and login works great too, but then a couple of days go by and suddenly their hashed passwords arent matching any longer. Here is my codep  precodeimport org.apache.shiro.codec.Base64 import org.apache.shiro.crypto.hash.Sha256Hash  public static void mainString[] args          String plainPassword  testing         String salt  8AFTpriREtydSg3937rQHNRyvZLuXqyXYgWXI55f1PbhbUQSeFGCLKsHpA6thZKs3uQeNNJHksqcV5oaNcr9lQiXMMyC8Duqr2aQaqyjLKpNMVlB69jJ7emNq0K6ccfBdvO4JGT2U689LeNg6CqN9kqW2GBgT2CIVOlapA34          System.out.printlnnew Sha256HashplainPassword.toCharArray, Base64.decodesalt, 1024.toBase64  codepre  pThe resulting hashed password isp  precodeb8VLteKV8F5kwDjRgdkMPAvQC8sk7Ooflt91juaXA  codepre  pBut the password I have in my database, which was working and was generated with the exact same salt a couple of days ago wasp  precodexZNBNlUa8vRQq0qY5bbkETzZtzztGRTH2KZKijQdilU codepre  pSo as you can imagine, I am completely stumped. Does anyone know if I am doing something wrong Or if I have left a step out.p  pUpdate 1 After registering a new user in my system, it looks like all the other users in the system have their passwords changed for some reason. So this has nothing to do with the way the password hash is generated and more to do with my database access layer.p

Furthermore, the onSessionEnd also writes to the log file when I take out the invocation of the component.  In other words if I just tell it to write Session ended. to the log file I will see it in the log file. I have set current session timeout in CF Administrator and my app.cfc for 3 minutes for testing.p  pIf I call the giveMeAnswer method in the jobState.cfc from a separate file also at the root level the giveMeAnswer method works properly and returns the value I am a CFC.p  pIf I move the jobState.cfc to the root level and set the component attribute to jobState I am also getting a return from the component.p  precodelt Runs when your session starts gt ltcffunction nameonSessionStart returnTypevoid outputfalsegt  lt  invoke all session variables  moved out of on session start   gt ltcfinvoke componentapplication.virtualPaths.cfcPathsystemsessionVars methodinit gt  ltcflog fileThis.Name typeInformation textSession started.gt  ltcffunctiongt  lt Runs when session times out gt  ltcffunction nameonSessionEnd returntypevoidgt ltcfargument nameSessionScope typestruct requiredtrue gt ltcfargument nameApplicationScope typestruct requiredtrue gt  ltcfinvoke componentlibcomponentsjobState methodgiveMeAnswer returnvariablereturnFromCfcgt ltcfinvokegt  ltcflog fileThis.Name typeInformation textSession ended.  returnFromCfcgt  ltcfreturn gt ltcffunctiongt codepre  pSo, is it just not finding the component  Any other ideasp  pThanks much, Jerryp

Negative 627 pIm trying to use a codeJButtoncode as codeTableCellRenderercode and codeTableCellEditorcode for my codeJTablecode. In my test scenario I have 5 rows which each shows a codeJButtoncode as Renderer and Editor different button instances for editor and renderer. When I click on one button for the first time codeactionPerformedcode of the editorbutton is invoked, when I RELEASE the mouse button. When I click on another button in another row then, the codeactionPerformedcodeEvent of the editorbutton is already invoked, when I put the mouse button down codeMOUSEPRESSEDcode. This behaviour doesnt seem right. Usually the codeactionPerformedcodeevent is invoked when releasing the mouse button, not when pressing it. When pressing another button in another row afterwards, codeactionPerformedcode is again invoked correctly when releasing the mouse button, on the next button click in another row codeactionPerformedcode is again incorrectly invoked on codeMOUSEDOWNcode and so forth.p  pWhen moving the focus out of the table and then clicking on a button, codeactionPerformedcode is invoked correctly when releasing the mouse button. Also when the table row editor in the row the button to be clicked is in is first focused activated and then the button is clicked, the behaviour also is correct. Then only situation when it doesnt work is when a table cell editor is active and then the button in another table row is clicked.p  pComparing the stacktraces when codeactionPerformedcode is invoked in both cases I found out that in the incorrect case codeDefaultKeyboardFocusManagerKeyboardFocusManager.redispatchEventcode and codeBasicButtonListener.focusLostFocusEventcode are invoked, which both look suspicious to me.p  pHere is a little demonstration code for my problemp  precodeimport java.awt.Component import java.awt.Dimension import java.awt.GridLayout import java.awt.event.ActionEvent import java.awt.event.ActionListener  import javax.swing.AbstractCellEditor import javax.swing.JButton import javax.swing.JFrame import javax.swing.JPanel import javax.swing.JTable import javax.swing.table.AbstractTableModel import javax.swing.table.TableCellEditor import javax.swing.table.TableCellRenderer  public class TableButtonTest extends JFrame       private JTable  table      public TableButtonTest              superTableButtonTest          setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE          JPanel contentPane  new JPanelnew GridLayout1, 0         contentPane.setOpaquetrue         setContentPanecontentPane          table  new JTablenew MyTableModel         table.setPreferredScrollableViewportSizenew Dimension500, 70         addtable          setPreferredSizenew Dimension600, 200          TableCellRenderer defaultBtnRenderer  new TableCellRenderer                      private JButton btn  new JButtonaa              public Component getTableCellRendererComponentJTable table, Object value,                 boolean isSelected, boolean hasFocus, int row, int column                              return btn                                table.getColumnModel.getColumn0.setCellRendererdefaultBtnRenderer         table.getColumnModel.getColumn0.setCellEditornew ButtonEditor          pack         setVisibletrue            public class ButtonEditor extends AbstractCellEditor implements TableCellEditor              private JButton btn  new JButtonbb                      btn.addActionListenernew ActionListener                               public void actionPerformedActionEvent e                                      System.out.printlnBUTTON EVENT                                                 public Component getTableCellEditorComponentJTable table, Object value, boolean isSelected,             int row, int column                      return btn                   public Object getCellEditorValue                      return null                    class MyTableModel extends AbstractTableModel              public int getColumnCount                      return 1                   public int getRowCount                      return 5                   public Object getValueAtint row, int col                      return null                   Override         public boolean isCellEditableint row, int col                      return true                    public static void mainString[] args              new TableButtonTest       codepre  pWhen you start the program and hit any of the aa buttons, it turns to bb indicating that the editor is shown instead of the renderer and when you release the mouse button BUTTON EVENT is printed on STDOUT. If you click on another button in another row then, it also turns to bb but BUTTON EVENT is already printed to STDOUT before you release the mouse button. And also the focus rectangle around the button text isnt shown.p  pI tested this behaviour with Java 1.6.026 and 1.6.027. When I used 1.5.017 it got event worse When clicking on the second button NO actionPerformed was invoked, only the bbbutton was shown. The third click then again worked correctly, the fourth didnt and so forth. So the difference to Java 1.6 is, that on 1.6 on the second and fourth, ... click actionPerformed is invoked when releasing the mouse button, on 1.5 is isnt invoked at all.p  pBut I dont care about 1.5, I just want it to work with 1.6.p  pWhat can I do to make this workp  pThanks.p

Negative 627 pI need to initiate 1000s of emclientem connections in a single process, the key limitation I need to work around is the driver does not support ConnectEx, so I cannot have a pure IOCP solution. p  pMy first thought was a thread pool to handle connections, where each handle can handle up to 64 connections using plain connectionselect semantics, and once connected continue with IOCP. But this cannot work once select is running I cant add another socket to the FDSET.

Negative 627 pI have created an Html 5 page that provides important serverside functionality.  Unfortunately, it must be run in an Html 5 browser Chrome, IE9, or Firefox with a canvas to produce the results I need.  It is completely self contained, taking needed parameters through the URL, and is ready to be closed when the OnLoad event is ready to send.  So far so good.p  pThe following process needs to be automated no human eyes or interaction and will be run from within a web service not run from within a browser.  Ideally, I dont want to waste extra cycles with busy wait, or delay the result by waiting for long time periods simply hoping the process has finished.  I need top  ol liOpen a browser preferably Chrome with a URL, using C. li liWait for the page to completely finish loading  ideally receiving a callback of some kind.li liClose the browser page when finished, again with C.li ol  pWeve tried using IE9.  There is C support to launch IE9, Wait until not Busy, and gracefully Close the browser however, the page loads resources asynchronously there is no way around this, and so we get the signal that it is no longer busy during the resource load  instead of when the page has finished.  Adding busy wait would consume valuable serverside cpu cycles.p  pA simple Create Process call would be nice, but would only work if the browser could close itself with some html  but thanks to security measures in the browsers, I cant find a reliable way to use html commands to close a browser that was launched from commandline I did see you can close tabs spawned from an already opened page  firefox only, but this doesnt help.p  pDoes anyone know how I can accomplish this goal  Again  there is no human involvement in any of the process, no human eyes will ever see the page or interact with it in any way.  The page only runs on the server machine, and will never be deployed to a client machine. p

When I insert the records into the other table I delete the original records,those not updated, I change the batch number on those that are not updated and need to release the lock.p  pI use the readpast in order that no records already selected will appear for other useres. I believe that is right.p  pIf this is correct I need to know how to release the records. I am new to C so please make it clear and be patient.p

Negative 627 pI have a website with a lot of pictures in it.

However, when I do this the pictures are displayed alphabetically which I dont want.  I want them to be displayed my insertion time.  Which I was thinking I could create a table with a number field set to auto increment and then the file name of the inserted picture.  and just leave the pictures on the server.  So everytime I insert a picture it will insert a row with a number and file name.  So when I display I just display by that number Desc, which should give me the pictures by newest inserted.  Is this the best way to do thisp  pThanksp

Negative 627 pIm implementing an app for AndroidAPI 10. I have few designs for tabletsupposedly and for mobile phone. Regarding the previous sentence it might sound a bit stupid in my opinion layouts should be picked according to devices physical size  not resolution, otherwise there might be a phone with high resolution that renders, say, a grid of 5x5, in rather confusing, inadequately smallsized way. In order to provide division by physical size I gotta use emreslayoutem folders. Agreed p  pAlso Im a bit confused about a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidepracticesscreenssupport.html relnofollowmultiplescreensa guides definition on physical size. Would you mind explaining what physical size is in terms of Android mean, strongwhat its measured instrong Is there any strongcorrelation with dpistrong p  pThanks.p

Negative 627 pI have a method, inside a TryCatch block, which calls a Hibernate DB Save operation to insert a row.p  pThe method completes successfully even though there are DB problems e.g. when I insert a NULL into a nonNULL column.

Negative 627 pI have a program Ive written in Python 2.7 on Windows, and Ive been using py2exe with total success to make it into an exe and associated files.

Ive looked thoroughly into py2installer, py2app, freeze and others, but if I understand correctly I am new to Python and emveryem new to compiling you need to run them on the system you want to compile them for, i.e. you can only compile for Linux on Linux and OSX on OSX.

Negative 627 pSo were developing a web application in Symfony2 brief editorial Symfony2 is freaking awesome along the lines of an SOA.  All data is farted back and forth between our jQuery powered frontend and the Symfony2 backend formatted a la JSON, and therein lies the rub.p  pSymfony2 provides for a robust security system, but it seems to hinge on the Security Layer intercepting form submissions and using the formencoded POST data to process an authentication attempt.  This is problematic for our application because we use JSON exclusively.  From where Im standing, using JSON for every single request and response emexceptem authentication is... the sheet of the bool, frankly.  Bad smell, bad juju, whatever you call it.  p  pNow, Symfony2 allows for the creation of event listeners that hook into a series of events related to the lifecycle of a request and the consumate response.  We use one of these hooks to decode the JSON that comes in with every POST request so that the relevant controller only ever has to worry about working directly with a php array and not do any decoding or deserializing or whatever.  p  pSo the crux of our issue is that the Security Layer expects that formencoded POST data that it gets from a form submission generally on a page that the backend served in the first place.  Were set up to feed it a PHP array created from JSONified data.  So what do  Should wep  ul liCreate a custom authentication service that is built to deal with an array made from le JSONli liTweak our request hook to check the target uri of each request and subsequently massage the requests JSON into the formencoded string the Security Layer expectsli liTweak the Security Layer so that it can work the the JSON turned php arrayli ul

The problem starts when there are differing number of records for a POID in Table 2 and Table 3.p  pBefore Table 3 was added to the report, I grouped the report on the Table 1 POID and put the Table 2 record information in the Details section of the report. However, now that I have inserted the Table 3 records, the Table 2 and Table 3 records keep duplicating.p  pFor example for POID  1001 there is one Table 1 record, three Table 2 records, and two Table 3 records. So, the outcome on the report is that each Table 2 record is repeated twice and each Table 3 record is repeated three times.p  pI dont want them to repeat themselves. I want them to display as they are on database.p  pI have used the POID group all of the table data using C, VS2010, and SQLExpress2008.p  pI hope this is clear and that you can help. Thanks in advance.p  pNote I did research a lot for this problem and then finally, asked here.p

Negative 627 pSome issue with latest apps software key. The problem is that it seems Android opens the application with latest intent used to open that application. A problem would be if the user opened the application from a PendingIntent from a notification which popsoff and does some action specific to that notification. Then when opening the application again from most used it does same actions as for notification case may not be intended.p  pA workaround I can think of is to associate the notification with an ID or other info and keep it persisted. When opening the app from notification we use a specific Intent action for that case we check if we have that ID and if so, remove it and were done. Next time when we open the application even if we have the notification action we dont care since the ID is no longer persisted.p  pIs there any better solution for this case How do we know if the user opened the app from most usedp

Negative 627 pI am developing an application as a college project. Its almost complete, with most features working properly. p  pThe application records visitor information and prints a visitor badge for each visitor.  The visitor enters their information into the system through a user friendly interface, on completion a visitor badge is automatically printed and their details are saved to a database. p  pThis all works great Weve already gotten our grades and we got top marks, couldnt be happierp  pHowever, the printer options on the admin screen are quite limited for the label printer.  On the admin screen you can search the database and print the results using the typical print dialogue, or you can save the data to a comma delimited CSV file. p  pAll good But as the label printer only operates from the front end of the program, where there is no print dialogue available, I need to provide access to the printer options on the admin screen then save them for use later when the label printer is in operation.  At the moment we have the ability to select what printer will be used to print the visitor badges, and we can set and save the page setup information from the admin page  but I cannot figure out how to access the printer setup options to provide access to the administrators without using the print dialogue. p  pAnyone advice would be greatly appreciated. p

Negative 627 pHi guys so Im using a custom membership provider and custom role provider. And it is logging in using these correctly. I also implemented my own Membership user object so that I can gain access to other user information, and I dont need to load all the data everytime I change page, but I currently cannot get this to work properly. Below is my user objectp  precodepublic class User  MembershipUser      [RequiredErrorMessage  Username cannot be blank]     [DisplayName  User name]     public string UserName  get set       [RequiredErrorMessage  Password cannot be blank]     [DataTypeDataType.Password]     [DisplayName  Password]     public string Password  get set       [DisplayName  User ID]     public long UserID  get set       [DisplayName  Family Name]     [StringLength50, ErrorMessage  Family name cannot be longer than 50 characters]     public string FamilyName  get set       [DisplayName  Given Name]     [StringLength50, ErrorMessage  Given name cannot be longer than 50 characters]     public string GivenName  get set       public Company Company  get set       public virtual IIdentity Identity  get set   codepre  pAnd when the user logs in I call the following login methodp  precode    [AllowAnonymous]     [HttpPost]     public ActionResult LoginUser model, string returnUrl              FormsAuthentication.SignOut         ifMembership.ValidateUsermodel.UserName, model.Password                      FormsAuthentication.SetAuthCookiemodel.UserName, true             return RedirectToActionIndex,                   ViewBag.Message  Failed to login         return View      codepre  pBut when I call codeHttpContext.Usercode in index it just contains nameID, not the rest of my user object. Do I need to create a custom codeFormAuthenticationcode object Or is it standard process to store all this user information inside the codeHttpContext.Sessioncode object Or get my user to extend the codeSystem.Security.Principle.IPrinciplecode Or even in the codeController.TempDatacode Or somewhere else Im not familiar with. I dont want to have to hit the database everytime to load the user data.p  pSorry if these are obvious questions Im fairly new to web development and not sure what the generic way of doing these things are.

Negative 627 pI want to be able to read from a real live proper MySQL database using standard file access routines. I dont mean reading the MySQL databases own underlying private files. What I mean is implementing a filebased linux device driver that presents a MySQL database as a file. In other words,  the text file is a View of the MySQL database. The MySQL records are presented in our homegrown custom variation of the CSV format that the legacy code was originally written to understand.p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pI have some legacy code that reads from a text file that contains a very large table of data, each line being a separate record. New records lines need to be added but there is contention for the file among the team, there is also an overhead in deployment of the legacy code and this file to many systems when releasing the software to them. The text file itself also needs to be version controlled.p  pRather than modify the legacy code to call a MYSQL database version of these records directly, I thought it would be better to leave it untouched. This would avoid risks in modifying the code and ease deployment and moreover, modifying the code would cause much overhead in derisking, design discussions, more testing etc.p  pSo what Im looking to do is write a filebased device driver such that this makes the MySQL database appear as a file to the legacy code, with the data within the format that the legacy code expects. That way the legacy code is not changed and can work oblivious that the file is really an underlying database. Contention is removed because the individual records in the database can now be updatedadded to separately via MySQL, or even better a separate web admin interface that guides and validates data entry from the user for individual records and deployment effort is much reduced without having to upissue the whole file on all the systems that use it.p  pThe device driver would contain routines to internally translate standard file read operations into MySQL queries to the MySQL database and contain routines to return the MySQL results and translate these into the text format for returning back to the file read operation.p  pThis is for a LinuxUnix platform.p  pHas this been done and what are your thoughtsp  pcleaned up the question, grammar, clarification, readability. This does not affect the accepted answer.p

Or if you are feeling especially generous, you can download my free browser source example. a hrefhttpssites.google.comsiteinfiniteopensyntaxbasicwebbrowser relnofollowhttpssites.google.comsiteinfiniteopensyntaxbasicwebbrowsera p  pThat source shows how my own app is pretty much set up. If you would like to implement the NSPageController on that app and send me the source, I would really appreciate it. Its not much, but if you do that Ill add the swiping example to Infinite Open Syntax and put your name on it. You can choose the license. p  pThis is Cocoa, not Cocoa Touchp  pemstrongEDITemstrongp  pOkay, now I just need to make sure the app still works on Snow Leopard.

Negative 627 pHeres the simplest of scenarios. I have a Form with a few TextBoxes and a BindingSource, bound to a DataSet instance, and the TextBoxes bound to the BindingSource.

Negative 627 pstrongtldrstrong  emsprite animation on mouseover done, rewind animation on mouseleave done, disable hover while animation is playing.needs solvingem  stronga hrefhttpjsfiddle.net8nFu51 relnofollowFIDDLE with meastrongp  pI have a rather specific problem with my menu and since my knowledge of javascript is limited at best I thought you could help me. I wanted to have an animation playing while the user hovers over it and have it return to its original state when the mouse leaves the button. While I got this working with the help of a script called spritely I ran into a usability problem. p  pThe code will register multiple mouseovers even while the animation is playing. This leads to strange behaviour where the animation would freeze at certain frames. p  pI tried to counter this with codehoverIntentcode, a script that tries to guess the users intent and only calls the code.hovercode if he moves the mouse a set amount of pixels in an interval. This works fine for certain bugs, but kills the interactivity and with that, the purpose of the animation.p  pI thought about a variable counting down from 1000ms to 1ms and tie the functions to this variable but failed miserably.p  pSince I really want this to work, I turn to you, hivemind. In a nutshell I want to have the button not register any code.hovercode for around a second codeendAnimationDelaycode until the Animation is finished.

Negative 627 pI am using the Drag amp Drop APIs introduced in 3.0  however, I only want the drag shadow to follow the users finger around while they are inside one particular area of the screen.

Negative 627 pI will try my best to explain my issue.p  pI have a SQLite3 database file of about 50,000 records that I compiled and use in my app. This database is read only and is only used to query and pull data from.

Negative 627 pSo I have a directory where a bunch of configuration files are stored, but now I also have several sub directories which also contain config files.

Negative 627 pstrongEditstrong  Abstract My problem here is that when I run a list of four data frames through a nested for loop which works correctly and is doing what I need it to do I can only get the output into three columns of a matrix when I would prefer to have a single column for each parameter of my inner for loop. Im thinking that the loops are creating a column for each item on the list please see output below because when I try to store the output as just single columns I get this error incorrect number of dimensions. The reason that I need the data in columns rather than storing it in a whole matrix that was created outside the loop is because in the future I will be running different files and will not know the amount of rows that will be generated by the loops. I really would appreciate help with this, Im still finding it difficult to understand how to get certain outputs from loops, although believe me, its not from lack of trying.p  pThis may be a very easy problem to solve, but the answer has eluded me. I have nested for loops and my input is a list of four data frames although this number could and will vary with different data sets. It is important that my input stay a list. So far Ive created matrices to store these outputs, and the outputs end up going into three separate columns of the matrices, Im assuming thats because its one column for each item on the list I know I said four items on the list, but the code only ends up making changes to three out of the four items on the list.p  precodeLAT lt matrixdataNA, nrow50, ncol5 Matrices to store the output in LON lt matrixdataNA, nrow50, ncol5 but ideally these would be columns LON lt c Impute lt matrixdataNA, nrow50, ncol5 ID lt matrixdataNA, nrow50, ncol5  for i in 1lengthsubM.List    Looping through each submatrix in the list i loops through each submatrix on list   for j in 2nrowsubM.List[[i]]  Loop through each row of each submatrix in the list j loops through each row on each submatrix     if subM.List[[i]][j, LAT]  180 amp if there is a 180 and a value greater than 0 in activityIN, break the inner for loop       subM.List[[i]][j1, ACTIVITYIN]   0  Will break if it find a 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, or 4.   break   else if subM.List[[i]][j, LAT]  180 amp            subM.List[[i]][j, ACTIVITYIN]   0    ID[j,i] lt subM.List[[i]][j,ID] Imputation 1, imputing data points with 0 activity intensity and 180 for LON   LAT[j,i] lt subM.List[[i]][j,LAT]  subM.List[[i]][j1,LAT]   LON[j,i] lt subM.List[[i]][j,LON]  subM.List[[i]][j1,LON]   Impute[j,i] lt subM.List[[i]][j,Impute]  1 populates the impute column.

Also, I just want only the numeric outputs, the items that have actually been changed by going through the loops, with none of the NAs included although I realize that right now most of the NAs are from my matrix dimensions.

User referenced by one of those tables Sure, you can pass. However lets say I have to have more complex access rules. Its likely they might simply not be doable with one simple query.li liIts hard to tell if the user requested an unauthorized row OR if the row is authorized but doesnt actually exist, so that makes error reporting tricky. You wouldnt know if you should report a 200 or a 403 although depending on the type of API you might want to always use 200 in these cases to prevent exposing too much information to an attacker.li ul  pThe other option I see is to strongmake extra queries before or after the factstrong to validate the data is indeed accessible to that user. E.g. get list of ids of cars the sales person is authorized to get and THEN perform the query on that subset, or the exact other way around.p  pThe upside is obviously that I can make more calls and run more logic in the business layer and be as sophisticated as I want.p  pThe downside is that I will be generating more DB traffic which could be a dealbreaker depending on how frequent that request is made.p  pstrongIm probably missing a few other options here, and Id love to hear how youve solved the problem before.

Negative 627 pI have set up an ec2 machine to run an app. To make my deployment script work, I need my deployment user ec2user to have write access to certain directories. I am not versed in linuxunix commands. I am finding my way around using Google.p  pSo the directory in question is homeec2userucsocialserverreleases. The directory was created by a Capistrano script and for whatever reason it made root the owner of the releases directory even though the script was being run as the ec2user. An ls l shows that the root is the owner and that both the owner and group have rwx access img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comZSHBU.png altenter image description herep  pMy script is failing because it is trying to write to the releases directory as ec2user but does not have the permission.p  pI figured if I create a group called deployers and added both root and ec2user to this group, ec2user will then have rwx permissions to this directory since ec2user will belong to same group as root and the group permissions to this directory are rwx. But that did not work.p  pShould that have worked If not why my understanding of the group permission may be totally wrongp  pHow can I give ec2user rwx access to this directorp  pThanks.p
Negative 627 pI am trying to use a dialog element on my page, but I am having some issues.  It would appear that the box itself is not showing up.  I have an iframe inside the dialog that is working properly aside from some sizing issues, but the title bar of the box and sometimes the buttons are not shown.  I have seen online that the cause of this is typically that the JQuery UI css file is not included, but I dont think that is the problem here, as I have the link, which was copied from another page that is creating dialog boxes properly.  I cant decide if it is relevant or not, but I am creating the pages in SharePoint Designer, and it is using two different standards to evaluate the pages, one of which the nonworking one claims that the codeltlinkgtcode tag is an error, saying that In XHTML 1.0 Strict the  tag cannot contain a .  However, there is no codeltdivgtcode around the codeltlinkgtcode tag, and the designer also says that many of the SharePointcreated tabs named codeltSharePoint...gtcode are not allowed in this version of XHTML.

Negative 627 pIm in the midst of upgrading my Rails app from 2.3 to 3.2, but Im stuck on 3.1 at the moment.p  pIm currently struggling with converting references to image filenames into a syntax that works with the asset pipeline.

Negative 627 pWe have several graphs that show filtered data from surface EMG sensors. This data is received over TCP and propagated using an event. The datapackets are of type DataPackets and are as such filtered out. Im using a buffer to let packets pass through at 30FPS. Im listening to this event using Reactive Extensions as followsp  pre classlangcs prettyprintoverridecodeObservable.FromEventltPacketgth gt this.DataService.PacketReceived  h, hgt this.DataService.PacketReceived  h           .OfTypeltDataPacketgt           .BufferTimeSpan.FromSeconds1.0  30           .ObserveOnDispatcher           .Subscribe               packet gt this.ReceiveDataPacketspacket.ToList,               err gt this.Log.ErrorError subscribing to data packets, err,                gt this.Log.InfoFinished listening to data packets codepre  pTo display the EMG data we use the Telerik ChartView. The problem Im having is that data update is not smooth, the graph is choppy.p  pThere are probably several reasons for thisp  ol liTelerik chart is not fast enough for 1000 data points per secondli liDispatcherTimer does not fire at a constant rateli lidata is not received at a constant rateli ol  pPoint 1 is solved by sampling the input data so that only 1000 points are visible in the graph.p  pPoint 2 cannot be solved unfortunately. I tried raising the priority to Render but this does not help at all. a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUS5eea67001c794da69b68efa480ed3a36simplifywpfdispatchercallsforumrx relnofollowhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsenUS5eea67001c794da69b68efa480ed3a36simplifywpfdispatchercallsforumrxap  pPoint 3 is related to point 2. I try to solve both with a timed queue using codeSystem.Debug.Stopwatchcode. DataPackets contain a timestamp and this is used to let them through at a constant rate on the Dispatcher thread. I suspect that this will not help much since the DispatcherRate is not linked to refresh rate of the renderthread.p  pWhat can I do to reduce choppiness I tried LightningChart Ultimate which is supposed to be much much faster. It does indeed have much better performance and there is no need to do any sampling, it can render each and every datapoint. The samples provided with LightningChart run butter smooth, but they read their data in the main thread. When I implement their chart in our multithreaded program it still suffers from a combination of point 2 and 3 and the fact that it is much more expensive than the Telerik chartview.p  p[Update]p  pClassic mistake. My datasource was using a DispatcherTimer to gather data. Changing this to an Observable.Interval massively increased performance.p

Negative 627 pThe question might emseemem stupidtrivial and might be, but I simply cannot understand how to achieve my goal. Sorry if the title is misguiding, couldnt think of a better onep  pI have a webpage on a App Engine server which uses GWT. I got client code and server code. The client code can call RPC methods without any problem my problem has emnothingem to do with the gwtclient at all.p  pI got the following classesp  precodeMyClassService.java  client package RemoteServiceRelativePathmyService public interface MyClassService extends RemoteService    public doSomething   MyClassServiceAsync.java  client package public interface MyClassServiceAsync    public void doSomethingAsyncCallbackltVoidgt callback   MyClassServiceImpl.java  server package public class MyClassServiceImpl extends RemoteServiceServlet implements MyClassService    Override    public void doSomething           does something      codepre  pA scenario and what I want to do Ive got a remote client, in other words, a client whos not connecting through the page via the GWTinterface, its a client whos simply making GET, POST requests to a path on the server from elsewhere. This remote client is not using GWT at all. The client is connecting through an HttpServlet, inside this servlet I want to reuse the RPC mechanics so that i dont have to rewrite the interfaces, who are on the client side and using clientdependent code the implementation is already serverside.p  pTo reuse the existing methods on the serverside I could create an instance of MyClassServiceImpl.java and just use those. BUT as you can see above, they are implemented as synchronous methods, since GWTRPC automatically makes the calls asyncronous when using the GWTRPC.p  pHow would i go about to reuse the MyClassServiceImpl on the serverside and also get them as asynchronousp  pAlso if Im wrong with the approach Im taking, please suggest some other solution. For example, one solution might be for the remote client to directly communicate with the RemoteServiceServlet instead of creating a HttpServlet which the client connects through, but I dont know if thats possible and if it is, please tell me howp  pThank youp  pstrongEDITstrong thanks to some answers below I got some insight and will try to improve my questionp  pThe serverside implementation of the methods is SYNCHRONOUS. Meaning they will block until results a returned. When invoking these method from the gwtclient code, they are automatically made ASYNCHRONOUS one can call them by doing the followingp  precodeMyClassServiceAsync  MyClassServiceAsync GWT.createMyClassService.class ServiceDefTarget serviceDef  ServiceDefTarget service serviceDef.setServiceEntryPointGWT.getModuleBaseURL  myService  service.doSomethingnew AsyncCallbackltVoidgt   Override  public void onSuccessVoid result     do something when we know server has finished doing stuff     Override  public void onFailureThrowable caught     codepre  pAs you can see from the above code, there is support for the doSomething method to take an AsyncCallback, without even having the implementation for it. This is what I wanted on the serverside so i didnt have to use threads or create a new implementation for asyncusage. Sorry if I was unclearp

Sniffing variable codethiscode in the function codenoteFcstrcode led to a blind street, because FF puts code[object Window]code into this global variable, contrary to Chrome value code[mouseEvent]code  is there any way to distinguish between such values In addition, I not see how can I to mine a clicked element from an entire code[object Window]code in FF.p  pI have searched the net for many hours, but I found only statements that FF itself passed an event as hidden argument without parameter declaration in inline, only alone parameter in a definition. Unfortunately all found examples have no real argument passed into. What in case of passing the explicit real parameter into function Where is a event implicitly secretly passed into function in such case  codearguments[0]code contains codestrcode explicit text parameter, and codearguments[1]code is undefined.

Negative 627 pIm new to D3 and trying to do a moving average of previous and next values on my data in order to smooth it out.p  pCurrently, I have it working using the 2 previous values  the current value.

Negative 627 pWe are in the process of migrating COM applicationscomponents written in VB6 to .Net.  We have successfully migrated most of our components50 which consists of 1000 classes. One of the last and largest components has 356 classes and when adding the VB6 version to the COM Catalog via Components Services, it loads fine.  After conversion to .Net, when attempting to add to the catalog, we get the 8007007A error.  If we remove some of the classes specifically reduced down to 347, the component loads like a charm. This behavior is displayed on both Windows 7 and Windows Server 2012. The actual dll being added is smaller in .Net than in VB6 no surprise, 5k vs. 1k.  Any ideas as to what the issue really is Dont really trust the error message. Any guidance would be very much appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Negative 627 pI am trying to find the minimal bounding box of a 2d point cloud, where only a part of the point cloud is visible.p  pGiven a point cloud with a rough rectangular shape, clipped so that only one corner is visiblep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1zRwt.png altenter image description herep  pThe point cloud is clipped at the green border. I know the position of the border in the image, and I know that there will always be exactly one corner of the rectangular shape visible within this border. I also know the size of the rectangular shape.p  pNow I want to find the minimal bounding box that contains all the points of this shape, even those not visible onscreen. Since I know the dimensions of the box, finding the two sides visible is enough to determine the other two.br there are actually two possible solutions, since width and height of the shape can be swapped, but lets ignore that for the momentp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuYEGA.png altenter image description herep  pI want to find the red box.p  pI do not need an exact solution, or a fast one. My current attempt uses a simple brute force algorithm that rotates the point cloud in 1 steps and finds the axisaligned bounding box.p  pI just need a criterion that tells me which rotation is the best one for this case. MinimalArea is the usual criterion for a minimal bounding box, but that obviously only works if all points are visible.p  pThere is probably some optimal algorithm involving convex hulls, but Id rather keep the solution as simple as possiblep

Any approach which will enable this url change is welcome.p  pstrong editstrong As an more precise example, visit e.g. a hrefhttpdemo2.woothemes.comnamehub relnofollowhttpdemo2.woothemes.comnamehuba the top bar in this case is at the bottom but the position doesnt really matter. When I click a link in the theme demo the URL will not change, so if I send that link to a friend he will see the frontpage of the template though I may have intended to see him some other concrete subpage. p  pI want to have such a bar which optimally is generated by JavaScript and is executed on the same demo page and not outside an iframe.p

Negative 627 pI know from the Central side you can find the time between a peripherals advertisements, but I would like to know if you could do this on the peripheral side. p  pFor instance, lets say I have an algorithm that uses time as an input.  Now lets look at two consecutive advertisements. the first advertisement will conveniently be from 020 ms and the second advertisement will be from 2140 ms.  My algorithms results arep  presult 1  algorithm output for 020 ms or the time interval between the start advertising call and the actual time the first advertisement is sent.p  presult 2  algorithm output for 2140 ms or the time interval between the first advertisement and the second advertisement.p  pI know there is going to be some lagging due to algorithm processing time and advertisement packet building time, but I would like to know if its possible to record the algorithms output as a string from 019 or almost 20 ms until an advertisement is ready to be sent out at 20 ms with that string.  Then after that, the second advertisment will pick up the algorithms output where the first advertisement left off such as at 20 or 21 ms until its time for that second advertisement to be sent out at 40 ms. I cannot find this in apples documentation.  The thing is I know I will not be able to predict when the advertisement will be sent out.  I just want to basically sayp  pWhen advertisement 1 is sent out at t1p  pp  psend out data gathered from 0  t1p  pp  pWhen advertisement 2 is sent out at t2p  pp  psend out data gathered from t1  t2p  pp  pAgain I know the time you end the interval cannot be the exact same time you send out the advertisement.  I just want something very close to it.  Also I know i could just do the algorithm on the central side using the time elapsed between advertisements received but i actually want to use this with the peripherals sensor readings as well such as total magnetometer readings between advertisement intervals.  p  pThanks and sorry for the long explanation.p

Heres the code for the blinnphong specular highlightsp  precodevec3 halfAngle  normalizelightDirection.xyz  viewRay  float blinnTerm  dotnormal.xyz, halfAngle blinnTerm  clampblinnTerm, 0.0f, 1.0f blinnTerm  powblinnTerm, 300.0f  float specIntensity  intensity  blinnTerm  vec4 specColour  specIntensity  specColour codepre  pcodelightDirectioncode is constant, its infinitely far away ie. the sun.

But if thats the case, how would I go about fixing it Im storing the normals as 16bit floats, but upping it to 32 bits didnt make a difference.p
Negative 627 pThis Im sure is based solely on my lack of understanding of git, The problem is I dont know what I dont know.p  pI have a successful app deployed to Heroku. It tracks work orders for my fire dept. In my normal work flow, I use code git push heroku mastercode from the app directory to deploy my changes. I needed to set this same app up for another fire dept. So I figured Id make a copy of it on my local machine, set up a new heroku app, make the changes needed to make the new copy specific to the new fire dept. Id run codegit initcode etc, then push it up to the new heroku app. Problem is, it pushes up to the old one.  I figure this is because all the git settings were copied when I copied the app directory. How do I make it separate, so they act like 2 unique appsp  pIs there a certain featurearea of git that I should learn about to understand whats going on here p

Negative 627 pIm using codeigniter and I have a situation where I have a users specific array of permissions to specific links defined in a variable inside MyController.php. I also have a multidimensional array of links specified in the config file applicationconfig. Now what is required is to loop through the permissions comparing them against the links array and printing out only those links that the user has permissions to while grouping the links according to their titles as defined in the config file. I have managed to loop through but the problem is that it displays the title after each option instead of printing the title once with a list of links under it. I checked through a similar problem and found out that the solution approach is the same but the problem comes where I have to loop through the permissions array which means I have three nested loops instead of two. Also is there any performance tradeoff in having three nested loopsp  pThis is the expected outputp  pbManagebp  precodeUsers Edit Users Reception codepre  pstrongToolsstrongp  precodeSettings Edit Settings codepre  pThis is what Im gettingp  pbManagebp  precodeUsers codepre  pbManagebp  precodeEdit Users codepre  pbManagebp  precodeReception codepre  pstrongToolsstrongp  precodeSettings codepre  pstrongToolsstrongp  precodeEdit Settings codepre  pHere is the config filep  precodeconfig[nav][manage]  array     users gt authtitleusers,     usersedit gt authtitleusersedit,     reception gt authtitlereception   config[nav][tools]  array     settings gt authtitlesettings,     settingsedit gt authtitlesettingsedit  codepre  pHeres the code in my header.php applicationviewsincludesp  precode navs contains the multidimentional array of the defined links according to the config file navs  thisgtconfiggtitemnav, tankauth   menuitems is the array containing permissions the user has from the db foreachmenuitems as menuitem      val  menuitem      ifnavs     foreachnavs as k gt v         ifisarrayv             headerwritten  FALSE             foreachv as key gt value                  compare permissions against the links                 ifval  key                        if headerwritten                         sectionhr  langauthsection.k                         echo tlth3gt.sectionhr.lth3gtn                                          listitem  langauthtitle.key                     echo tltulgtn                     echo ttltligt.listitem.ltligtn                     headerwritten  TRUE                                                            else             headerwritten  FALSE                         if headerwritten             echo tltulgtn                     codepre

Negative 627 pIt might just be me coming from a more restricted java background, but Im feeling the connection between views and controllers in Laravel is error prone.

How would I go about throwing an error if the controller doesnt pass all variables required to make the view Bonus if it also makes an IDE such as PHPStorm recognize the variables.p

Negative 627 pIm working on an iPad app that presents a smaller view which slides out from the side of the window.  I need this view to run independently from the rest of the app, and I need it to have its own navigation controller so segues can be performed in its table views.  Presenting this view is not the issue.  The problem Im having is that I cannot figure out how to set the UINavigationController to have a root view of this smaller view.p  pI present this view by adding its view controller as a child view with codeaddChildViewControllercode and then move it to the parent view the presenting view controller.p  pIve created the small view controller in my storyboard, and then load the view controller by its identifier.  Here is the relevant portion of the storyboard...p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7zTwi.png altenter image description herep  pThe view loads without issue, but when I select a cell that in turn calls code[self performSegueWithIdentifiergameIdentifier senderself]code, I get the following errorp  pcodeTerminating app due to uncaught exception NSGenericException, reason Could not find a navigation controller for segue Trivia. Push segues can only be used when the source controller is managed by an instance of UINavigationController.codep  pIve tried embedding the view in a Navigation Controller in the storyboard, but had the same result.p  pId be happy to provide any clarification or additional details.  Any suggestions are much appreciated  Thanks p

Negative 627 pIm trying to get a function to set a variable at toplevel scope of a module, but not have it leak into global scope because... bad. At first I thought implicit variable declarations in a module would stay in the module, but it seems like it goes to the script calling the module too.p  pTake for example aModule.node.jsp  precodevar   onlyToThisModule  true  function createAGlobal    creates a implicit var unfortunately   globalToEveryone  true   createAGlobal this will now appear in the global scope for the script that require it. eeek.  console.logonlyToThisModule  exports  createAGlobal codepre  pThen require itp  precodevar   aModule  require.aModule.node.js  console.logglobalToEveryone outputs true console.logtypeof onlyToThisModule outputs undefined codepre  pWhat I would like to do is to declare a variable in codecreateAGlobalcode that would not leak into the global scope. Id like to keep it in the scope of the function that called it. I know I can put it in the var statement of the module itself, but Im looking to declare the variables only if someone executes the function. Is there a way to achieve this type of scopingp

Negative 627 pI started using grunt for my project and I like it so far. I installed some tasks via npm and everything works fine. I would like to have one basic task in my gruntfile that does a grunt install before starting the other tasks, so that every npm dependency is definitely loaded. I need this because if I extend my gruntfile with new tasks, i dont want to run npm install on my jenkins machine by hand and I would like to do this without an extra script running before grunt. Is there a way to achieve this or is this totally crazy p  pIs there a problem with loading npm tasks inside grunt after running my first task Is this even possible How do you solve thisp
Negative 627 pIm trying to embed a video in a JDialog box. Eventually I need to embed three seperate videos and therefore I have implemented the functionality in such a way as to define my own JFXPanel implementation for reuse. I am able to run the application and when I debug into it the createScene is being executed but I am not seeing any visible video and I am not getting any errors. I also attempted to output text and that was not visible either. I have been able to get the video I would like to embed to show in a pure JavaFX implementation so I know it is not the encoding or something. Can I please get somebody to review the following code and give me some suggestions. I am using Netbeans as an IDE if that is important.

Negative 627 pIm trying to figure out what is causing a .NET 4.0 website to hang or process slowly at times.p  pAny given page and its associated code seems to run fine or function in general, and even acceptably quickly when they are just working. But, then, sporadically, any given page load will just sit and spin ... but finishes eventually. This is on a dedicated server at a local ISP. There are numerous other sites running on it entirely classic ASP sites except this one. The other sites generally respond fine when the .NET site is hanging. The bulk of the server activity comes from an ASP forum Snitz on our main site. It doesnt seem to slow at all during the .NET hangs.  Also, theres a Snitz forum in a subdirectory of the problematic site, and running in the same app pool. Mostly, Im not seeing it having problems when the .NET pages hang. Still verifying that a bit further.p  pThe server never seems taxed during any of this, if I watch Task Manager.p  pBasically, what sorts of resources might I employ to troubleshoot this  What pieces of the code does it sound like I need to look into or streamline What other places should I look for troubleshooting methods, if not here And hopefully I have this in the most appropriate Stack forum.p  pIm not sure what sorts of details may in the end be necessary, but heres a smattering, short of handing out all the code for the entire site. p  p Server Info Windows Server 2003, IIS 6.0, SQL Server 2005 9.0p  p Using C CodeBehind Entity Framework LINQ to EF, as well as smatterings of LINQ to object and some SQLDataSource controls a number of User Controls Membership and Roles, but not Profiles, and I tie the Membership data together manually using EF or SQL with other user data in the same database, as well as user data for the forum I have a DLL from ReCaptcha and from Stripe in place, though neither are used much yet.p  p Calling 1 webfont and jQuery from Googles API, Google Analytics, and 1 other local JS file as well as 12 local CSS files.p  p 1 database for the .NET site and all its data and 1 database for the forum with a separate EF model for each database.p  p I am using SSL on the site. I dont require it, but I do direct most everything I can towards it once someone is logged in passively, as well as specifically when it comes to admin, profile, or transaction pages.p  p I have a function in Global.asax that emails me errors when they happen. I dont get any error messages for these hangs.p  p I have external monitors Monitis performing HTTP checks every minute for this site, our main site, and a site on a separate Apache virtual server we also rent as well as pings to this server, the Apache server, and the local network router for our business. The HTTP checks are set to timeout at 5 sec. I almost never hear from the pings, but I get avg. 14 HTTP failuresday, but not consistently from one server or from one site  though the Apache server has largely been quiet of late, and the problematic site more problematic.p  p For the last week Ive used the trial of JetBrains dotTrace, plus SQL Server Profilers Trace tool. For SQL, I dont know so well what to look for, but the only things that stand out to me are that the main Snitz forum is the vastly greater quantity of requests EF makes lots of logins and logouts when I test and many of its requests are in the doubletriple digit milliseconds. For what Ive seen from dotTrace, the most troubling seems to have to do with logging in, but it also shows other processes as taking longer at times. Usually some recursive part of a LINQ query are the bulk of the time.p  p Ive run the .NET site from Visual Web Developer 2010 locally to test. It connects to the live databases, not to test databases. I havent noticed it having problems. It, however, does not use the SSL perhaps obviously. Need to test it further for any issues.p  p I have not implemented any Stored Procedures. Im looking at this as maybe the first thing to try.p  p It doesnt seem to be spammers or bots or such slowing the site down. Ive been taking steps to shut out spammers from forms for both our main site and this .NET site.p  pBy way of actual code relative to the login process that dotTrace points out sometimes, and as an example of places Ive tied together Membership with my own data, this is from the login page, where Im using a LoginView control. Ive ignored 15 lines above it pertaining to the Page directive and to Content placeholders from the Master page, and 5 lines beneath closing things outp  precodeltaspLoginView IdLoginView1 runatservergt     ltAnonymousTemplategt         ltaspLogin IDUserLogin runatserver CssClassFrontEndForm MembershipControl FailureTextWe were unable to log you in.

I load the page, the execution time jumps up to some number, the page finishes in my browser, but I see the line continue to sustain in Perfmon. This can then take several routes if I sit and watch, sometimes it drops back to 0 within 10 seconds, sometimes it goes a while like a halfminute or more before dropping back to 0 or if I reload the page while its still nonzeroed, the line instantly drops to 0, and the execution time starts again. More often than not any immediately subsequent reload has a short, spiked execution time and immediately drops back to 0 when the page finishes  no sustain. Just occurring to me that I should test whether the sustain occurs on new page requests and never on refreshes, or whether its mixed and independent of that.p  pAnyway, what could this sustained execution time mean and what can I do to find out what might still be executing I suppose starting by building a new, simple page, to see if it happens with only basic templates and such in use...p  pOtherwise, I still have the suspicion that usage of .NET Membership is unreliable, and am starting to find out things I can check like .NETs stored procedures and such for unnecessary steps and processes. But the sustain issue above seems independent of .NET Membership.p  pUPDATE 2 Just to tie up loose ends, it seems that the majority of the issues had to do with errors on the hard drive housing most of our websites. For whatever reason, this new .NET site showed the problems the most, but doesnt seem to outright have problems. p  pMany other problems seem to come from issues with our ISP getting spammed. Its hard to tell. My external monitors pinging and HTTPrequesting the sites report timeouts after 57 seconds pretty often, but the ISP rarely ever sees anything and when they do, it either had to do with the hard drive failing having errors or some source barraging our sites.p  pI still have doubts as to how well my creation could handle heavy traffic and I still have my doubts that the HDD its housed on is solid but for now the site is no longer continually problematic  after a disk cleanup, and some time observing the results of that.p

Negative 627 pI tried to write a small application to get familiar with the concept of copyonwrite in user space. Ive read through the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma1565676826758answer by MSaltersa and figured that it would only work if I started with a codemmapcodeed file to store my data in. As I dont need file based persistency, I tried to do the same thing with shared memory. First I codemmapcodeed and initialized a shm fd, then I mapped a second copy with codeMAPPRIVATEcode and read from it again. However, just reading from it causes the kernel to copy the whole thing, taking considerably more time and eating up twice the memory.

Negative 627 pHi I stumbled over the problem that you cannot define dynamic keys for object in JavaScript and thus not in CoffeeScript when using object syntax. Sop  precode     a dynamic   key 1  codepre  porp    precodeINTERPOLATED key 1 codepre  pis invalid JSCoffeeScript code.p  pHow to deal with that when writing grunt configs Usually those are defined using only the object literal syntax. Can it be avoided to store information inside the keys e.g. for grunt plugins that have a configuration like codeoutputfilename inputfilenamecode. Or do people define an object literal as config and then add dynamic keys wherever needed with the code[]codesyntaxp

How can I use CSS to position a variable number of divs with dynamic widths horizontally relative to one anotherp  pTo be more specific heres a diagramp  pI dont have 10 reputation yet so heres a link a hrefhttptinypic.comview.phppic35mqkb6amps8.U8gY4mICSo relnofollowhttptinypic.comview.phppic35mqkb6amps8.U8gY4mICSoap  pThese three divs are inside of another div in grey with overflowx scroll and overflowyhidden. At the moment the divs are positioned with float left, but when I resize the window to make the grey div smaller, the green div will disappear as it jumps below the two other ones.p  pId rather have the green div stay in line and have the grey divs scrollbar account for it. I already tried whitespace nowrap Is there any way to do thisp  pEdit Sorry about that. I didnt include any code.

Negative 627 pIm creating listeners for when a channel is read, and when a channel writes in Netty. Listeners are handled in the Bukkits event system, thats not the problem, the problem is thread safety. The Bukkit Api is run on the main thread and must be in sync or basically the server will explode. Netty is run on multiple threads, so cross communication can be hard with the Bukkit api. I asked on the Bukkit forums and the best answer i got was to create an AtomicBoolean and have a while loop, this would solve the problem with syncing the cancellation of the sending and writing packets but it doesnt fix the problem of changing the packet that is being sent written. when an event is called in Bukkit the listeners are called from each class, under EventHandler. all of that code must be in sync with the main thread, Im not to sure how i would use synchronized in this scenario. sorry for the bad code formatting i cant work this system very well.p  precodepublic class ConnectionInjector extends ChannelDuplexHandler       private User user     private Channel channel     private PacketRecieveEvent recieve     private PacketSendEvent send     private boolean isInjected  false     private boolean isClosed  false      public ConnectionInjectorUser user          this.inituser.getPlayer          public void close          if this.isClosed              this.isClosed  true             if this.isInjected                  getChannel.eventLoop.submitnew CallableltObjectgt                      Override                     public Object call throws Exception                           getChannel.pipeline.removeConnectionInjector.this                         return null                                                          this.isInjected  false                                 public boolean isInjected          return this.isInjected           public boolean isClosed          return this.isClosed            Override     public void writeChannelHandlerContext context, Object packet, ChannelPromise channel          if this.isClosed             throw new IllegalStateExceptionConnection closed already                  PacketData d  new PacketDatapacket         send  new PacketSendEventuser, dthe event         Bukkit.getScheduler.scheduleSyncDelayedTaskMain.getInstance, new Runnable              public void run                  Bukkit.getPluginManager.callEventsend runnable puts it on the main thread                      end of bukkit thread back on netty         if send.isCancelled this possible happens before the above code which is very bad             try                  if send.getPacket.getRawPacket  null                     throw new IllegalStateExceptionsent packet was null   send.getPacket.getRawPacket.getClass.getName                                  super.writecontext, send.getPacket.getRawPacket, channel possible happens before send is even created.              catch Exception e                  e.printStackTrace                                 Override     public void channelReadChannelHandlerContext context, final Object packet throws Exception          PacketData p  new PacketDatapacket         recieve  new PacketRecieveEventuser, p         Bukkit.getScheduler.scheduleSyncDelayedTaskMain.getInstance, new Runnable              public void run                  Bukkit.getPluginManager.callEventrecieve                                 if recieve.isCancelled             super.channelReadcontext, recieve.getPacket.getRawPacket                      public void injectfakePacketObject packet          if this.isClosed             throw new IllegalStateExceptionInjector is closed                  this.getChannel.pipeline.contextencoder.fireChannelReadpacket           public void initPlayer player        this.channel  Channel Nms.getNetChannelplayer         this.channel.pipeline.addBeforepackethandler, epickitpvp, this         this.isInjected  true           public Channel getChannel          if this.channel  null             throw new IllegalStateExceptionchannel is null                  return this.channel        codepre

Negative 627 pIm interested in the best way to have a single Activity that switches between fragments.p  pFor example, if I use Navigation Drawer presented here a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingimplementingnavigationnavdrawer.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingimplementingnavigationnavdrawer.htmla, for each click on item in the Drawers list is called p  precode Swaps fragments in the main content view  private void selectItemint position   Create a new fragment and specify the planet to show based on position Fragment fragment  new PlanetFragment Bundle args  new Bundle args.putIntPlanetFragment.ARGPLANETNUMBER, position fragment.setArgumentsargs   Insert the fragment by replacing any existing fragment FragmentManager fragmentManager  getFragmentManager fragmentManager.beginTransaction                .replaceR.id.contentframe, fragment                .commit   Highlight the selected item, update the title, and close the drawer mDrawerList.setItemCheckedposition, true setTitlemPlanetTitles[position] mDrawerLayout.closeDrawermDrawerList   codepre  pSo every time even if user goes to previously displayed fragment a new fragment is created, and then it replaces the current one. Is there a better way For example reusing fragment instances, or something like thatp

I want to keep this setting so that fastswap works, but Im now unable to publish the module at all. It looks like eclipse is trying to publish one module twice, once in .metadata and the second time in weblogic domain folder. Why is that happening and how can I fix this. Publishing as a packaged ear works and publishing as an exploded ear without the use of eclipse also works just console and exploded ear made by command line maven.p  pEDIT I publish using servers tab in eclipse, by right clicking weblogic and selecting publish and clean as well.p  pEDIT2 I found the following exception in logs occuring before the exception above. It looks like weblogic tries to remove the extra redundant package, but fails, which in turn sets the stage for the next exception to happen.p  precodelt20140729 121408 CESTgt ltWarninggt ltDeployergt ltPL00032WS455gt ltpnbgt lt[STANDBY] ExecuteThread 4 for queue weblogic.kernel.Default selftuninggt ltltWLS Kernelgtgt ltgt ltgt lt1406628848672gt ltBEA149251gt ltOperation Remove failed for application pnbctiear.

Negative 627 pFor the record, this is my Java programming assignment. Its a simple output some data to a file and read it back in type assignment. Ive already done in previous classes simple writing to text files so I wanted to make this one more difficult. In my book there is a topic about using codeObjectOutputStreamnew FileInputStreamcode and codeObjectInputStreamnew FileInputStreamcode to read and write complete objects. Now, Im sure that Im writing 2 objects to this file, the first few tests I only wrote one and then saw the byte size double when I wrote 2. Both objects are of the same type. When I try to read them back in the program gets stuck on the first object in the file and never moves to the next and never throws codeEOFExceptioncode to show the end of the file. Now Im stumped. Ive checked and rechecked the example in my book and searched online and I cant figure why I cant read back in these objects. Ive still got plenty of time to complete this assignment so Im not worried about getting it in on time.p  precode import java.io.EOFException  import java.io.FileInputStream  import java.io.FileNotFoundException  import java.io.FileOutputStream  import java.io.IOException  import java.io.ObjectInputStream  import java.io.ObjectOutputStream    public class TextFileIO       static int[] evenNumbers  new int[50]      static int[] oddNumbers  new int[50] public static void mainString[] args       int evenCount  0     int oddCount  0     forint i  0 i lt 100 i         ifi  2  0             evenNumbers[evenCount]  i             evenCount                  else             oddNumbers[oddCount]  i             oddCount                   ArraySerializable even  new ArraySerializableevenNumbers     ArraySerializable odd  new ArraySerializableoddNumbers      writeToFileeven, odd       readFile   public static void writeToFileArraySerializable array, ArraySerializable array2     try            ObjectOutputStream    output  new ObjectOutputStreamnew FileOutputStreamnumbers.dat           output.writeObjectarray           output.writeObjectarray2           output.close      catch IOException e           e.printStackTrace        public static void readFile          ObjectInputStream input  null         try             whiletrue                 input  new ObjectInputStreamnew FileInputStreamnumbers.dat                 ArraySerializable array                 array  ArraySerializable input.readObject                 int[] numbers  array.getNumbers                 for int i  0 i lt numbers.length i                     System.out.printnumbers[i]   ,                                   catchFileNotFoundException   ClassNotFoundException EOFException ex             ex.printStackTrace             return         catchIOException ex             ex.printStackTrace                  try              input.close          catch IOException e               TODO Autogenerated catch block             e.printStackTrace            codepre  pp  pand my ArraySerializable classp  precode import java.io.Serializable    public class ArraySerializable implements Serializable         private static final long serialVersionUID  1L private int[] numbers  public ArraySerializableint[] numbers     this.numbers  numbers   public int[] getNumbers     return numbers  codepre  pp

What did you use for C multidim linear interpolation p  hr  pIf no equivalent do exist, I need to understand the interp1d better... p  pFirst codeinterp1dcode computes a funtioncodefcode from codexcode and codeycode such that codefx  ycode curve fitting,p  pFrom the Scipy doc p  blockquote   px and y are arrays of values used to approximate some function f y    fx. This class returns a function whose call method uses   interpolation to find the value of new points.p blockquote  pHow is this function codefcode computed from codexcode and codeycode  is it regular linear curve fitting  is there a method for this in MKLArmadillo p

Negative 627 pFrameworks AngularJS MetroJs Jquery Bootstrapp  pQuestion 1 right now I have a tiled DIV design, the tiles will expand when your mouse hovers over them. Instead I want the animated expand to be on click and stay expanded until toggle click. That way the movement is more predictable and easier to navigate from what I currently have. p  pa hrefhttpsnomada.comangulartest relnofollowhttpsnomada.comangulartestap  pQuestion 2 I have div Tags that are repeating, with metro css there is a way to animate tiles. However I want to pass this style as a AngularJS Value for the item being repeated. That way the user can just select animated when they make a post and it will apply the animated style to that post using an injected style from dynamic variable in Angular, It works if i pass the variable into a  tag but that will animate each tile I just want to animate the ones selected, using style but the css I dont know how to put it inside those tags right or if what im doing is possible.

Negative 627 pI am implementing some sort of lazy loading. I have a dict, with each keys value being an empty list. When I access a key, I need to run some loading logic to populate the corresponding list with some values.p  pSo, when I create the dictionary lets name it codedcode there are some keys created codea[], b[]code. Now, when I access a key in the dictionary coded[a]code I need to run some logic that basically returns a computed list lets say code[1, 2, 3]code and the codedcode dict becomes codea [1, 2, 3], b[]code.p  pI hope I explained things well enough. In my knowledge, this is something similar to descriptors in Python since you can attach custom logic to an emattributeem. But what I need here is attaching custom logic to a dicts emkeysem, which surely doesnt work with descriptors.p  pIs there a way of doing this Or maybe I could use descriptors but in some other mannerp

Negative 627 pI would like to write a 3D application using Golang, my favorite programming language. However, I would prefer not to use native OpenGL directly as the graphical frontend as this would entail a larger learning curve than Im willing to tolerate. Additionally, I dont really want to use a Golang game engine like gongine. p  pAfter doing some research I found out about the amazing WebGL Javascript library three.js and I was so intrigued that I completed an introductory Javascript course in a few hours. Im not really a web developer at all, so Im wondering how practical it would be for me to write my application primarily in Go but with a three.js frontend.p  pSome specific questionsp  ul liIs it worthwhile  practical to use Javascriptthree.js as a frontend to a Golang server like thisli liIf it is worthwhile, where can I look to learn how to integrate the two cleanlyli liIf it isnt really worthwhile, which alternatives do I haveli ul  pThanks, any response appreciated.p  h2Edith2  blockquote   pDo you plan to make operations on geometry in Go, possibly in realtime and communicate with your Javascript layer using Websocketsp blockquote  pYes, this is what Im thinking now. Im intending my Golang program to generate streams of vertices and triangles based on a few parameters from the user. Each structure is generated all at once after the users supply their parameters which I see as slider bars  input boxes on a Javascript frontend.p  pHeres an example of something the Go program might generate, plotted in GNUPlot img srchttpdrive.alexozer.comhelixfractal.png altpicp  blockquote   pIf this is the case you underestimate Javascript a bit. You should write most of your application in Javascript and use Go as a classical backend service layer like user accounts, persisting state, etc.p blockquote  pId be fine with doing that, except for these reasonsp  ulliThe core generating process fundamentally depends on Goroutines and channelsli liI know close to nothing about web development, including frontend and backendliul  pSo I suppose Im asking about the implementation details of one of these three possibilities liWriting most of the program, including the generator, in JS, and a minimal backend in Goli liWriting most of the program in Go and using JS just as a graphical frontendli liSomething elselip

Negative 627 pDuring a lengthy about 1 minute process I am trying to log some progress by writing timestamped messages to a text control. But all messages appear at once. Apparently, all codePropertyChanged eventscode are queued until my busy process is done, and received by the text control all at once. How can I kind of flush the events in the middle of my busy process I searched but could not find a FlushUpdateDispatch call to immediately process queued events.p  pA multi threaded solution is in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1194620howdoidisplayprogressduringabusyloopquestion 1194620a, but I would first like to avoid multithreading if possible. In older environments C, .Net WinformsASP there were always system calls like codeUpdatecode to interrupt a busy process to handle pending events.p  pEdit Please dont tell me that that a lengthy process should be in another thread. I agree. But this is inherited code, and before I would even think about converting to multithreaded, I first need to log certain events to understand what it does. Besides, this app has many other problems that need to be fixed first.

Negative 627 pI have a Raspberry Pi with a GPIO display.  I currently have it set up as a framebuffer device at devfb1.  Is there a way to make it my default or primary display for X windows  Im ultimately trying to draw graphics to it, I was originally planning on using DirectFB and SDL, but DirectFB is in alpha for the pi.  Ive tried using SDL1.2 as well since it has Framebuffer support, but I cant figure out how to get SDL to choose a framebuffer device to draw to without using DirectFB.p  pI considered using SDL to prepare each frame of my simple GUI as a raw image and use mmap to blit it to devfb1 instead of using SDLs built in draw functions, but I feel like this is a poor way to achieve my goal.  p  pI think that if I can get xorg to use my framebuffer device as the primary monitor, I wouldnt have to worry about doing anything special to have SDL draw my image files.  But Im not really sure how xorg really works and if this is possible.p  pAny insight or help anyone has would greatly help  Ive been butting heads with this problem for a week looking at different possibilities.p

Negative 627 pIm a Japanese language graduate experiment with JavaScript for a project and the first thing I tried to create was this simple JavaScript based FlashCard game.p  pIt basically generates an array of random numbers and uses this random numbers to fill the divs with 6 possible choices using jQuery.

Finally, it reads the user choice using jQuery text method and do the expected output based on that.p  pThe flashcard is running almost fine.

Negative 627 pThis question arose when I was making programmaticallycreated view controller. This controller was supposed to support any interface orientation. And according to good practice I was creating subviews on codeviewDidLoadcode and setting up their frames on codeviewWillLayoutSubviewscode. Such approach is good, because codeviewWillLayoutSubviewscode not only layout your subviews on the beginning but also handles interface rotations and other changes of view controllers view. p  pOn iOS 8 everything was ok, but when i was running the app on iOS 6 and 7 layout was broken. I found out that the reason was that the layout was based on codeself.view.framecode property. And if you try to print the frame on codeviewWillLayoutSubviewscode on different iOS versions, you will get different results, when device is in landscape mode.p  precode voidviewWillLayoutSubviews      [super viewWillLayoutSubviews]     NSLog, NSStringFromCGRectself.view.frame  codepre  pOutput on iOS 8 after turning device to landscape modep  blockquote   pstrong20141007 173511.028 BlaBlaApp[36112587] 0, 0, 568, 320strongp blockquote  pOutput on iOS 7 and 6 same device orientationp  blockquote   pstrong20141007 173511.028 BlaBlaApp[36112587] 0, 0, 320, 568strongp blockquote  pOn iOS 7 and 6 view frame doesnt change when device orientation changes.

Negative 627 pHow come namespaces, functions and variables all collide if they have the same name within the same scope, whereas structs  classes, while colliding with the first one, dont collide with variables and functions p  pI could see why if structs  classes and namespaces collided with each other but not with functions and variables but I find it odd that structs  classes dont collide with variables and functions when namespaces do, perhaps because they are used in the same way  and both make out sorts of namespaces which would explain that they needed to be distinct from each other whereas the result now seems a bit inconsequent.p  pExample 1p  precodeint A struct A  void A  Collision with int A namespace A  Collision with int A and also struct A if int A is removed codepre  pExample 2p  precodestruct A  void A   int A Collision with function A namespace A  Collision with function A and also struct A if int A is removed codepre  pExample 3p  precodenamespace A     struct A  Collision with namespace A void A  Collision with namespace A int A Collision with namespace A and function A if namespace A is removed codepre

Negative 627 pIm writing an assembly code which should display a character randomly. In this code, I use the function generateRandom to get random values using CXDX which I copy to row and column. As you can see, I use the same function for row and column. However, no character is displayed. I tried changing the values and variables and found that the character isnt displayed whenever a variable is assigned to dh. The variable row and column work fine when assigned to dl. The character is only displayed whenever I assign a numeric value directly to dh.

Negative 627 pLearning to log errors. This is a basic structure of code all through my project.p  pI have been advised that the try block has to be placed only in Event Handlers. But when logging the error, it is required to know, which method caused the error. So, in such cases, should I also keep try block in codeAllIsFinecode amp codeSaveDatacode.

Negative 627 pIm learning react and Im trying to create a TreeView component. This TreeView can receive the data itself through data prop or as an url to a rest resource. Im focusing on this last option here.p  pThe component is first rendered in a loading state and the ajax call is made on componentDidMount. When data is return from the REST service I just assign it to components props.data and setStateloadingfalse and it correctly renders the filled up tree.p  pOne problem here is that Im mutating props from the component itself witch is an antipattern in react but also it doesnt feels right to add data to state. I tend to see state as related to UI interaction and use it to things like collapsed or selected When updating the parent component the one containing the TreeView the treeView data prop is reseted componentDidMount is not called so its not even fetched again and component breaks. Using state fixes this as its value is maintained during this parent rerender.p  pShould state be used here Is there any better pattern for thisp  pBesides retrieving data from server theres also the problem of changing the tree data itself like moving an tree item no another place Right now I just change the items in props.data and forceUpdate the relevant inner components.p  pShould I just use state and setState in the TreeView root component and let react diff the whole thing again Its quite a large tree by the way... Should I wrap the tree in some other data component that will pass down the datap  pCan someone help find the best way to structure this component Thanks and Merry Christmas p

At this point AUTO INCREMENT works just fine, until there is need for ROLLBACKS After such consecutive record exists, I have to perform some processes using that consecutive number and that process may Fail, which leads to an inevitable ROLLBACK...p  pThe next time I try to insert a record, the AUTO INCREMENT column can not use the already lost consecutive number due to certain unbreakable rules from MySQL.p  pI can not use the codeMAXid  1code way, because there may be another user in the system doing the same process, generating hisher ownnext consecutive id with success.p  pI have an idea about this To get all consecutive IDs so far in that table, and loop them with the program to find the first missing ID, although Im not sure about this because another user may be doing the same and there could be only 1 missing consecutive, so both users will try to insert using the same consecutive.... etc, etc..p  pSo, I need this consecutive to be consistent even if there is need of ROLLBACK.p  pstrongIs there any alternative to AUTO INCREMENT in MySQL, with PHP, or anything else, so that I can generate consecutive IDs in a consistent way no matter if I have to ROLLBACK one or two of those insertionsstrong.p  pThanks for any help.p

Negative 627 pIm learning ImageJ now but I got a problem.p  pFirst, I added an overlay to an image using ImageOverlayAddImage in menu. Now I want to rotate the image and keep the upper overlay remained as a reference. But when I use the rotate commandImageTransformrotate, the overlay is removed.p  pHowever, this operation is fine with rotating 90 degreesImageTransformRotate 90 degrees leftgight and the translate commandImageTransformtranslate. These are just what I want, keeping the overlay remained and make the origin image change.p  pIm wondering why these are different, especially the rotate and the rotate 90 degrees, and how to rotate correctly with out removing the overlay. Anybody can help me Thanksp

Negative 627 pMy problem I have a PLC, a Raspberry Pi with a weather station and a Solar inverter in my home network. The Raspberry and the inverter have the possibility to deliever JSON data output. I like to access these data with a HTML webpage which is placed on the webserver of the PLC. But unfortunately Im not able to access the JSON data within my network. Its possible to parse the data when I copy the data locally on webserver or PC for testing purposes, so the JSON data is free of errors. But when I want to access the data directly with JavaScript, nothing happens... I tried JQuery, Ajax and also a lot of the tips regarding cross domain access. Any tips what I can try to access the data within my network Maybe someone with a similar hardware setup can help. Thanks a lot in advancep

Negative 627 pI am a rather newer user for Java as Ive only learned some recently within the last couple of months and have never done any real programming before, so please try to explain to me the terms that you are talking about if they are complicated or please redirect me to any other threads with explanations of what you are possibly talking about. So our of curiosity, for one of my programs, is there a way I can possibly write all the capital letters and lowercase letters, or do I have to type them all out Thanks, Riship

Negative 627 pI have a bunch of DF named like df1, df2, ..., dfNp  pand lt1, lt2, ..., ltNp  pI would like to merge them in a loop, something likep  precodefor X in 1N outputX lt mergedfX, ltX, ...  codepre  pBut I have some troubles getting the name of output, dfX, and ltX to change in each iteration. I realize that plyrdata.tablereshape might have an easier way, but I would like for loop to work.  p  pPerhaps I should clarify. The DF are quite large, which is why plyr etc will not work they crash. I would like to avoid copying.  The next in the code is to save the merged DF. This is why I prefer the forloop apporach, since I know what each merged DF is named in the enviroment. p

Negative 627 pThank you in advance for the helpp  pIm attempting to convert a specific javascript map into a nested JSON object.  A sample of the map looks likep  precode[a, [b, c]] [b, [e]] [c, [f]] [e, []] [f, []] codepre  pwhere the key represents a parent node, and the values in the arrays are its direct children. Empty arrays for values indicates no children for that given key.

Additionally, though trivial, the keys nor the values in the arrays are assumed to be sorted.  p  pLastly, I know this lends itself to a recursive solution.  Any help would be immensely appreciated.

Negative 627 pI defined some classes with, each one, several public methods with Test annotation. All methods follow the same behavioral pattern retrieve ressources from IDs, test if empty, log, call the real test for each line on the resource. So, Ive externalized this behavior in an abstract class I instanciate on each method, like thisp  precodeTest public void someTest   new BasicTestPatternX,Y,Z  some parameters to retrieve resources      Override      protected void testLine          someCheck1         someCheck2         .run  codepre  pThis solution eliminate 1030 lines per test method. Now, I want to go further with a custom annotation, like thatp  precodeTestPatternparam1X,param2Y,param3Z public void someTest   someCheck1   someCheck2  codepre  pFinally I created a little framework to retrieve all the methods with this new annotation in order to instanciate BasicTestPattern and execute it. It is executed well in a TestCase subclass, like thatp  precodeTestCase junittest  new TestCase   Override   public void runTest      pattern.run      junittest.run codepre  pHowever, no Test is displayedlisted in the JUnit view from Eclipse. I see only the number of tests succeeded. How can I do that  Thank you.p

Negative 627 pI have multiple series of data.p  ul liSeries are years 2013,2014,2015 etc.li liData is datevalue within a given year. li liBecause data needs to be categorized with years, Im using day of the year values on the x axis, range between 1 and 366. So values for a given year look like this 1,80, 30,100, 60,71 ..... 255,130li ul  pExample diagramp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comaqXbc.png altenter image description herep  pMy problem is that the X axis contains day of the year values, but I have to put month names there. Unfortunately, using a simple DateAxis is not an option, because X values are day numbers not dates, and AFAIK there is no date format that could convert 335 to December. Another problem with DateAxis is that it represents points in time, and it provides a separate X axis label for any point in time. But I need to write out labels for exact points in time. Namely only at the begining of the months. What I really want is something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSkQqA.png altenter image description herep  pE.g. instead of putting ticks at the beginningend of a month, I want to display regions. What makes it harder is that the months have different lengths.

But now its refreshing the page, and jumping to the top of the page. which is a bit annoying.p  ol liI got an form with multiple buttons, those buttons contain the ID of the radio from the database.li liThen i got my player, without the form being posted, printing a default player, on submit of the form, itll load all the information needed from the database with the ID thats being posted to the player.li ol  pNow my question is, how to stop the form from refreshing and jumping back to the top of the page, while it does post to the player.p  pif you guys need any code, i am wiling to post it here, but since it a shitload of code on my index.php i need a site where i can put this on.p

Negative 627 pWhat would be a suitable candidate for a highperformance concurrent collection with the following requirementsp  ol liThe number of elements in the collection is small a few elements, usually less than 10 and rarely changes.li liThe main use case is iterating through the elements. This happens a lot and must be super fast i.e. should be lock free.li liOccasionally an element will be removed by use of the iterator remove method. This should preferably also work very fast but its less significant than the iterator next method.li liThe order of the elements is insignificant so it doesnt matter how elements are inserted to the collection.li liPreferably something from the standard Java library.li ol  pI considered using ConcurrentLinkedQueuelt for this, but found mentions of it leaking memory by design if you never call the poll method. Im not sure if this is still the case the posts mentioning this are from  2011 and I found some mentions that this may have been addressed.p  pI also considered ConcurrentSkipListSetlt, but Im not sure what is the effect of the sorting on the performance since I dont care about the order.p

Negative 627 pI am currently planning how to develop a emman in the middleem network application for TCP server that would transfer data between server and client. It would behave as regular client for server and server for remote client without modifying any data. It will be optionally used to detect and measure how long server or client is not able to receive data that is ready to be received in situation when connection is inactive.p  pI am planning to use blocking send and recv functions. Before any data transfer I would call a setsockopt function to set SOSNDTIMEO and SORCVTIMEO to about 10  20 miliseconds assuming it will force blocking send and recv functions to return early in order to let another active connection data to be routed. Running thread per connection looks too expensive. I would not use async sockets here because I can not find guarantee that they will get complete in a parts of second especially when large data amount is being sent or received. High data delays does not look good. I would use very small buffers here but calling function for each received byte looks overkill.p  pMy next assumption would be that is safe to call send or recv later if it has previously terminated by timeout and data was received less than requested.p  pBut I am confused by contradicting information available at msdn.p  blockquote   psend functionp      pa hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms74014928vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms74014928vvs.8529.aspxap      pIf no error occurs, send returns the total number of bytes sent, which   can be less than the number requested to be sent in the len parameter.p blockquote  hr  blockquote   pSOLSOCKET Socket Optionsp      pa hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms74053228vvs.8529.aspx relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopms74053228vvs.8529.aspxap      pSOSNDTIMEO  The timeout, in milliseconds, for blocking send calls.

The index itself loads just fine but if I click on something that should redirect me to other page of the site, it sends me a 404 error.p  pIf I dont put the codepatternSyntaxWildcardcode, the index.php it will work perfectly fine although it gets stuck in the loop but for some reason it doesnt affect the index webpage other than having a mildly annoying error in the debug console. But if I dont put the codepatternSyntaxWildcardcode the Admin page will simply get stuck in redirection loop and not load.p  pIve been told to recycle the application pool IIS 7.5 but it does not fix my problem.

Negative 627 pI have created a userform that has two buttons on it.  One is called CmdCon6 and the other is called CmdLbs6.  When clicked, they are suppose to close the current userform, pull up another userform, and pull values from the 4th column in sheet18 and add them to a combobox named x48 both of the new userforms have a combobox named x48in the new userform.  The range of cell values to be added to the combobox x48 will flucuate, but never exceed 20 hence why I added a loop.  Everything works great and does what it is suppose to do when I click the CmdCon6 button, but when I click the CmdLbs button, it gives me a runtime error 70 Permission denied and highlights the 20th line of code line between the If and end if in the Sub CmdLbsClick.  p  pI have tried to change the name of the combobox x48 in the frmInputLbs6 userform and keep it as x48 for the frmInputCon6 userform, but I still received the same error.  p  pAny suggestions to fix this issue Im stumped, and cant think of a way around it.

Negative 627 pI am trying to modify a hrefhttpscode.msdn.microsoft.comTouchkeyboardsample43532fda relnofollowthis examplea the codeTouchedTextBlockcode control in particular for a text editing codeUserControlcode. Unfortunately, the sample is far from adequate. The only thing it allows is for the software keyboard to show up when user taps on the control the keyboard does not supply dictionary suggestion as user types. Also, it doesnt illustrate how my control should receive and process editing commands for instance, if user picks a word suggested by the keyboard, how does my control gets the word and add it to the text I added debugging code to track method calls and it seems that none of the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsappswindows.ui.xaml.automation.provider.itextprovider.aspx relnofollowITextProvidera, a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsappsee671565.aspx relnofollowIValueProvidera and a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsappswindows.ui.xaml.automation.provider.itextrangeprovider.aspx relnofollowITextRangeProvidera implemented is called. So my questions arep  p1 When are the method in the aforementioned interfaces invoked Can anyone explain the workflowinteraction of the UI Automation mechanismp  pI am so confused by many articles on MSDN. My rough understanding is that the keyboard is like a client executing in a separate process from the app in the UI Automation framework and the codeAutomationPeercode is like the server. Somehow in this example, the keyboard client does not interact at all with my codeAutomationPeercode it only interacts with the entire app via supplying key events while it should specifically interact with the customized codeAutomationPeercode. I would expect the following workflowp  ul liUser taps on the controlli liThe control gain focus by calling codeFocuscodeli liUpon gaining focus, the framework invokes codeOnCreateAutomationPeercode to create my customized implementation of codeAutomationPeercodeli liFramework determines the patterns and control type, show software keyboard if codeTextcode pattern is detected and the text is not readonlyli listrongWhat really happens in the samplestrong the keyboard seems to supply raw key events to the entire application.  strongWhat I expectstrong the keyboard remotely invokes my codeAutomationPeercodes methods to let users insert characters and words and backspace, enter, ... to my control.li ul  p2 Is there a sample illustrating how to provide suggestionp  pemPlease do not suggest me to use buildin controls such as codeTextBoxcode or codeRichEditBoxcode I would have used them if they suit my need.emp

I noticed the issue when I opened bad files with notepad and manually copied and examined xml rdf sections of them and the ones from good ones. What I found out that Photoshop, Camera Raw etc. write a lot of information regarding what has been don to the image. Sometimes it takes many pages to scroll which in turn results in causing .NET to fail. So if I delete some data, for example running such commandp  precodeJpegMeta.RemoveQueryxmpcrsPaintBasedCorrections codepre  pI get my queries work. I can look in the file and remove many other that are likely wont be used by anyone.p  pBut this approach is bad because first of all Im removing some data that may be needed for someone in some scenarios, but most importantly I dont know which section will be too big next time. If someone close and open PSD file 1000 times it will cause 1000 section on image history recorded and saved to JPEG and .NET will fail again when I want to use this file.p  pSuggestions are welcomed.  p

Negative 627 pstrongQuestion in a nutshellstrongp  pI recently discovered an extension to gcc which I have found very cool and helpful. This allows you to specify the index at which initializer elements go in an array. So instead ofp  precodestatic const uint8t array[4]       2,     1,     3,     4  codepre  pone can writep  precodestatic const uint8t array[4]       [1]  1,     [0]  2,     [2]  3,     [3]  4  codepre  pOften, however, I have an array for which I have one or two specific values which need to be different, with the rest of the array set to some default value. Id like to be able to do this all in an initializer something likep  precodestatic const uint8t array[4]       [1]                1,     [everything else]  0  codepre  pDoes anyone know of a good way to do this The only way Ive come up with which seems more than a little hacky is to define an codeEVERYTHINGELSEcode macro which depends on the same values, and the array length  something like thisp  precodedefine VALUE                            8 define DEFAULT                          1 define INDEX                            2 define ARRAYLENGTH                     4 define EVERYTHINGELSEn, index, len   index  n  len  static const uint8t array[ARRAYLENGTH]       [EVERYTHINGELSE1, INDEX, ARRAYLENGTH]  DEFAULT,     [EVERYTHINGELSE2, INDEX, ARRAYLENGTH]  DEFAULT,     [EVERYTHINGELSE3, INDEX, ARRAYLENGTH]  DEFAULT,     [INDEX]                                    VALUE   codepre  pstrongA bit of backgroundstrongp  pI do embedded systems programming, which often means configuring peripherals. In this particular case, each element of an array might correspond to a channel in a peripheral. If Im building a project for different boards, with slightly different pin assignment, I might be using different channels in different cases. To help enforce correctness and portability I prefer to define this value in one place, and write code which depends on this one value.p  pAdditionally, I need to ensure that all other channels in that particular peripheral are deactivated. In the example above, I have a simple array of ints, but generally the case is more complicated its an array of initializer structs, or something like that. I know that a static array will be initialized to zero by default, but its not always the case that zero corresponds to uninitialized further, I consider it bad form to depend on a library constant being a specific value for correctly functioning code.p  pI could make the array nonconst and do initialization at runtime, but in an embedded system this can be a problem. If you only have 6k of RAM, theres strong motivation to put everything that can be determined at compiletime in flash memory, to leave maximum RAM space for things that actually NEED to vary at runtime.p

Having looked at the raw output from codeMindFlexcode, it comes as lines of numbers the values from the codeEEGcode. Clearly, the script is having trouble with that. A typical line might look likep  precode20010,2140,43234,345,2342,2342,4534,5643,564,3244,7865  codepre  pI can see what the script is trying to do, just not why it cant do it. Your help is much appreciated.p
