Positive 54630 pFirst I am not GAS savvy.  About 3 years ago, I got some help to make one of my Sites pages retrieve the contents of one of my Drive folders. It basically did this each and every night at about midnight.  Back in April of this year, specifically Apr 23, 2015, the script stopped working.  I assume that the script I was using was calling a service that had been discontinued Google Docs vs Google Drive, maybe. Its 6 months later, and Im just now getting around to attempting to find out what is happening, and hopefully someone can help me get back up and running. p  pIssue I have no idea where this script is located, nor how I can open it up to look at it, nor what I would do with it once I did open it up.

Positive 54630 pI am attempting to write a script that on form submit will send two sets of data to two different spreadsheets. The data is derived from one form.

I realize my script is probably not the most efficient, for example, I could not get a range to workp  pThe sleep utilities were inserted as I thought there may have been a delay in the writing of the forms input to the spreadsheet and the script was running before this was complete.p  pThe script is attached to the form which writes to a Form Responses sheet, this is then split to a company spreadsheet and a customer spreadsheet.

Negative 54630 pFor example, a hrefhttpreductiotest.org relnofollowReductioa for JavaScala and a hrefhttpwww.cs.chalmers.serjmhQuickCheck relnofollowQuickChecka for Haskell.  The kind of framework Im thinking of would provide generators for builtin data types and allow the programmer to define new generators.  Then, the programmer would define a test method that asserts some property, taking variables of the appropriate types as parameters.  The framework then generates a bunch of random data for the parameters, and runs hundreds of tests of that method.p  pFor example, if I implemented a Vector class, and it had an add method, I might want to check that my addition commutes.  So I would write something like in pseudocodep  precodeboolean testAddCommutesVector v1, Vector v2      return v1.addv2.equalsv2.addv1  codepre  pI could run testAddCommutes on two particular vectors to see if that addition commutes.  But instead of writing a few invocations of testAddCommutes, I write a procedure than generates arbitrary Vectors.  Given this, the framework can run testAddCommutes on hundreds of different inputs.p  pDoes this ring a bell for anyonep

Does the server expect anything from the client at this point, and if so  what Does this mode of operation work at allp  pSome more info on this problem apparently, the intended mechanism of working with RTSP over HTTP built into RealPlayer is as followsp  ol liTry to connect to the following ports 80, 8080, 554, 7070. Try also to download the file directly, just for the heck of it, by issuing GET a hrefhttphostnameportmediafilename relnofollowhttphostnameportmediafilenamea on port 80li liFor each of the above ports, create 2 connections. li liSend a GET request to one of the connections to the url a hrefhttphostnameportSmpDsBhgRl relnofollowhttphostnameportSmpDsBhgRlacodeltguidgtcode11, where codeltguidgtcode is, yes, a freshly created GUID. Add a header to this request called XActualURL containing the original RTSP URL.li liSend a POST request on the other connection, to the URL a hrefhttphostnameportSmpDsBhgRl relnofollowhttphostnameportSmpDsBhgRla with the GUID above as part of the body of the request. Send a ContentLength header of 32767 bytes, to prevent the proxy from closing the connection prematurely.li liStart issuing commands to the server through the POST request, and get the corresponding RTSP stream as part of the GET response.li ol  pThe strange stuff if the above isnt strange enough is that, for example, it works with Squid, but not if you use either of the ports 3128 or 8080 Somehow, the client uses the port it connects to to decide on the order of the requests or on when a request should be canceled, but anyway, as hard to believe as it is, it works with proxy port 9090, 3129, 8081, but not with 3128 or 8080.p  pUpdate 2 a hrefhttpshelixcommunity.orgviewcvsprotocolcommonutilhxcloakedsocket.cppviewmarkup relnofollowHereas the source of the RealPlayer with the explanation of the above behavior. Still no solution though.p  pUpdate 3 OK, in the light of the above, the magic value of 48 02 02 00 is clear 48  h is for codeHTTPRESPONSEcode, the next 02 is the length of the following data, the next 02 is called codePOSTNOTRECEIVEDcode meaning that the POST request did not reach the server within a second from the corresponding GET request.p  pUpdate 4 This behavior i.e. POST requests with huge ContentLength is also characteristic of an ActiveX used by WebEx and, possibly, many other web apps that need an open channel to the server.p

Negative 54630 pI was working on implementing a quicksort yesterday, and then I ran it, expecting a faster runtime than the Mergesort which I had also implemented. I ran the two, and while the quicksort was faster for smaller data sets lt100 elements and I ididi verify that it works, the mergesort became the quicker algorithm fairly quickly. I had been taught that quicksort is almost always quicker than mergesort, and I understand that there is some debate on this topic, but I at least expected it to be closer than this.

Negative 54630 pI want to distribute a crossplatform application for which the executable file is slightly different, depending on the user who downloaded it. This is done by having a placeholder string somewhere in the executable that is replaced with something userspecific upon download.p  pThe webserver that has to do these string replacements is a Linux machine. For Windows, the executable is not compressed in the installer .exe, so the string replacement is easy.p  pFor uncompressed Mac OS X .dmg files, this is also easy. However, .dmg files that are compressed with either gzip or bzip2 are not so easy. For example, in the latter case, the compressed .dmg is not one big bzip2compressed disk image, but instead consists of a few different bzip2compressed parts with different block sizes and a plist suffix. Also, decompressing and recompressing the different parts with bzip2 does not result in the original data, so Im guessing Apple uses some different parameters to bzip2 than the commandline tool.p  pIs there a way to generate a compressed .dmg from an uncompressed one on Linux which does not have hdiutil Or maybe another suggestion for creating customized applications without pregenerating them It should work without any input by the user.p

I can stop andor restart the debugging and it works but goes back to the beginning. The gdb prompt, will let me write, but nothing happens. I cannot view object values or anything debugging related. I cannot resume execution, it wont do anything.p  pThe strange thing is that, if I put a breakpoint embeforeem or emafterem that line the loadMap, it all works, and I can step out or in, debug it and do all I want to do.p  pWhat am I missingp  pA couple of seconds after the failing breakpoint is hit and it hangs the stack window clears.

Negative 54630 pIn my Java application, Im writing a component that is used to view PDF files.  I had a pretty slick implementation where the user could click on the PDF and drag it to view the areas that didnt fit on the screen.  But my boss didnt like it, so now I have to use scroll bars.  So I did the obvious thing and just put it into a JScrollPane, but almost no matter what I do it refuses to work.p  pThe PDF just gets converted to a BufferedImage and then I convert it to an ImageIcon so I can add it to a JLabel which gets added to a JScrollPane.p  pI have a PDFViewer class which subclasses JScrollPane, and the important code is herep  precodeprivate void drawPDF      PDFRenderer renderer  new PDFDrawerpdfFile     BufferedImage image  renderer.makeImagepage     JLabel img  new JLabelnew ImageIconimage     this.setViewportViewimg  codepre  pNow I have a separate class which subclasses JFrame that I need to add my PDFViewer to. It works as long as I dont use a layout and add the PDFViewer directly to the JFrame.  If I even just add the JScrollPane to a JPanel and then add the JPanel to the JFrame the scroll bars disappear and it looks like I just added the JLabel directly.  The image is too big for this, and it gets cut off easily.br I need to add some controls to the frame as well, so I set up a really basic GridBagLayout with the PDFViewer as the only component being added.  And with the following code I get a window that a hrefhttpimgur.comGqoE9.jpg relnofollowlooks like thisa.p  precodeGridBagLayout glayout  new GridBagLayout GridBagConstraints c setLayoutglayout PDFViewer viewer  new PDFViewerfoo.pdf c  new GridBagConstraints c.gridx  0 c.gridy  0 c.gridheight  1 c.gridwidth  1 addviewer, c setVisibletrue codepre  pWhy does the JScrollPane get smooshed like that when I just simply add it to a layout instead of directly to the JFrame  I found out that it works with GridLayout, but a GridLayout is not what I want.p

Anyone have any ideas as to why it is exhibiting this behaviourp  pEdit 2 Been playing with the code for over a week now, and I am still unable to get the assets NSArray to accurately show content.  Ive determine it must be tied to the order of which the blocks are executed.  When I call codeusingAssetscode, the method itself completes, but the blocks dont run right away.  So, say I tie the method to a button, and immediately print the contents of codeassetscode, its empty I have 2 images in the library.  I click the button again, now the contents show 2 items.  If I click it a third time, it shows 4.  It is almost as if the Blocks run after control is returned to the user back to the application loop Im on the verge of giving up, scrapping my assets code and just loading them based on the path they exist in, but Id rather use assets, if I can figure out why it is not behaving as expectedp

Negative 54630 pIve been trying to understand how to draw graphics on Android using a hierarchy of custom views, custom viewgroups, and relativeLayouts. Im having a hard time figuring out how to have the parents tell the children where to position themselves and at what size. I think it is working when the custom ViewGroup tells its children to be a certain size, but I cant figure out how to have the relativeLayout tell its ViewGroup children what size and position to be. Right now, the following code draws a circle in the top and center of the screen. This is Android 3.0 on the Xoom. The size of the circle is 295x295, so Im assuming this is somehow the default size and position of a layout Can anyone give me the code that would be needed so that I could programatically pick the size and location of the viewgroup that contains the view that contains the circle The edges of the circle on the four sides are getting trimmed off just so, so I know that the relativelayout is cutting off the rest of the viewgroup from printing. If I have the ViewGroup measure the View at a smaller size, it will print it at that size up in the left corner of that same rectangle in the top center of the screen.p  pMy Activitys onCreatep  precode public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     CustomViewGroup custVG  new CustomViewGroupthis     RelativeLayout rel  new RelativeLayoutgetApplicationContext     rel.setLayoutParamsnew LayoutParamsLayoutParams.FILLPARENT, LayoutParams.FILLPARENT      rel.addViewcustVG      RelativeLayout.LayoutParams params2  new RelativeLayout.LayoutParamsLayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT,                       LayoutParams.WRAPCONTENT       params2.addRuleRelativeLayout.ALIGNPARENTRIGHT        rel.addViewnew CustomViewGroupgetApplicationContext,1,             new ViewGroup.LayoutParamsLayoutParams.MATCHPARENT,LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT      setContentViewrel   codepre  pMy Custom made ViewGroupp  precodeCustomView cust int height int width  public CustomViewGroupContext context      supercontext     cust  new CustomViewcontext      Canvas canvas  new Canvas      this.addViewcust,new RelativeLayout.LayoutParamsLayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT    Override  public void onDrawCanvas canvas     this.drawChildcanvas,cust,0      Override protected void onLayoutboolean arg0, int arg1, int arg2, int arg3, int arg4       cust.layoutthis.getLeft, this.getTop, this.getRight, this.getBottom   Override protected void onMeasureint widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec      Measure the only child     this.measureChildcust,widthMeasureSpec, heightMeasureSpec      height  View.MeasureSpec.getSizeheightMeasureSpec     width  View.MeasureSpec.getSizewidthMeasureSpec     setMeasuredDimensionheight, width  codepre  pMy Custom Viewp  precodepublic CustomViewContext context     supercontext    Override public void onDrawCanvas canvas       float noteRadius  width2      Paint paint  new Paint     paint.setAntiAliastrue     paint.setColorColor.YELLOW     paint.setStylePaint.Style.STROKE     float strokeWidth  paint.getStrokeWidth     paint.setStrokeWidthstrokeWidth      canvas.drawCircleheight2, width2, noteRadius, paint       Override     protected void onMeasureint widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec           height  View.MeasureSpec.getSizeheightMeasureSpec         width  View.MeasureSpec.getSizewidthMeasureSpec         Log.iCustomView onMeasure,Width   width   Height   height          setMeasuredDimensionheight, width      codepre  pSorry this is long.

Negative 54630 pWe have a Java application that processes requests.

I can remember several cases of analyzing multithreading issues from thread dumps and it was very important to me to know whether I see the same thread in two consecutive dumps or not. However, I realize that I could look at the thread ID instead. In log4j logs its a common practice to write the thread name and I remember many cases of filtering by it. But still Im not sure I have a good line of defense here.p  pWhat is the common practice Is it a good idea to keep renaming threadsp  pThere are related questions like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions467224renamingthreadsinjavaRenaming Threads in Javaa or a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3157852shouldthreadsinjavabenamedforeasierdebuggingShould threads in Java be named for easier debugginga but they do not address this specific issue.p

I am clueless where thats actually happening.p  pThe stack looks like thisp  precode0   CoreFoundation                      0x00fbd5a9 exceptionPreprocess  185 1   libobjc.A.dylib                     0x01111313 objcexceptionthrow  44 2   CoreFoundation                      0x00fbf0bb [NSObjectNSObject doesNotRecognizeSelector]  187 3   CoreFoundation                      0x00f2e966 forwarding  966 4   CoreFoundation                      0x00f2e522 CFforwardingprep0  50 5   Foundation                          0x007aa669 nsnotecallback  145 6   CoreFoundation                      0x00f959f9 CFXNotificationPostold  745 7   CoreFoundation                      0x00f1493a CFXNotificationPostNotification  186 8   Foundation                          0x007a020e [NSNotificationCenter postNotificationNameobjectuserInfo]  134 9   CoreData                            0x00d295b9 [NSManagedObjectContextNSInternalAdditions didSaveChanges]  1513 10  CoreData                            0x00d2388a [NSManagedObjectContext save]  522 11  TimeManager                         0x0000fe9d [WorkTimeRootViewController viewControllerdidFinishWithSave]  253 12  TimeManager                         0x00012b73 [AddWorkTimeViewController save]  83 13  UIKit                               0x000384fd [UIApplication sendActiontofromforEvent]  119 14  UIKit                               0x0024acc3 [UIBarButtonItemUIInternal sendActionwithEvent]  156 15  UIKit                               0x000384fd [UIApplication sendActiontofromforEvent]  119 16  UIKit                               0x000c8799 [UIControl sendActiontoforEvent]  67 17  UIKit                               0x000cac2b [UIControlInternal sendActionsForEventswithEvent]  527 18  UIKit                               0x000c97d8 [UIControl touchesEndedwithEvent]  458 19  UIKit                               0x0005cded [UIWindow sendTouchesForEvent]  567 20  UIKit                               0x0003dc37 [UIApplication sendEvent]  447 21  UIKit                               0x00042f2e UIApplicationHandleEvent  7576 22  GraphicsServices                    0x011f6992 PurpleEventCallback  1550 23  CoreFoundation                      0x00f9e944 CFRUNLOOPISCALLINGOUTTOASOURCE1PERFORMFUNCTION  52 24  CoreFoundation                      0x00efecf7 CFRunLoopDoSource1  215 25  CoreFoundation                      0x00efbf83 CFRunLoopRun  979 26  CoreFoundation                      0x00efb840 CFRunLoopRunSpecific  208 27  CoreFoundation                      0x00efb761 CFRunLoopRunInMode  97 28  GraphicsServices                    0x011f51c4 GSEventRunModal  217 29  GraphicsServices                    0x011f5289 GSEventRun  115 30  UIKit                               0x00046c93 UIApplicationMain  1160 31  TimeManager                         0x00001c79 main  121 32  TimeManager                         0x00001bf5 start  53 codepre  pThis is the method where the application crashesp  precode voidviewControlleridcontroller didFinishWithSaveBOOLsave      if save               NSNotificationCenter dnc  [NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter]         [dnc addObserverself selectorselectoraddControllerDidSave nameNSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification objectself.addingManagedObjectContext]          NSError error         if [self.addingManagedObjectContext saveamperror]  it crashes here                      NSLogUnresolved error , , error, [error userInfo]             exit1   Fail                   [dnc removeObserverself nameNSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification objectself.addingManagedObjectContext]           self.addingManagedObjectContext  nil      [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimatedYES]  codepre  pI dont know which more code I should attach, since Im not sure whats causing the problem.

Negative 54630 pIm porting a kernel extentsion to 3264 bit AIX on multiprocessor PowerPC, written in C. I dont need more than atomic read operation and atomic write operations I have no use for fetchandadd, compareandswap etc. Just to clarify to me, atomicity means not only no interleaving, but also visibility across multiple cores. The operations operate on pointers, so operations on int variables are useless to me.p  pIf I declare the variable volatile, the C standard says the variable can be modified by unknown factors and is therefore not subject to optimizations.p  pFrom what I read, it seems that regular reads and writes are supposed to be noninterleaved, and the a hrefhttplxr.freeelectrons.comsourceincludeasmpowerpcatomic.hv2.6.25apowerpc relnofollowlinux kernel soucesa seem to agree. it saysp  precodeasm volatilestwU0X0 1,0  mvgtcounter  ri codepre  pcodestwcode is store word, which is supposedly atomic, but I dont know what the U0X0 means. I do not understand how this assembly instruction imposes visibility. When I compile my kernel extension, std is used for the assignment I want, but it should also be atomic for a 64 bit machine, from what I read. I have very little understanding of the specifics of PowerPC and its instruction set, However I did not find in the assembly listing of the compiled file any memory barrier instructions sync or eieio.p  pThe kernel provides the fetchandaddlp service which can be used to implement atomic read codev  fetchandaddlpampx, 0code, for example.p  pSo my questions arep  ol lipis it enough to declare the variable volatile to achieve read and write atomicity in the sense of visibility and nointerleavingpli lipif the answer to 1 is no, how is such atomicity achievedpli lipwhat is the meaning of U0X0 in the Linux PowerPC atomic implementationpli ol

Negative 54630 pI have an ASP.NET strong1.1strong site and Im uploading a small change, but the page will not refresh. The page was changed 2.5 hours ago. I have tried loading the page in 3 different browsers, so I know the issue is not browser caching. I searched for similar situations on the web and StackOverflow. I have tried changing the query string, deleting the file and uploading again, and changing web.config to try to force a site restart.p  pI even uploaded the file under a different name to make sure there was not another problem. That did work, but I dont want to change all of the links to point to a new page. I even tried using Remote Desktop to log into another computer at another client to check if the cached version of the page is there too... it is. p  pThe site is colocated using shared hosting, and my new client doesnt even know how to find the URL for the administrators panel or who to call for support.p  pUsing a hrefhttpwww.netcraft.comwhats relnofollowWhats that site runninga, I found out what the server is runningp  blockquote   pWindows 2000br   MicrosoftIIS5.0br   ASP.NET v1.1br   F5 BigIPp blockquote  pI know Crummy hostp  pIm sure in a day or so Ill contact support and clear this up, but Ill still want to know how this page is cached.

Negative 54630 pIn my app, I use a service to communicate with our server.

Negative 54630 pFirst off, the disclaimer is Im targeting iOS 5, so that very well may be the source of my issues, but if not...p  pIm trying to write a simple class that manages location updates through CoreLocation. However, I see some pretty strange behavior. I have a custom class which basically wraps CLLocationManager and the delegate methods. This is the interfacep  precodeimport ltFoundationFoundation.hgt import ltCoreLocationCoreLocation.hgt  protocol CLZipCodeFetcherDelegate optional  voiddidReceiveZipCodeNSString zipCode end  interface CLZipCodeFetcher  NSObject ltCLLocationManagerDelegategt      id ltCLZipCodeFetcherDelegategt delegate     CLLocationManager locationManager   property strong, readwrite id ltCLZipCodeFetcherDelegategt delegate property strong, read write CLLocationManager locationManager   voidgetZipCode  end codepre  pand the implementation ignore the zip code related stuff thats what the class is eventually meant to do, but right now Im just trying to get some coordinates back from CoreLocationp  precodeimport CLZipCodeFetcher.h  implementation CLZipCodeFetcher  synthesize delegate, locationManager   id init      self  [super init]     if self  nil          self.locationManager  [[CLLocationManager alloc] init]         self.locationManager.delegate  self         self.locationManager.distanceFilter  10.0f  we dont need to be any more accurate than 10m         self.locationManager.desiredAccuracy  kCLLocationAccuracyThreeKilometers         self.locationManager.purpose  Retrieve zip code          return self      voidgetZipCode      [self.locationManager startUpdatingLocation]      voidlocationManagerCLLocationManager manager didUpdateToLocationCLLocation newLocation fromLocationCLLocation oldLocation      NSLogReceived location      voidlocationManagerCLLocationManager manager didFailWithErrorNSError error      NSLogLocation failed   end codepre  pAnd then I initialize an instance of the class in my view controller and call the methodp  precodeCLZipCodeFetcher zipCodeFetcher  [[CLZipCodeFetcher alloc] init] [zipCodeFetcher getZipCode] codepre  pNow, when I run this, the app takes a moment to load, and then pops up the alert dialog asking for permission to let the app use location services. However, as soon as it appears, it immediately disappears too fast to let me hit the allow or deny button, and nothing happens no delegate methods are called. If I then go into the Location Settings of the device, it indeed shows Off for my app. When I turn it on manually from that screen and then go to try the app again, no alert dialog appears, but still nothing happens. Neither of my debug messages are logged. The behavior is the same on both the simulator and my iPhone 4.p  pSo basically, anyone have any idea why Ive looked through all the similar threads, and many issues were related to memory management, but I dont think thatd be a problem here since ARC should be managing my CLLocationManager object, rightp  pP.S. Also, I did add the CoreLocation framework to my project, and I get no code errors or warnings, but is there anything else I need to do before using CoreLocation in my appp

Negative 54630 pwe have a 32 bit JVM running under 64 bit RHEL5 on a box which has plenty of memory 32G. For different reasons, this process requires a pretty large managed heap and permgen space  currently, it runs with the following VM arguments p  pXmx2200M XXMaxPermSize128M XXCMSClassUnloadingEnabledp  pI have started seeing JVM crashes recently because it  seemingly  ran out of native memory it could not create native threads, or failed to allocate native memory, etc.. These crashes were not directly related to the state of the managed heap, as when those crashes happened the managed heap was 5070 full. I know that the memory reserved for the managed process is close to 2.5 G which leaves not more than 0.5G for the JVM itself, BUT  I dont understand why 0.5 isnt enough for the JVM, even if there is constant GCing going on  the real question is this when I connect to the process using jconsole, then it says that  currentlyp  precodeCommitted virtual memory 3,211,180 kbytes codepre  pWhich is more than 3G.

When I go to the system picker it shows that the AppleTV is selected, and to enable mirroring I have to use the switch here.p  pSo the question is, how can I turn on mirroring in the app when a user selects AirPlay using the app pickerp  pThanksp

Negative 54630 pMy problem is occurring using codeMinGW32w64code with codeGCC 4.6.1codep  pWith older versions of codeGCCcode, the codeObjCcode runtime library was essentially rotten on the vine it was often suggested that the shared library be trashed and to only link with the static library. The library itself only existed as a singular version, codelibobjc.acode.p  pStarting with codeGCC 4.6code, we recieved the all new codeObjCcode runtime library that supports 2.0 features and all that other good stuff. It also introduced both 64 and 32 bit versions of the shared library codelibobjc643.dllcode, codelibobjc3.dllcode, which you can actually link against without issue.p  pA quick look at the static library however reveals just a single file, codelibobjc.acode, and is where my issue comes in attempting to statically link to this library gives a reference undefined error to all runtime library functions.p  pFrankly, I dont know where to go from here and all my searches have turned up nothing useful. Hopefully someone can shed some light on the issue.p  pTo statically link to the library, I tried both codeWl,static lobjccode and when that didnt work, went for codestatic lobjccode to force the application to link everything as a static library. I received the same error in both cases.p

Negative 54630 pIm bored, and decided to write a script for a textbased adventure of mine using bash. Basically, its supposed to animate a typewriter in certain cases for dramatic storytelling. I can do this manually in a file like sop  precodesleep 0.1  echo n h sleep 0.1  echo n e sleep 0.1  echo n l sleep 0.1  echo n l sleep 0.1  echo n o codepre  pAs you can imagine, its dreadfully tedious. Instead, I want to pull characters from a string or file one character at a time, and apply the sleep command to each character.p  pSo far, I have the following, that reads from a file. IFS allows the spaces to retain, but not any other type of whitespace such as newline.p  precodeIFS while read n1 achar do    echo achar done lt aFile codepre  pIs there a way I can use this to get all whitespace As a bonus question, can you tell me how to apply this to a userdefined script, so I dont have to read from a separate file So, for example, lets say I have a string called hello, and I can simply pass it to my function to animate as a typewriter whenever I run my file in the bash terminal.p  pAny help would be appreciated. Thanksp
Negative 54630 pSometimes I am on the lookout for specific logcat messages for debugging purposes and its critical to see exactly when they appear. I then make a logcat filter call it xx in eclipse ready to spot the critical message. I then highlight the xx filter and run my app and look out for my message  nothing appears in my xx filer view  but I notice increasing numbers win brackets next to the All messages no filters. If I then click on the All messages thing and then go back to xx then heypresto my messages are visible. Its almost as if eclipse is determined never to let me see these messages as they arrive. Is there anything I can do about thisp

From the servers point of view, the write to a local, closed socket emsucceedsem, and absent the EPIPE I cant see how the server should be detecting that the client has closed the socket.p  pIn the gap between the client closing its end and the server attempting to write, a call to netstat will show that the connection is in a CLOSEWAITFINWAIT2 state, so the server end should definitely be able to reject the write.p  pFor reference, Im on Debian Squeeze, uname r is 2.6.39bpo.2amd64.p  pWhats going on herep  hr  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltunistd.hgt include ltsystypes.hgt include ltsyswait.hgt include ltsyssocket.hgt include ltsysselect.hgt include ltnetinettcp.hgt include lterrno.hgt include ltstring.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltfcntl.hgt  include ltnetdb.hgt  define SERVERADDRESS 127.0.0.7 define SERVERPORT 4777   define myfailif test, msg  do  iftest fprintfstderr, msg n exit1   while 0 define myfailunless test, msg  myfailif test, msg   int connectclient char addr, int actualport       int clientfd      struct addrinfo hint     struct addrinfo ailist, aip       memset amphint, 0, sizeof struct addrinfo       hint.aisocktype  SOCKSTREAM      myfailif getaddrinfo addr, NULL, amphint, ampailist   0, getaddrinfo failed.       int connected  0     for aip  ailist aip aip  aipgtainext           struct sockaddrin aipgtaiaddrgtsinport  htons actualport          clientfd  socket aipgtaifamily, aipgtaisocktype, aipgtaiprotocol           if clientfd  1  continue          if connect clientfd, aipgtaiaddr, aipgtaiaddrlen  0               connected  1             break                  close clientfd            freeaddrinfo ailist       myfailunless connected, Didnt connect.      return clientfd    void client     sleep1     int clientfd  connectclient SERVERADDRESS, SERVERPORT       printfClient closing its fd...      myfailunless 0  close clientfd , close failed      fprintfstdout, Client exiting.n     exit0    int initserver struct sockaddr  saddr, socklent saddrlen       int sockfd      sockfd  socket saddrgtsafamily, SOCKSTREAM, 0      if  sockfd lt 0          return sockfd           myfailunless bind sockfd, saddr, saddrlen   0, Failed to bind.      return sockfd   int startserver const char  addr, int port       struct addrinfo ailist, aip     struct addrinfo hint     int sockfd      memset amphint, 0, sizeof struct addrinfo       hint.aisocktype  SOCKSTREAM     myfailif getaddrinfo addr, NULL, amphint, ampailist   0, getaddrinfo failed.       for aip  ailist aip aip  aipgtainext          struct sockaddrin aipgtaiaddrgtsinport  htons port          sockfd  initserver aipgtaiaddr, aipgtaiaddrlen          if  sockfd gt 0              break                    freeaddrinfo aip       myfailunless listen sockfd, 2   0, Failed to listen      return sockfd    int serveraccept int serverfd       printfAcceptingn     int clientfd  accept serverfd, NULL, NULL      myfailunless clientfd gt 0, Failed to accept      return clientfd    void server      int serverfd  startserverSERVERADDRESS, SERVERPORT     int clientfd  serveraccept serverfd       printfServer sleepingn     sleep60      printf Errno before sn, strerror errno       printf Write result dn, write clientfd, 123, 3       printf Errno after  sn, strerror errno        close clientfd     int mainvoid     pidt clientpid     pidt serverpid      clientpid  fork      if  clientpid  0           client      else          serverpid  fork          if  serverpid  0               server                  else              int clientstatus             int serverstatus              waitpid clientpid, ampclientstatus, 0              waitpid serverpid, ampserverstatus, 0               printf Client status is d, server status is dn,                      clientstatus, serverstatus                     return 0  codepre

Negative 54630 pIm developing a Java application, that captures video from dvi frame grabber. I want to render the frames, that I get from this frame grabber in the real time. But I faced the problem with the productivity  the rendering was very slow, my computer managed to render only 56 frames per second. Though the device was able to capture up to 40 frames per second. I profiled my code and found that drawImage method was relatively slow. If I called drawImage method with the BMP image, I loaded via ImageIO.readImage, than it took 20 ms to draw it using drawImage. With the images, I got from the frame grabber, It takes more than 100 ms to draw them. I studied the code of the frame grabber library, and found that the BufferedImage was created in the following way  p  precode    ColorModel cm     if format  PixelFormat.RGB24         cm  new ComponentColorModel             ColorSpace.getInstanceColorSpace.CSsRGB, new int[] 8,8,8,             false, false, Transparency.OPAQUE, DataBuffer.TYPEBYTE      else          throw new UnsupportedOperationException          SampleModel sm  cm.createCompatibleSampleModelwidth, height     DataBuffer db  new DataBufferBytepixels, length     WritableRaster raster  Raster.createWritableRastersm, db, null     return new BufferedImagecm, raster, false, null codepre  ppixels is an array of bytes, that is provided by the frame grabber. Is there any way to create BufferedImage differentelely, to make the call to drawImage method faster. I know about ColorSpaces, I do not need to preserve the correct color space. Speed matters much more.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 54630 pIn Delphi XE2, I have a ListView with thumbnails of images. When I click one of the thumbnails, I want the ListView to be covered with a dark semitransparent layer and have the clicked image zoomed on top of this layer.p  pSince it is not possible to put a TImage on top of a ListView, I tried to use another form with AlphaBlend 128 transparency for the layer. However, this AlphaBlend form makes also the TImage on it Alphatransparent.p  pSo the target seems be to make the layer form AlphaBlendtransparent but not the image on it. How can this be achievedp  hr  pEDIT on 7.Aug.2012p  pSOLVED Thanks to Remy Lebeau, who gave me the decisive hint to parenting the image.

Negative 54630 pI have a process that reads data using the Windows 1252 codepage input from a SQL Server 2008 varchar field.  I then write this data to a flat text file, which is picked up by an IBM mainframe system that uses the EBCDIC 37 codepage.  That system converts the file to its own character set.  However, some things in the extended ASCII range char codes 128  255 dont get converted nicely by the mainframe.  I think this is because certain characters in the Windows character set do not exist in the EBCDIC character set.p  pIs there a general way to determine what characters I need to filter out, such as a left single quote, right single quote, left double quote, right double quote, bullet, en dash, and em dash, Windows codes 145  151, respectively, to name a few  If so, is there some algorithm I can use to determine what the closest EBCDIC equivalent might be such as a normal single quote for either a left single quote or a right single quotep

Negative 54630 pI have a CSS and HTML related problem. I have one main div which has a background color and is supposed to be visible. Inside of that I have a wrapper that contains multiple smaller divs. Only one of these children will fit inside the bigger div at one time, but I want the others to align vertically besides it with a scroll bar, so I can scroll between the divs. I do not want the divs thats outside my main div to be visible and expand the site. p  pIve tried to float the to the left, but they only align underneath each other. Even when I set the wrappers div to be auto. But if I set a specific width that will fit all the smaller divs I.e. 7000px, they will align vertically. But even those who is pushed outside if the main div will be visible, and the site is stretched. p  pSo is this possible to do Its like you do with text, when you just want it inside a specific div like here in the text editor, only vertically and with divs. p  pHope someone can help p

Negative 54630 pI have a Grails application that has been working properly with an H2 database for months.  All of the table names and column names are in uppercase.  I switched to MySQL when moving into production and the application stopped working.  Even simple things like counting the number of rows for a table returned 0.  I know that I am successfully connecting to the MySQL database so I dont think that is an issue.p  pWhen I looked at the table contents in a GUI I noticed that additional tables were being created that were named similarly but all lowercase instead of uppercase.  So my good data is all under Table FOO but my Grails app is looking in foo which is empty according to the Hibernate queries that are dumped to the console.  I did not change anything in my Grails settings other than the url which was updated to point to the MySQL database instead of the H2 database, the driver class com.mysql.jdbc.Driver,and the dialect org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialectp  pThe application is also doing the same thing to the column names.  I checked my MySQL server settings and My lowercasetablenames variable is set to 0.p  pDoes anyone have an idea what the problem could bep

The relevant code is as followsp  precode    if handledThisTouch ampamp pTouchEvent.getAction  TouchEvent.ACTIONUP return          if pTouchEvent.getAction  TouchEvent.ACTIONDOWN              if currentText.getCharactersVisible lt currentText.getCharactersToDraw                  handledThisTouch  true                 currentText.setCharactersPerSecond500              else if currentText.getCharactersVisible gt currentText.getCharactersToDraw                     ampamp handledThisTouch  true                  handledThisTouch  true                 departWorldScene.HUDTYPE.INTERFACE              else                   we shouldnt be here.                       if pTouchEvent.getAction  TouchEvent.ACTIONUP handledThisTouch  false codepre  pCouple comments about whats happening here.  TickerText and its superclass Text dont have a getCharactersToDraw method.  It uses that variable internally and I added it to make it possible to check whether the text was done displaying.  Second, theres no built in method to autocomplete the ticker, so Im simply setting the characterspersecond to an arbitrarily high number 500sec to simulate the effect.  That was recommended on the AndEngine forum.p  pWhen I run this, it workssomewhat.  But every 1 in 5 times or so I get a Fatal Signal 11 SIGSEGV at 0x67079004 code1, thread 4466.  Theres no stack trace or anything to help me further.  Also, every so often the rendering just goes berserk, drawing letters stretched out across the screen, etc.p  pAny guesses whats going on andor how to fix itp  hr  pUPDATE  For reasons I cant fathom, the error seemed to stop happening.  Dont think I changed anything relevant.  This is disconcerting, but oh well.   If anyone has any information on Fatal Signal 11 in general itd be appreciated.p

I have previously worked with SOAP services, which had a decent WSDL and I used it to generate my Java classes to which my client app was marshalling the service data using Axiom2.p  pMy question is  is there an easy way to reverse engineer a WADL with which to easily generate corresponding Java classes if the site is lacking one, using some implementation of JAXRS e.g. Jersey  Another way to ask it is  given only a REST service, no WADL, and some form of JAXRS, what is the easiest way to generate marshalled classes on the client sidep  pCurrently, as the structure is simple, I do it the hard way of using straight DOM from Java SE codeorg.w3c.domcode to parse the document.  It works fine but I do not like all the traversing I have to do within the document structure and I feel like I reinvented the wheel.  I am sure there is a more elegant way.p

Negative 54630 pWhen developing the application against my local database there were no problems with the speed of transactions, although the CPU usage was constantly at about 30 percents when performing several transactions per second, and when profiling most of the time was spent in javax methods handling the transactions with an average of 2.6 seconds per transaction. Therefore Im using an ArrayList as a buffer and only sending the transaction when the size of the buffer exceeds 300 instances, which significantly lowered the CPU usage.p  pWhen Im changing my persistence.xml to use a remote database instead checked both RDS and a personal, offsite database the minimum time for persistingcommitting a batch of instances is about 20 seconds, which is too high since a transaction of 300 instances is required once every 5 seconds on average.p  pIve tried to change the flushmode of the EntityManager to codeFlushModeType.COMMITcode but it didnt change the performance noticeably. Increasing the size of the buffer before sending causes a stack overflow with the javax.persistence library for some to me unknown reason.p  pstrongpersistence.xmlstrongp  precodeltpersistenceunit namePUdata transactiontypeRESOURCELOCALgt     ltmappingfilegtMETAINForm.xmlltmappingfilegt     ...  class, sharedcachemodenone, validationmodenone ...     ltpropertiesgt         ...

Cant see what version of MySQL, its the latest March 2013. p  pGot a backup of remote MySQL database taken with phpAdmin and downloaded as a zip to Mac.p  pThe problem is that using phpAdmin on my Mac I simply cant get the MySQL database installed locally. p  pI have tried an Import without first setting up a database locally. I was  expecting the import to bring along both the data and the database tables. However the result of an Import is a blank page in phpAdmin with no feedback as to what has happened.p  pI then created a local database to receive the remote backup file. After creating, this shows up in phpAdmin as being without tables, as expected.p  pThe result is the same. A white page in phpAdmin with nothing to show what has happened.p  pDoes this all mean that to install the backup database locally I first have to create a mirror image on my Mac with all tables defined This will be a very tedious exercise if so.p  pIm obviously missing some vital step in the process.

Negative 54630 pI have to monitor all the frames on a network. For this, Ive created 2 codeListViewscode, one for showing the frame names, dlcs, payloads and timestamp.

Negative 54630 pIm a bit of a newbie in iOS programming, and have recently tried out some stuff with AVAudioRecorder and AVAudioPlayer, and happend on some strange bugs.p  pBasicaly what happened was that my app bugged out so hard it broke my iPhones iPhone 4 audiorecording capabilities. And Im not just talking about my app not being able to record anymore, none of the apps I tried, such as Vociememo and recording a movie using the standardcameraapp, where not able to record audio video for the camera worked fine anymore.p  pThe problem can only be resolved by restarting the iPhone.p  pSince Im a newbie I dont know a lot about these things and if it happens frequently One app bugging out causing problems for other apps or if this is something I should report as a bug to Apple.p  pIt was my understanding that the sandbox made sure that even though your app bugged out, this wouldnt affect others, but I may be wrong. So my question is Does this happen often should I report itp  pFor those interested please ask for more info, but it basicaly has to do with sending prepareToPlay to the player but instead begin recordingp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 54630 pA friend and I are writing some software as a side project and are having trouble with ArrayLists.p  pWere storing a collection of instances of a custom object containing a DateTime and two strings in an ArrayList. Once weve stored all of the entries in the ArrayList, were sorting them by DateTime. The problem is, that were having to store of 100,000 instances of the object, which means that the built in sort method is taking a very long time  we clocked it at over an hour, at one point.p  pThe speed of the sort isnt so much of an issue, but I was just wondering whether there was a better way to sort elements in an ArrayList than using the built in sort method. Although I guess not, based on the fact that the built in .net stuff will be highly optimised.p  pNote Were using ArrayLists because of the middleware weve chosen to use for generating PDF reports, based on the content of the ArrayList. I guess, if we had the chance to move over to Listlt then the sort methods would be better. Or would theyp  pEditp  pBased on requests for source code, Ill post some. But Im not sure how much I can provide that isnt obvious.p  precodepublic class DataObject  ICompareable     private DateTime timeStamp    private string description    private string detail     public DataObject DataTime inTimeStamp, string inDescription,                       string inDetail           this.timeStamp  inTimeStamp       this.description  inDescription       this.detail  inDetail         int IComparable.CompareToobject that            DataObject myThat  DataObjectthat        return this.timestamp.CompareTomyThat.timestamp         ....

Were pulling data from several places in an SQLCEME3.5 database were using .net 3.5, so we cant use LINQ, placing them in an ArrayList of objects and using that object ArrayList further down the pipe.p  pWe want to get all the records from multiple places in the database some are packets, some are strings prompts, some are other types, all parse down to strings and sort them all by time stamp. We want all the data interspersed  a packet followed by some string value, followed by some object value, if thats the order that they were storedraised in.p  pWe have readonly access to the database, so I dont think that using the database, itself to sort them would be a good idea or even possible. That being said, I am really new to SQL  never used it before this project. Can that be donep

Im not sure if this is the right way at all. Should I be doing this by rendering the context in a django template  If so, how would something like that look like inside a jQueryajax success handlerp  pIt seems like going from a dict to a highcharts series with the aforementioned format with the dict key as the x and dict value as the y  would be something that many folks have done so I think Im missing something.p

Negative 54630 pI have a custom control, that is entirely dependent on jquery plugins. Everything is working fine as it is supposed to, but the problem arises when the control is set Visible  false or any of its parents is not Visible. Ideally, when an asp.net control is set Visible false, the engine doesnt render it, so my control is not being rendered on the page load. And when the control doesnt render, it does not load javascript resources, and hence jquery plugins dont bind when the control shows up on postback. This is a very basic problem, and as the developers, which are supposed to use it, they are just going to drag and drop the control on their pages, assuming it is working perfectly. I think there must be a work around for it. Pasted below is how I am loading resources.p  precodeClientScriptManager cs  this.Page.ClientScript  region Loading JavaScript Files string MenuPlugin  MainMenuControl.Scripts.javascriptmain.js cs.RegisterClientScriptResourcetypeofMainMenuControl.MenuControl, MenuPlugin string MenuInitializer  MainMenuControl.Scripts.BuildMenu.js cs.RegisterClientScriptResourcetypeofMainMenuControl.MenuControl, MenuInitializer endregion  region Loading CSS Files string cssUrl  Page.ClientScript.GetWebResourceUrlthis.GetType, MainMenuControl.Styles.MenuStyle.css HtmlLink cssLink  new HtmlLink cssLink.Href  cssUrl cssLink.Attributes.Addrel, stylesheet cssLink.Attributes.Addtype, textcss this.Page.Header.Controls.AddcssLink endregion  region Loading Images Page.ClientScript.GetWebResourceUrltypeofMainMenuControl.MenuControl, MainMenuControl.Images.down.gif string script  string.FormatinitializeMenu0, Page.ClientScript.GetWebResourceUrltypeofMainMenuControl.MenuControl, MainMenuControl.Images.down.gif Page.ClientScript.RegisterStartupScriptPage.GetType, InitImage, script, true endregion codepre  pIn the third last line of the code, I am calling a function with an image url that is loaded correctly.

Negative 54630 pI have written an ActiveX Control in CATL. In the ACtiveX Control, there are 2 threads, the main thread, and another thread to handle IO communications.p  pI call the WriteFile API to write to serial port in the the background thread.

However, if I press F5in Visual Studio, nothing will happen and the code will just finish execution. p  pWhen I put the WriteFile on the main thread, everything works fine.

Negative 54630 pIm creating an application in Swing using MVC architecture. But I have some concerns regarding the use of JTable components in MVC architecture. The point is that, I have three columns in a table whose cells contain constant values. Also, other columns can be added by clicking on the button, and another button used to calculate constant values into those new created cells. p  pSo, since I now have the three columns with constant values, this means that this values need to be initialized into JTable, which sounds like I need to make those constant inside a View class where I have created a JTable component and other components, which is a bad idea, because those constant values I will need to use also for Model class. My alternative was to make the interface with these constants. p  pI was watching some other simple examples of MVC projects, and I havent seen anyone yet that implements or create this constants inside a view class. So Im wonder, should I create an MyTableModel class inside a Model, which extends DefaultTableModel or something like that, but If I decide to use a model class in a view class, Im breaking the rule  It doesnt know the View existsp  pHas anyone already made a similar project using the MVC pattern and JTable component, or if someone can break up into concepts, like On what should I pay more attention, Where can I create and where not classesp  pDoes anyone use Skype or similar form of communication, I dont really mean to being boring, just to have someone to ask some quick and short questions.p

Negative 54630 pI am utilizing Devexpress Gridview and I am having a caching problem. p  pI have developed a page like here a hrefhttpmvc.devexpress.comGridViewSimpleCustomBinding relnofollowhttpmvc.devexpress.comGridViewSimpleCustomBindingap  pIt is working as it is supposed to be. However, if I update a column value in the database Mssql, Gridview does not change the value. p  pSearched the web and found EnableRowsCache must be false but I could not implemented it since I think this property is available for different kind or version of Gridview and We have been using MVC extensions.p  pDoes anybody know how to disable cache and make it show the fresh datap  pstrong UPDATE strongp  pAfter a lot of digging and searching, it is clear now that the caching is not due to devexpress, but it is the result of linq to sql. It is a property of linq that it caches the results of view and does not show the updated value. p

Negative 54630 pI have a Spring bean that needs information from the request, but isnt directly called from the controller although it could be  but Id like to try this without itp  pBasically, my API makes requests to other services over thrift. When it makes the request, theres a service call like thisp  precodeauthenticationService.authenticatenull, username, password codepre  pThe first parameter the codenullcode is usually a placeholder instance of a request context. The request context contains information about the user making the request, the originating IP, etc. This way, I get all of the details about the original caller without letting my API infrastructure leak into the backend.p  pHowever, to do this, I have an codeInvocationHandlercode that intercepts method calls made against a proxy of my service interfaces. Inside of that proxy handler, I have a codeRequestContextFactorycode wired in that creates instances of a codeRequestContextcode. Inside of this factory, I need to get information from the request.

Negative 54630 pWhy do we need a 2nd mechanism, next to e.g. The forms authentication mechanism, to keep the state  I have quite a good understanding as to why session tokens are used. I also understand the forms authentication mechanism. What i dont understand is why we need the two.p  pAs the formsauth cookie is unique, we could use this to track the users state, right I feel this would be a lot safer we track the state, and we know the user is authenticated. Ive googled a lot, and often people say that, in asp, it is good practice to link sessionid and authentication token together... That is actually the same as just using one of the two for both, nop  pOne situation where i can think of where we need anonymous state, is in an application where the user does not necessarily need to log in. But then again, we have anonymous authentication, rightp

Negative 54630 pI have a graph with positive edge weights and positive node weights.

How should I go about solving this problem Are there any standard algorithms I should look atp  pMy modified Dijkstra is as follows At each node I record the shortest path so far, and also the maximum node weight Ive seen so far, and use that to calculate the length to neighboring nodes. Please see my comment for the details.p  pHeres a graph where Dijkstra fails a hrefhttpi.imgur.comFQhRzXV.jpg relnofollowhttpi.imgur.comFQhRzXV.jpga The numbers in green are the node labels.

The problem with Dijkstra is that the node 4 always records the path 1894 since its shorter than path 1234 former length 9 vs latter length 13. But to reach node 7, path 1894567 is longer than 1234567.p

The site will have a user login system that will allow an Admin user to manipulate permissions for all other users in the system. The system would have those basic permissions like view, edit, create and remove and maybe a few additional ones. Moreover, these permissions would be grouped by a users role. So for example, the permissions of create, edit, delete and view would be associated to a manager role in the system, but a nonmanager role would just be associated to the permission view.pli lipstrong[What I have been investigating]strong One idea that I have been digging     into is the use of Access Control Lists.

On the encrypting end Im doing the same, with a randomly generated Salt.p  pIs that an industry standard  Or if I send this to someone with a different product, will they likely not be able to decrypt my files even though the password we derive everything from might be the samep  pAlso as a side note, is this a secure way to generate the iv  Are there any other security concernsp  pThis question is the result of conversations with an outside entity that has given me a key instead of a password.  Wouldnt that make the salt redundant, since there will be no variation in keyp

Negative 54630 pWe are having some issues with our .NET app pooling connections to a SQL database, it seems like we are getting a connection leak but not sure where.p  pWe load our POCOs from a SQL server DB using a data class which has a private IDbCommand variable and a private data reader variable.  When making a call to the DB we start by passing both into a SQLAccess class which creates the connection, opens it , assigns the connection to the IDbCommands connection property and returns. p  pOnce back in the data class we use the connection to hydrate the POCO and then call Reader.close and IDbCommand.Connection.Dispose. However, when viewing the number of connections SQL has it continues to go up and up until it hits 100 and then it blows up. The connection string is hardcoded and so is the same every time. I cant understand why .NET isnt closinghandling the connections in a better way.

Negative 54630 pSo, the inverse of this question has been asked before and answered here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7276989howtosetthecontextpathofawebapplicationintomcat70HOWTO set the context path of a web application in Tomcat 7.0a. However, my application is deployed as ROOT and I need it to be available at mypath instead of deploying it at mypath and needing it available at ROOT. Im trying out Amazons Elastic Beanstalk offering and a deployed war will always go to ROOT. I dont have any control over this and there is not .war file left behind. I tried to aforementioned topic to solve my problem, but it seems that pointing ROOT to another path doesnt work, while pointing another path to ROOT does work. p  pI will have to create an AMI so that auto scaling can take place without me touching new instances. The only thing I have been able to do to get this working was to create a symbolic link in the webapps folder that points mypath to ROOT. I have no idea if there are significant repercussions of this setup and would like to hear if there are and what alternative there may be that makes use of Tomcats settings instead or even another nonTomcat solution. p  pThanks p  pUpdate Once I created the AWS AMI with a symbolic link in the webapps folder and actually changed the AMI in Elastic Beanstalk, I found that my original solution will not work because Beanstalk wipes out the entire webapps directory.p

Negative 54630 pI encountered a problem that I fixed but I cant understand why the fix works and the original code doesnt work. Its the easiest to explain it with codep  pIve got the following method in my entityBackingBean entityBBp  precodepublic void standardLetterInitLetter entity      setEntityentity  codepre  pAnd the following in my xhtml pagep  precodelthcommandLink actionListenerentityBB.standardLetterInitvarEntitygt codepre  pThis commandLink is situated in a datatable that contains varEntity as var.p  pThe above code works, but does something strange when using the back button on the keyboard. If you click on the commandlink, the entity has the selected value in the backingBean. If you then press back and click on another commandlink, then the entity still has got the value from the previous click.  How can that bep  pI used the following as solution, but cant understand the difference between the 2 approachesp  precode lthcommandLink actionListenerentityBB.standardLetterInitgt     ltfsetPropertyActionListener targetentityBB.entity valuevarEntity gt  lthcommandLinkgt codepre  pand in my entityBackingBean entityBBp  precodepublic void standardLetterInit      without setEntity     rest of method  codepre  pEDITp  pI have just noticed the following If I add any parameter to the standardLetterInit method, even a boolean.. Then the entity does not change. Im even more confused now.p
Negative 54630 pI have installed smlmode in emacs 24. I want to compile the code directly in emacs with PolyML how do I do that I have installed PolyML and then typed smlpolyml in order to start the interpreter but i says no match.

I think i should put autoload smlpolyml smlpolyml Set up and run PolyML. t in .emacs.d What is emacs lisp files I seems to need smlpolyml.el and dont know if that is included in smlmode as standard Then Im stuck...p
Negative 54630 pstrongThe short of it....strongp  pI have a JAXWS service residing on a web server using SSL and requiring mutual authentication.  p  pFirst to test that mutual authentication is working properly, I import the client certificate into the browser.  I then point the browser to the protected site and it successfully connects and retrieves content.  p  pThen I wrote the java code to connect to the service on the same web site.  I import the same certificate into a java keystore file jks, I receive a TLSv1 Alert fatal, handshakefailure.p  pI did a p  precodeDjavax.net.debugsslhandshake codepre  pand found that the strongClientHellostrong and strongServerHellostrong were successfull.  Then it proceeds to do the strongClientKeyExchangestrong, and I see the SESSION KEYGEN.  Then it goes to strongCertificateVerifystrong and that is when the fatal, handshakefailure occurs.p  pI am at a loss for why the browser works and the java application does not.p  pI am running on Java 1.6.045, though I have tried this same code on Java 7 to the same result.p  pSee below for more details.p  hr  pstrongThe long of it....strongp  pThis is long, I include my code for loading the key and truststores and I finally include the javax.net.debug output.p  pTo support the loading of the keystore and truststore dynamically, I created a Custom SocketFactory.p  precode    public

Negative 54630 pI have a codeNSWindowControllercode as part of the work flow with codeNSDocumentcode.  The codeNSWindowControllercode has an associated xib with a couple of codeNSTableViewscode.  The datasource for these tableviews is a model defined by the codeNSDocumentcode.  I seem to be missing some information on setting up the outlets.  If I setup all the outlets within IB, the datasources are created at the time the nib is instantiated with their default init methods, which dont know about the model.  By the time codeawakeFromNibcode is called, the datasource has already been queried by the tableview codenumberOfRowsInTableViewcode.  My workaround is to not hook up the outlets for datasource.  I get the model information in setDocument and set the delegates in codewindowDidLoadcode.  This seems to work.  How do I pass around a data model when setting the tableview datasource with IB  Since the outlets are not created when init is called within the tableview datasource, how would I call out to get the modelp  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 54630 pI have a structured data file consisting of header lines interspersed with blocks of data. I am reading each block of data as defined by the header line into a separate cell of a cell array. For instance, suppose that after loading the data with codetextscancode, I have a cell array codexcode and an array of indices of header lines and EOF codeheaderIdxcode of the following formp  precodexheader line 198.7874399.3971799.93578100.40125100.79166101.10525101.34037101.49553101.56939101.56072101.4685101.29184101.03002100.68249header line 2100.2488799.7289799.1227498.4303697.6521596.7886495.84054header line 33.24.312.74.69.3 headerIdx[1162430] codepre  pI then attempt to extract each block of data below a header line into a separate element of a cell array using codesscanfcode and codestr2matcode as suggested by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma21794549873757this posta. Initially, this approach failed because the elements within a given block of data were of different length. This can be solved by including a numerical flag for the codefcode argument to help codesscanfcode know where to delimit the input data as suggested by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma21838371873757this posta. One can then use a strategy such as the following to effect the conversion of structured data to a cell array of blockspecific double arraysp  precodeextractdata  n sscanfstr2matxheaderIdxn1headerIdxn11.,[ num2strsizestr2matxheaderIdxn1headerIdxn11.,1 f] extracteddata  arrayfunextractdata,1numelheaderIdx1,UniformOutput,false codepre  pThe numerical flag of the format string can either be set to something arbitrarily large to encompass all the data, or can be set on a blockspecific basis as I have done in the example above. The latter approach leads to redundant evaluation of codestr2matcode once for the input to codesscanfcode and once for the input to the codefcode string generator. Can this redundancy be avoided without using loop statements that store the output of the codestr2matcode command in a temporary variable Note that one cannot simply take the output of the codesizecode command applied to the output of codestr2matx.code on the entire data set because the header lines are generally going to be the lines with the greatest number of characters.p  pFinally, I have constructed the codexcode matrix above to reflect the fact that some blocks of data may have different precision than other blocks. This is the reason to set the format string in a blockspecific manner. My testing has shown that despite accurate construction of a blockspecific format string code[ num2strsizestr2matxheaderIdxn1headerIdxn11.,1 f]code, the data in all elements of the resulting cell array codeextracteddatacode are ultimately forced to have the same precision see below.

Negative 54630 pQuestion in my book is asking What restrictions are placed on instance variable and static variable access from within the definition of 1. An instance method 2. A static methodp  pIs my response to this concept correctp  pAn instance method cannot directly access the instance variable while a static variable can be directly accessed since one copy is used throughout the class. Each object will share this static variable as well as the static methods in the class. An instance variable is only available to each object and each object has its own copy of this instance variable.  A static method cannot access instance members of the class. A static method can however access members of the static variable.p

Negative 54630 pI got advice that its good to implement Checkers using bitboards. After I read this tutorial a hrefhttpwww.3dkingdoms.comcheckersbitboards.htm relnofollowhttpwww.3dkingdoms.comcheckersbitboards.htma Im a bit confused. I understand that bitboards are very effective cause it allows me to compute every possible move for a single player in just a few logical operations. But what good is of that I cant even tell which piece moved where by the result of that operation. Latter, when it comes to development of AI, I will need tree of possible moves so I can determine which move is best.p  pThe only good I can see of this is that it can speed up some heuristics algorithms.p  pAnyone had some experience with thisp

Negative 54630 pI have several embedded hardware system in the field that update to a server with a central database. My next step is to manage the database through a web interface so records can be viewed and displayed as required.p  pMy plan thus far has been to install AMPPS and wordpress. However I am not sure where to begin when writing custom pages on a wordpress install. I have created the four pages I require but i am now at a loss on how to edit these pages so I can do PHP queries on the database and had users modify some of the records.p  pIf anyone could point me to some wordpress and PHP resources that focus on working with wordpress at a deeper level as opposed to customising themes and installing plugins I would be very grateful.p
Negative 54630 pIm trying to figure out how to take an initial data table, apply multiple category filters to it, and illustrate ema combination of simple and summary statisticsem of the resulting data subset through pie charts and bar graphs.p  pIve created a sample script out of the Google dependentfilters example that will help explain. In a nutshell, this dataset has two countries USA and France with two regions each New YorkCalifornia and IledeFranceProvence. The population of each region is broken down into four components Dark Blue, Light Blue, Dark Green, and Light Green. p  pHeres what I want when selections are made from the two category filters for country and region e.g., USA amp New York, I want a a bar chart that shows the populations of the four population groups in that region b a pie chart that shows the twoway split between Darks and Lights in that region using two slices, labeled Dark and Light and c a pie chart that shows the twoway split between Blues and Greens in that region also using two slices, labeled Blue and Green. p  pGetting a is simple enough, but I cant figure out the right approach for b and c. I dont need to do more than one region at once e.g., select USA and leave the region filter open, and get summary stats for New York and Cali combined. All I need is to take four rows of data from one region and produce three charts.p  pIve started experimenting with adding calculated columns in the dataview but then I realized that the number of emrowsem needs to change, so simply appending an extra column isnt all thats needed. I need to take the fourrow dataview given to me by the category filters and somehow transform it into tworow dataviews that sum up the fourrow view, and do it in different ways for each pie chart. Problem is, I have no idea how to do this, and the Internet isnt helping.  p  pHeres the patch of code Ive been staring at for hours. Ive lost some of my prior experimentation  Ive been playing mostly with the pie chart view sections, but after getting nowhere I reverted them to the same view as the bar chart and forgot to save a draft  so Im not sure how helpful its going to be.

Negative 54630 pI need a 2D array which is expandable in all directions and strictly tracks overall positioning of each element, but is most efficient at read.p  pThe use case I face is as follows I am colliding and mashing 2D tectonic plates into one another. When they collide, they can shrink, grow, or neither. Every iteration, all elements are likely to be accessed, so read time is very important. They must be able to growshrink on all sides as well, and can contain holes and convex structures. p  pMemory is not a huge issue, but Id like to save it where I can. My main concern is speed, as the old proof of concept this is loosely based on written in C takes 15 minutes to run, and I am adding substantially to the original concept.p  pI initially thought of using a dictionary with coordinates, but this poses the issue of read times dictionaries are slow when something they do not have a key for is requested, and this will happen often.p  pIm considering using a codeListltListltMyCLassgtgtcode structure now, using null class objects for empty locations.p  pAnother idea I had was to use an algebraic array y  stride  x, but would rather avoid the complications thereof, and it would be both hard to build and maintain.p  pSo, essentially, what is the best way to have a very large 2D data set which is constantly accessed and frequently modified in Cp  pEDIT As requested The arrays will likely be between 50x50 and 1000x1000 each, and there will be 1030 at any given time. the overall world will be 512x512 to 4096x4096 in size set at start of simulation, with approximately 20 overlap max excluding edge cases. However, up to 50 of each 2D plate will be empty space in a Cartesian system, so with a uniform size this would mean the actual size of arrays would be double that, so at most, approximately 20,132,659 nonnull array elements, and a little less than that in null elements total in the simulation.p  pIm OK with this program taking up to several hours to complete a sim, but I worry that it will take days. Thats why I am trying to come up with optimal ways to handle these data sets.p

Negative 54630 pI just started learning CUDA, and I am confused by one point. For the sake of argument, imagine that I had several hundred buoys in the ocean. Imagine that they broadcast a stdvector intermittently once every few milliseconds. The vector might be 5 readings, or 10 readings, etc, depending on the conditions in the ocean at that time. There is no way to tell when the event will fire, it is not deterministic.p  pImagine that I had the idea that I could predict the temperature from gathering all this information in realtime, but that the predictor had to first sort all stdvectos on temperature accross all buoy. My question is this. Do I have to copy the entire data back to the GPU every time a single buyoy fires an event Since the other buoys data has not changed, can I leave that data in the GPU and just update what has changed and ask the kernel to rerun the predictionp  pIf yes, what is the [thrust pseudo]code that would do this  Is this best done with streams and events and pinned memory What is the limit as to how fast I can update the GPU with realtime datap  pI was told that this sort of problem is not well suited to GPU and better in FPGA.p

Negative 54630 pIm using Windows Workflow 4.0 and have a simple workflow where in a sequence I have a ForEach activity which contains another ForEach activity that contains a child activity that performs some action on a remote client. p  pI am capturing Activity Scheduled tracking records as well as pretty much every other tracking record type.p  pMy goal is to use these activity scheduled tracking records to create a page where I show each activity and how long it took executing similar to how the TFS build information screen looks.p  pMy issue is that when looking at the child activity ids for the ForEach children theyre assigned the same Id for each iteration of the loop. Therefore I cannot accurately match up any tracking events to a specific child. In other words, the child of the nested ForEach does remote processing which generates logs that are tied to the activity id. I cannot match those logs with a specific activity within the loop.p  pIs there something Im missing I thought activity id was supposed to be unique throughout the workflow.p

Negative 54630 pHere is code that I use to create a loopall and stop button.  However, I have a bug.  If you tap the loopall button it plays fine, and when you hit the stop button, it stops the audio.  But when I tap the loopall button, the audio plays as usual, but when I step out of the program i.e., hit the back button and come back in, the stop button doesnt stop the audio.  To stop it, I had to go to task manager and end the program.  It is the only way to stop it in that situation.  How can I fix this  Anyone have any ideas  Any help would be appreciated.p  precodepublic class OneGrammar extends ActionBarActivity   private ListView lv private MediaPlayer mp private MediaPlayer mp2 int[] myAudio  R.raw.g1100, R.raw.g1101, R.raw.g1102, R.raw.g1103, R.raw.g1104, R.raw.g1105,         R.raw.g1106, R.raw.g1107, R.raw.g1108, R.raw.g1109, R.raw.g1110, R.raw.g1111, R.raw.g1112,          R.raw.g1113, R.raw.g1114, R.raw.g1115 int mCompleted  0  Override protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState      super.onCreatesavedInstanceState     setContentViewR.layout.onegrm      Button btnLoop  Button findViewByIdR.id.button1     Button btnStop  Button findViewByIdR.id.button2      btnStop.setOnClickListenernew View.OnClickListener           Override         public void onClickView v               TODO Autogenerated method stub             if mp2  null                   if mp2.isPlaying                      mp2.stop                                   mp2.reset                 mp2.release                 mp2  null                                     btnLoop.setOnClickListenernew OnClickListener             Override         public void onClickView arg0               mp2  MediaPlayer.creategetBaseContext, myAudio[0]             mp2.setOnCompletionListenernew OnCompletionListener                               Override                 public void onCompletionMediaPlayer mp2                                      mCompleted                     mp2.reset                     if mCompleted lt myAudio.length                                               try                                                      AssetFileDescriptor afd  getResources.openRawResourceFdmyAudio[mCompleted]                             if afd  null                                                               mp2.setDataSourceafd.getFileDescriptor, afd.getStartOffset, afd.getLength                                 afd.close                                 mp2.prepare                                 mp2.start                                                                               catch Exception ex                                                      ex.printStackTrace                                                                     else if mCompleted  myAudio.length                                               mCompleted 0                         try                                                      AssetFileDescriptor afd  getResources.openRawResourceFdmyAudio[mCompleted]                             if afd  null                                                               mp2.setDataSourceafd.getFileDescriptor, afd.getStartOffset, afd.getLength                                 afd.close                                 mp2.prepare                                 mp2.start                                                                               catch Exception ex                                                      ex.printStackTrace                                                                   else                                              mCompleted0                          mp2.release                          mp2  null                                                                   mp2.start                   codepre

Negative 54630 pI have a webapp which Im trying to deploy to OpenShift, which serves historical plots of market data. The MySQL database is around 600MB and has 12,000,000 rows over about 6 tables. If I deploy and run the app, it may run at most a couple minutes, but then it crashes with exceptions related to null database connections. I tried restarting mysql and looking at the quota 750MB of 1024MB to no avail. If I reduce the database size drastically, the webapp runs fine. So far a couple hours with no crashes. I also have another webapp on OpenShift that uses a small MySQL database that runs just fine.p  pFrom what I could tell from reading the documentation is that a gear provides up to 1 GB of storage, and Im under that amount. If I lower my data footprint drastically, MySQL behaves fine.

Negative 54630 pin c I have 2 group boxes with 3 radio buttons of primary color choices red, blue, and yellow. I have it set that when I click a button called Mix it takes the choices from the radio buttons and changes the form background color. i.e blue and yellow selected button click makes form background green, blue and blue makes background blue etc. My problem is that when I click the radio button called rdbRed in group box 1 and select any of the other colors from group box 2 it does nothing. No error codes just nothing.  The values for it and other buttons are set exactly the same, and this is the only button that does nothing. In the code it is rdbRed.

I am having trouble finding out how to switch back to MAMP PRO installation when Im working with PHP.

Most questions have related to using MAMP with RoR. Some advice on whether having 2 installs of MySQL on the same Mac is possiblea reasonable thing to do would be appreciated.p

I could navigate to each codenodecode of the B tree and make codeint nodegtnumkeyscode go to codeint indexgtmcode, codebool nodegtisleafcode could help fulfill codebool indexgtflagcode with some thinking and codeint  nodegtkeyscode go to codeint  indexgtkcode.

Negative 54630 pI am making a BlackJack game in JavaFX. So far, everything is smooth. The only thing missing is that the game should stop and the player should bust when the total value of cards is over 21, like the real game. I added an if statement in my code. Good new is, the if statement executes. Bad news is, it executes AFTER the total value is over 21. So the player can still hit when the value is 23. The if statement will then not execute. It executes when the player hits again, and 23 becomes 25 for example. p  pI hope I explained it well, otherwise please give me feedback. p  pHere is my code p  precode    public class FXMLDocumentController implements Initializable       private int playerValue, dealerValue, playerTotal, dealerTotal          Random ran  new Random     FXML     private TextArea dealerArea     FXML     private TextArea playerArea     FXML     private Label labelPlayerTotal     FXML     private Label labelDealerTotal     FXML     private Label labelWinner     FXML     private Button hitButton     FXML     private Button stayButton     FXML     private Button replayButton          public void drawCardForPlayerActionEvent event           stayButton.setDisablefalse         playerValue  ran.nextInt14          while playerValue lt1              playerValue  ran.nextInt14                            I created this broken if statement         if playerTotal gt21               labelWinner.setTextYou busted, dealer won             hitButton.setDisabletrue             stayButton.setDisabletrue                            switch playerValue           case 2             playerArea.appendTextt  Deck.drawTwo             playerTotal  2  playerTotal             labelPlayerTotal.setTextPlayertotal  playerTotal             break          case 3             playerArea.appendTextt  Deck.drawThree              playerTotal  3  playerTotal             labelPlayerTotal.setTextPlayertotal  playerTotal             break          case 4             playerArea.appendTextt  Deck.drawFour              playerTotal  4  playerTotal             labelPlayerTotal.setTextPlayertotal  playerTotal             break          case 5             playerArea.appendTextt  Deck.drawFive              playerTotal  5  playerTotal             labelPlayerTotal.setTextPlayertotal  playerTotal             break          case 6             playerArea.appendTextt  Deck.drawSix              playerTotal  6  playerTotal             labelPlayerTotal.setTextPlayertotal  playerTotal             break          case 7             playerArea.appendTextt  Deck.drawSeven             playerTotal  7  playerTotal             labelPlayerTotal.setTextPlayertotal  playerTotal             break          case 8             playerArea.appendTextt  Deck.drawEight              playerTotal  8  playerTotal             labelPlayerTotal.setTextPlayertotal  playerTotal             break          case 9             playerArea.appendTextt  Deck.drawNine             playerTotal  9  playerTotal             labelPlayerTotal.setTextPlayertotal  playerTotal             break          case 11             playerArea.appendTextt  Deck.drawJack             playerTotal  10  playerTotal             labelPlayerTotal.setTextPlayertotal  playerTotal             break         case 12             playerArea.appendTextt  Deck.drawQueen              playerTotal  10  playerTotal             labelPlayerTotal.setTextPlayertotal  playerTotal             break         case 13             playerArea.appendTextt  Deck.drawKing             playerTotal  10  playerTotal             labelPlayerTotal.setTextPlayertotal  playerTotal             break         case 14             playerArea.appendTextt  Deck.drawAce             playerTotal  11  playerTotal             labelPlayerTotal.setTextPlayertotal  playerTotal             break              default             break                           codepre  pI debugged it and realized that the value of playerTotal is 0 at first, and the value of playerTotal is only initialized in the switchcase, and that is causing the issue.

Negative 54630 pim having a little trouble with making a dynamic matrix of structs. With dynamic matrix, what i mean is not a fixed number of columns or lines.

In case that the position in the matrix is set to nulldoesnt have cliente i insert b there. Otherwise, i will use the previous function to create a linked list from that position. indice is the position i want to insert in to. Its a value generated by my hash  void insereCliente a, char str, int indice     ClienteSing b    b ClienteSing malloc sizeofstruct cliente    strcpy bgtnome, str    bgtnextNULL     if a[str[0]A][indice]NULL           a[str[0]A][indice]b       printfLivren        else        ultimoRamoa[str[0]A][indice],b         printfColison      codepre  pI can compile this with no problems, it insert well and doesnt give me any segmentation fault... but when i print what i have in the matrix, it gives me garbage... If i print that same cell inside the insert function, it can print with no problems... Can you help me figure out what Im doing wrongp

Negative 54630 pI am trying to implement a C11 wrapper to C API of SQLite, particularly to sqlite3bind functions. I would like it to be something in the shape of this example from my codep  precodesqlt3execltvoidgt     db,     INSERT OR REPLACE INTO window VALUESposition, 3, 4n     INSERT OR REPLACE INTO window VALUESsize, 1, 2n     INSERT OR REPLACE INTO window VALUESmaximized, 5, 0n,     size.x,     size.y,     position.x,     position.y,     staticcastltintgtIsMaximized      codepre  pThe problem here is that codecode are shared between different statements. The codeexeccode function internally prepares subsequent SQL statements one by one. So I cannot determine which parameters should be bound to which statements, because there is no API to get which statement slots the statement contains. I can get the count of slots codencode a max NNN from all NNNs but I am unable to determine whether particular slots from zero to the codencode are actually occupied. It is because there can be single codecode with no number and codesqlite3bindparameternamecode returns codeNULLcode for both the nameless parameter and the lack of parameter. Ideally I would like to have some function that returns a list of indexes of binding points that are used in the given statement or at least some way to discriminate whether given index has associated nameless binding point or no binding point at all.p  pOne solution that I came upon is to bind all parameters, in the order they are passed to the codeexeccode, to all of the statements but I didnt found in the documentation is it legal to bind to nonexistent parameter. Another drawback is that the complexity is codevcode times codescode where codevcode is number of variables to be bound and codescode is number of statements. p  pSo, I came with another workaround to just parse whole string passed to codeexeccode and gather info about binding points codecode, codeNNNcode, codeVVVcode etc.. But, I think it isnt quite trivial task because that special symbol are not special in some contexts like string and quatations. So, what are another contexts in SQL statements, in which special tokens codecode, codeNNNcode, etc. have not meaning of binding pointsp  pstrongSome explanationsstrongp  pTrying to parse SQL is pointless.p  pI do not want to parse SQL, only detect presence and indexes of arguments binding points.p  pDo you really think vs will become large enough that it matters p  pIn common case no, but still I do not know if it is legal to bind parameter to slot that wasnt occurred in statement. And there is a problem with codecode, if it occurs at the beginning of second sentence, it should not has index 1, it should rather have index of the last binding point in previous sentence increased by 1.p  pAnd why do you want to allow multiple statements in a single function call p  pI found ability to do that very handy, especially when you need to execute them in one transaction.p
Negative 54630 pI met an issue of JavaScript constructor, which seems to be some basic knowledge about JavaScript. However, I didnt know it. Could some one help me outp  pI want to create an instance of Circle. Circle constructor looks like followingp  precodevar Circle  functionradius     var radius     An exception is thrown at using member method setRadius.    this.setRadiusradius     this.setRadius  functionvalue        radius  value      var circle  new Circle5 codepre  pAn exception is thrown out saying that this.setRadius is undefined. I dont get whats going wrong here. Does the exception happen because the definition of setRadius is after its invocation If I move setRadiuss definition ahead of its invocation, everything goes fine.p  precodevar Circle  functionradius     var radius    this.setRadius  functionvalue        radius  value         this.setRadiusradius  codepre  pIf setRadius is defined in the prototype, there is no problem at all.p  precodevar Circle  functionradius     this.radius     Its OK to use the method on the prototype chain.    this.setRadiusradius   Circle.prototype.setRadius  functionvalue     this.radius  value  codepre  pAnd Im pretty sure a member method is able to use another member method which is defined after it. The following codes work pretty well.p  precodevar Circle  functionradius     var radius  radius     this.enlarge  functionper        this.setRadiusradiusper         this.setRadius  functionvalue        radius  value      var circle  new Circle5 circle.enlarge1.1 codepre  pSo at creating the instance, why cant I use a member method Javascript is an interpretation language. Hence, when I start new instance, the constructor Function is already interpreted and generated.  Why is its member method still undefinedp

Negative 54630 pAll the iOS drawing information Im finding is related to how to display things in a view. Specifically layering different images, rects, or paths in a view to be seen on screen. Im having trouble finding information as to how I can actually manipulate a UIImage itself.p  pSpecifically, Im looking to open an image file as a UIImage already know how to do this, draw a line in that image, and then save the new UIImage to a file already know how to do this as well. I would assume there would be a fairly simple way to do this, but every solution I find seems to be going into a complex solution which seems like overkill for what I assume would be a minor task. How can I go about doing this simply Or are the much more complex solutions the necessary wayp  pIm guessing something similar to this has been answered before, but my lack of knowledge in the area seems to be making it difficult to properly search for and find these answers.p

Negative 54630 pIm working on a plugin for Gedit 3.4.1, in Python and Gtk3.p  pBefore the problem because of which im here occurred, i had already created the Gtk.Paned through a .ui file xml representation of a Gtk widget hierarchy that Paned was split vertically, and contained two Gtk.Scrollablewindow, each containing a Gtk.Treeview. The Gtk.Paned was the root widget of the .ui representation file that is, it was directly included inside the codeltinterfacegtcode tags.p  pAt this point, everything was OK, and the Paned was, at startup of Gedit, displayed quite symmetrically.p  pThen, I changed the root of the hierarchy, putting a VBox instead Inside of it, I added a Gtk.Label, right above the Gtk.Paned i talked about above.p  pThen, inside the Paned, I changed the widget of its left side I put inside of it a .Box, and inside that Box, the Scrollablewindow that had used to be at the left of the Paned, plus an added new third Scrollablewindow.p  pThats when things went wrong at startup of Gedit, the Paned was now totally disproportionate its left side the one i had changed, containing the new Box and two Scrollablewindows started in a state where its width was extremely reduced compared to the right side which then of course had itself grown to fill the space lost by the left side.p  pI searched for a while a solution. Not being much knowledgeable in Gtk, I hazardously hypothesized that perhaps it was because the left side was now a Box while before it had been a Scrollablewindow.p  pI then logically attempted to put the whole of the left side inside a new fourth  Scrollablewindow. It didnt work, and here i am then.p  pThe original hierarchy when it worked finep  precodePaned   Scrollablewindow 1 left side      Treeview 1   Scrollablewindow 2 right side      Treeview 2 codepre  pThe intermediate hierarchy when it went wrongp  precodeVBox   Label   Paned     Box left side       Scrollablewindow 1           Treeview 1       Scrollablewindow 3          Treeview 3     Scrollablewindow 2 right side        Treeview 2 codepre  pThe current situation after my failed attempt to solve the problemp  precodeVBox   Label   Paned     Scrollablewindow 4 left side       Box         Scrollablewindow 1             Treeview 1         Scrollablewindow 3            Treeview 3     Scrollablewindow 2 right side        Treeview 2 codepre  pI can precise that the ScrollableW 1 and 3 dont fill together in the same time their box i dynamically append and remove one or the other to switch a displaying of two different trees each of which i want to keep their state intact even when they disappear.p  pHoping it might be useful, a hrefhttpsgist.github.combobeel4e8d4e729b0e96b8e62a relnofollowherea is a link to the full .ui file, and, because xml is very verbose, a hrefhttpsgist.github.combobeelf91ad85ab241bcfc77fd relnofollowherea, a cropped version of it where i only kept the strict minimum vaguely YAMLlike, or Pythonlike for that matter.p  pThanks a lot in advance if you find why this is how it is, and how to solve my problem to get back a wellproportionate Paned at startupp

Negative 54630 pI am writing a sleepy device driver for an Operating Systems class.p  pThe way it works is, the user accesses the device via codereadcodecodewritecode. When the user writes to the device like so codewritefd, ampwait, sizecode, the device is put to sleep for the amount of time in seconds of the value of codewaitcode. If the wait time expires then drivers write method returns 0 and the program finishes. But if the user reads from the driver while a process is sleeping on a wait queue, then the drivers write method returns immediately with the number of seconds the sleeping process had left to wait before the timeout would have occurred on its own.p  pAnother catch is that 10 instances of the device are created, and each of the 10 devices must be independent of each other. So a read to device 1 must only wake up sleeping processes on device 1.p  pMuch code has been provided, and I have been charged with the task of mainly writing the codereadcode and codewritecode methods for the driver.p  pThe way I have tried to solve the problem of keeping the devices independent of each other is to include two global static arrays of size 10. One of type codewaitheadqueuetcode, and one of type codeIntcodeBool flags. Both of these arrays are initialized once when I open the device via codeopencode. The problem is that when I call codewakeupinterruptiblecode, nothing happens, and the program terminates upon timeout.

Negative 54630 pIn form, there are set of labels and input fields populated from ngrepeat. I have used one way data binding for label used codecode, so that user, while changing values, can see the old value which is not possible if it was two way bind. Now on save, I am trying to reload the same viewNB one scenario, shows complete list to see the saved data in db using codelocation.pathcode. But that is not updating the label. That is understandable, as location.path does not actually reloadrefreshes the page, until it is different viewroute. I can not use coderoute.reloadcode, as it will always reload the same url. I could have another scenario, where user came to this view for one specific input and on save, I want user to be redirected to scenario one. So, codelocation.pathcode is the only choice, as per my understanding. So, is there any way to update labels, while still using location.pathp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI have view for route codeeditlookupscustomertypescode.p  pscenario 1 You can visit this view and see the entire list of data in the form of codelabelinput fielddelete buttoncode populated by ngrepeat.p  pscenario 2 You can visit the same view for some specific value with route codeeditlookupscustomertypesXdfgcode.p  pIn both cases you can edit the input and save and land on scenario 1 page to see the updated value. The reason for this is, one, to see the updated value and second, if you have selected specific value, deleted it and saved, you will like to go to entire list scenario 1 page. So, a location.path would work, if you were on scenario 2 first. However, it wont have any effect on one way bound label, if you were on scenario 1 first. p  pThe reason, label is one way bound, because you could see the old value, till you saved the changes. Now after save, you want to see the new value and that is the issue. Any workaround would be appreciated.p  pPS I wanted to post the picture, but this site policy forbids me.p

I know I can do it with help of IntelliJEclipse, but Im curious if this can be done in code.p  pAny suggestions how to achieve something like this NOTE I would probably be able to do it in some scripting languages like php where I could use php magic functions to intercept the call.p

Negative 54630 pI am trying to script the restore of a development MongoDB 2.6.9 Replica set from backups located on a CIFS network share.  This is running on a Centos 7 VM instance.

Negative 54630 pIn short, I would like to shut down all MMU and cache operations in a Linux context from inside the Kernel, for debug purposes, just to run some tests.

Negative 54630 pIve got a homework about number sequences. Given array of strongnstrong elements from strong1strong to strongMAXstrong. We can choose any number become strongstartstrong. We can multiply strongstartstrong by 2, or divided it by 2, but if the start is already odd number we cant divided it. The task is we must minimize the total of differences for each number in the array. br brFor example br arr[]2,4,7,32,16 The output is 1, because we can choose 1 as the strongstartstrong. For each element we must make this number greater and closer to the elements. br br We traverse through the array. br For n0 The element is 2. So we multiply strongstartstrong by 2, 1 time strongstart2strong so the difference is 220 br For n1 The element is 4. So we multiply strongstartstrong by 2, 1 time strongstart4strong so the difference is 440 br For n2 The element is 7. So we multiply strongstartstrong by 2, 1 time strongstart8strong so the difference is 871 br For n3 The element is 32. So we multiply strongstartstrong by 2, 2 time strongstart32strong so the difference is 32320 br For n4 The element is 16. So we divided strongstartstrong by 2, 1 time strongstart16strong so the difference is 16160 SO TOTAL DIFFERENCES00101 br br If we choose start3 then it becomes br For n1 The element is 4. So we multiply strongstartstrong by 2, 1 time strongstart6strong so the difference is 642 br For n2 The element is 7. So we multiply strongstartstrong by 2, 1 time strongstart12strong so the difference is 1275 br For n3 The element is 32. So we multiply strongstartstrong by 2, 2 time strongstart48strong so the difference is 483216 br For n4 The element is 16. So we divided strongstartstrong by 2, 1 time strongstart24strong so the difference is 24168 SO TOTAL DIFFERENCES2516831 br br We can see that for strongstart1strong the output is minimum than all numbers by bruteforcing each number from strong1strong to strongMAXstrong. br brTo solve this problem ive got idea. p  blockquote   ol   liFor strongstartstrong we choose all odd number from strong1strong to strongMAXstrong.brli   liThen i bruteforce all the possible strongstartstrong for every elements to get the minimum.li   ol blockquote  pThis is the PASCAL codep  precodeuses math var dataarray[1..1000100] of longint sstring[7] n,i,j,min,ansn,ansb,sublongint  function minimuma,blongintlongint begin if agtb then minimumb else minimuma end  function hitungalongintlongint var x,hit,ca,tot,blongint  begin hit0 tot0 for x1 to n do begin hithitdata[x]  ba  while bltdata[x] do begin bb2 end  tottotb end hitungtothit end  begin readlns readlnn sub1000000 for i 1 to n do readdata[i]  ansbhitung1  j1  while ansbgt0 and jltsub do begin ansnhitung2j1 minminimumansb,ansn ansbmin jj1 end  writelnmin end. codepre  p It works for small strongMAXstrong but the hint of solution said that the solution is using prefixsum, with OstrongMAXstrong2.

Negative 54630 pI have a table called codeleadscode and it has one column codecompanycode. Each company puts up several rows or leads in this table. So the problem is that I use a simple codeSELECT  FROM Leadscode and display the output but some of the companies are pissed off that preference is given to one company over another but I cannot tell them its because they entered the lead first. So instead Im looking for a solution where exactly 1 lead of each company is output and then when it exhausts showing 1 lead of each company the next set of 1lead only appears.p  pSo for example consider this as input tablep  precodeLead ID    Company    1         ABC    2         ABC    3         ABC    4         BCD    5         CDE    6         EFG    7         EFG    8         CDE    9         ABC   10         BCD   11         ABC codepre  pThen I need something likep  precodeLead ID    Company    1         ABC    4         BCD    5         CDE    6         EFG    2         ABC   10         BCD    7         EFG    3         ABC    8         CDE    9         ABC   11         ABC codepre  pSo here exactly 1 lead of each company appears and then the next companys lead appears. When a particular companies leads are exhausted the remaining only appear. This is why in the last 2 results ABC appears twice as no other companies have unlisted leads.p

Negative 54630 pI am developing a website where students get to pick a tutor for extra lessons in a specific subject at a specific hour.p  pstrongThe user states two thingsstrongp  ul lithe subjects they want lessons forli lithe hours at which they are able to receive the lessonsli ul  pThe school has a total of 24 subjects. And an average school week consists of 5 days, each one having 6 classes, hours. Meaning 30 hours in total.p  pstrongSo, 24 subjects and 30 hours to choose from.strongp  pAfter some thinking, I thought that saving the subjects and hours from a student in two separate strings would be the best way to store the information.p  pFor example, in the string subjects. A 1 would represent a subject chosen, and a 0 one that is not chosen. For example strong111100000000000000000000strong is possible, the student only chose the first four subjects. The same case for the string hours, a 1 represents an hours chosen, a 0 one that is not.p  pstrongSo, I got two stringsstrongp  ul lione called subjects with a length of 24 characters, numbers.li lione called hours with a length of 30 characters, numbers.li ul  pNow, of course the students need tutors to choose from. The subjects and hours these tutors teach are stored in a database. Subjects and hours, again, stored in a long string with a length of 24 or 30.p  pstrongSo, I got two tables in my databasestrongp  ul lione called subjects, type varchar with a length of 24 characters, numbers.li lione called hours, type varchar with a length of 30 characters, numbers.li ul  pNow comes the hard part, I cant think of an strongefficientstrong way to match a student with a tutor.p  pIve been working on a solution, but I dont think it would be the best one.p  hr  pFirst, Id store both the input from codesubjectscode and codehourscode from the studentp  precodesubjects  POST[subjects] hours  POST[hours] codepre  pThen Id make sure there arent any weird characters in therep  precodesubjects  stripslashessubjects hours  stripslasheshours subjects  mysqligtrealescapestringsubjects hours  mysqligtrealescapestringhours codepre  pNext thing is a bit more complicated. First, I split the string subjects into an array. Next, I compare this array to an array which has 24 numbers of code1code. Doing so, I know the position of the code1scode located in the string codesubjectscode the student statedp  precodesubjects  strsplitsubjects  fullsubjects  array1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1 subjectsresult  arrayintersectassocsubjects, fullsubjects subjectskeyresult  arraykeyssubjectsresult codepre  pKnowing the position of the code1scode, I can use this number to select the tutors in the database which also have a code1code at the same position. I then push these users in an array, and order them by the ones that match the most code1scodep  precodeusersubjectsmatch  array  foreachsubjectskeyresult as val      nval  23  val     fullval  strrepeat, val . 1 . strrepeat, nval     userdataquery  SELECT firstname FROM members WHERE subjects LIKE fullval     userdataresult  mysqligtqueryuserdataquery or diemysqligterror     userdataarray  userdataresultgtfetchassoc     usersubjects  userdataarray[firstname]     arraypushusersubjectsmatch, usersubjects   ac  arraycountvaluesusersubjectsmatch arsortac ordereduserssubject  arraykeysac printrordereduserssubject codepre  pSo, this would output a bunch tutors, ordered by most matching, to least matching. The next step would be finding the position of the code1scode in the hours stated by the student and selecting which one of the previously selected tutors also have a code1code at the same position in their hours string.p  pstrongButstrong, again, I dont think this is a proper solution. I was wondering if any of you out there can find a better, more efficient one.p  pstrongAlso, Im using AJAX to retrieve the tutors for the students. But providing this script is not necessary.strongp  pPS Sorry for the title, couldnt think of proper one that describes my problem.p

Negative 54630 pIm writing a text editor in Jython. This text editor has a toolbar which is displayed with a codeToolbarViewcode class and handled by a codeToolbarControllercode class. Some actions cant be dealt with by the codeToolbarControllercode on its own, so these are delegated to the codeMainControllercode class.p  pTo avoid repeating code since there are many actions delegated from the codeToolbarControllercode to the MainController, Ive used getattr as suggested in a previous question I asked a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32828305setattrandgetattrwithmethodsherea.

Negative 54630 pThe following code sorts through a dictionary of words in lexicographical order. The problem is that I cannot access the sorted array outside of the for loop. Well I think this is the problem. I have declared the array words in another method and returned it to a private variable within the same class. But after I sort the array and try to print it out, it just prints out the original array. I also want to mention that this sorting method does work as I have tested it in another class where everything was in the main method. So again I believe my problem has to do with returning the new sorted array. I also need to write a few lines of code within the method after the array is sorted and when I tried to return the array, using return words I was unable to write this code.p  precodepublic void insertionSort  int in, out  for out1 outltnElems out     String temp  words[out]                                remove marked item     in  out                                                start shifting at out                      while ingt0 ampamp words[in1].compareTotempgt0           until temp is lexicographically after after the word it is being compared to         words[in]  words[in1]                             shifts word to next position in lexicographical order         in                                                             words[in]  temp  forint i0 i ltwords.length i     System.out.printlnwords[i] codepre
