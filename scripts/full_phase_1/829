Positive 829 pIm trying to get a proof of concept down for a feature I need in my code.  In the real application, I have a Dependency Injection container, and children sometimes need to new up an object, and I need the DI container to return that object.  So Im using an event with a callback that lets the child get that instatiated object.p  pThe problem is, Id like one event, but allow it to return whichever object the caller specifies.  Im not sure how to get that strongly typed object back without casting.  I feel like it should be possible.  If thats confusing enough, heres my examplep  precodeclass Program      public static event EventHandlerltMyEventArgsgt MyEvent     public static void Main              MyEvent  sender, args gt                      Console.WriteLineEvent Fired             args.Callbackhello                    MyEventnull, new MyEventArgsobj gt Console.WriteLineHow do I get obj strongly typed          Console.Read       codepre  pand the event argsp  precodepublic class MyEventArgs      public Actionltobjectgt Callback  get set       public MyEventArgsActionltobjectgt callback              Callback  callback       codepre  pIm stuck, because codeMyEventArgscode cant take a type parameter, as I would really like just one event to handle any return object type.  Is it possible to get a strongly typed object through the callback  p  pAgain, I could send the codeTypecode through as a parameter, and cast it, but I feel like this should be doable.  Its entirely possible that this is impossible, too.p  pThanks for any guidance.p

Positive 829 pI would like to be notified of the button power being pressed on Android. To be clear, I am not looking to override the power button event, but simply being notified of when it has happened. From everything Ive researched so far, there is no such thing in Android. Please let me know if there is, or if there is one planned for Androids near future.p  pUntil now, I have been using screen onoff broadcasts in order to essentially guess that the power button has been pressed. However, since KK Watch API 20 or Lollipop API 21, even this, is no longer accurate. This is because although the broadcast is still named ACTIONSCREENON , they no longer refer to when the screen turned on but instead when the device became interactive, which can be delayed compared to when the screen actually came on. The same is true for ACTIONSCREENOFF, it actually refers to when the device is no longer in interactive mode, not exactly when the screen turned off. p  pThe Display class has some different display states which do actually refer to the screen state STATEOFF, STATEON, STATEDOZE, STATEDOZESUSPEND, or STATEUNKNOWN. You can get the display state with getState but theres no sort of broadcast system to notify that the state has changed, as far as I know.p  pDoes anyone know a way to get more accurately notified of the power button being pressed or the screen changing state If it comes down to it, I wouldnt mind a root solution either.p

Positive 829 pI am triggering a custom event on an element using jQuery and I want the event handler to be able to pass data in the form of an object back to the method that called it. The trigger and the handler are in different scopes and files and cannot be merged or shared in a conventional manner. The trigger method is part of a utility library I am writing and the event handler is part of my frontend view template.p  pstrongI know this code doesnt work,strong but I am writing it to kind of illustrate what I am hoping to try. The pattern is based of of work I have done in .NET.p  precodevar data   foo bar  element.triggersomeevent, data ifdata.foo  bar     alertsomeone changed foo codepre  pAnd the handler...p  precodeelement.bindsomeevent, functionevent, data      ifsomecondition         data.foo  biz  codepre  pThe specific implementation is not terrible important to me as long as I dont have rearrange my code to stick both the codetriggercode and the codebindcode in the same scope.p  pHow do I get return value back from my event handlerp  hr  h2EDITh2  pTo provide a little more context, the triggering method is responsible for obtaining and processing data, and finally rendering it out as markup to the page. Before it does that, it raises the custom event with the same processed codedatacode object so that other components of the app can have the chance to do something with the processed data. p  pIn certain cases, it would be beneficial for the event handlers to modify that set of data, or event signal to the triggering method that the data has already been handled and does not need additional processing or rendering.p  pSomething like below. In this example, the handler might change the way the data is displayed based upon some property value. It may also choose to render the data out a different way e.g. codeinputcode rather than the default rendering in the triggering function e.g. codelabelcode. p  pThis implementation is an example, but the end goals of returning an object from the handler, or modifying the data in the handler such that the triggering method can access it are common to my actual project.p  precodevar data  loaddata element.triggerloadingdata, data ifdata.abortrendertrue      element.appendltlabelgtFooltlabelgt     element.appendltspangt  data.foo  ltspangt  codepre  pAnd the handler...p  precodeelement.bindloadingdata, functionevent, data      ifdata.ispassword  true              data.foo     changed property persisted to triggering method and processed normally          ifdata.type  abc              element.appendltinput value  data.foo  gt         data.abortrender  true   signals to the triggering method that it should not render the data to the page       codepre

Positive 829 pI want to implement a realtime system in which events are triggered at known times.  I could use System.Timers.Timer, and at the end of each event calculate when the next event happens and go into a sleep mode until it occurs some milliseconds later.p  pThe question is, is this the only option I have available or is there a way for events to Trigger after a known time, without starting hundreds of Timersp  pThe reason for the question is, while I expect each event to execute very quickly, its possible that an events start  duration will exceed the next events start, and I dont want that.  Therefore, whatever you suggest has to be independent of the code that executes.p

Unfortunately it seems that when the user pinchs in or pinchs out, Hammer,js triggers also some pan events. p  pI think it happens because , during the pinch gesture, the users fingers make a little pan movement. p  pTheres a way to make Hammer.js ignore the little pan movement during a pinch p  pHonestly, Hammer.js documentation is not clear about this.    p  pHeres my code p  precode                    hammer  new Hammer.Managermyelement                 var singleTap  new Hammer.Tap                     event tap,                                   var doubleTap  new Hammer.Tap                     event doubletap,                     taps 2                                    SWIPE RECOGNIZERS                  var swipeLeft  new Hammer.Swipe                     event swipeleft,                     direction 2                                   var swipeRight  new Hammer.Swipe                     event swiperight,                     direction 4                                   var swipeUp  new Hammer.Swipe                     event swipeup,                     direction 8                                   var swipeDown  new Hammer.Swipe                     event swipedown,                     direction 16                                     PINCH RECOGNIZERS                 var pinch  new Hammer.Pinch                     event pinch,                     pointers 2                                   var pinchIn  new Hammer.Pinch                     event pinchin,                     pointers 2,                                   var pinchOut  new Hammer.Pinch                     event pinchout,                     pointers 2,                                    PRESS RECOGNIZER                 var press  new Hammer.Press                     event press,                     pointers 1,                     threshold 5,                     time 500                                    PAN RECOGNIZER                 var pan  new Hammer.Pan                     event pan,                     pointers 0                                    ROTATE EVENTS RECOGNIZERS                  var rotateStart  new Hammer.Rotate                     event rotatestart,                     pointers 2,                     threshold 0                                   var rotateEnd  new Hammer.Rotate                     event rotateennd,                     pointers 2,                     threshold 0                                   var rotateCancel  new Hammer.Rotate                     event rotatecancel,                     pointers 2,                     threshold 0                                    ADDING RECOGNIZERS TO HAMMER                  hammer.add[doubleTap, singleTap]                  hammer.add[swipeDown, swipeUp, swipeRight, swipeLeft]                  hammer.add[pan]                  hammer.add[pinch]                 hammer.add[press]                  hammer.add[rotateStart, rotateEnd, rotateCancel]                  pinchIn.recognizeWith[pan]                 pinchOut.recognizeWith[pan]                 pan.requireFailure[pinchIn, pinchOut]                   BEHAVIOUR ON TAP                 doubleTap.recognizeWithsingleTap                   DOUBLETRIPLE TAP RECOGNIZERS EXCLUSION                 singleTap.requireFailure[doubleTap]                  Binding Hammers events with hammerHandler                 hammer.ontap doubletap press rotatestart rotateend rotatecancel swipeleft swiperight swipeup swipedown pan pinch, function event                      hammerHandlerevent                  codepre

Positive 829 pIm writing an application that shows notifications trough baloontips over notifyicon. There are two kinds of notifications I want to display  normal baloontip and clickable baloontip.

I guess I could do some global variable that holds current codeurlcode and avoid assigning codenewcode everytime codecode would work then, but it looks like cheap workaround. Is there any correct way to do it p
Positive 829 pIm currently working on a game in node using socket.io and drawing onto canvas. Im noticing that when I click during the game, character movement slows to a crawl.

Positive 829 pNote All event pubsub in my question is via jQuerys ontriggerp  pI have a module called Header in my application that triggers a custom event Headerinit at some point of time. This event will be triggered exactly once.p  pMany other modules in the application subscribe to this event. I would like the event handlers in these modules to execute if the Headerinit event triggered before the handlers were attached. Else the handlers execute as expected once Headerinit is fired.p  pI hope I am clear in what I require  the functionality is much like the standard ready event of jQuery  handlers execute as soon as they are attached if DOM is ready, else they execute once DOM is ready.p  pTo reiterate, Headerinit is triggered exactly once.p  pHow can I do this I dot want any variables floating around the application for this. Looking for a clean solution  preferably, just the way ready event works. I checked jQuery site for any event hooks provided by jQuery for this, but everything in centered on browser events like click etc. and none for custom ones.p  pAppreciate any kind of pointers.p  hr  pEdit To state clearly the requirement...p  pTime x  Some module subscribing to the Headerinit event has code below and gets executed now...p  p document .on Headerinit, function     the handler      ... p  pTime x  1  Suppose the Header module triggered the event now i.e. a later point of timep  p document .trigger Headerinit p  pMy requirement is the handler should still be executed.p

Positive 829 pcodempmeventcode is like codempmworkercode except that codempmeventcode manages all nonSSL KeepAlive connections with a separate, dedicated thread rather than having each thread manage each individual connection.  By giving and then keeping a dedicated thread for each KeepAlive connection, codempmworkercode leaves that thread and its resources bound to that connection regardless of whether or not a request is being processed. codempmeventcode on the other hand, can lower system resource use in high concurrency environments by allowing the thread and its resources to be recycled back to the system once requests are complete.p  pIt seems to me that in high concurrency, nonSSL environments where KeepAlive has long timeouts, codempmeventcode has the potential to make for a system that can handle a higher workload with equivalent resources than a system with the same resorces using codempmworkercode. strongemMore importantly, it seems to me that in terms of resource use and features, codempmeventcode is at least as good as codempmworkercode, if not better, in all circumstances.emstrongp  pDespite my understanding that codempmeventcode is always at least as good and possibly better, my favorite Linux distributions default to using codempmworkercode when installing Apache 2.4 from the repositories.

Positive 829 pSomething strange happens in Chrome for desktop and android seems to be webkit relatedp  ul liIf you add a codewebkitTransitionEndcode event listener to an element it fires correctly when a CSS animation ends.li liIf you then add another listener to the same element but listening to the codetransitionendcode event it will be the only one triggered on CSS animation end.

Im guessing at some point they tried fixing it by firing only the unprefixed event.p  pThe problem Im seeing is that once I create an event listener for codetransitionendcode it breaks other functionality already listening for codewebkitTransitionEndcode. The target element just stops emitting the prefixed event. Yes, ideally all handlers should be migrated to codetransitionendcode but in the meantime this browser behavior does not seem correct.p  pIs this the expected behavior Has anyone else come across thisp  pThank youp

Negative 829 pA startstepstop code is a data compression technique that is used to compress number that are relatively small.p  pThe code works as follows It has three parameters, start, step and stop. Start determines the amount of bits used to compute the first few numbers. Step determines how many bits to  add to the encoding when we run out and stop determines the maximum amount of bits used to encode a number.p  pSo the length of an encoding is given by l  start  step  i.p  pThe i value of a particular code is encoded using unary. That is, a number of 1 bits followed by a terminating 0 bit. If we have reached stop then we can drop the terminating 0 bit. If i is zero we only write out the 0 bit.p  pSo a 1, 2, 5 startstepstop code would work as followsp  pValue 0, encoded as 0 0br Value 1, encoded as 0 1br Value 2, encoded as 10 000br Value 9, encoded as 10 111br Value 10, encoded as 11 00000br Value 41, encoded as 11 11111brp  pSo, given a file containing several numbers, how can we compute the optimal startstepstop codes for that file The optimal parameters are defined as those that will result in the greatest compression ratio.p

At worst, crashes the software.p  pQ4 Has anyone tried to do anything about this problembr A4 Sure, though I havent seen any for C as opposed to C or other, for examplep  pa hrefhttpwww.ddj.comcpp184401999pgno1 relnofollowhttpwww.ddj.comcpp184401999pgno1a a hrefhttpmi.eng.cam.ac.uker258cvdtaghtmlgroup5F5Fprintf.html relnofollowhttpmi.eng.cam.ac.uker258cvdtaghtmlgroupprintf.htmlap  pWhats missing for me in these offerings and others, besides the fact that right now Im looking at a product written in C and need to solve the problem for C, is that they are afterthefact solutions. They can avoid crashes, and can provide warning explanations of what went wrong, and emthatem something went wrong, but they certainly cant guess what the programmers intention was see esp. QampA 2 above.p  pQ5 Why is using printf so errorpronebr A5 Because writing a printf call requires the programmer to mix types and numbers of variables, format specifiers, free text string constants, and punctuation  all of which look very similar to each other  on one line together.p

Negative 829 pI have a DIV container with several inner DIVs layed out by floating them all left. The inner DIVs may change width on certain events, and the containing DIV adjusts accordingly. I use floatleft in the container to keep it shrunk to the width of the inner divs. I use floatleft in the inner divs so the layout is clean even when their contents change.p  pThe catch is that I want the DIV container width and height to remain constant, UNLESS a particular event causes a change to the inner widths. Conceptually I want to use float on the inners for the layout benefit, but then I want to fix them so they dont float around. So if the container is 700px wide, I want it to remain so even if the user narrows the browser window. Id like the container, and its internal DIVs to just be clipped by the browser window.p  pI sense this can all be done nicely in CSS, I just cant quite figure out how. Im not averse to adding another container if necessary...p  pSince the only desired layout changes are eventbased, I am also willing to use a bit of JS. But is this necessary And Im still not sure I know what to modify container dimensions inner floatiness otherp  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 TransitionalEN   httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1transitional.dtdgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt ltstyle typetextcssgt  canvas    overflowauto    for clearing floats    container    floatleft    so container shrinks around contained divs    borderthin solid blue   .inner    floatleft    so inner elems line up nicely wo saying fixed coords    paddingtop8px   paddingbottom4px   paddingleft80px   paddingright80px   inner1    backgroundcolorffdddd   inner2    backgroundcolorddffdd   inner3    backgroundcolorddddff   ltstylegt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdiv idcanvasgt ltdiv idcontainergt ltdiv idinner1 classinnergt inner 1 ltdivgt ltdiv idinner2 classinnergt inner 2 ltdivgt ltdiv idinner3 classinnergt inner 3 ltdivgt ltdivgt ltdivgt cleared element ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre

Negative 829 pIn perl, I often need to run a child process, send some input to it, and then read its output. There are a number of modules to do this, but they all seem to require you to pass in preexisting variables, which are then modified by the function to contain filehandles. Here is an example from the Synopsis of a hrefhttpsearch.cpan.orgjesseperl5.12.1extIPCOpen3libIPCOpen3.pm relnofollowIPCOpen3ap  precodemy wtr, rdr, err use Symbol gensym err  gensym pid  open3wtr, rdr, err,                 some cmd and args, optarg, ... codepre  pThis pattern gets kind of annoying when I have to do it over and over, especially because it involves a bunch of positional parameters that I need to either remember or look up. Is there any module out there that provides a function lets call it codemyopen3code that  works like the followingp  precodemy wtr, rdr, err  myopen3some cmd and args, optarg, ... codepre  pOr it could return a hash or hashref of the relevant handlesp  precodemy process  myopen3some cmd and args, optarg, ... processgtSTDINgtprintSome input my output  processgtSTDOUTgtreadline codepre  pThe advantages of such a function are that codemyopen3code is emcalledem in exactly the same way as the builtin codesystemcode though hopefully without some quirks, and in the case of returning a hash or hashref, positional parameters and return values are avoided. Also, if the module author later decided to also return the pid and other information about the process, that could be done while maintaining backwardscompatibility.p  pI actually implemented this myself with a simple OO interface, but I would rather not rely on my own custom module if a CPAN module exists to do the same thing.p  pThe closest Ive found so far is a hrefhttpsearch.cpan.orgrkrimenIPCRunSessionSimple0.002libIPCRunSessionSimple.pm relnofollowIPCRunSessionSimplea, which returns an object with codereadercode and codewritercode methods.

Same as above, the adaptor is recognised by the system and the scanner gets reset on insertion of the PCMCIA card, but vuescan does not see the scanner.p  pBack to Ubuntu, I tried the command codeecho scsi addsingledevice 0 0  0 gt procscsiscsicode with code0code and code2code for codecode having set the scsi device number on the scanner to 0 or 2 to no avail. with 2 it said the parameter was incorrect, with 0 it accepted but did not seem to do anything with it. codeprocscsiscsicode is always size 0. I have tried those commands as root, and tried starting codevuescancode both under my regular user and as coderootcode. In every try so far with the 4000t and Adaptec SlimSCSI 1450B PCMCIASCSI adaptor codevuescancode does not see any scanner.p  pI would appreciate any lead that would help me debug or fix this issue.br 20110103 I posted the same question on AskUbuntu with no luck to date, so if any of you guys out here have an inkling how to help, please shout.p

Negative 829 pwhat is the difference between linking against gccs and gcc by means of LDFLAGS Is gccs a static library and gcc shared libraryp  pBecause I was looking for a solution where it is mentioned to link against gcc whereas only gccs works in my case. I wish to know the real difference.p  pltlt hidden symbol namehere in somelibrarypath.afilename.o is referenced by DSOp  pIn this case, the problem is usually solved by adding either l gcc or codegcc printlibgccfilenamecode to the linking flags LDFLAGS. However, unlike my other regular platforms i386, amd64, sparc64 here it wasnt enough. After a lot of headbanging to be fair, it also comes from the music I realized that this flag is necessary both when linking the libc emandem  the final executable file.  link a hrefhttppeople.defora.orgkhorben200903.htmlhttppeople.defora.orgkhorben200903.htmlap

Negative 829 pI have an octagon which I need to rotate and translate to 10,000 different locationsangle. The angle and coordinates changes dynamically. p  ol lipIf I use glRotate and glTranslate in immediate mode, it would be too slow due to all the going back and forth between clientserver.pli lipIf I use glRotate and glTranslate on a Display List, it will be fast, but I am avoiding Display List because it is deprecated. pli lipIf I use VBO, I have to prerotate and and pretranslate the octagon on the CPU prior to uploading it to server memory. This works, but takes lots of CPU time. pli ol  pSo I am wondering...is there anyway to translaterotate  with vertices stored in VBO , without resorting to CPU based computation.  Is there a VBO equivalent for executing rotatetranslate values stored in server memory I would really love the GPU to do all the calculations and free my CPU from all the trig functions.p

Negative 829 pI know there is a lot of information here... but there may be other people with problems like this, and I think it would be a great help to discuss this, or at least get some decent inputsuggestions brewing.p  pAlright, let me start out by giving an overview of our environment.p  pWe have a multimodule maven project with about 11 JARs.  Dependent on those internal JARs are 9 WAR files, of which 8 are placed in an EAR file.  The remaining WAR file is deployed on its own as a separate application.  When the 8 WAR files are built that reside in the EAR, they are built as skinny WAR files, so the resultant EAR file is at a minimal size with all dependencies in the APPINFlib section.  All of this works with no issues.  We currently deploy to a strongremotestrong WebLogic 10.3 server that has a lot of memory and CPU, so the load is not on our individual machines.  Were also publishing nightly snapshots using a continuous integration build server.p  pArtifacts that were deployingbr EAR file containing 8 WAR files, 11 internal JARs, and third party libs 70MBbr Other WAR file 110MBp  pSome of our software engineers would like to work from home, over a VPN connection, and have incrementalhot deployment options.  Otherwise, because of how we deploy with web logicmaven, they are forced to build an entire EAR file or the 110MB WAR file and upload them over VPN.  This is not fun, and its not fast.  I have been reading on strongJRebelstrong, and was wondering if anyone else uses JRebel with a multimodule maven project doing remote deployments, and how to do it efficiently.p  pFrom some of my reading, it is recommended to upload the changes to the server and have the rebel.xml configurations reading those directories for that particular deployment which... well, brings us to the issue at hand.  How do I tell Maven to dump changed resourcesnewly compiled class files to some other directory so that I can upload them to the server and to the appropriate folders our server hosts something like 10 WebLogic instances running on various ports, one instance per developer.  Or just have the developers share their workspace folder with the network, and configure rebel.xml files in a JAR, for example point to the appropriate COMPUTERNAMEworkspacejarProjectNametargetclasses folder.  The problem I foresee with that is, every time they start WebLogic, its going to fish all the .class and configuration files and JSP files across the network, because the rebel.xml file wins first, and that will be terrible over VPN.  AFTER the deploy is up though, then hot deployment should work as usual.  I just dont want the unnecessary overhead of transferring all the classes over the network for the first boot, and not only that, sometimes developers are at the office, turn off their computer, and then go home.  What happens to JRebelWebLogic thenp  pIt seems like a much better idea to only see what files have changed in the various maven projects, and FTP them to the proper location on the server so that JRebel can do its thing, completely server side.  Does anyone have a good way to do this  Or maybe someone has a solution that does not involve JRebel at all.  Lets talk.p

Negative 829 pI browsed around for a few answers but had no luck. Actually, it is kinda complicated to explain what Im trying to do with words, so lets see some snipetsp  pI have 4 attributesp  precodeprivate int pageCount type 1 private int[] monoColorCount type 2 private float cost  type 3 private int type codepre  pBut at any time, an object will have value to only one of these. They are fed by a method that returns a string parsed from a XML and depending on the type I will know which one has value. My first attempt was a switchcase, a solution that works but is far from efficientp  precodeswitchtype         case 1 pageCount  Integer.parseIntQuotasBalance.getUserQuotauser, domain break         case 2 StringTokenizer st  new StringTokenizerQuotasBalance.getUserQuotauser, domain,                  monoColorCount  new int[]Integer.parseIntst.nextToken, Integer.parseIntst.nextToken break         case 3 cost  Float.parseFloatQuotasBalance.getUserQuotauser, domain      codepre  pMaybe I shouldve mentioned before Im strung to Java 1.4, therefore the StringTokenizer. In this case, Id have to use a switchcase on type every time I needed this value from an external classp  precodeswitchmyQuotaInstance.getType         case 1 Do something with pageCount         case 2 Do something with monoColorCount         case 3 Do something with cost      codepre  pNeedless to say, thats ridiculous. I also tried polymorphism and reflection, but since I fail to grasp completely the concept of reflection yet, that was another dead end. I tried creating a different class to encapsulate only those three attributes which only accounted for delegating the inevitable. Well, I think I made myself clear. Now Im open to suggestions on how to tackle this problem.p

Negative 829 pI have a dataset of 2D points 500k of them on which Id like to perform some kind of quadrat count analysis. The basics of quadrat count is to split your 2D space into a regular grid each cell has size codeSxScode and count the number of points in each cell.p  pFor some reason, Id like to do a slight variation of that  instead of using a regular grid, I want to build the grid such that each cell contains strongat moststrong codeKcode points.p  pWhat I did is the following I start with the whole space, and divide it in 4 cells by cutting each dimension in half. Then, I count the number of points in each cell. For those that contain more than codeKcode points, I divide them again, etc., until Im done.p  pI tried both recursive and iterative implementations of this simple algorithm, but none performed well when applied to the whole dataset. The main bottleneck is the counting part, obviously, so I was wondering what kind of datastructure would allow me to do this efficiently p  pFor now, Im just using conditional indexing in Python  codepoints  points[points[,1] gt x1 and points[,1] lt x2 and points[,2] gt y1 and points[,2] lt y2,]codep  pAlso, do you have maybe another idea on how I could build my grid p  pEDIT In other words, what kind of data structure could I use to quickly count and retrieve the points that fall within a given rectangle codex1, y1, x2, y2codep
Negative 829 pI have a Conrec nightmare.  I am trying to implement contour lines in ActionScript using Conrec.  I have looked at both the java and javascript implementation and am still stuck.  These are found here a hrefhttppaulbourke.netpapersconrec relnofollowhttppaulbourke.netpapersconrecap  pConrec will take grid data and assemble continuous contour lines.  The problem is that it does not necessarily draw those lines in a continuous fashion.  For example, it will draw AB and then CB and then CD instead of A, B, C, D, etc.p  pThe javascript implementation seems to be accounting for this and serializing the instructions into an array of draw points.  Which is what I too want to accomplish in the end.  That is it takes the instructions from the core Conrec logic eg AB, CB, CD, etc and organizes it into an A, B, C, D series.  I emthinkem it will also return the series as a multidimensional array to accommodate broken lines eg [[A, B, C, D], [E, F, G]].  This last functionality is what I need to do in Actionscript.p  pThis last part is where I am stuck.  Ignore Conrec for now I have given up on finding an Actionscript implementation, how can I organize these instructions into a collection of serial points  When Conrec gives me draw point from XY how can I first check if X or Y are already in a series and append either X or Y whichever is not in the series into the series  AND if neither are in the series, start a NEW series with X, Y as the starting set.  Then check subsequent instructions against all existing series and connect series if they now start and stop on the same point  Also, I need to be able to allow for a series to close itself eg A, B, C, A  a loop is that even possible.p  pI hope this makes sense.  Im not sure if there is a technical term for what I want to do beyond concatenation.  I also hope someone out there has done this with Conrec and can give me some pointers.p  pIn the meantime, I am going to continue to plug away at this and see if I can come up with something but I am not confident in my abilities.  I would really be thankful for some veteran or professional advice.p  pPS If you know another way to draw contour lines from grid data, I am open to alternatives.  But I have to be able to implement it in Actionscript.p

Negative 829 pI have two POCO types, A and B. I have a repository for each, RepcodeltAcode and RepcodeltBcode, both of which implement IRepcodeltAcode and IRepcodeltBcode served up by an IoC container AutoFac in this case.p  pThere are several kinds of repositories  loadondemand from a DB or whatever, lazyloaded inmemory collections, cached webservice results, etc. Callers cant tell the difference. Both RepcodeltAcode and RepcodeltBcode happen to be inmemory collections as As and Bs dont change very much and live a long time.p  pOne of the properties of B is an A. What I do now is, when a B is asked for its A, B gets IRepcodeltAcode to find its A and returns it. It does this every time  every request for Bs A involves IRepcodeltAcode.Find. The upside is Bs never hold onto As and each request takes into account whatever the state of Rep happens to be. The downside is a lot of IoCIRepcodeltAcode churn.p  pI am thinking of using the LazycodeltTcode pattern here so that a B asks IRepcodeltAcode once and holds onto what it got. But what happens if an A is deleted from its repositoryp  pI am looking for a clean way for RepcodeltAcode to notify whoever is interested when it has changed. In my example, a certain Bs A may be deleted, so I would like RepcodeltAcode to raise an event when something is deleted, or added, etc. RepcodeltBcode might subscribe to this event to clean up any Bs that refer to As that are now gone, etc. How to wire it upp  pIdeally nothing changes when instantiating a RepcodeltAcode. It should have no idea who listens, and As might be manipulated all day long without ever firing up a Rep.p  pBut when RepcodeltBcode is born it needs a way to subscribe to RepcodeltAcodes event. There might not be a RepcodeltAcode alive yet, but surely there will be once a B is asked for its A, so it seems ok to fire up a RepcodeltAcode.p  pIn essense, when RepcodeltBcode is instantiated, it want it to register itself with RepcodeltAcode for the event notification. I dont want to pollute the IRepcodeltTcode interface becaue this shouldnt matter to anyone outside the Repository layer. And other types of repositories might not have to worry about this at all.p  pDoes this make any sensep
Negative 829 pI need some advice, because I am new to cp  pFor my wind turbine analysis program, I divided it up into various objects that handle certain tasks.p  pOne object handles file inputoutput, and in my troublesome case i read from a file to get data, and this data is filled into an array of objects called blade, which each holds arrays of things like stresses and coordinates all related to the each blade.p  pAnother task is post processing, and I want this postpro object to be able manipulate the blades data. p  pSo, my main instantiates a postpro object, which starts the inputoutput object and tells it to read the data into Blade object array. So far so good, now I want to get the filled blade object array back into postpro so i can do some stuff with it.p  pThis leads to my question, but I will first ask question 0p  p0 does this way of working with objects sounds correctp  pAnd the actual questionp  p1 Returning a pointer of the object array seems like the way to go, and for some reason i got it into my head that a sharedptr is the way to go.

Negative 829 pI just noticed while building a delphi 2010 application that the scrollbar is always the same size when it shows up. The scroller in the middle of the bar is always the same size no matter how much there actually is to scroll. In contrast, most modern applications use scrollbars where the size of the scroller is proportional to the amount available to scroll, so that by looking it is clear how much there is to scroll through. Is there a way to change the scroll properties on my delphi controls, or would that require custom controlsp  pedit The component in this particular instance was a TDBGrid, which scrolled horizontally. I didnt realize that windows was drawing these scrollbars. Perhaps Warren is correct and the question is unanswerable. Proportional scrollbars may not be ubiquitous on windows but I have yet to find a program on my windows machine that doesnt use them. Even the delphi 2010 IDE uses them.p

Negative 829 pIm having some real difficulties porting a really old Visual Studio 97 C project to Visual Studio 2010.  Let me begin by first giving a little background on the errors I was getting immediately prior to this new LNK1224 error because they may be related, but Im not sure.p  pPrior to my new error I was receiving this errorp  precodeerror LNK2005 void cdecl operator deletevoid  3YAXPAXZ already defined in LIBCMT.libdelete.obj  nafxcw.libafxmem.obj codepre  pThrough some digging I found that the reason for this error was because both the MFC and CRT libraries contain definitions for new and delete so they were colliding.  Microsoft provides 2 solutions for this detailed in a hrefhttpsupport.microsoft.comkbq148652 relnofollowhttpsupport.microsoft.comkbq148652a .  One of them was to make sure that in all your files you always include the MFC headers afx stuff first.  Well there are about 100 files in this project and I just got tired of trying to find the files that were including resources in the wrong order.  So I went with the other solution which is basically forcing libraries to load in a particular order.  Basically you have to tell the compiler to ignore a particular library so that you can load it explicitly your self in the order that you choose.  In my case, it was nafxcw.lib.p  pSo under Project Properties  Linker  Input,  I explicitly ignored nafxcw.lib and then explicitly included it at the front of the list.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnCGrk.jpg altProperties windowp  pSo after doing this, my LNK2005 errors went away.  But they were replaced with one single link error. p  precodeerror LNK1224 invalid image base 0x287600000 codepre  pI dont know if I fixed my previous link errors correctly and this new link error is in fact the next thing I have to deal with, or I simply created a more critical link error that is basically stopping the linking process before it gets to my original LNK2005 errors.  In either case, there isnt much information I could find on this error.  Microsoft doesnt say much in this link about it a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary3ya3f8wz28vvs.8029.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrary3ya3f8wz28vvs.8029.aspxap  blockquote   pYou specified an invalid base address for the image.

Negative 829 pIve been trying to search around web for guideshelp for accessing byte code classes via interface that the byte code class is casted to in ASM. Ive seen this done on RuneScape bot called powerbot RSBot which source I also got from a hrefhttpsgithub.compowerbotRSBot relnofollowhttpsgithub.compowerbotRSBota but i cannot understand how is it done as I get class cast exception when casting a class to interface which contains the skeleton of every method.. I know it must be stupid to think like you could just cast a class to interface.. I know there must be some preparements or so but in ASM bookebook httpdownload.forge.objectweb.orgasmasmguide.pdf theres nothing about it as far as ive readed. I am really interested in this, not to make a new RS bot but to learn this cool library to replace BCEL in my needs. Ill give you a quick example to understand this problem betterp  pHere i have class called helloSOp  precodepublic class helloSO       public void doSomething         System.out.printlnI did something D        codepre  pand here i have interface called helloSO alsop  precodepublic interface helloSO       public void doSomething   codepre  pi would like to be able to cast the .class i read and define to class with ASM to that interface to be able to call the methods from that instance with their names.. I hope i explained this well enought. If you want you can check the RSBot to see better what i mean.  So what i am asking is what preparations I have to do and where can i learn about them I am not asking you to create me class adapter or anything just advice and help  Thanks in advancep

Here we gop  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netnicktheandroidPCgFK1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netnicktheandroidPCgFK1ap  pThis JSfiddle allows you to grab the page in the scrollbox and fling it up or down, like a touchscreen phone. Right now, if you grab the pagein the scrollbox area and move your mouse upcausing the page to scroll down, then release the mouse button, the velocity will kick in and it will jump the page a little. Its there for when you actually grab the page and flick it up or down to scroll the page, it makes it come to a nice slow and steady stop. If the person doesnt flick, but instead just drags the page and then holds the mouse steady and releases the mouse button, it jumps, like I stated above. Im trying to get rid of that jump when the person grabs and drags the page, then while the mouse is still, releases the mouse button. p  pI thought that by updating the codestartPositioncode every 100ms or so, that it would eliminate that jump but still keep the velocity slow down from flicking the page up or down. Im pretty close to being done with this, but theres still the problem that i just stated. Someone else helped me out with adding the velocity, and in the script theres a variable called codevelocityCheckWaitcode that I think is doing the opposite of what I wanted it to do.p  pSorry for any confusion, and thank you to anyone who could dedicate any time to helping me out.p

Negative 829 pIve been trying to implement graphics in a GUI application Ive made in Netbeans.  Ive done the layout buttons, textboxes, etc. using the GUI editor and it all works fine so far.  Basically what I want to do is generate some graphics lines and such in the bottom half of my JFrame and leave the checkboxes, buttons, and such in the top half of my JFrame.  p  pFrom the examples Ive seen, the general approach is to create a class which extends JPanel and contains graphics code to create lines and other various shapes.  Ive been able to implement this independent of the GUI editor, but the application consists solely of the JPanel which occupies the entire JFrame.  Different approaches Ive used for doing this in the GUI editor have either generated the graphics but blocked out everything else in my JFrame even for a tiny line or not done anything at all.p  pIdeally Id want to be able to place a JPanel of arbitrary size in an arbitrary location on my JFrame and create graphics that are contained within the panel.  Id also want the coordinates of the graphics I create to be referenced to the JPanel rather than the JFrame so coordinate 0,0 is the top left of my JPanel regardless of where I decide to place it.  p  pIs there a straightforward means of doing thisp  pexample code would be greatly appreciatedp
Negative 829 pIs there a native .NET way to look up numbers in various countingordering systems, languages and cultures. For example, I have the numbers 1, 2, and 3. If I want these in Arabic, I can get them with codeNumberInfocode, e.g.p  precodePublic Sub PrintNumbers     Dim currentCI As CultureInfo  New CultureInfoarLB     Dim nfi As NumberFormatInfo  currentCI.NumberFormat     Dim nativeDigitList As String  nfi.NativeDigits     For i  1 To 3         System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLineString.Format0 1, i, nativeDigitListi     Next End Sub codepre  pWhich prints 1 , 2 , 3 p  pThis is a good start at what Im looking for, but Im looking for a much more complete system of producing native digits and other counters for other counting systems in languagescultures.p  pNative digits, as in .NET using the same code for Chinese zhCN produces 1 1, 2 2, 3 3. But Im looking for  1 , 2 , 3 . Or even Chinese Financial 1 , 2 , 3 . Note emChinese samples in Simplifiedem.p  pIn English, we also use Roman numerals 1 I, 2 II, 3 III.p  pThere are nonnumeric counting systems as well, such as 1 A, 2 B, 3 C in English,  in Arabic or the Abjad system in Arabic  .p  pIm sure there are many other ways to count across various languages, scripts and cultures. The codeNativeDigitscode array doesnt provide for counting above 9 and doesnt offer other culturalscript counting systems.p  pSo the question is do you know of any way to achieve this in .NET that I may have not been able to find or has work on an opensource project been done that would allow me to specify a culture like faIR, a number like 49 and a counting system supported by that culturep  pSo if it was enUS, 27 and abcsystem, it would give me aa.p

Negative 829 pIm designing a form layout to be uesd on many pages within an online system. A devout user of tables for this purpose for many years, Im getting pretty used to using CSS  labels for this now.p  pOne thing Ive yet to be able to master is the way different browsers pad amp position the label relative to the input field.

He was right  the reset.css file I had from a hrefhttphtml5reset.orghttphtml5reset.orga didnt have padding on the input element. However, even after applying the changes, there is still a variation in the alignment of the base of the text in the label compared to that in the input. Now Firefox is deadlevel, and for IE amp Chrome the label text is 1px higher.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comf6eGy.jpg altenter image description herep  pIf I remove the link to reset.css, things change again Chrome becomes deadlevel, IE puts the label 1px higher than the input text, Firefox 1px lower than the input text. See belowp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9is1q.jpg altenter image description herep  pI should point out that this is a very basic layout, simply to try and diagnose the problem. Ill be making it look all better later. But first I need to know how to make all my text line up across all browsers with one CSS solution.p

Negative 829 pIve had great success with rendering PDFS with this library. Im currently rendering PDFs which contain 4 pages of images at a size of 2056x2056, scaled down to fit on the page. This is to provide better resolution from the 72dpi base images. p  pThese pdfs take about 1.5 minutes to render though.

Negative 829 pI am using Jackson JSON parser 1.9.5 in Hadoop Java MR program 0.20.205.

It seems that the codeJsonIgnorePropertiesignoreUnknown  truecode annotation is somehow not working property when running in MapReduce and the fields that I want dont get deserialized everything after id is null.  If I add all the fields and getters and setter to to my codeTransactioncode object and remove codeJsonIgnorePropertiescode, then everything works fine.

Negative 829 pI have an Activity, where is a MapView on part of screen. Here I always center location to given point. Then I have another activity, where is MapView on whole screen and I center to users location. When I came back from whole screen MapView activity to activity with MapView on part of a screen, I call setCenter on MapView again. But now MapView isnt centered on right location but few meters elsewhere. When I use animateTo, everything works as expected. Is it any setCenter bug or how should I explain this strange behaviour to myselfp

Negative 829 pIs it possible to use or adapt jQuerys .select to set a selection range on the entire contents of a divp  pI have a div which has a series of labels, inputs, select objects and a couple of other UI elements. I have found code on a separate StackOverflow post with some code hosted on jsFiddle a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netKcX6A570 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netKcX6A570ap  pCan this be adapted to select the value of inputs also Or how would you suggest I go about thisp  pThanks, Conorp  hr  pEdit More infop  pI know how to get the value of inputs using jQuery, that is easy, I also know how to select he values of independent elements using .select.p  pIn my div I have a series of different element types including inputs, labels, selects, etc. I need an overall selection of all elements. The jsFiddle link I added earlier shows how to set the range of a div and select the text of elements like p tags etc. What I need is to set the range of the divs contents and when I hit ctrlc or cmdc it copies the values of the inputs as well as the labels.p  pSo to summarise, using .val and .select wont work for this I dont think. I need to combine the above in some way but not sure exactly how this will be accomplished. Any ideasp

Negative 829 pWhen we design a class in Delphi, typically we have private fields members, private setter and getter methods and a public property.

Negative 829 pIm using PHP from two different Web sites. Those sites call PayPals Name Value Paid NVP API to create recurring payment profiles. p  pA week ago, about 40 of any attempts to create recurring payment profiles for Visa and MasterCard cards started failing. That wasnt too big a deal since, if you just resubmitted the exact same card details immediately, it would usually go through. On the evening of June 1, 2012, however, ALL of my ViasMCAmex profile creations started failing.p  pTo determine if it was something in my servers, I logged onto the PayPal Web site to use its function to create profiles. That function failed with the same errors. PayPal returns a 10764 error for VisaMC and a 10752 error for Amex. I then used PayPals Virtual Terminal to create direct onetime payments using the same cards. All of those payments were successful. So, the cards are good.p  pIf the consumer uses a Discover Card or a PayPal ID to create a recurring payment profile, that appears to still work. But without direct Visa, MC andor Amex support, my entire business. p  pIve submitted tickets and called my PayPal account team. Their vagueness in answering my questions has been terrifying. They acknowledged the problem, but wont tell me definitely if anyone else is have the same problem. If its just me, then I fear my business is dead since PayPal will surely fix, or never fix, the problem on their own timetable. p  pIs anyone else having the same problem Does anyone know a work around Can anyone suggest how I could escalate this within PayPalp

I want to be able to use Bs which is actually always either D or F virtual functions to modify the values of G...  However, A and B do not know of any of their child classes, and thus cannot be declared using them.  This means that the virtual function arguments must always be a pointer to an A.  However, D wants to have its input always be a C, and F wants its input to be an E.  While this might not have been an issue if G was inheriting from only one parent, our current G is inheriting from 2 parents  I do not know how the codethiscode pointers actually work in the underlying context of situations like this... however, I do not feel like this is going to be a possible situation.p  pWould anyone be willing to shed some light on the mechanisms of casting pointers to parentchild classes, and if there would be any way this could be pulled offp

Negative 829 pIll try to keep this as short as possible.. I am making an app for iPhone that needs to be able to store some images from the web. The URL for the imagesamong other data are stored in one table at a MySQLserver. From there, I have parsed the table with JSON, and successfully serialized this to show in a UITableView in the app. Each cell now shows the image from the imageurlfield in the table, and the title of the image as text, from the titlefield in the table, both from MySQLjson.phpNSArrayjsonobjectAtIndex etc.p  pAt this point, every time the App launches, it gets all the information from the url with JSON.php every time, and I think it downloads the image every time aswell. I feel that this is way more work than necessary, but, as the database is going to update itself irregulary based on where it gets its data, its not good enough to just download the information once.p  pQuestion 1 I need a solution where the app asks the .php if it has the same exact data as the JSON shows. The most logical way I can think of is to add a field for date in the .php, showing which date the data was last updated, and if the app has data from the same date, nothing happens, but if the phpside date is newer than the appside date, then it must be able to delete all stored data, and replace with the new JSONdata.p  pQuestion 2 The JSONdata is an NSArray in the iPhone, and the field for Image is just the url to the image www.example.comimage.png, and not the actual image. How can I download these images and save them on the iPhone until a new version of the data is available through JSONp  pBonus question The method I am using now is making the UITableView lagging when I scroll. I am no pro, but I have read several places that this can be caused by leaking memory, and I have not completely understood what this means. I also read that it can be because I maybe instantiate objects for every cell, instead of once and reuse it.p  pBottom line My goal is to just have the app download all the data from the json.php once at the first applaunch, and at later launches just check if the versions are correct. If correct, no download necessary what so ever, just use the stored JSONobject containing data, and the imagefiles from the urls downloaded the first launch. If not correct, delete all previous stored images AND clear the jsonobject, and import the new updated jsonobject, and saving the images from the imageurls from the jsonobject somewhere on the iPhone.p  pNote Updating the data i.e adding one extra image it that is all the change that has been made is not a solution, and not a possibility in my eyes here. When there has been an update in this database, I need ALL the information stored in the phones to clear out, and redownload all. This is because the information I put in the database, is parsed from another website, and if the new images or updates to the data contains changes of some other field, then I will much rather tweak the database to fitthrough json.php than releasing update for the app all the time.p  pIs this the wrong approach Is this possible Help is much appreciatedp  pEDIT JSONstuff from here and there..p  precodedefine kURL [NSURL URLWithStringwww.example.com]   NSData data  [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL kURL]  NSArray json  [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData data options NSJSONReadingMutableContainers error ampe]  NSDictionary info  [json objectAtIndexindexPath.row]  cell.textLabel.text  [info objectForKeyName]  Same for url codepre  pThis is extracted from different places in the class, so they might not work exactly like this..p  pEDITp  precode UITableViewCell tableViewUITableView tableView cellForRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath  static NSString CellIdentifier  Cell UITableViewCell cell  [tableView dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifierCellIdentifier] if cell  nil      cell  [[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithStyleUITableViewCellStyleDefault reuseIdentifierCellIdentifier]      Configure the cell...  info  [json objectAtIndexindexPath.row]  cell.textLabel.text  [info objectForKeyName]   NSString imageURL  [info objectForKeyImage] NSURL URLimage  [NSURL URLWithStringimageURL] NSData imageData  [NSData dataWithContentsOfURLURLimage] UIImage images  [[UIImage alloc] initWithDataimageData] cell.imageView.image  images     return cell codepre  pp  pStian.p

This way, whenever the ItemsControl changes in size, the Items change as well. A Grid is not needed. This solution only creates a relative width, but the same solution can of course be applied to the height of the items.

Negative 829 pI have a client app in c winforms that, among other tasks, receives real time logs from another app over a tcp socket. If I just add the log text to a richtextbox, the application is quickly bogged down. Obviously the user cant read text at the rate its coming in, but we have to ability to stop and start the system so we can look back through the logs. Is there a better choice than richtextbox I would like to retain the ability to color text and the ability to scroll back through the log. Would something in WPF work betterp

Negative 829 pI have started reading about CPU caches and I have two questionsp  p1 Lets say the CPU receives a page fault and transfers control to the kernel handler. The handler decides to evict a frame in memory which is marked dirty. Lets say the CPU caches are write back with valid and modified bits. Now, the memory content of this frame are stale and the cache contains the latest data. How does the kernel force the caches to flush p  p2 The way the page table entry PTE gets marked as dirty is as follows The TLB has a modify bit which is set when the CPU modifies the pages content. This bit is copied back to the PTE on context switch. If we get a page fault, the PTE might be nondirty but the TLB entry might have the modified bit set it has not been copied back yet. How is this situation resolvedp

Negative 829 pI have a Microsoft Dynamics CRM implementation either 2010 or 2011 in not 100 sure. This CRM system needs to call our internal service framework services from plug ins. p  pIn order to call the service framework we use an API with a login method that goes to an STS and gets a security token. This is per user to authenticate and get that users claims. The login call returns an IPrincipal object that we put on the Thread.CurrentPrincipal property and from then on we can call services with our framework and the user is authenticated for each call because of the principal on the executing thread.p  pIn an asp.net website we usually log the user in and immediately go to the STS to get a token, then cache that token for the user in session because the login is not something we want to do every time we want to call a service. p  pHow would I do this with a CRM plugin. Do I have access to a per user session store I noticed IServiceProvider is passed in as a parameter, can I add services to this container and solve this problem in a service with a thread safe dictionary of some kind I know very little about CRM development and Im even wondering if a plugin is the right way to do thisp

I convert the quaternions to euler angles roll, pitch, yaw. Then to check it, I convert roll,pitch,yaw back to axisangle as cAngle and cRx,cRy,cRz.

In addition, every user that is part of an album,can also add on it new users.p  pAll this is done giving to the users present in the album, the ability to create share the Share model relate the User and the Album model.p  pNow the big question, how I restrict the ability to addcreate share to a specific album, only to that users that are part of that albumthrough sharep  pIf for example I havep  pusers  id 1,2,3,4 [a total of 4 users in my appp  palbums  id 45,32 [a total of 2 albums in my appp  pshares  album 45  [user 1,2,3]  album 32  [users1,4] [a total of 5 shares in my app]p  pHow I can say in the Ability class that on album 32for example, just the user 1 and 4 can addcreate new shareadd new user, and that instead the user 2 or 3 they cantp  pI already restricted the ability for the user 2 and 3 to anyway access the resource album 32 I did that on the Album class level, but I want be sure that for whatever reason the ability to create users is restricted also.p  pWhat I have until now in my Ability Class isp  precodedef initializeuser    A ALBUM LEVEL        1 Every User can create Album, without restrictions      can create, Album           2 Only the user that own the Album can manage it      can manage, Album, userid gt user.id         3 The Album can be read by all the users that are part of that specific album      can read, Album, shares gt shareduserid gt user.id        4 The Album can be read by every user if the privacy attribute is false      can read, Album, privacysetting gt false     B SHARE LEVEL        1 Only the user that own the Album can manage all the shares for the album      can manage, Share, sharedalbum gt userid gt user.id        2 The other users in the album, can just manage themself their share      can manage, Share, shareduserid gt user.id        3 The Share in the album can be read by every user if privacy is false just read      can [read], Share, sharedalbum gt privacysetting gt false      cannot [create,destroy,delete], Share, sharedalbum gt privacysetting gt false     X CRUCIAL POINT CREATE NEW SHARE      can create, Share, sharedalbum gt sharedusers gt id gt user.id   end codepre  pIs the condition in XCRUCIAL POINT the right condition to allow just users that are already part of the album, to add new user to the albump  pThis is completely driving me insane.p  pThank you to everybody, and especially to who will be able to let me understand a bit more of all this.p  pBest Dinuzp

Negative 829 pIts my first time posting a question here, after struggling for a long while and not being able to solve it myself, I decided to come ask for your help.p  pTo ask my question, I need to first explain my situation.p  pIm writing an game for iPad using Actionscript3 and AIR SDK with Starling and Citrus Engine. Basically what my character does is move leftright and jump, the gravity in the game is always pointing downto the groundrealative to the player and the player needs to rotate the iPad to solve puzzles and advance throughout platforms.p  pTo move the character the user needs to touchand hold any half of the screen horizontallyif the device is rotated it will be the topbottom half of the screen, and to make the character jump the user need to make a swipe gesture on the upwards directionanywhere on the screen.p  pMain problem with this controls is that, for example, if Im using my right hand thumb to move the character to the right and I need to jump, the most comfortable way of doing it is to use my left hand thumb to swipe on the screen and make it jump. As soon as I do it, my character starts to move left, because my left hand thumb touched on the left half of the screen.p  pWhat I need is a way to make it possible to work this waybe able to move and jump just like in this example. Ive tried lots of ways, ignoring touch IDs, tried different Touch Event classes flashstarling, even some 3rd party Gesture APIs.p  pI think what I really need help with is the logic, and not coding.p  pI just cant get it to work smoothly.

Negative 829 pIm a junior programmer and I know the basics of pascal and c.

And I am not talking about something that seems more impossible Chess.p  pSo here I am, asking myself that there SHOULD be a way more simpler way the computer should search and solve some problems than tons of ifs. p  pIn this case, if any of you know any way of solving this, how can i manage to make the simplest procedure to block and beat the player in a TicTacToe gamep  pIf someone wants to check my code or use it a hrefhttppastebin.comjhyUn7d1 relnofollowhttppastebin.comjhyUn7d1ap

Negative 829 pOkay so I am stuck. In my app I have a product view. On this view there are two nested table views inside a scroll view. The first tableview is only one cell and holds static text. This text length is dynamic based on which proudct you pick. The second tableview consists of multiple cells based on how many sub products are linked to that prodcuct. So in iOS 5, it was pretty easy to dynamically move the frame of each table view based on how large the text was in the first table view. I could then just sum up the height of all the table views and that would be the height of the scroll view. The issue is when I turned on auto layout things got hozed. From my understanding scrollviews have changed. We cannot use the frame or content size of a scroll view. So the first thing I did was changed all that over to contraints. I did the following below.p  precodeCGSize descriptionSize  [descriptionDetail sizeWithFont                          [UIFont systemFontOfSize14]                          constrainedToSizeCGSizeMake320, CGFLOATMAX                          lineBreakModeNSLineBreakByWordWrapping]  self.theScroller.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints NO [self.theScroller setContentInsetUIEdgeInsetsMake0, 0, descriptionSize.height 43  [Solution count], 0] codepre  pNow this above works flawless. The scroll views scrolls great and is the correct height with auto layout on.p  pNow the part I am stuck on is how do I dynamically move the two tableviews up and down based on how long the description is or how many cells are in the second table view The frames of the table view dont seem to have any effect on where they are located. I tried messing around with the contraints but didnt seem to get anywhere. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 829 pSince Rails 4 removed page caching and action caching, Im wondering what is the Rails 4 way to cache an action that has no variables and has only html in the view Should I fragment cache the static html in the view How do I set an etagfreshwhen when there is no model to set it to expire with Im struggling to find an example or convention to caching what should be the easiest page to cache.p  pOne note is that while the view is completely static, the page still has a dynamic navbar depending on whether the user is signed in or not.

Im assuming if I didp  precodecache v1 do   all my html end codepre  pId have to remember to always change the cache identifier when the page is changed otherwise my app would serve stale content. Any way to automate this as well or is already handled by rails It would be nice to just cache the last time the view was updated or something clever so I dont have to keep track on when my static content is changed.p

So, my questions are 1 is it normal to app crash on launch just because MainActivity is extending ListActivity and 2 is there are viable solutions besides the one I mentionedp  pThanks.p  pLogCatp  precode0714 013847.957 ETrace2709 error opening trace file No such file or directory 2 0714 013848.899 Ddalvikvm2709 GCFORALLOC freed 163K, 11 free 2531K2824K, paused 60ms, total 67ms 0714 013848.906 Idalvikvmheap2709 Grow heap frag case to 3.202MB for 635812byte allocation 0714 013849.076 Ddalvikvm2709 GCFORALLOC freed 2K, 9 free 3149K3448K, paused 162ms, total 162ms 0714 013849.166 Ddalvikvm2709 GCCONCURRENT freed lt1K, 9 free 3149K3448K, paused 32ms9ms, total 95ms 0714 013849.166 Ddalvikvm2709 WAITFORCONCURRENTGC blocked 35ms 0714 013849.187 Idalvikvmheap2709 Grow heap frag case to 3.676MB for 500416byte allocation 0714 013849.336 Ddalvikvm2709 GCFORALLOC freed lt1K, 8 free 3638K3940K, paused 141ms, total 141ms 0714 013849.456 DAndroidRuntime2709 Shutting down VM 0714 013849.456 Wdalvikvm2709 threadid1 thread exiting with uncaught exception group0x40a71930 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 FATAL EXCEPTION main 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 java.lang.RuntimeException Unable to start activity ComponentInfocom.example.cellbotproxycom.example.cellbotproxy.MainActivity java.lang.RuntimeException Your content must have a ListView whose id attribute is android.R.id.list 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2180 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 at android.app.ActivityThread.handleLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2230 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 at android.app.ActivityThread.access600ActivityThread.java141 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 at android.app.ActivityThreadH.handleMessageActivityThread.java1234 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java99 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java137 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java5041 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java511 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java793 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java560 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Method 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 Caused by java.lang.RuntimeException Your content must have a ListView whose id attribute is android.R.id.list 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 at android.app.ListActivity.onContentChangedListActivity.java243 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 at com.android.internal.policy.impl.PhoneWindow.setContentViewPhoneWindow.java273 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 at android.app.Activity.setContentViewActivity.java1881 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 at com.example.cellbotproxy.MainActivity.onCreateMainActivity.java27 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 at android.app.Activity.performCreateActivity.java5104 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 at android.app.Instrumentation.callActivityOnCreateInstrumentation.java1080 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 at android.app.ActivityThread.performLaunchActivityActivityThread.java2144 0714 013849.476 EAndroidRuntime2709 ... 11 more 0714 013853.066 IProcess2709 Sending signal.

Negative 829 pI have a numpy array, and I want to get the neighbourhood of the ith point. Usually the arrays Im using are twodimensional, but the following 1D example illustrates what Im looking for. Ifp  precodeA  numpy.array[0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90] codepre  pThen the size 5 neighbourhood of element 4 is code[20,30,40,50,60]code, and this can easily be obtained by doing codeA[i2i3]code. p  pHowever, I also need the neighbourhoods to wrap around the edges of the array, so that the neighbourhood of the element 0 is code[80,90,0,10,20]code and the neighbourhood of the element 9 is code[70,80,90,0,10]code. I cant seem to find an elegant way to do this, so I end up having to use some complicated, annoying logic every time this comes up which is very often for me. In the 2D case the neighbourhood of a point would be a rectangular array.p  pSo my question is, is there a neat way to expres this wraparound neighbourhood operation in numpy I would prefer something that returns a slice rather than a copy, but readability and speed are the most important considerations.p

Negative 829 pI wrote a dll ccli library which uses my other c dll library. Ccli library works fine when Ive got c dll in the same folder as application which calls it. This library will be finally loaded to many applications and a C dll must not be copied into directory with application.

My suggestion is to load c library manually or to change path where f.ex. firefox is looking for dependencies, but I tried with LoadLibrary and AssemblyLoadFrom methods to force loading from right directory. Of course I added directory path with dll to system PATH. I work on VS2010.p

Negative 829 pI have tried to implement the logic with a token and a persistent token. The token gets regenerated for the cookie when the cookie is recognized. p  pWhat I dont get is how to implement it in the database. One example  if you google github rememberme is inserting a new entry in the db with a new token when a cookie is recognized.p  pBut in that particular example, every second time you want the cookie to be validated it will cause a mismatch due to that query wich does a pdo fetchColumn with the where clauses fixed on the persistent token and the userid AND LIMIT 1. This will always result in the first matched row and not the last entry wich contains the regenerated token.p  pI hope it is understandable because I am not typing code because I typed it on my iphone. What is the correct way if your base implementation revolves around those two rokend.p  pThanksp

Negative 829 pI am trying to do a delete behavior like iOS7 in ListViews. i.e. clicking on a  sign and animate translate the row which contain the  sign to the left where a delete button will show. Then if the user clicks on another  sign on a different row, the old row will animate back to its original position and the newly clicked row will translate to left showing the delete button. Now, there is no problem doing this on rows showing on the screen but scrolling the list down or up, some random views that are NOT animated before are being translated to the right the effect when canceling the delete. I know this is because of view recycling. I have tried so many times with saving position of opened delete button is shown row, setting tags to openedclosed, but there is no success, I still get un touched rows animated. I have missed around with the code so it wont reflect the problem if I post it , so please I would really appreciate any help.p  pP.S I am using codeview.animate.translateXBy[width of delete button]code i.e. codepropertyAnimatorcode.p

Negative 829 pI am having a devil of a time trying to get the debugger to work with my coffeescript files when testing with the karma test runner.p  pSupposedly, all I need to do is tell the Webstorm file watcher to generate sourcemaps and the debugger will work with the karma test runner.

So like thisp  ul liStart looping through the list, index i  0.li liFind the distance between the ith point in the list and all points that follow it in the list.li liRemove any points that are within 100 milesli liReindex the arrayli liIncrease the index by one li liIf i  list length, end, else, loopli ul

Then I would join the imported spreadsheet with the id table to create a new table with all of the spreadsheet columns plus the auto generated companyID.  Then I could append companyID and category1 to the category table.  Then do the same for category2 and 3 and so on.p  pThis seems really complicated if I have a lot of spreadsheets to import.  Also, the person who will be importing the spreadsheets isnt a programmer, so she wants it to be as userfriendly as possible.p  pIs there a better way to import these spreadsheetsp  pThanks  p

Negative 829 pIm not sure if this can be done, as logically it doesnt make sense to me.  Ive been testing out Postsharp aspects and AOP in general, and I can greatly see the benefits they can bring to a codebase. p  pI use RavenDB document database and sometimes I have tasks which basically they would have to create a session object, do some logic, and then call session.SaveChanges after.  This would be extremely beneficial for a codeTaskAspectcode which would basically do the session creation and calls code.SaveChangescode after.p  pThe main issue is that sometimes, when new documents are created in the business logic, one needs to call codesession.StorenewObjectcode.  The issue is that the session is not available in the actual method, as it would have been created in the codeMethodInterceptionAspectcode.  p  pBelow is a very basic codeTaskAspectcode implementation and sample logicp  precode[Serializable] public class TaskAspect  MethodInterceptionAspect      public override void OnInvokeMethodInterceptionArgs args              var session  RavenUtil.CreateSession          args.Proceed          session.SaveChanges         session.Dispose         base.OnInvokeargs         public class SampleLogic        [TaskAspect]       public void CreateItem                    var product  new Product             session.Storeproduct   lt how can I obtain this session, as it is created in the aspect            codepre  pThe issue as you can see is that the call to codeargs.Proceedcode doesnt know about the session.  Any ideas how one can pass such information  Does it make sense first of all, or is this logic flawed and I shouldnt be using aspects for this  p  pOne thought that came to mind was to store the session in a codeThreadStaticcode variable, but I think it is very ugly.p

Negative 829 pI have created a project on Eclipse on my machine lets call it PC1. It is a web app with some servlets and I use Tomcat to run. Instead of the code.metadatacode folder, I use the Tomcat installation folder to deploy. Every servlet is configured in web.xml to be reached at the URL code[host]myprojectmyservletcode. It runs fine on PC1.p  pNow I have pushed the project to a bare git repo and then cloned the repo in another machine PC2. After cloning I import the project to the workspace, create the server also here I set it up to use Tomcats folder instead of code.metadatacode and the server itself runs fine I see Tomcats home page, however when I try to run a servlet using Eclipses Run button, the following happens p  ol lithe browser points to code[host]myprojectWEBINFclassesmyservletcode instead of code[host]myprojectmyservletcode, so it ignores the web.xml configuration.li lithe browser displays a 404 errorli liin the codeWEBINFclassescode folder there is nothing, which I guess means that there is some build problem. li liany other file other than servlets e.g. jsp and html files in the Web Content folder is found by Tomcat and the content is displayed in the browser.li ol  pAny ideap  pFYI I tried to clean the Tomcat work directory which was mentioned in other posts on SO, but it doesnt solve the issue.p

Negative 829 pShort intro.  I have a largish excel file with an embedded PivotCache that I need to create a new pivot table in.

Negative 829 pAssuming that the webpage is static and only source of colors are present either in the CSS files or in HTML file itself, how to extract foreground background color pairs from a webpage.

Negative 829 pIs using global constants within member functions considered bad practice  I personally dont feel comfortable doing this, though I cannot explain why. It just does not look right to have that global constant inside the body of the function.  Is it better to introduce a parameter in place of the constant instead and default its value to that global constant  This is what I tend to do, and it does look better to me emlooksem better is all I can say though.  But after reading some posts below, I realize now that it would be nice to be able to override these constants for whatever reasons like testing, and we all know that this really isnt feasible if that constant appears in many places in the function body.  How do others feel about this  I use C, but I figure this question is languageindependentp  pBut for some reason, I feel fine using global variables in a function, though I sometimes wonder if I should also introduce a parameter for this and default it to that global variable.  This inconsistency of mine makes me wonder about the whole thing.p

Negative 829 pHi and Happy New Year p  pIm using Postgresql and I need a way to enable a worker process to lock a specific row, while that process operates on that row. It is essentially a table of actions which should be executed once and only once. Each process should grab a different row to operate on.p  pDuring this operation the worker process will calculate some value and insert into the database in a transaction multiple times it will alter between calculating and inserting into the database.p  pI dont know how long each operation will take it varies and I need a way to unlock that row, if that process diesgets killed or the system crashes so other process can grab that row and finish the operations on it.p  pAs far as I know, Postgresqls row lock last only in one transaction. I was thinking to add some flag, which would indicate if a row is locked or not into the table, but I have trouble figuring out how could I tell if that row is still being operated on, or is it hanging, because the worker process died in the latter case it should be taken by an other worker process I have a finished flag in that table to signal, that the row is finisheddone being processedp

Negative 829 pIve created a class called codeDBPDOcode that strongextends the standard PDOstrong class codeclass DBPDO extends PDO code in order to have all the methods and properties that come with PDO with the addition of more control on the queries ie. profiling when developing, etc... and methods that permit to speed up the work when coding queries.p  pId like to improve this class. Im thinking about all the connections that are created throughout the website, most of all are created inside different scopes to perform independent queries. So Im wondering why do I have to create ie. 5 connections on 5 different methodsclassesfunctions of my application, when I could use the same connection on all of themp  pI dont want to use persistent connections for example read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3332074whatarethedisadvantagesofusingpersistentconnectioninpdoWhat are the disadvantages of using persistent connection in PDOa.p  pId just like to have a class that  when instantiated  gives me an already active connection, if exists, or gives me a new one.brThere is a problem, though. What if I have to visit the results of a query and perform another query at each result I necessarily need two different connections. So Ill need to tell this new class if I want a brand new connection or a used one.p  pI was thinking of writing a new class codePDOConncode, with an static method codegetConnectionforceNew  false code and an static private property codeConnections  arraycode.p  pWhen I need a connection, I writep  precodedbh  PDOConngetConnection codepre  pPDOConn will look if codeConnectionscode already contains at least one connection in form of an instance of my already working codeDBPDOcode class and reaturns that object. If codeConnectionscode is empty, it will create a new object instance of codeDBPDOcode, adds that object to codeConnectionscode and returns it.p  pIf I want to force the creation of a new connection, Ill writep  precodedbh  PDOConngetConnectiontrue codepre  pSo it will create a new connection and adds it to codeConnectionscode. When codegetConnectioncode is called again without forcing a new creation, codePDOConncode will return the first created connection or maybe the last one.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongbr Do you think this is a good way, a good idea Do you have any better suggestion Most of all do you think that theres something I didnt consider in my codePDOConncode class functionality that could cause me problems Im not figuring out right now Do you think that writing a class like that is worthy to manage PDO connections I mean, I started this thread because I wanted to reuse connections when its not necessary to create new ones is this worthyrelevant or I can continue creating how many connections I want, it doesnt matterp  pThank you.p

Negative 829 pI have some SignalR hubs which may need to access some transient and singleton dependencies.  Hooking the creation of the Hub is easy and works just fine however SignalR does its own Dispose call on the created Hub rather than notifying the dependency resolver and letting it get involved in the disposal.p  pThis isnt such a big deal if the dependencies are registered singletons, but if theyre registered as transients then theyll never get disposed if that was required and Windsor will keep them alive until the Windsor container is collected when the web server is shutting down anyway.p  pI see several possible ways of handling this...p  pa Someone here points out a way to subclass SignalRs HubDispatcher class so that it can do proper disposal.  Its not part of SignalRs standard DependencyResolver so this might be difficult  impossiblep  pb Some other class in SignalR, elsewhere in the pipeline, can be overridden or easily replaced so that we could subclass HubDispatcher and ensure that subclass is used.  From what I can tell this would have to be the Owin middleware class HubDispatcherMiddleware.  Is there some way to force Owin to not register this class and instead register my own version of this which in turn uses my own HubDispatcherp  pc Theres some way of intercepting the Dispose call made by SignalR on my Hub classes so that a call could be made back to Windsor to ensure any dependencies are properly disposed and released from the containerp  pd Studiously avoid using transient lifestyle dependencies and instead pass in typed factories so that we can resolve and release each dependency via the typed factory within the Hubp  pAt the moment d is the only one I know how to do.  a or b would be great.  c is mostly covered by this post a hrefhttpkozmic.net20100127transparentlyreleasingcomponentsinwindsorhttpkozmic.net20100127transparentlyreleasingcomponentsinwindsora, however, the interceptor requires that Dispose be called via IDisposable.  SignalRs HubDispather class implementation of hub disposal isp  precodeprivate static void DisposeHubsIEnumerableltIHubgt hubs      foreach var hub in hubs              hub.Dispose       codepre  pNo casting to IDisposable there...  Also Dispose on the Hub class is virtual and that blog post implies that a virtual Dispose could add some complexity Im not quite sure how much and I dont know enough about Castles interceptors and whether or not that missing cast to IDisposable can be worked around anyway.p  pI appreciate Ive written this question for a fairly narrow audience  those who have used Windsor AND SignalR and care about more than just resolving dependencies.  Every example Ive found, including those on StackOverflow, seems to just ignore the release of dependencies.p  pThanksp

Negative 829 pI have a codeJPanelcode to which I add an codejava.awt.Appletcode. If I add an input listener, like a codeMouseListenercode directly to the panel, I will be able to receive events when I click on the blank panel, as expected. However, when I add the applet, which completely fills the panel, the listener no longer picks up mouse clicks, presses, etc. So I figured that I would try adding the codeMouseListenercode to the actual applet, but the listener did not receive any events when I clicked on the applet. I know for a fact that the applet uses listeners of its own, but I dont think that would be the cause of this, though possible.p  pI tried using a glass pane with the codeJFramecode containing the panel, and then adding a codeMouseListenercode to the glass frame and delegating input events to the component lying directly under the point at which the event occurred. I figured that way I would be able to receive events but not lose functionality. However, I found that method to be a little messy and I could not get it to work. Ive also tried using the codesetComponentZOrdercode function but that was confusing to use and I could not get it to work either.p  pWhat am I doing wrong How can I capture input events from an codeAppletcode or a codeJPanelcode containing only an applet p  pThanks.p

Negative 829 pI have a legacy application that runs on Spring 1.0 with Acegi security on JBoss 4. Our plan is to migrate one subset of the application to Tomacat 7 and Spring 4. The user will login to the legacy application but if they want to navigate to the subset that is being migrated they would be redirected to the new app. p  pMy question is how would I maintain session information between the two so that the user can seamlessly navigate between the two apps and maintain SSO. There would be no other information exchanged between the two servers. One constraint we have is that we have to make minimal changes to the existing legacy app. p  pAny help would be much appreciated. p

If one of the values in the arrays is not an emailadres they dont get inserted into the database, otherwise the values in the array will be inserted in the database. The remaining problem is that i dont know how to check for duplicates in the table. The table has 5 columns and for each value in the array it should be checked whether a duplicate exists in the table.

Negative 829 pThis question seems to already asked . But i havent got enough information i need.p  pI have been advised to use CURL script which is used to convert HTML files in to simple text files.By converting so, it will be easy for a web crawler to search for an information in those converted HTML files.In ruby on rails every HTML views are stored using the extensions .erb or .slim. And all the view files contains some ruby helper methods or p  precodeformfor  codepre  pkind of syntax within it. If CURL is used for conversion how can it convert the .erb files in to text file or .slim into a text file.Is it possible.

Negative 829 pI have a DIV with position absolute that contains an INPUT field, i need this input to be centered vertically and horizontally inside the div which i have accomplished with displayblock and text align, the problem is that the width property is not working the same way for IE 10 and below, the parent div have the proper width in chrome and firefox but a totally different one in IE10,9 and 8.p  pJust in case this information is relevant, the parent div is inside another div with position relative.

Negative 829 pI am trying to test a string for all pattern matches of several words which are the beginning of words.  If not all patterns matched, I want to treat the query as False.  The beginning of word testing is working, but I get duplicate matches, which I find surprising as I would have thought, that once one match was found for a word, it would not test again for that word.  Perhaps I need to restrict the tests to one match somehow.p  pI imagined if I was testing for 3 words, then a successful test would return 3.p  pThe return values are misleading as you can see from the example.  I am getting a positive value, which is greater than the number of words I am testing.  In the case of a non matching group, I am still getting a value higher than the number of words to be tested because of multiple matches of some words.p  pI guess I have not fully understood something or somehow I need to force an AND situation.p  pI have googled for answers, but none seem specific to my problem. p  precodeimage  After ABC DEF hello bugggy bad Sled bob bobert robob Triumph 2000 Roadster clearing bobby Sledmere  August 2014  error  result  pregmatchallquery, image, matches  query  bbobbugsledi   ALL MATCH Return Value 6 [ bob x 3, bug x 1, sled x 1]  query  bbobbugledi  Two matches led fails Return Value 4 [ bob x 3, bug x 1, led x 0] codepre

Negative 829 pI have a C app that is selfhosting SignalR 2.0.3.p  pI am disposing the OWIN hosting components the only way to shut down SignalR as far as I know shortly before shutting down the process, as followsp  precodestatic void Mainstring[] args    var signalrHost  Microsoft.Owin.Hosting.WebApp.Starturl   do things   signalrHost.Dispose   Console.WriteLinePress [Enter] to exit ...

Likewise the server is done invoking methods on the codeHubContextcode before calling codeDisposecode.p  pAnd yet I assume there are internally queued messages that then error out when I call codeDisposecode. That is to say, it appears that codeDisposecode does not wait until everything for SignalR is flushed.p  pI say that because my Console windows fills up with SignalR errors just before exiting, and connected clients dont get some of the final messages.p  pNow if I put in an arbitrary codeThread.Sleepcode before the call to codeDisposecode, everything shuts down cleanly.

Negative 829 pGiven a nontrivial Rails application with significant numbers of controllers and routes only accessible to authenticated users and even then, only by users with the authorisation, what is the most sensible way to test unauthenticated users and unauthorised users are denied accessp  pCurrently I generally test authenticated user flows through features, and fall back to Controller tests to test that routes are not accessible to unauthorised or unauthenticated users. p  pObviously ensuring that unauthenticated users get a 401 is easy enough to test, but testing authorisation is another matter. It makes sense to have granular tests for access permissions  I want to know if something Ive done has inadvertently given a guest the ability to destroy users  but adding such tests for every root balloons the number of tests drastically.p  pstrongHow should I approach thisstrongp

Negative 829 pI would like to have a patchqueue system like those offered by guilt or mercurialmq on top of SVN.p  pSVN is already able to export patch files, which represent the difference from the remote to the working copy. I can already use this, and create a patch every time I change something, but that patch would also contain all the previous changes I made. This doesnt usually create problems when applying the patch, because the redundant parts will be ignored.p  pEven so, I would like my patches to only contain the changes I made from the last patch I saved to the current working copy, so that they will be more flexible. I can delete a patch to revert it, or I can choose to apply only a subset of the patches. In order to do this, I think the only thing I need is a tool that can subtract two patches.p  pFor instance, given 001.patchp  precodeIndex myrepomyfile.h   myrepomyfile.h revision 200  myrepomyfile.h working copy  283,1 283,1      void f codepre  pand 002.tmp.patchp  precodeIndex myrepomyfile.h   myrepomyfile.h revision 200  myrepomyfile.h working copy  283,1 283,1      void f  Index myrepomyfile.c   myrepomyfile.c revision 200  myrepomyfile.c working copy  283,1 283,1      void f   codepre  pI would like to obtain 002.patchp  precodeIndex myrepomyfile.c   myrepomyfile.c revision 200  myrepomyfile.c working copy  283,1 283,1      void f   codepre  pOf course, this is much less obvious when things are removed or modified. Anyway, Id be happy enough with a hunklevel subtraction one that just takes 002.tmp.patch and removes all the hunks which have an identical copy in 001.patchp

Negative 829 pIn my AngularJS controller Im trying to do something relatively simple Im trying to populate a codeltselectgtcode element dynamically in the controller. To do so I need to wait for my localized UI text data to be loaded and data from my server to be loaded and this is causing a problem for me.p  pWhat my HTML Looks likep  precodeltselect  datangmodelgroup datangoptionsoptions.value as options.label for options in userGroupsgt ltoptiongtltoptiongt ltselectgt codepre  pThen my controller is actually implementing a base controller class which allows me to share logic between controllersp  precode exampleController.js myModule.controllerexampleController,     [scope, timeout, routeParams, controller,         function scope, timeout, routeParams, controller               Instantiate the base controller class and set its scope               to this controllers scope. This is how the base and child              controllers will share data and communicate.             var base  controllerbaseController,  scope scope  ] codepre  pAnd here is a relevant snippet of the baseControllerp  precode baseController.js scope.getDataFromUrl  function url, cache, successFunction      http.geturl,  cache cache      .successfunction data          if handleErrorInDatadata                      successFunctiondata                 scope.getDataFromUrluiTextResourceUrl, true, function data      scope.uiText  data  codepre  pSo codebaseControllercode fetches the text resources when it loads and sets it to the scope when its finished retrieving the data. codeexampleControllercode on the other hand will fetch other data from the server via the codegetDataFromUrlcode function defined in codebaseControllercode like sop  precodescope.getDataFromUrldataUrl, false, function data       Do stuff with the returned data...  codepre  pMy issue is coming from this part of the codeexampleControllercode code where I populate the data of the codeltselectgtcode element from earlierp  precode exampleController.js Continued...  scope.getDataFromUrluserGroupsUrl, false, function data      initSelectDropdowndata   var initSelectDropdown  function data      var userGroups  []       Parse data retrieved from the server and populate the ltselectgt bound data      array with it     var index     for index  0 index lt data.length index              var newGroup               value data[index],             label data[index]                    One of the data entries will have a value of , this group needs its          label to be set to the localized string No Group         if newGroup.value                        newGroup.label  lt  scope.uiText[NoGroup.Text]  gt                  userGroups.pushnewGroup            Set local userGroups to scope     scope.userGroups  userGroups  codepre  pThe problem Im having is here in the codeinitSelectDropdowncode function. I need to have both the data from the server and the uiText resource data from the server, particularly the line codenewGroup.label  lt  scope.uiText[NoGroup.Text]  gtcode where the data is being transformed in a way that is dependant on localized resources being loaded. I researched the issue and saw that using codeq.allcode might be a solution but unfortunately in my case there is no way for me to call codeq.allcode because the two calls to fetch data are being made from different functions in different controllers data being requested from child controller and resources being requested from base controller.p  pIn the view its easy to fix this because if I bind an element to codescope.uiText[SomeText.Text]code then it doesnt care if codeSomeText.Textcode is undefined at first and when it is eventually populated the UI will automatically pick up on the change.p  pHow can I make this work Is it possible to achieve something like how binding works in the viewp

Negative 829 pI am running into hardware issues that perhaps someone here knows a workaround. I am using a PC and windows. For several years I have been making interactive installations using video tracking the Jmyron library in Processing, which has functioned marvelously for me. I use this set up cctv type microcameras to a multiplexer, the I digitize this signal via a firewire cable to a pci card. Then Processing reads these quads sometimes more as a single window, and it has always worked from windows xp all the way to 7. Then comes windows 8 Processing seems to prefer the builtin webcam to the firewire bus. On previous version of windows, the firewire bus would naturally override the webcam, provided I had first opened a video capture in Windows Maker, and then shut it down before running the Processing sketch. In Windows 7, which had no native video capture software, I used this great open source video editor called Capture Flux. The webcam never interfered. With Windows 8, no matter what I try, Processing defaults to the webcam, which for my purposes is useless. I have an exhibition coming up real soon, and there is no way I am going to have the time to rewrite all that code for Open CV or other newer libraries. I am curious if anyone has had similar problems, found a work around Is there a way of disabling the webcam in Windows 8 temporarily of course, because I need it to be operational for other applications, or some other solution Thank youp

Negative 829 pHow can I go about listing the words a TST contains in an alphabetical order Unlike BSTs where an inorder traversal will do the trick, this wont work TST. Neither would preorder nor postorder traversals. More so, the nodes of TST contain alphabets not words as opposed to the nodes of some BST implementation. And there are some alphabets which not be included when moving from the left nodes to right nodes. I can seem to get my head around it.p  pThe figure below show the list of words of a TST in alphabetical order.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comWM2Vp.png altTSTp  pImage from a hrefhttpwww.geeksforgeeks.orgternarysearchtree relnofollowhttpwww.geeksforgeeks.orgternarysearchtreeap  pThanks.p

Negative 829 pI have a timer in my ASP.NET code using C that I am immediately changing its Interval for, however it never actually sticks when running on the server.  The timer continues to fire every 10 seconds.  I want it to fire after the first 10 seconds, execute my code codeLoadReportcode, but then wait 5 minutes to fire every other time.  The strange thing is debugging on my local machine it behaves exactly as expected, just not on the server where it will be running.  What am I doing wrongp  pstrongUPDATEstrong  This appears to be a ViewState problem, however I dont know how to fix it.  Not only is the timer not keeping its interval, but when I make charts on the page Visible they are not becoming visible.  Its as if on the server any dynamic code changes to the view of the page are being ignored, but not in development.

Negative 829 pCurrently we are working on an upgrade of the current system AX 2012 R1 to AX 2012 R3. After upgrading the code we started to test the security using the old security roles and discovered one problem.

I never saw this lock before and the role Iam using had enough rights to create and update records in the given tables before. p  pMaybe good to mention that this form has multiple data sources and its look like something goes wrong while switching the focus from one data source to another.p  pI cant find anything about this little locks, normally when I didnt had the createupdate rights for the given table the fields were just grayed out. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comfP9Uo.png altLocks on the form fieldsp

Heres the codep  pClient Codep  precode    var query  breeze.EntityQuery.fromParent     var predicateChild  new breeze.PredicateCHILD, any, CHILDID, , childId      query  query.wherepredicateChild      var promise  collectionsManager                 .executeQueryquery                 .thenquerySuccess                 .catchqueryFailed codepre  pServer Codep  precode    [HttpGet]     [BreezeQueryableMaxExpansionDepth  5]     public IQueryableltPARENTgt Parent              return contextProvider.Context.PARENT      codepre  pThe query does work, it finds the proper parent so it seems the childId is being used but returns all children, not just the one given in the predicate.p  pIve tried every way I can to get the results I want but Im sure Im missing something either in the server code or the EF layer.p  pIn an effort to get this to work, I changed the server code to use the child table instead of the parent. If navigation is set in EF from child to parent, this works, but that presents a circular reference when stringifying the data later downstream and I need to do this.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 829 pIm tasked with pulling several files from a remote server that uses its own TCP socket protocol.

When I request one file, everything works fine.  My delegate methods fire and eventually I end up with my file.  In the code example below, I prove this by uncommenting the break statement.p  pHowever, when I try to run several files, I get some weird errors and I think its because AsyncSocket doesnt guarantee the order in which it writes and reads to the socket.p  precodefor NSInteger i  0 i lt [files count] i      BJMFile file  [files objectAtIndexi]      if file continue     if file.remoteSize lt 1 continue      DLogasking for file, file.remoteName     NSString command  [getfile stringByAppendingStringfile.remoteName]     [socket writeData[command dataUsingEncodingNSUTF8StringEncoding] withTimeout5 tagi]     [socket readDataToLengthfile.remoteSize withTimeout5 tagi]      break  codepre  pI dug into AsyncSocket.m and found that all reads go to one queue and all writes go to another.p  pI need to wait until the first file is done reading before I write the command to get the next file.p  pHow can I do thisp

Negative 829 pI need to see where exactly browser puts page breaks in print preview, so I can modify that behaviour with CSS properties. In other words, I need to style page break itself for testing purpose of course, so I could see where the page break will occur, so that I know which selectors to modify with pagebreakafterinsidebefore properties.p  pTo clarify this, I am NOT looking for Chrome Dev Tools print emulation. That tool unfortunately doesnt show what will page look like in print anyone can compare its results with results in Print preview window accesed by CTRL P in Chrome or any other browser. However, that tool may be useful when you need to find out whether some of your print CSS rules overrides certain screen media rule or not. But it doesnt help much in situations such as this, when you need to locate exact positions of browserrendered page breaks in order to manualy modify page break behaviour.p

Negative 829 pHi Im working on a little project just for fun. It is basically just a text field where you can type in some short text basically only a few words and then you have 3 main buttons below it looks like a tab bar you have the option to press keyboard to change the text or type in one if you dont have, you can press colors to choose from different colors for your text or you can press the third button where you can change the font. So I just started and I have this issue that if I press the keyboard button the keyboard should appear and the textview should automatically move up for 216px the height of the keyboard I have the code belowp  pthe 111 in frame.origin are the ycoordiantes where it should move.p  precode IBActionkeyBoardActionidsender   CGRect frame  textField.frame frame.origin.y  111  [UIView beginAnimationsnil contextnil] [UIView setAnimationDuration1.0] textField.frame  frame [UIView commitAnimations]  [textField becomeFirstResponder]   codepre  pBecause it didnt work I run the app without making the textField the firstResponder so that the keyboard would not block my view and I could watch the textField through the whole process. When I then run the app and pressed the keyboard button, the textfield first went down below the screen and then moved upwards again to the same position it was at the beginning.p

Negative 829 pFirstly, my apologies if this answer is already on here, as Ive been searching for a few weeks and havent found anything yet.p  pI am working on an Android app which needs to allow the user to create and remove buttons. I know how to normally create buttons statically through adding the button the XML file and creating its functionality in the JAVA file.p  pInstead, I have a static button which Ill refer to as Create Button. When the user presses on the Create Button, they should be given the option to add a new button to the current activity, allowing them to change the title of said button etc. When they close the app and open it back up the button they added should still be there. Similarly, they should be given an option to remove buttons.p  pCan someone point me in the right direction Most of the sources that Ive come across only explain how to statically create buttons, like I first mentioned. p  pThanks for the helpp  pEDIT I was able to figure some stuff out based off of the feedback Ive been given. p  pSo far I have the following code in the onOptionsItemSelected  methodp  precode    if id  R.id.addbutton                   Button myButton  new Buttonthis         myButton.setTextPush Me         myButton.setVisibilityView.VISIBLE         return true              codepre  pI am still a little confused about how this can get added to the layout. Mainly, I am confused about the findViewById callp  precode    RelativeLayout layout  RelativeLayoutfindViewByIdR.id. codepre  pWhich id should I be using In the apps main XML file, there is no ID for the layout itself. Its just a RelativeLayout.p  pEDIT2p  pActually, I solved the problem. Thanks for the advice I just needed to give my layout an ID in the XML file. I knew that I could give buttons etc an ID, but never knew that I was able to do so for the actual layout itselfp

Negative 829 pWhen attempting to render a plane in my image, the whole image is being phong shaded.  I would like to just see the plane.  I pass an array of primitives to my checkForIntersection function.  tmin is initially set to 100, if an intersection is found this changes.  If an intersection is found and tmin changes then I cast shadow rays.

Negative 829 pIm trying to understand how Kademlia works in regards to finding a resource. There is pretty good description of now to build a node tree which is closest to the self node, how to find the distance between nodes, how to initiate the process etc. What I dont understand is how the file infohash fits into this picture. All descriptions tell us how to get into the play and build your own part of the distributed hash table but it is not it. We are doing this to actually find a resource, a file with a certain infohash. How it is stored in this node tree or there is a separate one How is it works to find nodes which have this infohash, consequently having the file.p  pThere is brief mentioning of the fact that the node id and infohash having the same 20 bytes length codes and something that node id XOR infohash is the distance between the node and the resource but I cannot imagine how is that and how it helps to find the resource After all a node id actually having the resource can have the greatest XOR distance to the resource.p  pThank you, Alexp

Negative 829 pSo Im trying to figure out how to change the background color of a page after a countdown timer has been activated. For example I have code below that displays a 500 timer that begins counting after selecting the Start Button. When you press Stop the timer obviously stops, and when you select reset the timer resets to 500 and pauses. I patched the javascript code together from two codes I found online Just now beginning javascript and it works however I am now trying to figure out a way to change the background color of the page based on the time of the countdown timer.p  pSo between 300 seconds and 90 seconds the color should be GREEN Between 9030 the color should change to YELLOW 30  0 the color should change to REDp  pAny feedback you guys can give me on my code and how to accomplish the task above would be greatly appreciated. Im just starting out coding so if there is a proper way of doing javascript let me know.p  pHere is the code for my Countdown timer javascriptp  pdiv classsnippet datalangjs datahidefalse div classsnippetcode pre classsnippetcodejs langjs prettyprintoverridecodevar seconds  300 var t  function secondPassed      var minutes  Math.roundseconds  30  60     var remainingSeconds  seconds  60     if remainingSeconds lt 10          remainingSeconds  0  remainingSeconds          document.getElementByIdcountdown.innerHTML  minutes    remainingSeconds    function countdown        starts countdown     secondPassed     if seconds  0  else          seconds         t  setTimeoutcountdown, 1000        function cdpause       pauses countdown     clearTimeoutt   function cdreset       resets countdown     cdpause     secondPassed              codepre pre classsnippetcodecss langcss prettyprintoverridecodecharset UTF8          CSS Document countdown      fontsize 2em     backgroundcolor white codepre pre classsnippetcodehtml langhtml prettyprintoverridecodelthtmlgt  ltheadgt     ltlink relstylesheet typetextcss hrefnewTicket2.0.cssgt     ltscript srcTimer.jsgt     ltscriptgt ltheadgt  ltbody onloadcdresetgt     ltspan idcountdown classtimergtltspangt      ltinput typebutton valueStart onclickcountdowngt     ltinput typebutton valueStop onclickcdpausegt     ltinput typebutton valueReset onclickcdresetseconds  300gt  ltbodygt  lthtmlgtcodepre div div p  pI am thinking that in order to change the background color the code should be something like thisp  precodefunction changeColor      if seconds  300          document.change.bgColor  green      else if seconds  90          document.change.bgColor  yellow      elseseconds  30          enter code here         document.change.bgColor  red       codepre  pHowever, I have not been able to figure out how to change anything without messing up the original product. The color change should be linked to the button click. So once the start button is pressed the color should change and continue to change according to the parameters above. Once the counter has reached zero it should stay red until the reset button has been pressed. Once the reset button is pressed the color goes back to green and goes to yellow, then red. So it should work in tandem with the timer I just cant seem to get it to work.p

Negative 829 pI want to create a save file dialog that opens when you press a custom ribbon button and has the filename and initialdirectory properties set to certain values.  Right now I create that dialog within a form.  In the designer it shows in the bottom pane as it is not an item that is drawn directly on the form, or so Ive been told in this quesiton a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions30283875visualstudiodesignerbottompaneVisual Studio Designer Bottom Paneap  pMy question is this Should I remove the form and create the saveFileDialog on its own  Or if I keep the form, when I call form.ShowDialog will it show the saveFileDialog I added with the designer  Or do I need to call saveFileDialog.ShowDialog  Which I cant do outside of the class.  Im not sure what the correct way to implement a custom saveFileDialog is.  I was once told to create a form, and now it seems like I should not use a form.p

Negative 829 pIm working on a text rendering system and Im trying to implement a mechanism for automatically scaling down the text size to fit inside a specified box.p  pWith word wrapping disabled, the task is nice and simple. All I have to do is check whether the width or height is proportionally larger, then scale the text down by that same ratio.p  pUnfortunately, with word wrapping enabled, the task gets much more complicated. If the text is larger than the box and I scale it down, the smaller text size might be able to fit more words onto each line, which might change the overall bounding box so that a different scale makes it fit the box better. Then applying that different scale might again mean theres a better way to word wrap it, and so on.p  pMost of the other solutions Ive been able to find are basicallyp  precodewhile isTooBig  DecrementFontSize  codepre  pThat would work, but could be very inefficient, so I was wondering if anyone knows of any lower level algorithms that deal directly with the text parsing Failing that, do you know of any open source programs which include this feature so I can get their source code and see how they do itp  pEdit Im doing this in Unity3D, but that doesnt really have any bearing on my problem since Im implementing my own text rendering system.p

Negative 829 pIm expecting a compile error , taking into account that a pointer has to be assigned in p, but the codes below doesnt give me error when i intentionally assign a pointer to s. By adding an ampersand amp, by right it should generate the address of the array and assign the memory address into p, instead of giving the value of the string. Unless I dereference the pointer, but I dont dereference the pointer at all, I never put an asterisk  in front of mypointer in printf. p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt int main     char words[]  Daddy0Mommy0Me0    char mypointer    mypointer  ampwords[0]     printfs n, mypointer    return 0   codepre  pplease look at this  p  precodeprintfs n, mypointer codepre  pMy understanding is , strongmypointerstrong with asterisk should give me the value of the string.  But strongmypointerstrong without asterisk shouldnt give me the value of the string, but it should give me only the memory address,but when I run this code, I get the value of string eventhough I didnt put the asterisk  at the front. I hope Im making myself clear this time.p

Negative 829 pIn my current android application, there are two activities.Parent activity launches the child activity.In this application, the child activity can also be run as standalone but it doesnt include the complete feature set. I am currently developing for AndroidTV. I verified by using  strongadb shell dumpsys activity activitiesstrong that when I run the standalone child activity application, then 1.While in Non Restricted ProfileNormal Mode  Stack trace shows the child activity as top most activity on launch, as expected. 2.When I enter Restricted Profile Mode  Stack trace shows another instance of the child activity as top most activity and the older child activity is present but has moved below in the stack, as expected. 3.On Exiting Restricted Profile Mode and relaunching app, it launches back the older instance of child activity as expected. I verified in DDMS that it shows both the processes once I have entered Restricted profile i.e it doesnt kill the older child activity.p  pThe issue is when I run the complete application consisting of the parentP and childC application. 1.When I run the application in Non RestrictedNormal Mode  Stack Trace shows C at top, followed by P which is as expected. 2.But when I enter Restricted Profile Mode, instead of moving the older activities below in the back stack, it removes them from the stack completely I understand that this is possible as Android OS can remove processes from stack in case of memory issues.But shouldnt  also bring them back on stack when required  Because of this, whenever I exit Restricted Profile and relaunch again, it somehow manages to get the older child activity but the older parent activity is not present and this leads to a blank screen.p

Negative 829 pI made a Java on IntelliJ IDEA application and I want to give it to someone via USB or Dropbox. p  pHowever I dont want him to give it to someone else, like you know, he downloaded the file, so he can copypaste it to his USB and give it to more people. p  pIs there any way to prevent the application from being copied after I give him the application At first I thought of making a login window, but then I thought hey, if he knows the password to login to application, he can just give the application to someone and give him the password as well, so login window is not an option I think. Can I disable the copycut functions with If statements after being copied oncep  pOr I can only prevent it by linking my application with a database and generating unique passwords to activate my application Like for example, someone requested to use my application, so I will give him the application but he wont be able to run it. Then I generate a password and sent him the password. However that password can only be used once so if he will try to use the same password on 2 different PCs, it will give him an error. Is there any guidetutorialtips of making something like that on Javap

Negative 829 pIn my programming Im scanning an IP range for devices that respond to snmp. Im iterating through a list of IP addresses and putting each on into its own thread and using the ruby gem snmp to test if the device responds to snmp.p  pThe main program does the threading and is written in java, the networking is handled by a jruby jar.  Im using a thread pool of 10 threads. Im after the first few threads run I start getting a SocketError initialize name or service not known on several of the threads when they try and setup a jruby UDPSocket. Its even showing the error on IP addresses that I know are snmp enabled. Ive dug into the jruby implementation of UDPSocket and it uses the DatagramChannel class which is thread safe. Im not quite sure what is causing this it almost seems like Im only aloud to make so many UDP connections, Im not sure if thats even true.p
