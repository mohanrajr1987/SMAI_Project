Positive 178 pIm working on a site with registrationlogin capabilities. Ive got a signup php file which just holds the signup form and posts the variables. Then Ive got a functions file which connects to the database this was done in an external file but I moved it to make troubleshooting simpler, a function which validates the form input everything is filled in, password is relatively secure, makes sure there are no current users with the email this user has provided, and then attempts to register. The signup form just runs the codesignUpSubmitcode function on post.p  pThe problem is that it crashes as soon as I attempt to prepare a statement. The code below works mostly. If I enter invalid data in the form dont type a fairly secure password, dont fill something in, it throws the error just fine. If I run it with the code to check for a user that already has this email commented, it works fine, just takes you back to the signup page. If, however, I uncomment even the first line of the commented code below codestmt  dbgtprepareSELECT  FROMcodeuserscodeWHERE email  emailcode, it just loads a blank page, as if theres some kind of syntax error. It must be connecting to the database properly, as if I mess up my username or password for the connection it DOES throw an error, where theres none if everything is set correctly.

Positive 178 p Not sure if this is the correct place to post this, please let me know if it isnt.p  pI have a Lenovo W540 which is almost 3 years old and has served me well so far.p  p2 weeks ago I finally got around to reinstall Ubuntu on it and I went with 15.04 previously I had an old version on it that was pretty messy after 5 semesters of installing various tools for classes and generally fiddling around with it. I also installed fedora 22 on the side to test it out.p  pThis week I had to install windows 7 for a different class. Had some problem with installing the WLAN drivers lenovos driver page is not exactly great but managed in the end. Windows Update took way too long to do anything so I installed a newer version of the Windows Update program manually. Afterwards it installed 200 updates in multiple steps which each required a reboot. But it worked in the end. I formatted the Fedora partition to give more space to windows Visual Studio is huge..p  pI then fixed the grub2 entries with the ubuntu livedvd and it worked, I was able to boot both operating systems without problems. That was yesterday. Today it was working well all day, had some minor problems in the afternoon when unzipping a 8gb zip file partially froze ubuntu and when I tried copying said zip file to a USB stick it got stuck after a while, which turned out to be because the other guy formatted it in FAT which doesnt accept files over 4.3gb... Removing the stick then threw some errors but wasnt obviously affected for another hour or so before I left. Now the troubles started when I got home. Ubuntu was booted but suspended lid was closed. I opened it and just browsed on Firefox for a bit, then the laptop suddenly restarted by switching off immediately, without any notifications or error messages. I rebooted into ubuntu and after logging in and a few seconds of using ubuntu it crashed again. I rebooted again, now it showed an error message after Grubp  precode [0.7xxxxxx] ACPI PPC Probe failed. codepre  pIm not sure about the number in the beginning anymore, but Im certain it started with 0.7. There was nothing else, just a black screen with that message. I googled around a bit and found that this message is usually accompanied by Starting version 219 which mine wasnt.p  pI forcerebooted 5s on the power button and tried to start boot windows, thinking it was something with ubuntu. Nope, just shows a black screen as well. After a few more reboots and trying combinations of withwithout battery and cable, it doesnt even want to show me that message anymore, after choosing an entry in Grub it takes a few seconds and it shuts down immediately. Doesnt matter which Ubuntu entry I choose upstart, save mode, older kernel version there are 2 entries or if I choose Windows, where it crashes after the Starting Windows text. I even tried MemTest86 but it also crashed after 2 minutes of testing. I also tried booting from a liveCD fedora was in reach, but it also crashes pretty much immediately. Some people online e.g. a hrefhttpsaskubuntu.comquestions613969acpippcprobefailedstartingversion219nvidiaherea  think that its related to Nvidia. This might be true because when I set up Windows 7 yesterday, I also installed the newest NVidia drivers. But as said, it worked and I restarted multiple times since.p  pI guess what Im asking is.. what can I do to find out what it isfix itp  pThe laptop is still covered under warranty but Im hesitant to call, since I use it daily IT BSc student and having to send it in would mean that I cant code in class for 12 weeks or more ...p  ptldrp  ul liLenovo w540 with Ubuntu 15.04Windows 7 2 weeks1 day oldli lishowed [0.7xxxxxx] ACPI PPC Probe failed. error after shutting down while using itli linow immediately shuts down seconds after Grub, no matter which OSsettingli liliveCD doesnt workli limight be nvidia drivers but I cant really do anything about that without accessing any OS...li ul

Positive 178 pMy app was working great until running it on iOS 9.p  pIn the AppDelegate, I check whether the user is logged in or not. If theyre not logged in, I send them to the login screen with the following linep  precodeself.window.rootViewController  [self.window.rootViewController.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierLogin] codepre  pAfter the user logs in, I attempt to send them to the main app with the following linep  precodeself.window.rootViewController  [self.window.rootViewController.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierTabs] codepre  pThis worked in iOS 8, but now it crashes the app. And its a bad crash. The whole device has to reboot although its a very quick one, so I think its more like a SpringBoard reboot or something.p  pIm seriously at a loss as to why the first line works and the second doesnt. Any help is much appreciatedp

And this looks extraweird even more, due to iOS 9.1 beta 2 is the only version with this behaviour. Moreover, building app with XCode 7 from on same git revision gives no success crashing app  it works as expected. Has anybody experienced such behaviour after trying your release versions on iOS 9.0.1 beta 2 Want to have some feedbacks of SO community before file a bug to radar. Appreciate your help, guys.p  pstrongP.S. Id like to emphasize that the issue reproduces only on that particular binary. Building it again from the same sources in XCode 7 doesnt produce a crash. So please, dont suggest how to debug such kind of problem, how to set exception breakpoint etc.strongp

Positive 178 pIve been having some trouble making my app backward compatible for Mac OS X 10.6 systems. Ive integrated Crashlytics into the app and it works fine for Mac OS X 10.7  10.10 and it works just fine. However, the app also needs to be compatible with the older version of OS X 10.6 and the Crashlytics framework only supports down to 10.7.p  pI already fixed the first crash due to the libc library which did not come bundled with 10.6 by making it an optional include. Its the next crash I cant figure out Symbol not found objcrelease If I completely remove all calls to Crashlytics inside the app it works just fine. However, if I include the one line which Crashlytics needs to get started code[Fabric with[[Crashlytics class]]]code it will crash right after launching with codeSymbol not found objcreleasecode.p  pThe next logical step for me was to add a simple if statement to check if the system version was compatible with the framework, but the app still crashed although if I removed the Crashlytics line the if statement worked just finep  pIm using Xcode 7, Mac OS X 10.10 with the base SDK set to 10.6.

Also the crash is very hard to reproduce so I cant use tooling such as NSZombieEnabled to gain more information.p  pBased on the crash report see below I have the assumption its because my apps NSWindow object is requested or informed to resize in an animated way hence, the timer and delay information but theres a button NSButton that is causing an issue probably its deallocated since Im having a SIGSEGV.

Positive 178 pThe app had been working fine up until i tried to make the UIButton lead to a new view controller. At first, when i clicked the button it just closed the app.  But now the app opens in the simulator, but only shows the splash screen before closing and showing me the AppDelegate.swift file, which doesnt appear to have anything wrong with it.p

Positive 178 pI downloaded fresh xcode7.0 from developer.apple.com When I run the application. Its continuously getting hanged and force to quit.

Negative 178 pI have a report that I built for a client where i need to plot x 0100, y 0100. Lets imagine I have these pointsp  p0,0 2,24 50,70 100,100p  pI need to represent these as a smoothed line chart, as the application of it is a dot gain graph for printing presses.p  pHeres the problem. The line draws fine from 100,100 top right down to 2,24. But then what happens is from 2,24 to 0,0 the line curves out off the left of the graph and then to down to 0,0. Imagine it putting a point at 10,10.p  pI understand this is because of the generic bezier curve algoritm it is using and the large seperation of control points, thus heavily weighting it.p  pI was wondering however if anyone knows a way I can control it. I have tried adding in averaged points between the existing control points but it still curves off the graph as if its still heavily weighted.p  pThe only other answer I can think of is custom drawing a graph or looking into dundas charts and using its GDI drawing support. p  pBut before I go that route anyone have any thoughtsp  hr  pHeres the the thing. I know how to draw the curve manually. The problem lies in the fact that there is such a high weighting between 2 and 50. I tried to add points in at the lows and the mids but it was still bowing off the edge. I will have to go check out the source and modify the graph back and see if i can get a screenshot up. p  pright now I just have the graph stop at 2 until i can get this solved.p
Negative 178 pLets say I have manytomany relationship using the ActiveRecord attribute HasAndBelongsToMany between Posts and Tags domain object names changed to protect the innocent, and I wanted a method like preFindAllPostByTagsIListltTaggt tagspre that returns all Posts that have all not just some of the Tags in the parameter. Any way I could accomplish this either with NHibernate Expressions or HQL Ive searched through the HQL documentation and couldnt find anything that suited my needs. I hope Im just missing something obviousp

Negative 178 pI have a page with some dynamically added buttons. If you click a button before the page has fully loaded, it throws the classic exceptionp  blockquote   pInvalid postback or callback argument.        Event validation is enabled using in configuration or in a page. For   security purposes,        this feature verifies that arguments to postback or callback   events originate from the        server control that originally rendered them. If the data is valid   and expected, use        the ClientScriptManager.RegisterForEventValidation   method in order to register the        postback or callback data for validation.p blockquote  pI am guessing the Viewstate field hasnt loaded on the form yet, the the other bits are being submitted.

Negative 178 pWe currently have an application that works with Outlook 2003. In order to get the owner of a shared contact folder, we simply call Redemption.RDOSessionClass.GetFolderFromID and then took that folder and got the RDOFolder.Store.Name property.p  pHowever, when trying this with a shared contact folder in Outlook 2007, the RDOFolder.Store.Name is null.p  pEverything still works fine for normal contacts and for contacts in Additional Mailboxes that Ive added to my account.p  pThe approach mentioned in a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.commstehlearchive20060907744798.aspx relnofollowhttpblogs.msdn.commstehlearchive20060907744798.aspxa appears to work, but I would prefer to not release a new version of our application unless I have to.p  pBasically I want to understand why this is working differently and what I can do, if anything, to fix this from the server end.p

Negative 178 pIm working on a table design that could involve many NULL values in about 10 fields maybe 75 of the time the fields would be unused.p  pI just generated some fake data a million records and could not sense any impact on SQL Server 2005.

Performance  no measurable difference after adding an index to the 3 nonnullable columns.p  pI know SQL Server 2008 has the sparse columns feature which I assume is going to be used on the next SharePoints UserData table.

Negative 178 pRookie question I know.p  pI have a table with about 10 fields, one of the fields is a category field. I need this field to exist because of the multiple types of categories. However, one category in this field is wrong and is duplicating results.p  pSo can I delete all records in the table that have Type320 in the CatDescription field, and how I want to keep eveerything else as it is in this table just need to get rid of the records that have that that in that one fieldp  pThanks very muchp  pEDIT Thanks for the answer, I did not know how to do this so this is very helpfulp  pHowever, this is more complicated than I thought. The raw data that I am supplied carries these duplicate records only duplicate in certain circumstances but they are easy to isolate. This raw data is given to me on a monthly basis in several spreadsheet forms.p  pIt all relates to these ID numbers, and has like 10 fields xls columns. As I said before one of these is the Category Description field sorry, this is not a lookup In certain places this records automatically duplicates itself on output because in the database this comes from, it has to have this sub category for one particular typep  pSo....every time there is a duplication, every single bit of information in all fields are exactly the same, with the exception of this CatDescription one is Type320, and the duplicated record type is Type321. However, there are some instances where Type321 is valid on its own in which case there is no matching data row with a Type320 catdescription. By matching I mean all data in all fields of a particular record.p  pA very clear absolute of this is if all fields data within of a record with Type320 CatDescription, matches all fields data within a record with Type321 CatDescription, then I can delete that record containing Type321 CatDescription. This is true because this is the only situation where this duplication occurs, normally not all of this should match.p  pThis allows all unique records with Type320 and Type321 data that does not match exactly to stay just a it should. This makes sense to me and hopefully you too  but can it be done, and howp  pthanks because this is way over my head. I would rather know how to do it in access, but an xls solution is equally as appreciate. heck i would do it in ppt if it would get the job done p

This is not really of interest to me though, as I generate schemas manually.p  p2 NHibernate will throw an exception if you try to save data that doesnt meet the validation specs.  This seems fairly redundant to me, since the data presumably will already be validated by whatever mechanism you choose before saving anywayp  pIf there are more benefits to NHibernate Validator please let me knowp  pOther libraries which Ive been reading a little about includep  ul liMS DataAnnotationsli liCastle Validatorli liSomething elseli ul  pIve also been thinking about using xVal to provide client side validation from the same set of rules.

Negative 178 pLets say Ive got a struct that consist of 100 bytes.

Negative 178 pRuby on Rails has polymorphic relations which are really useful for implementing functionality such as commenting, tagging and rating to name a few. We can have a comment, tag or rating class which has a many to one polymorphic relationship with a commentable, taggable and  rateable object. Also, a given domain object can choose to implement any combination of such relations. So, it can for example be commentable, taggable and rateable at the same time.p  pI couldnt think up of a straightforward way to duplicate this functionality in Hibernate. Ideally, there would be a Comment class which will have a many to one relationship with a Commentable class and a Commentable class will conversely have a one to many relationship with Comments. It will be ideal if the concrete domain classes can inherit from a number of such classes, say Commentable and Taggable. Things seem a little complicated as a Java class can only extend one other class and some code might end up being duplicated across a number of classes. p  pI wanted to know what are the best practices for modeling such relationships neatly and concisely using Hibernatep

Negative 178 pSo Im developing a new component that requires a little storage requirement. I dont want to use a full blown SQL Server database instance because it kind of defeats the purpose of this component. The first thing I tried was a Compact SQL Server database, but by default, ASP.NET does throws an exception if you attempt to use Compact SQL Server. I know also that you can override that with a line in the global.asax file, but Im not sure if that is the right direction, as I am assuming Microsoft has a very good reason why not to let use this on ASP.NET by default. So I turned my attention to sqlite, but so far the only linqtosql library avaliable is Dblinq, which at this stage Im not sure if it is production strength capable. So I guess what I want to ask is, is any of those options going to hold up for a commercial product the embedded database is not going to be high transaction system, it is just to store some user information and that is pretty much it. Does anyone have experience with a situation like this or Can you just recommend another embedded database linqtosql compatible p  pThanks and sorry for the long questionp

Negative 178 pI have a performance issue with WCF services hosted in IIS using net.tcp bindings.p  pWe recently ported our system from COM to WCF and tests indicate a performance degradation. Ive been looking at performance counters on the server and the CPU utilisation is very low lt 10, there is plenty of available memory, disk reads are normal etc... I also checked WCF performance counters and the number of outstanding calls is low at most 1 at any given time, number of calls per second is quite low 16 calls per second for a service that is being used the most by the system. All of our services are configured to be per call and single threaded...p  pI have already played around with throttling and set all values for all of the settings to 100 the server is an 8 core machine and my understanding is that the actual throttling values end up being what you set multiplied by the number of CPU.

Negative 178 pIve developed an application in C .NET 3.5 that collects a lot e.g. 40 channels, each sampled  400 Hz32 bits per sample for 24 hours of sample data from various sources.

Ive already implemented a simple ASCII file export. Export files are huge, but thats what to expect. However, it would be really nice to provide an easy way to retrieve data from e.g. Office 2007 by querying the application.

Some Googlefu and youre done ...p  pWhat about option 2 It would enable any application to retrieve data the user is interested in. Each signal could be represented as a table with two columns time and data.

The Line constructor then finds out if the passed user classesobjects are valid classes that can be processed. Only user classes that have a codeLinecode annotation for the class, and at least one codeCellcode annotation for its members are valid objects that can be passed into the constructor of the Line object. All other passed objects are invalid. The moment a valid user object is passed, all the available members that are tagged as codeCellcode in that object are transformed to Cell objects and added to the cells list.p  pMy questionsp  ol liis this possible to detect the annotations in this objectclass at runtime, and only for THIS passed object I dont want to scan for annotations on the classpathli liis it possible to detect the datatype of the codeCellcode tagged members This is needed because the Cell class doesnt accept all datatypes.li liis it possible to retrieve the actual member name specified in the java file so that the user doesnt have to specify the members Cell name.

Negative 178 pIm trying to inline SVG in a HTML4 doc. I was suggested that there might be some problem since HTML4 does not support inline SVG, so I should do it in XHTML instead.p  pInterestingly, although supporting inline SVG is not part of HTML4 standard, browsers using WebKit should be happy with inline SVG because its parser is capable of parsing HTML5, which duly supports inline SVG. Unfortunately, Firefox is not in the same league.p  pHowever, itll be fine for FF as well if I use javascript to append a SVG node to a  container in the runtimesee below.

Negative 178 pI had a general question on proper design of a php files and their storage on a server.p  pThe problem is this I had split a php objects functions into different php files, something likep  pFile 1 AndroidFlashCard.phpp  precodeclass AndroidFlashCard      public function retrieveCardspackname     public function retrievePacks     .... codepre  pFile 2 RetrieveCards.phpp  precodeinclude SERVER[DOCUMENTROOT].flashcardAndroidFlashCard.php connection  new AndroidFlashCard connectiongtretrieveCardsREQUEST[pack] ... codepre  pBesides the bad code smell regarded making seperate php files for a single function calls, the problem happens when the locationname of class AndroidFlashCard changes. Suppose we go with this shoddy design and I have 1000 different functions...p  pThe quick and dirty solution that came to mind was to have ANOTHER include filep  pFile 3 include.phpp  precodeinclude SERVER[DOCUMENTROOT].[location of class] codepre  pBut this doesnt really change anything, because if the location of the include.php file changes, Id have to make 1000 changes again.p  pSo lets think about this. If I have to keep making 1000 changes to 1000 php files that only include a reference to a class and then code to execute a function, then maybe THAT is the design problem.p  pIn android, I only know how to execute http requests, which is why I split the function calls into separate files.p  pIf I could get hold of that php object, it would make things easier, but Ive a feeling this will be difficult to accomplish.p  pWhat is the simpler solution Is writing directory structures a design part of production work, which after approval, is simply just written in stonep

Negative 178 pI am trying to setup password protection to use with certain files. I have followed an online tutorial, and get some success but in other instances keep getting a call to a page denying access despite what appears to be the exact same operations being performed.p  pFrom my login page, the login script calls a php login page, which should store session ID. I then have a separate page that checks if the session ID has been stored, and that page called auth.php is included in the pages I am trying to protect. I put the php code at the very beginning of the file, and as I said for some test pages it works but for the pages I need it for it reverts to the accessdenied page, which to me means it is not recognizing that the session ID has been stored.

Negative 178 pLets say I have a class like thisp  precodeclass A  public A A  codepre  pAnd expose it to Lua via Luabind like thisp  precodemoduleluaState      [         classltAgtFoo         .defconstructorltgt     ] codepre  pAnd finally instantiate it in a script like thisp  precodeA  Foo codepre  pWhat is the actual state of existence of A at that pointp  pIs it somewhere in the heap, and lua keeps a reference to it somewhere  or a luabindobjectp  pI have the feeling that it can only be a pointer, as in, allocated by new or equivalent.p  pHowever, I can bind functions to lua that accept references, like codeluadoSomethingA amp acode and what ends up in there will be an actual reference. Granted I know this could very well just be luabind passing codeacode as codeacode, but I have no idea if thats how it happens.p  pThe reason I am asking this is to understand and predict the lifetime of objects instantiated in a script at little better.p  pThat, and me being unsure if ownerships or lifetimes change if, instead of exposing the class to lua like above, I do it like thisp  precodeA  luaCreateA  return new A   moduleluaState      [         classltAgtFoo     ]   moduleluaState     [      defcreateA,ampluaCreateA      ] codepre  pAnd using it likep  precodeA  createA codepre  pBy the logic I understand so far, this case would require me to do the cleanup since Im the one allocating a new object, unless assignment like this for luabind would be the same as doing it with the bound constructor.p  pIn short, Im really really confused about object lifetime and stuff here... I googled for the keywords related to this, but  Im only getting stuff like a hrefhttpwww.gamedev.nettopic525692luabindownershipanddestructionhttpwww.gamedev.nettopic525692luabindownershipanddestructionap  pWhich isnt really what I want to know. I want to understand the concrete way how things are handled behind the scenes regarding allocation, instantiation, lifetime and all that.p

Negative 178 pI have a rather weird problem with a control that doesnt want to resize. Bellow is the XAML  Code behind of the control written in SL4. p  pSo to explain things rather shortly, the control has 4 regions  Header, Subheader, BodyContent, and Footer. Each region is represented by a Border element which acts as a container for its nested children. p  pThis control is merely to unify the look and feel of my application and doesnt really do anything as far as logic. p  pMy issue is that if I want to use that control i have to explicitly set its width. When setting its width with Elementtoelement binding to a parent container the control doesnt even render. p  pI also tried to create a  public new double WidthHeight properties, where Id set the width of the control itself and the width of the ControlBorder element. Using this properties also makes the control not render at runtime .  I also tried wiring the Size Changed event, but it kept giving me cyclic errorsp  pAny ideas on how to make this control more resizable The intended application is using it in a grid that employs a Grid Splitter. Its absolutely imperative that the control knows how to resize itselfp  pAny help would be greatly appreciated Thanksp  pMartinp  precodeltUserControl

Negative 178 pThe code below plots some simple xy data, but it has two problems that I do not know how to fix.p  pFirst, it plots negative values for some of the data points, which means lines extending southward below the xaxis.  Since the data points are selected at random, you may have to resize the frame a bit in order to view new random numbers to be plotted in a way that shows this bug.  All data values will be positive, so I want all deflections to project northward above the blue bottom marker line, and I need to make sure that no deflections extend southward below the blue bottom marker line.p  pSecond, the yaxis label takes up too much real estate on the screen.  It needs to be rotated 90 degrees.  However, all the examples I have seen for this involve rotating the entire panel using a graphics2d object.  I do not want to rotate the entire panel.  Instead, I just want to rotate the text of the yaxis label.p  pCan anyone show me how to change the code below to fix these two specific problemsp  pThe code is in the following two filesp  pGUI.javap  precodeimport java.awt. import javax.swing.  class GUI  GUI        Create a new JFrame container.

Negative 178 pIm experincing a very odd session error in a clients webapp that generates PDF reports from the admin system.

Negative 178 pIm making a todo list program using windows forms for one of my university assignments.

How would i go about to do this, what should i look upp  pSide note feel free to correct my title if it poorly describes what im doing, i thought it was better then using Listboxp

Negative 178 p Ive got a doubt, maybe someone can help me, thanks in advance  I need to know if it is possible to compile the best and newest package in an old, ancient system. Why Well Im limited at my company I need to develop an application in an old Debian 3.0 server and I would prefer to use newer software to accomplish my task. However Im not allowed to upgrade nor install any package Im just an employee after all u.u pfffp  pSpecifically, I want to parse XML files comfortably using xmlstarlet to do so. This server doesnt have it installed if I download an older version of xmlstarlet supported by the system its too old that I just lost the functionality I need.  It just has 3 dependencies libc6, libxml2 and libxslt1.1 which are installed but are too ancient for a newer version of xmlstarletp  pSO The question is Is there a way I can download this package and its dependencies they are few and simple, arent they and some way compile them to work locally I mean not necessarily on the systems path, just in a working directory without affecting in any way the legacy packages of the same name Is this even possible at allp  pThis system doesnt has PEAR either  nor PHP5, nor xmllint and I want to avoid coding in PHP4 to parse these XMLs  I really would like to work with xmlstarlet.p  pANY IDEAS THEN THANKS   p

I dont plan on removing any rows from the table ever.p  pWould you recommend I break up the table into two different tables.  The first table is MYISAM with Fields 1 to 5 95 read, 5 write from above.  The second table would be innodb and have two fields, the first is the codeAUTO INCREMENTcode that is the same as the first field in the first table and the second field is the one that is constantly being updated 50 read 50 writep  pThe two insert statements into the different tables are supposed to occur one after the other.  But in the rare case that the first INSERT statement goes through, but the second one doesnt, how can I enforce that the first fields of each table are correctly mapped to eachotherp

Im using it from C, using the instructions found a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuswindowshardwaregg487392.aspx relnofollowherea.p  pI have a problem with it though when the modem device is locked i.e., PIN is required, I want to set the pin programmatically and the continue to make a connection, but the latter fails with Pin is required, even though I just correctly set the PIN. p  pThe Mobile Broadband API offers the codeIMbnPincode interface to set the pin, but this is an asynchronous operation, so you have to register for the codeOnEnterCompletecode event part of the codeIMbnPinEventscode interface which signals that the operation has completed. I assumed this should be enough, but apparently it isnt. p  pThe class below is a minimal, selfcontained sample that demonstrates the problem. You can use it in a console application like thisp  precodevar testInstance  new MbnTest testInstance.TestXXXX  replace with actual PIN code codepre  pYou will also need an Interop dll to compile it, which you can find a hrefhttpdl.dropbox.comu80446Interop.MbnApi.dll relnofollowhereap  pThe test class contains a ManualResetEvent field to coordinate between the Enter and OnEnterComplete methods.p  pIn the Test method, I subscribe to the IMbnPinEvents, instantiate the IMbnPin, call the asynchronous codeEntercode method and call codeManualResetEvent.WaitOnecode to block the current thread.

Perhaps Biopython has this capability  If I cannot use Blast Two Sequences, I will compare different versions of SmithWaterman, but this would not be nearly as exciting   OR, if anyone has another idea for a great senior year project in Bioinformatics involving comparing pairs of proteins, please dont hesitate to let me know Thank you in advance.p

Negative 178 pIm using QT4 and I created a QGLWidget in which I want to implement a rightclick context menu. I want the context menu to appear only when the rightmouse button is clicked and the CTRL key is pressed down.p  pI tried implementing this by setting a control flag when the CTRL key is pressed, and then clearing it when the CTRL key is released via a codekeyReleaseEventcode. The problem is that I dont receive a codekeyReleaseEventcode when the context menu is up not just CTRL, no key release at all.p  pFor example I hold down CTRL, click the right mouse button, and then the context menu appears still holding CTRL. Without selecting anything in the menu, I release the CTRL key, but my program does not receive a codekeyPressEventcode. Therefore my flag never gets cleared, and the next time the user right clicks even without holding control the context menu will appear.p  pWhy dont I receive a codekeyPressEventcode when a context menu is presentp  pIm using QT 4.8 C and tested this on both Windows and Linux with the same result.p

Negative 178 pOne day I have decided to test my java skills by building a simple chess game. It took me some time and after a while I finished it. Now the problem starts here I wanted to send my friends my game so I created a runnable jar file through Eclipse. Surprisingly the game inside the runnable jar file showed some strange behaviors like Pieces appearing where they shouldnt appear and some other weird bugs, but without any exceptions. I was even more surprised when I realized that when I run the project inside Eclipse itself everything works like it should. I also tried to create a normal jar file through Eclipse and run it, but I got the following NPE errorp  precode010512 194730.433 [0x00x54054].com.apple.JarLauncher Exception in thread main   010512 194730.498 [0x00x54054].com.apple.JarLauncher java.lang.NullPointerException  010512 194730.498 [0x00x54054].com.apple.JarLauncher  at sun.launcher.LauncherHelper.getMainClassFromJarLauncherHelper.java399  010512 194730.498 [0x00x54054].com.apple.JarLauncher  at sun.launcher.LauncherHelper.checkAndLoadMainLauncherHelper.java463 codepre  pI have already posted one question about this on this website, but I didnt get a proper answer so I am posting also this question.

Negative 178 pHeres the situation p  pA while ago, I created a backend interface for addingmodifyingdeleting items in a DB. It was created as an individual project, and we are still using that particular instance of the code. I will call this version 1.p  pA little while after I completed this, I duplicated the code and integrated it into a much larger project. I copied all of the DB tables that were used in the original projects DB into the DB that this project was already using. I also had to duplicate the frontend here, but its the backend that Im concerned with. The requirements for this interface I will call this version 2 were a bit more complex, so I had to keep working on it and also make some modifications to the DB tables. p  pIt is essentially 2 branched versions of the same interface. However, version 1 has not received much attention since version 2s conception. Some of the changes I made in version 2 were not just new features, but improvementsbug fixes that are relevant to version 1. I should have made these changes on version 1 as well, but unfortunately I didnt. Going forward I will need to make improvements to both versions, and some of these improvements will apply to both of them.p  pI would really like to merge the 2 interfaces somehow, as Im quite sure that it will reduce my workload in the long run. Frankly, I would like to emabandonem version 1 and adapt the version 2 UI to version 1s DB. p  pMy first instinct is to transport everything to a user control that has a version attribute. The version would then be used to hideshow the controls that are or arent relevant to that version, and it would also be used to determine what DB queriesstored procedures to use. The issue with this is that this whole interface spans across 5 pages. A few of these pages are opened up as dialogs from another one of the 5 pages. I suppose that I could simply have one div per interface, and then when IsPostBack, I can set the Visible property of each div according to a querystring variable. However, this seems like it would be awfully messy and it would be a LOT of code and markup on one page. I guess alternatively I could have 5 user controls, but this just seems like an odd design.p  pAre there any other viable solutionsp

The packages directory is included in the project.p  precodeImports MySql.Data Imports MySql.Data.MySqlClient Public Class TestClass      Public Sub Load         Dim da As MySqlDataAdapter  New MySqlDataAdapter  NullReferenceException thrown here.

Weird. Please correct me, Id like to know a bit more.p
Negative 178 pIm trying to build a database for a small company to record its expenses and then generate reports to analyse the expenditure. Im having trouble with one report that I want to do. Id like the report to compare time periods as specified by the user and present the data on a graph.p  pFor example, the data is structured as followsp  pDate  Expense Classification  Amountp  pNow, Id like the user to be able to select two time periods through a query for comparison purposes and show the total amounts spent on each expense classification during those two periods and graph them on a pivot chart.p  pSo, for example the query will allow the user to say, choose to compare the following period Period 1 010412 to 150412 and period 2 150412 to 300412. The report should now arrange the data so it is grouped by expense classification examples include utility bills, stationery expenses, petty cash expenses, general expenses etc. and provide the total amount spent as per each classification in both time periods.p  pCan someone please help me out with this. Ive tried using crosstab queries but I cant limit the data to show only the periods I want. Ive tried Union queries and still dont get the result I need. Ive tried building report based on several different queries as well and cant get the graph to plot the data properly. p  pAny help on this would be appreciated.p  pThanksp
Negative 178 pI am investigating using an inline formset for a django app to populate a 1many relationship.  I finally got a inline formset working and I noticed that it shows all of the data in a single form.  This is great for one of my users.    However, I have another use case where the user is not allowed to see any of the existing data.  The user can add new data, but is not allowed to see any existing records.p  pIs it possible to use an inline formset to do this   Can you have an inline formset hide all existing data rather than display everything in the 1many relationship  If so, How  Any examplesp

How can I do thisp  pstrongEditstrong Im adding in a picture to hopefully describe a little better what I want to do. In step 1, the user inputs a name for this group of queries. This group is associated with a system 2 and a predefined group within the system 3 think of 3 as a customer or a region, etc and 1 and 3 are NOT the same thing, despite the similar naming. They then select Save and Continue editing on this inline form and the drop down at step 4 becomes populated with information from the above form. Once step 4 has a selection made, I want 5 to populate with data only from the associated system. Since 2 contains this information, I am hoping it is fairly easy to do this, but I cant figure out the chaining. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRnCKj.png altDemo dashboardp  pI also realized that I didnt mention I was using a hrefhttpsgithub.comdigi604djangosmartselects relnofollowdjangosmartselectsap

Unfortunately, there doesnt seem to be an easy way to disable the slider.p  pOne way to get rid of the transparency is to just create a new color based on the selected one but removing the alpha value. However, this gives a false impression to the user as the slider now effectively does nothing and I would hate to have a useless UI element around.p  pSo my question is, whats the best way to get rid of the transparency sliderp  pP.S. IMO, its weird that they would just add the slider and make it the default behavior. This might cause a lot of bugs in JDK 6 programs that do not expect the color chooser to return a color with an alpha value.p

But after following these steps when i restarted my computer there was no separate linux 3.2.17 OS. But my ubuntu 12.04 was now showing 3.2.17 kernel. Although this is the first time i could compile a whole kernel on ubuntu without any error, i want to load that kernel on other partition and use itt as an independent OS. So, if anyone can tell, what to do in addition to the steps in the tutorial so that i can achieve this p

When creating a matrix, one would first start out with a list of lists and they would create a matrix likep  precodegtgtgt startingList  [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] gtgtgt matrix.MatrixstartingList [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] codepre  pThis should create a codeMatrixcode. The created codeMatrixcode should contain multiple codeDimcodes all of the same length. Each of these codeDimcodes should contain multiple codeDimcodes all of the same length, etc. The last codeDimcode, the one that contains numbers, should contain only numbers and should be a codeVeccode instead of a codeDimcode. p  h3The Problemh3  pAll of this works, for lists. If I were however, to use an iterator object instead such as that returned by codeitercode this does not function as I want it to. p  pFor examplep  precodegtgtgt startingList  [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] gtgtgt matrix.MatrixiterstartingList     [] codepre  h3My Thoughtsh3  pIm fairly certain that this is happening because in codeDim.newcode I iterate over the input iterable which, when the same iterable is then passed to codeMatrix.initcode it has already been iterated over and will therefore appear to be empty, resulting in the empty matrix that I get. p  pI have tried copying the iterator using codeitertools.teecode, but this also doesnt work because I dont actually call codeMatrix.initcode it gets called implicitly when codeMatrix.newcode returns and I therefore cannot call it with different parameters than those passed to codeMatrix.initcode. Everything I have thought of to do comes up against this same problem. p  pIs there any way for me to preserve the existing functionality and also allow codematrix.Matrixcode to be called with an iterator objectp

Negative 178 pI have been writing C code for 10 years, but I am woefully weak on knowing exactly when to use an interface vs. using a Func or Action. It seems to me that in many places where a method on an interface is called, a Func or Action would work just as well. So, I guess my question is this. If I have an interface with just a single method, or perhaps a couple methods, is there any disadvantage to using a Func or Action instead Using a Func or Action seems cleaner to me.p  pThanks very much.p

Because of this the page load takes like 23 seconds now. p  pI thought it would be good to show a progressbar while it loads so the user knows that the page is getting loaded instead of them staring at a white screen. When looking up the jquery UI progressbar i found out that it has a value attribute which determines the length of the bar. p  precode progressbar .progressbar value 37 codepre  pNow as i already told my js file has one huge codedocument.readyfunction  ...... code which loads the whole page. How do i get that value of how much the page has loaded so that i can pass it to the value attribute of the progressbar  p

Negative 178 pI am writing an HttpModule in C, and have written a number of unit tests to test the code.p  pThe module is pretty simple, all it does is that it inspects a number of cookies, and expires the ones that need to be expired based on our business logic. p  pBut I want to make sure that this does not break anything.

Negative 178 pWe have implemented a solution to give our internal users a nag message that they need to redeploy our application.

So thread handling the GET is returned to the POOLli liThen I wait until the thread A completes to do anything else.li liSo No threads are running as far as I know. Both the thread that was handling the GET and THREAD A has exited.li ol  pI make the same request a few times SEQUANTIALLY. I always wait for both threads to exit.  After a while Thread.Start1 function blocks.p  pQuestions  I know that the threads are returning and I am not leaking any ghost threads.  Why does IIS not allowing me to start new threads after a like 45 requests. p  pWhat is the right way to create application thread for the user application.  If I said codeThread t new Threadcode, does this allocate a thread from the pool that handled the GETS or CLR I am using IIS7.p  pI know that I exit each thread, I call a JOIN on THREAD A , and it never blocks, and at this point I am not worried about scalability so I always have  ONE user hitting the server sequentially. p

Negative 178 pOur project is a MMORPG, using codescaleformcode to render UI. Now we use codeFlash CS5code to create UI panels with codescaleform CLIKcode. With the development of this project, we encountered some problemsp  ol lipcodeCLIKcode is not skinned, we have to create separate symbols for each component with different disappearance, so we have codePushButton1code, codePushButton2code, codeRadioButton1code, codeRadioButton2code...pli lipcodeFlash CS5code is not a emWhat You See is What You Getem tool. For instance, we have a shared component named codeWindowcode, it has a codeclosecode button as its child. In a codeflacode, we first pull a codeWindowcode on the stage, and modify its size, the codeclosecode button will be scaled in the stage. We can constrain the codeclosecode button in as code, but artists have to see the right result in codeGfx Playercode on runtime.pli lipWe have some common components codeflacode like codecommonbutton.flacode with most of button components in it. Common components are runtime shared in different codeflacode. In a UI codeflacode e.g. codefriendpanel.flacode, when we need a common component, we copy it from codecommonxxx.flacode and paste it in the new codeflacode library. If a panel is complex, its library will be confused and not easily managed. If the common one is not satisfying requirement, we will doubleclick the pasted component and modify it in the local codeflacode, and this caused more resource management troubles.pli ol  pSo I consider if we should create a skinned UI component lib and an UI editor to handle this problems. Does any one has similar experiencep

Because of this, Im caching the data in HttpRuntime.Cache, which I understand to cache data for all users of the website.p  pHowever, I also want to offer the ability to force a refresh in case cache data becomes stale.  Since the data is cached for all users, this means that if a few people are using the site at once, itll affect everyone.

Negative 178 pThis is a random question I think and it has more to do with style and organization. I have a web application where I connect with a MySQL database using PDO and in some scripts there are a lot of queries one after the other which dont necessarily concern the same tables. i.e I will execute a SELECT statement in one, and then depending on some values I will UPDATE another and finally go and DELETE from another one.p  pThe thing is I only recently learned PHP and MySQL and because I wasnt sure and wanted to be careful and to find easily any problems and a little because I am a little ocd and anal about silly things like uniformity and coding style in every query I used the following formatp  precodetry      statement           UPDATESELECT   ...

How do I make my code more manageable Is there some fundamental error in my logic on structure the way I wrote it Is there some rule for using trycatch Is it more for developing and debugging and afterwards you can remove some blocks of itp  pI was thinking of making a function of just this block of code and calling it with the statement as a parameter. So I would just type the query in the main body and then call the function where it would be prepared, executed and then return the result. Of course then I would always use fetchAll and would return an associative array but I think as long the datasets are small the memory usage would be fine in any case in nowadays systems it should take A LOT to notice a difference, I think...p  pAny thoughts are welcome.p  pI realize this is not actually a problem with code and settings and sw and programs like other questions in here but I do hope it still follows the spirit.p

Negative 178 pI have some doubts about this topic. In our application for most Spring beansdaos, services and controllers we use request scope. This approach allows us decrease memory usage and create stateless tiers. But in other hand we loose perfomance on every request on Spring context initializing. I think about creation some beans, e.g. DAO layer, in singleton or prototype scope.p  pWhat techniques do you use in your applications Maybe exist some advices for designing Spring Web application beans scopesp

But we had one problem and now I am again got it. p  pProblem is p  blockquote   phow to design database structure, if some records that have references   can be deleted from Software Interfacep blockquote  pSimple Example Assume that, you have tables   p  precodeStudents, StudentClass, Marks, Classes codepre  p.  So, if I try to delete record from codeClassescode table, it will be impossible, because codeStudentClasscode table has reference to codeClassescode table. Of course, it is possible delete records from depending tablescodeStudentClass, etc.code and then delete codeClassescode record, but i need to keep data.p  pI found solution, in all tables that is referenced by other, i create column codeIsDeletedcode. It means that If i want to delete record from codeClassescode table, i just update codeIsDeletedcode column to code1code. To show to users, i use codeSELECT  .... FROM ... WHERE Classes.IsDeleted  0.codep  pThis my solution Can you tell me, how you solve such problems, share with me your approaches, pls Any opinions will be interesting for me Thanks in advance for your replyp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pAny solutions elsep

Negative 178 pstrongEDITstrong I modified the question a bit. I did now actually implement my example. Before I transferred my actual code to a simpler example which actually did some thing different in the end.p  pI am wondering if it is save to assume that the Android UI thread is working similar to the Swing UI thread with respect to that future UI events are only scheduled at the end of the execution queue when calling e.g. Activity.startActivity. I remember that when I learning Swing many years ago, you actually scheduled a Runable for execution on the end of the queue. I imagine this is similar for Android, where the Activity scheduled by e.g. Activity.startActivity only will get rendered afterp  ol liThe yet to complete stack of activity life cycle method calls onStart, onPause, onStop, etc returned.li liAny other scheduled event on the UI thread is completed other Activities that were previously set to become active by calls to e.g. Activity.startActivity.li ol  pHowever, this is only partially what I observedp  pemMainActivityemp  precodepublic void onCreateBundle b   forint i  0 i lt 3 i    Log.dTAG, Schedule OtherActivity   i   startActivitynew Intentthis, OtherActivity.class.putExtrainstance, i   Log.dTAG, Done scheduling OtherActivity   i    public void onResume   Log.dTAG, Resumed MainActivity  codepre  pemOtherActivityemp  precodepublic void onCreateBundle b   int instance  getIntent.getIntExtrainstance, 1  Log.dTAG, Created OtherActivity   instance  startActivitynew Intentthis, YetAnotherActivity.class.putExtrainstance, instance  public void onStart   Log.dTAG, Started OtherActivity   getIntent.getIntExtrainstance, 1  finish  public void onStop   Log.dTAG, Stopped OtherActivity   getIntent.getIntExtrainstance, 1  codepre  pemYetAnotherActivityemp  precodepublic void onCreateBundle b   Log.dTAG, Created YetAnotherActivity   getIntent.getIntExtrainstance, 1  public void onStart   Log.dTAG, Started YetAnotherActivity   getIntent.getIntExtrainstance, 1  finish  public void onStop   Log.dTAG, Stopped YetAnotherActivity   getIntent.getIntExtrainstance, 1       codepre  pwould result inp  precodeSchedule OtherActivity 0 Done scheduling OtherActivity 0 Schedule OtherActivity 1 Done scheduling OtherActivity 1 Schedule OtherActivity 2 Done scheduling OtherActivity 2 Created OtherActivity 2 Started OtherActivity 2 Created YetAnotherActivity 2 Started YetAnotherActivity 2 Created OtherActivity 1 Started OtherActivity 1 Created YetAnotherActivity 1 Started YetAnotherActivity 1 Created OtherActivity 0 Started OtherActivity 0 Created YetAnotherActivity 0 Started YetAnotherActivity 0 Resumed MainActivity Stopped OtherActivity 2 Stopped YetAnotherActivity 2 Stopped OtherActivity 1 Stopped YetAnotherActivity 1 Stopped OtherActivity 0 Stopped YetAnotherActivity 0 codepre  pWill this always be the turn out or can Android execute this example in another order than this I was assuming that UI events are inherently synchronized since they are scheduled in a particular order as I observed it. However, I cannot figure out how the actual scheduling works.p  pI did for example not expect that some UI events i.e. ConstuctoronCreateonStartonResumeonPause are always scheduled to the front of the execution queue whilst some events are scheduled to its end i.e. onStoponDestroy. But according to this theory, why is the OtherActivity destroyed before YetAnotherActivity And how does onResume end up at the beginning of the execution queue all of a suddenp  pCan somebody explain how UI scheduling works in general Thanks for any feedback on my thoughts p
Negative 178 pHi Im building an app that pulls my address using gps and then compares it to an address i saved to a .txt file in a website. It pulls the .txt file fine. Then the gps gets lat and long fine and also reverse geocodes fine. I typed the txt perfect I put the two textviews right on top of each other using a relative layout to see if I could find a difference. Ive also thought maybe, the web files are not text at this point but maybe some kind of xml so I converted it to a string put them in another textview and then compared those two as strings and still it will not show them as a match. p  precode    public class MainActivity extends Activity   Button compareButton Button addressButton TextView locationText TextView addressText TextView internetText

Negative 178 pI have a Client Server application. The client sends commands to server and receives the data on a UDP socket channel.br Each time the socket file is created with a different id.br I am executing the command 10000 times using a script and I get codeEBADFcode. The problem I am suspecting is that the codeclosecode does not closes the socket descriptor immediately. I have read about SOLINGER options but I think it works for TCP socket.p  pIs there any way to ensure that codeclosecode closes the socket descriptor.p  pThanks p

Negative 178 pSo Ive been working on a natural language processing project in which I need to classify different styles of writing. Assuming that semantic features from texts have already been extracted for me, I plan to use Weka in Java to train SVM classifiers using these features that can be used to classify other different texts. p  pThe part Im having trouble on is that to train an SVM, the features must be converted into a feature vector. Im not sure how you would be able to represent features such as vocabulary richness, ngrams, punctuation, number of paragraphs, and paragraph length as numbers in a vector. If somebody could point in the right direction, that would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 178 pI got a small app that can contains about 50 views in the same page. Imagine a page with a listview that contains 50 items, each item got its view.p  pSo I want to remove all that without doing memory leaks, question is, what is the most efficient way to do thatp  pFrom what I see I cant just delete the top view, I need to save all those views in a variable and call remove on everyone one of them, but that seems terribly inefficient.p  pAlso, Would it be wrong to say that if a view has no event binded with listento, it will be garbage collected even if I do not call explicitly remove on it if I remove the DOM elementp  pThanksp

Negative 178 pI am currently working on a Rails app and I will need to include an interactive banner on the homepage. As of right now, I only have a few static pages which function as the landing pages for the full site.p  pFor this particular banner, we will need to present a few options available to new users who wish to sign up with our service. Along the bottom of the banner will be a tab bar in which the various options are shown. The user can click on an of the tabs and the banner image will change and give a brief Call To Action in a box that overlays the image. Within this call to action, there will be a link which will lead to a page with more information about that particular option that they viewed.p  pA very good example of this is a hrefhttpslocalstake.com relnofollowhttpslocalstake.coma. For all intents and purposes I am trying to replicate the banner from that site, with appropriate changes to match the content of our particular service.p  pAm I correct in assuming that this will be accomplished via JavaScript My experience with JavaScript is very limited. I only did something very briefly with it many, many years ago in high school for a class project.p  pIf anyone can provide a link to a tutorial or help me directly with this, it will be much appreciated. I would assume that it functions very similarly to an image rotator, albeit without the automatic transitions and only requiring a manual click to change the banner.p  pThanks in advance for any helpp

Negative 178 pOver the past months I have been developing a versatile realtime game engine, and I have learned a lot, but I still feel very naive when it comes to the application life cycle. Specifically, I am trying to implement an Activity which can be shuffled in to the background by the user, then properly resumed.p  pMy current architecture is as such I have a an XML menu launcher activity which can create a realtime Game activity using intent. Relevant data in this Game activity is referenced through static data structures and variables. The Game activity creates worker threads in the onSurfaceCreate callback of my SurfaceView object.p  pWhen a user presses the back button, the activity is destroyed, and they are sent back to the XML menu in the launcher activity. Fine, good for now. When the user presses the home button, the Activity is sent to the background. OK, great. My problems arise when the user tries to find their way back in the Game activity once is has been sent to the background. When the user touches the launcher icon, the Game is destroyed and the menu is relaunched. Also, when the user resumes the game through the task manager, the onSurfaceCreate callback fires and the worker threads are started, but the game is frozen.p  pSo, I have two questions. First, how do I resume my activity through the launcher icon, instead of relaunching the game Second, when I resume my activity, what actions are necessary to restart my worker threads while persisting the game datap  pThanksp  pEDIT By request, I am including some code below. My onSurfaceCreate is a little bit complicated, it sends a message to another thread, which then implements the callback. I have verified that this implementation function fires when the Game activity is resumed.p  precodeprotected void surfaceCreate      Log.eTAG, surfaceCreate      Thread gameThread  createGameThread     gameThread.start    protected final void onResume      super.onResume      resume   protected final void onPause      super.onPause      pause  codepre  pThese cryptic pause and resume methods simply set a boolean variable which prevents some game logic from being executed, they do nothing to hinder the worker threads, which should continue looping.p  pEDIT Thanks Mohammad, for solving my first although smaller problem. It turns out that the launcher icon behaves differently when not connected by USB to the IDE. The second problem remains unresolved.p  pEDIT All working The second problem turned out to be an issue unique to my code, I apologize for that. I hope that this question can still be useful for those dealing with the launcher and IDEs.p

Negative 178 pI intend to use a hrefhttpsquirrellang.org relnofollowSquirrela as a scripting language for my C application. Naturally, there should be an API for interfacing with the C code for things such as accessing and modifying attributes in my C program. This API would consist of a bunch of classes, enums and functions.p  pWhile there are utilities like Sqrat that make binding single C functions to a Squirrel VM the matter of a single line of code, that is still not satifactory It would require me to create both the C classes with their functions to actually do all the interfacing work, and then Id have to maintain all the bindings to make those C functions known in my scripts as well. My intention is to remove this double maintenance overhead.p  pSo what I want is a tool that would simply take the already existing header file containing all my C classes and functions and generate API registration calls from this file. And while we are at it, of course it would be nice to automatically generate a documentation for every function as well doesnt matter if its HTML or just a Squirrel script that contains of function definitions  comments or whatever.p  pI know theres SWIG, but it doesnt have a binding Squirrel, and thats not exactly what I would be looking for anyway  after all, I need to create C wraper code, not Squirrel code. Ive seen a hrefhttpflex.sourceforge.net relnofollowFlexa, but Im not sure whether thats what Im looking for, either. So is there any tool that would do what I want automate the creation of wrapper code and API documentation from a CC header Otherwise, I guess I might have to write my own little C parser that can parse simple function and class definitions.p

Negative 178 pIm developing a windows 8 store app in c and xaml for a websitethe website is in .net mvc 4 .In the web site i can create, edit, and delete products im using sql server 2008 r2.

I wanted to know if there is a way to notify or update the data in the w8 app after someone create or edit a product through the website.

Negative 178 pI have to use the azure cache service in my node.js code and I am leveraging tomasz janczuks a hrefhttpsgithub.comtjanczukazurecache relnofollowazurecachea library. But I have encountered below error when connecting to cache servicep  pThe error says  There is a temporary failure. Please retry later. One or more specified cache servers are unavailable, which could be caused by busy network or servers. For onpremises cache clusters, also verify the following conditions. Ensure that security permission has been granted for this client account, and check that the AppFabric Caching Service is allowed through the firewall on all cache hosts. Also the MaxBufferSize on the server must be greater than or equal to the serialized object size sent from the client.. Additional Information  The client was trying to communicate with the serverp  pThis error doesnt happen in my .NET code where am also accessing the cache service but only throws up when i access the cache service from my node.js code. After looking on web i got to know that this might happen if there is a mismatch between versions of azure sdk and azure caching. But am using the latest versions of all SDKs. Am using Azure SDK for .NET 2.1, Azure caching 2.1 and the latest azure node.js sdk released on 22082013. Please let me know how i can resolve this issue.

Negative 178 pHope there are some neural network heads out here who can help with this p  pstrongBackgroundstrong Im using an accelerometer to draw shapes in the air, and Im wondering if its possible to use a neural network to detect what shape Ive drawn.p  pLets assume I have a predefined vocabulary of 3 possible shapes say, circle, oval, figure of eight. I draw many circles, collect the resultant accelerometer data, and preprocess it to produce a set S of N x,y,z vectors. The x, y, z are acceleration values.p  pFinally, I have a neural network with 3 boolean outputs circle, oval, fig8.p  pstrongMy questionstrong emWhat should my inputs beemp  pstrongOnly solution I can think ofstrong Have 3N inputs x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, ..., xN, yN, zN.p  pstrongMy concernstrong Such a solution doesnt tell the neural network that x1, y1, z1 are related to each other, that they have the same timestamp. From what I understand, the neural network should be given information about this relationship in some way. Is that necessary If yes, is it possible to do this in this specific case, and how Is a neural network completely the wrong solution for this problem of shapedetectionfromaccelerometerdatap
Negative 178 pLets say I have a code.Deferredcode and a codejqXHRcode object. Is there a way to transfer all the handlers bound to the deferred then, always, done, fail over to the XHR object which, as I understand it, is an extension of Deferredp  hr  pHeres what I had in mindp  precode.ajaxOne  functionoptions      var xhr  null     return function          ifxhr xhr.abort         xhr  .ajaxoptions.alwaysfunction              xhr  null                codepre  pI wanted to create a function, similar to code.ajaxcode, except that if you call it multiple times in rapid succession, it will abort the last request and only complete the most recent one. This is useful in many scenarios where you want to validate a users input. p  pFor example, you might want to check if a username is taken, but if they start typing in the username field again after youve started your ajax call, you dont care about the last result, only the most recent one. p  pAlso, I dont think requests are guaranteed to return in the same order they went out I suppose depending on your server setup, so you could have a syncing issue as well.p  pAnyway, the problem with the above code is that because it returns a function, you can execute your ajax call whenever you like, but you cant bind your completion handlers to it. So I have to somehow mix the deferred handlers in and rebind them to the XHR object.p

Negative 178 pI saw that SCTP is going to be used for Data Channels starting in Chrome 31, and officially RTP based channels are going to be deprecated sometimes in February 2014 according to this google group threadp  pa hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicdiscusswebrtcy2A97iCByTU relnofollowhttpsgroups.google.comforumtopicdiscusswebrtcy2A97iCByTUap  pDoes this also mean that webrtc audio and video channels are also going to be transported over SCTP eventuallyif not already in the worksp  pHow does RTP fit in the whole SCTP transport effort Does that mean SRTP packets will flow over SCTP data channel Or perhaps just the payload will be sent over SCTP transport protocol.   p  pIf I am reading info on SCTP, it combines best of TCP and UDP protocols but it does not include encryption by default so in mind the traffic flowing over should still be encrypted.p  pAny additional info would be helpful.

Negative 178 pIn the greendao FAQs it says Starting from greenDAO theres limited support for String primary keys. a hrefhttpgreendaoorm.comdocumentationtechnicalfaqhttpgreendaoorm.comdocumentationtechnicalfaqap  pI cant find anywhere that says how to do this.p  pI am using Guids as my primary key in a server application, and want to be able to generate new data remotely from an android device and upload this back to the server. The database on the android device is in sqlite and uses greenDAO to generate POJOs and data access layer. I am using Guids to avoid primary key collisions when data is uploaded to the server. I am storing the Guids as strings. p  pThere is some more advice on the greendao website that says I should create a secondary field holding the string and still use the long primary key favoured by greendao, but this means that I have to reconnect all my database relationships when I import data from the server to the app which is a pain. Would much rather just continue to use the string primary keys if that is possible.p  pCan anybody tell me how to do thisp  pHere is some example code...p  pIn my generator Ive removed most of the fields for clarityp  precodeprivate static void addTablesSchema schema       Entity unit  addUnitschema          Entity forSale  addForSaleschema      Property unitIntId  forSale.addLongPropertyunitIntId.getProperty     forSale.addToOneunit, unitIntId    private static Entity addForSaleSchema schema       Entity thisEntity  schema.addEntityForSale     thisEntity.addIdProperty     thisEntity.addStringPropertyforSaleId             thisEntity.addFloatPropertycurrentPriceSqFt             thisEntity.addStringPropertyunitId     return thisEntity   private static Entity addUnitSchema schema       Entity thisEntity  schema.addEntityUnit     thisEntity.addIdProperty     thisEntity.addStringPropertyunitId     thisEntity.addStringPropertyname     return thisEntity  codepre  pIn my android application I download all the data from the server.

Is it necessary to have to create every new shape Also, what if I was to implement the Scanner class into the main class Lets say, the user can type in area values and command back information on subclass shapes and then do this with multiple values of area How would I go about doing that, as I have no idea how with having to create objects in the main class. We just started using the Main method our IDE for the class is BlueJ, which doesnt require it. I hope my question isnt too confusing with its wording and I apologize if I formatted this post wrong, as this is my first post. Thank you.p  pPS I forgot to mention to ignore that square is a rectangle. My professor made a mistake and by accidentally instructed us to extend rectangle from square. p  pPS besides in the main class, where you guys suggested adding each different shape to a collection and then iterating over each and printing out attributes, do you guys have any other alternatives How would I do it with the Scanner class Because in the above situation, I have tl create all the objects. Im trying to get as much practice as possible with main class because Im severely lacking in it due to BlueJ. p

Negative 178 pIm attempting to submit a search request codeSEGQuerycode that will search a specific field based on what the user selects from the twitter bootstrap button dropdown codeSearchFieldcode.  The codeSearchFieldcode is saved in the query string and I have no issue in retrieving that.  However, when I attempt to post the codeSEGQuerycode, its not being posted into my Action Method and I have no idea why.  Im attempting to use the codeAjax.ActionLinkcode helper rather than a button because I want to be able to maintain the look of the twitter bootstrap dropdown button.  p  pAnother issue Im having is that even though the Action method is hit, it doesnt redirect to the codeSearchResultscode view like it should.p  pIs there something obvious Im doing wrong that is preventing my model data from posting correctlyp  pbViewbp  precodeusing Html.BeginFormSearchResults, SEG, FormMethod.Post  ltdiv classsegsearchgt     ltdiv classinputappendgt         Html.TextBoxForm gt m.SEGQuery, new class  inputlargeseg         ltdiv classbtngroupgt             ltbutton classbtn dropdowntoggle datatoggledropdowngt                 Search                 ltspan classcaretgtltspangt             ltbuttongt             ltul classdropdownmenugt                 ltligtAjax.ActionLinkCompany Name, SearchResults, new fieldId  1, new AjaxOptionsHttpMethod  POSTltligt                 ltligtAjax.ActionLinkFOM Code, SearchResults, new fieldId  2, new AjaxOptionsHttpMethod  POSTltligt             ltulgt         ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt  codepre

Negative 178 pI am currently, for fun, making a pong game however I am currently stuck trying to get the value of my boolean goingup to a true state via the w key press. I have the boolean going up in my render class ,as well a int x and int y, and is set to false. In this class i draw a square , with x as int x and y as int y. In another classFramemake.java i have a key listener set to my Jframe. In this class i have the keylistener listening for the w key press and release. Here is where my problem arises If the W key is pressed i want  it to change goingup to true and if its released i want it to change going up to false this works fine but the problem is in my render class i have setup a timer , this is then started in the graphics method not sure of the proper name. In the timers action performed i have set if going up is true i want it to print out going up is true render. Here is the problem even though going up is true because of the w key being pressed, the print is not printed onto the screen.

Negative 178 pIve got a little functionality in my Symfony2 project which just asks for amount of notices waiting for a user in db. It runs every 5 seconds and targets regular Symfony2 controller and action, which checks db. I think its a overkill to run full framework just for that, but I dont want to add any custom scripts, would love to stick to proper Symfony usage, but without dispatching everything just to get a one number from db. Any guesses p

Negative 178 pstrongemMy Problem I am Havingemstrongp  pI load the database page for one of my innoDB databases from within phpMyAdmin and it loads EXTREMELY slow.  Were talking like up to 5 minutes of load time.   This only happens on the MAIN page, meaning, when you view the database and the left sidebar that shows all the tables shows up. p  pAfter that initial load time, each individual table can be clicked on and load almost immediately.  But those tables are loaded in an iframe without reloading the left sidebar of database tables which is why they load so quickly.p  pAfter that initial load time, each individual table can be opened in a new tabwindow immediately, but doing it that way does not include the left sidebar of database tables, which I am sure is the reason they load so quickly.p  pstrongemWhat I Expect To Be Happeningemstrongp  pI expect to be able to load the main page of my innoDB database from within phpMyAdmin without it taking 5 minutes to load.p  pstrongemWhat Ive triedemstrong p  pIve had this issue for months and it drives me crazy every day.  Ive come to live with it actually.  I simply load that initial page immediately every day, and go do something else so i dont have to watch it, because it just makes me angry.  p  pI have my timeout set to about 15 minutes, so if I think its been longer than 10 minutes, I will open where it says localhost in a different tab, which brings me to the login screen, log back in, and then it brings me to the list of databases, which loads quickly.  This is because if I simply load that main page, then log in, it will bring me back to that index page and ill wait another 5 minutes for it to load.  Grr..p  pOK so, I Googled and Googled and found tons of suggestions about making innoDB not do row counts and stuff like that.  Ive tried all of them.  Nothing is working  p  pI found something called cfg[Server][IgnoreSomeISrows]  true which did not help whatsoever.  I dont even know what it did, but it didnt work, so I removed it, but I forgot to remove that part and so I just left it there.

Negative 178 pI am using an NSFetchedResultsController to load messages for different email accounts into a tableview and a collection view. Everything works great on iOS7, and everything works great everywhere in iOS6 EXCEPT when I use a combined OR predicate.p  pNow I know that an NSFetchedResultsController will return the same item twice if it matches multiple of these predicates. My problem is that the message entity ONLY MATCHES ONE OF THESE PREDICATES yet is being returned the same number of times as predicates. p  pSo for some reason the NSFetchedResultsController is saying these messages pass all the predicates, but only on iOS6. It is doing this for every single message from a particular email account, but not for messages from the other accounts.p  pIf I adjust the OR predicate to go off of ObjectIDs instead, unique results are returned. However my UI will no longer update properly as values are adjustedp  pFor the life of me I cant seem to figure out how on earth these entities are passing the predicates for other email accounts and folders.p  pMy predicate construction that results in duplicates is as follows.

Negative 178 pIm confused between two attributes of codeResourcecode annotation.p  pJava Documentations says  brstrongmappedName strong A product specific name that this resource should be mapped to. The name of this resource, as defined by the name element or defaulted, is a name that is local to the application component using the resource. Its a name in the JNDI javacompenv namespace. Many application servers provide a way to map these local names to names of resources known to the application server. This mapped name is often a global JNDI name, but may be a name of any form. brstronglookup strong The name of the resource that the reference points to. It can link to any compatible resource using the global JNDI names.p  blockquote   pMy Question is how to choose between strongmappedNamestrong and stronglookupstrong,    based on what criteriap blockquote

Negative 178 pOur application has the notion of a codePermissionAttributecode.

Negative 178 pIs there any way, in php, to submit automatically the user and pass to an HTTP authentication popup The HTTP authentication isnt my script, so I have no way of controlling it myself, but Id like to just be able to pass the authentication information automatically rather than having to enter the login manually. Possibly via a curl function or otherwise. Or, even if I need to go lower level for this, like c or commandbash script, that would also be okay.p

Negative 178 pIve just started learning SASS and I got the hang of it pretty quickly, however it feels like Im writing my placeholders in a bad fashion so I want to understand how to avoid abusing them before I proceed.p  pI figured that it would be smart to put a bunch of placeholders like Ive done belowp  precodemargins      margin margin     padding padding   border      border border lightgrey   positionRel      position relativePos  codepre  pSo that I get this outcome p  precodebody, infocontainer      margin 0     padding 0   container, infocontainer inputnthchild1      border 1px solid lightgrey   container, infocontainer      position relative  codepre  pBut it just seems really, really wrong to do it like this because theres gonna be a ton of placeholders in bigger projects. If I use mixins instead the attributes wont be shared.

Negative 178 pI am self hosting a WCF service in a Windows Service which has two endpoints. TCP one is attached to one interface implementation, and MSMQIntegration one is attached to another interface implementation.p  pI would like to build functionality that would allow me to suspend the MSMQ endpoint for a period of time so that it stops looking for messages on the queue, and then build another that would allow me to reenable it. I want to do this without out stopping the ServiceHost and not interfering with the TCP endpoint at all.p  pI have tried to remove the endpoint from codeServiceHost.Description.Endpointscode, but I cant add it back in later. I think maybe there can be something done with the codeChannelDispatchercode, but I am not real sure on what to do.p  pThe reason that I am not running two ServiceHosts is because the TCP interfaces method are there to report on the status and throughput of the MSMQ endpoint. Also in the future, I would like to add methods to the TCP interface that would allow an admin to dynamically configure the MSMQ endpoint on the fly, without shutting down and restarting the MSMQ endpoint. If the TCP ServiceHost is different than the MSMQ I am not sure how to keep variable scope for reporting and configuration.p  pSO..basically I am looking to suspend a listener, and not to shut it off and start it back up again. How can I achieve thisp

There are also other animations outside of the container going on at the same time.p  pIt works but the animations that start running at the loading time of Fragment are not smooth at all. p  ol liI thought it was due to the work of loading the fragment, so I triggered the animation at the end of onCreateView in the fragment, but still, the animation doesnt look good.li liIf I replace the fragment loading part with a ImageView, the animations are all very smooth.li ol  pWhat is happening here How can I make the animations go smoothlyp

Negative 178 pI am new to dot net MVC and I am working on a application which required Box integration, in which user authorizes our application using oauth2 authentication flow. I get the access token and refresh token and save them to my database for further offline access so that user do not have to authenticate the application again.p  pNow, I am using Box Windows SDK v2 to get list of files and folders of a user. Here is the code block by which I am able to get the rot folder of box.p  precodevar config  new BoxConfigclientId, clientSecret, new Urihttplocalhost49671CloudBoxCallback Pls note, here accessToken and refreshToken are fetched from database OAuthSession session  new OAuthSessionaccessToken, refreshToken, 3600, bearer BoxClient client  new BoxClientconfig, session BoxFolder boxFolder  client.FoldersManager.GetInformationAsync0.Result codepre  pEverything is fine upto this point.p  pNow when the access token expires as it is valid only for 3600 seconds, and I try to get the root folder again, Box SDK refreshes access token and refresh token automatically without telling me. and provides me the root folder object.p  pAt this moment I got the root folder, but I am not aware that Box SDK has updated the access token and refresh tokens. Still I have old access token and refresh token in my database. They are not updated. And I am lost. Now I am left with those old invalidated access token and refresh token.p  pPls help. How do I know that Box SDK has updated access token and refresh token  so that I can update them in my database for future use.p  pIt would be nice, if you can provide a working sample MVC application which stores the access token and refresh token. You can provide the code blocks which needs to be placed in controller. I hope, I will be able to integrate them.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 178 pI am using schedulework in an ISR to queue up work for backhalve processing.  My ISR adds an event to an array and then calls schedulework for each interrupt that I receive. p  pI read the comments on schedulework and it adds my callback function only once to the work queue.  If it is already on the workqueue it doesnt add it again. This means that if I quickly add multiple events to the queue from the ISR I need to loop in my backhalve to guarantee that I retrieve all of my events. p  pI dont want to hog the work queue by looping too much if I have too many events.  Can I call schedulework from within my callback function to be rescheduled later giving other work items in the queue a chance to execute  Is my callback function removed from the kernel global workqueue before the callback is called or when it returns If I call schedulework from within the callback will it add my work item to the end of the queuep  pThanks.p

The output of the first query is the input of the second one and so on and for this scenario the result is not more than 140 eventss. p  pNow I tested my application with a simple query, which outputs all events received from the input stream, and in this situation the server handles approximately 2000 eventss. I have some images with the results, but unfortunately I cannot put them yet.

Negative 178 pI have 2 forms in my program. Form1 has a tab control on it, and on one of these tabs there are a load of labels. Form2 has a few textboxes and dropdown lists on it. Form1 has a button on it that opens Form2 on top of it as a normal form, not as a dialog. p  pThere is code in Form1 that on loading populates the labels on it from a MySQL database. This code is in a separate public sub in the form that is called when the form loads.p  pWhat I am trying to do is fill in some of the boxes on Form2, when this Form closes it updates the database with these values Works fine and then those values are displayed on Form1. I can get Form2 to run the code in Form1 that populates the labels, but the problem is that the labels on Form1 never actually change. I have tried multiple things, including calling refresh on the labels, trying to change the labels from within Form2 instead of Form1, but they just never update. The .text value of the labels is being updated to the new value, I have checked this via debugging and stopping at the correct points to see what the value is.p  pAny ideas anyone I think it might be to do with the fact that its Form2 calling the code and for some reason it doesnt have access to change the labels on Form1.p  pCodep  pForm1 AECSurveyFormp  precodePrivate Sub AECSurveyLoadsender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles     MyBase.Load      LoadMeterData  End Sub   Public Sub LoadMeterData      Dim AECMeteringDataAdapter As New AECMeteringDataTableAdapter     Dim AECMeteringData As AECMeteringDataDataTable     AECMeteringData  AECMeteringDataAdapter.GetAECMeterDataBySurveyUniqueIdentifierAECGlobalValues.CurrentSurveyUniqueIdentifier      utility      Meter1UtilityLabel.Text  AECMeteringData0Utility1  End Sub  Private Sub MeterButton1Clicksender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles Meter1Button.Click      If Not Application.OpenForms.OfTypeOf AECMeteringDataForm.Any Then          AECMeteringDataForm.GetDataAECGlobalValues.CurrentSurveyUniqueIdentifier, 1          AECMeteringDataForm.Show      End If  End Sub codepre  pForm2 AECMeteringDataFormp  precodePrivate Sub AECMeteringDataFormFormClosingsender As Object, e As EventArgs Handles MyBase.Closing      Dim AECMeteringDataAdapter As New AECMeteringDataTableAdapter     Dim AECMeteringData As AECMeteringDataDataTable     AECMeteringData  AECMeteringDataAdapter.GetAECMeterDataBySurveyUniqueIdentifierAECGlobalValues.CurrentSurveyUniqueIdentifier      AECMeteringData0Utility1  UtilityComboBox.SelectedItem.ToString      AECMeteringDataAdapter.UpdateAECMeteringData      AECSurveyForm.LoadMeterData  End Sub codepre

Negative 178 pI am currently working on a client javaswing server tomcathibernatejaxws application that requires many database operations and should be able to execute longrunning background tasks on the serverside. I chose this setup mainly for a better code reuse.p  pHowever, there are some issues that, probably, many others have also faced and found solutions forp  pOne of the biggest issues was lazyloading vs. jaxws. There were some viable solutions like overriding the jaxws accessors a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions22509921jaxwshibernatejaxbhowtoavoidlazyinitializationexceptionduringmarshJAXWS  Hibernate  JAXB How to avoid LazyInitializationException during marshallinga that solved this issue be replacing the hibernates proxies with null.p  pNow Im facing new problems described by this examplep  pAn entity customer is located within a country, thus n1 relationship.p  pThe country within the customer is marked as lazyloaded to avoid unnecessary database traffic. When the client UI wants to list customers the country is not needed here, the countryproxy is replaced by null within the jaxws accessor and everything is fine. When editing a customer, however, I think I must join the country, even when not viewingchanging it. Otherwise its proxy would be replaced by null when sent to the client via jaxws, then sent back to the server, and committed with null into the database. Hereafter my customercountry association is lost.p  pMaybe there are several solutions likep  ul limarking the country as optionalfalse triggering an exception when I forgot to join the country beforehand and then try to save the customer. Using this approach I must always join all references even when they are not part of the editing process. References requiring optionaltrue would pass silently and coding mistakes might destroy the database.li linot replacing the proxy by null within the jaxws accessor, but some other dummy class that, when sent back from the client to the server, is replaced by the original proxy. But Im not sure whether this is feasible at all.li liuse hibernate within the client and connect directly to the database, using jaxws only for nondatabase interactionli liwrite some code to allow lazyloading within the client when necessary by sending corresponding jaxws requests couldnt find the StackOverflow link anymore where someone asked for something like this. Totally feels like reinventing hibernate...li ul  pAre there any other solutions, recommendations, bestpractices, better setups for this kind of applicationp  pThx in advancep

Negative 178 pI am in the process of making an EFMVC application which utilizes OAuth2Owin for third party logins in addition to local user creation. Some of these third parties have APIs allowing you to further personalize the experience by retrieving data specific to that user with some data based on their returned ID. p  pFor instance, Ive integrated a Steam Oneclick login, and using the returned 64bit user ID which is part of the ProviderKey stored after successful authentication, I can then start pulling information about that user and start usingdisplaying that data to help streamline or otherwise enhance the application.p  pMy question is how I can retrieve this information that is being stored. using the default user authentication functionality. Ive located exactly what Im looking for, which is p  precode    UserLoginInfo     This is an extension of      Microsoft.AspNet.Identity codepre  pIt is a sealed class which holds a LoginProvider and Providerkey the latter is prize Im seeking. These are stored with a foreign key of sorts representing the User ID.p  pThis may be a terribly amateur question, but how can I obtain information from this UserLoginInfo classp  pFor reference, here is a quick article on how this is set up a hrefhttpwww.asp.netmvcoverviewsecuritycreateanaspnetmvc5appwithfacebookandgoogleoauth2andopenidsignon relnofollowhttpwww.asp.netmvcoverviewsecuritycreateanaspnetmvc5appwithfacebookandgoogleoauth2andopenidsignona ...in the event youre not familiar with what Im babbling about.p  pI sincerely appreciate any guidance on this that can be provided. If Ive been unclear at all please let me know so I can explain better.p  pCheersp  pEdit 6415  Another example, since this is fairly specific and hasnt yielded a single reply, would be the user token for Twitter, Google, or Facebook, all of which are included in the default Thirdparty login of the MVC 4.5 EF Authentication platform.  p  pIf you use the default connection string when creating the database context, a separate datastore is created which will hold user logins, claims, roles, etc. Specifically, the UserLogins will hold this information, with each user having the ability to have all of their accounts associated to a profile UserID for emmyem website, i.e. there will be an entry for each of these social media sites with a common UserID. p  pSince the prebuilt Authorization libraries used for much of this functionality are sealed, I realize there are some barriers. Im trying to find an elegant way of retrieving this emoneem piece of information for each of my users so that I can have more engaging content, but searching the web I have found emveryem little information relating to this subject which is not terribly surprising considering the age of this code and functionality. Does anyone know of a resource that might aid in tracking down how to make a customized version of the user management that might allow for a more direct control of the user informationp
Negative 178 pWe run a Django app via WSGI and use Tornado as singlethread app for the websocket part of this project. During the livetime more and more clients connect to Tornado and establish a websocket connection with the help of SockJS. Then some times later we got an incoming function call or request that tells Tornado that in Django an object in the database has somehow changed. Tornado is up to fetch the new data from the database or a cache and sends these data to all clients. Because every client may have different permissions Tornado can not fetch data once and send it out. It has to do multiple fetches in any way to get different data for different clients. How should it do thisp  pWe thougth about three solutions but we are not sure which is best.p  pSolution 1 We use ThreadPoolExecutor or ProcessPoolExecutor which of them to open different threads, one for each client Tornado should inform later. These threads go ansynchronous inside the Django app and get the data from there. Here we can even use a cache if we want.p  pSolution 2 Same as solution 1 but we dont open multiple threads in Tornado but try to get the data via HTTP from another nonpublic WSGIServer so we save some time for otherwise required security checks.p  pSolution 3 Tornado goes directly inside the Django app but only tries to get the data from a cache. If the cache is not empty, Tornado does so for all other clients and sends the data out. If the cache is empty, Tornado aborts looping the clients and fires out an ansynchronous request via WSGI to tell Django to update the whole cache. When this is done, Tornado tries to get data from the cache again as it did before. May be we implement a counter that it give up after n tryings.p  pEsp. solution 3 is a favourite of some of our core devs, but others think this would be a misleading concept.p  pThanks to all.p

Negative 178 pI have the following problemp  pWe have a lot of different, yet similar types of data items that we want to record in a MariaDB database. All data items have some common parameters such as id, username, status, file glob, type, comments, start amp end time stamps. In addition there are many lets say between 40 and 100 parameters that are specific to each type of data item.p  pWe would prefer to have the different data item types in the same table because they will be displayed along with several other data, as they happen, in one single list in the web application. This will appear like an activity stream or Facebook wall. p  pIt seems that the normalised approach with a toplevel generic table joined with specific tables underneath will lead to bad performance. We will have to do both a lot of joins and unions in order to display the activity stream, and the application will frequently poll with this query, so its important that the query runs fast. p  pSo, which is the better solutions in terms of performance and storage optimizationp  ol lito utilize MariaDBs dynamic columnsli lito just add in all the different kinds of columns we need in one table, and just accept that each data item type will only use a few of the columns, i.e. the rest will be null.li lisomething elseli ol  pDoes it matter if we use regular columns when a lot of the data in them will be nullp  pWhen should we use dynamic columns and when is it better to use regular columns p

Negative 178 pIm implementing a cache simulator where the user can specify writeallocate or writenoallocate, writeback or writethrough, as well as other variables like associativity and block size. Rather than keep track of memory we just keep track of a the number of datainstruction accesses, misses, and replacements.p  pFor simpler test cases Im getting the correct results but this changes for larger trace files. The common mistake is that Im commonly registering too few misses and replacements by the same number, so apparently some times when it should be a missreplacement it interprets it as a hit. I was hoping someone could check my logic in regards to writeback vs writethrough and writeallocate vs writenoallocate. My init, search, insert, and delete methods are definitely correct Im sure of this but its my performAccess method thats killing me. Heres my pseudocode for instructionloads, where LRUhead is an array of cacheline heads for every set in the cache, where you can specify the set you care about with index.p  precodeIfINSTRUCTIONLOAD  instaccesess ifLRUhead[index]  NULL miss no replacement     instmisses     constructed  makeLinetag     insert constructed into set with correct index      else if search  false miss, maybe replacement     instmisses     constructedLine  makeLinetag     ifroominsetindex  true     insert constructed into set with correct index          else LRU line will be evicted to make room     instreplacements     delete an entry based on Least Recently Used     insert constructed into that now vacated spot           else hit     delete and insert it to make it most recently used element for LRU purposes       codepre  pWhat I want to clarify is whether writealloc vs writenoallocate should only affect missesreplacements for a datastore command, and writeback vs writethrough should only affect words copied back to memory when a cache is being flushed or when a line is being evicted to make room Im getting the correct number of accesses for both data and instruction commands but its the missesreplacements that are killing although I thought those should be very straightforward.p

However, if the torrent is using a different tracker, I would need to scrape its statistics from said tracker making requests to it, but that usually takes a few seconds for each torrent and obviously, I cant make the users wait that long to see the listing.p  pI made a script that scrapes the latest 90 torrents running in background, but Im afraid that its not enough. The website will grow up, and total torrents will probably be over 5000. I dont think scraping that many torrents in background will work.p  pHow can I do thisp

Negative 178 pI have the simple problem of comparing all elements to each other. The comparison itself is symmetric, therefore, it doesnt have to be done twice. p  pThe following code example shows what I am looking for by showing the indices of the accessed elementsp  precodeint n  5 for int i  0 i lt n i      for int j  i  1 j lt n j              printfd dn, i,j       codepre  pThe output isp  precode0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 1 2 1 3 1 4 2 3 2 4 3 4 codepre  pSo each element is compared to each other once. When I want to parallelize this code I have the problem that first I have to stick to dynamic scheduling because the calculation time of each iteration does vary to a huge extend AND I can not use collapse due to the fact that the nested iterations are indexdependant from the outer loop.p  pUsing codepragma omp parallel for scheduledynamic, 3code for the outer loop may lead to single core executions at the end whereas using this for the inner loop may lead to such executions within each iteration of the outer loop.p  pIs there a more sophisticated way of doingparallelizing thatp

Negative 178 pI had a strange error the other day at work. One of my developers was having an issue getting back an identity value from a SQL query using the following function. She queried the parent table and it returned an identity key of code32455code, then she used that key as the foreign key to return the child table, which kept returning 0. When we manually queried the SQL table, I noticed the Identity columns primary key had a value of code35335code. This lead me to think that the function below could not handle a value greater than code32767code. To get around this issue, I created a similar function but used long instead of int. From everything I read online it looks like int or int32 should have a maximum value of code2,147,483,647code. I cant figure out why this issue occurred according to the documentation I read. Here is the calling statementp  precodeInt32 intLeaseID  GetIntegerScalarWithTransactionobjConnection,     objTransaction, strSQLConnectionString, strSQLCommand codepre  pAnd here is the functionp  precode    public static int GetIntegerScalarWithTransactionSqlConnection objConnection, SqlTransaction objTransaction, string strSQLConnection, string strSQLCommand               httpwww.java2s.comCodeVBDatabaseADO.netSimpleTransactionCommitandRollBackSqlTransactionhascompleteditisnolongerusable.htm          httpstackoverflow.comquestions3650894howtogetareturnvaluefromastoredprocedureinvbnet         SqlCommand objCommand  new SqlCommand         Int32 intRetValue  0          try                      objCommand.Connection  objConnection             objCommand.CommandText  ProcLibrary.SQLDelimiterstrSQLCommand             objCommand.Transaction  objTransaction             intRetValue  objCommand.ExecuteNonQuery                  catch Exception ex                      ProcLibrary.WriteLogex.ToString, System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly.GetName.Name                   return intRetValue      codepre
