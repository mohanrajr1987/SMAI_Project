Positive 1018 pHeres a potential pattern that can check if an argument is a tablep  precodeint myfnluaState L    luaLchecktypeL, 1, LUATTABLE    .. do stuff with the table ..  codepre  pThis works whenever the first argument is a table. However, other Lua types support table lookups, such as a userdata, and in luajit, a cdata.p  pIs there a nice way to check if a table lookup, such as via codeluagetfieldcode, will succeed before I call it I mean without restricting the type to tables. Relatedly, are tables, userdata, and cdata the only types in luajit that support indexed lookupsp  pIm most interested in answers restricted to the Lua 5.1 C API because Im using LuaJIT which currently works with this version.p  pstrongClarificationstrongp  pThe advantage of the codeluaLcheckXXXcode functions is that, in one line, theyp  ul lithrow an informative, userfriendly error message if the type is wrong, andli liprovide a Cfriendly return value that can be used immediately.li ul  pIm looking for something similar for tables. I dont expect a Cfriendly hashtable return value, but I emdoem want the same quality of error message to the user if the argument in question is not indexable.p  pIm embracing the philosophy of duck typing. If I write a function that simply wants to index some keys from an argument, then I dont care if that argument is truly a table, or just a userdata that supports codeindexcode lookups. I want to accept either one.p

Positive 1018 pWere doing a game custom engine and we use LuaBridge, which uses a lua lib generated from Lua 5.3 source code not by us, we just downloaded It. Problem is our engine uses vectorcall to optimize vector and matrices calculations on RELEASE DEBUG uses cdecl.  LuaBridge works perfectly on DEBUG but, when we change to RELEASE, it doesnt compile due problems with lua.lib. So, we have solved this problem before with other libs by just recompiling it with vectorcall on VS2013 for x64. The problem is We cant compile Lua as static library and make it work. p  pThings We have already triedp  ol liDo a console x64 project with the Lua code and compile It as Lib. Lib generated is not valid.li liDo a Static Library project. Same result as 1li ol  pOne thig we have observed is that, every precompiled library avaible for download, is between 600 and 800kb. Our generated libraries are about 1190kb. We think that this is an indicator of something going wrong.p  pAny help will be very much apreciated.p  pSOLVED We finally used the .lib we downloaded, but we edited lua.h, lualib.h and luaxlib.h adding cdecl in front of the functions defines this forces the call to cdecl.

Positive 1018 pIm using a custom shared library from lua. To load this library I have the required by Lua function codeluaopenmylibcode.

Negative 1018 pI have a PHP script that uses the codesystemcode call to execute other potentially longrunning programs for interest NCBI BLAST, phrap, primer3 and other programs for doing DNA sequence analysis and assembly.p  pIm running under Windows XP, using the CLI version of PHP from a command prompt, or as a service. In either case I communicate with it via a queue of tasks in a database table.p  pUnder PHP4 when I hit kbdCtrlkbdkbdCkbd the script is stopped and any child process running at the time is also stopped. Under PHP5 when I hit kbdCtrlkbdkbdCkbd the script stops, but the child is left running.p  pSimilarly, when running the script as a service, stopping the service when running it with PHP4 stops the child, with PHP5 the child continues to run.p  pI have tried writing a minimal test application, and found the same behaviour. The test PHP script just uses system to execute a C program that just sleeps for 30 seconds and then waits for a key to be pressed.p  pI had a look at the source for PHP 4.4.9 and 5.2.6 but could see no differences in the system code that looked like they would cause this. I also had a quick look at the startup code for the CLI application and didnt see any differences in signal handling.p  pAny hints on what might have caused this, or a workaround, would be appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Im allowed to use a central sequencer.p  pThere seems to be two immediate approachesp  ol liwrite an efficient system, attaching a unique id to each multicasted message, having the sequencer multicast sequence numbers for the message ids it receives, and sending back and forth ACKs and NACKs.li liwrite an inefficient flooding system, where each multicaster simply resends each message it receives once unless it was sent by that particular multicaster.li ol  pIm allowed to use the second option, and am inclined to do so.p  pIm currently multicasting UDP messages which seems to be the only option, but that means that some messages might get lost. That means I have to be able to uniquely identify each sent UDP message, so that it can be resent according to 2.  Should I really generate unique numbers e.g. using the sender address and a counter and pack them into each and every UDP message sent How would I go about doing that  And how do I receive a single UDP message in Python, and not a stream of data i.e. codesocket.recvcodep

Negative 1018 pI am currently a student and trying to design a Visual C application to allow me to visually insert an oriented graph in order to create a text file with the graphs matrix. At this point I have created an onClick event to create nodes and have used the forms Paint  event to draw the nodes. I have also inserted the conditions to avoid nodes from overlapping.p  pI am currently working on creating the links between nodes. The problem that I have encountered is that the line that unites two nodes crosses another node. I consider that writing an algorithm to detect overlapping and calculate how much the line needs to arch in order to avoid that is too tedious in this situation.p  pTherefore I thought about creating a line that can be arched by the user by clicking and dragging it to the left or right, however I have had problems finding any tutorials on how to do this. So if anyone has ever had to introduce this kind of arching line in a project or has any idea where I could find some information about this I would deeply appreciate it.p  pMentionsp  ol liplease do not recommend any fancy graphics libraries for doing this, as I am not interested in installing 3rd party stuff for this program. The function I want to insert the code into is named something like form1onPaint, so I would like to keep it strictly to the C standard libraries.li liI know I said I am interested in arching a line through click and drag, however if someone could suggest another viable solution to this, such as a function that detects overlapping in onPaint events or anything else that could be of use to solve this it would be of great help.li ol

Negative 1018 pstrongBackgroundstrongbr  Weve created a client portal that selects desired data points from our database and outputs them as XML. The client has provided us with their desired format in the form of an XSLT stylesheet. So our deliverable to them is preferably the most userfriendly format possible, preferably a PDF.  Our service is in Perl, so weve tried a variety of methods within various CPAN perl modules, and also used Apache FOP with an external Java service to go straight from XMLXSL to PDF, but its a nightmare for our IT team to replicate in production, and the results are less than stellar visually.p  pstrongStatusstrongbr  Were trying to use xmlsofts xsltproc to convert the XMLXSL into HTML and then either deliver that or convert it into a PDF, but our problem so far is that its outputting deprecated HTML thats causing problems with style and presentation in all cases.

Negative 1018 pUnit and integration testing is usually performed as part of a development process, of course. Im looking for ways to use this methodology in emconfigurationem of an existing system, in this case the a hrefhttpwww.asterisk.orgAsterisk soft PBXa.p  pIn the case of Asterisk, the configuration file is as much a programming language as anything else, complete with loops, jumps, conditionals, etc., and can get quite complex. Changes to the configuration often suffers from the same problems as changes to a complex software product  it can be hard to foresee all the effects without tests in place. Its made worse by the fact that the nature of the system is to communicate with external entities, i.e. make phone calls.p  pI have a few ideas about testing the system using call files to create specific calls between extensions while watching the manager interface for generated events. A test could then watch for an expected result, i.e. dialling 99 should result in the Voicemail application getting called.p  pThe flaws are obvious  it doesnt test the actual result, only what the system emthinksem is the result, and it probably requires some modification of the system under test. Its also really hard to write these tests robustly enough to only trigger on the expected output, especially if the system is in use i.e. there are other calls in progress.p  pIs what I want, a testing system for Asterisk, impossible If not, do you have any ideas about ways to go about this in a reasonable manner Im willing to put a fair amount of development time into this and release the result under a friendly license, but Im unsure about the best way to approach it.p

So, I created a class Rubyp  precodeclass Product   attraccessor name, price   def initializename, price     name  name     price  price   end end codepre  pwhich can be instantiated by doing IRbp  precodex  Product.newBanana Pro, 250 codepre  pBecause I want my virtual customers being able to purchase more than one product, or various configurations, I figured out I needed some kind of Order mechanism.p  precodeclass Order    def initializeorderno     orderno  orderno     lineitems  []   end     def addproductmyproduct     lineitems ltlt myproduct   end    def showorder     puts orderno     lineitems.each do x      puts x.name.tos  t  x.price.tos     end    end end  codepre  pthat can be instantiated by doing IRbp  precode   z  Order.new1234    z.addproductx    z.showorder codepre  pSplendid, I have now a very simple ordering system that allows me to add products to an order. But, here comes my real question.p  pWhat if I have three models of my product economy, business, showoff Or have my products be composed out of separate units bigger screen, nicer keyboard, different OS Surely I could make them three separate products, or add complexity to my product class, but I am looking for are best practices to design a flexible product object that can be used in the real world, to facilitate a complex system.p  pMy apologies if my grammar and my spelling are with error, as english is not my first language and I took the time to check as far I could understand and translate properly p  pThank you for your answers, comments and feedbackp

Negative 1018 pIm writing an application that manages todo lists. Unlike traditional todo list applications I want users to have these todo list files sit on their filesystem and be visible instead of being magically hidden by the app. I want users to be able to email todo lists to each other and so on.

Negative 1018 pIm designing a set of web apps to track scientific laboratory data. Each laboratory has several members, each of whom will access both their own data and that of their laboratory as a whole. Many typical queries will thus be expected to return records of multiple members e.g. my mouse, joes mouse and sallys mouse.p  pI think I have the database fairly well normalized. Im now wondering how to ensure that users can efficiently access both their own data and their labs data set when it is mixed among hopefully a whole ton of records from other labs.p  pWhat Ive come up with so far is that most tables will end with two fields userid and labgroupid. The WHERE clause of any SELECT statement will include the appropriate reference to one of the id fields ...WHERE labroupidn... or ...WHERE useridn....p  pMy questions arep  ol lipIs this an approach that will scale to 106 or more recordspli lipIf so, whats the best way to use these fields in a query so that it most efficiently searches the relevant subset of the database e.g. Should the first step in querying be to create a temporary table containing just the labgroups data Or will indexing using some combination of the id, userid, and labroupid fields be sufficient at that scalepli ol  pI thank any responders very much in advance.p

Negative 1018 pFor my app, I have a fairly complex set of configuration options that user can pick from. Im currently using a PreferenceActivity as my user interface for these options and the options are stored using shared preferences. As an example of some of the settings I have to accommodatep  ul lipLists of pairs to select a background pattern, the user can select to use from 1 to 5 different shapes where each shape is a .png file and assign each shape an int color. For example, the user could pick an orange square, a green triangle and a red rectangle.pli lipHierarchical data one part of my app can be configured to use one of five modes. Each mode has a few associated unique settings e.g. one mode requires two integers to be chosen the other mode might require one boolean to be chosen.pli ul  pHowever, my feeling is PreferenceActivity doesnt work well with settings like the above becausep  ul liShared preferences cannot store lists.li liShared preferences cannot store hierarchical data.li liBoiling my preference interface down to e.g. individual preference buttons for configuring each color and using dependent preferences to disable preferences that arent applicable with the current mode is going to make for a messy and hard to use interface.li ul  pI could write my own Preference classes for configuring the lists, but I find these really laborious to implement compared to implementing a typical View and Ive still got to deal with the storage issues.p  pMy plan wasp  ul liJust implement a custom activity with a custom GUI. This gives me much more freedom for doing a nice interface for configuring the lists and I can do intelligent hiding of options that arent applicable to the current mode.li liStore all my settings in either an XML file or by serialising a Java object.

And problem is that, when I hover that title, I get some content, but plugin is not working. But I tested, if I hover this while page is loading, that marquee plugin is working.

Negative 1018 pI am still a little new to C but I am using Winforms and I have a DataGridView which is connected to a datasource and is being populated correctly.p  pI have also added a ComboBoxColumn at run time. This ComboBoxColumn is being connected to a datasource, the displaymember and valuemember are set, the headertext is set and then the column is added to the datagrid. The connection works just fine and when the user clicks the comboBox is populated as expected.p  pWhen a user completes a new row in the grid he will obviously select the item in the comboBox and then the whole row is updated to my database when done.p  pMy question is When this datagrid is opened again or redrawn it is populated due to the datasource property, but how do I get the comboBox cell to display the VALUE he selected originally instead of just a blank box. I know the code of getting the value from the DB and put in a value. The ideal would be if I could put that variable in the display of the comboBox. Keep in mind that the comboBox is still data bound so that the user could edit the value if he so wishes p  pI know that in a normal comboBox control I should just set the .Text property. But the DataGridViewComboBox does not have the same property.p  pHere is the code for the actual data connection and adding of the comboBoxColumnp  precode    public void AddComboBoxColumnDataGridView datagridName, DataTable table, string headerText, int columnIndex              DataGridViewComboBoxColumn column  new DataGridViewComboBoxColumn          GetDisplayAndValueMemberstable, headerText Calls method that gets the datasource, displaymember, valuemember depending on column          column.DataSource  tableRef sets datasource to table referenced by column         column.DisplayMember  displayMember sets displaymember         column.ValueMember  valueMember sets valuemember          column.HeaderText  headerText changes headertext to displayed text          if newColumnIndex  0             datagridName.Columns.Addcolumn added to end of datagrid         else                      datagridName.Columns.RemoveAtcolumnIndex             datagridName.Columns.InsertnewColumnIndex, column added in specific index if needed               codepre  pThis just shows the dataconnection of the drop down. Obviously there are many methods being used with a large amount of code. But this is not the problem as this works fine. I dont know how to go about the issue of actually showing a previously selected item as the text of the comboBoxp

Negative 1018 pHopefully I can articulate my question well enough to get some clear and usable feedback here. I have reports like paper reports in my .NET application that have data bound to them. Typically the reports are a combination of many data elements across several busniess entites that may not all relate through an Inheritance hierarcy, etc. This makes it difficult to get all the needed data placed together to bind to the report.p  pSo what I emhaveem done before are make Report classes with data elements specific to supporting the reports they are bound to, and on the back end might be tied to specially created Stored Procedures that bring this data back maybe several joins across many tables to get the emrightem data needed. So if I was to make an analogy to the database world, I am essentially denormailizing the data structure to get all of this data into a single class to make it easy to bind to the report.p  pHowever on the hard line OOP concepts and architecture design, one could say that a report is just another thing to bind data to, and its class should not be designed just to suit the needs of data binding. In this thought process, I would actually need to make my class design be able to create the relationships needed to get all of the data together properly to still be bound, but not create any emspecialem Report classes. I find this difficult to do sometimes. It is much easier to create these relationships in the back end stored procedures and then just output the resultset to be almost immediately bound to the report.p  pSo what is the emrightem way to solve this If I create these specialized report classes with really no behavior, am I introducing an antipattern like the Anemic Domain Modelp  pI could use some feedback, and please speak up if my question and scenarios did not make sense.

Negative 1018 pI have a problem with timezone offsets in Joda Time.

Further the string may have      a timezone. withOffsetParsed makes the parser to respect the set timezone if one is set     DATETIMEPARSER  new DateTimeFormatterBuilder.appenddhmsFormatter                 .appendOptionaltimezoneFormatter.getParser.toFormatter.withOffsetParsed       Here a printer is created that prints this dateTime in the form yyyyMMdd ZZ     DATETIMEPRINTER  new DateTimeFormatterBuilder.appenddhmsFormatter.appendtimezoneFormatter.getPrinter.toFormatter codepre  pThis works as expected when I parse and print dates that have an offset set. E.g.p  ul li200611110900li li200412010000li ul  pThose two values are parsed and printed as they are written above here.p  pNow my question I want to be able to set a default time zone i.e. default offset when none is set. Ill do that like this codeDateTimeZone.setDefaultDateTimeZone.forIDEtcGMT1codep  pMy expectation is now that code20061111code is parsed and printed as code200611110100code, but in fact it prints code200611110100code.p  pI think this is somehow correct because here a hrefhttpwww.joda.orgjodatimetimezones.html relnofollowhttpwww.joda.orgjodatimetimezones.htmla it is written that EtcGMT1 has the standard offset of 0100. So whats wrong I want to offset to reflect the GMToffset. I also think that my values above are wrong means code200611110900code is not the timezone of Japan but it is the timezone of USAlaska.p  pI hope my problem is clear.

Negative 1018 pSorry if my question does not match the title, but i think it does I have an app with a navigation controller and 3 views. Its an app where you connect to a server and talk with friends. The thing is, my rootViewController, the login screen, calls the second view witch is the friends list. clicking in a friend on the list takes you to the third view, the chat screen itself. I wanted to, when the user logs in rootview, to store the user name used in a variable, so i could use it on the third view, the chat screen, so when he sends a message it can have his name on it, and while retrieving info from server, i can use his name as a parameter too. By the way, is SQLite the best way to save messages and users I am afraid of Core Data p

Negative 1018 pI want to profile synchronization operations, such as locking and unlocking of mutexes, semaphores etc. in Linux. p  pI know that deep down they are implemented using futexes, so maybe it is enough to profile locking and unlocking of futexes please correct me if Im wrong here. So my question is how to profile it, since futex operations normally occur in user space. Is their any tool which allow me to profile this p  pI am basically interested in knowing the functions which lock the futexes and the frequency.p

Negative 1018 pIm just getting started with Python, and am trying to figure out the Right Way to use classes. p  pMy program currently has two classes, call them codePlannercode and codeModelcode. The codePlannercode is modelagnostic, given that any codeModelcode it uses presents a consistent interface. So, it seems like if I want to have several different available models, they should all inherit from emsomethingem, in order to enforce the consistent interface. Additionally, some of the Model classes will share functionality. For example, a singleAgent Model might simulate one agent, while a doubleAgent Model would simulate two agents, each behaving just like the singleAgent.p  pSo  how should I implement this  what language features do I needp  pEDIT Thanks for the fast responses straightening me out about duck classes So, it sounds like I would only use inheritance if I wanted to override a subset of another codeModelcodes functionality And for my doubleAgent, Id probably just use singleAgents as class membersp  psub Ive taken a look through a few other questions with similar tags, but they seem to be more concerned with syntax rather than design choices. Ive also looked at the official Python documentation on a hrefhttpdocs.python.orgtutorialclasses.html relnofollowclassesa and not found what Im looking for. Possibly because I dont know enough to recognize it. subp

Negative 1018 pstrongFor background, heres my scenariostrongp  pIm building a selfhosted platform for a particular niche, and part of that platform is the login process, which if validated sets a session for the user. On every administration page load, the session is started and the variable codeSESSION[key]code checked to see if its true.p  pIf its false, the user is redirected to the login page with an error telling them to login again.p  pThe problem is this is dependant on a session cookie being set or not set, in the sense that when the session cookie expires and the session is started with codesessionstartcode to check codeSESSION[key]code, therefore creating a new session cookie with default values I use codesessionsetcookieparamscode to alter the path, timeout etc making it impossible to relogin as session cookies do not overwrite from what I can see.p  pIn order to fix this Ive thought about using something like codesessionsetcookieparams5, ..code before codesessionstartcode when checking codeSESSION[key]code, which will create a 5 second session cookie, therefore allowing a new one to be created when relogging in, but Im not sure whether this would work  and Im also sure there must be a more efficient way to setunset a session variablep  pstrongHeres my codestrongp  pStart session if validated loginp  precodeifvalidated     sessionsetcookieparams1800, inst, servername[home]      sessionnameinst     sessionstart     SESSION[key]  true  codepre  pCheck if SESSION[key] is still truep  precodesessionnameinst sessionstart  ifSESSION[key]      headerLocation  . server[home] . loginerror1  codepre  pAny answers or advice would be great, and please do ask if you need clarification on anythingp

Negative 1018 pNOTE Added important edit below to basically reask this question in a different wayp  pI know there are many different packages out there to put inside a delphi application for software intallation. I dont need anything fancy, I just need the ability to do some of the basic installation routines, such as proper installationreplacement of DLLs. I can do the majority of the installation manually, like copying files, saving registry settings, etc. I just need whatever it takes to make my installer properly register the new software with Windows or updated software. p  pIt would also be helpful if it can, for example, check if a file is currently being used before trying to replace it. Nothing visual is needed, there must be some sort of simple nonvisual component which can handle these common routines. And it should also be free opensource, if possible. I dont want to have to distribute a load of DLLs or other thirdparty files with my installer.p  pAny good suggestions Please dont answer with any huge complex fancy installer system. It just needs to be something simple to use directly in Delphi. It doesnt even have to be a component, even just a unit or library of units with some functions or such to help automate these common bits and pieces of installation.p  pADDED NOTE I already have an installer program made in delphi7, but would like something I can throw in my project which includes any type of assistance with the most common parts of installing software.p  hr  pstrongIMPORTANT EDITstrongp  pMy approach in asking this question I believe is wrong. Please allow me to reelaborate on this...p  pOur company already has a simple updater utility. Actually, this is not an Installer, but an Updater program. it simply replaces a few EXE files, executes SQL statements MSSQL server, writes some registry entries, etc...p  pThese are the issues I face with how this program is currently workingp  ul liUpon attempting to replace a DLL, the DLL might be in use, and therefore 90 of the time fails to replace the DLL. I need something that can check if the DLL is in use and if possible either forcefully replace the DLL anyway, or tell Windows to replace the DLL on the next restart.li liThe EXE name is Setup.exe which Windows 7 automatically recognizes it as an installer and thinks that it failed to install. I know there are workarounds for this, in fact, I saw a question here at stackoverflow recently for this exact case. Id like to see if theres already something ready with whatever it is I get which can take care of this, instead of me doing the work manually.li liThis is a serverclient system Im working with. IF the installation is on the server, it also needs to update replace the service EXE. I know how to startstop services, but have a lot of difficulties in waiting for the service to stop, then replace the file, then start it again. Id like to see if this can be automated.li liExecuting a large SQL script I mean over 25,000 lines in this script is hell, and doesnt work half the time. It includes many instances of GO which cannot be recognized by standard components, such as ADO. I can use a batch file to execute this, but thats getting a little dirtier than Im comfortable with. There must be a way to execute such a script without the use of batch files  especially reading the result and trying to identify if there were any errors in the update.li liThis updater is also going to install another thirdparty installation, specifically emSQL Native Client Driversem. Id like something that is already ready to launch another installer and wait for the result of it success or failure. If it fails, I need to know to continue the updater differently.li ul  pI can understand how its difficult to understand what Im asking for. I dont need a solution that can be used for anything and everything thrown at it. This is for this one software, nothing else. I know there probably isnt one single solution to cover all of the above, but any help would be great.p

The two in the middle point just off North, again 180 out.p  pAs you can see there are also a couple of errors triggered with the low latitudes close the equatorp  pI believe the fault is in this section, with the error being triggered at the third line starting with codeelccode.p  precode   Azimuth and elevation   el lt asinsindec  sinlat  cosdec  coslat  cosha   az lt asincosdec  sinha  cosel   elc lt asinsindec  sinlat   az[el gt elc] lt pi  az[el gt elc]   az[el lt elc amp ha gt 0] lt az[el lt elc amp ha gt 0]  twopi codepre  pI googled around and found a similar chunk of code in C, converted to R the line it uses to calculate the azimuth would be something likep  precodeaz lt atansinha  cosha  sinlat  tandec  coslat codepre  pThe output here seems to be heading in the right direction, but I just cant get it to give me the right answer all the time when its converted back to degrees.p  pA correction of the code suspect its just the few lines above to make it calculate the correct azimuth would be fantastic.p
Negative 1018 pI am doing an snmpget using NetSNMP.  Specifically I am sending a command via os.popenetc.  The value returned is a Hexstring separated by spaces, something like this  A0 f0 D0.  The returned value comes sometimes in the form HexString A0 f0 D0.. but sometimes comes in the form StringxA0xf0xD0 where, as you can see, the spaces are filled with x.  Does anyone have an idea as to why this might be happening  I would prefer it if the returned value was the HEXString with spaces, not x.p  pI should note that I am using Eclipse with Pydev.  I then ran the same code in pyscripter and got back my HexString value.  I ran it again in Pyscripter and then the xs returned.  Is this something to do with an unclosed pipep  pI should also mention that the data I am getting back is bad in another sense.  The HexString with spaces returns proper data values, but the String with xs returns values that are not correct.p  pI have used Wireshark and it looks like the get request is exactly the same as one sent from the MIB.  The MIB request returns the correct data, while the Eclipse request still returns bad data.p

Negative 1018 pI have a few function objects that have no member variables. The function objects are very simple in nature. They all inherit from codeunaryfunctionltgtcode or codebinaryfunctionltgtcode. For example, a couple of the function objects may be something like thisp  precodestruct keytohashmethod1  public binaryfunctionltint, int, intgt    int operator int a, int b const   do something     template lttypename keytohashmethodgt struct hashshrinkmethod1  public binaryfunctionltint, int, intgt, public keytohashmethod    int operator int a, int b const   do something while utilizing keytohashmethod      and more variations of these function objects  codepre  pA template class uses these function objects by taking them as template parameters as policies. The template class then inherits from themp  precodetemplate lttypename hashmethodgt class foo  public hashmethod   public  do something while using hashmethod as well as using the information provided by binaryfunctionltgt to selective compile different functions  codepre  pOf course, in the interest of keeping the example simple, the above may not make much sense as far as usefulness goes. p  pWhy am I inheriting instead of using composition Simply to avoid the empty classes from taking up space. Whether the space saved is minuscule or not is not the point of the question. p  pAs you can see from the above code, codebinaryfunctionltint, int, intgtcode will be inherited twice, which gives rise to the warning in VC 2008p  precodeWarning 1   warning C4584 hashshrinkmethod1ltkeytohashmethodgt  baseclass stdbinaryfunctionltArg1,Arg2,Resultgt is already a baseclass of keytohashmethod1    cvisual studio 2008projectsdefaulttemplateargumentsmain.cpp    12 codepre  pNow generally, in multiple inheritance, this is solved by virtual inheritance which I want to avoid in this case. What can I do in this situation to remove the warning p  pMy immediate solution is to not inherit from codebinaryfunctionltgtcode since I am assuming that codekeytohashmethodcode will be a codebinaryfunctioncode. This solution feels a bit like a programmer who does not have access to include guards or codepragma oncecode statement.

Negative 1018 pI have developed a Silverlight application. It has a button and once it is clicked the application starts doing something which takes time. Since everything in Silverlight is asynchronous the UI is not lagging, however, I would like to add some animation to it or something else to indicate that the application is actually doing some work and that the user should wait. p  pI dont know how to implement this, neither thread nor XAML wise. What is the best approach to this Thanks.p
Negative 1018 pI know there are a lots of samples unig region manages and interaction request triggers to show dialogs using prism, WPF and MVVM. in my situation I have different modules. For example I have module which creates organization units and assigns executive person to newly created unit. this view needs to be shown in standard dialog window with returned object of Model type which is OrganizationUnit object in this case. after showing view in modal window it has an textbox input here executive person name is entered and in case no matching person found it needs to open another dialog window which creates person and returns created object to already opened dialog window. I have seen all examples of using dialogs in MVVM as well as using popup region behavior and interactionrequesttrigger in PRISM. I do not get much out of using custom control to show popup as all I need is standard showdialog method which can be called from any viewmodel with callback specified.p  pthe way I want to achieve this is to have interactionrequesttriger in my shell and initial call to open popup dialog is performed on this trigger. to not to make this all very complicated I want some centralized way of showing dialogs and within dialogs showing other dialogs and all this with callbacks. could someone point me to the right directionp  pBy The way I want to have single control DialogView which will have ContentControl where viewmodels inject their views and buttons placeholder which holds buttons Ok, Cancel, Apply and want to bind have them bind to loaded viewmodels commands.p  pI know all this sounds a little bit complicated and complex but there might be solution for this. please someone give me ideas of how to accomplish this taskp

Negative 1018 pFor an experiment training study with human subjects, Im trying to record pen position on at tablet PC Thinkpad X61t, Windows 7 at a constant and high e.g., 100 Hz sampling rate. Unfortunately we are currently getting only variable sampling intervals 1516ms, with some considerably longer outliers  probably related to the screens refresh rate plus some measurement noise. Our programmer had managed to get constant sampling rates 100Hz on a previous setup X60t, Windows 7, but cant seem to get that to work on the current system the identical EXEFile produces constant vs variable output on the two systems.

Negative 1018 pIm having a problem with a PCI express board in the 32bit Windows 7 environment.  This board is an audovideo capture device that performs realtime H.264 encoding of 32 separate SD analog video channels.  It uses DMA to deliver compressed frames to the Win7 host driver.  p  pAt system bootup, the board driver allocates DMA buffers from the nonpaged pool using the AllocateCommonBuffer function of the DmaAdapter object.  The buffers must all reside in the same 256MB physical address range in order to be mapped to the board.  This allocation is always successful when the win7 host system boots.p  pThe board does not have any resident firmware other than a simple bootloader it requires the firmware image to be downloaded via the driver to the board at application runtime.  However, as part of this firmware download process, the windows application must issue a BOARDRESET ioctl through the driver to get the board into a known state.  Unfortunately, when the board receives the reset command, it briefly disappears from view of the win7 PnP manager, which thinks a SURPRISEREMOVAL event has occurred.  Subsequently, the board driver is forced to release all of its allocated DMA buffers back to the nonpaged pool, and wait for the StartDevice event from PnP manager.p  pWhen the next StartDevice event is received, the board driver cannot complete the DMA allocation anymore.  It is unable to find enough buffers from the nonpaged pool that can be mapped to the same physical address range, due to fragmentation.  The driver fails the StartDevice event and is then removed from service by PnP manager.p  pI am looking for a programmatic workaround for this situation.  Is it possible to suspend the device node somehow during board reset, so PnP manager does not detect it as a removal  Is there a PnP configuration that can override device removal detection  Is there any way to hang onto the DMA buffers that the driver successfully acquired the first time it started  Is there a way to reserve page ranges in the nonpaged pool for use by this driver only  The DMA buffers are rather large 200 buffers, each 634880 bytes, and they must all come from the same 256MB range i.e, on 0x10000000 boundaries. I have the complete source code for the board driver and can make any necessary modifications it is part of a purchased reference design from a vendor.  This is my first exposure to windows device drivers.  p
Negative 1018 pOk Im in a situation where I have the following tablesp  pUser UserId .... UserFavourite UserId, OtherUserId, AddDatep  pIf you favourite another user it adds a row into userFavourite. Now I have referential integrity between both UserId and OtherUserId columns and the User table with two foreign key constraints.p  pMy question is, what is the best practice for accessing this through NHibernate The basic Getlt method takes an id, which is the ID column. In this case the unique identifying characteristic of the table is a composite key of UserId and OtherUserId, so this leads me to think I should have a composite key. I read everywhere that they are bad though and if the DB is designed right I shouldnt be using them.p  pSo I thought of how else I could design the DB, and I suppose I could havep  pUserFavourite UniqueID, UserId, OtherUserId, AddDatep  pAnd make UniqueId the PK and ID for the Get method, and put a unique constraint on the UserIdOtherUserId columns. However this does not solve my problem, as when I want to delete the row through code or get it, I still need to pass the UniqueID, which I will not have access to. I want to be able to sayp  pRemove this user User Id 142 from your favourites. So I only have access to the UserId, and your own UserId, so somehow I need to be able to run an NHibernate query using those two IDs, not the unique ID.p  pCan someone point me in the direction of how this case should be handled in NHibernate via ideal practises so that I can easily and efficiently do these queries without using composite keysp

Negative 1018 pIm reading Raymond Smullyans To mock a Mockingbird. In the book there is a puzzle that goes like thisp  blockquote   pAny resemblance between the Seville of this story and the    famous Seville of Spain which in fact there isnt is purely    coincidental. In this mythical town of Seville, the male inhabitants wear wigs on those and only those days when they feel like it. No two inhabitants behave alike on all days that is, given any two male inhabitants, there is at least one day on which one of them wears a wig and the other doesnt.    Given any male inhabitants X and Y, inhabitant Y is said    to be a follower of X ifY wears a wig on all days that X does.    Also, given any inhabitants X, Y, and Z, inhabitant Z is said    to be a follower of X and Y if Z wears a wig on all days that    X and Y both do. p      pFive of the inhabitants are named Alfredo, Bernardo, Ben    ito, Roberto, and Ramano. The following facts are known    about them p      pFact 1.. Bernardo and Benito are opposite in their wigwear    ing habits that is, on any given day, one of them wears a wig    and the other one doesnt. p      pFact 2 Roberto and Ramano are likewise opposites. p      pFact 3 Ramano wears a wig on those and only those days    when Alfredo and Benito both wear one. p      pSeville has exactly one barber, and the following facts are    known about him p      pFact 4 Bernardo is a follower of Alfredo and the barber. p      pFact 5 Given any male inhabitant X, if Bernardo is a fol    lower of Alfredo and X, then the barber is a follower of X    alone. p      pAlfredo wears only black wigs Bernardo wears only white    wigs Benito wears only gray wigs Roberto wears only red    wigs and Ramano wears only brown wigs. p      pOne Easter morning, the barber was seen wearing a wig.    What color was he wearing p blockquote  pI figured out it would be fun to solve this in Prolog, but I got stuck rather earlyp  precodeisOpposite bernardo, benito   . isOpposite benito  , bernardo . isOpposite roberto , ramano   . isOpposite ramano  , roberto  .  wears alfredo , black . wears bernardo, white . wears benito  , gray  . wears roberto , red   . wears ramano  , brown .  whatWearsTheBarber WigColor     member Barber, [ alfredo, benito, bernardo, roberto, ramano ] ,   wears Barber, WigColor . codepre  pI dont know how to effectively encode that someone follows some other people and I dont know how to reason based on that information. Ive followed solutions of some other logical puzzles in Prolog, but I couldnt figure out solutions for this one.p  pstrongEDITstrong Heres the solution copied from Smulyans bookp  blockquote   pStep 1 First, we prove that Roberto is a follower of the    barber. p      pWell, consider any day on which the barber wears a wig.    Either Alfredo wears a wig on that day or he doesnt. Suppose    Alfredo does. Then Bernardo also wears a wig on that day,    because Bernardo is a follower of Alfredo and the barber. So    Benito cant wear a wig on that day, because he is opposite    to Bernardo. Then Ramano cant wear a wig on that day,    because he wears wigs only on those days when Alfredo and    Benito both do, and Benito doesnt have one on this day. Since    Ramano doesnt wear a wig on this day, then Roberto must,    because Roberto is opposite to Ramano. This proves that on    any day on which the barber wears a wig, if Alfredo also does,    then so does Roberto. p      pNow, what about a day on which the barber wears a wig    but Alfredo doesnt Well, since Alfredo doesnt, then it cer    tainly is not the case that Alfredo and Benito both do hence    Ramano doesnt, by Fact 3, and therefore Roberto does, by    Fact 2. So Roberto wears a wig on any day that the barber    does and Alfredo doesntindeed, he wears a wig on all days    that Alfredo doesnt, regardless of the barber.    This proves that on any day on which the barber wears a    wig, Roberto also does, regardless of whether Alfredo does    or does not wear a wig on that day. So Roberto is indeed a    follower of the barber. p blockquote

The script is basically a fancy drillmenu using a list and a dropdown function.

The main reason for this, is that I am using a drilldown menu, while I should be using a chained selection menu.p  pBut I wouldnt post here if i wouldnt prefer the drillmenu. It keeps the process very intuitive and simple for future visitors and only needs one selectbox instead of multiple.p  pIn the script, the user drills down trough 4 categories, all containing several options.

So far example, a user goes trough this listp  pemGender 2 options  Age  3 options  Education 3 options  Category 6 options  List of questionsemp  pBut it doesnt matter if the user selects male or female, low, medium, high, etc. The questions remain the same. And since its a list I have a gigantic list of over 10.000 lines.p  pIdeal would be, if the content of especially the last list, will be loaded whenever it gets selected and not when the page loads.

Or perhaps there is an option to just add something to the list,  Or perhaps you guys know a similar script with the function already built in.p  pThe list is built in a PHP function.

Negative 1018 pstrongWhat is a good way to find all of the references to an object in pythonstrongp  pThe reason I ask is that it looks like we have a memory leak. We are uploading image files to the server from a web browser. Each time we do this, the memory usage goes up on the server goes up proportionately to the size of the file that was just uploaded. This memory is never getting released by the python garbage collection, so Im thinking that there are probably stray references pointing to the image data that are not getting deleted or going out of scope, even at the end of each request.p  pI figure it would be nice to be able to ask python What references are still pointing to this memory so that I can figure out what is keeping the garbage collection from freeing it.p  pCurrently we are running Python and Django on a Heroku server. p  pAny suggestions and ideas are appreciated, thanks so much p

So, I noticed while browsing the jQuery source that the jQuery domeready event can be trigger using code.readycode. Then I thought, placing this simple execution script just before closing the body should trigger all the onDomReady listeners that where previoulsy attached. And yes, it works as expectedp  precode     ltscriptgt.readyltscriptgt ltbodygt codepre  pHere are two examples, this one measures the ms spent while waiting for DOMReadyp  pa hrefhttpjsbin.comaqifon10httpjsbin.comaqifon10ap  pAs you can see, the DOMReady trigger is very natively slow, the user has to wait for a whole 200300 milliseconds before the domready script kick in.p  pAnyway, if we place code.readycode just before closing the codeBODYcode tag we get thisp  pa hrefhttpjsbin.comaqifon16httpjsbin.comaqifon16ap  pSee the difference By triggering domready manually, we can cut off 100300 ms of execution delay. This is a major deal, because we can rely on jQuery to take care of DOM manipulations before we see them.p  pNow, to a question, I have never seen this being recommended or discussed before, but still it seems like a major performance issue. Everything is about optimizing the code itself, which is good of course, but it is in vain if the execution is delayed for such a long time that the user sees a flash of unjQueryedContent.p  pAny ideas why this is not discussedrecommended more frequentlyp

Negative 1018 pIm rolling out an InHouse IOS App using the Enterprise development program. Im at a stage where I have a VC that allows the user to touch a button that downloads and installs the upgrade from inside the App.p  pIt works well. However, if the networks a little slow, the IOS prompted message thats thrown at the user Would you like to install, such and such... appears a little late. So, after the user has pressed the Install button, I disable it. However, if there user touches, Cancel when prompted by IOS, I do not know how to detect this.p  pIm using Xcode 4.5 and IOS6.0 on several devices iPhone 3, 4 and 5.p  pWithout giving the entire link away, the code that does the download is as follows. p  precode voidactionSheetUIActionSheet modalView clickedButtonAtIndexNSIntegerbuttonIndex   if buttonIndex  0       [self.IBOInstallActivityInd startAnimating]     [self enableInstallButtonNO]     self.tabBarController.tabBar.userInteractionEnabled  NO     [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL[NSURL URLWithStringAPPINSTALLFROM]]          actionSheetclickedButtonAtIndex codepre  pAnd, as Ive said, is good  it works. But if the user touches Cancel to the prompt, I want to be able to tell. As you can see, Im locking the user interface down. you might ask why, if an App is about to close and receive its upgrade. p  pWell, depending on network speed, I want to proven the user from hitting the button more than once. But, if the user cancels, I want to be in a position where I can reinitiate the user interface, enable tab bar etc...p  pIve crawled the Web, found nothing And, I guess the answer is probs on the Apple site, as good as it is. But, it takes a damned lot of reading.p  pHas anyone got any ideas at all p
Negative 1018 pI need to develop a Course Timetabling software which can allot timeslots and rooms efficiently. This is a curriculum based routine, not postenrollment based. And efficiently means classes are assigned timeslots according to staff time preferences and also need to minimize 1st year2nd year class overlap so that 2nd year students can retake the courses theyve failed to pass.and also for 3rd4th yr pair.p  pNow, at first i thought that would be an easy problem, but now it seems different. Most of the papers ive looked on uses Genetic AlgorithmPSOSimulated Annealing or these type of algorithm. And im still unable to interpret the problem to a GA problem. what im confused about is why almost none of them suggests DFS or Graphcoloring algorithmp  pCan someone explain the scenario if DFSgraphcoloring is used Or why they arent suggested or tried.p

Negative 1018 pIm having an issue with back faces to the light and shadow mapping that I cant seem to get past. Im still at the relatively early stages of optimizing my engine, however I cant seem to get there as even with everything handtuned for this one piece of geometry it still looks like garbage.p  pWhat it is is a skinny wall that is curved via about 5 different chunks of wall. When I create my depth map Im culling front faces to the light. This definitely helps, but the front faces on the other side of the wall are what seem to be causing the zfightingprojective shadowing.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.combYVDl.png altArtifacts on bent wallp  pSome notes on the screenshotp  ul liFront faces are culled when the depth texture from the light is being drawnli liI have the near and far planes tuned just for this chunk of geometry set at 20 and 25 respectivelyli liOne directional light source, coming down on a slight angle toward the right side of the scene, enough to indicate that wall should be shadowed, but mostly straight downli liUsing a ludicrously large 4096x4096 shadow map texture li liAll lighting is disabled, but know that I am doing soft lighting and hence vertex normals for the vertices even on this wallli ul  pAs mentioned a hrefhttpgamedev.stackexchange.comquestions29948firsttimeshadowmappingproblemsherea it concludes you should not shadow polygons that are back faced from the light. Im struggling with this particular issue because I dont want to pass the face normals all the way through to the fragment shader to rule out the true back faces to the light there  however if anyone feels this is the bestonly solution for this geometry thats what Ill have to do. Considering how the pipeline doesnt make it easyobvious to pass the face normals through it makes me feel like this isnt the path of least resistance. And note that the normals I am passing are the vertex normals, to allow for softer lighting effects around the edges will likely include both nonshadowed and shadowed surfaces.p  pNote that I am having some nasty a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopee41632428vvs.8529.aspxPerspective Aliasinga, but Im hoping my next steps are to work on a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsdesktopee41630728vvs.8529.aspxcascaded shadow mapsa, but without fixing this I feel like Im just delaying the inevitable as Ive handtightened the view as best I can or so I think.p  pAnyways I feel like Im missing something, so if you have any thoughts or help at all would be most appreciatedp  pEDITp  pTo be clear, the wall technically should NOT be in shadow, based on where the light is coming from. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comnS1qq.png altOverhead viewp  pBelow is an image with shadowing turned off. This is just using the vertex normals to calculate diffuse lighting  its not pretty too much geometry is visible but it does show that some of the edges are somewhat visible.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comkcFeV.png altWithout shadowing turned onp  pSo yes, the wall SHOULD be in shadow, but Im hoping I can get the smoothing working better so the edges can have some diffuse lighting. If I need to have it completely in shadow, then if its the shadow map that puts it in shadow, or my code specifically putting it in shadow because the face normal is away, Im fine with that  but passing the face normal through to my vertexfragment shader does not seem like the path of least resistance.p  pPerhaps these will help illustrate my problem better, or perhaps bring to light some fundamental understanding I am missing.p  pEDIT 2p  pIve included the depth texture below. You can see the wall in question in the bottom left, and from the screenshot you can see how ive trimmed the depth values to 0.41. This means the depth values of that wall start in the 0.4 range. So its not PERFECTLY clipped for it, but its close. Does that seem reasonable Im pretty sure its a full 24 or 32 bit depth buffer, a la DEPTHCOMPONENT extension on iOS. For starmole, does this help to determine if its a scaling error in my projection Do you think the sizearea covered of my map is too large, hence if it focuses closer it might helpp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqwBI4.png altenter image description herep

Negative 1018 pI am new to both YCSB and ElasticSearch. I was able to run YCSB easily for Cassandra. However, I have not been able to do the same with ES or perhaps I have but I am not sure.p  pFollowing the steps documented in YCSBelasticsearch, I was able to start the test and I even got the results. I am not sure on which ES instance is it running on For Cassandra, I had to start the Cassandra Server myself and then run the tests providing the hosts details along with the ycsb command. ES, on the other hand, does not require us to do anything of that sort. So how does YCSB run these tests. I didnt even have my local ES instance up but the tests gave results.p  pAny insights would really helpp  pThanksp
Negative 1018 pI need to reliably detect if a device has full internet access, i.e. that the user is not confined to a emcaptive portalem also called emwalled gardenem, i.e. a limited subnet which forces users to submit their credentials on a form in order to get full access. p  pMy app is automating the authentication process, and therefore it is important to know that full internet access is not available before starting the logon activity. p  pThe question is emnotem about how to check that the network interface is up and in a connected state.

Negative 1018 pIm building an OTP application which follows a pattern similar to one described on a hrefhttpwww.trapexit.orgBuildingNonBlockingErlangapps relnofollowtrapexita, where I implement a nonblocking genserver using codegenservercall3code to initiate a transaction with a backend and store a mapping of transaction id to the codeFromcode pid. When the genserver receives a message from the backend, it extracts the transaction id and uses this mapping to look up the correct pid, which it forwards the message to.p  pIn the trapexit example, this mapping is implemented using ets, however I found that having the genservers state contain a dict with these mappings to be a very natural solution.p  pFor my particular use case the mapping will contain, at most, 200 entries.p  pWhich implementation is recommendedp  pThanks in advancep
Negative 1018 pI have been working on a C Websocket Server for some time now and there has been one issue that I have worked around but never resolved or found a proper reason for its existence.p  pMy environments that I have tested have been using Googles Chrome browser over the series of versions over the past year or so on Windows XP and Windows 7. My server has been tested on both OS as well.p  pThe problem I notice only occurs when the browser is running under Windows XP. Upon completion of the Websocket Handshake, the browserclient cannot send data to the server unless a message is sent from the server to the client first. p  pWhat I have done, is simply tagged on a Ping frame to the end of the server Handshake and all functions as expected. I have tested with other frames as well, so long as the server sends a message, the client will proceed as normal. p  pThe message from the server does not need to be instant either. If the client attempts to send a message, it can wait indefinitely. As soon as the server sends a message to the client, the client proceeds.p  pNow, I figured I was doing something incorrectly on my Websocket Server, but if this was the case, then why does everything work as expected when the browser is running under Windows 7. I do not need to send a message to the client before the client will release a message to the server.p  pAs a very basic example, here is server code that will never complete if Chrome connects from an XP machinep  precodebyte[] textPound  0x81, 0x01, 0x23  Socket server  new SocketAddressFamily.InterNetwork, SocketType.Stream, ProtocolType.IP IPEndPoint ip  new IPEndPointIPAddress.Any, 56100 server.Bindip server.Listen100  byte[] buffer  new byte[1000]  Socket client  server.Accept int rec  client.Receivebuffer Handshakebuffer, ref reccustom function returns the handshake to the buffer client.Sendbuffer, rec, SocketFlags.None  client.SendtextPound rec  client.Receiveb client.Close codepre  pSo long as the .Send is commented out .Receive will never complete if Chrome is ran from an XP machine, no matter how you send a message from the browser. If you were to start a thread before .Receive that would issue a .Send after x amount of time, the process completes once that happens.p  pHas anyone experienced this, or know why this may bep  pstrongEDITstrong  For those who do not know what the WebSocket Protocol isp  pa hrefhttptools.ietf.orghtmlrfc6455 relnofollowProtocol Documentationap  pa hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTR2011WDwebsockets20110419 relnofollowAPI Documentationap

Negative 1018 pFrom what Ive read about Numpy arrays, theyre more memory efficient that standard Python lists. What confuses me is that when you create a numpy array, you have to pass in a python list. I assume this python list gets deconstructed, but to me, it seems like it defeats the purpose of having a memory efficient data structure if you have to create a larger inefficient structure to create the efficient one. p  pDoes numpy.zeros get around thisp

Here is to approaches. 1 Make validation with Spring Validator implement interface 2Use JSR303 on  domain model.p  pFirst approach looks more nicer  like I can use messages to render errors on any languages and can do more complex logic.

Negative 1018 pIm in the process of porting a C library to WinRT. It uses Winsock. Winsock isnt supported in WinRT. Microsoft directs you to use Windows.Networking.Sockets instead.

Also, WSAGetLastError returns the error status for the last Windows Sockets operation that failed, where SocketError.GetStatushresult requires an hresult as input, presumably from exception handling of a specific attempted operation.

Negative 1018 pSo Im still getting the hang of CakePHP, and Ive been working on a site that includes multiple polls for people to vote on. p  pBasically I have a table called entries which are the subjects people vote on. Entries has a field called votevalue which is an integer that can store both positive and negative values. People vote on these entries, either  or  and the entrys vote value is then affected.p  pstrongThe problemstrong Im not sure what the proper method of modifying the votevalue field would be. Theres an up and down arrow that the people see on the index of entries, and Id like that to refresh the page or eventually just reload the votevalue without refresh with that entrys new vote value. p  pI had thought about making a method that modifies the votevalue field in the model, but I believe thats hardcore breaking the point of MVC. Do I have to create another action in my controller just for this p  pAny help is appreciatedp

Negative 1018 pLet me clarify, this is kind of complicated.  Im implementing a form to insert data in the database. p  pI have two websockets connections in the same client side, connecting on the same nodejs server.p  pOne connection is triggered after the user inserts a name on the name textfield of the form. Sends the data to the server, server checks the database if the name already exists and responces back This already exists. Mayde you are inserting something that is already there.p  pThe other connection is triggered if all the fields of the form are not blank and sends the data to server to insert them in the database. p  pI thought it was a good idea to distinguish on serverside ,the different connections using arrays. If the first element of the array is name call the checkName function, or if it is insert , call the insertInDB function.p  pI created two small testing files. They do not work. Connections are open and the client sends the data. I get no errors inte server nor the client side. But server never responces. I dont get the expected numbers, back in the client side. I dont think this is the right anyway. This is complecated, I hope the code helps you.p  pIs it possible, what I am trying to do Any hints or alternativesp  pThanksp  pthe code.... serversidep  precodefunction WebSocketTest1  var a1  var b2  var c  [a,b]       var so  new WebSocketwslocalhost1337        so.onerrorfunction evt       message.textContent  evt       so.onopen  function       message.textContent  opened      so.sendc       message.textContent  sended              so.onmessage  function evt           var receivedmsg  evt.data        document.getElementByIdmessage.innerHTMLreceivedmsg         function WebSocketTest2  var d3  var e4  var f  [d,e]       var sa  new WebSocketwslocalhost1337        sa.onerrorfunction evt       message2.textContent  evt        sa.onopen  function      message2.textContent  opened      sa.sendf      message2.textContent  sended              sa.onmessage  function evt           var receivedmsg  evt.data          document.getElementByIdmessage2.innerHTMLreceivedmsg   ltscriptgt ltheadgt  ltinput typebutton valueone onClickWebSocketTest1gtltbrgt   ltinput typebutton valuetwo onClickWebSocketTest2gtltbrgt ltbodygt   ltdiv idmessagegtltdivgt mesage2ltbrgt     ltdiv idmessage2gtltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pon the server side I am listing the sessions, to communicate only with a specific session, code found a hrefhttpsgithub.comWorlizeWebSocketNodewikiHowto3aListallconnectedsessionsampCommunicatingwithaspecificsessiononly relnofollowherea  and the server side snippetsp  precode    var connections       var connectionIDCounter  0     var connection  request.acceptnull, request.origin      Store a reference to the connection using an incrementing ID     connection.id  connectionIDCounter      connections[connection.id]  connection       console.lognew Date   Connection accepted.     connection.onmessage, functionmessage                  var jamessage    ifja[0]1   ja[1]7            else ifja[0]3   ja[1]8             connection.onclose, functionreasonCode, description      console.lognew Date   Peer   connection.remoteAddress   disconnected.     delete connections[connection.id]            Send a message to a connection by its connectionID function sendToConnectionIdconnectionID, data      var connection  connections[connectionID]     if connection ampamp connection.connected          connection.sendja[1]         codepre

Negative 1018 pI often see in many mocking libraries for example methods where a generic type argument is used in place of an argument of type codeSystem.Typecode. I am specifically talking about cases where generic type is only being used in codetypeofTcode operation i.e. no instance of type T is being used anywhere within the method, and T is not being used for either return type or other arguments.p  pFor example consider following methodp  precodepublic string GetTypeNameSystem.Type type  return type.FullName  codepre  pthis method is often accompanied with a generic versionp  precodepublic string GetTypeNameltTgt  return GetTypeNametypeofT  codepre  pstrongQuestionsstrong  is it a bad practice or a good practicebr Is this a syntactic sugar or are there more to it    p  pI see this as misusing a language feature to abbreviate a call to a method that accepts an argument of type codeSystem.Typecodep  pWould you consider this a smell Should this be avoided or is this actually a good practice to provide a generic method as a shortcut to avoid typing codetypeofcode.p  pHere are some practical issues with using this pattern I can think of  p  ol liif an argument of non System.Type type is added  method emmightem need to be rewritten if order of arguments is semantically significant to non generic version otherwise some arguments will be generic type arguments, and some will be regular arguments.li liit requires two methods generic and non generic for cases where type is not known at compile time. Consequently adds unit tests which are mostly meaningless.li ol  pOn the other hand this is a common practice and majority is always right, right but more importantly ReSharper prefers that signature when I do Extract Method refactoring on a code that requires single argument of type System.Type known at compile time and I learned to take their recommendations though not on faith, but seriously.p

Negative 1018 pI have a very annoying problem with validating a column in a RadGrid.

Negative 1018 pI have about 50 projects in version control for which I am standardizing the way that they are structured and built.p  pEach has a build.xml in its root folder. We also have a project in which there is a build file that gets imported by the other projects in order to do common tasks. This makes maintenance of these common tasks much easier.p  pSVN Repositories for each project adhere to svn standard root structure of trunktagsbranches. Our workspaces are built in RAD by checking out from trunk. When rad then builds the project structure there is no actual trunk directory created on the filesystem. Projects simply begin in workspaceRootprojectName, without the trunk. Although the infomation about where the project was checked out from is in brackets after the project name, so you know what branch of the repository you are working on.p  pWe support both FileExport style war creation in RAD and explicit build.xml creation of the war file as well. All of this is working just peachy.p  pNow starting to get these projects building nightly in Jenkins and struggling with some of the file structure differences between the RAD environment and the Jenkins Environment.p  pFor instance, if I have a specific project I am working on, say project1, the build.xml location in my workspace will be p  precodeworkspaceRootproject1build.xml codepre  pThe common build.xml file similarly will be at p  precodeworkspaceRootcommonProjectbuild.xml codepre  pSo project1 will attempt to import that build file with p  precode ltimport filebasedir..commonProjectbuild.xmlgt codepre  pIn Jenkins however when I specify the repository location and it does its checkout it goes to p  precodejenkinsRootworkspacejobNameproject1trunkbuild.xml  codepre  pand similarly the common project build.xml is atp  precodejenkinsRootworkspacejobNamecommonProjecttrunkbuild.xml codepre  pSo the syntax in the project1 build file to import the common build file will not work. I have other similar issues, all related to differences in file structure.p  pIt seems this must be a fairly common issue, is there an best practice approach to addressing problems such as this. I have done a deal of searching around with no luck thus far.p  pWould be nice, for instance, if Jenkins could check out the trunk in the same way as RAD, but it does not seem that it can. This at least would allow me to use an ant available tag to look for the two possible trunk locations and use the correct one as appropriate. But one has a trunk and one does not. Jenkins includes the jobName in the workspace path, while obviously RAD has no such concept ... and so on. Would like a clean way of putting together a build process that works seamlessly whether launched from Rad or Jenkins.p  pJimp

Negative 1018 pAs a newbie, I am trying to understand how actors work. And, from the documentation, I think I understand that actors are objects which gets executed in sync mode and also that actor execution can contain blockingsync method calls, e.g. db requestsp  pBut, what I dont understand is that if you write an actor that has some blocking invocations inside like a blocking query execution, it will mess up the whole thread pool in the sense that cpu utilization will go down, etc., right  I mean, from my understanding, there is no way for JVM to understand whether it can switch that thread to someone else, ifwhen the actor makes a blocking call.p  pSo, given the nature of concurrency, shouldnt it be obvious that Actors should not be doing any blocking calls, ever p  pIf that is the case, what is the recommended way of doing a nonblockingasync call, lets say a web service call that fetches something and sends a message to another actor when that request is completed Should we simply use something like within the actorp  pfuture map  response  x  response.body  p  pIs this the proper way of handling thisp  pWould appreciate it if you can clarify this for me.p

Negative 1018 pIm pretty new here, but have a question that I would like some help with. Im studying machine learning and specifically Bayesian Networks. The problem I am trying to solve isp  pConsider a cow that might have a disease. You can detect this disease with a milk test that has a false positive rate of .05 and a false negative rate of .01. This test is done for 5 days in a row, with 5 outcomes. Given a set of outcomes, determine the state of the disease. Assume that the prior probability of an infection on day one is 0.001, and that the state of infection at a given day depends only on its state at the previous day, such that the probability that an infection would persist to the next day is .70, while the probability of a new infection is 0.002.p  pYour then given a set of outcomes and asked to determine some stuff based on those outcomes. Im not quite sure how to construct the network for this problem and was wondering if anyone had some pointers.p  pThanks.p

Negative 1018 pAssume that a large file is saved on disk and I want to run a computation on every chunk of data contained in the file.p  pThe CC code that I would write to do so would load part of the file, then do the processing, then load the next part, then do the processing of this next part, and so on.p  pIf I am, however, interested to do so in the shortest possible time, I could actually do the following First, tell DMAcontroller to load first part of the file. When this part is loaded tell the DMAcontroller to load the second part in some other part of the memory and then immediately start processing the first part.p  pIf I get an interrupt from the DMA during processing the first part, I finish the first part and afterwards tell the DMA to overwrite it with the third part of the file then I process the second part.p  pIf I do not get an interrupt from the DMA during processing the first part, I finish the first part and wait for the interrupt of the DMA.p  pDepending of how long the processing takes in relation to the diskread, this should be up to twice as fast. In reality, of course, one would have to measure. But that is not the question I am asking.p  pThe question is Is it possible to do this a in C using some nonstandard extension or b in assembly Or do operating systems not allow such things in general The question is meant primarily in a singlethread context, although I also would be interested to know how to do it with two threads. Also, I am interested in specific code this is more of a theoretical question.p

Negative 1018 pIm working on an application that should be available to intranet users running under their own account Windows authentication. This is easily configured and works.p  pNow if users are not logged in to the domain because they are off site or on a device that is not logged in they should still be able to use the application, minus some personalized functionality.p  pSo to sum that up, this is what I would like to happenp  ol liUser opens the application. If windows credentials are available the browser sents them to IIS.li liIf the users credentials are recieved, the application runs under these credentials Ive got that covered.li liIf the users credentials are not recieved, the application runs under the IIS anonymous account and personalized functionality is turned off Ive got that covered as well.li ol  pWhat I cant get to work is to optionally send the credentials. If I turn on windows authentication, Ill be logged in, which is fine. However if I try to access the site without sending credentials Ill get a 401, which makes sense. So I turn on anonymous authentication and now credentials are never sent.p  pThis actually makes sense, because IIS never requests for authentication from the browser.

Negative 1018 pI am new to ObjectiveC and OpenGL, so please be patient.p  pIm building an app that is mainly based on a fullscreen 2D pixelbuffer that is filled and animated using mathematical formulas similar to fractals, mostly using sin, cos, atan etc.p  pI have already optimized sin and cos by using tables which gave quite an fps boost, however, while the framerate is cool in the Simulator on a Mac Mini around 30 fps, I get a totally ridiculous 5 fps on an actual device iPad Mini nonretina.p  pAs I see no further ways to optimize the pixel loops, would it be possible to implement the effects using, say, an OpenGL shader, and then just draw a fullscreen quad with a texture on itp  pAs I said, the effects are really simple and just iterate over all pixels in a nested xy loop and use basic math and trig functions. The way I blit to the screen is already optimal for the device while staying in nonOpenGL, and gives like a million FPS if I leave out the actual math.p  pThanksp

Negative 1018 pI just read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions492809whentouseimgvscssbackgroundimagethis entrya but I am still not quite sure about the reasoning for the choices. In particular, Id like to understand exactly emwhatem is meant by content and noncontentother images and emwhyem I should use img when I am adding content images to my site and backgroundimage when adding non content images. p  pHere is my understanding of content and noncontent imagep  pContent images are those images that are dynamically generated. For example, images of users that are displayed on their profile page and images that are uploaded to a photo gallery, a blog, etc.p  pNoncontent images are those nondynamic images that are part of the site design. Theyre baked in if you will. E.g. logos, image links, image buttons, etc.p  pIf my definitions are correct  and please tell me if theyre not  then it seems to me the reasoning for using each would be as follows although this isnt exactly apparent in the article linked to, hence my follow up questionp  ul lipNon content images tend to not change as much as content images. I.e. logos, button images, links with images, etc. tend to stay the same. Theyre only changed if the site owner decides to redesign the site. pli lipContent images, on the other hand, tend to change frequently. New images are uploaded often, users change their profile images and photo galleries, etc. pli ul  pSo because of the dynamic nature of content images, they need an img tag that can dynamically be modified by whatever tech stack the site is driven by. The not so frequently changing images dont need image tags. They can be loaded from the site design assets directly in the css file for performance and easy maintainability. p  pIs that about right or am I missing somethingp

Ive placed onBackPressed method at the bottom of MainActivity to be able to go back within this webview using back button. Everything works as I would like whilst interacting inside the webview. All links open within the webview amp pressing back button takes me back to previous webview history as required. When there is no more history in webview amp back button is pressed, nothing happens which again is ideal as I dont want the app to be exited. This then requires the user to tap the app icon to open navigation drawer amp choose another item in the menu.p  pstrongHere is where Im stuckstrong. When I choose another item fragment from navigation drawer, it gets displayed, but when I press back button the app closes with message Unfortunately, myapp has stopped. Am I missing some code or do I have to add onBackPressed code for each fragment More importantly, Im confused as to where the onBackPressed method should go. Should it only go in MainActivity or should it go in each FragmentActivity As it stands the only onBackPressed method I have is in MainActivity for webview which works, but may still be wrong practice. What code do I need for other fragments that when back button is pressed, it doesnt close app with the above message I mentioned and where should it gop  pAny help is much appreciatedp  pHere is Logcatp  precode1217 223403.957 DAndroidRuntime8477 Shutting down VM 1217 223403.957 Wdalvikvm8477 threadid1 thread exiting with uncaught exception group0x41288930 1217 223403.987 EAndroidRuntime8477 FATAL EXCEPTION main 1217 223403.987 EAndroidRuntime8477 java.lang.NullPointerException 1217 223403.987 EAndroidRuntime8477     at com.loui.automartdirectcars.MainActivity.onBackPressedMainActivity.java273 1217 223403.987 EAndroidRuntime8477     at android.app.Activity.onKeyUpActivity.java2145 1217 223403.987 EAndroidRuntime8477     at android.view.KeyEvent.dispatchKeyEvent.java2633 1217 223403.987 EAndroidRuntime8477     at android.app.Activity.dispatchKeyEventActivity.java2375 1217 223403.987 EAndroidRuntime8477     at com.android.internal.policy.impl.PhoneWindowDecorView.dispatchKeyEventPhoneWindow.java1865 1217 223403.987 EAndroidRuntime8477     at android.view.ViewRootImpl.deliverKeyEventPostImeViewRootImpl.java3701 1217 223403.987 EAndroidRuntime8477     at android.view.ViewRootImpl.handleImeFinishedEventViewRootImpl.java3651 1217 223403.987 EAndroidRuntime8477     at android.view.ViewRootImplViewRootHandler.handleMessageViewRootImpl.java2818 1217 223403.987 EAndroidRuntime8477     at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessageHandler.java99 1217 223403.987 EAndroidRuntime8477     at android.os.Looper.loopLooper.java137 1217 223403.987 EAndroidRuntime8477     at android.app.ActivityThread.mainActivityThread.java5195 1217 223403.987 EAndroidRuntime8477     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeNativeNative Method 1217 223403.987 EAndroidRuntime8477     at java.lang.reflect.Method.invokeMethod.java511 1217 223403.987 EAndroidRuntime8477     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInitMethodAndArgsCaller.runZygoteInit.java795 1217 223403.987 EAndroidRuntime8477     at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.mainZygoteInit.java562 1217 223403.987 EAndroidRuntime8477     at dalvik.system.NativeStart.mainNative Method codepre

That way, I overwrite the full state of a value in the black board using the comparison operators as identifiers. p  pI have no idea if its a well known pattern or idea or if its problematic on the long run. So far it have been very useful. It also feels like something that might be too smart, but I lack experience with this pattern to confirm that. It might be that I am abusing the use of comparison operators, but it feels that the semantic of these types is correct in my use.p  pI can provide a detailed example of my usage if necessary.p

Negative 1018 pIm trying to present a youtube playlist in a table using YouTube Data v3, where each video should be opened in fullscreen landscape when the user taps on the cell. How could I achieve itp  pFirst attemptp  peach table cell contains the title of the video and a small web view containing the iframe of the video in this scenario if the user taps on the thumbnail, as it is a web view, the video automatically plays in fullscreen. The problem in this case is that the entire cell is not tappable but only the thumbnail.p  pSecond attemptp  pthe cell contains an image with the thumbnail of the video no web view and the title. On the tap a new view controller with a fullscreen web view is pushed. The problem here is that there is an intermediate step that Id like to skip.p  pThe perfect result would be exactly what the YouTube app does in the video result list, when you tap on a cell, the video opens and automatically starts but differently from this case I need it to be opened in fullscreen.p  pThanks a lot for any hint, DANp

For example,  the implementation of a btree by one person is so different from another that it literally calls for a change of definition. Its gotten to the point where all these definitions just started to confuse the heck out of me. Is there a book for all the above tree data structures that can be considered the standard bible Some clarification will be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 1018 pPlease take the look at images that are attached ,  I want to design a simple game level , So I have created a plane geometry for the floor . by duplicating this plane and welding the instances , I can create a long corridor. Then I had downloaded a texture which is seamless and tile able , and it is 256x256 pixels which atlased in a 1024 x 1024 pixel texture at Left Top Corner , it means at coordinates of  code0,1,0,0.75,0.25,0.25,0.25,0.75code .p  pSo I had assigned a material with texture mentioned above to plane object and then with Unwrap UVW modifier , I had set the UVs of the plane exactly  exactly to match the 256x256 portion of the atlas texture. Please note that Atlas texture background is black . p  pSo when I weld the two duplicates of the floor , problem which is shown in the images below will occur p  pImage 1 p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comscV50.gif altenter image description herep  pImage 2 p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.complRo8.gif altenter image description herep  pIf you cannot see the images, I will tell you the problem. the problem is that , a black line which it has the color of the atlas texture background appears between two adjacent edges of the planes and makes them nonseamless. So how can I blend the edges seam to not show the texture background  p  pI dont want to scale down the faces a bit in UVW Modifier dialog , I want to keep it exactly at the coordinates that I had mentioned above.p

Negative 1018 pI want to twoway sync my Android apps sqlite database to a web app backed by a MySQL database. The web app is RESTful. Now I see two possible waysp  pstrong1. Sync directly to MySQL databasestrongp  pThis seems easiest, but it seems like the storage mechanism of the web service should be abstracted from the synching. Also it feels like a potential security leak, as the MySQL server will need to listen globally instead of on just one IP that of the web server. Just a gut feeling...p  pstrong2. Sync indirectly using web services APIstrongp  pI could also sync indirectly by PUTingPOSTingDELETEing to the web services URIs. This would nicely abstract the data storage mechanism from the sync and the database server would only need to listen on the web servers IP address. p  pBut I wouldnt be able to use transactions anymore when synching the db schema has bunch of foreign key relationships, and I cant see any way to deal with failed inserts from primary key collisions this way.p  pSo both have advantages and drawbacks. Which is the way to go How do professional products do this Or is there another way that I havent thought of p  pAny thoughts would be greatly appreciated p

So lets say if the coulumn has a data like thisp  precodelta hrefabcd etc etc gt asdf ltagt etc etc lta hrefefgh etc etc xyzgt  codepre  pthen I want to have this replaced asp  precodelta hrefabcd etc etc xyzgt asdf ltagt etc etc lta hrefefgh etc etc xyzgt codepre  pIf I dont use negative look ahead I end up inserting double xyz like this  asdf  etc etc p  pI am using p  precodeREGEXPREPLACEdatacolunm,lt[a][s][gt][href][gt]xyz.gt,1 xyz 3 codepre  pBut as negative lookahead is not supported or my reqex is not oracle compatible, I am not finding any matches. This works in Java though. Thanks againp
Negative 1018 pThe API documentation for Androids a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comreferenceandroidutilSparseIntArray.html relnofollowSparseIntArraya opens withp  blockquote   pSparseIntArrays map integers to integers.p blockquote  pIm curious, then, why it doesnt implement a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavautilMap.html relnofollowMapltInteger, Integergta.p  pIt seems to me that all that wouldve been required is a couple of different method names, a few trivial extra methods, and a bit of code to prohibit codenullcode keys and values... certainly nothing that an a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavautilEnumMap.html relnofollowEnumMapa doesnt handle with grace.

Negative 1018 pAs of now, if I have to store something from Android to the server, I make an HTTP request of a codeGETcode URL, with data in the form of parameter values. On the server side, I use PHP to extract the parameter values and store them in database.p  pSimilarly, if I want to get something from the server to Android, I post a JSON string on the webpage using PHP. Then I read it in Android using HTTP request, convert the string to JSON and then use the data.p  pThis method of PHPMySQLAndroidJSON is very easy but not secure. Suppose I want to store the score of player from my game in Android to the servers database, it is easy to execute some URL like codewww.example.comsavescore.phpplayerid123ampscore999code from Android. But anyone can update his score if he comes to know the php file name and names of parameters, by simply typing this URL in a browser.p  pSo what is the correct method of interacting with a server my server supports PHP but not Javap  pI have heard about RESTful and KSOAP2, but know nothing about them. Can you please explain them a bit in lay man language reading the proper definitions didnt help me What are these used forp  pWhat is the best way to send score to the server Any tutorial link would be great.p  pThanks.p  pstrongEdit 1strong I dont use proguard to obfuscate my code for several reasons. So anyone can reverse engineer the apk, look into the code, find the URL to update the score, write his own POST method and update his score. How can I stop this from happeningp

Negative 1018 pI am using MVC3, .NET4 and EF4.1p  pI have just noticed that queries can be slow the first time round, then speed up significantly there after ie 10x.

Is this correctp  pAlso should I consider upgrading from EF4.1 to say 5.

Negative 1018 pOften, when Im looking for information of how to set certain properties of controls Im using Visual Studio primarily, but this question does apply to any IDE, the examples I find normally involve programatically setting said properties.p  pHeres an example, using the DataGridView.DefaultCellStyle property on MSDN a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.forms.datagridview.defaultcellstyle28vvs.11029.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.forms.datagridview.defaultcellstylevvs.110.aspxap  pSo my question is is it better for a programmer to modify these properties by code, or is it better to use the IDE itself to change them via the properties pane I realize that doing it the latter way will result in autogenerated code anyway, but it will be somewhere else in relation to the main bulk of usergenerated code.p

Negative 1018 pIm working on the design of a program using Play framework for Java. Its a website that requires users to log in and it needs to prevent a user from logging into an account that is already logged in. p  pWhen a user logs in, the username is stored in the Cache using memcached. When the user logs out, the username is disacarded from the Cache. If a login attempt is made for a username that exists in the Cache, the login attempt is rejected. p  pFor example, a user logs in with the username joe. Someone from another computer attempts to log in with the username joe and it gets rejected because joe is already logged in.p  pSimple enough, except when a user closes their browser tab, then they are locked out because their username still exists in the Cache.p  pSo, using javascript, Ive captured the window.onbeforeunload event to redirect to a route that runs a Java method that clears the Cache. The problem is that window.onbeforeunload is fired when the user clicks a link or reloads the page. So, if the user reloads the page, they are logged out, or if they click on a link within the website, they are logged out. Is there a way to prevent that from happeningp  pstrongEditstrong I am using Security.Authenticated to ensure people cant access the website unless they have a session in their cookie. I have a BaseController that extends Controller and all of my controllers extend BaseController except the one that handles the login page, and the BaseController is annotated withp  precodeSecurity.AuthenticatedSecured.class codepre  pSecured ensures that when somebody tries to access the website, if they dont have a session, they are redirected to the login page. Once they log in, a cookie is created with the session and Secured will allow them to access the page.p

Negative 1018 pI am having issues with the inconsistent result when I retrieve data from the database. These are the two cases p  p1 There are times when it outputs the complete expected rows and sometimes its not complete. For example, there are really 5 rows in the database but there are times when this is retrieved from the search function of my system, it is only 3 and sometimes it returns the complete 5 rows. It will return the complete 5 rows for some time but after a while, it will return just the 3. The search button that triggers this retrieval is clicked just milliseconds after the first search. This seems to happen randomly. I am using the same search function on my system.p  p2 There are times when the data retrieved has the new values just saved, and sometimes it has the old values. Again, this seems to happen randomly.p  pIs this has anything to do with the cache Sometimes it gets from the cache but sometimes it gets from the actual database Or is it the mysqlconnector installedp  pThis is a GWTdeveloped system installed on a tomcat server.

Negative 1018 pSay I have some process calling file device operation like read. Before this read the process also called a syscalldefined by me, providing me with some information relevant to the readand possibly other future reads done by this process. What is the best way of achieving this sort of information flow in the kernel Is there any good way to store processspecific information other than making some pidindexed listp  pId like the syscall information stored in kernel to be inherited by children of that process too. Would it be possible to achieve that without somehow traversing the process childparent treeand that wouldnt give me the inheritance I want because after forking I dont want changes in parent to affect the childp

Negative 1018 pIm having a strange problem with my raycasts.p  pIve a soldier character with some capsule colliders on various body parts to have bodypart specific damage and they have a specific layer to only hit them. The character also has a character controller on the root. I currently use raycasts to grab whatever information I need on what the raycast hit.p  pFor some reason, the raycasts are reporting a collision on a completely different position from the collider it supposedly hits. It would say its hitting the LlegUpperCollider but the hit point is somewhere a bit above the character. The editor shows that the collider is where its supposed to be. They seem to translate and orient themselves correctly with the character animation as well.p  pHeres a screenshot img srchttpi.stack.imgur.com2tmYS.jpg alt.p  pIve circled the hit point and Ive drawn an arrow to where the collider actually is. p  pYoull see two lines.

In comes Docker. Wed like to automate this process.  Docker will work well for this, but I would like to automate the build so anyone on our team can do that.p  pPart of the process involves cloning some git repositories.p  pOne thing I could do is use a shell script to clone the repos locally and then copy them over to the image, but since there is a dockerfile that is suppose to automate stuff, it seems natural to put the directions in there.p  pThis is not a problem except supplying git credentials.p  pCurrently Im copying over my idrsa during the build process. The though is to copy it over, pull from the repo, and then remove my credentials. That should work fine except Dockerfile does not accept user input.p  pWhen I go to add my ssh key in the dockerfile, it wants my key password...docker just craps out as it cant take user input. p  pHow do I get around this and still automate the processp  pHere is a sample from the dockerfile.p  precodeFROM ubuntu14.04 MAINTAINER Senica Gonzalez ltsenicagmail.comgt RUN aptget y update RUN aptget y upgrade RUN aptget y install gitcore RUN aptget y install vagrant RUN mkdir home.ssh COPY idrsa home.sshidrsa RUN eval sshagent s sshadd home.sshidrsa sshadd l codepre

I am new to WCF service, so please bear with me, So here is the situation, I have an unmanaged c dll which has complex data types such as structs, unions also it has some user defined data types. What I need is to connect this unmanaged c from a wcf servicec. I have two options for this 1. marshaling the complex types of unmanaged c dll to c types. 2. creating another unmanaged c dll which accepts basic data types from my wcf service and it tries to map this basic data types to the complex datatypes in the present c dll.p  pI want to know which is a better solution also I want to know how I can accomplish the second option. please correct me if I am wrong.

Negative 1018 ptldr I want to create simple theme, based on 2 columns with just pictures, that fill the whole screen, like this  a hrefhttphalfway.precrafted.com relnofollowhttphalfway.precrafted.coma p  pHello.p  pI started learning htmlcss yesterday, because i want to create rather simple theme that would fit my needs.p  pHowever, it turned out to be harder than i thought, unfortunately.p  pI post only pictures, without any captions or tags. All i want is theme based on 2 grids, where whole screen is occupied with pictures except header on top. This is the best, almost exact example of what i want  a hrefhttphalfway.precrafted.com relnofollowhttphalfway.precrafted.comap  pHowever, the issue is that tumblr allows photoset with maximum width of 700px. This may be overriden with javascript  and i found such scripts, but it uses fixed values, so it wont really fit to any screen  just mine.p
Negative 1018 pIm working on MAC OS X  Qt 5.3 widget application and Ive run into a problem. I have codeQGraphicsViewcode containing scene with movable codeQGraphicsEllipseItemcode, but I dont know how to catch the end of a move event.p  pWhat Im trying to do is trigger a method every time the drag event of a point ends and if that is not possible then when it moves, but I dont know where to start or what to do. Id prefer not to make my own implementation of QGraphicsEllipseItem, but if its the only option Im probably going to need a hand with it.p  pThe problem is also I dont know where to listen to these events, I have a class that inserts the points into thw widget and generally serves as a codebehind for it and Id like to do the catching there since the method is accessible from there and gets specific data from it. Im completely at loss of what to do or how to do it. I dont want complete code, but Id appreciate an example, if you can with placement specified.p

Negative 1018 pI am currently building a C WebApi 2 application that I will be uploading to an Amazon Elastic Beanstalk instance to deploy. I am having success so far, and on my local machine, I just finished testing the file upload capability in order for clients to upload images.p  pThe way it goes is I accept the multipartformdata in the Web Api and save the temp file with a random name like BodyPart24e246c7a92a4a3d84efc1651416e667 to the AppData folder. The temporary file is put into an S3 Bucket and I create a reference in my SQL Server database to it. p  pTesting works fine with single or multiple file uploads locally but when I deploy the application to Elastic Beanstalk and try to upload I get errors like strongCould not find a part of the path CinetpubwwwrootsbeAPIdeployAppDataBodyPart8f552d48ed9b4ec2998688cbffd673eestrong or a similar one saying access is denied altogether. p  pI have been trying to find the solution online for a few hours now, but the AWS documentation is all over the place and tutorialsother questions seem to be outdated. I believe it has something to do with not having permission to write the temporary files on the EC2 server, but I cant figure out how to fix it.p  pThanks very much in advance.p

Negative 1018 pMy boss has a concern that creating LOB columns in our database tables could result in effectively permanent storage overhead if we do not partition the table and drop the partitions over time as opposed to just deleting the records.  He thinks that data for the LOB will be stored separately when the record is created, which seems to be correct, but that Oracle may not delete the data for the LOB column when the row is deleted.p  pIs this correct or even possible  I find it hard to believe that the DBMS would handle object storage so poorly.  We are using Oracle 11g if that changes anything.p

Negative 1018 pIm sure the answer to this is already out there just cant seem to find it. I have a SubView which I am dynamically in the the MainViewModel. This is then displayed to the user using a style. When I create a new instance of the SubViewModel the View is not recreated if it of the same type as it was before. This is an issue as the selected tab remains the same and is not reset to the first tab. Although I could just save the selected tab index in the ViewModel to reset it I feel it is purely View state and should not exist in the ViewModel.

Negative 1018 pI am using Eclipse to deploy my java apps to a Tomcat server.  This is an issue I have experienced for years, but I just havent take the time to look into it.  My apps use Spring  Struts  Hibernate.  When I deploy my apps, if there are any types of issues with my Spring or Hibernate config files my deployment will just hang for minutes 5  10 sometimes and then FINALLY quit deployment and give me the error that was causing the problems.p  pThere has to be a better way of getting the error messages that just sitting around waiting to find I misspelled a single word in some spring bean or something minor like that.  Then to make things even worse, I only get a single error and it more exist I have to go through this ridiculous process all over again until all the errors are fixed.p  pForce quitting deployment does just that, stops it but doesnt give any output to why it was taking so long.  I basically have to wait until TomcatEclipse decide to give up before I can do anything.p

Negative 1018 pI want to create a line of emnem processes  one master which tells others what to do and workers which do what they are asked to. The communication between them is by usage of pipes and looks like this sign  standa for pipe master  worker 1  worker 2  ...  worker np  pMy idea is to create children using fork in a loop and then putting all the prcesses except for the 1st one, which will be the master in an endless loop where they will be waiting for something to come up in a pipe.

Negative 1018 pSome backgroundp  pI have an i2c device MCP23017, which has 6 switches connected to its GPIO ports. The MCP23017 is connected to a Raspberry Pi via i2c.p  pIm able to read the state of each of the switches as required.p  pMy issue is in regards to interrupts. Im using the WiringPi2 library for Python, which allows me to interface with the MCP23017 under Python. From the research Ive done, the WiringPiISR library allows for i2c interrupt protocols to be run, although it only seems to work properly under C.p  pMy question is this is there a simple solution for implementing i2c interrupts under Pythonp  pIm considering dropping Python for C for this particular project, but the GUI interface has already been written in Python, so Id like to keep that as a last option.p  pAny guidanceinputcomments would be greatly appreciatedp  pThanksp

Negative 1018 pWe are looking into supporting a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiTLSPSK relnofollowTLSPSKa for a set of constrained devices that do not have sufficient resources to do the normal TLS handshake using certificates. To that end we are looking for a TLSPSK component that we can integrate on our cloud servers. This component may be anything, a proxy, module for apache or anything else that scales well.p  pSo far we have found several libraries that support TLSPSK GnuTLS, OpenSSL amongst others. Moreover, we can find several HTTPSTLS client libraries that we can use to send HTTPS requests over a TLSPSK connection. However, what we have not been able to find are serverside solutions that would accept such TLSPSK connections. Apache modules modssl, and modgnutls do not expose the TLSPSK capabilities of the underlying libraries. F5 BigIP has TLSPSK not in its cipher lists. HAProxy does not have TLSPSK interfaces as well. The node.js TLS library had a pullrequest that became stale and hard to apply with all the recent TLS lib refactorings...p  pSo in short does anyone know of a TLSPSK capable component that we can integrate in our server backends to accept TLSPSK connections from a large set of clientsp  pThanks, Joostp

Negative 1018 pI am running an Openfire server on a AWS EC2 instance and am able to connect to the server from my mobile devices and send messages back and forth. Of course, since XMPP is a clientserver based protocol, I incur costs for running this traffic over the AWS server. However, for most use cases, this cost is not very high at all, as normal XMPP stanzas rarely seem to go above ca. 1 KB, so from this end all is ok.p  pI would now, however, like to include the ability to send images from one client to another. One way would be to use an HTTP server, to which user A uploads the picture and then sends the URL of the image to user B via XMPP, so that the user can now get the image via HTTP. There are also several other methods for sending images via XMPP. However, I am interested in doing this via Jingle. p  pAs far as as I understand, Jingle is an out of band peertopeer extension to XMPP. My simple question is, since Jingle communicates peertopeer, i.e. without the use of a server, for the multimedia aspect of the session, will I even incur any data cost on AWS for transferring multimedia from one client to another using Jingle Or put differently, if Jingle is peertopeer, does any data go via my AWS server using Jingle except the session initiate, ack, session terminate stanzas If not, what kind of route does this data take, and how can anyone be billed for this traffic cost, if it is peertopeerp

Negative 1018 pIm working with Entity Framework 6 and ODP.NET, and am importing Stored Procedures into the applications data model. ODP.NET is unable to automatically import stored procedures that use InOut cursors, and requires that their information be added to the app.config by hand. Worse still, I have over thirty procedures to import, the majority of which make use of InOut cursors. Ive seen that its possible to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19218397functionimportsforentityframeworkwithodpnetmanageddrivergenerate config information automaticallya, but that only seems to work for functions that directly return cursors. And perhaps with Out cursors toop  pIs there an automated way to retrieve the column names and data types that a stored procedures cursor returns without manually running down all the information by handp  pAn example of how Im currently importing a procedure in my app.config, sanitized for public consumptionp  precodeltstoredProcedure schemaSCHEMA namePACKAGE.PROCEDURENAMEgt       ltrefCursor nameioCursorgt         ltbindInfo modeInputOutputgt         ltmetadata columnOrdinal0 columnNameSOMEID providerTypeInt32 allowDBNullfalse nativeDataTypeNumbergt                     ltmetadata columnOrdinal1 columnNameSOMEOTHERID providerTypeInt32 allowDBNullfalse nativeDataTypeNumbergt         ltmetadata columnOrdinal2 columnNameSOMESTRING providerTypeVarchar2 allowDBNullfalse nativeDataTypeVarchar2gt       ltrefCursorgt     ltstoredProceduregt codepre  pAnd how that same procedure appears in its packagep  precodePROCEDURE PROCEDURENAME      someInputId IN schema.table.columnTYPE     ,ioCursor IN OUT trefcur       IS  BEGIN     vProcedureName  PROCEDURENAME     OPEN ioCursor FOR SELECT a.someid SOMEID                             ,a.someotherid SOMEOTHERID                             ,b.somestring SOMESTRING                         FROM  schema.tablea a,                               schema.tableb b                         WHERE selection criteria removed for brevitys sake END codepre  pAs you can see, in order to properly fill in the metadata in my app.config, I need to run down the names and types of SOMEID, SOMEOTHERID and SOMESTRING, all three of which could possibly reside in different tables. Some way of pulling in this data automatically would be lovely.p  pEDITp  h2Solvedh2  pThanks to Christian Shays answer down below, I ultimately came up with some code that I was able to build a tool around. It does the exact same thing as ODP.NETs Run Stored Procedure in the Server Explorer, but it also works with InOut Ref Cursors Some psuedocode  is below, to show the basic idea of what I wound up doing.p  precodeusingContextItem context  new ContextItem      OracleCommand cmd  context.Database.Connection.CreateCommand as OracleCommand     cmd.CommandType  CommandType.StoredProcedure     cmd.CommandText  PROCEDURENAMEHERE      do the following for all of the input parameters for the stored proc     OracleDbType paramType  OracleDbType.SomeType     OracleParameter param  new OracleParameterparameterName, paramType     param.Value  someValue      or, for cursors     OracleDbType cursorType  OracleDbType.RefCursor     ParameterDirection direction  ParameterDirection.SomeCursorDirection     OracleParameter cursorParam  new OracleParametercursorName, OracleDbType.RefCursor, direction      cmd.Parameters.Addparam     cmd.Parameters.AddcursorParam     if db.Database.Connection.State  ConnectionState.Open               db.Database.Connection.Open            var reader  cmd.ExecuteReaderCommandBehavior.KeyInfo     var table  reader.GetSchemaTable      forint i  0 i lt reader.FieldCount i              Now you have access to everything you need for an EF config          Ordinals, column names, provider types, notnullness, and native data types        codepre

So putting in that generic relation is not really an option.p  pAside from A and B there is also App C. Its job is to combine AampB. It consists mostly of templates that override templates from A and inserts templatetags from B. p  pNow I wonder Is there a way to take a Model from A, load it in C and add the GenericRelation there without overriding the whole field list. This would allow me to keep A independent, but still get the performance boost.  Any ideas how to do thatp  pThank you very much for your time.p

Negative 1018 pLets say I have a website with 2 categories of users  users who selfregister to access content   customers who can build spaces, and invite users to these spacesp  pAs virtually anyone could be a customer and start inviting people, I dont want the customers to see the email addresses of the users in their space otherwise it would be easy to get email addresses of everyone.p  pBut these spaces may get big, and customers may want to animate the community using newsletters. However, since we dont want them to see the email addresses, Im left with 2 options  implement an emailing system, which is a very hard problem solved by services such as Mailchimp and that I dont really want to solve again by myself building emails using WYSIWYG, handling clientspecific stuff, analytics, unsub system, delivery measurement, etc  the one Id love find a way to integrate with one of those servicep  pIm not even sure if it makes sense, but Im wondering if there is any way to integrate with one of those services but never disclose email addresses. Essentially, imagine a Mailchimp integration where you have a list of contacts that you cant open and that is automatically pulled from my website, but that you can send a campaign to.p

Negative 1018 pI have two rays. Each ray has a start location vector Vector3D and a direction vector Vector3D, but continue on to infinity. They are both on the same plane, but in a 3D environment.

From this i need to calculate the location at which these rays intersect in the 3D environment and output it as a vector.

Negative 1018 pI imagine this is on the edge of what is considered a good question for this forum but I think its rather interesting and should hopefully yield some cool insight.  Essentially I have a perf problem. I have a code snippet here.p  pa hrefhttppastebin.com3WHB7V9G relnofollowhttppastebin.com3WHB7V9Gap  pI tried to document it well. Essentially all it does is make a HEAD request to a URL  it eventually redirects to youtube and it does, in this case it starts out as a redirector on youtube.com itself. Once it gets the final URL, it takes the video ID and uses youtube API to get some data. It doesnt even parse this data at the moment  its just the HttpClient requests.p  pTo me, this is simple  it should take lt 1 second. And subsequent requests often are. However if you do about one a minute you will find that the entire thing takes 3 seconds very often, and sometimes fails.  Worse, the simple HEAD request to the main youtube site often takes 23 seconds. I have tested this on 2 unrelated networks and found the same thing  feel free to validate me on this.p  pWhat am I missing here Are my expectations of performance unreasonable Is HTTPClient horrible at initiating connections Am I configuring something incorrectly  Any insight is much obliged.p

I have an abstract base class whose constructor calls a series of setters in a dispatch table based on an associative array of argument data, as followsp  precodeabstract class Base      protected static SETTERDISPATCHMODEL  array      public function constructarray data          foreach staticSETTERDISPATCHMODEL as dataKey gt method              if arraykeyexistsdataKey, data                  if methodexiststhis, method                      thisgtmethoddata[dataKey]                                  else                       Handle error                                              codepre  pWhat I would like to do is be able to define a method in my base class that builds the setter dispatch table by merging the subclass dispatch table with that of each of its parents, so I would be able to do thisp  precodeclass Foo extends Base      protected static SETTERDISPATCHMODEL  arrayfoo gt setFoo   class Bar extends Foo      protected static SETTERDISPATCHMODEL  arraybar gt setBar      The base constructor should call setFoo and setBar   class Baz extends Bar      protected static SETTERDISPATCHMODEL  arraybaz gt setBaz      The base constructor should call setFoo, setBar, and setBaz  codepre  pI cant figure out a way to define this behavior in the base class and make it take into account everything that happens all the way down the inheritance chain. The only way Ive been able to come up with to do what Im trying to do is to create a second property that contains the setters the class wishes to add to the model, and add this boilerplate constructor to each subclassp  precodepublic function constructarray data      if arraykeyexists         keyselfSUPPLEMENTALSETTERDISPATCHMODEL,         staticSETTERDISPATCHMODEL               staticSETTERDISPATCHMODEL  arraymerge             staticSETTERDISPATCHMODEL,             selfSUPPLEMENTALSETTERDISPATCHMODEL                   parentconstructdata  codepre  pThere has to be a better way to do this, rightp

Negative 1018 pI have an array of code10code numbers. They represent coordinates on a circle  in degrees, i.e. each number is in between code0code and code359.999999...codep  pThe problem I am trying to solve is that when I draw my items on the circle via html5 canvas api, sometimes they are clustered together and that results in items being drawn onto each other.p  pSo I would like to create an algorithm which disperses items evenly around their initial cluster position. Lets say and Id like this to be a configurable option the minimal distance between two items is code5code degrees. p  pSo  if the initial array is code[5, 41, 97, 101, 103, 158, 201, 214, 216, 217, 320]code then I would like the algorithm come up with something like [5, 41, strong95strong, strong100strong, strong105strong, 158, 201, strong211, 216, 221strong, 320] with bolded items being dispersed around their initial gravity center regardless whether those are 2 or more items.p  pAlso what would be neccessary is that the algorithm recognizes 0 and 359 being just 1 unit degree apart and also spread such items evenly around.p  pstrongHas anyone ever created such algorithm or have a good idea how it could be achievedstrong Even some general thoughts are welcome. Im sure I could achieve that with plenty of trial and error, but Id like to hear some educated guesses, if you will, first.p

Negative 1018 pI am trying to set up a website that will have a dropdown menu, and each option will direct you to a subset of the database.  For example, people in the state of Ohio, or the state of Michigan, etc.  I have some people who want to be pulled no matter what the state and there is a category called allstates.  Ive seen how I can add variables to the URL example  a hrefhttpwww.website.compage.htmOH1 relnofollowhttpwww.website.compage.htmOH1a  Ive also seen examples where two variables are set example a hrefhttpwww.website.compage.htmOH1ampallstates1 relnofollowhttpwww.website.compage.htmOH1ampallstates1a.  But how do I set it up so that only one condition needs to be met, effectively an OR instead of an AND  I want to be able to set up links to call data, for example, for those where Ohio is true OH1 OR allstates is true allstates1 because some people did not specify a particular state but will help in all states so I need to be able to pull in each list in one URL command.p

Negative 1018 pI am attempting to make a drawingpainting app using codeTextureViewcode on Android. I want to support a drawing surface of up to 4096x4096 pixels, which seems reasonable for my minimum target device which I use for testing which is a Google Nexus 7 2013 which has a nice quad core CPU and 2GB memory.p  pOne of my requirements is that my view must be inside of a view that allows it to be zoomed in and out and panned, which is all custom code I have written think UIScrollView from iOS.p  pIve tried using a regular View not codeTextureViewcode with OnDraw and performance was absolutely horrible  less than 1 frame a second. This happened even if I called codeInvalidaterectcode with only the rect that changed. I tried turning off hardware acceleration for the view, but nothing rendered, I assume because 4096x4096 is too big for software.p  pI then tried using codeTextureViewcode and performance is a little better  about 510 frames per second still terrible but better. The user draws into a bitmap, which is then later drawn into the texture using a background thread. Im using Xamarin but hopefully the code makes sense to Java people.p  precodeprivate void RunUpdateThread      try              TimeSpan sleep  TimeSpan.FromSeconds1.0f  60.0f         while true                      lock dirtyRect                              if dirtyRect.Width gt 0 ampamp dirtyRect.Height gt 0                                      Canvas c  LockCanvasdirtyRect                     if c  null                                              c.DrawBitmapbitmap, dirtyRect, dirtyRect, bufferPaint                         dirtyRect.Set0, 0, 0, 0                         UnlockCanvasAndPostc                                                                Thread.Sleepsleep                   catch            codepre  pIf I change lockCanvas to pass null instead of a rect, performance is great at 60 fps, but the contents of the codeTextureViewcode flicker and get corrupted, which is disappointing. I would have thought it would simply be using an OpenGL frame buffer  render texture underneath or at least have an option to preserve contents.p  pAre there any other options short of doing everything in raw OpenGL in Android for high performance drawing and painting on a surface that is preserved in between draw callsp

Even worse, the getter promises to be applicable to const objects, but is merrily used to mutate the internal state of FileManager. Breaking encapsultion is a sure path to making refactorings harder. li ol  pAre there other arguments for not writing code like this that I would be missingp

The variables that start with y stand for the year, m for the month and d for the day. The variables that end in 1 correspond to the first person, while those that end in 2 correspond to the second person. The function returns 1 if the first person is older, 0 if they have the same age, and 1 if the first person is younger. You do not need to check whether the inputs have appropriate values. For example, you may assume that both m1 and m2 are positive integers that are less than 13 and that the day numbers fit with their months.p  precodefunction x  older y1,m1,d1,y2,m2,d2   if d1 gt d2 ampamp m1 gt m2 ampamp y1 gt y2     x  1  elseif d1 lt d2 ampamp m1 lt m2 ampamp y1 lt y2     x  1  else      x  0  end codepre  pI cant see where I am going wrong any help would be greatly appreciated. thanksp

Negative 1018 pThis is a strange one and strace is not giving me any useful information. I am using pyinotify 0.9.6 to watch a directory recursively so I can commit changes about it to a MySQL database. The problem is when I have pyinotify running daemonized or not, i can remove files in the subdirectories but not the subdirectories themselves. rmdir exits with status 0 and everything looks right on the system level, but the sub directory is still there just chilling. I may just be being stupid as I am new to the framework, but here is an example of how I am initializing the watchp  precodewm  pyinotify.WatchManager notifier  pyinotify.Notifierwm wm.addwatchpathtodir, pyinotify.INCLOSEWRITE, recTrue, autoaddTrue,         procfunCommitFunction  I can supply this if you think its relevant notifier.loopdaemonizeTrue, callbackNone,         stdoutpathtolog.log, stderrpathtolog.log codepre  pSo in this example if there was a file pathtodirfile.txt I could run a rm on file.txt and it gets deleted, but if there was a subdirectory pathtodirsubdir running rm r on subdir exits cleanly but the directory doesnt actually get deleted.p  pFurthermore my logs arent getting written, but I am pretty sure thats my fault somewhere.p  pEDITp  pHere is an example CommitFunctionp  precodeclass CommitFunctionpyinotify.ProcessEvent     def processdefaultself, event         dir  event.path         file  event.name         print s is the new file  os.path.joindir, file codepre  pEDIT2 Actually my logs probably arent getting written because I dont call a log or print function anywhere during the commit. I just write straight to my MySQL databasep  pEDIT3 Ok here goes. Hopefully I am not delving too deep. Here is what I try on the command linep  precodebash cd varwww bash mkdir subdir bash rmdir subdir bash ls subdir codepre  pHere is the actual commit functionp  precodeclass CommitFunctionpyinotify.ProcessEvent     def processdefaultself, event         dir  event.path         file  event.name         dbaccess.commitdir, file  dir corresponds to a project name codepre  pI can keep going deeper if you want, but dbaccess has all my functions for committing and querying the database nothing really touching the fs and it further draws from a models file that defines my tables. Its a flaskuwsgi app if that helps at allp

Negative 1018 pIm trying to write a code that handles a linked list. This linked list is somehow different because its a keyvalue pair linked list singly.

Negative 1018 pI started building an API with the Phoenix Framework. I just started learning Elixir and Phoenix so please excuse my lack of knowledge.p  pThe data structure for my app relies on heavy use of relationships over multiple nodes. So I plan on using OrientDB. There is an a hrefhttpsgithub.comMyMedsAndMemarcopolo relnofollowOrientDB driver for Elixira. But so far it is just a binary driver and not integrated with Ecto. And there is a Token authentication solution for Phoenix a hrefhttpsgithub.comMyMedsAndMemarcopolo relnofollowMarco Poloa using Ecto. p  pSince I am just building a prototype and am not that good with Elixir yet I think about the best way to deal with the missing link. Start integrating Marco Polo with Ecto or just store the user information for authentication in PostgreSQL. I then would have to mirror the users in OrientDB to be able to link them to records.p  pAt the moment I favor using PostgreSQL and OrientDB together. Is there a downside I am not aware of Has anyone done something similar and can share their experiencep

Negative 1018 pOkay, so here is what I am currently doingp  pI am building a basetemplate, which defines a header, maindiv, navbar and a footer. In all the templates extending that one all you have to define is the actual content of what goes in your main content. That worked quite well, since all the navbar contained were links to the modellistview and modelcreateview.p  pNow, when I am in the model list view, I want to be able to sort the list by a status and I wanted to add that ability to the navbar. I wonder how to go about this best, since the only template needing this new behaviour is the list view. The other templates shall remain unchanged.p  pCould I just add another  block filterthingie   endblock  into the navbar I have now and fill it only in the listviewp  pI am still a little unsure about the best way to structure my templates. In the worst case I could always just make a second navbar just for the listview I guess, but I kind of wanted to avoid that.p  pparts of The basetemplatep  precode block content    ltdiv classcontainerfluidgt     ltdiv classrowgt       ltdiv classcolsm3 colmd2 sidebargt         ltul classnav navsidebargt            ltligtlta hreflistview classactivegtAll objects of modelltagtltligt           ltligtlta hrefcreateviewgtCreate new object of modelltagtltligt          ltulgt       ltdivgt       ltdiv classcolsm9 colsmoffset3 colmd10 colmdoffset2 maingt          block ordercontent  endblock        ltdivgt     ltdivgt   ltdivgt  endblock content  codepre  pYeah, so it might be that I am just thinking way to complicated here, but I definitely want to keep the structure nice and not repeat myself if I dont have to.p  pI appreciate all the input, thanks for reading. p
