Negative 7989 pIm writing a program under MS Visual C 6.0 yes, I know its ancient, no theres nothing I can do to upgrade.  Im seeing some behavior that I think is really weird.  I have a class with two constructors defined like thisp  precodeclass MyClass  public     explicit MyClassbool bAbsolute  true, bool bLocation  false  mbAbsolutebAbsolute, mbLocationbLocation        MyClassconst RWCStringamp strPath, bool bLocation  false  private     bool mbAbsolute     bool mbLocation  codepre  pWhen I instantiate an instance of this class with this syntax codeMyClassblahcode, it calls the first constructor.  As you can see, I added the codeexplicitcode keyword to it in the hopes that it wouldnt do that... no dice.  It would appear to prefer the conversion from codeconst char code to codeboolcode over the conversion to codeRWCStringcode, which has a copy constructor which takes a codeconst char code.  Why does it do this  I would assume that given two possible choices like this, it would say its ambiguous.  What can I do to prevent it from doing this  If at all possible, Id like to avoid having to explicitly cast the codestrPathcode argument to an codeRWCStringcode, as its going to be used with literals a lot and thats a lot of extra typing plus a really easy mistake to make.p

Negative 7989 pIm writing a wrapper layer to be used with mingw which provides the application with a virtual UTF8 environment. Functions which deal with filenames are wrappers which convert from UTF8 and call the corresponding w functions, and so on. The big problem Ive run into is that Windows codewchartcode is 16bit.p  pFor filesystem operations, its not a big deal. I can just convert back and forth between UTF8 and UTF16, and everything will work. But the standard C multibytewide character conversion API does not allow multiwchart characters.p  pPossible solutionsp  ol liProvide a CESU8 environment instead of UTF8. I really dont like this one.li liTake the easy way out and only support the BMP. Treat UTF8 sequences of length 4 as invalid.li liExtending the wrapper to replace mingws codewchartcode with codetypedef int32t wchartcode and dealing with codeWCHARcode and codewchartcode being different. This is a pain but it may be ideal for porting apps that expect a clean POSIXtype environment and dont use codewchartcode for any WindowsAPI purposes.li liThe following hackli ol  pcodembrtowccode outputs a codewchartcode corresponding to the high surrogate after reading the first 3 bytes of a 4byte UTF8 character, and keeps the remaining state in the codembstatetcode object. Upon receiving the next byte, it combines it with the saved state to output the low surrogate. If the last byte ends up being invalid, it returns 1 with EILSEQ and a lone surrogate ends up in the output stream bad....p  pcodewcrtombcode outputs the first 2 bytes of UTF8 when it processes the high surrogate, and saves the remaining state in its codembstatetcode object. When it subsequently processes the low surrogate, it combines that with the saved state to output the last 2 bytes of UTF8. If a valid low surrogate is not received, it returns 1 with EILSEQ and an incomplete UTF8 sequence ends up in the output stream bad....p  pThe plus side of this hack is that it works as long as input is valid, and allows access to any UTF8 character and thus any possible filenameargumentetc. text the application might need to work with.p  pThe cons are that its not strictly conformant to ISO C codewchartcode string is not allowed to be stateful and that it delays detection of malformed characters until incorrect partial output has already been written.p  pIm looking for feedback on the different options, and especially my proposed hack whether its reasonable, whether the cons are likely to cause severe errors, and whether there are any other cons I havent yet considered which might keep the scheme from working entirely.

Negative 7989 pI have an application that requires me to clean dirty filenames.  p  pI was wondering if anybody knew how to handle files that are named likep  p1.0.1.21  Confidential...doc or Accounting.Files.docp  pBasically theres no guarantee that the periods will be in the same place for every file name.  I was hoping to recurse through a drive, search for periods in the filename itself minus the extension, remove the period and then append the extension onto it.p  pDoes anybody know either a better way to do this or how do perform what Im hoping to do As a note, regEx is a REQUIREMENT for this project.  p  pEDIT  Instead of seeing 1.0.1.21  Confidential...doc, Id like to see  10121  Confidential.doc br  For the other filename, Instead of Accounting.Files.doc, id like to see AccountingFiles.docp
Negative 7989 pbr I have a heavily modified control based on TStringGrid. I want to allow the user to make selections in this grid but restrict the selection one single row the current row.p  pImplementation When the user presses the left mouse button I am using a dirty hack On OnMouseDown event I capture the mouse cursor and keep it on the current row. The user can move the mouse device up and down on its pad but the cursor will not go up or down. It will stay on the current row. When the user releases the button OnMouseUp event, I release the capture.p  pHowever, this hack is as I said very dirty. There are several problems. For example, if the user presses the left mouse button LMB and then without releasing that button it presses the right button, the associated popup menu will pop but the mouse capture will never be released. So, the mouse will be locked in a screen region until the user will has the brilliant idea to click the LMB one more time to unlock the mouse. This may be a bug in D7. There is a separate post about it here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3285604tstringgridonmouseupisnotcalledhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3285604tstringgridonmouseupisnotcalledap  pThere is a elegant way to do thisp  hr  pEdit OnSelectCell is not working. OnSelectCell event is called only once when you click the cell. If you keep the button pressed and move the mouse to expand the selection, OnSelectCell will not be called again. Indeed MoveCurrent appears only in TCustomGrid.MouseDown.p

Negative 7989 pHas anyone tried using any of the jQuery themes in jsFiddlep  pIm interested in using the Accordion widget with a theme but having  trouble implementing it in jsFiddle. The trouble is, I believe the themes require  image files to populate some of its effects, and my suspicion is that  jsFiddle has some sort of issue with that.

Negative 7989 pCould you please suggest some solution for the following queryp  pI am writing a WPF application which can read from an XML schema, and show a designer UI to the user.The user can use the designer to add data and save it as an XML instance. He can reopen the the XML instance and viewedit the instance in the designer.p  pI am following the MVVM pattern to implement this. I will be writing model classes for the XML elements and bind it to the designer view. A data access layer will be populating the data in the model classes. I am very curious to know if there is any easy to use readymade XML to Data Objects which I will use as my data access layer. This data access layer needs to be efficient enough to hold just one XML instance in the memory and handle the readsave of XML instance.p  pAlso, please feel free to comment on the overall approach I am taking in this design. I feel like this is a bit over complicated design, but cant help it.p

Negative 7989 pIm making an application in C WPF that consists of a toproot NavigationWindow with several pages that I navigate between for the purpose of the project. At this point, I want to extend the functionality of the application by adding in a second state of the program.p  pHeres how Id like this to work Essentially the program is a data collection application. At the moment it displays relevant UI information for database A and allows you to collect data for that one specifically. I want to expand the software by adding in a second set of UI elements that collect different data for database B, and I want to navigate between them using Tabs at the top so using tabcontrol and tabitems.p  pThe part that Im stuck on is the maintaining states portion For example, if Im on the tab for database A, I can go through a date selection screen and to the actual collection screen, but if I click on the tab for database B, then it will still be back at the date selection screen since I have not done anything there yet essentially like having 2 programs running at the same time, within each tab.p  pI tried seeing if I could change the root element of the software from a NavigationWindow to a Page that contains a NavigationWindow inside of tabitems since only Page implements tabcontrol, but I have not figured out how to do this if it can even be done. Is there a better way to go about doing thisp

Negative 7989 pI am currently a good portion of the way through developing a socket based implementation of a generic communication framework that works between C and Android.p  pBuilding the server and client has been easy enough. Nothing too technically challenging about that.p  pAt this point the implementation contains 2 major components.p  blockquote   pAndroidTcpListener tcp socket class   that handles communication Br   AndroidTcpServer class that creates   an instance of the TcpListener and   handles the DataReceived from the   TcpListener when data is receivedp      pData is sent between the client and   the server using the standard XML   serializer I may move to JSON at some   point but for the time being I have   settled on XMLp blockquote  pWhere I seem to be completely stuck is how to handle and expose the data received.p  pI have tried using generics but no matter how I structure it, it seems that in the end I end up having to create an codeAndroidTcpServerltTgtcode which then restricts me to a single datatype.p  pI have tried creating a CustomActivator class as suchp  precodeclass CustomActivatorltTgt where T  Serialization.ITcpSerializableltTgt      public CustomActivatorString xmlTypeName, Byte[] data               this.XmlTypeName  xmlTypeName         this.Data  data           public String XmlTypeName  get set      public Byte[] Data  get set       public T Activate              T res   Activator.CreateInstanceltTgt         using MemoryStream stream  new MemoryStreamthis.Data                      return res.DeserializeXElement.Loadstream                               codepre  pBut again this seems to restrict me to implementing codeAndroidTcpServerltTgtcodep  pI have tried creating an AndroidTcpEvent class which is structured as suchp  precodepublic class AndroidTcpEventltTgt      public AndroidTcpEvent       public AndroidTcpEventString eventName, T data              this.EventName  eventName         this.Data  data           public String EventName  get set      public T Data  get set   codepre  pBut the XMLSerializer seems to refuse to want to serialize it I guess I could implement my own serializer but this is far from trivial and doesnt really solve how I will expose the datap  pI have tried countless other approaches which all seem to hit a dead end somewhere.p  pSo basically at this point I have Inside of the AndroidTcpServer class a method as suchp  precodeprivate void DataReceivedObject sender, TcpServerMessageReceivedEventArgs e      e.Data  Byte[] of XML serialized data of the message sent Semantics are unimportant  codepre  pIn conclusion I am hoping for some guidance on how one would typically handle exposing data received and actually creating instances of the data in such a  generic framework and if there are any known patterns that can be used for this problemp  pObviously I could scrape all this generic implementation stuff and just create a custom implementation for whatever app I end up trying to build but I am doing this as both a learning exercise and something that I would like to release into the public for others to use.p  pHopefully I have been clear but if anyone requires clarification on any aspect of this please let me know. Thanks in advance for everyones input.p
Negative 7989 pI am developing an application for strongbrowsing imagesstrong. I have already implemented the browsing mechanism by using standard text anchors outside the image. p  pNow I would like to implement the browsing mechanism inside the image. Lets make it clear.  The user sees the image and upon strongonMouseOver eventstrong, depending on which side of the picture the pointer goes, it is shown an arrow respectively on the right or left side. Upon strongonClick eventstrong, on the right or left side of the picture, the user should be able to browse to the previousnext image. It is not necessary to click on the arrow to browse.p  pNow I know that it is possible implement this function with Javascript, especially the jQuery framework has some interesting functions to do this. I am following this approachp  ol lipCreate a div container for the image and place the codeltimggtcode tag inside.pli lipDefine the position for the navigation arrows inside the container.pli lipUpon strongonMouseOver eventstrong call a jquery function that places an arrow image in the position defined at step 2.pli lipUse some strongfadingstrong function to implement the fade effect.pli lipUpon click call the image browsing functions already implemented.pli ol  pMy doubts are mainly aboutp  pQ1 Is my approach above listed points correctp  pQ2 How can I adjust the position of the browsing arrows depending on the image sizep  pQ3 How can make jQuery understand whether the user is strongonMouseOverstrong or strongonClickedstrong to the left or right part of the imagep  pAlthough all the answers are appreciated, I am not asking plain code to copy paste and adjust in my application, but I would like to know whether my approach is correct and have a couple of useful jQuery or any other JS framework functions to implement this functionality. p
Negative 7989 pAt work we have a large... 12 years of development ahead with a dozen of people in the team project that will soon start and the higher ups are considering Spring 3 as the web framework marketing hot air... whatever.p  pThis is not a trivial web application and we dont have experience with Spring 3 although we have some experience with Spring 2 already... but were by no means experts. We are supposed to learn Spring 3 and start coding. p  pBut there is this feeling I have that well have a hard time.p  pSpring 3 GA is around for an year or so and books seem not to have yet catched up. There is Pro Spring 3 and the third edition of Spring in action that I found so far covering Spring 3. The online tutorials are not very complex, and it seems the reference is all weve got as a solid foundation which is a terse document.p  pAs I said, I have a bad feeling. Dont get me wrong I dont mind learning Spring 3 easy or hard going but Im not sure about the safety of the project large project, small time frame... smell of death march if we go with Spring 3.p  pIm making an appeal to your experience. Have you created large projects with Spring 3 What issues did you encounterp
Negative 7989 pHow do you keep track of your UI elements in Titanium Say you have a window with a TableView that has some Switches onoff in it and youd like to reference the changed switch onchange with a generic event listener. Theres the property event.source, but you still dont really know what field of a form was just toggled, you just have a reference to the element. Is there a way to give the element an ID, as you would with a radiobutton in JavaScriptp  pUp to now, registered each form UI element in a dictionary, and saved all the values at once, looping through the dictionary and getting each object value. But now Id like to do this onchange, and I cant find any other way to do it than create a specific callback function for each element which Id really rather not.p

Negative 7989 pI have a collection of objects at runtime, which is already serializable, I need to persist the state of the object to a file. I did a quick coding using BinaryFormatter and saved A serialized object to a file.p  pI was thinking that I can save object per line. but when i open the file in a notepad, it was longer than a line. It wasnt scrolling. How can i store an binary serialized object per linep  pI am aware that i can use a separator after each object so while reading them back to the application, i can know the end of the object. Well, according to information theory, this increases the size of the dataSipser book. p  pWhat s the best algorithm to come up with a separator that woudldnt break the informationp  pInstead of binary serialization Do you think JSon format is more feasible can i store the entity in a json format, line by linep  pAlso, serializationdeserialization introduces overhead, hits the performance. Would Json be fasterp  pideasp  pThanks.p  pThanks.p

Negative 7989 pWe got a WCF service that is calling some unmanaged code. The unmanaged code is using COM and creating COM objects to do some legacy work. We noticed that when the application pool recycle happens due to web.config change. The service is not always able to rehost again in a new application domain and the w3wp.exe appear to be hang. I am not getting errors or logs, except that I cant communicate to the service anymore. Killing the process and starting a new one woks. Is there a way to tell IIS not to use application domain recycle due to legacyunmanaged code in the w3wp.exe. I noticed that when using recycle on private bytes limit there is a process recycle and not a app domain recycle. What else can I do to find out the state of the w3wp.exe process and why it is hang.p  pI am also noticing that different recycle options create different ways to recycle. When using the UI in IIS a recycle removes the processes and put new ones. When setting a memory limit the same happens. But when changing a web config, an app domain recycle happens. Is there information to what type of recycle occurs based on the different trigger and is there ways to configure itp

Negative 7989 pIm working on a gallery that pulls up a full image inside a tooltip when hovering over thumbnails. The problem is, these full images commonly go outside the viewfinder. To remedy this, Im moving the tooltip if the image will go outside the window boundaries, which requires immediately knowing the images dimensions to avoid the tooltip jumping around. However, the images take a bit to load .gifs so I cant wait on DOM in order to get the dimensions. So, Im calling a PHP script to return the the image dimensions before they load.p  pThe problem Im having is that theres no response from my .get call. I know the PHP script is working fine, but Im not getting any data back from it through jquery. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Negative 7989 pOkay just to be clear, I have really limited knowledge of php. Now, im trying to make a script that generates random youtube videos based on number of views, country and category like this one a hrefhttpwww.flyhour.tvindex.php relnofollowherea using their api. I managed to get a working drop list to select minimum number of views the video has to have to be shown  its working pretty nicely next ill try to make the other two work, but the issue is that i dont know how to make the drop list keep the selected value after the page is refreshed.

Why should the interrupted method even be used It just seems to me that Java just adds an extra layer of indirection.li liFor synchronization and specifically about the one in that link, how does adding the synchronize keyword even fix the problem I mean, if Thread A gives back its incremented c and Thread B gives back the decremented c and store it to some other variable, I am not exactly sure how the problem is solved. I mean this may be answering my own question, but is it supposed to be assumed that after one of the threads return an answer, terminate And if that is the case, why would adding synchronize make a differenceli liI read from some random PDF that if you have two Threads start subsequently, you cannot guarantee that the first thread will occur before the second thread. How would you guarantee it, thoughli liIn synchronization statements, I am not completely sure whats the point of adding synchronized within the method.

I told him that it took several seconds to generate a controls tree, and after profiling I found out that it is using a string concatenation in a loop instead of a StringBuilder. After rewriting it worked almost instantaneously.p  pSo my friend heard that and seemed to be surprised that the C compiler didnt do that conversion automatically like the Java compiler does.

Negative 7989 pI used to be able to access my localhost through my wampserver but not anymore. It just opens up a blank page in every browser that keeps on loading. I did some research and noticed this problem usually occurs when a program using port 80 such as Skype is interfering. Well I do have skype but I unchecked the use port 80 and 443 as alternatives for incoming connections option so thats not it. I even typed netstat in the cmd screen to check which program could be using port 80 but its open so I suspect the problem to be elsewhere. Besides, even after editing httpd.conf and swapping my port to 8080 it still does nothing and yes I surfed to localhost8080. I dont think my hosts file is to blame either. It clearly says 127.0.0.1 localhost and theres no hash tag in front of it. I already reinstalled my wampserver and even tried xampp but no dice. Can anyone please tell me if Im missing something. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 7989 pI am not that experienced with JavaAndroid programming.  I have an array of floats that i have logged, and i want to plot them against time. I just want to see what the data looks like, I dont really need to plot it in the app itself, although it would be handy. I am looking for the simplest possible way to do this.  I have looked around at libraries graph view and achartengine which plot graphs in the app, but when i imported them into eclipse, there were errors everywhere on the demo code. Maybe it would be easier to export the array so I can plot it on the computer, e.g. to a csv file for excel But, I can only find stuff on databases with csv files.

Negative 7989 pI am creating a web application having a login page , where number of users can tries to login at same time. so here I need to handle number of  requests at a time. p  pI know this is already implemented for number of popular sites  like codeG talkcode.p  pSo I have some questions in my mind.p  pHow many requests can a port handle at a time  p  pHow many sockets can Iserver create  is there any limitationsp  pFor e.g . As we know when we implement client server communication using Socket programmingTCP, we pass a port numberunreserved port numberto server for creating a socket .p  pSo I mean to say if 100000 requests came at a single time then what will be approach of port to these all requests. p  pIs he manitains some queue for all these requests , or he just accepts number of requests as per his limit if yes what is handling request limit size of port p  pSummary I want to know how server serves multiple requests simultaneouslyI dont know any thing about it. I know we are connection to a server via its ip address and port number thats it. So I thought there is only one port and many request come to that port only via different clients so how server manages all the requestsp  pThis is all I want to know. If you explain this concept in detail it would be very helpful. Thanks any way. p

Negative 7989 pIm having trouble with Windows Authentication in IIS7 and really in despair now. We have an ASP.NET 4 application deployed in IIS server with Windows Authentication enabled. When the client machine perform a request to the website, Windows authentication popup appears expected behavior. However, after I authenticate using valid credential, IIS doesnt work under the provided credential.  I know this because the connection to database server failed with the following message Login failed for user NT AUTHORITYANONYMOUS LOGON Impersonation authentication is also turned on I think that the issue lies in the configuration in IIS because when I tried to authenticate using an invalid credential, the Client windows authentication popup persists and prompt me to another try.p  pThe interesting phenomenon is that when I remote to IIS server, open IE , fill in the address in the form of httplocalhost.... The authentication popup does not appear, but it automatically take my credential and works perfectly. Yet, once again,when I try http10.16.9.99... IP address of the machine, or httpiissrv... machine name, the same issue occurs the windows authentication form appear and after I enter the valid credential, the application is not run under the provided credentialp  pIm really desperate  now.

Negative 7989 pIm currently trying to replicate the effect shown in Douglas Crockfords presentation a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvzKuFu19LgZAt1200s relnofollowPrinciples of Securitya. As a demonstration of the risk of using One Time Pad encryption keys twice, he shows two images, encrypts them with the same key and subtracts the one from the other, resulting in both images shown at the same time.p  pMy approach uses four canvas elements, one for showing the key, two for loading images and the fourth as the destination for the subtraction. Im able to generate a somewhat random key, load images and encrypt them. Problems start when trying to decrypt an image. For that, Im loading an image to the first container, encrypt it, then encrypt the second container which results in a copy of the key and then subtract the pixels of both containers. The original image is still recognizable, but random pixels appear on the canvas.p  pWhen loading an image to the second container, one should be able to get an inverted version when subtracting it from the empty first container. Unexpectedly, the canvas stays blank.p  pMy current state is viewable at a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netMud6y relnofollowJSFiddlea, please have a look.p

Negative 7989 pI have a JavaScript program in which I will be managing a lot of ranges of integers. In this context, a range is simply a start and an end value or anything equivalent, like a start and a length value, with a reference to another object. The ranges can overlap, and can be identical although the referenced object will be different.p  pThe possible start and end values are between 0 and 4294967295 2sup32sup  1 or code0xFFFFFFFFcode, although there are several big holes in the domain that no range will ever cover, even partially. Most ranges will be very small compared to the domain of possibilities I expect that the overwhelming majority will have a length smaller than 2000.p  pMy most important use case for this structure will be to look up all ranges that contain a given integer value. Most of the time, I expect the lookup to fail there will be no range containing the given value.p  pOtherwise, I will obviously also need to add elements to it often and delete elements from it seldom. Once in a while, too, Ill need to find all ranges that overlap a given range, rather than all ranges that contain a single value.p  pWhat kind of data structure can I use for that A linear search in a list of ranges is impractical because the lookups fail most of the time and I need to do lookups very, very often.p

For one i could let GenericDao throw a checked exception, but since aproximatly 99 of tables dont have a uniquefield other than the pk this isnt acceptable. Making UserExistsException a RuntimeException and document it seams not very nice either since i want to force the user of the method to catch the exception and report it to the enduser. Creating a new userDao.createUsermethod that throws the Exeption and throwing an UnsupportedOperationException with the already existing userDao.createmethod seams to me to be the tidiest of all solutions which came to my mind so far. I still would love to know, what is the proper way to solve this problemp

And would suit there better, as it would avoid GUI stalls that are so annoying for the user.p  pHowever, GUI cannot work in a worker thread, and dependency injection is pretty much impossible to do, because it would go down several layers of computational code.

Ive mocked up a a hrefhttptest.nesevis.infofooter relnofollowlive examplea. p  pTo minimize the loss of clickable realestate in lower layers through the transparent part of the footer image, my instinct is to cut the image into several segments red boxes in the example and position them next to each other like sop  pre classlangcss prettyprintoverridecodearcsegment1, arcsegment2     position fixed    zindex 2    bottom 0px  arcsegment1     width 5  where this     height 82px    left 0    backgroundimage url...  arcsegment2     width 5    height 72px    left 5  matches this     backgroundimage url...  codepre  pIn most major browsers not IE and FF, stronghairline fractures come and go between boxes as the window is resizedstrong, which is unacceptable.p  pFloating the image segments would solve the problem, but I have not found a way of implementing it that still fixes the footer to the bottom and preserve the mentioned clickability. Is there a better approach to this problem than mine, or can it somehow be remediedp  pemNote regarding the example given The curve image itself in the example has not yet been cut, it is still a single image. Also, the blue boxes are not a concern, they will not stretch so they are not affected by the problem.emp  pId be interested in both the reasons of this behavior and any workable solution. Thanks.p

Negative 7989 pI have a MVC application that I would like to port at least a small part of it to a mobile app android first.  My first objective was to try to figure out how to authenticate the users.p  pIt seems that forms based authentication uses cookies and that is not usable by mobile apps Definitive confirmation would be appreciated.p  pBut it seemed that you could do some form of authentication using a WCF service to create a token.  Now I found a lot of sites that discussed how to create and secure the service end point but none really discussed the token generation.p  pThen quite by accident I stumbled upon WIF and the usersecuritytoken, which seems to what I am looking to accomplish.p  pSo if some could please confirm this is where I need to be looking so I can actually get back to coding rather than reading I would appreciate it.p  pThe way I see this working isp  ol liSecure WCF service.li liUsing the System.IdentityModel it generates a token for a valid user and passes it back to the mobile app.li liThen the app passes the token along anytime a service requiring privilege is called. For example updating the users profile.li ol  pIs that how it is suppose to work If not could you please point me to an example of how it is suppose to work.p  pOne other question, looking at the WIF site it seems to provide a lot of token types, what is the preferred type for android and iOSp  pstrongUPDATEstrong As it was pointed out it would be helpful if I provided more context. The original website is a MVC3 web app.p  pI am attempting to write an app for some of the backend administration features using mono touch.p  pWCF seems to be a bad solution for cross platform and a package called ServiceStack is what I am now leaning towards for my web services.  ServiceStack has its own authentication module but it does not interface with the .net membershipprovider which is an issue since the web app was designed with the membership provider.p  pI have to be overthinking this.

Negative 7989 pI am making a C function to integrate into Python that basically creates a twodimensional array of chars each row has constant, known length, reads some data into it, builds a numpy array from it, and returns it to the calling function in Python. Im not an expert with C, but I believe that in order to preserve the array in memory after exiting the function where it was created, I need to allocate it on the heap with malloc. So I am trying this linep  precoderowSize and interleaved are both integers bytesPerTable is equal to rowSize  interleaved char arrs[interleaved][rowSize]  char mallocbytesPerTable  sizeofchar codepre  pWhich gives me the compiler errorp  precodeerror variablesized object may not be initialized codepre  pIm not sure how to make this work.

Negative 7989 pWhile reading some notes on performance tuning, I did notice a recommendations while setting memory sizep  pJava application should size both initial and maximum permanent generation size to the same value since growing or contracting the permanent generation space requires a full GC.

Negative 7989 pI made a small function that fills an allocated block of memory containing every position of a given char within a given string and returns a pointer to the memory block. p  pThe only problem with this function is that there is no way to check the size of the memory block so I also made a function that counts the occurrence of a given char within a string.p  pHere is an example of usep  precodecount occurences of char within a given string sizet strchrocconst char str, const char ch       int c  0     whilestr ifstr  ch c     return c   build array of positions of given char occurences within a given string int chrposconst char str, const char ch      int array, tmp, c  0, i  0      ifarray  mallocstrlenstr  sizeofint return 0x00     whilestr[c]              ifstr[c]  ch array[i]  c         c          iftmp  reallocarray, i  sizeofint return 0x00     array  tmp     return array   int mainvoid      char str  foobar foobar                o occurs at str[1], str[2], str[8], and str[9]     int array, b  0, d      ifarray  chrposstr, o exit1    array[0]  1, array[1]  2, array[2]  8, array[3]  9             This is okay since I know that o       only occures 4 times in str. There       may however be cases where I do not       know how many times a given char        occurs so I figure that out before       utilizing the contents of array.       I do this with my function strchroc.       Below is a sample of how I would        utilize the data contained within       array. This simply prints out str       and on a new line prints the given       chars location within the str        array            putsstr     whileb lt int strchrocstr, o         loop once for each o               ford  0 d lt b  0  array[b]  array[b]  array[b  1]  1 d putcint  , stdout         printfd, array[b]         b       codepre  pOutputp  precodefoobar foobar  12     89 codepre  pMy only concern is that if one of these two functions fail, there is no way for the data to be used correctly. I was thinking about making the number of occurrences of codecharcode within the string an argument for codechrposcode but even then I would still have to call both functions.p  pI was wondering if anybody had any suggestions for a way to do this so that I only need one function to build the array. p  pThe only way I can think of is by storing the number of char occurrences into codearray[0]code and having codearray[1] through array[charoccurences]code holding the positions of codecharcode. p  pIf anybody has a better idea I would greatly appreciate it.p
Negative 7989 pFirst, let me explain what I am doing. I have a CVS repository that I store 5,000 Data Definition Language files in. These 5,000 files are generated from an external data modeling application, they are text and have windows CRLFs. During development, if I need to make a change, I regenerate the 5,000 files and then overwrite the contents of my local CVS workspace in eclipse. The full overwritereplacement is to make sure that I dont miss any updates to files. After overwritingreplacing the files, I use eclipse to do a team lt synchronize with repository. When I do this, the comparison flags every single file as an outgoing change because it looks to not be ignoring CRLFs in its comparison. I have Ignore white space checked off and the eclipse documentation states that it should be ignoring CRLFsp  precode Ignore whitespace option  Causes the comparison to ignore differences which are whitespace characters   spaces, tabs, etc.. Also causes differences in line terminators  LF   versus CRLF to be ignored. codepre  pWhen I open the files in text compare, it shows no diffs but there is an extra CRLF at top of one of the files. Is this a bug or is there an option I am missing in eclipse It looks like the problem is that it doesnt ignore CRLFs that are on their own line.p

Negative 7989 pI dont know how to compile and run Java program with another library. I read many threads about this, but none of them helped. Most of them just talking around it and stuff instead of providing a decent example. Although trying for the past week, I couldnt make it to work. p  pImagine I have the following structure  is home directoryp  ul liGraph.javali lijmathplot.jar li ul  pGraph.java starts withp  precodeimport org.math.plot.Plot2DPanel  public class Graph  ...  codepre  pIt org.math.plot corresponds to .jar structure. So from what I read if I run this from  directoryp  precodejavac classpath .jmathplot.jar Graph.java codepre  pthis should work. But it doesnt. It just generates bunch of .class files from jmathplot.jar and when trying to run it I get NoClassDefFoundError. If I extract org folder from jmathplot.jar and put it next to Graph.java it works flawlessly which is expected you dont even need to specify classpath.p  pI think of classpath as a guidance to JVM where to look for files. Specifying jmathplot.jar instructs JVM to look for orgmathplot structure in jmathplot.jar. p  pWhere am I wrong Could someone provide me a correct way to compile and run this Graph.java I would greatly appreciate it.

Negative 7989 pI am trying to read from a text file and use the input to create multiple different objects.

Negative 7989 pI am trying to create a web service using JAXWS SOAP allowing CRUD operations on some entities. I am also writing a desktop client with an UI which provides easy means of doing CRUD on those entities via the web service.p  pHowever, I am running into some design issues. I would like the client to only be able to view and manipulate certain fields of an entity, and Im not sure whats the best way to impose this restriction.p  pFor instance, givenp  precodeEntity public class Customer     Id   GeneratedValue   public Long id    public String name     neither read nor write from the web service   public String password     readonly from the web service   TemporalTemporalType.DATE   public Date joinedAt    ManyToOne   LazyCollectionLazyCollectionOption.FALSE   private ListltOrdergt orders     .. boilerplate getters and setters   Entity public class Order     Id   GeneratedValue   public Long id    public String name  codepre  pI would like to provide the client with these basic operationsp  ol liget the list of all customers with their orders ul lihe can see all the fields EXCEPT for codepasswordcodeli ulli licreate a new customer with some orders ul liallow control to all fields EXCEPT FOR codejoinedAtcode and codepasswordcodeli ulli limodify a customer ul lisame as above, youre not allowed to modify codejoinedAtcode or codepasswordcodeli ulli ol  p.p  ol lipMy current solution for 1 is to add XmlTransient to the password field. This is problematic if you want to send the password to certain clients but not to others. Another solution would be to do codecustomer.setPasswordnullcode before marshalling that entity via the webservice. But is this really the way to do it A third solution would be to create a base class codeBaseCustomercode which contains all the fields except for codepasswordcode and then Customer would be a codeBaseCustomercode with the added codepasswordcode field. The user would receive a BaseCustomer object instead of a Customer one. But this has problems with createupdate as well.pli lipSame as for 1, one solution is to do codecustomer.setJoinedAtmyvalue customer.setPasswordmyvalue customer.setIdnullcode when the client wants to create a new customer. Is manually nulling the codeidcode really best practice I find that hard to believe. Should the codeidcode be XmlTransient as well But then how would the user of the web service be able to modifydelete entitiespli lipWhen the client wants to change a codeCustomercode, he retrieves the list of customers, makes changes to one of the codeCustomercode objects, then marshals that object and passes it back to the web service. There are a few problems with this if the codeidcode field is XmlTransient, then the EntityManagers persist wont know which row to modify and would likely create a new one. A similar issue raises if the user is evil and simply refuses to pass an codeidcode, so I have to manually check that the codeidcode is nonnull. Moreover, the user has not received the codepasswordcode field, so now the server has received an object with a null codepasswordcode field which it will attempt to persist. I believe this will cause the EntityManager to completely remove the password of that existing Customer. Having the user specify exactly which fields he wants modified and to which values seems impractical.pli ol  pNote that this is just a proofofconcept of what I need to do in a nutshell, I have far more entities, relations and operations to provide.p  pI am new to using these technologies and I was hoping that being so high level and having so many abstractions would make my life easier, but so far it has been mostly headaches. It appears very difficult to achieve this common, basic task. Am I doing something wrong Please dont suggest creating a web application instead p

Negative 7989 pMy understanding of interfaces is that they cannot contain method definitions, only signatures and constant declarations. I have an arraylist that contains a collection of interface objects. In this case, it looks like p  pListlt StoreItem  items  new ArrayListlt StoreItem p  pand StoreItem is my interface that looks like thisp  precodepublic interface StoreItem  Operations public String getMaker public Patron getItemBuyer public Date getManufactureDate public String getManufacturer public String getProductName public void setItemBuyerPatron purchase      codepre  pI have a method to create a new item and add it to the list. It seems to work ok, in that Im not getting any problems on the unit test and no exceptions are caught. However I have that classic newbie problem where I want to print the arraylist to see the contents with my own eyes, and I understand I need to override the toString method for StoreItem. But StoreItem is an interface and obviously it wont let me do anything like this within the Interface. I also have an abstract class implementing this interface, and three subclasses of that abstract class. I am creating an object of one of these subclasses as the StoreItem, so I tried to do a toString override within this subclass. I cant get this to work. I triedp  precodepublic String toString     return super.productName  codepre  pWhich it didnt like, because within the abstract super class productName is private, and needs to be for the sake of the project. I decided to go ahead and change productName to protected anyway just to see if it would still work. I still just get the memory location something like d9sdf83j when printing the list. So I set it back to private and tried to have the toString use the getter method from the superclass on the return, sop  precodepublic String toString     return super.getProductName  codepre  pI still just get the memory location. I dont know if this is enough code to portray whats going on and what Im trying to do. Im hoping the error is rudimentary enough that someone wiser than me can just spot it and point it out, but I can add more code if necessary. Thanks in advance.p  pI still cant get it to work.

Negative 7989 pOkay, Im going to try to simplify this example as much as possible. Heres my problem. Im using node and express with jade to generate html. I have a main layout.jade file which at the end of the body contains thisp  precodeblock scripts   scriptsrcjavascriptslibsjquery1.8.1.min.js codepre  pThen I have a jade partial shapes.jade which has the following codep  precodeblock append scripts   scriptsrcjavascriptswire.js codepre  pThen I have my jade file propertiespanel.jade which generates the htmlp  precodeextends ..layout  include shapes  block controls   include ..controls codepre  pThe wire.js file needs jQuery to run. The html output from jade is exactly as I would expect it to be. I have a block of script tags at the end of the body tag, and in the correct order jQuery first.p  pThe problem is that jQuery is not being loaded by the browser first. BUT, then it seems to also load the file again after jQuery has loaded. I have deduced this because my wire.js file is wrapped in a selfexecuting anonymous function like thisp  precodefunction context,     console.log this, window.jQuery codepre  pAnd in my console I get 2 logs. the first one says undefined and the second one logs jQuery correctly.p  pSo heres the weird part though. If I comment out the script line from my shapes.jade, and instead add it to the layout.jade file after the jQuery import line, it generates the exact same html file, but everything loads in the correct order then.p  pUsing the chrome developer tools, I can see the load order in the resources tab and even though the html does not change at all, the load order changes depending on the way the jade file generates the same identical html.p  pAm I doing something wrong Im relatively new to jade, so I may very well be.p  pThanksp

Negative 7989 pI have a very complex user interface constructed using the GUI builder.p  pAll was working as promised until I added 8 more severside functions to the code. In the GUI Builder when I try to attach these new functions to mouse up, The GUI Builder announces An Unexpected Error occured in a pink stripe across the top of the script editor.p  pWhen I clear the error, the project appears to be OK and I can save and run the application. If I go to any previously object that triggers a server side handler and attempt to change it I get the same error.p  pIt is my suspicion that the failure happens when the GUI builder tries to load the list of available functions from the code source.  My code is running upwards of 50 Gscript functions.p  pIf there are some limits on what the GUI Builder can handle it would be really nice to have those documented.  Also a more meaningful error message would be nice.p  pI assume that I can still addattach these handlers in the code base outside of GUI Builderp

Negative 7989 pThe benefits of wellfactored and modular code, in my understanding are reusability and organization. Code written in a big chunk all in one file is difficult to read, and reusing small portions of the code requires careful copypasting, rather than include statements.p  pIn particular, with regards to Javascript, I came across an example recently that got me thinking about this. A comment was made on SO to the effect that, if you are not including your javascripts conditionally on a pagebypage basis, this represents a failure to modularize JS code properly. However, from a code reuse and organization point of view, there is no reason to consider what happens at page load time. The code will be just as readable if it is written in a bunch of separate files and then mashed together and minified before being served. The a hrefhttpguides.rubyonrails.orgassetpipeline.html relnofollowrails asset pipelinea, for example, does just this.p  pWhen I first encountered the asset pipeline, my mind reeled and I started wondering how do I make javascripts load only when needed I read a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3437585bestwaytoaddpagespecificjavascriptinarails3appa few SO questionsa and a hrefhttprailsapps.github.comrailsjavascriptincludeexternal.html relnofollowan article on the mattera, and began to think that maybe I shouldnt worry about what happens to my code after it compiles.p  pIs the purpose of writing modular code purely a humanlevel activity, should we stop worrying about modularity after the code starts running In the case of Javascript, should we be concerned that our scripts are being mashed together before being includedp

Negative 7989 pI have a really annoying bug, and Ive finally tracked it down. p  pI use or more accurately, already have used a standalone script to create a store of objects, after which I pickle this data structure.

After I do pickle.dump and get this data structure, I had it set up so that I try to check the type of one the objects. Unfortunately, the only thing I can check it against is a emnewem reloading of my classes, which Python recognizes as distinct.p  blockquote   pDEBUG Object I am typechecking  Fixture name Front Desk, location 0, desc The front desk has a sign that read... ltltbr   DEBUG A generic GameObject  GameObject name , location None, desc ...  ltlt  p blockquote  pYou can see that the object representations look very similar.

Negative 7989 pWhen building and tuning a query in Oracle, speed is generally the main concern for the developer. However, in tuning a particular query, I recently tried the FIRSTROWS and NOCPUCOSTING hints and an execution plan was generated that is 80 faster than the previous plan in execution time, but at a 300 higher cost. There is very little IO in the execution plan, and it appears that all the additional cost comes from a nested loop outer join between two views.p  pThis query is paginated, so I will only ever need the first few hundred rows. The lack of significant IO leads me to think that this query will not be cachedependent, and at first glance it seems like the way to go. However, since Ive never seen a query increase in speed emandem cost so much at the same time, Im not sure what the drawbacks to using this query might be. Are there anyp

This all works fine, except the first time the view is drawn.p  pThe positions of the images are scaled after the first measurement.

Negative 7989 pI was hoping to figure this out on my own, but after hours of Googling I have countless examples that I cant get to work.  Heres the scenario.

The examples I have found rely on using the strongPaintEventArgsstrong, but Im not sure how that works and it doesnt seem relevant in this case.  The best Ive been able to do is to get the image to display on the screen, but its not actually attached to the popup window.  I did that using the following code, which is a method inside the popup window classp  precodeDim img as System.Drawing.Image  Base64ToImagebase64string Dim gr As System.Drawing.Graphics  System.Drawing.Graphics.FromHwndNew Interop.WindowInteropHelperMe.Handle gr.DrawImageimg, 10, 10, 500, 800  gr.Dispose codepre  pThis displayed the image, but it seemed to appear at position 10,10 of the screen, not of the popup window.p

Negative 7989 pIm using the a hrefhttpsgithub.comAFNetworkingAFNetworking relnofollowAFNetworkinga library, which is excellent, however Im having trouble keeping track of operations in the NSOperationQueue.  I am adding NSOperation objects to the NSOperationQueue, and I need to keep track of progress  so update a UIProgressView to show how far the queue is to completion and then also execute a block of code once the queue is complete.p  pIve tried KVO  using the answer here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1049001getnotificationwhennsoperationqueuefinishesalltasksGet notification when NSOperationQueue finishes all tasksa however I come across the problem elaborated on the second answer down there where sometimes operations in the queue may complete fast enough to temporarily decrement the operationCount property to 0  which then cause issues with the code in the accepted answer  i.e. prematurely execute the code to be executed after all objects in the queue have finished and progress tracking will not be accurate as a result.p  pA variation Ive tried is checking for operationCount  0 in the success block of each NSOperation that I add to the NSOperationQueue and then executing code based on that, e.g.p  precode    [AFImageRequestOperation imgRequest  [AFImageRequestOperation imageRequestOperationWithRequesturlRequest successUIImage image        Process image amp save              ifoperationQ.operationCount  0                execute completion of Queue code here                          else                 track progress of the queue here and update UIProgressView                  ] codepre  pHowever, I come up with the same issue as I do with KVO.p  pIve thought about using GCD with a dispatch queue using a completion block  so asynchronously dispatch an NSOperationQueue and then execute the completion block but that doesnt solve my issue with regard to keeping track of the queue progress to update UIProgressView.p  pAlso not used p  pcodeAFHttpClient enqueueBatchOfHTTPRequestOperationsNSArray  progressBlockNSUInteger numberOfFinishedOperations, NSUInteger totalNumberOfOperationsprogressBlock completionBlockNSArray operationscompletionBlockcode p  psince my images are coming from a few different URLs rather than one base url.p  pAny suggestions or pointers will be appreciated.

Negative 7989 pIve created an external build system target in my Xcode project and made it a dependency of the main target, so I want this target run before the main target starts building. In this external build system target I simply reference a bash script to run codepod installcode from the SRCROOT dir.p  pAs expected, my new target runs first and codePod installcode runs fine but then the build stops. It does not fail however, it just reports the Build stopped with no issues. The exit code from pod install is 0 so the script should return as successful yet the build stops.p  pDoes anyone know why this may be happeningp

Negative 7989 pIm trying to use Windows Azure Active Directory as an Identity Provider for my MVC 4 app and need to figure out how to implement a user registration functionality. I know that Graph API can be used for updating WAAD. However, from reading a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsazuredn151791.aspx relnofollowhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarywindowsazuredn151791.aspxa Ive got a sense that, in order to use Graph API, a user has to be authenticated through WAAD first. Only then will he receive a token to be used with Graph API. But what if I have an unregistered user who wants to register How do I create an entry for him in WAAD Can I somehow use the Service Principal to get the token, bypassing the user having to log in How would I do that, if thats the casep  pIll be very grateful if you could point me in the right direction and provide me with a set of steps, tutorials and code samples I can use to solve my problem. p

Negative 7989 pI have an codeasynccode method that is a longrunning method that reads a stream and when it finds something fires an eventp  precodepublic static async void GetStreamint id, CancellationToken token codepre  pIt takes a cancellation token because it is create in a new task. Internally it calls codeawaitcode when it reads a streamp  precodevar result  await sr.ReadLineAsync codepre  pNow, I want to convert this to a method that returns an IObservablelt so that I can use this with the reactive extensions. From what Ive read, the best way to do this is using codeObservable.Createcode, and since RX 2.0 now also supports async I can get it all to work with something like thisp  precodepublic static IObservableltMessagegt ObservableStreamint id, CancellationToken token      return Observable.CreateltMessagegt         async IObserverltMessagegt observer gt              codepre  pThe rest of the code inside is the same, but instead of firing events Im calling codeobserver.OnNextcode. But, this feels wrong. For one thing Im mixing CancellationTokens up in there, and although adding the async keyword made it work, is this actually the best thing to do Im calling my ObservableStream like thisp  precodeClient.ObservableStream555404, token.ObserveOnDispatcher.CurrentDispatcher.SubscribeOnTaskPoolScheduler.Default.Subscribem gt Messages.Addm codepre

Negative 7989 pIm sure that there is an answer to this out there, but Im not entirely certain how to properly phrase this question, so my apologies if this is repetitious. p  pI am working on implementing a badgeachievement system for a site. The backend stuff is there, but Im working on the frontend now, and Im basically trying to figure out how to redirect to a sort of Congratulations page when someone gets a new badge. p  pThe congratulations page is going to be a modal, but for simplicities sake, if anyone has an idea of how to trigger an action like this only once when a new Badge is created, that would be a huge help. Right now, when a user performs a given action, say... adding money to their account, a userbadge is created adds a Badge ID to an array. p  pThanks in advancep

Since the two allocators dont compare equal because they have different arenas, the target vector needs to allocate memory and move the values one by one.p  pThe desired behaviour is achieved by changing the equality operator top  precodetemplate ltclass T1, sizet N1, class T2, sizet N2gt bool operatorconst shortallocltT1, N1gtamp x, const shortallocltT2, N2gtamp y noexcept      return N1  N2 ampamp ampx.a  ampy.a  y.a.onheap  codepre  pwhere codeonheapcode checks if the allocator is not using its arena.p  pThis solution looks rather hackish note for example that equality is not symmetric, canwill I shoot myself in the foot by doing this Is there a elegant solutionp

Negative 7989 pOne of my Java applications functionality is to read and parse very frequently almost every 5 minutes an xml file and populate a database table. I have created a cron job to do that. Most of the columns values remain the same but for certain columns there may be a frequent update on the value. I was wondering what is the most efficient way of doing that 1 Delete the table every time and recreate it or 2 Update the table data and specifically the column where a change in the source file has appeared.  The number of rows parsed and persisted every time is about 4000050000. I would assume that around 20003000 rows need to update on every cron job run. I am using JPA to persist data to a mysql server  and I have gone for the first option so far. Obviously for both options the job would execute as a single transaction.p  pAny ideas which one is better and possibly any optimization suggestionsp

Negative 7989 pI have just began learning Core data. When it comes to multithreading, some blogs say that in this case we should use children contexts by creating a context and setting its parent and just invoke the performBlock method. However some other blogs say that we should avoid this approach since it has introduced many bugs. I have just began developing an application that manipulates a large data base and the project manager voted for Core data instead of SQLLite. Could any one please give me some directions. Should i use the children contexts strategy introduced since iOS 5 or is there a better way to perform multithreading with Core Data  Thanks.p

Negative 7989 pI am currently testing some code in cmd, and Im experiencing some problems with relative paths.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHpfaP.png altpicp  pIt is clearly visible that the path is set correctly, furthermore it works as expected under http protocol. I assume theres something thats blocking relative paths in cmd, because if I replace that with an absolute path the file gets included. This however is not efficient as filesystems may change and the use of relative paths is a must. Im really bad with OS stuff so I guess I shouldnt be making any more assumptions.

Negative 7989 pIm in need of a custom codeUIViewcode which is to be used in multiple different codeViewControllerscode. Usually when I create a custom codeUIViewcode, I drag an instance of codeUIViewcode into my codeViewControllercode in storyboard, create a subclass of codeUIViewcode, and point to this subclass in the codeIdentity Inspectorcode for the view. From there, I would connect the UIobjects as outlets to the headerfile of the subclass.p  pThe view I want to make now, is not supposed to be a part of any specific controller, but should be added to any controller that asks for it. A rogue codeUIViewcode. I know I can create the entire codeUIViewcode programmatically, and just create an instance of it, but Id like to have it and design it in my storyboard.p  pIn Storyboard, the only objects Im allowed to drag outside a ViewController, are other ViewControllers.p  pI have never used anything other than Storyboard for iOSdeveloping, but I have come over tutorials which have been using the other mode, emfrom the olden daysem, which looks like what I need. Is it possible to get something similar strongintostrong my storyboard Or would this require its own setupdesign If so, howp  pI was also thinking of solving this with adding a phantom codeUIViewControllercode containing my custom View designing it there, but instantiate it from the other controllers, but this sounds so hacky.. p  pId like to do this with a codeUITableViewCellcode as well, but I guess that would have the same solution.p

Negative 7989 pI am using Google AppEngines Channel API. I am having some issue to restart the lost connection due to the users network connection. When you loose the internet connection, channel call onError but it will not call onClose. As far as JavaScript object is concerned, the channel socket is open. p  pHow do you handle lost connection due to the internet issue I am thinking of 1 by trigger to close the channel and reopen it when RPC unrelated to the channel somewhere in the application succeeds for the first time which indicates the internet is alive again or 2 Use timer that runs all the time and pings the server for network status which was the point of introducing the long polling to avoid consuming unwanted resource this way. Any other ideas would be great.p  pstrongObservationstrong When the internet connection is dead, onError is called in incremental interval 10sec, 20sec, 40sec twice. Once the internet connection is back, channel does not resume connection. It stops working without any indication that it is dead.p  pThanks.p

Negative 7989 pI am trying to use codeunix2doscode on a group of C source code files.

Negative 7989 pI have a question, my app is a short video share application just like vine, but now I encounter questions when used in subway or some places with weak signals, it will fail sometimes and have poor user experience. p  pI am a newbie for network programming and iOS. I did a lot search on Google, and have some general sense, let me sum up my finds and pls help to give some suggestions for it.p  pMy requirement is1. support resume when uploading interrupt. 2. can success upload in weak signal. Actually I do NOT need to think about the realtime problems or how to compress the video, just think the video as a file is totally ok. BTW the server is a REST style, I use post to upload datas.p  pQuestionsp  ol lipwhich is the better way for my requirement, using streamstream NOT mean live stream video just data stream like NSOutStreamampNSInputStream, just play the video after all of it has uploaded, NOT the live stream video playing and downloading at meantime or divide the whole file into several chunks and upload chunk by chunk. someone said, using stream is good for resource efficiency since the stream will read files into memory and control the size of the buffer and after setup connection with server we use delegate to control the failure so easy to use.  Upload chunk by chunk is good at speed, I have puzzled with this statement, upload by chunks after successfully upload one chunk we need to release the connection resources and setup another connection then do upload I think this will spend time to do these preparation stuffs.pli lipIf upload by chunks which size should be good, one video file is almost 1M bytes, someone said 8k is a safe choice, but......pli lipsince the app needs to adapt to different signal strength, is there any way for example the chunk size is depended on the bandwidth or other wayspli lipIs there any private API already support resume uploading interrupt or is there any apple api can support this, my app needs to run on iOS 5 and above so can NOT use NSURLSessionpli lipConcurrent uploading is a way to speed up If so how to implement or any API availablepli ol  pThank you in advance for helping a newbie like me. Thank you very much.p

Negative 7989 pHi I have a desktop server running Windows 7 and S.S. 2008 R2. Its been running a long time with stability. I recently purchased a laptop running Windows 8.1 and S.S. 2012BI. Historically I have done all of my development PythonS.S. SPROCs, etc on the Windows 7 desktop. Eventually S.S. 2008 R2 will be ugpraded to S.S. 2012. Right now, I want the freedom to continue my development on either and not worry about manually copying backforth.  Ultimately I want to set up some form of replication. However I have more immediate problems.p  pTo start, I would like to just get a copy of the database from the S.S. 2008 R2 instance copied to the S.S. 2012BI instance. I cannot seem to get the file sharing between the two computersinstances correct to allow one instance to access the other. Here is what I have attempted and the obstacles in front of me, to just get a copy of the S.S. 2008 R2 DB copied to the 2012BI instance.p  pFYI there is a successful home group setup between the 2 windows instances. For example, I can see the pictures on the Win7 box from the Win8 laptop. I have also set up a sharenetwork drive on the Win7 box pointing to my S.S. 2008 R2 DB Backupp  p1  I went into S.S. 2012 SS Mgmt Studio, highlighted Database, right clicked, selected Restore Database, walked through the dialog box under source, selected device then hit the button with 3 dots, it brings up select backup devices, hit add looking for the mapped network drive pointing to the Win7 box with the 2008 R2 backup. PROBLEM The network drive will not show up.p  p2  On the Win 7 box I tried the copy database wizard  2008 R2 can see the laptop but after that and by hitting the next button, it eventually times out with Failed to connect to server  and Login failed for user LaptopGuest Microsoft SQL Server, Error 18456 BTW this was AFTER I temporarily shut down the firewall on the laptopcopy destination.p  pAgain, my first objective is just a manual copy from 2008R2 to 2012BI. If someone can coach me on connectivitypermissionsetc I would appreciate.p  pAfter I get a copy set up, I would appreciate some guidance on the appropriate replication scheme to employ and how to set it up. I would like to be able work on the 2008R2 instance and at anytime be able to grab my laptop SS 2012BI and be assured it has all of the most recent 2008R2 changes. Then after I finish my work on the laptop 2012BI have the laptop changes replicate back to the desktop 2008R2...but this will eventually also be 2012BIp  pThanks in abvancep

Negative 7989 pFor FragmentActivity communication, a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingbasicsfragmentscommunicating.html relnofollowthisa is the suggested way of doing it, by using a listener.p  pIn my case I have two fragments and a button at each and I would like them to do the exact same thing when pressed.p  pShould I create a separate listener class that the Activity implements and then instantiate a listener in each fragment or there is a better design that I am not aware ofp  pEDITp  pI am sorry, I probably didnt communicate that properly. I am not looking for communication between fragments. I have a Fragment A with a buttonA and a Fragment B with a buttonB. When I click on buttonA, there is a listener in my Activity and method codedoSomethingcode is called. Now I want buttonB calling codedoSomethingcode too. Should I A create a second listener and have the activity implement that too, B create one separate listener class and use this one for both or C a better choice  p

Negative 7989 pCurrently working on a page for a project and I have my code for collapsing the navbar when the screen is adjusted for mobile. Everything works the way it should, my only problem is the position of the icon bar. Normally the icon bar is in the right hand corner of the page when it collapses, but is it possible to have it on the left hand side instead. I have searched around and I can find plenty of info on changing the icon image, at what point the navbar collapses, etc., but nothing on moving it to the other side of the screen.p  pThis is just a basic navbar code with a collapse feature, but I need the icon on the left not the right.p  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt   ltheadgt     lttitlegtBootstrap 101 Templatelttitlegt       ltlink typetextcss hrefcssbootstrap.min.css relstylesheetgt     ltlink typetextcss hrefcssstyle.css relstylesheetgt     ltlink hrefhttpnetdna.bootstrapcdn.comfontawesome4.0.3cssfontawesome.css relstylesheetgt   ltheadgt    ltbodygt      ltdiv classnavbar navbardefault navbarfixedtopgt         ltdiv classcontainergt             ltdiv classnavbarheadergt                 ltbutton typebutton classnavbartoggle datatogglecollapse datatarget.navbarcollapsegt                     ltspan classiconbargtltspangt                     ltspan classiconbargtltspangt                     ltspan classiconbargtltspangt                 ltbuttongt                 lta href classnavbarbrandgtPracticeltagt             ltdivgt              ltdiv classnavbarcollapse collapsegt                 ltul classnav navbarnavgt                     ltligtlta hrefindex.htmlgtHomeltagtltligt                     ltligtlta hrefabout.htmlgtAboutltagtltligt                     ltligtlta hreffeature.htmlgtFeatureltagtltligt                     ltli classdropdowngt                     lta hreftutorials classdropdowntoggle datatoggledropdowngtTutorialsltb classcaretgtltbgtltagt                     ltul classdropdownmenugt                         ltligtlta hrefgtBootstrap Tutorialsltagtltligt                         ltligtlta hrefgtPHP Tutorialsltagtltligt                         ltligtlta hrefgtJava Tutorialsltagtltligt                         ltligtlta hrefgtCSS Tutorialsltagtltligt                     ltulgt                     ltligt                     ltligtlta hrefcontact.htmlgtContactltagtltligt                 ltulgt             ltdivgt          ltdivgt     ltdivgt codepre

Negative 7989 pI have 3 tabs that come into play for the particular issue that I am trying to automate using VBA.p  pForm tab  Users select from a drop down list up to 10 different entities that they need access to Range A25A34p  pFLS Hiearchy This tab is a hiearchy of all of the entities within the company beginning with level 1 highest  parent level to level 10 lowest child level.  Range AD Column A is the level, B is the entity which will match the various entities selected in dropdown on Form tab, Column C is Entity Description, Column D is the Sec Class which needs to be copied over to sheet 1.  p  pSheet1  This tab is for the admin and is to be used to Find the necessary security classes from the FLS Hiearchy tab based upon the entities selected in the form tab. Range A1J1.  Security classes are to be copied beneath each variable as derived from the Form tab up to 10 entities, correlating to Column J on Sheet1.p  pI know that I need to create a loop of some kind to accomplish this.  In a nutshell the VBA script needs to identify the entities up to 10 from the Form tab, paste them in the Range A1J1 as necessary, and then go through a loop where it takes the corresponding entities beginning with A1 and find the entities in the FLS Hieararchy tab.  Once it finds each entity in the Hierarchy tab it needs to determine its level column A on Hierarchy tab.  If the level is level 6 for example, the VBA script needs to grab the security class for that line where the entity was found and then grab the security class for the entities below it until it finds the next level 6 security class and then it needs to stop there go up one row to not include the next level 6.  In this example if you find a level 6 and the next entity below it is also a 6 the VBA script only needs to grab the one security class column d for the first variable.p  pBelow is what I have so far, but I am obviously needing a lot more help to finish.p  precodeSub SecurityClasses   SecurityClasses Macro  Based off entity selected in Form tab determine the security classes needed for user.

Negative 7989 pI have written a python program that needs to run for multiple days at a time, because of the constant collection of data.  Previously I had no issues running this program for months at a time.  I recently made some updates to the program, and now after around 12 hours I get the dreaded out of memory killer. The dmesg output is the followingp  precode[9084334.914808] Out of memory Kill process 2276 python2.7 score 698 or sacrifice child [9084334.914811] Killed process 2276 python2.7 totalvm13279000kB, anonrss4838164kB, filerss8kB codepre  pBesides just general python coding, the main change made to the program was the addition of a multiprocessing Queue.  This is the first time I have ever used this feature, so I am not sure if this might be the cause of the issue.  The purpose of the Queue in my program is to be able to make dynamic changes in a parallel process. The Queue is initiated in the main program and in continually being monitored in the parallel process.  A simplified version of how I am doing this in the parallel process is the following with q being the Queuep  precodewhile1      if q.empty         None      else         fr  q.get          Additional code      time.sleep1 codepre  pThe dynamic changes to q do not happen very often so majority of the time q.empty will be true, but the loop is there to be ready as soon as changes are made.  My question is, would running this code for multiple hours at a time cause the memory to eventually run low With the while loop being pretty short and running basically non stop, I was thinking this might be an problem.  If this could be the cause of the problem, does anybody have any suggestions on how to improve the code so the out of memory killer doesnt get calledp  pThank you very much.  p

Negative 7989 pCurrently in my project I am making a virtual abstract base class and three derived class. In the base classs pure virtual function is used in the derived classes to create an equation that will either add or subtract with two variables. My problem is that I also have to include a function to check if one of the variables put into the function is negative that will throw an exception if it is. Currently I put these functions and the exceptions into the derived classes but to me it seems a little redundant. So I am wondering if it is allowed to put the function to check to see if the variable Im checking is negative and have the exception thrown both in the abstract base classp

Negative 7989 pAs per kernel docs, coderequestthreadedirqcode is used to split it in two parts, irqhandler checks whether the interrupt originates from the device. If yes it needs to disable the interrupt on the device and return codeIRQWAKETHREADcode which will wake up the handler thread and run codethreadfncode.p  pBut I found some code register interrupt, using coderequestthreadedirqcode while passing codeNULLcode as codeirqhandlercode and they keep complete functionality in codethreadfncode.p  pSo my doubt is why we use coderequestthreadedirqcode in that case, while we can easily use coderequestirqcode, which behaves same for the mentioned scenario.p

Negative 7989 pI am using Ransack to provide data filters.p  pThe main User model has the following association codeuser hasmany trips, through registrationscodep  pThe basic search conditions such as codeusers namexyz and trips nameabccode works fine.p  pBut most of our conditions work on negation, such as codeusers namexyz and trips nameabc and trips name  defcode doesnt work as expected.p  pWe are trying to find people who have gone on ABC trip, but not on DEF trip.  But the SQL generated for the above query generates this clause codeWHERE trips.name LIKE ABC AND trips.name NOT LIKE DEFcode.  This obviously doesnt work as the users table is leftinnerjoined with this clause and the trip.ids are generated for rows with name like ABC and not like DEF.p  pHow does one do this using Ransackp  pUPDATEp  pIf the search query is Users who have gone on trip named ABC, the SQL generated is fine codeSELECT DISTINCT users. FROM users LEFT OUTER JOIN registrations ON registrations.userid  users.id LEFT OUTER JOIN trips ON trips.id  registrations.batchid WHERE trips.name LIKE ABCcodep  pIf the search query is Users who have gone on trips ABC and DEF, how does one do it  I tried two different approachesp  ol liTwo separate conditions with name  ABC and name  DEF.  This was done with matches all.  The SQL gave 0 results obviously as this was generated codeSELECT DISTINCT users. FROM users LEFT OUTER JOIN registrations ON registrations.userid  users.id LEFT OUTER JOIN trips ON trips.id  registrations.batchid WHERE trips.name LIKE ABC AND trips.name LIKE DEFcodeli liI tried matches any instead.  That gave this codeSELECT DISTINCT users. FROM users LEFT OUTER JOIN registrations ON registrations.userid  users.id LEFT OUTER JOIN trips ON trips.id  registrations.batchid WHERE trips.name LIKE ABC OR trips.name LIKE DEFcodeli ol  pThe 2nd query results were those users who had either gone on ABC or DEF.p  pTo add to this, we wanted this query Users who have gone on ABC but not on DEF.  I tried this with two conditions matches all trip.name  ABC and trips.name not like DEF.  This was the SQL generated codeSELECT DISTINCT users. FROM users LEFT OUTER JOIN registrations ON registrations.userid  users.id LEFT OUTER JOIN trips ON trips.id  registrations.batchid WHERE trips.name LIKE ABC AND trips.name NOT LIKE DEFcodep  pThe above query returned people who had gone on trip ABC.  It didnt filter out people who had done DEF as the query is obviously wrong.p

Negative 7989 pI use Django 1.6 with a PostgreSQL 9.3.2 backend for my web application.

Negative 7989 pIve just started playing around with UI router, mainly because of the ability to declare nested states and named views.p  pHere is a simplified example of how I have configured a combination of the twop  precodestateProvider.statepage,    abstract true,   templateUrl page.html  .statepage.stream,    url stream,   controller StreamCtrl,   views      content        templateUrl streamcontent.html     ,     header        templateUrl streamheader.html          .statepage.notifications,    url notifications,   controller NotifsCtrl,   views      content        templateUrl notifscontent.html     ,     header        templateUrl notifsheader.html          codepre  pI have declared the codepagecode view to be abstract because its only purpose is to hold two other views, the variable codeheadercode and codecontentcode, alongside navigation which is static across pages.p  precodelt page.html gt ltnavgt...ltnavgt ltdiv uiviewheadergtltdivgt ltdiv uiviewcontentgtltdivgt codepre  pThe routing and plugging in templates works as expected, the navigation stays static when navigating to codestreamcode or codenotificationscode, and the header and content views change. However, the controller declared on codepage.streamcode and codepage.notificationscode does not get initiated.p  pMy first intuition would be that declaring a controller alongside a state configurations views object would result in the controller beging set on the entire page, so that the header and content would share the controllers codescopecode.p  pDeclaring the controller on the codepagecode state achieves this, but using codecontrollerProvidercode does not give me access to enough information to decide which controller to usep  precodestateProvider.statepage,    abstract true,   templateUrl page.html,   controllerProvider function stateParams       How do I know which state I am in, notifications or stream     return      codepre  pI have tried to play around with the different notation absoluterelative when declaring the view names, and I had some luck with the followingp  precodestateProvider.statepage.stream,    url stream,   views       I understand that this targets the parent page which holds both header and content             controller StreamController     ,     page ...     header ...     codepre  pThis does indeed set the StreamController on the entire page, but results in both of the templates being missing, as if codepage.htmlcode was never loaded.p  pWhere should I set the controller on each of my page substates so that each view in the substate shares the scope of the controllerp

Negative 7989 pOkay, deep breath, this may be a bit verbose, but better to err on the side of detail than lack thereof...p  pSo, in one sentence, my goal is to find the intersection of about 22 300400mb files based on 3 of 139 attributes.p  pNow a bit more background. The files range from 300400mb, consisting of 139 columns and typically in the range of 400,000600,000 rows. I have three particular fields I want to join on  a unique ID, and latitudelongitude with a bit of a tolerance if possible. The goal is to determine which of these recored existed across certain ranges of files. Going worst case, that will mean performing a 22 file intersection. p  pSo far, the following has failedp  pI tried using MySQL to perform the join. This was back when I was only looking at 7 years. Attempting the join on 7 years using INNER JOIN about 7 times... e.g. t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON condition INNER JOIN t3 ON condition ... etc, I let it run for about 48 hours before the timeout ended it. Was it likely to actually still be running, or does that seem overly long Despite all the suggestions I found to enable better multithreading and more RAM usage, I couldnt seem to get the cpu usage above 25. If this is a good approach to pursue, any tips would be greatly appreciated.p  pI tried using ArcMap. I converted the CSVs to tables and imported them into a file geodatabase.  I ran the intersection tool on two files, which took about 4 days, and the number of records returned was more than twice the number of input features combined. Each file had about 600,000 records. The intersection returned with 2,000,0000 results. In other cases, not all records were recognized by ArcMap. ArcMap says there are 5,000 records, when in reality there are 400,000p  pI tried combining in python. Firstly, I can immediately tell RAM is going to be an issue. Each file takes up roughly 2GB of RAM in python when fully opened. I do this withp  precodef1  [row for row in csv.readeropenfile1.csv, rU] f2  [row for row in csv.readeropenfile2.csv, rU] joinOut  csv.writeropenIntersect.csv, wb uniqueIDs  set[row[uniqueIDIndex] for row in f1].extend[row[uniqueIDIndex] for row in f2] for uniqueID in uniqueIDs     f1rows  [row for row in f1 if row[uniqueIDIndex]  uniqueID]     f2rows  [row for row in f2 if row[uniqueIDIndex]  uniqueID]     if lenf1rows  0 or lenf2rows  0         Not an intersect     else          Strings, split at decimal, if integer and first 3 places          after decimal are equal, they are spatially close enough         f1lat  f1rows[0][latIndex].split.         f1long  f1rows[0][longIndex].split.         f2lat  f2rows[0][latIndex].split.         f2long  f2rows[0][longIndex].split.         if f1lat[0]f1lat[1][3]  f2lat[0]f2lat[1][3] and f1long[0]f1long[1][3]  f2long[0]f2long[1][3]             joinOut.writerows[f1rows[0], f2rows[0]]           codepre  pObviously, this approach requires that the files being intersected are available in memory. Well I only have 16GB of RAM available and 22 files would need 44GB of RAM. I could change it so that instead, when each uniqueID is iterated, it opens and parses each file for the row with that uniqueID. This has the benefit of reducing the footprint to almost nothing, but with hundreds of thousands of unique IDs, that could take an unreasonable amount of time to execute.p  pSo, here I am, asking for suggestions on how I can best handle this data. I have an i73770k at 4.4Ghz, 16GB RAM, and a vertex4 SSD, rated at 560 MBs read speed. Is this machine even capable of handling this amount of datap  pAnother venue Ive thought about exploring is an Amazon EC2 cluster and Hadoop. Would that be a better idea to investigatep

Negative 7989 pFirst of all, I apologize if Im missing some fundamental understandings of the apple builddeployment model, Im very new to this.  p  pA little background  The app Im involved with is an appstoredistributed app, but the company likes to be able distribute beta builds internally andor to select customers before publishing to the appstore.  The adhoc distribution model doesnt really work for this device ids are not known ahead of time so we use the InHouse distribution model for this.  That means in the developer console we have 2 different organizations  one that does the appstore build, and an enterprise one that does the inhouse build.  p  pThe app itself is a thinish client which interacts with a backend server for a significant amount of its functionality.  On the server side we have the production environment and we also have a public prelaunch environment.  The client can be configured to use either one of these environments both beta and publiclyreleased client builds can consume either the production or prelaunch serversp  pThis all works fine.p  pBut now, were adding push notifications.  It seems straight forward  when the app connects to 1 environment it registers with it, and unregisters with the other...and thus the app only gets notifications from the environment it is or was last connected to.  However on the serverconfig side I dont know how to make it work.  Because apple doesnt support both inhouse and appstore profiles for the same organization these 2 builds are done by different organizations and seen as different apps  how can I get these 2 applications to be recognized as the same app, with the ability to send notifications to either of them using the same key from the server sidep

Also, the codenewInstancecode method wasnt feasible because of the constructor requiring arguments. While this still was possible, it required too much reflection codegetConstructorcode and loss of type safety for my taste of a clean approach.p  pIm perfectly satisfied to hear that what Im trying to achieve cant be accomplished in any recommendable way.

With this method I would have to use the same constructor in all implementations of the interface.p  pThis made me think about the builder pattern. Which still arrives at the same caveat as the interface would need to define the building methods and thus again would have to make requirements for how all implementations have to be built.p  pIs there any other way for delayed construction That is, a means that would enable me to inject an instance of the implementation I would like to use codepublic DummyClassInterfaceType implementationcode but only construct or build or initialise it inside the loop where it then would return copies of itself.p  pBut then again. I increasingly feel that what Im trying to achieve wont be possible. Or that it shouldnt be done because of unjustified additional complexity or imposed restrictions. I might then rather accept the direct dependency of this class on the implementation and thank drewmoore for her insights.p

Negative 7989 pIn an ASP.NET MVC application using entity framework, I have an Edit view where I am updating some properties on one of my entity models. Id like to put an add button for one of the properties if the user wants to add a new property of that type but without deleting the older entry, I understand this requires a List of those type of properties. When I click this add button, using codeAjax.ActionLinkcode will retrieve a new codeHtml.EditorForcode helper from a partial view and add it to the current form. p  pCurrently my ActionMethod looks like its only updating the fields that are already there, what kind of logic can I add to say if this is a new property, then db.Addp  pheres what my method looks like nowp  precode[HttpPost] [ValidateAntiForgeryToken] public ActionResult TimeSeriesDataListltTimeSeriesDatagt List1      int empid  List1[0].EmployeeID     if ModelState.IsValid              foreach TimeSeriesData ln in List1                      db.Entryln.State  EntityState.Modified                  db.SaveChanges         return RedirectToActionEdit, new  id  empid           return new EmptyResult  codepre  pId like to add logic somewhere inside the foreach loop and say if the item in the list is a new item, then codedb.MyModel.List.Additemcode but Im not sure how to check if the list item is newp  pwould it be something like p  precodeif newproperty.propertyid  null   db.MyModel.List.Addnewproperty  codepre  pPlease let me know if you need more clarificationp  pstrongemEDITemstrongp  pOr another way to ask my question is how can I check if the item already exists in the database,p  pmodelsp  precodesummarized class Employee   int EmployeeID getset  ListltTimeSeriesDatagt TimeSeriesData getset  class TimeSeriesData   int TimeSeriesDataID get set  int EmployeeID getset  string Value getset  [ForeignKeyEmployeeID]  public Employee Employee  get set   codepre

Negative 7989 pI need to implement a very simple web app which is basically a form. The web app should support View, Create, Update and Delete operations on the form. What I have only is an API that allows me to fetch the form data from the database, insert into the database, delete .. etc. The requirements is to only use javascript for my web app, so I cant use php or a backend for the web app since I only need to use the API. The web server has no web frameworks installed so thats why I can only use javascript. p  pCurrently I implemented the HTML interface for the form and wrote the javascript code for CRUD to communicate with the server. The main problem is that Im not able to think of the way to make Insertion and Edit operations with the form HTML template. p  pOne way I though about to solve this is that once a user clicks on an Edit link, then I make a javascript redirect to the template with a URL that contains the form id as a GET request parameter. Then I use javascript to parse that id and send an ajax request to the server and populate the form with the data. But my problem is that I dont know the followingp  ol lipI dont know if this is actually the correct and right way to do what Im trying to do.pli lipI dont know how to make the template aware if it should be rendered for an Edit operation or an Insert operation. Is that possible to do with javascript Like to check if the request is for edit or insertion and then render the template based on that Since I will need to include a javascript script file for all the pages of my web app, then how to check for particularly the template page and then make the decision if its for insertion or editpli ol

Negative 7989 pHow can I get NSTableView to always show the same columns regardless of the horizontal scroller position In the rightmost visible column I have custom cell views. I want the horizontal scroller to control what is being drawn in these custom views. The vertical scrolling should work normally.p  pI have tried several approaches without much success. For example, I can control the knob proportion of the horizontal scroller by making the table view wider, or by making the scroll view think its document view is actually wider than it is. One way is subclassing NSClipView and overriding documentRect as followsp  precodeNSRectdocumentRect      NSRect rect  [super documentRect]     rect.size.width  [[NSApp delegate] hiddenRangeWidth]     return rect  codepre  pHowever, while the scroller knob looks as it should and I can drag it right without moving the table view, when I start scrolling in another direction, the knob returns to the left edge. I also have the problem that I cant get the horizontal scroller to appear automatically. This happens with the original classes as well, not just with my custom clip view. Could these problems be relatedp  pI have also tried replacing the document view with a custom view that acts as a proxy between the clip view and the table view. Its drawRect calls the table views drawRect. However, nothing is drawn. I guess this is because the table view now has no superview. If the table view were added to this proxy view as a subview, it would move with it. How would I make it stationary in horizontal axisp  pSo, to reiteratep  ol liWhat is the best way to make a table view scrollable, while always showing the same columns regardless of the horizontal scroller positionli liWhat is the best way to get the scroller position and knob proportion Should I add an observer for the NSViewBoundsDidChangeNotification from NSClipViewli ol

Negative 7989 pMorning folks.p  pThis problem is very isolated but very annoying. It only happens with one customer I do work for, and can happen when creating new datasets or amending existing ones, but doesnt happen every time.p  pSo lets start with a new dataset. I rightclick and Add Dataset, I give the dataset a name, select the data source and then select Stored Procedure. This is where the fun begins. I start to type the SP name and BOOM, Report Builder crashes. I know I can just pick off the list but in the case of this client, the list of SPs is massive, so starting to type the name narrows down the list. p  pThis can also happen if I amended the name of an SP within an existing dataset.p  pIt has to be something to do with configuration as this doesnt happen with any of my other customers. The only difference with this site is they use Citrix but I cant see how that would affect this.p  pSo, Report Builder 3.0 connecting to a SQL Server 2008 R2 instance. Any suggestionsp  pThanks in advance p

Negative 7989 pIve inherited a project that uses Kendo, and Im still learning its basics. A feature Im working on entails getting JSON data from the server and using it to display something in a Web page. For this Ill use a dataSource, call its read function on the appropriate URL, and specify a callback to render the data but Im unsure whether to use view or data to get the JSON data from the dataSource. They appear to serve very similar purposes. Which one is appropriate if Im using a simple callback to render data from the server, and whats the differencep

Negative 7989 pIm trying to make a watchfolder application using Delphi 2010. On the main form I added 2 listbox and a timer. I list all files from a specific folder. At every 5 seconds i perform a check over the files from a listbox to see which file is still in use. Listbox1 holds the files that are in use and listbox2 holds the files that are not in use. If there is a file that is being usedex it is still being copied to the folder i add it to listbox1. If the files from that folder that i monitor are not in use then I add them to listbox2. The problem is that I perform a loop over listbox2 in order to send all the files listed to a ftp for i0 to listbox2.items.count1 do ..... If i add one more file to listbox2 while performing the loop I get the List index out of bounds How can i add an item to listbox2 loop while performing the loop Thanks a lot Any other suggestion regarding the watchfolder ideeap

Negative 7989 pIm looking to implement a solution where I can query the Mongoose Database on a regular interval and then store the results to serve to my clients. p  pIm assuming this will reduce my response time when my users pull the collection. p  pI attempted to implement this plan by creating an empty global object and then writing a function that queries the db and then stores the results as the global object mentioned previously. At the end of the function I setTimeout for 60 seconds and then ran the function again. I call this function the first time the server controller gets called when the app is first run. p  pI then set my clients up so that when they requested the collection, it would first look to see if the global object exists, and if so return that as the response. I figured this would cut my 710 second queries down to lt 1 sec.p  pIn my novice thinking I assumed that Nodejs being singlethreaded something like this could work quite well  but it just seemed to eat up all my RAM and cause fatal errors. p  pAm I on the right track with my thinking or is it better to query the db every time people pull the collection p  pHere is the code in question p  precodevar allLeads    var getAllLeads  function     allLeads       console.logGetting All Leads...

So I have successfully write a demo that takes a group of UIView and highlights them changes their backgroundColor sequentially.  p  pHaving read Andrew Fuchss response to the question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3849460bestwaytoperformseveralsequentialuiviewanimations38516723851672Best Way to Perform Several Sequential UIView Animationsa which referenced a hrefhttpxibxor.comobjectivecuiviewanimationwithoutnestedhell relnofollowMultiple UIView Animations Without Nested Blocksap  pHowever, when I substitute UILabel for UIView in my code, it all falls over and their is no animation, the change happens instantly. Can anyone tell me what am I doing wrong UILabel is a subclass of UIView so I would have expected properties that work in UIView to work in UILabel. In Apples View Programming Guide for iOS  Animation is states that backgroundColor can be animated. So I have gone back to basics, written some test code and discovered that for a UIView I can happily animate its backgroundColor, alpha and center position. Whereas UILabel alpha property and center position can be successfully animated but it backgroundColor and textColor cannot.

Negative 7989 pIm using AWS to host some web applications. We have several small scale applications and are in the middle of initial development, so at any point an application can be in alphabetademoproduction. Thankfully, production is being handled by another team. p  pIm using haproxy for my load balancer. So my arch design isp  pHaproxy Server  Backend Servers  NAT Serverp  pMy question is, on the haproxy server, should I have all routing rules located solely in that haproxy server, or should I run just the basic routing rules eg, is this demotestalpha, and then let the backend servers route the specific URLs to the proper applications dont worry, example in a sec.p  pSo, to give this some perspective. We have applications A, B and C. We currently have three stages for these applications. Test, Demo, and staging.p  precodeHaproxyServer gt TestServer gt apps A, B, and C              gt DemoServer gt apps A, B, and C              gt StagingServer gt apps A, B, OR, C  codepre  pyou would navigate to Test server by something.test.myDomain.comappNamefoo and you could navigate to demo by    something.demo.myDomain.comappNamfoo etc.p  pHopefully you get the idea. So not only do I need to route to the correct server, but then, at that server, I need to route to the correct application thats running.p  pIm currently achieving this by having all the rules in the single haproxy server. But I know I can run a second haproxy on the app server itself. Should I split up the work and have two haproxy servers, or is it acceptable to have a single haproxy serverp

Negative 7989 pWe are facing a challenge in the company. We have an existing service running for a client and the hardware is in their permises. We are using mySQL as database. The service is some voice based stuff as we are a telecom company... Now, the client has new policy stating that suppliers should no more use mySQL and instead will use MSSQL or Oracle... inside their datacenter. Switching to another database is simply impossible for us now due to all development efforts and time.p  pMy question is, do you have any idea of how we could manage the situationp  pKindly.p

I do this with the codenamecode attributep  precodeltinput typecheckbox namechoices[]gt codepre  pThis is good because I can simply go down the list of codechoicescode and deal with whatever is in the array instead of checking for a myriad of different names of inputs that were possibly selected.p  pWe also use basic HTML to group radio buttons together. So we can have a group of radio buttons for MaleFemale as well as Old MemberNew Member and not have them conflict meaning, you can only choose either emeitherem male or female as well as emeitherem newold memberthe page doesnt force a single choice out of all 4 of those. I do this with the codenamecode attributep  precodeltinput typeradio namesexgtMale ltinput typeradio namesexgtFemale ltinput typeradio namemembershipgtOld Member ltinput typeradio namemembershipgtNew Member codepre  pSo my issue is, how do I do both at once I need to have separate groups of radio buttons, but still want to pass everything as an array, but the problem is I use the codenamecode attribute for both If I name it the arrayname, I cant differentiate between the radiogroups. If I differentiate, I lose the arrayp

Negative 7989 pI managed using barcode scanner successfully in my WPF project using a keyboard hook as follows I skip some details, but basically, I can rely on the fact that I know which keyboard is my scanner.p  precode ltsummarygt  Add this KeyboardHook to a window  ltsummarygt  ltparam namewindowgtThe window to add toltparamgt public void AddHookWindow window    if form  null     throw new ArgumentNullExceptionwindow   if mHwndSource  null     throw new InvalidOperationExceptionHook already present    WindowInteropHelper w  new WindowInteropHelperwindow   IntPtr hwnd  w.Handle   mHwndSource  HwndSource.FromHwndhwnd   if mHwndSource  null     throw new ApplicationExceptionFailed to receive window source    mHwndSource.AddHookWndProc    RAWINPUTDEVICE[] rid  new RAWINPUTDEVICE[1]    rid[0].usUsagePage  0x01   rid[0].usUsage  0x06   rid[0].dwFlags  RIDEVINPUTSINK   rid[0].hwndTarget  hwnd    if RegisterRawInputDevicesrid, uintrid.Length, uintMarshal.SizeOfrid[0]     throw new ApplicationExceptionFailed to register raw input devices.  codepre  pThe approach then processes WMINPUT messages to retrieve information about any keyboard events that occur and handles the event accordingly if it is coming from the Barcode scanner that is already known.p  pNow the thing is that in Winforms I should not use hooks but override WndProc as stated a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7233610hwndmessagehookinwinformsherea, but I am somehow struggling to understand how I can use WndProc as I need to knowp  pa what event I really need to handle in the WndProc methodp  pb how I can identify the device that fired the eventp  pAny help would be very appreciated Cheersp

Negative 7989 pIn C strings are immutable and managed. In theory that would mean the concatenation of any strings codeAcode and codeBcode would cause the allocation of a new buffer however this is all pretty obfuscated. When you concatenate with the identity the empty string the reference maintains intact. Is this a compile time optimization or is the overloaded assignment operator making the decision to not realloc at runtime Furthermore, how does the runtimecompiler handle codes2codes valueallocation when I modify the value of codes1code My program would indicate that the memory at the original address of codes1code remains intact and codes2code continues pointing there while a relloc occurs for the new value and then codes1code is pointed there, is this an accurate description of what happens under the coversp  pExample programp  precode    static void Mainstring[] args              string s1  Some random text I chose         string s2  s1         string s3  s2          Console.WriteLineObject.ReferenceEqualss1, s2  true          s1  s1            Console.WriteLineObject.ReferenceEqualss1, s2  true         Console.WriteLines2          s1  s1   something else          Console.WriteLineObject.ReferenceEqualss1, s2  false cause s1 got reallocd         Console.WriteLineObject.ReferenceEqualss2, s3         Console.WriteLines2          Console.ReadKey      codepre

Negative 7989 pI posted on friday regarding this issue and received no response, however since then some updates have occurred which might affect whether people have an answer to my question or not.p  pIm trying to deploy an MVC website to Azure, and in this particular project the web deploy receives a codeSocket Error 10054code and gives up after 10 attempts saying it was codeUnable to write data to the transport connectioncode. It makes varying progress in between the socket failures but never completes within the 10 attempts.p  pI have since had a play around with other projects which are deployed to different url locations within this same Azure Account and they deploy fine I think this means the problem is not on my end, i.e. port 8172 is open and deployment can be achieved with my current local settings.p  pWhat are the problems that can cause this socket error 10054 I saw somewhere that I should enable the Allow untrusted certificate option when deploying but I cant find that option within VS 2013.p  pAny ideas are welcome please, This issue is driving me mad, it seems theres a real mixed bag of solution ideas which have worked for others but not me.p  pJKp

I think both problems are related, so I wanted to sort out the ffmpeg first.p  pI think the problem might have to do with the fact Im working with Canopy in Windows 8 64bit, which pretty much hegemonized my path variable and broke some things along the way e.g. I cant open IDLE since I installed Canopy, didnt tried to fix that yet. As I fixed things along the way I found at least 3 distinct path variables, all of which I updated windows advanced settings path set manually, windows console path set via console with setx, and sys.path set or checked at runtime, adding codeCffmpegbincode, where ffmpeg effectively is. Regardless I sort out the problem or not, I would like to learn which of these environment variables are relevant for what, I find it very confusing.p  pThe code is the following p  precode  coding utf8  import sys import numpy as np from matplotlib import pyplot as plt from matplotlib import animation plt.rcParams[animation.ffmpegpath]  rCffmpegbin if rCffmpegbin not in sys.path sys.path.appendrCffmpegbin  fig  plt.figure ax  plt.axesxlim0, 2, ylim2, 2 line,  ax.plot[], [], lw2  def init     line.setdata[], []     return line,  def animatei     x  np.linspace0, 2, 1000     y  np.sin2  np.pi  x  0.01  i     line.setdatax, y     return line,  anim  animation.FuncAnimationfig, animate, initfuncinit, frames200, interval20, blitTrue plt.show   This case generates Windows err Access Denied FFwriter  animation.FFMpegWriter  anim.saverCbasicanimation.mp4, writer  FFwriter, fps30   This case generates UnicodeDecodeErrorascii codec cant decode byte 0xa0 in position 3  anim.saverCanimation.gif, writerimagemagick, fps30 codepre  pThe traceback for codeanim.saverCbasicanimation.mp4, writer  FFwriter, fps30code p  precoderun CUsersYahvehDocumentsVladInvestigacionanimation saving.py  WindowsError                              Traceback most recent call last CUsersYahvehDocumentsVladInvestigacionanimation saving.py in ltmodulegt      27  This case generates Windows err Access Denied      28 FFwriter  animation.FFMpegWriter gt 29 anim.saverCbasicanimation.mp4, writer  FFwriter, fps30      30       31  This case generates UnicodeDecodeErrorascii codec cant decode byte 0xa0 in position 3  CUsersYahvehAppDataLocalEnthoughtCanopyUserlibsitepackagesmatplotlibanimation.pyc in saveself, filename, writer, fps, dpi, codec, bitrate, extraargs, metadata, extraanim, savefigkwargs     759          since GUI widgets are gone.

Negative 7989 pHello Ive read some threads in here about using ajax to confirm a password in jsf. However while trying Im getting a NPE when trying to get the string from the confirmed password. I dont know why, but it worked before I tried to render an icon saying the test failed. So Im assuming that when I try to render the icons using ajax, since the confirm password field is null there goes the exception. However even with a test before assigning the value to the string confirmPassword the error still comes.p  pmy form                                   p  precode            lt password gt                         lttrgtlttdgt             lthoutputLabel forpasswordgtregistering.PasswordlthoutputLabelgtlttdgtlttdgt             ltppassword idpassword valuesubscribeUser.user.password feedbacktrue                 inlinetrue                 promptLabelregistering.PleaseEnterPass weakLabelregistering.Weak                 goodLabelregistering.Good strongLabelregistering.Strong                 requiredMessageregistering.reqPassword                 validatorpasswordValidator.validategt                 ltfattribute nameconfirm valueconfirmPassword gt  lt This event leads to NPE gt                 ltfajax eventblur renderpasswordCheckgtltfajaxgt                                ltppasswordgtlttdgtlttdgt  lt Here are the icons which create the NPE gt             lthpanelGroup idpasswordCheck  gt                 lthgraphicImage libraryimagesicons namefailedindicator.png renderedpasswordValidator.isIndicatorVisible.usernameFailedgtlthgraphicImagegt                 lthgraphicImage libraryimagesicons namesuccessindicator.png renderedpasswordValidator.isIndicatorVisible.usernameSuccessgtlthgraphicImagegt             lthpanelGroupgtlttdgtlttdgt             ltspan classerrorgtlthmessage idpasswordMessage forpasswordgtltspangtlttdgt             lttrgt                         lt Confirm password gt              lttrgtlttdgt             lthoutputLabel forconfirmPassword valueConfirm password   gtlttdgtlttdgt             ltppassword idconfirmPassword requiredtrue                 requiredMessageregistering.PleaseConfirmPassword                  validatorpasswordValidator.validate                 bindingconfirmPasswordgt                 ltfajax eventblur executepassword confirmPassword renderpasswordMessage passwordConfMessagegt                                       ltppasswordgt lttdgtlttdgtlttdgtlttdgt             ltspan classerrorgtlthmessage idpasswordConfMessage forconfirmPasswordgtltspangtlttdgt             lttrgt          lttablegt         lthcommandButton valueSubmit actionsubscribeUser.inscrireUsergtlthcommandButtongt      lthformgt codepre  pmy validator beanp  precode  ManagedBean public class PasswordValidator implements Validator       private MapltString, Booleangt isIndicatorVisible      public PasswordValidator          this.isIndicatorVisible  new HashMapltgt         this.isIndicatorVisible.putpasswordSuccess, false         this.isIndicatorVisible.putpasswordFailed, false           Override     public void validateFacesContext context, UIComponent component,             Object value throws ValidatorException           String password  value.toString         UIInput uiInputConfirmPassword  UIInput component.getAttributes                 .getconfirm         String confirmPassword  uiInputConfirmPassword.getSubmittedValue                 .toString this line error codepre  hr  pTHE ERROR IS ABOVE THIS LINEp  hr  precode        if password  null  password.isEmpty  confirmPassword  null                  confirmPassword.isEmpty              this.isIndicatorVisible.replacepasswordFailed, false             this.isIndicatorVisible.replacepasswordSuccess, true             return                  if password.length lt 6              uiInputConfirmPassword.setValidfalse             this.isIndicatorVisible.replacepasswordSuccess, false             this.isIndicatorVisible.replacepasswordFailed, true             throw new ValidatorExceptionnew FacesMessage                     Your password must be at least 6 characters long.                  if password.equalsconfirmPassword              uiInputConfirmPassword.setValidfalse             this.isIndicatorVisible.replacepasswordSuccess, false             this.isIndicatorVisible.replacepasswordFailed, true             throw new ValidatorExceptionnew FacesMessage                     Passwords dont match.                    public MapltString, Booleangt getIsIndicatorVisible          return isIndicatorVisible       codepre  pThose test give me the values 2a and 2b.p  precode    if component.getAttributes.getconfirm  null          System.out.println1a      else          System.out.println2a           if UIInput component.getAttributes.getconfirm             .getSubmittedValue.toString  null          System.out.println1b      else          System.out.println2b      codepre  pHowever the second test b gives me an NPE.p

Negative 7989 pIve inherited a swath of code that talks to a device developed inhouse. Said device has a network interface that is, generously, rather adhocp  ul liit always sets its IP address to be 172.16.0.50, and assumes its connected directly to 172.16.0.250 via a physical cableli liit sends a UDP heartbeat to .2502000, regardless of whether .250 has bound to that portli liit can send UDP traffic to .2509001 through .2509016li liit exposes a textbased admin interface over TCP at .507734li liit binds as UDP to .507734 and accepts any incoming traffic on that port as a timestamp to synchronize itself againstli ul  pModifying the devices code is absolutely out of the question, sadly. Source is available, unboxed hardware is available to test against, but deployed boxes are aggressively sealed against the environment, and gaining access to the flash chip it boots from is a daylong process.p  pIm interested in attaching several of these devices to the same host computer, but my background is in applications, web, and some embedded  not networking. Each device has a dedicated network interface eg p1p1, p1p2, etc, which I think should save me, but Im not sure how to set Fedora up to do the necessary impersonation, and Im not sure how to set up my application code to distinguish between UDP traffic on interface p1p1  IP 172.16.0.50  port 9000, from UDP traffic from interface p1p2  IP 172.16.0.50  port 9000, or to specify that I want to broadcast a given datagram via UDP at 172.16.0.509000 on interface p1p1 vs 172.16.0.509000 on interface p1p2.p  pI believe I can pull this off with a sufficiently clever combination of static routing entries and iptables rules for bidirectional port forwarding, but Id like to ask before spending days on a fundamentally flawed approach. Whats the sanest way to make this palatablep

Negative 7989 pI want to check with jQuery which li element from a list of li elements is the active one they represent a menu, and I want to check which menu item is currently active.p  pSo, I store all the li items in a variable, myElements. Then I ask the length of myElements, and apply some style changes to them, up to here everything works. Apparently this way my variable myElements is a Nodelist, not an array, so I declare another variable myElementsarray, which contains the same elements as myElements and is an array also tested and it works.p  pThen I try to check which of the elements from myElementsarray has the currentmenuitem class, but it doesnt work and the google chrome console says theres an error Uncaught TypeError myElementsarray[j].hasClass is not a function. Does anyone have an idea what the reason might bep  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt var myElements  jQuerynavbar gt ul gt li var count  myElements.length  for var i  0 i lt myElements.length i  myElements[i].style.width  100count   var myElementsarray  [] forvar i  myElements.length i myElementsarray.unshiftmyElements[i]  var j  0 while  myElementsarray[j].hasClasscurrentmenuparent   j  document.writej ltscriptgt codepre
Negative 7989 pI currently try to prototype a product recommendation system using the Elasticsearch Significant Terms aggregation. So far, I didnt find a good example yet which deals with flat JSON structures of codesalescode here The codeitemIdcode coming from a relational database, such as minep  pDocument 1p  precode     lineItemId 1,     lineNo 1,     itemId 1,     productId 1234,     userId 4711,     salesQuantity 2,     productPrice 0.99,     salesGross 1.98,     salesTimestamp 1234567890  codepre  pDocument 2p  precode     lineItemId 1,     lineNo 2,     itemId 1,     productId 1235,     userId 4711,     salesQuantity 1,     productPrice 5.99,     salesGross 5.99,     salesTimestamp 1234567890  codepre  pI have around 1.5 million of these documents in my Elasticsearch index. A codelineItemcode is a part of a codesalecode identified by codeitemIdcode, which can consist of 1 or more codelineItemscode What I would like to receive is the, say, 5 most uncommonly common products which were bought in conjunction with the sale of one specific codeproductIdcode.p  pThe MovieLens example a hrefhttpswww.elastic.coguideenelasticsearchguidecurrentsignificanttermsdemo.html relnofollowhttpswww.elastic.coguideenelasticsearchguidecurrentsignificanttermsdemo.htmla deals with data in the structure of p  precode     movie [122,185,231,292,               316,329,355,356,362,364,370,377,420,               466,480,520,539,586,588,589,594,616     ],     user 1  codepre  pso its unfortunately not really useful to me. Id be very glad for an example or a suggestion using my flat structures. Thanks a lot in advance.p
Negative 7989 pOccasionally maybe one in ten times, and these times are pretty clustered together Mongooses Modelcreate passes a Connection into my callback rather than a document instance. There are no errors passed, it does this with promises too, and Ive only been able to reliably get the error when running mocha tests.p  pFor example, the following codep  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecodeUser.createdata, function err, user      if err return callbackerr     console.loguser     console.logdata  codepre  pwill only occasionally log an object of class Connection, like,p  pre classlangjs prettyprintoverridecoderesult  ok 1, n 0 ,   connection     domain null,      events ... codepre  prather than a created model instance. codeerrcode is null and a codedatacode is exactly as expected and identical to codedatacode when codeusercode emisem a model instance as expected.p  pWith codenodeinspectorcode Ive managed to trace it down to mongooses code.savecode returning the codeConnectioncode object, but now Im at a loss. Specifying a journaled write concern has absolutely no effect. Anyone seen anything like this beforep

Negative 7989 pstrongThe context isstrong MVC5JavascriptSPA application.p  pstrongThe case isstrong  The user clicks here and there and generates requests.

For simplicity, I also use signal.p  pFor solving my doubt, I test my code in a mount of ways, by modifying the detail in the code.I  observe the appearance of them and  make a conclusion, which seems acceptable and reasonable.I try to find some useful information about the timer detail to support my opinion, but I fail.p  pBelow is my procedure.p  pIf I setitimer and signalSIGALRM,SIGIGN at begin of my code, call getitimer in the while loop, the itinterval isnt 0 but the itvalue is 0 always,in other words,  the itinterval not reset the itvalue.p  pIn move function in my code, I firstly signalSIGALRM, SIGIGN and signalSIGALRM, move before returning, the signal will arise as usual.But when I remove the signalSIGALRM, move, after the last itvalue decrementing to 0, itinterval will not reset the itvalue. On the other hand, if I dont remove the signalSIGALRM, move, at that time itvalue decrementing to 0, the status of alarm  signal is being caught, so the itinterval will reset the itvalue and the program work well. Using the getitimer can find this phenomenon.p  pBelow is my conclusion.p  pI call setitimer, the timer begin.When the itvalue decrementing to 0 at every time, the timer will check whether there is a catch for the signal.If not, the timer disable itinterval dont reset the itvalue forever. If I wanna catch the signal again after the timer disable , I need call setitimer again.At this time, the timer still exist but the status is disable.This kind of  disable isnt equal to the kind of disable , which itvalue is 0 and itinterval is 0p  pBut at the window of itvalue isnt 0 , I change the catching the signal, I dont need call setitimer again.p  pConsidering the reliability, I had better call setitimer before reset the signal.p  pThe conclusion seems to strange, if you have interesting about it, testing it by yourself.p

Negative 7989 pIf I create a Formula Field A containing only 11000 and then drag it out into the report it will show 0,00 due to default number of decimals is set to 1.00 and default rounding is set to 0.01 for a field of with the type Number.  No problems.  When decimals and rounding are adjusted it will show 0,001.p  pWhen I create Formula Field B that only contains A and increase decimals and rounding it will show as 0,001000000000.p  pBut if I use A to create a text, totextA   test, the result will be 0,00 test and I can not figure out a way to show the correct 0,001 test without adding totextA,3.

I put the code into a plnkr to show a coworker, and you can see all my code to see if theres something stand out wrong, and while Ill try to put together a working case, it involves an API, a bunch of code around it, and I suspect my simplifying it to make a working plnkr will solve the problem and not help figure out the issue Im having.

Negative 7989 pI am trying to connect to an SFTP server with my AIR application. It doesnt matter that its an AIR application except that I havent found any libraries or AIR API methods for it. p  pMy first thought is to find a library in another language and rewrite it in ActionScript. Id rather not do that and my lack of experience may introduce security issues. p  pMy second thought is to call a native process or command such as codesftpcode or codesshpasscode or codecurlcode from my main application and pass the local and remote upload locations to it and let it do the work. The downside to this is if they dont have the command installed they have to install a separate program.p  pMy questions are p  ol liAre these SFTP commands available by default on both Mac and Windows li liShould I store the users login I do not want to or prompt them to enter it each time Does SFTP  public key remove the need for that li ol  pIve found two related questions a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions24457328sftpscpfileswithbashrq1herea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5386482howtorunthesftpcommandwithapasswordfrombashscriptherea but some of it is over my head. They also seem to be specific to nux which may work for Mac as well but not Windows. p  pI do not have the experience in this area so I would welcome those with experience to give guidance if this is a good idea or not. Overview type answers are welcome for me as I can attempt to work out the details. If no answer is given, once Ive figured it out Ill post an answer.

I understand there may be other factors that influence the results I am getting. I am looking for someone with more insight into the inner workings of Entity Framework to suggest how they would approach this.p  hr  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIve now been told by more than one person that my emMethod 1em does not load all related employees. But I have run multiple tests on this that show that it does. Ive even created a simple test application. Here is my code.p  precodevar website  context.Websites.FirstOrDefault var ranking  website.Rankings.FirstOrDefault codepre  pSeems that some people assume the second line will only load one row from the codeRankingscode table. However, here are the queries generatedp  precodeSELECT TOP 1  [c].[ID] AS [ID],  [c].[Title] AS [Title],  [c].[URL] AS [URL],  [c].[AliasForID] AS [AliasForID],  [c].[ActiveState] AS [ActiveState],  [c].[Alert] AS [Alert] FROM [dbo].[Website] AS [c] codepre  pAndp  precodeexec spexecutesql NSELECT  [Extent1].[ID] AS [ID],  [Extent1].[WebsiteID] AS [WebsiteID],  [Extent1].[PageRank] AS [PageRank],  [Extent1].[AlexaRank] AS [AlexaRank],  [Extent1].[AlexaReach] AS [AlexaReach],  [Extent1].[DateAdded] AS [DateAdded] FROM [dbo].[Ranking] AS [Extent1] WHERE [Extent1].[WebsiteID]  EntityKeyValue1,NEntityKeyValue1 int,EntityKeyValue11 codepre  pNote the second query. It returns all rows from the codeRankingcode table that are linked to the codeWebsitecode entity. It does not filter to return only the first row. In the same way, accessing codecompany1.Employeescode to call the codeAddcode method will load all employees related to codecompany1code because codeWebsite.Rankingscode is of type codeICollectionltgtcode and not codeIQueryableltgtcode.p  pLazy loading is completely unrelated. Lazy loading simply means that the collection is not loaded until the code references this collection or any other property that refers to data from a related table. But once the code references this collection, all related entities are loaded.p  pI would love someone to show me how this is untrue or how to prevent this. So far, the only people who are saying it is untrue are not willing to back it up andor just insult me when I asked them to back up their claims. Not understanding how this works can lead to major performance problems.p
