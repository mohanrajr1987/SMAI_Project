Positive 355 pIm creating a django application which uses both the Django Rest Framework and the plain djangoviews as entrypoint for users.p  pI want to do validation both independant fields of my models, and on objects on a whole.

Relates to zipcode and country in the model.pli ul  pFor the DRFAPI i use ModelSerializers which automatically call all the validators i have placed in my Model, for examplep  precodeclass MyModelmodels.Model     licenceplate  CharFieldmaxlength20, validators[LicencePlateValidator] codepre  pSince the validator is given in the model, the API POSTS because i use a ModelSerializer, as well as the objects created in the django admin backend are validated. p  pBut when i want to introduce object level validation i need to do that in the serializers strongvalidatestrongmethod, which means objects are only validated in the API.p  pIll have to override the models save method too, to validate the objects created in the Django admin page. p  pstrongQuestionstrong This seems a bit messy to me, is there a single point where i can put the objectlevel validators so that they are run at the API and in the adminpage, like i did with the fieldlevel validation I only have to put emthemem in my modeldeclaration and everything is handledp
Positive 355 pIm familiar with the concepts of MVVM and have used MvvmCross, but am trying out ReactiveUI and trying to wrap my head around some concepts.p  pIm writing a tool in WPF maybe branching to other frameworks for designers to create and edit data files that are then used by another enduser program.

Is there a direct way to pass codeValidator.Errorscode back to the codeViewcode, or would I have to create an codeIObservablecode or codeReactiveListcode property for the codeViewcode to subscribep  pSimilarly, I would like to have a save function that first performs validation. If no validation errors are found, it saves the codeDataModelcode to file. If errors are found, the codeViewcode should inform the user and get confirmation before saving.

Positive 355 pI define a one to many relationship. A customer can have many orders but an order can belong to only one customer. An order can have many itemcodes but an item code can only belong to one order. An order has a required field codeDateCreatedcode. And an Item with itemcode has a required field, codeItemNamecode. From a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq25576459807223HEREa I understand the use of custom validators in breeze.p  pBut say I create a customer entity with multiple orders. I then add another order with a null codeDateCreatedcode field, thus making this entity invalid. If i try to validate the customer entity using codecustomer.entityAspect.validateEntitycode, should breeze be able to validate each item in the orders and result that the customer entity is invalid because it has an order with no codeDateCreatedcodep  pSimilarly if I add an item to an order with no codeItemNamecode, will breeze still determine that the customer is invalid because it contains an order with one item lacking an item name That is, will breeze validate any depth of nested relationshipsp  pI have been trying this for a while but to no avail. Collections defined in EF are not just validated when I use codeentity.entityAspect.validateEntitycode, but the validation fails when I try saving. If I try validating the order entity itself order.entityAspect.validateEntity or the Item Entity itself codeitem.entityAspect.validateEntitycode, the validation works fine. I just does not when I try validating the parent entity customercodecustomer.entityAspect.validateEntitycode. I am wondering if this is normal or I am doing something wrong. Should this validation be handled using custom validatorsp

Positive 355 pI am working on a file parervalidator application that needs to pull in records from various flat filesCSV, Fixed Width, etc, validate the data in the columns and eventually present the data to the calling application in a DataTable for processing. In this I need to make a decision on a tradeoff between memory usage and speed. Heres the dilemma. I cant build the DataTable with the appropriate column types until I know that all of the data is correct. I cant very well stick the value one into a column of type Int or Decimal. So I need to loop through the file processing each field on each record determining if it of the correct type and within the appropriate range. If there is a error I need to write that to an errors column in the Table and then it will eventually be presented to the user for correction. If the error is one that precludes me from putting the data value into its column e.g. text into a numeric column then I have an issue. What Ive determined is that I need a DataTable that has all stringtext columns plus one extra to report the errors for the record. If there are no errors then I need to go back through the data putting it into a DataTable where the columns are the appropriate type and returning it back to the calling application indicating that it passed the validation. If not then I return the DataTable where all of the columns are text with the additional error column so it can present the data to the user to be corrected.p  pSo heres the question. p  ul liWould it be better to loop through the file twice Validating the data on the first pass and then building up the valid DataTable on the secondli liWould it be better to better to loop through the file once building up the all text display DataTable and then loop through that first DataTable on the second pass building up the valid DataTableli liWould it be better to build up both DataTables simultaneously as I make one pass through the file and then toss out the valid DataTable if I encounter an errorli ul  pThe first two approaches would use less memory but would take longer. And which of these two would take longer Looping through the file twice or looping through the file once and the resulting DataTable once The third option would be faster, because I am only looping through the data one time. Given that there could easily be several hundred thousand records in any given file, this could be significant. On the other hand, given that number of records, having two DataTables in memory would chew up a lot of additional memory. This being initially targeted to a web application that is not a desirable either.p  pAny thoughts andor suggestions on this would be truly appreciated.p  pThanks, Dougp  pIf you are going to down vote this as I see two people already have, please be respectful enough to add a comment as to why.p

Positive 355 pi have a main window that contains multiple UserControls, arranged as tab pages and tab groups much like Visual Studio allows to have two or more editors visible at the same time. p  pI also have the possibility to open such an UserControl into a seperate floating window.p  pOne of these UserControls contains simple form fields e.g. text boxes. These text boxes are bounded with common databinding to an object  property. The binding mode is OnValidation not on OnPropertyChanged. p  pWhen I switch the focus from this User Control inside the main window into another UserControl in the Main windows, the validation is automatically performed and the databinding is finised  the changed text will be set on the model object  property that is bounded to that text field.p  pBut if I switch the focus to an UserControl which resides in another floating window, the databinding is not finished since no validation is performed.p  pI know that I can handle this manually by triggering ValidateChildren etc, but this seems to my the wrong way  is ugly. p  pIs there a correct  clean way to solve this issue I want that the validation is performed as soon as the UserControl loses its focus or the window gets deactivated. p  pOne information On of my UserControls contains a TreeControl. If I edit a tree node label, and when I switch the focus to another foating window, the label edit is finished automatically.

For examplep  precodepublic class Customer      public string Name getset     public string Address getset   public class Product      public string Name getset     public decimal Price getset   public class StoreHelper      public void PurchaseProductCustomer c, Product p                Lookup Customer and Product in db           Create records for purchase           etc.       codepre  pWhen the app needs to do a purchase, it would create the StoreHelper, and call the method on the domain objects.  To me, it would make sense for the CustomerProduct to know how to save itself to a repository, but you probably wouldnt want Save methods on the domain objects.  It would also make sense for a method like Customer.PurchaseProduct, but that is putting domain logic on the entity.p  pHere are some techniques Ive come across, not sure which are goodbadp  ol liCustomer and Product inherit from an Entity class, which provides the basic CRUD operations in a generic fashion using an ORM maybe. ul liPros Each data object would automatically get the CRUD operations, but are then tied to the databaseORMli liCons This does not solve the problem of business operations on the objects, and also ties all domain objects to a base Entity that might not be appropriateli ulli liUse helper classes to handle the CRUD operations and business logic ul liDoes it make sense to have DAOs for the pure database operations, and separate business helpers for the more businessspecific operationsli liIs it better to use nonstatic or static helper classes for thisli liPros domain objects are not tied to any databasebusiness logic completely anemicli liCons not very OO, not very natural to use helpers in application code looks like C codeli ulli liUse the Double Dispatch technique where the entity has methods to save to an arbitrary repository ul liPros better separation of concernsli liCons entities have some extra logic attached although its decoupledli ulli liIn C 3.0, you could use extension methods to attach the CRUDbusiness methods to a domain object without touching it ul liIs this a valid approach  What are prosconsli ulli liOther techniquesli ol  pWhat are the best techniques for handling this  Im pretty new to DDD Im reading the Evans book  so maybe that will open my eyesp

Negative 355 pA project I was working on has finished, so Ive been moved on to some new tasking at my employer.  The previous work was very agile, small team, progress over procedure, etc etc.p  pSo anyway, the new project Im on  I find myself confused on how to deal with management.  They have no real understanding of object oriented programing , current technologies or methodologies.  They seem to fear change and just recently we moved to the latest JREp  pWe do these code reviews and I have to listen to gray beards saying how much better it is in ADA or how they used to do things in C.  But then when they try to code review  they lack even the most basic understanding of OOP design and dev.  They focus more on the style of the code spacing method names etc.  p  pOne of the senior level people say we should be writing our own logger instead of using log4j because of one negative review of log4j in an academic PDF written ages ago. p  pHow do I deal with this  How can I explain to them that their design is faulty or that they are really behind the times, without coming across as a jerk.  Ive only been with this organization for about a year  so I dont know how much credibility I will have.p
Negative 355 pIve been designing web services for quite a while now but never had to expose a complicated WCF service until recently.  I was baffled at the apparent lack of proper support in WCF for abstract types. Sure  you can USE them  sure you can get them to work... you just dont end up with what you WANT...  p  pThe first problem is that if you generate code from a wsdl with an abstract type you get vastly different code because it falls back to the xmlserializer and not the DataContractSerializer.  This is obviously a bit less than desirable... Id like to use the fancy new faster serializer please thank you... and all that comes along with ServiceDataContractp  pon the flip side  if you start with code first and expose a properly attributed abstract wcf class as a web service the exposed wsdl does NOT contain the abstracttrue attribute making the abstract class technically concrete...  This is not what I want of course...p  pIve got a workaround but it involves a crazy amount of hackery where I create the wsdlxsd contract first, remove any abstracttrue oh  lets not mention that I cant use attributes in the xsd shall we and then svcuitl the result... But now Im left with a c api that has a CONCRETE abstract class and I then need to go modify that to ADD the abstract keyword...  This works but its a huge pita  and not easily scriptable...p  pThis is all just whacked  Im hoping someone can explain to me precisely why this is...   I welcome answers that dont cite solid resources but Im really waiting for the person to tell me  with proper documentation like preferably from good ol Don Box himself why exactly this is...

Negative 355 pWe are in the process of updating the construction of our products .msi package for Windows Server 2008.  The main component of our install is an application that is run as a Windows service.  There is also a configuration application that gets run during install to set up registry entries for use by the service.p  pThe service and the configuration application rely on the Microsoft CC runtime and MFC, which are included in the .msi as merge modules.  The assemblies for the CC runtime and MFC are committed during the InstallFinalize, which seems to preclude the starting of the service using the mechanisms provided by Windows Installer is this correct  Certainly, we see sidebyside errors with at least the configuration application if it is run before InstallFinalize.p  pThe approach we have taken is to run the configuration application as a commit custom action after InstallFinalize, and have this application start the service.  This requires that the application is executed with elevated privileges for which we use a manifest containing a trustInfo section.  This further requires that the .msi is configured to run this application without Impersonation which otherwise confounds the privilege elevation.p  pIs this an acceptable approach  How futureproof is this likely to be  Are there any gotchas to be aware ofp  pIt seems that this is a problem that has been encountered by othersp  pa hrefhttpwww.mailarchive.comwixuserslists.sourceforge.netmsg12666.html relnofollowhttpwww.mailarchive.comwixuserslists.sourceforge.netmsg12666.htmlap  pIs there an officially or unofficially accepted way to deal with such problemsp  pAs an addendum to this, is there any way of ensuring that an application run as a custom action during the install process gets focus when it starts up  Applications started in this manner always seem to pop up behind the installer and the installer keeps focus, which is not a particularly userfriendly effect.p  pMany Thanks,p  pBruce.p

Negative 355 pgot a weird question for you based on some weird happenings on our site. We have strongfour .DLLsstrong in our ASP.Net solution ie. managed code in the bin folder. This strongmorningstrong we updated all four of them, the site was tested and worked fine.p  pThis strongafternoonstrong I uploaded a new version of strongonestrong of the DLLs, and it took the whole site down, much to our dismay. I quickly swapped out the new one for the old one, taking the site back into the state before Id uploaded the DLL, but the site was still down. We were forced to restart the entire server, but still no joy As far as we were concerned, the site had been returned to exactly the same state it had been in before Id uploaded anything, and it still wasnt working.p  pSo, after a bit of investigating we discovered that it was a bug in one of the DLLs that had been uploaded that strongmorningstrong i.e not related to the DLL Id uploaded in the afternoon. p  pWhat we seem to have discovered is that, for some odd reason, the AppDomain didnt recycle properly when we uploaded our DLLs in the morning. Some of the changes made to the site went live, but at least one of the DLLs remained cached, instead of being updated.p  pWhen I uploaded a DLL later that afternoon, it caused an AppDomain recycle which then included the bugged DLL that was uploaded this morning.p  pHas anyone else had problem with the AppDomain not recycling when it should Or possibly have another explanation for what it could be AFAIK the AppDomain should be recycled every time theres a change made to any file in the bin folder...

Negative 355 pIs there any book or tutorial for connecting to a database running on a remote server I have experience only with local databases in C .NET 2.0 SQLite, Firebird, but now I need to place the database on a remote server.

Just some best practices or so.p  pThanks, Petrp
Negative 355 pI have Googled and read, but didnt find answers for these three simple questions...p  ol lipShould header file name be equal to code file name  For example, I have function void foo declared in foo.h. It is used in main.c which includes foo.h Must foo be implemented in foo.c What if it would be implemented in foox.c Because I have a source code that has decoder.h header but decode.c code file and everything seems to work. There is no decoder.c nor decode.h files in the project. pli lipWhat is extern used for when functions are declared with extern.  In the said project, decoder.h declares extern functions while decode.c implements them. How does extern works here and how is it actually supposed to work I always thought extern is used to let the compiler know it will find this somewhere else like I declare a variable in main.c, which includes foo.h, in foo.c which implements functions from foo.h I want to change that variables value, so I declare it as extern. pli lipAlso, minor question on C syntax, I have a code that has function implementations that look like thisp  precodeint functionparam1,param2,param3 int param1,param2 char param3      function body  codepre  pMy Qt Creator complains about this code and code navigation does not work, but the code compiles and executes well.

Negative 355 pI have this program that forks and creates three POSIX pipes for the childs stdin, stdout, amp stderr.  After forking, the child and parent closes the appropriate ends of their respective pipes such that the child can only read from the stdin pipe and only write to the stdout and stderr pipes and the opposite is true of the parent. Next, the child process closes and dups the childs stdin, stdout, and stderr to its open pipe ends and then uses execvp to execute the program whose name was passed in as the parents program arguments. The program when behaves as it should for commands such as cat,ls,rm,banner,amp ps without any noticeable issue. p  pHowever, when I run the program in the terminal like this p  blockquote   pprogram grep blahp blockquote  pit takes input but doesnt output anything to the terminal but when I tryp  blockquote   pgrep blahp blockquote  pin the terminal grep waits for input and prints it back out if the input contained the word blah.

Negative 355 pthis is actually a follow up to a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4311274visualstudioaddingdllasreferenceerror titlequestionquestiona I asked yesterday about problems with using older DLLs in Visual C 2010. I have added the configuration file and the DLL runs well. The issue Im having is that I would like to avoid having my entire project run in legacy mode. p  pI have gone around this by creating a new console project with command line access to all the functions I need from the DLL and read the output in my main project. This way it acts as a separate component, and I dont have to worry about legacy mode affecting anything in my main project.p  pThe problem is that I feel as though this will really slow down my application in the long run, and since what I am developing needs to be fast, I was wondering if there is another approach to doing this. As I mentioned in the previous question, I cannot rebuild the DLL in 4.0.p  pThanks,p  pPMp

Negative 355 pI am currently working on an application with an interface that consists of a number of buttons that represent an action, only one action can be assigned to each record in the database.  When the user selects an action they get an optional entry which consists of a choice from 3 more buttons.p  pOne way to do this is to define 3 extra buttons in the correct position for every action button 7x3 and only show the set based on the action button clicked.  However the button values of these are the same for each action so it would make sense if these could be defined once then shown in the appropriate position relative to the action button once clicked.p  pIs there a way to do this in WPFp

Negative 355 pOk, so I am using MVC 3 and it is great at deserializing a JSON data set into a strongly typed object that is passed to my controller action. Unfortunately I have not found a solution to a more dynamic case.p  pDoes the built in Json deserialisation and classes have support for an undefined property set For example lets say I have some fixed data like name and age, but I also want to pass down a dynamically created rating list where the user could enter or select a movie and set a rating value in a table.p  pThe model data structure could be something like thisp  precodepublic class UserRatings    public string Name  get set    public int Age  get set    public Dictionaryltstring,intgt Ratings  get set   codepre  pBut assuming that my Json dataset looks like this from javascriptp  precodevar data   Name name, Age age, Ratings rating  codepre  pWhere the rating variable is a dynamically constructed object that consist of the name or id of of the movie as key and rating as number. Naturally deserialization of this in the controller action will not be successful as it does not understand the mapping of Ratings to the rather complex dictionary object. But is there a generic Json collection that I could use instead for Ratings as an intermediate formatp  pI have tried making the Ratings object a Json string in javascript and just sending a string down, but I am unable to find a factory or something that can make a Json structure in C that I can iterate over to get the data out. The classes codeJsoncode and codeJsonResultcode does not help me in this regard it seems. Basically how can I use the built in Json support in MVC to do my own deserialisation into some generic Json collection objectp

Negative 355 pThis question is based onp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions874432whenisitsafetodestroyapthreadbarrierWhen is it safe to destroy a pthread barrierap  pand the recent glibc bug reportp  pa hrefhttpsourceware.orgbugzillashowbug.cgiid12674httpsourceware.orgbugzillashowbug.cgiid12674ap  pIm not sure about the semaphores issue reported in glibc, but presumably its supposed to be valid to destroy a barrier as soon as codepthreadbarrierwaitcode returns, as per the above linked question. Normally, the thread that got codePTHREADBARRIERSERIALTHREADcode, or a special thread that already considered itself responsible for the barrier object, would be the one to destroy it. The main use case I can think of is when a barrier is used to synchronize a new threads use of data on the creating threads stack, preventing the creating thread from returning until the new thread gets to use the data other barriers probably have a lifetime equal to that of the whole program, or controlled by some other synchronization object.p  pIn any case, stronghowstrong can an implementation ensure that destruction of the barrier and possibly even unmapping of the memory it resides in is safe as soon as codepthreadbarrierwaitcode returns in any thread It seems the other threads that have not yet returned would need to examine at least some part of the barrier object to finish their work and return, much like how, in the glibc bug report cited above, codesempostcode has to examine the waiters count after having adjusted the semaphore value.p

But my question is that Is there any parser or software to extract the methods invocation. p

Negative 355 pTheres an existing website written in PHP. Originally only the website existed, but now an Android application is being built that would benefit from reusing some of the PHP logic.p  pThe PHP site was structured such that there are many pages that perform an action, set successerror information in codeSESSIONcode, and then redirect to a visual page without outputting any content themselves. For example, theres codeactionlogin.phpcodep  pThe page accepts a username and password from GET or POST variables, validates the credentials, sets successfailure messages in SESSION, and then redirects to the loggedin homepage on success or back to the login screen on failure.  Lets call this behavior the HTML response.p  pThe Android application will need to call the same page but somehow tell it that it wants an XML response instead.  When the page detects this, it will output successerror message in an XML format instead of putting them in codeSESSIONcode and strongwontstrong redirect. Thats the idea anyway. This helps prevent duplicate code.

Negative 355 pI am working on a Wicketbased web app on Java EE.p  pI am trying to find a way to ensure that any entities used as model objects are always attached to the current EntityManager before Wicket tries to render any components. This way, when the components grab data from their model, the data can be lazilyloaded by the entity as needed.p  pThere are lots of tutorials out there, and some posts on here, referring to LoadableDetachableModels LDM as the solution.  This has worked for us when we dont need to keep any state inbetween requests.  In these cases, whenever the page is rendered, the LDM will load the most recent version of the required entity from the database.p  pHowever, there are times when a user needs to edit data in a stateful form via multiple steps before she saves the data, so the model needs to retain the entity in its unsaved state.  An LDM would effectively wipe out the users changes on every step.p  pSo far, we have been using a model that merges the entity with the persistence context when needed.  Here is a simplified versionp  precodepublic final class DetachableMergingModelltE extends Identifiablegt implements IModelltEgt       private E entity     private boolean attached  false      public DetachableMergingModelE entity          this.entity  entity           Override     public E getObject          if attached              attached  true              Nontransactional method merges entity with persistence context               but does not flush any data to database             entity  getRepository.mergeentity                               return entity           Override     public void setObjectE entity          this.entity  entity           Override     public void detach           This ensures that the next call to getObject will merge the entity with           the persistence context         attached  false           ...   codepre  pOur EntityManager is injected by GlassFish and it spans a whole servlet request, so when an entity is attached to the persistence context, it will stay attached until after the page has been rendered.p  pThis Model above takes care of situations where the entity is already persisted and is just being edited.  Whenever a component on the page calls getObject on this model, the Model will merge the entity with the persistence context, and we are free to navigate the whole object graph of the entity without throwing any LazyInitializationExceptions.p  pHowever, in a situation where the entity is new and has not been persisted, we cannot use this Model because the entity is not ready to be merged yet.  This is often the case when the user is creating a new entity, and still needs to populate it with values via the form.  In this case, we want to have the same freedom navigating the object graph of the entity as some associations have already been set, such as the entitys parent, without fear of a LazyInitializationException.p  pA similar solution is described a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2919984passinginformationsafelybetweenwicketandhibernateinlongrunningconversat29379992937999herea option 3, but it does not cover the new entity usecase described above.p  pHas anyone come across this usecase  How did you solve it  Is there a better way to integrate Wicket with JPA than through custom IModel implementationsp

Negative 355 pIn one of the screens of my application, Ive implemented a horizontal scrolling tableview.

Ive spent the better half of this day on this but with no luck so far.p  pThe tableview frame changes according to the tables autoresizingMasks and is OK. The problem is with the tableview cells which do not autoresize well.p  pIve managed to nicely resize the height of the cells with a smooth animation using this small piece of code the view controller.p  precode   voidwillRotateToInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationtoInterfaceOrientation durationNSTimeIntervalduration      [volumesPicker beginUpdates]       [volumesPicker endUpdates]       NSIndexPath    indexPath      [NSIndexPath indexPathForRowcurrentFocusedIndex inSection0]     [volumesPicker scrollToRowAtIndexPathindexPath atScrollPositionUITableViewScrollPositionTop animatedYES]      [super willRotateToInterfaceOrientationtoInterfaceOrientation durationduration]     codepre  pThe problem is with the tableview cell width.  For examplep  ol lipI start the application with the device in landscape mode. The tableview is rendered nicely. pli lipI rotate the device in portrait mode, and my cells suddenly have smaller widths than the table remember, that the tableview is rotated so the width of the cell is actually measured vertically. pli lipThen I rotate the device back in landscape mode, and my cells spill out from the table frame.pli ol  pThis problem happens only when the tableview has the rotation transform applied. If I remove it, the cells update perfectly. Also, Ive tested and the individual cells rotation do not affect this problem  only the entire tableview transform is a problem.p  pSo, has anybody encountered this problem before... or have any knowledge how I might control the width of a cell. At this point Im not even interested in a smooth animation. I just need something that works.p  pThank you,p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pUpon further investigation today, I have discovered that after the rotation, the cells will resize so that they use the height of the table as both width and height of the cell. p  pThis means that after the rotation, I will always have square cells equal to the height of the table Ive tested this by manually setting the height of the table, and it checks out.p  pThe bigger problem is that even if I manually resize my cells after the rotation, the newly created cells will still have the problem. Somehow the table fucks up the value he uses for the cell width. p

So we tried using a user agent string for Palm Pre phone on our desktop computer and it displays a pop up message when we try navigating to that page.

Negative 355 pI need to connect one of the thermal network receipts to iPhoneiPad.  The printer doesnt support AirPrint feature.  Now it is currently connected to the router and has an IP address.  It looks like when I am trying to find it in the current domain using Bonjour listen to service types printer.tcp, printer.udp, ldp.tcpudp, ndd.tcpudp it is not showing up. p  pIf I go to Printer Settings on my Mac and trying to find that printer from Defaults which I assume uses Bonjour too, it is not there too. The only way for me to add the printer to the Mac computer is by entering the IP manually which is not what I want. Plus, if I reshare the printer added manually from Mac, then I can search it on iPhoneiPad using Bonjour and listening for the service ipp. tcp. p  pAnother thing I tried is to use something like dnssd P Thermal Printer printer.tcp. local 515 thermal.local 196.168.0.3  using the IP I already know. It looks like it is working too. p  pBut, what I need is to be able to find the printer from iPhoneiPad automatically, like the Square app does. I am not sure if it is possible using Bonjour what service I need to search for, or I need to use sockets and listen to a particular port. p  pAny advice would be appreciated. p

The parent View binds a codeContentControlcode to this codeOverlaycode property and data templating takes care of the rest.p  pstrongCstrong p  pThe first seems to encapsulate the functionality more, with the app not having to care about showing and hiding the overlay, but exposing a constant codeConnectProgressViewModelcode all the time feels wrong when its only show occasionally.p  pThe second seems to fit MVVM better with the codeConnectProgressViewModelcode only being created when its needed, but it places more functionality onto the parent, and also the generic Overlay property feels a bit weird too.p  pCheersp  pstrongEDITstrong p  pI should clarify that this view does more than just show busy status.

Negative 355 pThe goal is to convert every pair of bytes as a single unsigned 16bit int. In C I would define an array[500] of 16bit unsinged int pointer and would point it the the array of bytes, but in java I am not aware of such short cut. I know in Java there is no 16bit data type except char, however that is not an issue. We only need to copy every two consecutive two bytes into a single int of an array of integers. So the array of integer holds values of int ranging from 0 to 65535 2161.p

The access restriction to these fields will be Update and Redacted, thus meaning if a specific field has true against Update then a user will be able to update the field as well as viewing it, and if the field has true against Redacted then the user will only be able to see a redacted value in the filed possibly asterisks      . It will be possible to set a field to being Updateable and Redacted, thus meaning a user will see the redacted view but still be able to go and update the field with a new value.

Then the number of possible combinations of the scores is 3 0,2 2,0 1,1, where a,b stands for the number of wins for player one and player two, respectively. A combination of 3,0 wouldnt work because no person can have 3 wins. Nor would 0,0 work because we need a total of 3 wins and wouldnt get it with 0,0.p  pIve found the total possible number of games. This is the total number of games played, which means it is the total number of wins. There are no ties. Finally, I have a variable for the max wins per player which is one less than the total number of players. No player can have more than that.p  pIve tried finding the number of unique combinations by spreading out N wins to each player and then subtracting combinations that dont fit the criteria. E.g., to figure out many ways to give 10 victories to 5 people with no more than 4 victories to each person, you would use  C14,4  C5,1C9,4  C5,2C4,4  381. C14,4 comes from the formula Cnk1, k1 google bars and strips, I believe. The next is picking off the the ones with the 5 not allowed, but adding in the ones we subtracted twice.p  pYeah, there has got to be an easier way. Lastly, the numbers get so big that Im not sure that my computer can adequately handle them. Were talking about C780, 39, which is 1.15495183  1066. Regardless, there should be a better way of doing this.p  pTo recap, you have 40 people. The scores of the first 30 people are 10  39. The last ten people have unknown scores. How many scores can you generate that are meet the criteria all the scores add up to total possible wins and each player gets no more 39 wins.p  pThoughts p

Negative 355 pIve been working on an assignment and now Im stuck with buggy destructors. I have to create a generic binary tree with all the usual member functions and some special operators. Theres also a restriction everything must work iteratively so no nasty recursive hacks this time.p  pThere is obviously something very wrong with the destructor of BinTreeNode class because if I delete the node like thisp  precodeBinTreeNodeltintgt  node  new BinTreeNodeltintgt delete node  codepre  pI can still access its datap  precodenodegtgetData should fail miserably codepre  pso deletion has no effect but I have no usable idea how I should correct the destructor.

For example, in order to calculate codegcd9,6code, codegcd6,3code is called as an intermediate result.

Negative 355 pI have a simple problem I have a struct Coordinates3D which is basically a 3D Point, but it also checks for boundaries. It has static maxX and minX and so on members, and checks the assigned coordinate value to fit the boundaries. It also has a boolean checkboundaries, if this is false then it wont check boundaries and allow any values for coordinates. It looks basically like thisp  precode  struct Coordinate3D      public bool checkboundaries     private int x     public int X       get return x        set           if checkboundaries                       ... check minmax ...                  x  value                  ... y and x follow...    codepre  pI want to edit this object in propertyGrid it is a property of a class. However, some classes have coordinates that are bounded, some not. So, for some classes, boundaries must be checked, but not for others. However, when i change this structs property in propertyGrid, it seems to create a new struct each time. Therefore, it is either check boundaries for all cases or do not check boundaries for all cases, depending on whats set in the constructor. p  pIs there any way around thisp

Negative 355 pI have an SSIS 2005 package that transforms some XML data and then imports it into SQL 2005. The column that the data goes to is nvarcharmax. The length of the data varies between 500 chars and 750 chars. When viewing the XML file that get created for import after the transform XSLT in Notepad  it is not truncated. the very next step in the package is the import to SQL Server. The data in the table after the import get truncated to about 450 or so chars. I know that in query analyzer  you may not see all the data so I generated a script using SQL MGT Studio to script the table and the data and then viewed that in Notepad  and sure enough  the data had been truncated.p  pThe SSIS package uses an XML Datasource to grab the transformed file.

However, qsort is shockingly inefficient at execution time. The alternative, using stdsort is shockingly inefficient during compile time due to its templates and stlblubblasugar.p  pI did some performance test for execution for the following structp  precodestruct MyStruct  int x long z bool operatorltconst struct MyStructamp other const  return x lt other.x  xother.xampampzltother.z   codepre  p1MB data runtimesp  ul listdsort 5 msli liqsort 14 msli liselfwritten 6 msli ul  p1GB data runtimesp  ul listdsort 8.9 sli liqsort 24 sli liselfwritten 10.1 sli ul  pUnfortunately i do not have JIT compile times right now, but will post them in the future.p  pCurrently it seems that my self written sort is better than qsort or stdsort, but i would rather like to use some library implementation.p  pDo you have any proposals on existing sort implementations which would be both fast in execution and for compilation Or are there maybe any other possibilities to speed up compiliation while having a fast sorting only compile comparision function or something like thatp  pBy the way, here is my selfwritten stolen from a hrefhttpalienryderflex.comquicksort relnofollowhttpalienryderflex.comquicksorta sort routine for JITing, i would not use a template Type but replacing it directly with the custom type, including ltp  precodetemplatelt typename Type gt void selfwrittensortType arr, int elements      define  MAXLEVELS  64     Type piv     int beg[MAXLEVELS], end[MAXLEVELS], i0, L, R, swap    beg[0]0 end[0]elements   while igt0      Lbeg[i] Rend[i]1     if LltR        pivarr[L]       while LltR          while arr[R]gtpiv ampamp LltR R if LltR arr[L]arr[R]         while pivltarr[L] ampamp LltR L if LltR arr[R]arr[L]        arr[L]piv beg[i1]L1 end[i1]end[i] end[i]L       if end[i]beg[i]gtend[i1]beg[i1]          swapbeg[i] beg[i]beg[i1] beg[i1]swap         swapend[i] end[i]end[i1] end[i1]swap      else        i  codepre

Negative 355 pOk, I searched for the better part of 2 hours earlier today and was unable to find an answer to my question. So I will attempt to see if you all can help me out. p  pSo what I want to do is create a trigger that on insert into table A will check to see if what is being inserted is in table B, if it is then do NOT insert it into any tables, just ignore the insert, otherwise continue inserting into table A. p  pFor example, [actually very similar to my problem just different names etc] p  pSay I have Table A and Table B. Table B consists of say Name and Address. Table A contains Name, Address, favorite color, and about 34 more misc columns. p  pI want to insert Sue, PO Box 1 Lunar Avenue, Grey, etc into table A. But lowandbehold there is already a Sue, PO Box 1 Lunar Avenue combination in table B, so i want to ignore that insert and continue.p  pNeither Name or Address is a key of any sort, other than there is a constraint on the table that will not allow any Name and Address combination to be a duplicate. p  pI am using SQL Server 2008 R2 for a reference point. p  pThank you ahead of time for your answers p

Negative 355 pA friend of mine is in the party decor business  hes something of a mad scientist when it comes to building cool decor.

Hed ideally like the rig to sync to music  I was wondering how one would go about this p  pI googled around for music program APIs for a bit  I imagine that Id write something that hopefully was able to listen for a music track playing a tone below a certain frequency, and then somehow getting the computer to tell the valve to turn on or off it only has to be one or the other to alternate the liquid and the air.p  pAs for my knowledge, regarding machine or assembly code, its nonexistant. I develop for web, and know Python and JS, but I think Id be able to learn something more robust if need be, and it wasnt too difficult an example. So some sort of solution or direction involving those languages would be easiest p  pstrongEDIT Im looking for a way to detect the beat, and turn a switch on or off with itstrongp

I then include the app.js to be outputted in my strongserversidestrong MVC application not to be confused with the strongclientsidestrong Ext JS MVC structure. The language used and structure of the serverside application is of no importance to this question, but the result of the output is. In development, the URL of the application isp  precodehttpservernamesomeidentifier1someidentifier2 codepre  pAs in many applications, modrewrite is used to give meaning to the identifiers and map the URL to serverside code. These identifiers strongdo notstrong map to physical directories. The output of this URL isp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt lttitlegtMyApplicationlttitlegt ltlink hrefextjs4.1.1resourcescssextalldebug.css mediascreen relstylesheet typetextcss gt ltscript typetextjavascript srcextjs4.1.1extdebug.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcmyapplicationapp.jsgtltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pExt JS is not at the default recommended location, being wwwrootmyapplicationextjs4.1.1, but instead one level up since it is shared between multiple applications. If you look back at the app.js above, you also notice the appFolder setting which needs to be set in order for this to work with the non existing URL.p  pThis all works fine in development, but the next step is to generate a build of the code with the a hrefhttpwww.sencha.comproductssdktools relnofollowSencha SDK Toolsa question is based on version 2.0.0 Beta 3 for Windows.

In this case because it tries to find the custom code for e.g. controllers in the path c...myapplicationmyapplicationappcontroller the current path  the appFolder setting. You would assume running it one level higher would be better, but then it cannot find the shared extjs4.1.1 directory.p  pI would guess time will make the Ext JS MVC structure and SDK Tools more flexible and deviating slightly from the default structure is not recommended. All acceptable, but on the other hand integrating Ext JS 4.x Ext JS in an MVC way with URL rewriting modrewrite must be a very common practice toop  pAny suggested working set upstructure would be highly appreciated.p  pGoals should bep  ul liNo manual editing of the jsb3 file.li liKeeping the extjs4.1.1 directory at the top level to be shared among applications.li liHaving no app.html file since it is never used in serverside MVC applications and would otherwise require manual updates.li liA nice extra would be to have the content of app.js inside the serverside generated HTML since it would then be able to receive dynamically generated parameters.li ul

Negative 355 pIn a sqlite based core data storage I have 2 entities Item and Tag.p  pItem has a many to many relationship to Tag. Tag also has a recursive relationship for one parent tag. Hence tags form a tree.p  pNow I want to create a NSPredicate to fetch all items which have all the tags in a list of criteria tags.p  pThe problem now is that the criteria should also be met if the item does not have a tag of the criteria list but a tag which is below the criteria tag in the tag tree.p  pI could expand the criteria list to include all descendants. But this would explode the list to enormous size as the tree a big.p  pOne theoretic solution would be a Fetched Property in Tag ancestors which is self joined with parent.ancestors.

Negative 355 pIve got an ItemsControl in XAML where I am displaying an expander for each group so I can expandcollapse the group. I want to persist the state of the codeIsExpandedcode property and potentially other settings relating to the display of the group header. Normally you just have a class with the properties on it and bind to this. However, the data context for the group is codeCollectionViewGroupcode. Now this class isnt very helpful as it only gives you the Name property and the items in the group which is fine if you just want a heading and maybe display some sort of metric based on the number of items in the group or their contents but not if you just want to store custom data about the state of the group header UI. What Id like to do is to derive from this class and add other properties to my derived class and bind to that instead. But there doesnt seem to be any easy way to do this. All the details of group generation seem to be hidden away in internal classes which is very frustrating. Has anyone gone down the route of implementing codeICollectionViewcode themselves and therefore all the other related classes as well presumably It seems like a massive job to replicate everything in codeListCollectionViewcode just to be able to create a custom codeCollectionViewGroupcode class and bind to that instead Thanks.p

Negative 355 pI am designing a video pixel data processing pipeline in VHDL which involves several steps including multiply and divide.

I can see how to bind to a simple property, but binding to a collection seems a bit more of a head spinner as I am creating a whole new collection everytime an item string is added.p  pFurthermore, when I load an entirely new model I have to run the NotifyPropertyChanged method on all the properties which doesnt make sense to me.p  pAny guidance is much appreciated.p  precodepublic class MediaCacherConfig  IConfig       public string DatabaseFileName  get set       public ICollectionltstringgt FoldersToScan  get set       public ICollectionltstringgt ExtensionsToIgnore  get set    codepre  pI have a viewmodel codeMediaCacherConfigViewModelcodep  precode    public class MediaCacherConfigViewModel  PropertyChangedBase       private MediaCacherConfig Model  get set       public string DatabaseFileName              get  return Model.DatabaseFileName          set                      Model.DatabaseFileName  value             NotifyOfPropertyChange gt DatabaseFileName                    public BindableCollectionltstringgt FoldersToScan              get                      return new BindableCollectionltstringgtModel.FoldersToScan                  set                      Model.FoldersToScan  value             NotifyOfPropertyChange gt FoldersToScan                    public BindableCollectionltstringgt ExtensionsToIgnore              get                      return new BindableCollectionltstringgtModel.ExtensionsToIgnore                  set                      Model.ExtensionsToIgnore  value             NotifyOfPropertyChange gt ExtensionsToIgnore                     Constructor      public MediaCacherConfigViewModel              LoadSampleConfig            Methods      public void LoadSampleConfig               MediaCacherConfig c  new MediaCacherConfig          string sampleDatabaseFileName  testing.config          Listltstringgt sampleFoldersToScan  new Listltstringgt         sampleFoldersToScan.AddA         sampleFoldersToScan.AddB         sampleFoldersToScan.AddC          Listltstringgt sampleExtensionsToIgnore  new Listltstringgt         sampleExtensionsToIgnore.Addtxt         sampleExtensionsToIgnore.Addmov         sampleExtensionsToIgnore.Adddb         sampleExtensionsToIgnore.Adddat          c.DatabaseFileName  sampleDatabaseFileName         c.FoldersToScan  sampleFoldersToScan         c.ExtensionsToIgnore  sampleExtensionsToIgnore          Model  c          NotifyOfPropertyChange gt DatabaseFileName         NotifyOfPropertyChange gt FoldersToScan         NotifyOfPropertyChange gt ExtensionsToIgnore             public void AddNewFolder              Model.FoldersToScan.Addnew one added         NotifyOfPropertyChange gt FoldersToScan            public void SaveConfig              ConfigTools.ConfigurePath.CombineEnvironment.GetFolderPathEnvironment.SpecialFolder.CommonApplicationData, Cacher, Config          ConfigTools.SaveConfigModel,sampleconfig.txt                         public void LoadConfig              ConfigTools.ConfigurePath.CombineEnvironment.GetFolderPathEnvironment.SpecialFolder.CommonApplicationData, Cacher, Config          MediaCacherConfig m  ConfigTools.LoadConfigltMediaCacherConfiggtsampleconfig.txt as MediaCacherConfig         Model  m           NotifyOfPropertyChange gt DatabaseFileName         NotifyOfPropertyChange gt FoldersToScan         NotifyOfPropertyChange gt ExtensionsToIgnore        codepre  pAnd here is my viewp  precodeltUserControl xClassMediaCacher.Views.MediaCacherConfigView          xmlnshttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xamlpresentation          xmlnsxhttpschemas.microsoft.comwinfx2006xaml          xmlnsmchttpschemas.openxmlformats.orgmarkupcompatibility2006           xmlnsdhttpschemas.microsoft.comexpressionblend2008           mcIgnorabled           dDesignHeight413 Width300gt ltGrid MinWidth300 MinHeight300 BackgroundLightBlue Margin0,0,0,0gt     ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt         ltRowDefinition Height409gt         ltRowDefinition Height4gt     ltGrid.RowDefinitionsgt     ltTextBox xNameDatabaseFileName TextWrappingWrap Margin10,64,10,0 HorizontalAlignmentCenter Width280 Height42 VerticalAlignmentTopgt     ltListBox xNameFoldersToScan HorizontalAlignmentLeft Height145 Margin10,111,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTop Width280gt     ltListBox xNameExtensionsToIgnore HorizontalAlignmentLeft Height145 Margin10,261,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTop Width280gt     ltButton xNameAddNewFolder ContentAdd HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin10,10,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTop Width87 Height49gt     ltButton xNameLoadConfig ContentLoad HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin102,10,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTop Width96 Height49gt     ltButton xNameSaveConfig ContentSave HorizontalAlignmentLeft Margin203,10,0,0 VerticalAlignmentTop Width87 Height49gt ltGridgt codepre  pp

Negative 355 pI am working on an isometric 2d game and one aspect of it will be units that shoot projectiles. If the projectiles are circular its not to bad. Just position the projectile in isometric space. But what if the projectile is long like a missile or an arrowp  pI want to make it sort of look as if it is rotating or rather flying through 3d space not necessarily screen oriented. It doesnt need to be perfect since I am not doing this in 3d. I have a few options that I know of. p  pA I could scale the image somehow based on the arc or rather the vector the projectile is traveling. I am actually not quite sure how the math for this would work though and how bad it may look. p  pB I could rotate the actual sprite in 3D space. This method is tricky because there will be angles in which the sprite becomes invisible to the camera. This would be an undesired effect. p  pC I could get sprites rendered for key rotations and display them. With this method I am not sure how rotating the sprites normally will affect the look.p  pDoes anyone know of any good examples or ideas on solving this problem What would be the best solution to render these sprites so that a projectile can launch from any point or land at any point on the isometric plane.p

Heres the web.xml snippetp  precodeltfiltergt     ltfilternamegtjerseyserlvetltfilternamegt     ltfilterclassgt         com.sun.jersey.spi.spring.container.servlet.SpringServlet     ltfilterclassgt     ltinitparamgt         ltparamnamegt             com.sun.jersey.config.property.packages         ltparamnamegt         ltparamvaluegtcom.foocom.barltparamvaluegt     ltinitparamgt     ltinitparamgt         ltparamnamegtcom.sun.jersey.config.feature.FilterForwardOn404ltparamnamegt         ltparamvaluegttrueltparamvaluegt     ltinitparamgt ltfiltergt  ltfiltermappinggt     ltfilternamegtjerseyserlvetltfilternamegt     lturlpatterngtlturlpatterngt ltfiltermappinggt codepre  pThis setup works, but I really want to get this set up with annotations only  no web.xml config.  My first attempt at this was to remove the above SpringServlet configuration and create a class that extends codeApplicationcode.  Heres a snippet of thatp  precodeApplicationPath public class MyApplication extends PackagesResourceConfig       public MyApplication          supercom.foocom.bar          HashMapltString, Objectgt settings  new HashMapltString, Objectgt1         settings.putServletContainer.FEATUREFILTERFORWARDON404, true         this.setPropertiesAndFeaturessettings       codepre  pThis works in that the JAXRS resources are registered and I can hit them at their URLs, but they throw NullPointerExceptions when they try and use their autowired properties... this makes sense because Im guessing the resources are now being loaded by Jersey and are not Spring managed beans, therefore no autowiring.  p  pDespite a fair bit of searching around I cannot find any way of loading the Jersey resources as Spring beans with annotations only.  bIs there such a wayb  I dont really want to have to write a bunch of code for the resources to manually fetch the Spring context and invoke the DI if I can help it.p  pIf annotationsonly isnt going to work, then I can live with the filter config in web.xml if I can specify an codeApplicationcode class to load instead of a list of packages to scan.  If I can get rid of the package list in there and just specify an codeApplicationcode class instance then Ill be content.p  pObviously it would be great if someone had a definitive answer for me but Id also be grateful for any pointers or hints of where else I could look or things to try.p  pThanks, Mattp
Negative 355 pIm looking for a good solution to constantly read files within a directory in my windows service. Currently, Im using FileSystemWatcher to process xml files that get added to the directory.This works well when the service is running. However, if the services gets stopped for whatever reason, the files that were added to the directory while the service was stopped never get processed. Whats the best possible solution Below is the code I have for FileSystemWatcher. Maybe FileSystemWatcher can do this, however, I could be using it incorrectly.p  precode            Setup FileSystemWatcher to watch IN directory...

Also, 34 leads to an error as well.

This is because ProjectC does not reference any symbols relating to the tests from ProjectB, so the linker doesnt link the object files from ProjectB.lib.p  pIt is my understanding that if ProjectB was an executable, I would not have this issue presumably because the linker would link all the object files, as per the documentationp  blockquote   pThe general idea is that you keep one Main.cpp file with the   entrypoint which calls RunAllTests.p      pThen you can simply compile and link new .cpp files at will, typically   one per test suite.p      pEach of the Test.cpp files will contain one or more TEST macro incantations with the associated   test code. There are no sourcelevel dependencies between Main.cpp and   Test.cpp, as the TEST macro handles the registration and setup   necessary for RunAllTests to find all tests compiled into the same   final executable.p blockquote  pHow can I resolve this problem without having to declare all the tests in header files that ProjectC can see which would kill UnitTests ease of use One possibility Ive noticed in Visual Studio isp  pProject Settings  Configuration Properties  Linker  Input  Force Symbol Referencesp  pHowever it would be rather tedious to have to add every single symbol, every time I write a new unit test. Is there some way I can force it to include the entire contents of ProjectB.lib Or perhaps some codebased solutionp  pEDIT What Im looking for is something like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions805555ldlinkerquestionthewholearchiveoptionthisa but for Visual Studio.p

With my last pc using WinXP I was able to force the port number if needed to make it work but that isnt happening here.p  pAny suggestionsp

Negative 355 pI have never used CGAL and have got almost no CC experience. But following Google I have however managed to compile the example Alphashapes3 CGAL4.1beta1examplesAlphashapes3 on a Windows 7 64bit machine using visual studio 2010.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comXwvgm.png altenter image description herep  pNow if we check the source code for the program exalphashapes3 we notice that a data file called bunny1000 is red where the 3d point cluster resides. Now my question is how can I change the source code so that after the alpha shape is computed for the given points, surface mesh of the alpha shape is savedwrote in an external file. It can be simply the list of polygons and their respective 3D vertices. I guess these polygons will be defining the surface mesh of the alpha shape. If I can do that I can see the output of the alpha shape generation program in an external tool I am familiar with.p  pI know this is very straightforward but I could not figure this out with my limited knowledge of CGAL.p  pI know you gueys have the code but I am pasting it again for completion.p  precodeinclude ltCGALExactpredicatesinexactconstructionskernel.hgt include ltCGALDelaunaytriangulation3.hgt include ltCGALAlphashape3.hgt  include ltfstreamgt include ltlistgt include ltcassertgt  typedef CGALExactpredicatesinexactconstructionskernel Gt  typedef CGALAlphashapevertexbase3ltGtgt          Vb typedef CGALAlphashapecellbase3ltGtgt            Fb typedef CGALTriangulationdatastructure3ltVb,Fbgt  Tds typedef CGALDelaunaytriangulation3ltGt,Tdsgt       Triangulation3 typedef CGALAlphashape3ltTriangulation3gt         Alphashape3  typedef GtPoint3                                  Point typedef Alphashape3Alphaiterator               Alphaiterator  int main    stdlistltPointgt lp    read input   stdifstream is.databunny1000   int n   is gtgt n   stdcout ltlt Reading  ltlt n ltlt  points  ltlt stdendl   Point p   for  ngt0  n         is gtgt p     lp.pushbackp        compute alpha shape   Alphashape3 aslp.begin,lp.end   stdcout ltlt Alpha shape computed in REGULARIZED mode by default             ltlt stdendl     find optimal alpha value   Alphaiterator opt  as.findoptimalalpha1   stdcout ltlt Optimal alpha value to get one connected component is              ltlt  opt    ltlt stdendl   as.setalphaopt   assertas.numberofsolidcomponents  1   return 0   codepre  pAfter searching a lot in the internet I found that probably we need to use something like p  precodestdlistltFacetgt facets alphashape.getalphashapefacets    stdbackinserterfacets,AlphashapeREGULAR  codepre  pBut I am still completely clueless how to use this in the above codep

If I enter login credientials in the program, I can stream live video from the AXIS camera. If I dont enter any login credientials, I can find the camera, but not stream any video. So based on this I concluded that the camera is correct configured.p  pI think it has something to do with login credientials on the binding, but cant figure out what is wrong.p  pMy code looks like thisp  precodeprivate void CustomBinding2          try                      const string SERVICEADDRESSDIRECT  http192.168.1.72onvifdeviceservice 400 bad request             const string USERNAME  cbk             const string PASSWORD  12              HttpTransportBindingElement httpTransportBindingElement  new HttpTransportBindingElement             httpTransportBindingElement.MaxReceivedMessageSize  Int32.MaxValue             httpTransportBindingElement.KeepAliveEnabled  false             httpTransportBindingElement.MaxBufferSize  Int32.MaxValue             httpTransportBindingElement.ProxyAddress  null             httpTransportBindingElement.BypassProxyOnLocal  true             httpTransportBindingElement.UseDefaultWebProxy  false             httpTransportBindingElement.TransferMode  TransferMode.StreamedResponse             httpTransportBindingElement.AuthenticationScheme  AuthenticationSchemes.Basic              TextMessageEncodingBindingElement messegeElement  new TextMessageEncodingBindingElement             messegeElement.MessageVersion  MessageVersion.CreateVersionEnvelopeVersion.Soap12, AddressingVersion.None              CustomBinding binding  new CustomBindingmessegeElement, httpTransportBindingElement             binding.CloseTimeout  TimeSpan.FromSeconds30.0             binding.OpenTimeout  TimeSpan.FromSeconds30.0             binding.SendTimeout  TimeSpan.FromMinutes10.0             binding.ReceiveTimeout  TimeSpan.FromMinutes3.0              EndpointAddress serviceAddress  new EndpointAddressSERVICEADDRESSDIRECT              ChannelFactoryltDevicegt channelFactory  new ChannelFactoryltDevicegtbinding, serviceAddress             channelFactory.Credentials.UserName.UserName  USERNAME             channelFactory.Credentials.UserName.Password  PASSWORD              Device channel  channelFactory.CreateChannel              string model, firmwareVersion, serialNumber, hardwareId             channel.GetDeviceInformationout model, out firmwareVersion, out serialNumber, out hardwareId             MessageBox.Showstring.FormatModel 0, model                  catch Exception e                      MessageBox.Showe.Message           codepre

Negative 355 pSo, I have a set of interdependent .c and .h files, and Im trying to figure out exactly how CCtoPascal works my delphipascal work otherwise was pretty basic. The c files are steps 1N in order of a mathematical algorithm each one is a separate function, one header specifies the variables used in each function Im using coderecordcode to recreate the .h files in delphi, and the other header details a custom variable type. The goal is to access the functions without having to rewrite the C code into PascalDelphi syntax, linking from delphi code to some existing c.

Negative 355 pIm creating an interface in Python using Tkinter, which consists of a few text entry boxes and a button which has a callback function to process the data that has been entered. In order to improve the user experience, I wanted to make it so that in addition to being able to click the button, the user could also press the return key while focused on any of the text entry boxes to submit their data. p  pI tried using the bind method on each of the entry widgets, supplying the key code for return as the first argument and the name of the callback function as the second, but for some reason Im getting an exception because it says the function expects no argument but is being given 1. Why is this binding giving an argument to the function, and is there any way I can prevent this Thanks in advance.p

Negative 355 pI really would like to start getting into Objective C coding, specifically so I can write applications for iOS.p  pMy coding background is that I have written C .NET GUI Windows apps and PHP web scripts for years Ive also become a very good Python coder in the past year. I have written hundreds of useful commandline Python scripts, and also a few GUI apps using wxPython successfully. I also wrote VB6 GUI apps way back in the day, and of course, I cut my teeth on QuickBASIC in DOS. p  pI understand OOP concepts I understand classes, methods, properties and the like. I use OOP a lot in Python, and obviously use it extensively in C.p  pI havent actually taken the time to really get good at C or C, however I am able to write simple test programs to accomplish small tasks. The problem is that I understand the strongsyntaxstrong just fine, but the APIs can be very different depending on platform, and accomplishing the same thing in C on Linux at the command line is totally different than accomplishing it in Windows in a GUI.p  pIve looked over a few books out there for iOS coding but they seem to assume little to no programming knowledge and quickly bore me, and I cant easily find the information I really need buried among all of the heres what an object is or this is called a class and a method stuff...p  pI also tried the Stanford lectures on iTunes U, but I found myself struggling with the MVC concepts and the idea of setting up different files for implementation and header and all of that...p  pIs there any resources that you guys can think of that would be good for me to get started with iOS p  pIts also worth noting I have dabbled with PyObjC a little on Mac and therefore do understand a LITTLE about the NS foundation classes and such, and Ive also looked at Apples reference documentation and Im sure that once I get the basics down I could put good use to it, but I still dont know how to actually get a functional iOS app that does something useful going. p

Negative 355 pI am fairly new to programming and I have a question about class access. Say that I create a class called TheClass with a bunch of public variables and public methods. I then create several other toplevel classes that need access to the methodsvariables of an instance of TheClass. So, when I create an instance of TheClass and I want to access the variables of that instance by other toplevel classes, then it is my understanding that I can p  pPass the new instance of TheClass into the constructor of each of the other classes when they are created so they can access those variables inside of the instance of TheClass like this p  precodeTheClass theClass  new TheClass   OtherClass otherClass  new OtherClasstheClass codepre  pAlternatively, I could nest all of the other classes inside of TheClass thereby giving them access to the variables of theClass instance... I think p  pFinally, I could make variablesmethods of TheClass static thereby giving other classes outside of TheClass access to them, however this is no good because I need access to the variables of the instance of TheClass that is running. p  pThe reason Im asking is because I recently created my first big program and I was passing an instance of a class object into a large number of other classes and It became quite a chore just following it around. I felt like I was doing something wrong. Have I overlooked something huge with regards to accessing instance variables of a class from other toplevel classesp  pI am a long ways away from understanding even the basics of Java programming but this is a question that keeps surfacing for me so I thought I would ask it here. p

Negative 355 pI am learning twitter bootstrap 3 these days. There is a class called active in bootstrap. I have seen this feature even in CSS. As I know it indicates the active page or link probably it is the page that we are currently in. Please correct me if I am wrong. What I need to know is why we need to call such a class in our markup. Because it is upto the user to decide which page that he needs to be in.p  pIf I explain this further below markup has used classactive in the 2nd list element. i.e Profile. When I run the code in a browser it adds a nice blue background to Profile. strongWhy should I add such a class Active tabs vary when users navigate from one tab to another.

Negative 355 pIm currently encountering a problem with false validations on the return of my function. amp Ive narrowed it down to the following line p  precodeif UserID  null    return false  codepre  pNow, im performing some queries using MySQLi p  precodeQuery  thisgtDatabasegtprepareSELECT ID,Username,Password,Salt,UserStatus FROM users WHERE Username Querygtbindparams,Username Querygtexecute QuerygtbindresultUserID,Username,UserPassword,UserSalt,UserStatus Querygtfetch Querygtclose codepre  pAfter fetching, I noticed that if there is no data detected from the queries, the bound results will return a null instead of actual data, but the problem is sometimes this isnt working for some reason as it allows access to the members area because of some type of validation being seen wrong from the code, im guessing its the codereturncode statements either false or an array. So to tweak the performance and want to attempt to remove the codeNULLcode check.p  pStandard procedure for what ive currently implemented is as follows p  precodeUserChk  thisgtDatabasegtprepareSELECT COUNTID FROM users WHERE username UserChkgtbindparams,Username UserChkgtexecute UserChkgtbindresultCount UserChkgtfetch UserChkgtclose  if UserChk  1      Query  thisgtDatabasegtprepareSELECT ID,Username,Password,Salt,UserStatus FROM users WHERE Username     Querygtbindparams,Username     Querygtexecute     QuerygtbindresultUserID,Username,UserPassword,UserSalt,UserStatus     Querygtfetch     Querygtclose     return array                 UserID gt UserID,                 Username gt Username,                 Password gt UserPassword,                 Salt gt UserSalt,                 Status gt UserStatus                  return false codepre  pBut.. As ive always followed the rule of let MySQL do the work before PHP has to manipulate.. To be frank, im not that savvy with MySQL QueriesKeywords..

Negative 355 pI have a Custom DatModule say TMyDataModule to which I wished to add a published property an enumerated type so that the property would be accessible in the Object Inspector at least for descendants.p  pI added the unit to an existing designtime package and added registration code like RegisterCustomModuleTMyDataModule, TCustomModule uninstalled, rebuilt, reinstalled the package. p  pWhen I open an existing DataModule that was created by inheriting from TMyDataModule, the property shows up in the OI. So far so good.p  pBUT any existing or newly created DMs that wereare created by inheriting from TMydataModule, once they  are created, they no longer inherit from TMyDatModule. If I edit the DFM for any of these descendants and try to change the opening object back to inherited, Delphi just changes it back when I exit the DFM. p  pAnd components  defined on TMyDataModule no longer appear on the form at designtime and one cannot reference them e.g. when setting properties etc. They are accessible in code, but ....p  pAs requested, an example. p  pThis is the parent class TMyDataModulep  precode  TdmSQLBase  classTDataModule     sspMeta TSQLStoredProc     dspMeta TDataSetProvider     cdMeta TClientDataSet     dsMeta TDataSource     conMeta TSQLConnection     cdAllIndexes TClientDataSet     sdsMeta TSQLDataSet     procedure DataModuleCreateSender TObject     procedure SQLConnectionBeforeConnectSender TObject      procedure CDSAfterPostUpdDataSet TDataSet     procedure CDSBeforeCloseDataSet TDataSet     procedure CDSBeforeRefreshDataSet TDataSet       ......................  etc etc etc ....................   published     property DBApplication  TDBApplication read FDBApplication write FDBApplication default daHeadOffice    end  var   dmSQLBase TdmSQLBase  nil  This is a descendant originally inherited from the above   type   TdmDBCheck  classTdmSQLBase     cddata TClientDataSet     dspData TDataSetProvider     sdsData TSQLDataSet     conData TSQLConnection     dsData TDataSource     cdDatabase TClientDataSet     dsDatabase TDataSource     dspDataBase TDataSetProvider     sdsDatabase TSQLDataSet     dspIndex TDataSetProvider     conINdex TSQLConnection     sdsIndex TSQLDataSet     cdIndex TClientDataSet     dsIndex TDataSource     cdAllTest TClientDataSet      ............... etc etc etc .....   end  var   dmDBCheck TdmDBCheck codepre  hr  pNow, before registering the custom module, one could at designtime e.g. assign the SQLconnection property of sdsData to say conMeta defined on the parent and it would apprear in the dropdown list of connections just as conMeta. Lets not get into the desirablility of doing that. With the Custom Module registered, conMeta does not appear in the OI for the descendant. However, dmSQLBase.conMeta does. BUT selecting this will likely give an AV at runtime, unless one instantiates the parent separately  which rather defeats the purpose and is yukky anyway. p  pThe problem, which is not huge, is that for some existing descendants their DFMs will contain references like conMeta in the above example. With the module registered, delphi dropsignores  those references as they are invalid so they become nil pointers at runtime.p  pI am actually coming around to the view that the behaviour with the module registered is cleaner. Those components like conMeta also do not appear on the childs form which is a plus. But if I retain the registration I need to find and correct any such references, and I just want to understand what the hell is going on.p
Negative 355 pOkay, so Im trying to copy an existing model as a new model instance so all attributes are the same except for its ID.

Negative 355 pOn modern multicore platforms parallel performance of memory bandwidth bounded applications often does not scale well with the number of cores. Usually, speedup is observed up to some number of cores, but after that the performance saturates.

So when I have this the Destination is a single, now I want to select witch month, or port or Ship I want to use and so on.p  pI hope you understand.p  pEDITED It seems it is not the problem with ajax but with Jquery event not fiering up after ajax returns values. p  pThe code I have isp  pAjaxp  precodeltscriptgt var xmlhttp  function showUserdest,mese,port,ladja  xmlhttpGetXmlHttpObject  if xmlhttpnull      alert Browser does not support HTTP Request   return    var urlremote.php urlurldestdestampmesemeseampportportampladjaladja urlurlampsidMath.random xmlhttp.onreadystatechangestateChanged xmlhttp.openGET,url,true xmlhttp.send   function stateChanged  if xmlhttp.readyState4  document.getElementByIdcontent.innerHTMLxmlhttp.responseText    function GetXmlHttpObject  if window.XMLHttpRequest       code for IE7, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari   return new XMLHttpRequest    if window.ActiveXObject       code for IE6, IE5   return new ActiveXObjectMicrosoft.XMLHTTP    return null  ltscriptgt codepre  pPHPp  precodeltdiv idsrcgt     ltdiv idmaingt         ltdiv idcontentgt             ltform namesrc idsrcform methodpost  actionresult.phpgt             ltdiv idlin1 classlingtltphp Destinacija gtltdivgt             ltdiv idlin2 classlingtltphp Mesec gtltdivgt             ltdiv idlin3 classlingtltphp Pristanisce gtltdivgt             ltdiv idlin4 classlingtltphp Ladja gtltdivgt             ltdiv idlin5gtltbutton idsrc typesubmitgtIiltbuttongtltdivgt            ltformgt           ltdivgt     ltdivgt ltdivgt  ltscriptgt                 content.onchange, .lin, functionevent                 event.preventDefault                 console.log  this .text                      showUserdocument.getElementByIddest.value,document.getElementByIdmese.value,document.getElementByIdport.value,document.getElementByIdladja.value                           ltscriptgt                 ltphp includeajax.php gt ltphp     function Destinacija              includeclassclass.Translateinl.php         tr  new Translateinldestcode         includeincludesconSql.php                  result  mysqliquerycon,SELECT DISTINCT regioncode FROM noairpricing          echo ltselect namedest iddestgt.PHPEOL         echo ltoption value0gtDestinacijaltoptiongt.PHPEOL         whilerow  mysqlifetcharrayresult                            dest  trgtTrVarrow[regioncode]                 echoltoption value.row[regioncode].gt.dest.ltoptiongt.PHPEOL                    echo ltselectgt.PHPEOL         includeincludesdisSql.php          function Mesec                              tr  new Translateinlmeseci                       includeincludesconSql.php             mo  array             i0             result  mysqliquerycon,SELECT saildate FROM noairpricing ORDER BY saildate              whilerow  mysqlifetcharrayresult                                  month  explode,row[saildate]                   mo[i]  month[0]                   i                                          includeincludesdisSql.php              unmo  arrayuniquemo             unmo  arrayvaluesunmo             k  countunmo              echoltselect namemese idmesegt.PHPEOL             echoltoption value0gtMesec odhodaltoptiongt.PHPEOL             forj0 jltk j                            echoltoption value.unmo[j].gt.trgtTrVarunmo[j].ltoptiongt.PHPEOL                          echoltselectgt.PHPEOL              unsettr          function Pristanisce               tr  new Translateinlportcode         port  array         i0         includeincludesconSql.php               result  mysqliquerycon,SELECT departureportcode FROM noairpricing ORDER BY departureportcode               whilerow  mysqlifetcharrayresult                        port[i]  row[departureportcode]             i                        includeincludesdisSql.php          uport  arrayuniqueport         uport  arrayvaluesuport         k  countuport         echo ltselect nameport idportgt.PHPEOL         echo ltoption value0gtPristanie odhodaltoptiongt.PHPEOL                forj0 jltk j                    echoltoption value.uport[j].gt.trgtTrVaruport[j].ltoptiongt.PHPEOL                         echo ltselectgt.PHPEOL                unsettr          function Ladja               tr  new Translateinlladjekode         ladje  array         i0         includeincludesconSql.php                  result  mysqliquerycon,SELECT shipcode FROM noairpricing ORDER BY shipcode                   whilerow  mysqlifetcharrayresult                        ladje[i]  row[shipcode]             i                    includeincludesdisSql.php          uladje  arrayuniqueladje         uladje  arrayvaluesuladje         k  countuladje           echo ltselect nameladja idladjagt.PHPEOL         echo ltoption value0gtLadjaltoptiongt.PHPEOL         forj0 jltk j                    echoltoption value.uladje[j].gt.trgtTrVaruladje[j].ltoptiongt.PHPEOL                     echo ltselectgt.PHPEOL         unsettr      gt codepre  pAny help would be welcome.

Why isnt the phone field being masked anymore, am I doing something wrongp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml langengt     ltheadgt          lt Basic Page Needs gt          ltmeta charsetutf8gt         lttitlegtTest Pagelttitlegt         ltmeta httpequivcachecontrol contentnocachegt         lt Mobile Specific Metas gt          ltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1, maximumscale1, userscalable0gt         lt css gt         ltlink relstylesheet hrefcssstyle.cssgt         ltlink relstylesheet hrefcssframework.cssgt          lt Scripts gt         ltscript srchttpscode.jquery.comjquery1.8.3.min.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscript srchttpscode.jquery.commobile1.2.1jquery.mobile1.2.1.min.jsgtltscriptgt         ltscript srcmaskedinput.js typetextjavascriptgtltscriptgt          ltscript typetextjavascriptgt         jQueryfunction            phone.mask999 9999999                      ltscriptgt      ltheadgt      ltbodygt         ltdiv datarolepagegt             lt header gt             ltdiv dataroleheader classpageheadergt              ltdivgt             ltheader gt              ltform style methodPOSTgt                 ltfieldset styletextalign centergt                     ltlabel forphonegtCell Phoneltlabelgt                     ltinput typetel idphone style valueltphp ifissetPOST[phone] echo POST[phone]gt namephone gt                       ltbr gt                     ltphp                      ifissetPOST[add]                         POST[clubnum]                     ifissetPOST[remove] ampamp POST[clubnum] gt 1                         POST[clubnum]                     ifissetPOST[clubnum]                         POST[clubnum]  1                      gt                      ltinput typehidden valueltphp ifissetPOST[clubnum] echo POST[clubnum]gt nameclubnum gt                     lth3 stylefontsize 1.5em margintop 40pxgtAre you in a Clublth3gt                     ltphp                      count  0                     do                          count                         gt                          ltlabel forclubsltcountgtgtltcountgt.

Negative 355 pI have a web application that uses the jquery autocomplete plugin, which essentially sends via ajax a request containing text that has been typed into a textbox to our web server, once the web server receives this request, it is then handed off to rabbitmq. p  pI know that we do get benefits from using messaging, but it seems like using it for blocking rpc calls is a misuse and that something like WCF is far more appropriate in this instance, is this the case or is it considered acceptable architecturep
Negative 355 pI have run the query below in order to find indexes to delete.p  precodeSELECT d.name AS DatabaseName, t.name AS TableName, i.name AS IndexName, ius. FROM sys.dmdbindexusagestats ius JOIN sys.databases d ON d.databaseid  ius.databaseid JOIN sys.tables t ON t.objectid  ius.objectid JOIN sys.indexes i ON i.objectid  ius.objectid AND i.indexid  ius.indexid ORDER BY userupdates DESC codepre  pBut the result set that returns is pretty confusing. I am receiving multiple rows for the same indexes with different databaseids and therefore names. Lets say we have an index and its name is IDXName and its is IDXID. This index is under TBL1 inthe DB1 database. But there are multiple rows for this index with same index name and same index id and same table name but different database ids.p  pI double checked the Microsoft documentation and it confirms that the database id in that view is the database where the index resides. So how come I have the ids of the databases that that index does not exist inp

Negative 355 pI am using achartengine to display charts in an Android app. The app allows the user to display different datasets and different charts types depending on the selections they make from spinners.  My problem is this. The original chart displays correctly and all zoom, pan, and onClick events preform as expected. But when I remove the first chart and add another, the charts will not zoom or pan from touch and onClick  will not return selected point data. The achartengine zoom and reset buttons still display and work as expected. To remove a chart and add another I have used different variations of the following code with the same results. p  precodeprivate void repaint      mchart1LLpie  LinearLayout this.findViewByIdR.id.chart1LLpie     if mChart1ChartViewpie  null          mchart1LLpie.removeViewmChart1ChartViewpie           mChart1ChartViewpie  ChartFactory.getPieChartViewgetApplicationContext, mChart1PieSeries, mChart1PieRenderer      mchart1LLpie.addViewmChart1ChartViewpie, 0, new LayoutParamsLayoutParams.MATCHPARENT, LayoutParams.MATCHPARENT  codepre  pI have also tried to remove all the renderers and clear the data series with the following code.p  precodemChart1PieRenderer.removeAllRenderers     int size  mChart1PieSeries.getItemCount     for int i  0 i lt size i          mChart1PieSeries.remove0 codepre  pAnd then display the chart with a rebuilt dataset and renderer using the following.p  precodemChart1ChartViewpie  ChartFactory.getPieChartViewgetApplicationContext, mChart1PieSeries, mChart1PieRenderer codepre  pThe problem with this approach is that the next chart is not displayed until the display is touched.

Negative 355 pi have a problem with this code which i dont understand. there is a button with id append which when i clciked the JQuery is able to show a selected Category amp Item dropdown box values into their various textboxes which is correct but all the Items dropdown box texts are combined as one word strongemPensBookRuler etcemstrong and displayed into another textbox called itemname meanwhile the Items selected dropdown box should display the selected Item text not by combining all the the texts in the dropdown list. NB all the JQuery libraries have been referenced so i didnt include them, even though the Category select option has a change event that lists the Items options upon the Category selected and that is working fine but this code shown below is just combining all the Items texts when i click on append button instead of displaying just the selected Item text br  p  precode  Category ltselect idicateggt     ltoption value  C1gtStationaryltoptiongt     ltoption value C2gtTonerltoptiongt     ltselectgt         Items ltselect idcitemgt     ltoption valueT1gtPensltoptiongt     ltoption valueT2gtBooksltoptiongt ltoption valueT3gtRulerltoptiongt     ltselectgt      ltscriptgt append.click function       categID.trimicateg.val      categName.trimicateg.text      itemName.trimcitem.text     itemID.trimcitem.val      iqtyqty.val      additems.append         lttrgtlttdgtltinput typetext nameicateg idicateg valuecategID readonlyreadonly gt                  ltinput typetext nameicategName idicategName valuecategName gtlttdgt              lttdgtltinput typetext namecitem idcitem readonlyreadonly valueitemID gt                   ltinput typetext nameitemname iditemname readonlyreadonly valueitemName gtlttdgt             lttdgtltinput typetext nameqty idqty readonlyreadonly valueiqty gtlttdgt             lttdgtlta classremovethis hrefgtlti classiconminusgtltigtltagtlttdgtlttrgt     return false  ltscriptgt codepre

Negative 355 pSo having started with SceneKit all has gone well so far until I stumbled upon transformations, thinking that it would be like CA3d transformations on layers.p  pHowever it seems I quite wrong and transformation work quite differently with regards to how the Zaxis works.p  pFor example I am trying to accomplish a 3d orbital style movement, similar to a carousel look.

That is, it is reraised for every control.

When an event handler is invoked, it writes some information into a text block.  p  ul liWhen I click the button, all three event handlers are invoked.  li liWhen I add codee.Handled  truecode to the Preview...EventHandler, only this event handler is invoked. Even the Mouse...EventHandler is not raised, although Ive set codeUIElement.AddHandler handledEventsToocode to true.li liWhen I add codee.Handled  truecode to the Mouse...EventHandler, all three event handlers are invoked.li ul  pThat does not make any sense to me.

Negative 355 pIm trying to find a solution to a problem to guarantee that a message is only over processed completely by a single consumer. p  pLots of messages on a queue and a number of consumers read messages and process them writing out to a database. My messages are transacted so that if a consumer dies then the message goes back onto the queue for another consumer to process.p  pWe have to have an activepassive configuration for activemq and this is causing the issue. If I stop the active activemq then the consumer reconnects to the other activemq as I am using the failover transport. This is fine but during the reconnect, the message is put back on the queueand the consumer is not made aware of this reconnection and continues to process. This leads to the situation where 2 consumers process the same message.p  pI would have liked to use a distributed transaction manager and this may happen in the future but for now I need a different solution.p  pIf I dont use failover transport then I can hook into a JMSException listener and abort the consumer. Unfortunately this does not work when using failover transport. p  pI would like either to use failover transport for the initial connect discover which of the activemqs are running and then force failover not to reconnect... or use a different transport that allows a list of server to try but doesnt reconnect... or find away to listen to the reconnect.p  pNote that this happens sometimes with just one server using failover reconnect.p  pI could do my over initial connect logic hunting for the active server but was going to check if there is another optionp
Negative 355 pIm dealing with data that has been generated from a survey that has a unique respondant ID as the first column and then has multiple columns relating to the choices of country that the respondent was looking at in relation to finding employees. So my table looks something likep  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodeRespondentID  Andorra  Austria  Belgium  Cyprus  Denmark  Finland  France     2546078180    Andorra  NULL     NULL     Cyprus  NULL     NULL     NULL  2546077668    NULL     NULL     Belgium  NULL    NULL     NULL     NULL  2546077120    NULL     NULL     NULL     NULL    Denmark  Finland  NULL  codepre  pWhat I want to end up with is a table that lists the Respondent ID for each answer given.

Negative 355 pwell, I have an GeForce 740m GPU so it is the GK107 architecture 2xSMX, 64 MaxWarpsMP, 32 ThreadsWarp. So I should be able to run 2x64x32  4096 threads in one time, am I rightp  pWell Im running on my notebook the gSLIC algorithm Segmentation to superpixels.p  pFirstly I started with an image of size 640x480 and I was segmenting the image to 1200 superpixels. After the calculations the kernel was called with 1200 blocks and 256 threads per block, the result was about 95ms.p  pThen I improve the size of the block, but the calculation gives me the same amount of blocks and threads per block, 1200 and 256. The only difference was, that the algorithm allocated an extra unnecessary memory in the shared memory and the result was about 200ms. Can it be caused because of the extra memory allocation or it can be something elsep  pI would like to ask you some questions about the processing these threads.p  ol lipSo I have 1200 blocks and 256 threads per block what is 307200 threads, but I cant run them all at the same time only 4096, am I rightpli lipMax warps per mp is 64 and each warp is 32 threads, my block size is now 256, so thats mean one block is like 25632  8 warps, then on one SMX I can run at the same time 648  8 blocks in the same time, am I right pli lipDoes CUDA start to process the whole block or it can just start to process 32threads from a block of size 256 For example if I have two 256 threads block and 8 warps, is it possible that the cuda will take 128 threads from both blocks or it will always take firstly one whole block if possiblepli ol  pOr Im understanding the thread processing wrongly.p

Negative 355 pIm working with PostgreSQL now for a few months. Now before going live we usually used the live database for almost everything creating new columns in the live database tables, executing update and insert queries etc.. But now we want to go live and we have to do things differently before we do that. The best way is to have a test database and live database.p  pNow I created a copy of the live database so we have a test database to run tests on. The problem is that the data is old after 24 hours, so we actually need to create a fresh copy every 24 hours, which is not really smart to do manually.p  pSo my question is, are there people over here who know a proper way to handle this issuep  pI think the most ideal way is  copy a selection of tables from the live database to the test database skip tables like users.  make it possible to add columns, rename them or even delete them and when we deploy a new version of the website, transfer those changes from the test database to the live database net necassary but would be a good feature.p

Negative 355 pI am very newbie in programming, especially in Visual Studio. What I am intending to do is to bundle Arduion Uno board with the Faulhaber motor controller and motors. As for now, I could get the analog signal from Arduion Uno, and now trying to connect or send ASCII data to motor controller. For that I need to open COM port and send ASCII data. This all can be done using Visual Micro plugin for Visual Studio 2010.p  pI found some kind of manual, and it say like this.p  pstrongExamples to talk to the Faulhaber Motion Controllers from a PC applicationstrongp  pstrong1. VBScript in Faulhaber Motion Manager 2strongp  pWith the Faulhaber Motion Manager 2 you can create easy program sequences or automation scripts and run them on the PC within the Motion Manager See chapter Visual Basic Script Programs in the Motion Manager Online Help and the examples script.vbs and userconf.vbs in the examples directory of your Motion Manager installation.p  ol start2 liUsing the Motion Managers Mocom.dll as a communication interface to the Motion Controllers The file Mocom.dll includes a RS232 driver and several functions for the data exchange to a Faulhaber Motion Controller. The DLL can be used in any 32 bit windows application, written for example in CC, Delphi, Visual Basic, etc. For a description of the functions and an example in C, see the file Mocome.doc. The header file Mocom.h is prepared for CC applications and has to be adapted for other programming languages.li ol  pstrong3. Writing a own communication interface in your programming languagestrongp  pIf your programming language supports functions for the RS232 port, it is easy to communicate to the Motion Controllers. For that you have to open the COM port you want to use e.g. COM1 or COM2 with the given baudrate e.g. 9600 and after that you can write the characters of the Motion Controller ASCII commands to that port number. Also you can read characters from that port, when waiting of a Motion Controller answer. If your programming language doesnt support the RS232 port, youve to get a RS232 function library from an other manufacturer. In the internet youll find a lot of shareware tools for each programming language. CC programmers can also use the functions of the Windows API See the windows API reference The following example uses the BuildCommDCB and SetCommState functions of the windows API to set up COM1 to operate at 9600 baud, with no parity, 8 data bits, and 1 stop bitp  precodeidComDev  OpenCommCOM1 , 1 024, 1 28 if idComDev lt 0  ShowErroridComDev, OpenComm return 0 e rr  BuildCommDCBCOM1 9600,n,8,1 , ampdcb if err lt 0  ShowErrorerr, BuildCommDCB return 0 e rr  SetCommStateampdcb if err lt 0  ProgExamples.doc 2  2 ShowErrorerr, SetCommState return 0  Example of writing an ASCII command to the opened RS232 port char command[1 0] strcpycommand,V1 00r WriteCommidComDev, ampcommand, 1  codepre  pI need to do that in VS, and i was trying to implement this code, but it doesnt work. p  pThere many errors like this.    14  IntelliSense identifier OpenComm is undefined    p  pThe full code is herep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltWindows.hgt include ltiostreamgt  void main       int idComDev  OpenCommCOM22 , 1 024, 1 28     if idComDev lt 0          ShowErroridComDev, OpenComm         return 0           int err  BuildCommDCBCOM22 9600,n,8,1 , ampdcb     if err lt 0          ShowErrorerr, BuildCommDCB         return 0       err  SetCommStateampdcb if err lt 0      ShowErrorerr, SetCommState return 0   Example of writing an ASCII command to the opened RS232 port char command[10] strcpycommand,V100r WriteCommidComDev, ampcommand, 1 codepre  pp

Negative 355 pI have tried to see if I can do this on AndroidPlot, HelloCharts and MPAndroidChart. I have a Weight Management App and want to show a chart of how weight has changed over time.  p  pIve just started looking at this and am falling at the first hurdle of plotting irregular intervals on the X axis.  All of the examples for all of these seem to show linear plotting with every interval on the X axis having a value plotted.   p  pBut my users might weigh themselves everyday for a week and then wait a month before the next weight so there should be a linear date scale and weights mapped against it but with many days not having a value to plot.p  pAm i missing something obvious or is this something that these libraries just dont do and I will have to look at building it from scratch  p

Negative 355 pOften I have to program microcontrollers in C, because C compilers are often not available, or can not make extremely small code because of various bugs.  But often, OOP syntactic sugar, is very convenient when it comes to making programs for hardware more clearly encapsulated for easy maintenance so I wanted to find out if there was a way to do OOP syntax in C where as much as possible the OOP overhead when not needed could be made to optimize out in a way that is portable. eg That will optimize with gcc targeted for different microcontrollers, or perhaps by using gccs preprocessor and a generic ANSIC compiler if gcc is not available for that microcontroller.p  pI found only threads, like this, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10266559elegantwaytoemulatethispointerwhendoingoopincElegant way to emulate 39this39 pointer when doing OOP in Ca which generally do OOP by embedding pointers into structs but thats not always what I want because it wastes memory when Im not interested in virtual methods, or anything like that.  I can always follow the coding style in the link where those features are needed, but I want to develop techniques for when they are not needed e.g. I just want to be able to program using OOP paradigms, with simple easy to understand code Not necessarily C, though I like C, and still be able to achieve a minimal C program memory usage when some OOP paradigms are not in use.p  pSo, I resorted to experimentation with gcc, and C99, because in general gcc 3.2 or above is available for most platforms and realized that I could use the sizeof and typeof compiler functions from C99 to index classes automatically  a trick of sorts  from an unuseduninitialized union member So classes must be unions with substructs, in order to access a compile time constant lookup table created by macros, which could bind data and methods, and guarantee all type checking. etc. etc. etc.p  peg GCC allows the optimizing out of const structures, and arrays, when their members are only accessed as constant expressions, so I thought I might be able to use that to build a macro based compile time binding system where the OOP overhead is handled in GCC and actually optimizes out of the final binary.p  pWith this system, I can now do variadic macro method calls, like  M a , init, with, any, parameters, 7  which looks up variable as type, call method init, using variable number of parameters... p  pSee code examples below, and try them out  its simpler than the explanation  Use gcc E to see the macro expansions, and note for ANSI only compilers, the typeof operator will have to be replaced by a voidtypecast type checking only works with GCC.p  pThe code is cut and pasteable into a text editor, with filename on first line, and it does compile and run on normal PC systems.p  pAlthough I did succeed in getting rid of individual pointers in every struct to point back to a classs list of methods, which saves memory in a limited memory microcontroller, I wasnt quite able to figure out how to get the compiler to optimize out emunusedem method pointers because I had to use void pointers for the classes to hold them in an array, and those require a memory address address of a struct and a linker instance and dont optimize out.p  pSo I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to improve my solution by making some kind of an eminitializedem method struct which would optimize out have no linker address after compilation, eg when its members are only accessed as constant expressions in the code.   In essence Im needing to be able to look up an element in array where the initialized portion of each array element is a different classXXXmt, rather than a list of addresses to classXXXmt all typecast to void.p  pTheres two other improvements Id like help with if anyone can think of a simple solution  The cpp cpreprocessor doesnt allow defining of new macros from within a previous macro by token concatenation As far as I know, so I have to make fixed length macro lists A maximum of 10 in my example to hold class definitions which means I can only have a maximum of 10 classes in a program but ideally, I would like a way to make my code more generic, so that the cpp could create variable length lists on the fly.  eg The problem is related the inability of the c preprocessor to count automatically.p  pAnd secondly, when I try to use anonymous structs for newer versions of GCC, so I might get rid of an extra m required to access member data in ISOC eg foo.m.mydata, by deleting the m name from the class union definition, and compile with gcc stdc11  , it then simply gave me errors claiming the struct defined nothing... so, anonymous structs inside unions dont work even in GCC 4.8 although it supposed to  how can I get anonymous structs to workp  pBelow is the example of how I tested and implemented an include file, voidbind.h, which builds a list of classes and statically links the methods to the variables of that class type.p  pUltimately, the system allows me to program like this example which I compiled with gcc 4.0 to 4.9 with no problemsp  precodeclasstest.c ifndef MACROCHECK   Dont macro expand stdio.h, its ugly... include ltstdio.hgt   to see macros, do gcc D MACROCHECK E classtest.c endif include class1.h  include example class, library.  define VOIDFINALIZE include voidbind.h  Make class list finalized, no more classes allowed  void main void       class1ct a  types ending in ct are the macro created class types     class2ct b      M a , init   Call method of variable, a, and the function init.     printfas sn,a.m.name, M b, tryme, echo is this         Id love to be rid of .m. in the previous line using anonymous struct  codepre  pNext is the Class definition  header file, for both class1 and class2, showing how the macro preprocessor is used to create classes of data bound to methods and the ct type normally this would probably be broken up into two header files, and two libraries but Im just abusing the header by putting all the code together for simplicity.p  precodeclass1.h ifndef class1h define class1h    Define the data type structure for class1 typedef struct      char name     int   one  class1t   Define the method type structure for class1  union class1ctt   class type tag, incomplete tag type for class1ct typedef struct   method prototypes     void init union class1ctt   passed a pointer to class1ct  class1mt   bind class1mt and class1t together into class1ct define VOIDNEWCLASS class1 include voidbind.h   Begin class2 definition typedef struct   define data type for class2     int x  class2t  union class2ctt   class type tag, forward definition typedef struct   method prototypes for class2     char tryme union class2ctt, char echo   class2mt   bind class2t and class2mt together into class2ct define VOIDNEWCLASS class2 include voidbind.h    Start library code  This would normally be a separate file, and linked in  but as were doing a test, this is in the header instead...  include ltclass1.hgt  void class1init class1ct self       selfgtm.name  test     selfgtm.one5      Define class1s method type mt instance of linker data ld  voidbind.h when it creates classes, expects an instance of the  method type mt named with mtld appended to link the prototyped  methods to C functions.  This is the actual binding information  and is the data that I cant get to optimize out, eg when there  is more than one method, and some of them are not used by the program  class1mt class1mtld       .initclass1init     CLASS2 libcode   char class2tryme class2ct self, char echo       return echo    class2s method type mt instance of linker data ld. class2mt class2mtld    linker information for method addresses     .trymeclass2tryme     End of library code  endif codepre  pFinally, comes voidbind.h This is the heart of the system, Getting the CPP to make a compile time constant list of void pointers to method structs ... the void list will always optimize out, as long as everything passed in are compile time constants. But the structs in the list will not completely optimize out.  even if constants. p  pFor this to idea to work, I had to figure out a way to make cpp count how many times the voidbind header file was included, in order to automatically make a list of class pointers, and since the macro preprocessor can not do addition, or define macros which change based on a previous definition of the same macro name I had to use inline functions to save the pointer to the class method struct mt from one pass to the next.  Thats what forces me to basically use void pointers, though it might be solvable in another way.p  precode voidbind.h  A way to build compile time void pointer arrays  These arrays are lists of constants that are only important at compile  time and which go away once the compilation is finished egstatic bind.

Negative 355 pI am in the middle of converting an old Access 2003 app into a web app for an internal project and one of the most prevalent UI elements are codeselectcodes with several hundred elements within them.

But in each row, this same codeselectcode is repeated each time. p  pIm worrying about repeating this pattern firstly, because its ugly because of the effects it might have on the browsers performance and, above all, because of the lag it might introduce into the UX.

Negative 355 pI have a two column layout, where in first column there is always one item per row and in second column there are any number of items. The problem in my example is that the sizes differ and float only works, if the first column item is higher than the ones in second column. I know best would be to wrap the items of the right column into one container, but I cannot change the structure of the HTML, I only can do some CSS andor JavaScript including JQuery. But I would prefer a CSS only solution. I also cannot set the height of the first column items statically, because the amount and height of the right column items is dynamic.p  pThe expected result img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comKC7IV.png altenter image description herep  pSee JSFiddle for my current approach a hrefhttpsfiddle.jshell.netuqh9uz5o relnofollowhttpsfiddle.jshell.netuqh9uz5oap  pThanks, Ingop

Negative 355 pIve got Cloudfront set up in front of two applications one is RailsAngular, and the other is pure Angular.  The root page of the site is the RailsAngular app, and contains a link to codefoocode.  Cloudfront catches codefoocode and allows the Angular app to handle it.  The Angular app uses codeuiroutercode, and has codehtml5Modecode enabled.p  pThe problem is that IE9 doesnt support html5 routing, and handles that with a hashbanged URL codefoocode.  When I click on a link to codefoocode in IE9, I see this the URL changes to codefoocode and the proper codeuiviewcode for codefoocode is rendered, strongbut only for about a secondstrong.  After that, the strongrootstrong page the RailsAngular app appears to be rendered.  But, interestingly, when I view the page source, it shows the correct HTML for codefoocode as determined by the Angular app.  The URL is still codefoocode.p  pFrankly, Im not even sure where the problem arises.  Cloudfront gets the request to codefoocode and loads the Angular app, but why then does the root page appear to be rendered  Does Cloudfront need to handle codefoocode somehowp

I found a a hrefhttpsconnect.microsoft.comVisualStudiofeedbackdetails808357accessviolationduetostackmisalignmentrespwrongssecodegenerated relnofollowbug reporta that is similar to my problem.pli lipMy game uses XNAMath, specifically XMMATRIX and XMVECTOR. Normally this would require that I align everything. However, because I didnt want to run into problems like this, I am compiling with the XMNOINTRINSICS flag which is supposed to turn off XNAMaths use of SIMD instructions. That has never seemed to be an issue until now. The specific crash that I am dealing with is with my own vector type, but it is in close enough proximity to XMMATRIX code that I believe that its all mixed together by optimizations.pli lipMy game is built as a Win32 application. Is switching to x64 a viable solution to this or would that be ridiculous overkill I dont know what consequences that would have besides needing to get 64bit versions of libraries I use.pli ul

Negative 355 pIve been reading the book Head First Python where the writer talks about creating dynamic webpages using a module he created called yate, an HTML template engine which I renamed to siteyate in the code below. The example he works through is a hypothetical coach wanting his athletes to be able to check their times online. The design is as follows first you enter the homepage which has a link to run a script which generates a webpage where you can select the athlete whose times you want to view. Then when you select your athlete and click submit the form calls another script called sitegeneratetimingdata.py where you can views the athletes top times. So I decided to take it further and add functionality to add a time for the athlete, using this extra line of code in my python script.p  precodeprintsiteyate.doformaddtime.py, [athleteid] codepre  pThe HTML this will generate will be thisp  precodeltform actionaddtime.py methodPOSTgt lth1gtWant to add a timelth1gt ltinput typeText name1 size40gt 1 is the athletes id in this example ltinput typeSubmit valueSubmitgt ltformgt codepre  pAs you can see this code calls the script addtime.py which has the following codep  precodeimport cgi import sqlite3  data  cgi.FieldStorage.value[0] this attribute will be in the form MininFieldStoragename, value id  data.name this attribute is the inputs name i.e. athletes id time  data.value this attribute is the inputs value i.e. the time  connection  sqlite3.connectNUACDB.sqlite my DBs name cursor  connection.cursor cursor.executeINSERT INTO timingdata athleteid, time                  VALUES , ,                 id, time just SQL stuff connection.commit connection.close codepre  pWhich works fine, however I want to change a few thing about this, since it leaves the user on a blank page. I could generate some HTML code to provide links to the homepage etc. or even JavaScript code to redirect the user automatically, but I want to keep this script HTMLfree so that I can also use it elsewhere.p  pWhat I want to do instead is make the script execute on the same page. Not only that, but I would also prefer if I could put the addtime.py code as a function in another module called athletemodel.py and call it form there, i.e. codeathletemodel.addtimecode or I could do codefrom athletemodel import addtimecode so I can call the function directly. How can I call a python function using HTML code Im aware of the codeonsubmitcode form attribute but apparently that is for JavaScript functions. Another thing Im unsure about is whether the data submitted in the form will still be accessible through CGI FieldStorage and hence whether my addtime.py code will still work as it is.p  pThis stuff is so confusing All help is appreciated.p

Negative 355 pGiven a RichFaces datatable, with each row bound to an onclick event firing an ajax request to render a frame on the same page, is it possible to prevent the sending of similar requests p  pBy similar, I mean that the user is clicking fast on every row of the table. This induces several possibly costly requests to be sent to the backend while only the last one is sufficient to render what I want correctly.p  pI thought that Richfaces Queues were providing that feature but I cant make it work.

This seems to relate to installer Error 1608.p  pIt happens on both my development machine, but also another clear test machine I tried it on.p  pI did copy the code from the singleuser project, but then changed the relevant names and locations and inserted a new upgradecode or in one case, copied it from an old installer like I did for the singleuser version.p  pIts true that there currently is no installed version on my machine to upgrade to, but I understood that its not required, even though an upgradecode and a majorupgrade tag are there.

The problem is that codeItemReadercode is not thread safe. p  blockquote   pThere are some practical limitations of using multithreaded Steps for some common Batch use cases. Many participants in a Step e.g. readers and writers are stateful, and if the state is not segregated by thread, then those components are not usable in a multithreaded Step. In particular most of the offtheshelf readers and writers from Spring Batch are not designed for multithreaded use. It is, however, possible to work with stateless or thread safe readers and writers, and there is a sample parallelJob in the Spring Batch Samples that show the use of a process indicator see a hrefhttpdocs.spring.iospringbatchreferencehtmlreadersAndWriters.htmlprocessindicator relnofollowSection 6.12, Preventing State Persistencea to keep track of items that have been processed in a database input table.p blockquote  pIm considered on parallelJob sample on spring batch github repository  a hrefhttpsgithub.comspringprojectsspringbatchblobmasterspringbatchsamplessrcmainjavaorgspringframeworkbatchsamplecommonStagingItemReader.java relnofollowhttpsgithub.comspringprojectsspringbatchblobmasterspringbatchsamplessrcmainjavaorgspringframeworkbatchsamplecommonStagingItemReader.javaap  pIm a bit confused about Process indicator pattern.

Negative 355 pIm trying to add a header to all http requests sent by angular resource used to access a REST server, to add Basic Auth information from the user input usernamepassword.p  pI thought it was as simple as codehttp.defaults.headers.common[Authorization]  valuecode where value is the correctly formatted auth info when the user hits the login button, but when the requests are sent a 403 Unauthorized is returned, and inspecting the requests in Chromes network tab the header is not set on a simple resource query.p  pI have been searching for a while now, there are several questions referring to this that suggest CORS is the problem it is not, I have the correct headers set on the server side and have also tried running with web safety off in chrome just to double check that this wasnt interfering. Other answers suggest using an interceptor, but that seems to me to be very overengineered for such a simple task although if it is the only way I guess Ill have to use it.p  pEDIT Additional information I am convinced CORS is not the issue, as requests to the same server that do not require authentication succeed and return the expected responses. This is a problem with the Authorization header not being set correctly or at all.p

Negative 355 pI am using a hrefhttpapi.jqueryui.comdroppable relnofollowjQuery Droppablea and want to save the coordinates in percentage value.

The following is a list of commands that followedp  precodegit fetch origin refsheadsrefsremotesorigin git push mirror git push all codepre  pWhat followed next was nothing short of a nightmare. Any branch on the remote that wasnt checked out on my local machine was deleted on the repository.

Ive done codegit reflog showcode but that only shows logs on the current branch codeHEADcode. Doing codegit fsckcode shows 6 dangling commits and 2 dangling blobs. Prior to doing codegit push mirrorcode the branch had 16 branches, 5 of which were created by our organization and the rest were from the original fork.

If i do it, the whole layout is vertically expanded.p  precodeltRelativeLayout xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid xmlnstoolshttpschemas.android.comtools androidlayoutwidthmatchparent androidlayoutheightmatchparent androidbackground00ffffff androidorientationvertical toolscontextcom.rabiya.menu.MainActivity androidididrl01 gt     ltRelativeLayout   androidididrl02   androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent   androidlayoutheightwrapcontent   androidlayoutalignParentBottomtrue   androidlayoutalignParentLefttrue   androidlayoutalignParentStarttrue   androidlayoutmarginBottom15dp   androidbackgrounddrawablebackground3 gt     ltImageButton       androidididexit3       androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent       androidlayoutheightwrapcontent       androidlayoutalignParentRighttrue       androidlayoutalignParentEndtrue        androidcontentDescriptionstringimage       androidlayoutalignParentToptrue       androidbackgrounddrawableexit        gt     ltTextView            androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent   androidlayoutheightwrapcontent   androidididtv01   androidbackground000   androidlayoutcenterHorizontaltruegt    ltLinearLayout    androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent   androidlayoutheightwrapcontent   androidididrl03   androidbackground00ffffff   androidlayoutbelowidtv01   androidorientationvertical    gt           ltImageButton            androidididbutton1            androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent            androidlayoutheightwrapcontent            androidbackgrounddrawableclick            androidcontentDescriptionstringimage            androidpaddingTop20dip gt       ltImageButton      androidididbutton2      androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent      androidlayoutheightwrapcontent      androidbackgrounddrawableclick      androidcontentDescriptionstringimage       gt        ltImageButton      androidididbutton3      androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent      androidlayoutheightwrapcontent       androidbackgrounddrawableclick      androidcontentDescriptionstringimage       gt        ltImageButton      androidididbutton4      androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent      androidlayoutheightwrapcontent       androidbackgrounddrawableclick      androidcontentDescriptionstringimage       gt     ltLinearLayoutgt    ltRelativeLayoutgt   ltRelativeLayoutgt codepre

Negative 355 pIve scoured Stack Overflow and the interwebs to no avail, so I thought I would create my first question.p  pThe problem is this With previous versions of Android Studio I could choose the targetedSDKVersion and compliedSDKVersion when creating the project, the latest stable version on my Mac v1.3.2 doesnt allow this.p  pInstead, it defaults to using the most recently installed version. Even if I change the build.gradle settings to an older sdk, it has problems with finding some elements and styles, which makes sense for different sdk versions.p  pSo my question is strongHow can I create a new Android Studio project with an older compiledSDKVersionstrongp  pMy ultimate purpose is to have an Android Studio project that I and a couple of others can work on from multiple computers. Well be using Git but I prefer not to use the builtin VCS features, I just dont want to add new confusing concepts to something that should be simple.p  pThanks for any assistance, Ill do what I can to clarify if requested.p
