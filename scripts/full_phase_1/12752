Positive 12752 pstrongtldrstrong We created a firefox addon using the Addon SDK. Since compiling the addon is one step in a larger build system we also compile for chrome, our build system packages the xpi manually and does not use jpm. However, we used the contents of a jpm packaged addon as a template for writing our own addon. This only works for firefox 38. Is there an easy way to make it work for earlier versionsp  pstrongDetailsstrongp  pSo we package an xpi file that contains the following bootstrap.jsp  precode This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public   License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this   file, You can obtain one at httpmozilla.orgMPL2.0.  use strict  const  utils Cu   Components const rootURI  SCRIPTURISPEC.replacebootstrap.js,  const COMMONJSURI  resourcegremodulescommonjs const  require   Cu.importCOMMONJSURI  toolkitrequire.js,  const  Bootstrap   requireCOMMONJSURI  sdkaddonbootstrap.js const  startup, shutdown, install, uninstall   new BootstraprootURI codepre  pFurthermore, the xpi contains an index.js with the actual code. This index.js is then setting up content scripts for sdkpagemod.p  pSo in the bootstrap.js, the startupshutdown functions are linked to a Bootstrap object, which then handles enablingdisabling of the plugin.p  pThis works fine in firefox 40, but I tested it with versions before 38 and it doesnt work, because it cant run the bootstrap.js script.p  pIs there a simple way to get it working for earlier firefox versions ItS unfortunately quite hard to find documentation on this. Specificially, we dont want to break enablingdisabling the addon, i.e. if a user disables the addon, then the pagemod should be disabled too as the Bootstrap class does it, and when enabling the plugin, it should be enabled again.p

Positive 12752 pIve created an addon that loads jQuery as a content script. This is to ensure that other content scripts that rely on jQuery can make use of it.p  pWhen running on OSX the extension works as expected and jQuery is loaded in when the extension is started.

I was thinking a regex replace on each of the tokens on right and if a replace didnt occur because there was not match just append it. But maybe there is better way.p  pCheers Anthonyp  pEdit The right side should override the left. The left being what was originally there and the right side being the new content. Another way of looking at it, is that you only keep the tokens on the left if they dont exist on the right and you keep all the tokens on the right. p  pstrongFerdinandstrong Thanks for the reply. The problem is the efficiency with which the solution you proposed. I was initially thinking down similar lines but discounted it due to the Onz complexity of the merge where n and z is the number tokens on the left and right respectively let alone the splitting and joining. p  pHence why I was trying to look down the path of a regex. Maybe behind the scenes, regex is just as bad or worse, but having a regex which removes any token from the left string that exists on the right On for the total amount of token on the right and then just add the 2 string together i.e. vat test  test1  test2 seems more efficient. thanks p

Negative 12752 pIm using the .NET 3.0 class codeSystem.Security.Cryptography.MACTripleDEScode class to generate a MAC value.

Negative 12752 pI have an interesting Active Record problem and Im not quite sure what the cleanest solution is. The legacy database that I am integrating with has a strange wrinkle in its schema where one logical table has been partitioned into several physical tables. Each table has the same structure, but contains data about different items.p  pIm not great at explaining this clearly as you can tell. Let me try and explain with a concrete example. Lets say we have a Car, which has one or more Wheels. Normally wed represent that with a Car table and a Wheels table like sop  precodeCREATE TABLE cars    id int11 NOT NULL autoincrement,   name varchar255,   etc   CREATE TABLE wheels    id int11 NOT NULL autoincrement,   carid int11 NOT NULL,   color varchar255,   etc  codepre  pSo far, so good. But with the partioning strategy that is in my legacy database it would look more likep  precodeCREATE TABLE cars    id int11 NOT NULL autoincrement,   name varchar255,   etc   CREATE TABLE cartowheeltablemap    carid int11 NOT NULL,   wheeltable varchar255   CREATE TABLE wheelsforfords    id int11 NOT NULL autoincrement,   carid int11 NOT NULL,   color varchar255   CREATE TABLE wheelsforbuicks    id int11 NOT NULL autoincrement,   carid int11 NOT NULL,   color varchar255   CREATE TABLE wheelsfortoyotas    id int11 NOT NULL autoincrement,   carid int11 NOT NULL,   color varchar255  codepre  pSo here we have a set of wheelsforx tables, and a cartowheeltablemap table which contains a mapping from carid to the specific wheelsforx which contains the wheels for a specific car. If I want to find the set of wheels for a car I first have to find out which wheels table to use via the cartowheeltablemap table, and then look up records in the wheel table specified in the cartowheeltablemap.p  pFirstly, can someone enlighten me as to if there is a standard name for this techniquep  pSecondly, does anyone have any pointers on how I can make this work in Active Record in a nice clean way. The way I see it I can either have a Wheel model where the table name can be defined per instance, or I can dynamically create Model classes at runtime with the correct table name as specified in the mapping table.p  pstrongEDITstrong Note that changing the schema to be closer to what AR wants is not an option. Various legacy codebases rely on this schema and cannot realistically be modified.p

Negative 12752 pI would like to match patterns on strings like on the following ant documentation. Is there a gem already for this or is this an easy task with regexpsp  phr p  pI know Dir.glob already does this but I dont know how to use it without a real filesystem.p  phr p  precode matches zero or more characters,  matches one character.  In general, patterns are considered relative paths, relative to a task dependent base directory the dir attribute in the case of ltfilesetgt. Only files found below that base directory are considered. So while a pattern like ..foo.java is possible, it will not match anything when applied since the base directorys parent is never scanned for files.  Examples  .java  matches  .java, x.java and FooBar.java, but not FooBar.xml does not end with .java.  .java  matches  x.java, A.java, but not .java or xyz.java both dont have one character before .java.  Combinations of s and s are allowed.  Matching is done perdirectory. This means that first the first directory in the pattern is matched against the first directory in the path to match. Then the second directory is matched, and so on. For example, when we have the pattern abc.java and the path xabcfoobartest.java, the first abc is matched with xabc, then  is matched with foobar, and finally .java is matched with test.java. They all match, so the path matches the pattern.  To make things a bit more flexible, we add one extra feature, which makes it possible to match multiple directory levels. This can be used to match a complete directory tree, or a file anywhere in the directory tree. To do this,  must be used as the name of a directory. When  is used as the name of a directory in the pattern, it matches zero or more directories. For example test matches all filesdirectories under test, such as testx.java, or testfoobarxyz.html, but not xyz.xml.  There is one shorthand if a pattern ends with  or , then  is appended. For example, mypackagetest is interpreted as if it were mypackagetest.  Example patterns CVS    Matches all files in CVS directories that can be located anywhere in the directory tree.

Negative 12752 pIve managed to program the following THWorkingMemory class, into a antipattern, the God Object. I planned it to be a fairly small class with around 20 methods, but now its packed with queue handlers, timers, threads, callbacks, powershell queue callbacks, event handlers, lock handlers and about 50 methods, i.e. the lot.  The class has grown far too big to be maintainable, and I need to split into smaller classes. But how to do it p  pThe THWorkingMemory class fundamentally defines around 8 main code blocks, which would suggest 8 seperate classes, but all the methods which write to the TreeDictionary use the ReaderWriterLockerWrapper. p  pHere is the code. p  precodeinterface IWorkingMemory  protected CMemory CBase protected CMemory CCM  get  ..   public abtract event .. public abstract void ExecuteActionGuid ExecutionGuid, string jim ... ... .. ..20 methods, events   internal sealed class CMemory      public CMemory          CBasenew TreeDictionaryltGuid, ExecutionStategtnew comparer     ..    public sealed class ExecutionState    20 methods. that act against the treedictionary node    internal sealed class THWorkingMemoryIWorkingMemory         lockStrategy  new ReaderWriterLockerWrapper      public void ExecuteActionGuid ExecutionGuid, string jim ... ...           lockStrategy.AcquireWriteLock     CCM[ExecutionGuid].CreateExecutionStatejim     lockStrategy.ReleaseWriteLock           2000 lines of methods, timers, threading, events, callbacks,          queues processing. powershell script callbacks from ExecutionState, etc.   private ReaderWriterLockerWrapper      public void AcquireWriteLockint timeout n     public void ReleaseWriteLock   codepre  pI had a look at the questions regarding partial classes, but they dont get a good writeup.  It would make sense here, as the ReaderWriterLockerWrapper is used by most methods in the THWorkingMemory class. p  pWhats the best way of splitting the THWorkingMemory, so it preserves the veracity of the lock class, i.e. ensures that writes into the tree dictionary dont conflict, that is writes are locked. I also looked at nested classes, which would work as a solution, but not be able to use the locker in the same manner it is now. p  pAny ideasp
Negative 12752 pIm using a suite of WatiN tests driving IE to do some periodic sanity checking for the purposes of monitoring a site.p  pThe suite works fine when I invoke it interactively andor when I configure the task in Task Scheduler to Run only when the user is logged on.p  pHowever, when I set it to Run whether the user is logged on or not, and check the Run with highest privileges option WatiN cant talk to the browser satisfactorily under Windows Server 2008 and many other OSes without having admin privileges, WatiN cant communicate with its iexplore.exe instances satisfactorily they start, but I get a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions750600watincompatibilitywithwindows14969251496925timeout exception as detailed in this posta. I have added the site Im hitting to the Trusted sites for both admin and nonadmin contexts of IE. Ive tried with and without elevation, with and without disabling ESC and with and with and without turning off Protected Mode for the internet zone. As my nonGUI tests are happy, I assume its a limitation of the type of interactivity thats possible in the context of a noninteractive Scheduled Task, even when Run with highest privileges.p  pRight now, my temporary workaround is to require a [TS] session to remain open at all times, ready to run the scheduled task.p  pIf I was to persist with this, Id at a minimum add a heartbeat notification to allow something to monitor that the task is actually getting to run [e.g., if someone logs the session off or reboots the box].p  pHowever, Im looking for something more permanent  something that is capable of regularly invoking my WatiN tests [run using xunitconsole.x86.exe v 1.5] on my Windows Server 2008 [x64] box, just like Task Scheduler but with a proper Interactive session.p  pId prefer not to use psexec or remcom if possible, and cant see how creating a Windows Service would do anything other than add another point of failure but Id be interested to hear of all proven solutions out there.p

Negative 12752 pWould I violate the HIG by showing a tab bar on my first view only The first view also has a tableview and navigation bar at the top.  Once the user selects a row, it goes to another tableview and no tab bar.  The navigation bar is still at the top and the user can go back.  Clicking a row from here displays the detail view.  In summary, the tab bar will only be available on the first view.p  p EDIT p  pTechnically, I know how to do this.  But from the HIG and user point of views, Im not sure about it.  The tab bar is only needed on the first view to reach the in app purchase store.  Guess this really constitutes a redesign where I have a new button on the first view  My navigation bar has just enough room for it in the top right.  p
Negative 12752 pSo Im working on a frameworkesque system with one of my coworkers. Our current challenge is how to best implement statuses. Oftentimes, a status will carry with it unique data a color for a table row, or text to be displayed to a user. etc. Currently, we have a statuses table which contains all this data. Contained in that table is a column cssclass, which, whenever a record has that status, the specified CSS class is attached to the element in this case a tr. Also, in order to assign another record a specific status, a foreign key is specified in that database table in this case, a user has a specific status. So in the users table, there is a statusesid foreign key. This implementation works alright, but there are a few problems. First, what if I need to perform a specific action in PHP if a record is in a specific status The way we do it now is something like thisp  precodeifusergtstatus0       execute some code  codepre  pThis really doesnt work well if statuses can change. Change one status, and the associated code either breaks or behaves differently than intended.p  pThe other issue, and the main reason for posting a question is that the table contains the column cssclass. This is very versatile and allows us change the style of a specific status very quickly. But we really dislike the idea of putting code inside a database. Perhaps having CSS classes in a database isnt necessarily a bad thing, but I really dont know what the common practice is. Any ideasp  pEDITp  pWhat Ive gathered from the first few answers is that I should keep all my view stuff out of my model stuff in order to maintain an MVC framework. My argument is that if I keep the cssclass name out of the database, then Im checking the status id in the view in order to decide which class to assign it. So if I put the class in the database, Im putting View information in the Model. If I dont put CSS classes in the database then Im putting Model information in the View checking which ID it belongs to. So by not muddying up the Model, I muddy up the view instead.......p

Negative 12752 pIm developing a 2D overhead shooter game using C and XNA. I have a class that Ill call bullet and need to update many of these instances every fraction of a second.p  pMy first way to do this was to have a generic List of bullets and simply remove and add new bullets as needed.

Alot of code cut out, but just wanted to show a simple snippetp  precodeif triggerButton      bullets.Addnew bullet  if bulletDestroyed      bullets.Removebullet  codepre  pMy second and current attempt is to have a separate generic Stack of bullets that I push to when Im done with a bullet, and pop off a bullet when I need a new one if theres anything in the stack. If theres nothing in the stack then I add a new bullet to the list. It emseemsem to cut the jerky lag but then again, sometimes theres still some jerky lag springing up though I dont know if its related.p  precodeif triggerButton      if bulletStack.Count gt 0              bullet temp  bulletStack.Pop         temp.resetPosition         bullets.Addtemp          else              bullets.Addnew bullet       if bulletDestroyed      bulletStack.Pushbullet     bullets.Removebullet  codepre  pSo, I know premature optimization is the root of all evil, but this was very noticeable inefficiency that I could catch early and this was before even having to worry about enemy bullets filling the screen. So my questions are Will pushing unused objects to a stack invoke the garbage collection Will the references by kept alive or are objects still being destroyed Is there a better way to handle updating many different objects For instance, am I getting too fancy Would it be fine to just iterate through the list and find an unused bullet that wayp

Negative 12752 pWhat I need to do is running a Java application which is a RESTful service server side writtern by Restlet. And this service will be called by another app running on Google App Engine.p  pBecause of the restriction of GAE, every http call is limited to port 80 and 443 http and https with HttpUrlConnection class. As a result, I have to deploy my server side application on port 80 or 443.p  pHowever, because the app is running on Ubuntu, and those ports under 1024 cannot be accessed by nonroot user, then a Access Denied exception will be thrown when I run my app.p  pThe solutions that have come into my mind includesp  ol lipChanging the security policy of JRE, which is the files resides in libsecurityjava.policy, to grantjava.net.SocketPermission .80 listen, connect, accept, resolve permissionHowever, neither using command line to include this file or overrides the content in JREs java.policy file, the same exception keeps coming out.pli liptry to login as a root user, however because my unfamiliarity with Unix, I dont know how to do it.pli lipanother solution I havent try is to map all calls to 80 to a higher port like 1234, then I can deploy my app on 1234 without problem, and GAE call send request to port 80. But how to connect the missing gap is still a problem.pli ol  pCurrently I am using a hacking method, which is to package the application into a jar file, and sudo running the jar file with root privilege. It works now, but definitely not appropriate in the real deployment environment. p  pSo if anyone have any idea about the solution, thanks very muchp
Negative 12752 pIm a little confused on the varying definitions and implementations of web services available as implementations. Need some clarification please.p  pstrongOnes I have used till nowstrongp  ol lipIf a vendor gives me a specific format of XML that I can send populated with data to request and I make a simple HTTP POST over the internet passing in the XML String as the payload, is this a web service call  If so, is there a specific name to it, this kind of web service  Because obviously, it does not use anything like Axis, WSDL or SOAP to establish this connection. pli lipA variant of this is If the vendor gives me an XSD, I use JAXB to make a java class out of it and pass in the serialized version of the object, which eventually works out to be the same as option 1.pli lipRESTful web service Vendor gives me a URL like a hrefhttprestfulserviceproductshttprestfulserviceproductsa and I can make HTTP Requests to the URL and depending on what HTTP verb I use, the appropropriate action is called and the response sent over the wire.pli ol  pstrongOnes I have only read about have a vague idea aboutstrongp  ol lipSOAP. How does this work.. Ive read the W3Schools tutorial and I undertsand that there is a very specific form of XML that is standardized according to W3C standards that we use to pass the same kind of messages as we did in option 1. But how does this work in real life Vendor sends me what Do I generate classes Do I serialize some objects and http post them over to an address Or do the generated objects themselves have connection methods that will do them for mepli lipWhat about WSDL When does a vendor send me WSDL and what do I do with it  I guess I can generate classes from it. If yes, then what do I do with the generated classes pli lipWhen do I need that axis jar to generate classes from something that the vendor sends pli ol  pAs you can see, I have some clear and other mostly vague ideas about the different kinds of web services available. would help if someone ould clarify andor point to more realworld resources.

Negative 12752 pI have a massive amount of input data thats why I use Hadoop and there are multiple tasks that can be solved with various MapReduce steps of which the first mapper needs all the data as input.p  pstrongMy goal Compute these different tasks as fast as possible.strong p  pI currently let them run sequentially each reading in all the data. I assume it will be faster when combining the tasks and executing their similar parts like feeding all data to the mapper only once.p  pI was wondering if and how I can combine these tasks. For every input keyvalue pair the mapper could emit a super key that includes a task id and the task specific key data along with a value. This way reducers would get keyvalue pairs for a task and a taskspecific key and could decide when seeing the superkey which task to perform on the included key and values.p  pIn pseudo codep  precodemapkey, value     emitSuperKeyTask 1, IncludedKey, value     emitSuperKeyTask 2, AnotherIncludedKey, value  reducekey, values    if key.taskid  Task 1       for value in values            do stuff with key.includedkey and value    else        do something else codepre  pThe key could be a codeWritableComparablecode which can include all the necessary information.p  pNote the pseudo code suggests a terrible architecture and it can definitely be done in a smarter way.p  pMy questions arep  ul liIs this a sensible approachli liAre there better alternativesli liDoes it have some terrible drawbackli liWould I need a custom codePartitionercode class for this approachli ul  pstrongContextstrong The data consists of some millions of RDF quadruples and the tasks are to calculate clusters, statistics and similarities. Some tasks can be solved easily with just Hadoop Counters in a reducer, but some need multiple MapReduce steps.p  pThe computation will eventually take place on Amazons Elastic MapReduce. All tasks are to be computed on the whole dataset and as fast as possible.p

Negative 12752 pIve been creating a checklist webapp using JQuery, and so far it has been going pretty smooth, but now Im trying to make editable content.

Negative 12752 pDisclaimer Im not very familiar with any of the things mentioned in the question title.p  pWould it be possible to use a browser control like Webkit as a frontend for a WSGI app using a framework like Flask without starting a local WSGI serverp  pBasically the requests and responses are managed by a middle layer between the HTML UI and the WSGI backend. A certain URI could mean Local, for instance local or something similar, and will be routed to the embedded WSGI app with all the original headers etc.p  pYou will lose any features that a normal WSGI server provides unless you implement it yourself or somehow embed a server that is also usable via an API instead of real HTTP requests.p  pNow that I think of it, this is the only real requirement strongA WSGI server that is callable via an API and not just real HTTP requests.strongp  pI know the usefulness of this is questionable and maybe doesnt even make sense.

Negative 12752 pIve been trying to build a web site and I was using a codeCSS Reset Stylesheetcode to aid in crossbrowser compatability. However, now that I am looking at the results in Firebug, it looks like all codeCSS Resetscode do is spend a lot of wasted time traversing up the codeDOMcode. For instance, a simple line of code likep  precodeltdivgtltspangtltpgt...ltpgtltspangtltdivgt codepre  pWill inherit a bunch of wasted styles from codep, span, div, body, and htmlcode which will probably be overwritten by a class or id anyways.

Negative 12752 pOkay, so for whatever reason I have ended up with a situation where the key is pointing the wrong way in a onetomany.  It was obviously never used as a onetomany, only as a onetoone, and now there is a need to expand one of those to be many, and the way the key was stored this turned out to be backwards.  p  pThe codeimagescode table has a codetargetidcode, codetargettypecode and codetargetcolumncode, three pieces of information which identify it with any number of content tables.  The codetargettypecode just references the table name of the piece of content that is associated to the image.  codetargetcolumncode is the name of a virtual column not actually in the content table that is used to look up the image.  This enables any arbitrary piece of content to have several associated images, each by a different name.  p  pWhen you have a piece of content and want to find what image is associated to a particular name, you do a p  precodeselect  from images where targetid  content.id      and targettype  content      and targetcolumn  image codepre  pAll of these pieces of information are available when you have a reference to a particular piece of content.p  pWhat I want to do instead is REVERSE all of these, so that the images table knows nothing about the particular pieces of content that reference it, and instead that burden is carried by each of the content tables.  p  pSo far I know I can add a column to the content table and then select the information I need from the images tablep  precodeselect id, targetid from images where targettype  content codepre  pWhat I want to do is use this as a subquery and do a mass update of the content table.  Is something like this possiblep  precodeupdate content set imageid       select id from images where targettype  content as imageids where id      select targetid from images where targettype  content as contentids codepre  pI know this fails, but I want to do some kind of mass assignment of targetids back to imageids.

I represent queens placement as codeint[]code and return codeSetltint[]gtcode using codeHashSetltint[]gtcode as its implementation. codeSetcode is appropriate here since the order of the placements is not important.p  pThe problem is that Java arrays do not override codehashCodecode and different array instances with the same values have the different hash codes. p  pI can write a wrapper class codeQueensPlacementscode, which holds an array and overrides codehashCodecode with codeArrays.deepHashCodecode, and return codeSetltQueensPlacementgtcode.

Negative 12752 pI want my game to be entirely server side. Meaning, the client only sends their keystrokes. They then are given updates of the changed objects positions from the server.

The idea is to avoid the server always correcting our position. We want the client to fill the inbetweens but not try to predict where the server is going to be. p  pWe want to avoid at all costs moving the player in the opposite direction because the client over simulated, so we could multiply the resultant vector by a scalar like 0.98 which would mean the client would be slightly slower than the server and would help ensure a smooth transition to the server position.p  pThanksp

What is happening though is that once a user clicks on delete only the first message hides only the first foreach value but all other messages have separate ids but are not responding to the delete click. I should also note that if I click on delete of any message the first message hides and not the message I clicked on.p  pheres some codep  pViewp  precodeltphp foreach rows as r  gt ltli idnotificationltphp echo r[MID] gtgtltphp echo anchorr[MID], X, arrayclassgtdelete, relgtr[MID] gt ltpgt ltphp echo anchorheadlessviewmsgr[MID], r[head], arrayrelgtnotifications gt ltphp ifstrlenr[body] gt 74  gt ltphp echo r[body] gt  ltphp else  gt ltphp echo substrr[body], 0, 74 . ... gt ltphp endif gt ltpgt ltligt ltphp endforeach gt codepre  pJSp  precode    a.delete.clickfunctioneve      eve.preventDefault      var MID  a.delete.attrrel      .postheadlessnotificationread,          MID MID,      functionhtml         ifparseFloathtml              notification  MID.hideslow             console.logsuccess          else              console.logfail                 codepre  pIm not to sure whats going on here but my guess would be that the javascript is only linking the first foreach and not the restif so how would i fix thisp  pAny help would be appreciated.p  pThanks.p

This is not the case, unless CodeBlocks is recognizing my .h as a Cheader.p  pIn case youre wondering, I am running Lucid Puppy Linux 5.2 aka LuPu, a Ubuntu derivative. Installed CodeBlocks from the Ubuntu repositories p  pIn advance, thank you very much for the help.p

Negative 12752 pBackground  So in terms of approach at the high level there to me seems to bep  ol liSavepersist settings as you proceed through a chain of UINavigationController levels  so when initially starting to change settings, or create settings, there would need to a default set of values  i.e. so at any point of time if the application dies the settings would be validli lisave up changes as you go, and once you come back out of the UINavigationController tree of screens with all settings set there would be a point where you can saveli ol  pThis question is focusing on Option 2 which I was trying to implement.  p  pThe Plan  Whilst in a settings type UINavigationController I was going to pass existing or default details for one section of the settings from the parent view to the child view when the child view gets pushed onto the stack.  The issue is when this data is updated, AND assuming I want to stick with the default Back Button, there does not seem to be a way to intercept the default Back Button, so that when Im ready to pop the child off the stack just before this I will call a delegate which will pass the latest settings back to the parent.  p  pstrongQUESTION  How to pass updated data from a child controller back to the parent controller when using a UINavigationController and wanting to stick with the default Back Button with the left arrow thing on it.strong  p  pThat is, probably I have isnt how to pass the data back I guess Im going to use a delegate, but rather how to hook into a callback method at the right point of time in the child controller so as to then use the delegate method to pass the data back.  p
Negative 12752 pAs far as I know, right now there is no free not even cheap visual designer for making AS3 apps. Its not like it is not possible to create one  just like I can write the GUI definition code in FlashDevelop we could have this hypothetical tool generate it based on drag and drop actions, but at present nobody has built one yet.p  pSo suppose we wanted to build such a tool for AS3 widgets or for some others such buttons and text boxes widget framework. Is there a generic form builder tool that we could customize for this purpose Or would basically the only barely customizable thing on the table be the forms designer component from .net framework It could hypothetically be beaten into representing the AS3 etc framework widgets as user defined controls with us running a separate tool to automatically convert the C form definition code into the target framework language, e.g. into runnable AS3 appsp

You can see a demo of the effect here 2nd demo a hrefhttpflowplayer.orgtoolsdemostabsmultipletabs.htm relnofollowhttpflowplayer.orgtoolsdemostabsmultipletabs.htmap  pI am trying to only show the first series of tabs when you load the page, and then one you click on a tab, it loads as normal.p  pCurrently, I am using jquery to achieve this effect but it is NO WAY ideal. Here is my codep  precodeset the 2nd row of tabs to be invisible display none doesnt work .panefirst.cssopacity,0  remove the class current, so the first tab doesnt show its current css state ul.tabs li a.current.removeClasscurrent  when any tab is clicked ul.tabs a.clickfunction      animate the 2nd row of tabs back to full opacity     .panefirst.animate               opacity1         , 1000      codepre  pPROBLEM ONE I want this to only work on the FIRST time codeul.tabs acode is clicked. After the opacity is at 1, I dont need to run this script every time codeul.tabs acode is clickedp  pPROBLEM TWO Because I am simply setting the opacity to 0, the elements are still loaded into the DOM and take up space. I cannot use displaynone, because the tab js script will ignore it.p  pThis works...but I know this is not the best way to go about this.

Negative 12752 pIm seriously confused on the differences between cacerts and jssecacerts files.p  pI know that by default java looks for the jssecacerts file and then the cacerts file.p  pBut what is the point of the jssecacerts filep  pMy understanding is that if a new truststore needs to be used then a copy of cacerts should be made and all new trusted CAs should be added to that copy.  The copy of cacerts with the new CAs should then be referenced by the Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore system property.  That way other java applications that run on that machine wont accidently trust nondefault CAs.p

Negative 12752 pIve got a question about coding an algorithm for a Texas Instruments TMS320C64xx DSP in MATLABp  pIve got a working sloppy implementation of my filter in MATLAB. My goal is to use MATLAB Embedded Coder to convert this algorithm to C which I can then import to Code Composer Studio and load onto the DSP.p  pTo do this, I know there are certain things I need to do to my MATLAB code. For example, I need to preallocate space for matrices so it knows what size to make them unless I want to fuss around with variable sized data. All that massaging of MATLAB code into Cish code so that MATLAB coder can convert it I more or less understand. However, I have no idea how to make sure that my data types for example the coefficients of my filter are fixed point rather than floating point so that MATLAB Embedded Coder will convert my code to C which only involves fixed point data types.p  pstrongSo I guess my overall questions arestrongp  p1 If the C64xx is specified as a 32bit Fixed Point DSP, that means a compiler for it will throw an error if I try to use the float data typep  p2 Is there a way to ensure that MATLAB Embedded Coder does not create float data typesp  p3 Do I need to use the MATLAB Fixed Point Toolboxp  pThank you all, let me know if there is anymore information necessary to answer my question.p
Negative 12752 pSo Im trying to code out my design for my new portfolio website, but Im having a few issues there that research and hours of smashing my face against the computer screen have not yet solved. There are two big issues right now that Im stuck on, though there is yet another that Im currently considering if I even want to deal with at all. p  pThe first issue is the menu. I want the typeface to go from regular to bold when you hover over it, or when youre on that page. Which works. Problem is when you hover over it, the other two items in the menu adjust slightly because the change in type weight pushes them out. My attempts thus far have all ended with failure.p  pThe second issue is the footer. I want it to stay on the bottom of the page. My research has gotten me this far, but instead of what I wanted, now it actually stays at the bottom of the browser, not at the bottom of the content. Thank you for any help you can givep  pThe page in question can be found at a hrefhttppersonal.justgooddesign.netdraft relnofollowhttppersonal.justgooddesign.netdraftap

Negative 12752 pIn Restlet you have a class called codeSecretVerifiercode with an abstract method codeverifyString identifier, char[] secretcode that you are to override in your subclass. The base class will also create a codeUsercode object initialized with the identifier. So far so good.p  pNow the codeEnrolercode interface needs to be implemented to add roles to the aforementioned codeUsercode object that is passed to the subclass via the codeClientInfocode object. Here is where you add roles to the User object.p  pLets assume that codeChallengeAuthenticatorcode is being used for authentication.p  pemQuestionem Both these classes are quite distinct and you dont have access to the corresponding RequestResponse objects. The very design sort of forces you to perform 2 round trips to the DB  one to verify the password and one to fetch the roles of the user. Is this an efficient designp  pYou can fetch everything in a single query, so to speak. And since both classes will invoke the corresponding DAOs separately, there will be 2 calls to the DB.p  pOf course you can have slightly convoluted code by overriding codeSecretVerifier.getIdentifierRequest req, Response respcode and then use that to fetch everything and add the roles  but the codeverifycode method seems to be a part of the codetemplatecode patter and you cant really control whats happening in the base class, unless you directly implement codeVerifiercode and reinvent the wheel and tweak the code ever so slightly...but the question is about the design decision. I dont want to start a debate. I just want to know is something like this 2 trips one for authentication, the other for roles quite common and is efficient under moderatehigh loadsp

Negative 12752 pLooking into the .NET code, codeRectangle.Sizecode returns codenew SizeWidth, Heightcode.

Can we show that all cycles of length more then 3 will always involve a cycle of length 3. remember t is connected to every v1,v2...vn and there is no pair wise cycle.p  pExplaining the problem further.p  pSay the acyclic directed graph of vertices v1,v2,v3..vn is v1v2v3...vn. Each v has an edge to t. Say there is a cycle tv1v2v3t. Such a cycle seems to surely involve a cycle of length 3 i.t either tv1v2t or tv2v3t. But an not being able to proof this. p  pThanksp

Negative 12752 pIve created a quick test to show what Im trying to dop  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netzY3HH relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netzY3HHap  pIf you click the Toggle Width button once, a square will take one second to grow to full width. Click it again, and it will take one second to shrink down to zero width.p  pHowever, click the Toggle Width button twice in rapid succession  the second time when the square has grown to only a small fraction of its total width like 10  youll notice that the animation still takes a full second to return the square to zero width, which looks awkward, IMO.p  pWhile that behavior is expected, Id like the latter animation to happen in an amount of time thats proportional to the width that its covering. In other words, if you click Toggle Width a second time when the square is at 10 of its total width, Id like it to take about 110th of a second to shrink back to zero width.p  pIt should be relatively easy I think to make the value of the codedurationcode property dynamic, calculated when the jQuery codeclickcode handler is run, to measure the current width of the square and determine the duration accordingly.p  pHowever, am I missing a better way to do this Does jQuery provide an easy way, or expose some sort of method or property to make this easierp

Negative 12752 pIn WPF, custom commands have event handlers such as commandExecuted and commandCanExecute, the best practice is that the implementation logic should not be directly implemented in the codebehind class, and it should only contain function calls to the higher level implementation logic.p  pWhile making custom commands, if there is only one function call in the handler functions of the command, it is simple to place it directly in the codebehind, but what if there are multiple function calls, or function calls returning something on the basis of which a decision is to be made specially in the case of commandCanExecute function that is disablingenabling a command, has to make a decision when to enable or disable a command. The possibilities I have been thinking about are following, which one is most appropriate in terms of maintainablilty, keeping code clean, software engineering principles, and best practicep  ol lipKeep all the function calls and decision making statements in the codebehind in commandexecute or some function in the codebehind that commandexecute calls. It is fine if code is simple, but makes things ugly when there are many handlers in the code behind. Here there is no implementation code, only decision making code that i have mentioned earlier.pli lipKeep the implementation logic in the class that defines the command and makes it accessible through static properties. Now the handler in the codebehind will only have 1 function call and will receive the return value if it has to.pli lipImplement it in the higher level classes that implement the actual functionality of the application, so that the codebehind handler has only one function call. This makes the most sense, but this option creates doubts in my mind because in some cases, the command handler may have to call methods from many different unrelated classes, so where to place that logic is difficult to decide.pli lipAny other that I have missed.pli ol

Negative 12752 pI am facing certain problems with strlen right nowthere are many cases where I read files and the string is not zero terminated. So I was thinking of making an assembly routine to calculate the length of my strings. What I would do is just go backwards from the end of the string until I encounter my first character and then calculate the length of the string. In fact I already have one that I wrote some time ago when I was writing assembly programs. p  pNow, I would like to know, is there any reason why I shouldnt do this Any particular advantages that I would be losing out on p  pAnother alternate would be just make each member of my character array to null. I could do this in assembly 4 bytes at a time, or even through a simple for loop. p  pKeep in mind that I am talking about considerable size arrays[64k]. Considerable in the length that the processing has to be really quick, since I need to display the file as soon as the user selects it.p  pEDIT To clarify, by saying that I know that I know the length of the string, I meanp  precodechar buffer  new char[length] codepre  pI know codelengthcode. But when I fill this buffer, I do not know the exact length up till which it has ascii characters. When I use codestrlencode, it does not give me the current length. Basically the codelengthcode can be 500, but there can be only 5 valid characters inside it and the rest 495 could be garbage values.p

Negative 12752 pThe reason I ask is that wed like to use a certain CHECK constraint which MySQL currently doesnt suport. Without this type of constraint in place, the whole reason for using foreign keys and referential integrity seems to diminish as the application code takes on more of the databases responsibilities.p  pIf we were to create a dumb data model and move all of the referential integrity checking to a layer in the application code, then potentially testing could be simpler as referential integrity errors would be trapped in the application rather than the db. It could also potentially speed up development of new modules, as they wouldnt necessarily have to be referentially complete is that a term before testing.p  pSo, are there any other benefits to sticking with a proper data model in MySQL and keeping foreign keys and ON UPDATE CASCADE statements, etcp  pOr, should we ditch MySQL and move to something elsep  pThanksp

Negative 12752 pIm developing an app with sdk 11 Honeycomb. In this app I make use of hardware acceleration at application level to make animations smoother and without it, they are unacceptably sluggish. Since my client really wants to have them, I have to find another solution than turning the acceleration off.p  pThe problem itself is that I have an codeActivitycode which contains few codeWebViewcode elements. 3, to be exact  1 is always shown and 2 others are used for preloading pages, so they are invisible I mean positioned off the screen, but still visible. I use translation animation to switch between them. With hardware acceleration on, they render web pages incorrectly  I get big, flickering black boxes over the page. This is of course unacceptable, so I bypassed the problem by turning hardware acceleration off for all WebViewsp  precodewebView.setLayerTypeView.LAYERTYPESOFTWARE, null codepre  pIve also tried to set this in xml file codeandroidlayerTypesoftwarecode, but it worked exactly the same way as it should be. Anyway, both those methods work pretty well  the animations and WebViews are smooth enough and there are no artifacts. The problem arises however once the orientation changes. Even though I make no important distinctions between portrait and landscape mode in my code, it works like thisp  ul liActivity starts in portrait mode, change orientation to landscape, back to portrait, and so on. Everything works as expected.li liActivity starts in landscape mode. It works fine. Orientation changes to portrait. Artifacts start to show again. Most often whole screen just goes black with webpage showing through once in the blue moon when I scrollzoom the page. This is exactly the same as if the WebViews used hardware acceleration. Back to landscape  it works fine again. li ul  pThis had led me to think that the hardware acceleration might be the problem. I was proved myself right by trying to set software acceleration at different levels of view hierarchy to see if this strange behavior stops. I found out that it does indeed stop, and it works without bugs, but only once whole Activity is software accelerated, which is unacceptable to me my translation animations [slow scrolling in webviews]. If only viewsviewgroups in the layout xml file are set to be software accelerated, it still bugs. Is there anything about orientation changes which can trigger such behavior Any solutions, hacks, hints, suggestions, ideas, thoughts, however incomplete, are welcome  Im out of those.p  pIf you need more info or some code, I will gladly provide it to you. br  Thank you for your timep

Negative 12752 paccording to clean code by Robert C. Martin methods should have a small signature. The best case would be a method with no parameters at all. Instead it is recommended to use state variables. This is really usefull. But what about stateless session beansp  pThe name is kind of confusing because SLSB can have state. You just have to do your housekeeping so you dont use state from the previous EJB call.p  pGetting back to clean code Id love to use instance variabls in SLSBs too. This works fine and if youre carefull enough you dont have any trouble with state inconsitencies since the state is overwritten on each public method call.p  pSo far so good. But what happens if a used bean goes back to the pool It takes its state with it. Depending on the size of the state this could be a real memory leak. JBoss is very generous with beans and generates quite a bunch of them causing some serious memory consumption  for nothing.p  pSo one way would be to clean up the state before the bean method exists and the bean is returned to the pool. But this seems to me like useless code that should be avoided.p  pIs there a proper way to deal with this problem Whats the best practice in this situationp

Negative 12752 pI am developing an iOS app that will have a number of images. These images are associated with  Show object and Band objects. I am fairly new to iOS developmentp  pOn the server, the Shows and Bands are associated with a list of images. Currently I am storing the images with the following infop  precodeheightinteger widthinteger imageTypestring imageDatabinary codepre  pFirst question is should there be morep  pSecondly, I am persisting the Show and Band objects using Core Data. I do not want to persist the images because I would quickly run out of memory. I will store them in the cache directory. My second question is how should the Show and Band objects keep track of the images Should I have a Image objects in the model with a to many relationship with Shows and Bands. But these Image objects would perhaps only contain height, width, imageType and a path to where the cached image should be. My idea is that if it is not found in the cache directory, it gets the imageData from the server.p  pWhat is the right way to do thisp  pUPDATEp  pI also plan on pinging the server with HEAD to check if the imageData has been updated before getting the cached version.p

Negative 12752 pI am developing an Android application which uses some native code. The native library I am using comes with two variants, one for ARM v6 architecture and one for v7. Therefore in my libs folder  I have two folders, armeabi for the v6 lib and armeabiv7a for the v7 lib.

How would I approach this I just cant make a ajax request to the server every x seconds, since that would put an unnaceptable load on the system.

Negative 12752 pI am testing a codePhotoChooserTaskcode based Windows Phone 8 application in an emulator. I want to test a specific image.

Negative 12752 pIm tweaking a magento store for a wholesale company. Because this is a wholesale company, we only want to allow companies, not privatesindividuals, to create a new account. We want to do that by letting the store owner check the VAT number which is a required field in the registration form of the company, strongthen let him set the account to confirmed.strongp  pThe preferred way is to have a confirmation email sent to the store owner and a different notification mail to the customer saying that the confirmation is pending.

Negative 12752 pIn my app, Im using Core Data alongside an additional sqlite database that doesnt use Core Data. In this additional database, I have columns that store references to codeNSManagedObjectcode instances via each instances codeNSManagedObjectIDcode.p  pIm getting an instances codeobjectIdcode as a string for storage like thisp  precodeinstance.objectID.URIRepresentation.absoluteString codepre  pThis results in a string looking something likep  precodexcoredataEE13EA1ED5F44E38986D3F4B0B03AEE4ClassNamep658 codepre  pWhich I can later use to fetch the codeNSManagedObjectcode instance like thisp  precode[persistentStoreCoordinator managedObjectIDForURIRepresentation[NSURL URLWithStringuriString]] codepre  pAs these URI strings are verbose and contain redundant information, I would like to save just the unique aspect of each in order to conserve space in the db and improve query performance. So in the example above, just 658 rather than the whole URI string.p  pSo the first question is whats a good way to extract just the unique tail of an codeNSManagedObjectIDcode And secondly, once I have that stored, how can I later use it to fetch the instancep  pI would like to avoid string manipulation as that feels icky, but Ill consider it if its the only way. My only confusion there is where the EE13EA1ED5F44E38986D3F4B0B03AEE4 portion is coming from in the above example. How could I access that value in order to rebuild a valid URIp

Negative 12752 pIm looking for some advice on the best way to store long strings of data from the mySQL experts.p  pI have a general purpose table which is used to store any kind of data, by which I mean it should be able to hold alphanumeric and numeric data. Currently, the table structure is simple with an ID and the actual data stored in a single column as followsp  precode  id INT11   data VARCHAR128 codepre  pI now have a requirement to store a larger amount of data up to 500 characters and am wondering whether the best way would be to simply increase the varchar column size, or whether I should add a new column a TEXT type column for the times I need to store longer strings.p  pIf any experts out there has any advice Im all ears My preferred method would be to simply increase the varchar column, but thats because Im lazy  The mySQL version Im running is 5.0.77.p  pI should mention the new 500 character requirement will only be for the odd record most records in the table will be not longer than 50 characters. I thought Id be futureproofing by making the column 128. Shows how much I knew p

Negative 12752 pI really dont understand the meaning of tfs build although MSDN provides many definitions.p  pFor example, I have an asp.net project. If I passed the local build on my local machine and I checked in the code. Everything is fine.p  pI used to copypublish the code to the server, thats it.p  pWhy we need tfs build What is different between tfs build and local build. You might to say, there are build history that can be reverted to an old one.

According to paypal, there are only 2 variables that are posted with IPN across all transaction types, but there are a bunch of other variables that could possibly be posted. p  pIf a post variable is sent thats not in my action form, then struts returns an error about the form not having the propertysetter.p  pIPN has like 300 variables and I really dont want to have a field for all possible ones.  Is it possible in struts to accept post variables that my actionForm may not have accounted forp

Negative 12752 pI noticed the TFS and Ankh svn plugins for VS2010 will annotate the code.slncode file with a codeGlobalSectioncode that associates the solution with the corresponding source control provider.  So when opening a solution will automatically tell VS to switch to that SCP.  However the git plugin combination of git source control provider and git extensions for windows does not do this.  p  pSo whenever I open a git solution, VS just uses whatever the last source control provider I was using the previous time I used VS for emanyem solution, so I have to go through the ToolsOptions menu and update it manually every time I open a git solution.  p  pIs there a codeGlobalSectioncode that will tell VS to use git, or some other way to allow VS2010 to detect that its a git repop

Negative 12752 pIs there an alternative way of playing audio data other than using MediaPlayer. The audio comes from a resource and not a file.

Negative 12752 pI have in C Net 2.0 Windows Forms a ListView with about ten columns filled with data at startup of the application. The data is huge, so it cannot be reloaded fast inbetween. My ListView has the Details View on and allows the user the resizing of each column separately.p  pThe user shall be able to hide any of the ten columns or multiple of them at once and unhide the columns again any time in nonspecific row. The data shall be not deleted while hiding the column.p  pFollowing things I have tried but the result were not satisfyingp  p1 Resizing the column with size 0 will make it somewhat disappearing until the user starts to play with the columns. The user accidently will resize them back because in my ListView there is the option allowed for the user to resize each column manually.p  p2 With just deleting the column out occurs the following problem When I try to add the column back, the column doesnt remember its position and size. The position is the main problem, Ill try to explain why. If my user decides to first hide column 2 and then column 3 and the user later unhides 3 before 2, then Index 2 doesnt exist, so I cannot insert at Index No. 3 and an exception rises. Even if I remember the Index position before deleting I cannot simply put the Column just back to that index, because I dont know if previous columns where already hided too or which column is missing before and after or hided or not. So the scenario could be like that 1 shown, 2 hided, 3 hided too, 4 shown, 5 hided, 6 hided, 7 hided , 8 shown, 9 hided, 10 hided.p  pPossible solutions 1 and 2 are automatically out ruled in the scenario. Better is even making the width of the column to zero, but since my user shall be able to resize columns any time by need, with resizing to zero it cannot be hided from the user. The user will unhide it by resize and my system will think its still hidden etc. etc. and it looks not professional if hidden columns can be just resized back or how we could name that else.p  pHas someone a better idea Why the listView Column has no visible or hide property, I wonder If someone did that already before please post a solution.p  pstrongI have to add that I use autoresizing of all columns in my listview when data is being added. For this reason the answer below doesnt work. The resize event cant detect the width of 1. All invisible columns with width 0 will be resized back, when data was added. Since the listview cuts out data which overlaps column length, I need to autoresize it permanently. Explorer has not this problem because it fits the columns to the length of the data. C has not such advanced listview, here I have to set the columns to 1 each time when data being added. In this conception doesnt work the idea of column.width  0 for hiding the columns.strong p

Negative 12752 pThis is a rather general question about TCP sockets. I got a clientserver application setup where messages are sent over the wire via TCP. The implementation is done via C POCO, however the question is not related to a certain technology.p  pA message can be a request initiated by the client or a response initiated by the server.p  pA request has the structurep  precodeMessage Header Request Header Parameters codepre  pA response has the structurep  precodeMessage Header Response Header Parameters codepre  pI know TCP guarantees that sent packages will be delivered in the order they have been sent. However, nothing can be assumed about the timespan a delivery might need.p  pOn both sides I have a readsend timeout configured. Now I wonder how to have a clean set up on the transmitted data after a timeout. Dont know how to express this in the right terms, so let me describe an examplep  ol liServer S sends a response to the client Message Header, Response Header, Parameters are put into the streamli liClient C receives the message header partially e.g. the first 4 bytes of 12li liAfter these 4 bytes have been received, the reception timeout occursli liOn clientside, an appropriate exception is thrown, the reception will be stopped.li liThe client considers the package as invalid.li ol  pNow the problem is, when the client tries to receive another package, he might receive the lasting part of the old response message header. From the point of view of the currently processed transaction send requestget response, the client receives garbage.p  pSo it seems that after a timeout has occured no matter whether it has been on client or serverside, the communication should continue with a clean setup, meaning that none of the communication partners will try to send some old package data and that no old package data is stored within the stream buffer of the respective socket.p  pSo how are such situations commonly handled Is there some kind of design pattern  idiomatic way to solve this How are such situations handled within other TCPbased protocols, e.g. HTTPp  pIn all the TCP samples around the net Ive never seen an implementation that deals with those kind of problems...p  pThank you in advancep

Just curious if anyone has any solutions to this Or run into this issuep  pLike can I put the SASS and CSS in one folder, and when I create a new branch can it pull all the latest SASS and CSS into it, and when I push that it also updates the SASS and CSS in the main folderp  pI dunno sounds kinda confusing, not sure if that would work. p  pThe only other thing I can think of is maybe just using SASS, after I finish a branch push that... go into the other branches pull the new SASS files, delete the stylesheet, re compile the SASS into CSS and then push that. p  pSo then they always have the latest styles... However it just seems like a bit annoying to have to keep going in to a different branch and recompile. p  pOr is there any different workflow to not cause this issue at allp  pThanks heapsp
Negative 12752 pI am trying to implement exemplar based inpainting, as proposed by a hrefhttpresearch.microsoft.compubs67276criminisitip2004.pdf relnofollowCriminsia et. al. in its original format before moving into further optimisations.p  pI have a few theoretical doubts which I would like to clarify.p  pI am not sure how the patch priority and the determination of fillorder works to propagate linear structures into the userselected target region.p  pFrom what I understand, Criminsi suggests the followingp  ol liDetermine the fill front d.li liCompute the patch priorities [CpDp] on patches lying on the fill front.li liPropagate texture into the patches  in order of their patch priorities.li liUpdate confidence values.li liRecompute fill front d from the remaining unfilled section.li ol  pem[Repeat these 5 steps till all of the target region is filled].emp  pNow, if this understanding of the algorithm is correct and, please do correct me if the interpretation is wrong, I have the following doubtp  ul lipIf Im always filling patches from the fill front only, and if the patches are fixed in their spatial location w.r.t other patches on the fillfront, then I dont see how the order of fillingin matters. The patches are filled in by direct sampling of the source region, which stays constant for all iterations. Hence, I do not understand how the order of filling will result in any pixel level difference on the propagated textures. From what I gather, the best match from the source region should remain unaltered, irrespective of the order. What am I missing herepli lipBased on this a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchvUYk9fTZbAs relnofollowvideoa and assuming it is correct, the patch filling does not always occur on the fillfront only. How does this work Does this mean we are to compute the priorities for all patches in the target region at once and go on filling them based on their priorities Then, how does the fillfront determination matter and why does Criminsi determine d at all I understand Criminsis approach was a step ahead of the traditional onionpeel technique. But how, exactlypli ul  pI really wish to clarify these questions before I delve into 23 days of intense coding.p  pPlease help.p  pThanks in advance.p  pp  pOne more concern Im facing while implementing this algorithmp  pWhile propagating structure and texture information, Im directly sampling the source region for patches with minimal SSD of the already filled pixels in the two patches. p  pThe question bugging me is SSD of what I tried SSD of RGBHSV values but that did not work out. Ive just started referencing the a hrefhttpciteseerx.ist.psu.eduviewdocdownloaddoi10.1.1.87.5386ampreprep1amptypepdf relnofolloworiginal citationa of Criminisi for SSD, but Im just wondering... is there an easier way out p  pAny help would be appreciated.p

Negative 12752 pIm making a program in Python using Pygame that will load an image to the screen, open the raw data as in, the characters you would see if you opened the jpg as a text file, throw some random characters in with the data, and then resave it as a jpg to load into pygame again. This results in a cool looking glitch effect. p  pI am not having any problems with the emdesiredem glitches, but I was finding that despite what kind of random character was placed where, for certain images every time the image went through my glitch function I ended up with a grey bar on the bottom of the image. I simplified my function so that all it did was load the image, open the image as a read binary even though Im on a mac, save a string of the raw data, write a new file based on this string and then load that file. The image was not purposefully glitched in any way, and the data was supposedly untouched but I still encountered this grey bar. p  pHere is the relevant codep  precodedef initializeScreenx, y     pygame.display.setmodex,y     return pygame.display.getsurface  def importImagefileName     imgText  openfileName, rb     imgTextStr  imgText.read     imgText.close     return imgTextStr  screenSurf  initializeScreen800,600 textOfImg  importImageUsersAmoebaDesktopGlitchDrivingClouds.jpg newFile  openUsersAmoebaDesktopGlitchDrivingtempGlitchFile.jpg, wb newFile.writetextOfImg newimgSurf  pygame.image.loadUsersAmoebaDesktopGlitchDrivingtempGlitchFile.jpg screenSurf.blitnewimgSurf, 0,0 pygame.display.flip codepre  pHere is an example of one of the images before and after passing through my functionp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3XN4K.jpg altenter image description herep  pIt is worth noting that the size of the grey bar depends on the picture. Some pictures even pass through my function visibly unchanged, as they should be. Also, if I open the new version of the jpg written by my program with image viewing software like preview, the grey bar does not appear. My suspicion is that it is a quirk of the pygame image load function or that there is some strange character or possibly white space that is being dropped in my conversion from jpg to string or viceversa. I did compare two of the text files one with grey bar and one without and found no difference while using an online difference finder.p  pThis is my first post here, but Ive lurked for answers dozens of times. Any help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 12752 pIs there a way to compile source code with codegcode, and have the compiler warn me if I have not included a file in another file where I should havep  pFor example, in a large project it is often quite easy to write some code in codefileAcode, which uses another function from codefileCcode which contains the function declaration, but forget to add the include statement. Such an error can be hidden if codefileAcode also includes another file, codefileBcode, where codefileBcode includes codefileCcode.p  pThis will then compile without error, however if the code is modified at a later date, and we remove the codeinclude fileB.hppcode from codefileAcode, then compilation will fail, because we originally forgot to include codefileCcode many months agop  pIs there a compiler switch which will warn us about this problem Similarly, is there the reverse switch, which will warn us when we codeincludecode something which is unnecessaryp
Negative 12752 pIm working on Learn python the hard way and am not a very experienced programmer and I have searched on Stackoverflow and other programming websites but I have not found the answer to my question. Well anyway my question is how do you import files into another file in python what I have seen is that many people have answered this by saying that you should just put codeimport filenamecode but when I do this I get the error codeTraceback most recent call last   File source.py, line 1, in ltmodulegt     import one ImportError No module named filenamecode so how do I import a file without getting this error. if anybody would like to know where to go to see why Im asking question go to a hrefhttplearnpythonthehardway.orgbookex45.html relnofollowhttplearnpythonthehardway.orgbookex45.htmla. Im also using a chromebook so I have an app named source lair instead of the traditional python software, so if anybody has a chromebook or chromeos computer please give me suggestions as to if this is a good app and if theres a better app. ps you can download the app from the chrome store on any operating system.p  precodeprint thanks codepre
Negative 12752 pIve got this template that parses multiple items of a slice onto the page. It does that really well.p  pHowever, I now want to use the very same template to parse a single value of the slice, based on the range index. The slice is used in multiple files so I cant just .Execute it like Slice[12]p  precode bpi  .Index   range i, elmt  .Slice       if bpi.Equals i        ltdivgt .SliceContent ltdivgt      end   end  codepre  pFrom what Ive read is that the template isnt ment for computation, but if youve got a range index and ifstatements in the htmltemplate package it seems to me that I must be doing something wrong. I can write a FuncMap ofcourse, no problemo. But it doesnt seem right to me given these facts.p

Negative 12752 pWere trying to embed Magnoliamanaged content into some of the JSPs of an existing web app. In Tomcat we deployed and set up a magnoliaAuthor context that runs along our existing app context.p  pSo, for example, wed like an existing JSP such as codeapptest.jspcode to include a Magnolia page such as codemagnoliaAuthorfootercode just a div. In the browser the path codemagnoliaAuthorfootercode renders fine, but were facing issues when trying to include that into codeapptest.jspcode usingp  ul licodecimportcodeli licodejspincludecodeli ul  pand the like, with both relative and absolute paths to codemagnoliaAuthorfootercode..p  pAt most were getting the followingp  pServer returned HTTP response code 401 for URL codehttplocalhost8080magnoliaAuthorfootercode when an absolute URL is used. This seems like the request was rejected by Magnolia..p  pWe couldnt find an exact description of how this use case should be put together. Any hint will be appreciated.p  pThank you.p
Negative 12752 pI need to create a control, that behaves like a textbox, but allows you to replace some or all of the characters with pictures that behave select and remove with backspacedelete as a normal characters.p  pI tried to create a RichTextBox inherited control, with CanPaste  Paste construction, but the images added this way didnt act like the characters, but as the images which can be resized. Its not a correct solution for me.p  pSo, the question is How can I override symbol drawing method I mean, get actual x,y coordinates of drawing character, and draw picture instead of it or in front of it. Is that possiblep  pControl should look similar to this picture. lockers on picture are images, acting like symbols. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comb4sjo.png altwhat I want to achievep  pUPD strongControl must be working on systems from XP to 8strong, so using UTF8 lockstyle symbol wont be a solution for me. Control shown on the screenshot above works in an application that is running on a Windows XP  though I have no idea which way it was implemented.p

Negative 12752 pHello fellow developers,p  pIll try to spell this question out as clearly as possible so that its available for years to come via keyword searches.  Hopefully I do this site some justice for the value this will add to others.p  pBackground  Im working in an Excel workbook where I have worksheets setup like data tables in tabs linked to a secondary worksheet housing Pivot tables and then a third worksheet with the Chart View of the pivot.  Im using Linear trendlines with Slicers to drill down the views to analyze trends.p  pProblem When I change the View Chart with a slicer selection option or options, the trendlines disappear.p  pRequest I want to be able to drill down the views from various selection options using slicer while still maintaining the trendlines of the new view.  Additionally, I want the trendlines to maintain their associated chart object color schema.p  pSimple Example Dataset  Column A titled Vendor, Column B titled Amount, Column C titled Quarter. Pivot  Legend Field Series  Vendor, Axis Field Categories  Quarter, Values  sum of Amount Chart  Displays Vendors sum of Amount quarter over quarter. Trendlines  Linear trends associated with each vendor showing spend spend  Amount trend. Slicers  Vendor, Quarterp  pReiterated Problem If I populate the trendlines for the default viewusing a routine or manually through GUIs, then drill down into the view using the slicers example would be to narrow the Quarter selections, the trendlines disappear.  p  pHeres some Pseudo code logic that Id like to convert into code.  Im listing my logic and not my broken code because I think its helpful for us developers to approach this from an unbiased perspective. p  pLogical Steps  Upon button click or chart.change,  1. clear all trendlines  2. Count the number of chart objects 3. Execute a loop that writes an add trendline to each chart object but stops at last object. 4. Color code the trendline to match the associated chart object its trending.p  pThank you for your help in advance  This will help a lot of us analysts out there using Excel for dashboards vs. web applications.p
Negative 12752 pIve been attempting to make a 2D spacelike game using Java just for the fun of it. Ive decided just to use Javas Graphics2D to render my game because I wasnt in the mood to learn LWJGL. However, I just now realized how limited it is. For example, I realized a nice bloomglow effect would look really nice. However, I cant find anything on Google about doing so with Graphics2D and without using another library. p  pWhat bloom effect Im looking forbr a hrefhttpgamedev.stackexchange.comquestions18594howcanimakethisstyleof2dglowinggraphicshttpgamedev.stackexchange.comquestions18594howcanimakethisstyleof2dglowinggraphicsap  pBloom informationbr a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBloom28shadereffect29httpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBloom28shadereffect29a p  h3So the main question is, does anyone know of a good method to add a sharp bloom shader effect using Graphics2Dh3

Negative 12752 pNot so long ago I was hunting a bug in some big number library I was writing, it costed me quite a while. The problem was that I violated the memory bounds of some structure member, but instead of a codesegmentation faultcode or just a plain crash, it did something unexpected at least I did not expect it. Let me introduce a examplep  pstrongsegmentationfault.cstrongp  precodeinclude ltstdlib.hgt include ltstdio.hgt include lterrno.hgt include ltsignal.hgt  define N 100  arbitrary large number   typedef unsigned char byte  void exitErrorchar  void segmentationFaultSignalHandlerint  sigatomict segmentationFaultFlag  0   int mainvoid      int i, memorySize  0     byte memory     if setvbufstdout, NULL, IONBF, 0         exitErrorsetvbuf failed     if signalSIGSEGV, segmentationFaultSignalHandler  SIGERR         exitErrorsignal failed     for i  0 i lt N i              printfBefore mallocn         if memory  mallocmemorySize  sizeofbyte  NULL             exitErrorallocation failed         printfAfter mallocn         printfBefore segmentation faultn         memory[memorySize]  0x0D  segmentation fault          if segmentationFaultFlag             exitErrordetected segmentation fault         printfAfter segmentation faultn         printfBefore freen         freememory         printfAfter freen          return 0    void segmentationFaultSignalHandlerint signal      segmentationFaultFlag  1    void exitErrorchar errorMessage      printfERROR s, errnod.n, errorMessage, errno     exit1  codepre  pAs we can see the line codememory[memorySize]  0x0Dcode is clearly violating the memory bounds given by codemalloccode, but it does not crash or raise a signal I know according to ISO C99  ISO C11 the signal handling is implementation defined and does not have to raise at all when violating memory bounds. It moves on printing the lines codeAfter segmentation faultcode, codeBefore freecode and codeAfter freecode, but after a couple of iterations later it crashes, always at codefreecode printing codeAfter segmentation faultcode and codeBefore freecode, but not codeAfter freecode. I was wondering what causes this behavior and what is the best way to detect memory access violations Im ashamed, but I always kinda used codeprintfcodes to determine where a program crashed, but sure there must be better tools to do that as it is very hard to detect most often it does not crash at the code of violation, but, as in the example, later in the code, when trying to do something with this memory again. Surely I should be able to free this memory as I allocated it right and did not modify the pointer.p

Another tenant might define Shipment as Shipment Ref, Ship Date, Owner etc...

Negative 12752 pIm exploring some options for changing Oracle user passwords via a Java application utilizing the JDBC.  To preface my question with a little background, Im using Oracle 11gR2 as my RDBMS platform and do not have a license for the Advanced Security Option.  p  pWhat Id like to do is change several user account passwords based on GUI input.

So I gotp  ul lisda1 boot             243Moli lisda2                   698.40Goli lisda5 ubuntuvg         698.Goli ul  pI dont know why I dont have sda3 and sda4 but I think he had several partitions before I installed ubuntu on it so i think its because of that. p  pAnyway, The thing is the only partition I could resize is the sda2 which is the same as my sda5. But GParted shows it as all yellow that means I cannot resize it. p  pHowever, I dont think Ubuntu use 700Go to run so my question is Does someone know why it is happening and how could I change it to be able to resize the big partitionp  pThanks p

What is more, a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.uielement.inputbindings28vvs.11029.aspxcodeInputBindingscodea is not a dependency property, so I cannot bind that to a common source such as a list of input bindings located in the viewmodel that the codeItemGestureTextcode property could be bound to, as well.p  pNow, many resources a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4682915definingmenuitemshortcutsthis questiona, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3335378howtoassignctrlcontrolpluscommaasthekeyboardshortcuttoawpfmenuthat questiona, a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsvstudioenUS7f5228e03a3e4bdeae7012c77972f2a0menuitemandkeybindingquestionforumwpfthis threada, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1361350keyboardshortcutsinwpfthat questiona and a hrefhttpsocial.msdn.microsoft.comForumsvstudioenUSc33466a86d4a43279db1423e216e3814displayingcustomcommandsshortcutsinmenuforumwpfthat threada point out that a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.input.routedcommand28vvs.11029.aspxcodeRoutedCommandcodea and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.input.routeduicommand28vvs.11029.aspxcodeRoutedUICommandcodea contain a builtin a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.input.routedcommand.inputgestures28vvs.11029.aspxcodeInputGesturescode propertya and imply that key bindings from that property are automatically displayed in menu items.p  pHowever, using either of those codeICommandcode implementations seems to open a new can of worms, as their a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.input.routedcommand.execute28vvs.11029.aspxcodeExecutecodea and a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.input.routedcommand.canexecute28vvs.11029.aspxcodeCanExecutecodea methods are not virtual and thus cannot be overridden in subclasses to fill in the desired functionality.

My understanding is that addingp  precodeSystem.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture  new System.Globalization.CultureInfodede System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture  System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture codepre  pto the codeMainWindowcode constructor should make sure that localizable strings supplied by the framework should be taken from the German codeCultureInfocode  however, codeCtrlcode does not change to codeStrgcode, so unless I am mistaken about how to set the codeCultureInfocode for frameworksupplied strings, this method is not viable anyway if I expect the displayed shortcut to be correctly localized.p  pNow, I am aware that a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.input.keygesture28vvs.11029.aspxcodeKeyGesturecodea allows me to specify a custom display string for the keyboard shortcut, but not only is the codeRoutedCommandcodederived codeDoSomethingCommandcode class disjoint from all of my instances from where I could get in touch with the loaded localization due to the way codeCommandBindingcode has to be linked with a command in XAML, the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.input.keygesture.displaystring28vvs.11029.aspxrespective codeDisplayStringcode propertya is readonly, so there would be no way to change it when another localization is loaded at runtime.p  pThis leaves me with the option to manually dig through the menu tree EDIT for the sake of clarification, no code here because I am not asking for this and I know how to do this and the codeInputBindingscode list of the window to check which commands have any codeKeyBindingcode instances associated with them, and which menu items are linked to any of those commands, so that I can manually set the codeInputGestureTextcode of each of the respective menu items to reflect the first or preferred, by whichever metric I want to use here keyboard shortcut. And this procedure would have to be repeated every time I think the key bindings may have changed. However, this seems like an extremely tedious workaround for something that is essentially a basic feature of a menu bar GUI, so Im convinced it cannot be the correct way to do this.p  pstrongWhat is the right way to automatically display a keyboard shortcut that is configured to work for WPF codeMenuItemcode instancesstrongp  pEDIT All of the other questions I found dealt with how a codeKeyBindingcodecodeKeyGesturecode could be used to actually enable the functionality visually implied by codeInputGestureTextcode, without explaining how to automatically link the two aspects in the described situation.

Negative 12752 pI am working on a mapping project using Google Maps. We have a variety of different types of data that we are displaying with different geographical boundaries. Some of the data comes from the client and is very restricted in terms of privacy and cannot be sent to the server side for processing. One of the goals of our project is to interpolate the different data sets to a common regularlysized grid for comparison and analysis. I would like to be able to visualize the grid on the map. The grid matrix is about 120x150, so about 18000 total cells with a single scalar value. This is too many polygons to render using native Google Maps drawing. Since it is a regularly sized grid, it seems like a good solution would be to render the grid as an image and overlay that on the map as a single entity. Since I cannot send the data to the server for processing, I was trying to think of a way to do this completely in javascript. I know that datauris can be used in css, and I believe in javascript too, to store small images as strings. I am not sure if google maps will accept this natively, but that will be a separate issue. For now I am just curious whether or not anyone has implemented a javascript imagegenerator using the datauri model. And if so, how. I have searched but not found any attempts. I have looked at file specifications, but thought Id ask here before delving too deep into a wild goose chase  reinventing the wheel. I know that I could use a canvas element to do this in a way that is makes more sense in terms of code readability, but it seems like generating a string directly, would be an elegant solution.p

Negative 12752 pSo this one has me stumped. I need to take a codeHTMLcode table and generate a line graph that represents the number of entries per month. I currently have codeDataTablescode creating the table for me and the source data can not be modified. I will be using a hrefhttpwww.flotcharts.org relnofollowFlota to generate the line graph for me.

I think the best approach is to take the codencode value and make it a variables name so I would have a variable defined as 2 and then I could just do something like code2code. This way for each month returned as a number I will have a variable that is named after that number and it would contain the number of times it was present in the .each function. This would also limit the variables to only months that where present and will allow me to simply create the dataset I need to pass. p  pI dont have much experience with working with JavaScript in the manner so any help is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 12752 pI just installed VS2013. As there is no longer the Setup Project, I installed InstallShield LE. I used integrated import wizard and hoped any newer build would automatically update older versions created with VS Setup project. Well, I used to alter the Product Version, which prompted me to alter the Product Code, and that was it. Now I thought this should work with InstallShield as well, so I updated the product version and manually generated the product code.

Negative 12752 pI have the code section below which is a simple AJAX call to retrieve a JSON string from a .ASMX VB .NET Web Method.

The loop executes, data is received and I have already tested with alerts just to make sure Im not going crazy.p  pWhen I use the exact same line substituting test data for the JSON string to append my new list items, everything works fine.p  pAs a side note for anyone that might be wondering why I believe I have to use this methodology It is important that I call the AJAX function the way I do, so I may pass multiple parameters to the function when I build the list.  The other parameters allow me to specifically find which element is active in my user control.p  pI am relatively new to using AJAX as well.

Negative 12752 pIs it possible to create a product with different colors where each different color points to the same stockp  pFor example, I have created a configurable product with a color attribute. After creating the configurable product I create a couple of associated simple products for a few different colors. Instead of having each color have its own product qty  stock, I want all the colors to share the same stock.p  pSo for example the configurable product is a lamp. The associated simple products are lamp green, lamp red etc. I want to tell Magento that the lamp product has 10 in stock.

Negative 12752 pim writing an alarm clock app, with a special twist to it. not going to get into detail. anyways, im trying to think of the best way to save the alarms. i figured, since its a pretty basic app, it wouldnt require core data. so i was going to save them under NSUserDefaults. i used NSCoding to encode the objects, but i cant for the life of me figure out which key to use when saving them. Originally, i was going to use a key for each one. but that would involve searching NSUserDefaults keys for any that start with x memory heavy. also id have to find am efficient method to increment the key and circle back around when a key is deleted. so then i tried adding the alarms to a dictionary i tried an array, too and adding THAT object to NSUserDefaults. to no avail. can somebody help me figure out the best way to do this if it has to be core data, so be it. i just figured it was overkill for something as simple as adding alarm instances. shooting for user defaults.p

Negative 12752 pI have an Ext checkbox that add a layer on my OpenLayers map. When a layer is added from map.addLayer, it appears at the end on top of the layers we can see this in the layerSwitcher. I simply want to reorder them after I create the new layer. The problem is coming from the checkbox. I launch a function when checked, but the map wont be added until the function has ended I dont know why. So when I add the line to reorder the maps at the end of the function, it doesnt reorder the maps at all it seems this is because the same is still not created while inside the function.p  pThis is the code of my checkboxp  precodenew Ext.form.Checkbox     title extjsguiproductsanalysescheckboxtitle,     id analysescheckboxextjs,     boxLabel extjsguiproductsanalysescheckboxlabel,     inputValue extjsguiproductsanalysescheckboxlabel,     listeners          check addAnalyseLayer  reorderGmlLayersOnTop       codepre  pI thought I could add the line to reorder in another function then, and call it just after So I made a function named emreorderGmlLayersOnTopem and tried to add it as another codecheck reorderGmlLayersOnTopcode.

Negative 12752 pIm sending a good bit of data to my Pebble, but some of it keeps getting dropped. I realized that part of this was due to the buffer size not being large enough for the codePebbleDictionarycode that I was sending it, so I broke it up into multiple small ones instead. However, this introduces the issue with getting an codeAPPMSGBUSYcode error.p  pThis may be happening because Im not waiting for an acknack from the pebble, but instead just sending data back to back to back. I thus tried adding acknack handlers as well as a queue, but I was unable to get that to work due to my codesendMessagecode function blocking the main UI thread while waiting for the acknack handlers.p  pThus, my question is what the best way of handling this particular instance of codeAPPMSGBUSYcode is. I dont want any of the data I send to get dropped, so that means either waiting for acknowledgements before sending the next piece of data, or resending after getting a nack. If possible, Id like to avoid threading, but I havent been able to come up with a reasonable solution that doesnt involve threading.p  pEDIT To the best of my knowledge, there are no bugs in the pebble code. It will ask for data with the correct key, and it will acknowledge automatically any messages sent by the android app.p  pIf you would like, Ive posted my code belowp  pCurrent code relevant part of android appp  precodepublic class MainActivity extends ActionBarActivity       private PebbleDataReceiver mReceiver     private PebbleAckReceiver ackReceiver     private PebbleNackReceiver nackReceiver      ConcurrentLinkedQueueltBoolDictionarygt queue  new ConcurrentLinkedQueueltBoolDictionarygt      final UUID PEBBLEAPPUUID  UUID.fromString2ef1h2ba1a5941f787da797beca4d395     final static int CONTACTSNEEDED  0x0     final static int CONTACTSSIZE  0x1     final static int NEWMESSAGE  0x2     final static int NEWCONVERSATION  0x3     final static int RECORDNEWMESSAGE  0x4      Thread sendMessages  new Thread         public void run              while true                 PebbleKit.sendDataToPebbleWithTransactionIdgetApplicationContext, PEBBLEAPPUUID, queue.element.getDict, queue.element.getTransId                  try                      queue.element.wait                  catch InterruptedException e                       TODO Autogenerated catch block                                   if queue.element.isAkced                     break                                            queue.remove             if queue.size gt 0                 run                          else if queue.size  0                 queue.element.wait                                 public BoolDictionary createBoolDictionaryint key, int data         PebbleDictionary dict  new PebbleDictionary         dict.addInt32key, data         return new BoolDictionarydict           public BoolDictionary createBoolDictionaryint key, String data         PebbleDictionary dict  new PebbleDictionary         dict.addStringkey, data         return new BoolDictionarydict           Override     protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState          super.onCreatesavedInstanceState         setContentViewR.layout.activitymain         sendMessages.start          ackReceiver  new PebbleAckReceiverPEBBLEAPPUUID              Override             public void receiveAckContext context, int transactionId                  if queue.element.getTransId  transactionId                     queue.element.setAkcedtrue                     queue.element.notifyAll                                                                nackReceiver  new PebbleNackReceiverPEBBLEAPPUUID             Override             public void receiveNackContext context, int transactionId                  if queue.element.getTransId  transactionId                     queue.element.setAkcedfalse                     queue.element.notifyAll                                                            mReceiver  new PebbleDataReceiverPEBBLEAPPUUID              Override             public void receiveDataContext context, int transactionId, PebbleDictionary data                   PebbleKit.sendAckToPebblecontext, transactionId                  if data.containsCONTACTSNEEDED                                          test data                     queue.addcreateBoolDictionary0x5, Entry 1                     queue.addcreateBoolDictionary0x6, Entry 2                     queue.addcreateBoolDictionary0x7, Entry 3                     queue.addcreateBoolDictionary0x8, Entry 4                     queue.addcreateBoolDictionary0x9, Entry 5                     queue.element.notifyAll                                                  PebbleKit.registerReceivedDataHandlerthis, mReceiver         PebbleKit.registerReceivedAckHandlerthis, ackReceiver         PebbleKit.registerReceivedNackHandlerthis, nackReceiver           Override     protected void onPause         super.onPause         unregisterReceivermReceiver         unregisterReceiverackReceiver         unregisterReceivernackReceiver       codepre  pBoolDictionaryp  precodepublic class BoolDictionary extends PebbleDictionary     private PebbleDictionary dict     private boolean akced  false     private int transId      BoolDictionaryPebbleDictionary data         this.setDictdata         setTransIdnew Random.nextIntInteger.MAXVALUE           [insert getters and setters here]  codepre  pWhich generates the following errorsp  precode0701 104306.096 EAndroidRuntime21941 FATAL EXCEPTION Thread5310 0701 104306.096 EAndroidRuntime21941 Process com.example.firstapp, PID 21941 0701 104306.096 EAndroidRuntime21941 java.util.NoSuchElementException 0701 104306.096 EAndroidRuntime21941    at java.util.AbstractQueue.elementAbstractQueue.java107 0701 104306.096 EAndroidRuntime21941    at com.example.firstapp.MainActivity1.runMainActivity.java366 codepre

Negative 12752 pI have a Ruby on Rails app. After codeusershomecode is rendered, it sends an ajax call to codeusersfeedcode. The action codefeedcode performs a query and sends a list of users to codefeed.js.erbcode in which I can mix javascript and erb to render the users on the page. However, to make the code neat, Id like to create a javascript function that takes the database object list of users as input and renders them on the page. This way I can use this function in other pages, too. What is the best way to do that Is it possible to convert the activerecord database object to some javascript object that I can easily work with do things similar to users[0].name, users[2].address, etc One way would be to convert to json or string, but I can get the information such as users[0].name easily out of the string.p  pHere is part of the code in codefeed.js.erbcodep  precodefunction showUsers    lt if users.empty gt     alertno change   lt else gt     lt users.each do user gt       lt j user.id gt.htmllt j user.name gt     lt end gt   lt end gt  showUsers codepre  pThanks.p

Negative 12752 pSorry if this was already asked, but I really didnt find anything that applies exactly to my problem.p  pWell, although I know that an AngularJS form value must be loaded from controllers and that I can create routes and RESTful resources with AngularJS, I am using Python and Flask to get the page and data but AngularJS to post data to the server. The problem is, when I put ngmodel within a text input, the value from server is ignored, like sop  precodeltinput typetext ngmodelfirstname valueuser.firstnamegt codepre  pis interpreted asp  precodeltinput typetext ngmodelfirstname valueJohn classngpristine ngvalidgt codepre  pbut the value cannot be seen, as if there is no value attribute.p  pGiven that situation, I tried to use directives, but I didnt realise how to get this server data and share it with another scope.p  pWhat I want is to simply load a page with server data inside a ngmodel input and access it through controller methods later placeholder is useless here.p  pI am sending the page like thisp  precodeclass ShowUserMethodView     def getself         s  Sessionrequest         if s.islogged             user  dictusername s.user.username, firstname s.user.firstname, lastname s.user.lastname,                          email s.user.email, logged True             return rendertemplateusersshowuser.html, useruser         else             user  dictusername null, logged False             return rendertemplateindex.html, useruser codepre  pIts that user variable in rendertemplate that I am trying to access.p

Just go   to your app, then choose the Settings menu, and finally the Advanced   tab.

Negative 12752 pIm trying to figure out something that is nicely documented, but Im not quite getting my head around it trying to match a cell using INDEX and MATCH based on 2 criteria.p  pa hrefhttpexceltactics.comvlookupmultiplecriteriausingindexmatch relnofollowhttpexceltactics.comvlookupmultiplecriteriausingindexmatchap  pThe example documented above is a more complex case than mine, and with more columns. My case is simpler, but the model still fits. First, here is my spreadsheet with lookup table embedded green blockp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com7fkv7.png altenter image description herep  pThe lightgreen block is my lookup table containing all sites and subsites. The ultimate objective is to grab the SubSiteID based on the Site and SubSite. Notice the red text in cells G2G4. These are the desired outcomes for the top 3 rows. To discover the SubSiteID, first find the site, which is Farmington Bus Park. In the green block youll see that twice, but only 1 row with West in the subsite  thus we find the correct SubSiteID of 569. p  pThe 2nd example Clearfield High School has no SubSite, so the SubSiteID is 0. Easy.p  pThe 3rd example Clinton City Park has a subsite of West, so by looking in the green block youll find the SubSiteID of 558.p  pI need a formula that will look at F2 and H2 for example, find their matches in the green table, and return the SubSiteID when there is one.p  pYou can ignore both SiteID columns, unless it makes more sense to base the lookup on that, rather than the site name.p  pThe example formula in the article noted above is this p  precodeINDEXC4H1159,MATCH1,C4C1159A2D4D1159B2,0,6 codepre  pIm having trouble applying that formula to my particular case. If you can show the formula to match my worksheet Ill be most grateful.p  pSpreadsheet a hrefhttpwww.usaarbiters.comSchedule.xlsx relnofollowhttpwww.usaarbiters.comSchedule.xlsxap

Negative 12752 pI have a slickgrid screen on regular Domino form wherein user can select and update some documents. I needed to show a popup displaying status of every selected document so I created an XPage. In my XPage I am looping through selected documents array json and call an RPC method for every document.

Negative 12752 pI have an internal system log file which I have been parsing via and external Hive table and a Regex statement. But recently, issues in the output data have emerged with parts of the XML data incomplete in the Output result set. After further investigation, the issue is down to formatted text in the XML data being passed into the logs.br Traditionally, each log message is contained on a single line and the regex statement works fine but when a message contains formatted text, it pushes parts of the message onto one or more lines and so the XML data is chopped when parsed.br The issue I have is that I need to some how piece together the complete message back into one line so that the regex can successfully parse the whole message and not chop any data. p  pBelow is sample of the data I am dealing with. p

Negative 12752 pIm trying to print a form in VS 2010 on 8.5 x 11 paper.

Ive tried so many different things drawing part of it, drawing the whole thing...Ive had very little success so far.

Negative 12752 pHere is a tricky project I got at college that the instructor never got around to giving us the solution to. It was to load a multipage jQuery mobile site dynamically using jQuery Ajax XML parser. Firstly I had to load the unordered list with list items from an xml file that would be used as links. Then I had to load all the seperate pages from the xml as well these pages would have ids and be called by the links in the unordered list.  The question is how do I load two seperate items on the same site, does it require seperate calls to the xml. Also is it actually possible to populate a container div with dynamically loaded div datarolepages. Here is my script that is contained in the head with the attempt at loading datarolepages greyed out.

In the event that the user should decide to reactivate that same account, the software should simply remove the deleted flag, and perform a standard codeauth.logincode with freshly user provided usernamepassword...p  pstrongUPDATE 2strong The only small problem with this approach if it is a problem is that a user who wants to recover a deleted account, emmustem remember old password, since we did not remove firebasesimplelogin account...

Negative 12752 pI am having a very annoying issue...p  pI have a game with pixelbased art, so the textures used are 8x8 and then scaled up to 128x128 or whatever is needed.p  pTo do this, all I need to do is say codetexture.filteringMode  SKTextureFilteringNearestcodep  pNow that works for almost everything except for texture atlases. Pulling a texture from a texture atlas causes the texture to refuse to switch filtering modes. One thing to note is that it seems to work from the standard process of setting up a texture atlas, but it doesnt work when my texture atlas is a singleton.p  pNow usually, I would just figure that Im setting it up wrong, but I think this issue is on SpriteKit. Heres whyp  p1 The bug didnt happen until recently, and I hadnt changed anythingp  p2 The bug only happens in iOS 7 not in 7.1 or 8p  p3 The issue is not that the filtering mode is wrong the filtering mode is set to 0, which is nearest I tested it, logged every frame, and the mode was right but it was visually incorrectp  pSo its a rendering bug. But that doesnt make sense, especially when it seemed to work for a bit. Anyone else have any input I appreciate anything, Ill be trying a couple more things too. Thanksp  pNote I want to emphasize that the code asis works just fine in ios7.1, so the code works in some form... but it also isnt a 7.1 unique feature as it worked for me at one point.p

I am not sure about the next steps. Most of the configuration I found on the net says, paste the CSR in the enrollment form. But I went to Thawte, Godaddy, Verisign, I am unable to see any enrollment form to paste CSR.

Negative 12752 pI read a lot of documentations and topics about playing keyboard clicks, but I cant get it to work in my app...p  pI designed a custom keyboard as a UIView subview, which adopts the UIInputViewAudioFeedback protocol, and returns YES for the codeenableInputClicksWhenVisiblecode method.p  pBut when I call code[[UIDevice currentDevice] playInputClick]code, nothing happens whereas I can hear the click when I use the default keyboards.p  pIn the Apple UIKit framework reference, its written that it should work only if the input view is itself enabled and visible.

For example you might try 0.5x0.7. httpwww.chemie.fuberlin.dechemnetusesupplimagemagickwwwconvert.html   codepre  papparently the option is not supported anymore, Im interested if anyone knows if UCR is the solution Im looking for and if anyone knows if its supported or if Im supposed to use a different method to get the same result.p

Negative 12752 pIm struggling with coming up with the right way to capture audit information via a REST service.  Lets say Ive got an internal REST API for an Employee resource.  I want to capture things when an Employee is addedmodifiedremoved such as the user who did the change, the application the user was using, when it was done assume this could be asynchronous so the users action may have taken place at a different time than the REST call, etc.  Also, the user that initiated the change may not be the authenticated user making the REST call.p  pMy thoughts are that those properties do not belong in the body of the request  meaning that they are not attributes of the Employee object.  They are not something that would be retrieved and returned on a GET, so they shouldnt be in the POSTPUT.  They also do not belong as a parameter because parameters should be for specifying additional things about Employees or a searchfilter critiera on GET requests for Employees.p  pMy current thoughts are to have the client specify this information in the HTTP headers.  That keeps the URL parameters amp body pure for the Employee resource.  Is that an appropriate use of the headers  Are there other options that Im not seeingp

Negative 12752 pI have a directive for a input field that uses transclusion to take the elements that are enclosed in the directives element which includes an codengmodelcode attribute.  After reading countless SO questions and Angular documentation to find out how to get the codengmodelcode in the transcluded html to sync with the codengmodelcode in my directive I finally stumbled stumbled upon a trick to get it to work.  That is to use codeparentcode where the codengmodelcode is within the input field.  This is all fine and dandy, however, it seems clunkyhackish.  p  pPlunker shown here a hrefhttpplnkr.coeditgEje6Z2uuTs9DFPeCZfv relnofollowhttpplnkr.coeditgEje6Z2uuTs9DFPeCZfvap  pI tried to make this a little more elegant by messing around with the transclusion function within my link function like sop  pp  precode      var transcludedContent, transclusionScope        transcludeFnscope, functionclone, scope          headerCtrl.element.appendclone         transcludedContent  clone         transclusionScope  scope          console.logscope form , scope         console.logtransclude form , clone          codepre  pp  pAlso, shown in this Plunker a hrefhttpplnkr.coedit11k9LiA5hyi4xydWBo3Hppreview relnofollowhttpplnkr.coedit11k9LiA5hyi4xydWBo3Hppreviewap  pOne would think that the transclusion function would allow you to overwrite the transclusion scope with the scope of your directive then the codengmodelcode attributes would be associated and bound to the directives scope, however, this is not the case.  p  pAlthough, the codeparent.ltngmodelgtcode does work, it seems very hackish, and can lead to bugs like if my directive was not used with a parent scope that doesnt have an codeaccountcode object defined.  p

I was able to accomplish this by reformatting my data set so it now has a strain parameter or column and concatenated all of the y data. Now I can use the hue syntax with strain. I would like to not have to reformat all of my data sets. I thought that it may be possible to create a loop that would reference all the columns I want plotted, but I tried several syntaxes to no avail. There are other ways Ive thought of to accomplish this, but these create new datasets and I know is not the way to go programmatically. I am a new user and would like to start out correctly.p  pThis is what the output should look like subset of 15 graph panel shown I cannot post the image because my reputation is not high enoughp

Negative 12752 p.p  pI have a school project, recoding a stracelike command on a x8664 OpenSUSE. Intell i7p  pFor this purpose we are, of course, using ptrace system call but it is forbiden to use PTRACESYSCALL.

Negative 12752 pI am new to kernel coding and at present I am working with ELF files which have been modified a little bit for the security purposes for which I need to look at some of its custom section headers and extract the unique code encryption key from it for the CPU to decrypt the contents of the modified ELF.p  pAt present the above logic has been implemented within the codeloadelfbinarycode function in the codefsbinfmtelf.ccode file in the kernel source tree, however it is only about 250 lines of code change for which I need to recompile the whole kernel, so I am looking to improvise this functionality by implementing it as a loadable kernel moduleLKM so that every time an ELF is loaded it checks whether its the modified ELF or not and if it is then it extacts the key from the corresponding section.p  pEDIT To summarize it, I am looking at making a loadable kernel module to read through the sections of an ELF and fetch the contents of a custom section that contains the encryption key and related metadata and set those values in CPU registers.p

Negative 12752 pstrongSummarystrong I have a GridView with a TemplateField containing only an ASP.NET LinkButton.  My LinkButton looks like thisp  precodeltaspLinkButton IDlbDoc runatserver OnClientClickdocument.forms[0].target blank OnCommandProcessRequest Textlt EvalTitle.ToString gt CommandArgumentlt EvalID.ToString gt gt codepre  pNote the CommandArgument and the OnCommand property of the control.  Each button needs to perform some serverside processing, dependent upon the CommandArgument, and ultimately redirect and present a PDF in the new window. IMPORTANT I am not just linking to the PDF URL so I cannot use a HyperLink control or a simple anchor tag. The serverside processing is key and required.p  pstrongThe problemstrong  At runtime, once a user clicks on one of the LinkButtons, the PDF is loaded as desired in a new window, however all postbacks after that also load in a new browser tabwindow. Ive got DropDownLists with AutoPostback that requery and rebind my GridView  if the user selects different filter options in those DropDownLists after clicking on one of the LinkButtons, the results are posted back in a new browser tabwindow. strongThats the problemstrong  the user will end up with a mess of tabswindows. p  pstrongWhat Ive Triedstrong User PowIan described the same problem a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma18875066herea, but the proposed Javascript solution did not work for me. Ive tried a pure JavaScript solution like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq8042565046381thisa, but it also doesnt work. It will render the targetblank on the resulting  tag, but for some reason, it wont process the link in a new browser tab.p  pAny suggestions  p

Negative 12752 pstrongIntroductionstrongp  pI am working on an app with Rails 4 that functions as a simple dashboard, it iterates through several div containers sectioned off in quadrants on the home page that show various graphstables etc. I am using cookies to remember which index that the current displayed container is at so when the website reloads it displays the container that was being shown and not go back to the first one. p  pstrongThe Problemstrongp  pEverything seemed to be working ok until I started noticing that the cookies started changing by themselves and I have no idea how. I have come to this conclusion since I set and get the cookies using a function, which prints to the console whenever its being called. And nothing is being logged to the console when these rogue changes occur. p  pHeres the gist of how it works. The update function uses a helper function to get the cookie, calculates the next index depending on what the current index is, and then calls another helper function to store the cookie. The cookies are get and set only with those two functions.  p  precodevar updatequadrant  functionid    .whengetcookiecurrentfeed.donefunctionresponse        var currentindex  parseIntresponse       var nextindex  depends on currentindex      .whenstorecookiecurrentfeed, nextindex, from update.donefunctionresponse           code that updates quadrant            setTimeoutfunction  updatequadrantid, 30000        codepre  pHeres what some typical cookies would look like. p  precodecircleci gt 0, newrelic gt 1, googleanalytics gt 0 codepre  pstrongJavascriptstrongp  pStoring a cookie valuep  precodevar storecookie  functionfeed, value, other  return .ajax     url homecookiestore,     type POST,     data          feed feed,         value value,         other other            .donefunctionresponse      console.logresponse       codepre  pGetting the cookiep  precodevar getcookie  functionfeed      return .ajax         url homecookieget,         data              feed feed              .donefunctionresponse      console.logGot cookie value , parseIntresponse, for , feed       codepre  pstrongControllerstrong p  pResponding to ajax call to store cookie valuep  precodehome controller  def storecookie     feed  params[feed]     value  params[value]     other  params[other]     cookies[feed]  value.tos     render text stored value for feed, other other  end codepre  pResponding to ajax call for a cookie value.p  precodehome controller  def givecookie      feed  params[feed]     cookies[feed]  0 if cookies[feed].blank     render text cookies[feed.tos]  end codepre  pstrongWhat Ive tried to teststrongp  pI thought that maybe somehow the setTimeout function was persisting, and that multiple setTimeout timers were being executed but that doesnt change the fact that the emvalues were changing without anything being logged to the console from my storecookie function.em p  pFor example, I set an codesetIntervalcode that logs codedocument.cookiecode to the console every second. Heres what will display. p  precode Stored 0 for circleci, other from update quadrant  correctly changed with storecookie function as it logs the response from the controller circleci gt 0, newrelic gt 1, googleanalytics gt 0 ...no change ...no change ...no change circleci gt 1, newrelic gt 1, googleanalytics gt 0 but nothing printed to console from storecookie function  quadrant eventually goes to update after 30 seconds, and gets wrong cookie value Got cookie value 1 for circleci should be 0 not 1 codepre  pEven more baffling, when I go to click a link that uses a layout that doesnt include ANY javascript source files the cookie values are emstillem being changed. p  pI have been really struggling to get an idea of where to start debugging this since I have double and triple checked to make sure all cookie changes on the code side are changed with my storecookie function and Im seeing these cookie values being changed without anything being logged to the console, aka without the storecookie function being called.  p  pDoes anyone have an idea whats causing my cookie values to seemingly change by themselvesp

Im new to the whole MEAN stack, and from my research of the basics, I have gathered that with Node, you can make the http calls, parse the json response and then write it to the server, but it seems as if I would have to make an API to then be able to call it from Angular and display it how I wish. I know that with other backend languages like PHP, you can just write the code within the html, and not need a middle structure to get the info from PHP to the frontend.

Negative 12752 pIm trying to recreate a hrefhttpswww.windowsphone.comenusstoreappcanyouget1168012ffb54c441b5bb4736377fa2019d relnofollowthis gamea in JavaScript. For this game, I need cells with numbers in them. p  pI want the game to size to the available space in the browser. Ive managed to do this by using codevwcode and codevhcode in combination with codewidthcode and codeminwidthcode and height as you can see in the example. If you size the viewport in which the cells are shown, the cells size along.p  pstrongThe problemstrongp  pAnd now, I want the text in it to size along too. The container the cell resizes, and the font of the digit should size accordingly. I now used codevmaxcode as a unit, but this doesnt take the horizontal sizing into account. And since there is no codeminfontsizecode, I cannot do the same trick I used for the cells themselves.p  pstrongNo jQuery pleasestrongp  pIve tried and searched. Most notably, I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions687998autosizedynamictexttofillfixedsizecontainerAutosize dynamic text to fill fixed size containera, however I think my question is reversed. The text is fixed, and I could set an initial fontsize. I just need the font to scale along with the size of the element, so maybe this can be done through CSS after all.p  pBesides, most questions about this subject suggest using one of the various jQuery plugins and Im not looking for a jQuery solution. Im trying to make this game just for fun and practice, and Ive set a goal to create it without jQuery. Actually Im not even looking for a vanilla JavaScript solution. In the end it may boil down to that, but I havent tried building it myself yet, so I dont want to ask for JavaScript here now. No, Im looking for a pure CSS solution, if any.p  pstrongThe snippetstrongp  pThe dressed down snippet works best in full page mode. Nevermind the inline styling. These elements are actually generated by JavaScript and need be moved around. And sorry for the chunk of HTML.

The model normally spits out a bunch of information to a Windows console so that you can monitor its progress. In my case, I want the main Python script to run in one window  console, and then I want each model  simulation to spawn its own window  console so that each simulation can be monitored independently or indeed paused  stopped  terminated by simply closing the window.p  pWhen I run the Python script from within my editor Ive tried both Enthought Canopy and IDLE, the script works exactly as intended, with separate windows being spawned for each simulation. However, if I run the Python script by doubleclicking it in Windows explorer or calling it from the Windows command prompt, the individual simulations do not spawn their own windows. They all dump their output straight into the same window causing a confusing mess and also not allowing me to terminate simulations by closing its individual window.p  pTo resolve my problem, I have tried following all of the suggestions from the above links. This has included all sort of different combinations of using shellTrue, using the Windows start command, redirecting output pipes, etc. None of those solutions have worked for me.p  pI feel that I dont understand why my script works as intended from within Canopy  IDLE, but doesnt work when run directly from the command prompt.p  pMy script is as followsp  precodefrom time import sleep import threading from subprocess import call  def runmodelarg     callarg     sGlobal.release  if name  main          n  6  maximum number of simultaneous runs     s  15  delay between starts in seconds      simulations  []  big list of simulations to run in here  each item in list is another list containing the seperate arguments in the command line      threads  []     global sGlobal      sGlobal  threading.Semaphoren      for arg in simulations         sGlobal.acquire         t  threading.Threadtargetrunmodel, argsarg,         threads.appendt         t.start         sleeps      for t in threads         t.join codepre  pFor reference, the Windows command line to run a simulation would look like this there is a big list of these in my actual script  in the Python script each command is passed to subprocess.call as a list not a stringp  precodeltfull file path to model executablegt some flags here ltfull file path to model control filegt   codepre  pI would greatly appreciate any input that might help me better understand or resolve my problem here.p  pEDIT clarified that each command line is passed to subprocess.call as a list rather than a string. p  pEDIT 2 I now have working code thanks to  J.F.

Negative 12752 pI am writing an application for viewing and management of sensor data. I can have unlimited number of sensors, and each sensors makes one reading every minutes and records the values as strongtime, value, sensorid, locationid, [a bunch of other doubles].strongp  pAs an example, I might have 1000 sensors and collect data every minute for each one of them, which ends up generating 525,600,000 rows after a year. Multiple users say up to 20 can plot the data of any time period, zoom in and out in any range, and add annotations to the data of a sensor at a time. Users can also modify certain data points and I need to keep track of the raw data and modified one.p  pIm not sure how the database for application like this should look like Should it be just one table SensorData, with indices for time and sensorid and locationid Should I partition this single table based on sensorid should I save the data in files for each sensor each day say .csv files and load them into a temp table upon request How should I manage annotationsp  pI have not decided on a DBMS yet maybe MySQL or PostgreSQL. But my intention is to get an insight about data management in applications like this in general.p
Negative 12752 pWhile migrating some tests from JUnit to TestNG, Im facing an issue because of the difference in how these test frameworks treat their Test class instances.p  pJUnit creates a new instance of the Test class for each test method. So a common pattern I see isp  precodepublic class MyTest       private Stream inputData      Before     public void setUp           Set up some data in nonstatic instance fields          This data is isolated per test         inputData  createInputDataStream           Test     public void testStuff           Use the data from the instance fields         doStuffinputData           After     public void tearDown           Clean up the data from the instance fields         closeInputDataStreaminputData       codepre  pIn contrast, TestNG uses a single instance of the Test class for all test methods. So the pattern above does not work Because data is stored in instance fields, the values are no longer isolated. This can cause overwritten data midtest if parallel execution is enabled.p  pSo how would I do this with TestNG Is there a way to store data which is isolated to each codeBeforeMethodcodecodeTestcodecodeAfterMethodcode tuplep  pI can do all 3 steps inside the codeTestcode itself, but that would require adding ungainly codetry...finallycode blocks to every test. I also tried using codeITestContextcode, but it also seems to be shared for the entire test run.p

Negative 12752 pThis is a tricky question to make you understand but let me attempt it.p  pToday, I have 8 different portlets in my page and when global search box is triggered I fire 8 GSA queries to show each result set onto the respective portlet.p  pThe difference between each of the GSA call are the collection namesp  pNow I could not manage to think of a solution to replace 8 different GSA calls with one call.p  pEach collection has atleast 100k documents and the max result a GSA search response can give is only 1000 and 100 per requestcall. So it is quite impossible for me to parse the entire XML set and programmatically group them.p  pI know it is a poor design to show 8 different portlets with 8 different queries so Im not looking for help from that angle. The design is robust is an assumption. Could you think of anything creative to address this logic Thank you very much in advance and thank you for reading my question.p

I am developing an alarm system which will show fail whenever the strain readings jump outside these linear slopes. What I am asking is if there is any other way of statistically producing upper and lower bound curves outside of normal distribution confidence levels, as my methods will sound an alarm all to oftenp

If i log in to the site i go to codewww.thewebsiteoftheshop.combasketusernameuser1amppasswordtestcodep  pthen the user can see the password in the url,p  pthe first problem is I have a database where is store the username and password which i will later put with variables in the url for username and password.

But the only problem is that if i put the password not hashed but as a normal string in my database, that maybe someone from outside can get the password. So this will be risky.p

Negative 12752 pI am trying to solve a strange mouse issue here in Excel 2010 VBA in which I have two modeless forms running and cannot seem to get to work properly. When my code opens the form,  I have it runp  precodeUserForm1.Show vbModeless Do While continueplease  False     DoEvents Loop codepre  pOn the form itself there is a button which sets continueplease to be True. The issue is that mouse control during this period is almost completely nonfunctional. What I mean is that if I click on the spreadsheet, it seems as though the mouse is not properly aligned with the cells on which I am clicking. i.e if I click on cell C5, excel will select something like cell C10. The issue seems to also be across the horizontal axis as well. Additionally I cannot changeadd sheets, or have any keyboard function either.p
