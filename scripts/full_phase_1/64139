So we are testing the idea of create multiple projects inside a single solution and have each module be its own project rather then having a single very large project.p  pI created a test solution with two projects strongAstrong and strongBstrong, next I added each project as a reference to the other project, when adding one project as a reference to the other, I right clicked on emReferenceememAdd ReferenceemBrowsed to the other projects embinDebugem folder and added the other projects em.exeem as the reference. Next, using the other project as a namespace I was able to do things like form inheritance and opening forms or calling methods between my two test projects.p  pBut I accidently clicked emClean Solutionem which cleaned the binDebug folder for my two projects, and all of my references between the two projects were broken.p  pWhat is a proper and reliable way to add permanently references between projects inside a single solution I was thinking I could physically copy each projects .exe into the other projects bin, then add it as a reference. But that means Ill have to manually recopy it every time the other project gets updated.p

Negative 64139 pIve been using the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarycc467894.aspxMicrosoft Enterprise Librarya since before it was labeled as such for abstracted data access, in place of writing my own DAL. Originally I was just importing one file sqlhelper.cs into my projects, but then the later releases required that I reference the whole dll, unless I wanted to put a good deal of work in removing the functionality I wanted.p  pI assume a new version of Enterprise Library will be released a few months after .NET 4.0 is released. My companys usage of the library is likely different from the traditional use, we design and develop web and windows applications for a number of clients. We either hand off the finished projects to internal developers to maintain, or if it is a smaller client, well maintain the applications. p  pBecause of the nature of the business, Im fortunate enough to start from scratch a good deal of time when designing a new application, opposed to being tied to updating the same codebase. The next project I will likely ask the same question of myself, should we use the Microsoft Enterprise Library again We only use the Data Access Blocks, and it does seem save time during development. At the same time, I wonder how much overhead and complexity Im adding to the project by using the objects.p  pThank you in advance for your suggestions.p  h2Updateh2  pThe discussion here really has me reconsidering the issue  it might be less about  lightweight abstractions for accessing Stored Procs, but a larger architectural question on why were still tied to the NTier model. p  pTo me if comes down to what a database is used for in the application. In the classic 3TierNTier world, the database is an independent storage of company information. Different applications Web, Desktop, etc. all share and access a common storage platform. In this scenario, stored procedures make sense because they act as a layer of abstraction between the various applications and the tables. p  pFor other projects, the database is the exclusive persistent storage of the larger application. The UI or other types of access including Web Services, Remoting, etc. are required to gothrough the BLL of the application. This is the scenario we more commonly develop for, because of the nature of our business.p  pGiven this conclusion, Im going to create two prototype projects, one using SubSonic and the other LINQ. Although Im concerned about the overhead and loss of fidelity with LINQ, the significant reduction of code needed for data access and the alignment to the type of projects we develop, make it worth a look.p

Negative 64139 pOk. I have never seen anything like this before and I am quite confused... On a website I am working on, there are two JavaScript includes. Well, many more, but the problem occurs with only two. Well call these codeA.jscode and codeB.jscode.p  pcodeA.jscode defines a JavaScript singleton codeAcode. Likewise codeB.jscode defines a JavaScript singleton codeBcode. The codeBcode class depends on methods from codeAcode.p  pI have almost all my code wrapped up in codetry  ...  catch  ... code blocks, and on error, the system generates an AJAX request to email me the details of the error.p  pOn one system here in my office Firefox 3.0 for Mac I am seeing the strangest behavior. Once in a while, maybe once every hour or two, but with no specific pattern, I get an error email from class codeBcode codeReferenceError A is undefined.codep  pI have no idea whyhow codeAcode would be undefined emsometimesem. When I look in the apache logs, during the times I receive the error, the client is requesting codeA.jscode, before requesting codeB.jscode, and the server is responding with a code304code Not Modifiedp  pI somehow suspect the issue is that the file has expired from the client cache however the server doesnt send the file thus it is never executed and codeAcode is undefined. But thats just a guess and I dont understand why that would happen. And if I am guessing right, how do I fix itp  pIf it matters, codemoddiskcachecode was enabled on the server, and I have disabled it to see if that was causing the problem. If so, maybe this belongs on ServerFault...p  pAny suggestions very welcomep

Negative 64139 pI am trying to reproduce the behavior of a spreadsheet cell using GWT. I was able to make a Composite widget called Cell which is by default a Label widget. When a user clicks on this widget, it becomes a TextBox widget. On a blur event, the widget becomes a Label widget once again.p  pMy question concerns efficiency and rendering time. It would probably be easiest to just make my Cell a TextBox and just change the appearance to the user via CSS according to whether they are entering data or not. However, I think that this will affect rendering time and so I revert to a Label widget whenever input is not necessary. The problem with this method, however, is that I am basically creating a new TextBoxLabel each time the user needs to enter anything into the Cell.p  pHere is my pseudocode since I am not around an IDE...p  precodepublic class Cell extends Composite   private SimplePanel sp  public Cell      Label l  new Label     sp.addl   private void switchMode      Widget w  sp.getWidget     if w instanceof Label           we have a Label, change it to a TextBox         String text  Label w.getText         sp.removew         sp.addnew TextBoxtext          force garbage collection         w  null      else           we have a TextBox, change it to a Label         String text  TextBox w.getText         sp.removew         sp.addnew Labeltext          force garbage collection         w  null        ... codepre  pWhen there is a onBlurEvent on the TextBox or when there is an onClick event on the Label, the switchMode method is called. Critiquing of code is welcomed.p  pWould it instead be smarter to include a TextBox and Label as private variables of the Cell class, and then just add or remove the corresponding object as neededp

Negative 64139 pIve noticed some seemingly weird issues in Visual Studio 2008 .NET 3.5 and also in Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 .NET 4.0.  These issues may have existed in prior versions as well.  Maybe they are not an issue, but either way, I would like to see if there is are logical explanations for these before I submit a report on Microsoft Connect.p  pThe Setup in VB, C results differ and are included later in the postp  precodePublic Class SomeClass     Public Property SomeProperty As String         Get             Return String.Empty         End Get         SetByVal value As String         End Set     End Property End Class  Public Class SomeOtherClass     Public Sub New         Dim sc As New SomeClass         Me.SomeFunctionsc.SomeProperty     End Sub       ltsummarygtThe param as Object fnltsummarygt      Public Sub SomeFunctionByVal param As Object     End Sub       ltsummarygtThe param as T fnltsummarygt      Public Sub SomeFunctionOf TByRef param As T     End Sub End Class codepre  pIn this sutation, the codeMe.SomeFunctionsc.SomePropertycode call, from the point of view of IntelliSense, looks like thisbr img srchttpdl.dropbox.comu215878nonprivatevb.png altalt textbr and, not surprisingly, this is also what is called at runtime.p  pSo, I guess the strongfirst questionstrong I have is, emwhy was the ByRef templated overload version of the function chosen over the ByVal Object overload version of the functionem  My guess is that the compiler and IntelliSense simply favor the templated versions over nontemplated versions.  At runtime, it is in fact the ByRef templated version of the function that is called.  This is not the defect, this is simply a personal wanttoknow question.p  pNow, make a slight change to the codeSomePropertycode property such that the setter is now privatep  precodePublic Property SomeProperty As String     Get         Return String.Empty     End Get     Private SetByVal value As String     End Set End Property codepre  pAs soon as you do this, the following happens to the codeMe.SomeFunctionsc.SomePropertycode linebr img srchttpdl.dropbox.comu215878privatevbeh.png altalt textp  pIn this case, IntelliSense is suggesting that the ByVal Object overload version of the function is being called, however the error message is codethe Set accessor of property SomeProperty is not accessiblecode indicating that the compiler is still expecting to call the ByRef templated version.  So, this is my strongsecond questionstrong.  emWhy is Intellisense claiming one thing while the VB compiler is clearly trying something elseem  This seems broken to me.  Or am I missing somethingp  pIf instead of having a private setter on codeSomePropertycode but instead the property was simply marked ReadOnly and the setter part removed, then the ByRef templated version of the function is shown in IntelliSense and is called at runtime with no runtime errors.  So this leads me to my strongthird questionstrong, emwhy is the VB compiler treating the input to ByRef params different for properties that are ReadOnly vs notReadOnly, but have an outofscope setter in VBem  As far as SomeFunctionOf T... is concerned, in its current scope, that property should be as if it were ReadOnly and I would expect it to be callable just as if the property was in fact ReadOnly.  But instead it produces a build error.p  pIn correlation with question three, doing the emexact same setupem with the Private setter, C has the result I was expecting.  img srchttpdl.dropbox.comu215878privatecsharpeh.png altalt textbr Here, you can see IntelliSense is claiming that the SomeFunctionObject overload of the function is being called and there is no build error.  At runtime the SomeFunctionObject version is in fact called.  So, why isnt the same SomeFunctionObject version being called in the VB.NET situation  Why does VB.NET still think the SomeFunctionOf TByRef T version need to be called  It looks like IntelliSense is nailing it correctly in both C and VB.NET, the C compiler is doing the right thing, but the VB.NET compiler is still convinced that it should be calling the ByRef templated version.  To me it seems that the C compiler is picking one overload, while the VB.NET compiler is picking a different overload, in the exact same situation.  Am I wrongp

Negative 64139 pToday my question is about UITableViewControllers In particular I have noticed that the datasource delegate method p  precode NSIntegernumberOfSectionsInTableViewUITableView tableView codepre  pis called twice even if for instance I just create a navigation based application and without adding a line of code.. well adding an NSLog to track it. Now, since in my application I need to determine the number of sections basing the choice on the documents in the file system, I need to call some methods to do so. I have put these methods in the above mentioned method, so they will be called twice, which is something I dont need. The questions are why is it called twice, can I have it called once I hope that in the official documentation this is not clearly stated which would mean that I didnt read it at all  . By the way I could see others posting similar questions, but I couldnt find a fully satisfying answer. Thank you.p

Negative 64139 pI have the following scenariop  pA codeWCFcode service solution that contains a service implementation layer, business layer and data layer.  The codeWCFcode implementation layer depends on the business layer and the business layer on the data layer.  Each layer receives its dependencies via constructor injection.  Weve wired this all together using Unity.  We have a custom codeWCFcode service hostfactorbehaviorinstance provider that calls into our Unity container to resolve the codeWCFcode service to use and its various dependencies. p  pIts working great...almost.p  pWere using codeEntityFrameworkcode code first in our data layer.  What were seeing is that a new DbContext class is created on the initial call into codeWCFcode, but that class is reused on subsequent calls into the service.  This becomes a problem of course when our service is serving multiple calls that are accessing the database concurrently.  I was able to prove out that the codeDbContextcode class is in fact being reused by placing some trace statements in the DbContext class constructor.  I went further up the chain and places similar trace statements in the business layer implementation constructor and found that this is also only being called once.  In fact, it appears that only the codeWCFcode service implementation is being constructed on each service call and that the data and business layers are behaving as singletons.p  pFrom what Ive read, it sounds like the default behavior when using codeRegisterTypecode with Unity is to use the codeTransientLifetimeManagercode and that this implies a new instance will be created on every call to codeResolvecode.  Since it didnt appear that this default behavior was working correctly, we tried explicitly setting the lifetime manager as codeTransientLifetimeManagercode, however were still seeing our business and data layers behaving as singletons.  p  pAny ideas on what I need to do to get our codeWCFcode dependencies to behave as singletonsp  pstrongUpdatestrong Still no success.  I tried using the PerResolveLifetimeManager, however that did not solve the problem.  As a temporary work around, I refactored my code so that its injecting a factory into my data layer.  The factory provides DbContext instances, so Im able to ensure that each call into my data layer is using a new DbContext.  This is working ok for now, but Id like to resolve whatever issue is causing Unity to hold onto and reuse instances after theyre created.p

Negative 64139 pAs a project I have been working on has grown, so has the frequency of situations where all scripts on a page are not available when other code tries to access them. Though this happens most often after code is updated e.g. not cached Ive had it come up more and more in testing, when it never used to happen.p  pIve addressed this, partially, by using a function to wait for a module to become available see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5316666watchforapropertycreationeventthis questiona and this addresses the concern, mostly, but Im not totally thrilled with the implementation, and am looking for a more industrial strength pattern to deal with this. These are possible solutions Ive come up withp  p1 strongLoad scripts on demandstrong with something like a hrefhttpensure.codeplex.com relnofollowensurea  not ideal. Requires actual script name dependency information to be included in each script, not just moduleobject name, to do this. Still have to take some action before using a resource to ensure its available.p  p2 strongManage script loading orderstrong. If this would even work e.g. I dont think that simply putting script A before script B guarantees it will be available since they can be loaded concurrently, it would be a pain, since you dont know a dependency until youve loaded the thing that depends on it. Would require a lot of work to set up on a site that has lots of pages that use different resources and I have no intention of loading everything used everywhere on the site on every page.p  p3 strongWait for everythingstrong to be loaded on a given page before allowing user interaction. Far from ideal for obvious reasons. Still doesnt address dependencies that happen in initialization code.p  p4 strongExpand upon my current solution.strong Currently works like this is pseudocode, but the basic logic processp  precode Depends on Module2 Module1  function      self       function requires dependency     waitFor waits until global named dependency is available then calls callback    self.initializedfalse     self.init  function         waitForModule2, function             self.intializedtrue                waitForInitialization sets a callback when self.initializedtrue    self.func  self.waitForInitializationfunc             Module2.doStuff                UIinitiated function requires dependency    self.uiFunc  function         if self.initialized            showPleaseWaitDialog           self.waitForInitializationfunction                dismissPleaseWaitDialog               self.uiFuncImpl         else            self.uiFuncImpl                self.uiFuncImpl function          Module2.doStuff       codepre  pI can think of ways to create a prototype that would deal with the dependency issue more transparently than my code above, and fully intend to do that if I have to, but is this truly the best solution What do others do What are considered best practicesp

I have run a describeSObjectsnew string[]Profile and I have found the DescribeSObjectResult has a creatable  False.  Is there a way to use the API to create new Profile objects or am I stuck using the SalesForce.com Administration Setup UIp

Negative 64139 pIm requesting stuff from the web using web services that return XML. This works fine as long as the device is not locked. If the user turns the device off or if it gets locked after the configured timeout, the webservice fails. I appended the stacktrace here. What Im wondering Im not doing anything in my test application with the result of the webservice called via SOAP. Still it crashes, trying to call mprotect or something. What is the issue and how can I keep my app running if the device gets locked I always thought locking is different from pushing to background  the app should remain active.p  pI found out that errno 12 means out of memory but that is not true. If the device does not lock, the test app goes on for hours. As soon as it locks, it does one more request and crashes. Also Instruments shows a constant memory usage of 40MB Like in Lukes question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5389947explanationofmprotecterrno12enomemExplanation of MProtect Errno 12 ENOMEMa p

Negative 64139 pI was searching for a solution of the following problem, so far without success Im planning a RESTful web service, where certain actions e.g. DELETE should require a special authentication.p  pThe idea is, that users have a normal usernamepassword login session based or Basic Auth, doesnt really matter here using which they can access the service. Some actions require an additional authentication in form of a PIN code or maybe even a onetime password. Including the extra piece of authentication into the login process is not possible and would miss the point of the whole exercise.p  pI thought about special headers something like XOTPAuthetication but that would make it impossible to access the service via a standard HTML page no means to include a custom header into a link. Another option was HTTP query parameters, but that seems to be discouraged, especially for DELETE.p  pAny ideas how to tackle this problemp

Negative 64139 pIm using Entity Framework to SQL Azure and in one page of my application we show quite a bit of related data to the user. Were loading a max of 30 items on the page but each item has 5 onetomany mappings to other objects. The query time is at a reasonable level but Im leaking quite a bit of performance on the object mapping. almost a full second. p  pHeres an example of what my object looks likep  precodepublic class Task      public string Name get set     public string Status get set     public DateTime DueDate get set     public IEnumerableltTaskDatagt Data get set     public IEnumerableltTransactiongt Transactions get set     public IEnumerableltFilegt Files get set     public IEnumerableltCommentgt Comments get set     public IEnumerableltPeoplegt People get set  codepre  pA task has a name, a status and a due date. It also has strongmanystrong TaskData that are custom namevalue pairs, strongmanystrong Transactions that show a history of the task, strongmanystrong Files, strongmanystrong Comments and strongmanystrong People working on it. p  pMy EF query looks something like this. p  precodevar Items  context.Items.Includexgtx.Data.Includexgtx.Files.Includexgtx.Comments.Includexgtx.People.Wheresome constraint.ToList codepre  pThe relevance of a specific task is based first on the status, and then on the due date. So Ive created an IComparable override to use with sort. The point is that paged queries dont work well in this scenario because the sort isnt based off of an int or a date am I rightp  pIn the rest of our application were displaying less information about each task and Linq2Entities is working just fine. The object mapping in this case is killing us though. Ive gone down the road of going straight to the DB with Dapper but onetomany mapping has its caveats. For a few relationships I think it would work well but not for 56. My next thing to look at was PetaPoco but I didnt get very far before I thought Id better throw the question on here first. p  pAm I crazy for trying to bring back so much data What are my options for getting maximum performance out of this Ill take a little bit of complexity since its only one area of the application. p

Negative 64139 pI am embarking on a programming project that will need to confirm device identity of removable media e.g. usb thumb drives before it will go on to do a bunch of other cool stuff.  p  pSome friends of mine pointed me towards using the Serial Number, and preliminary testing using the udevadm command indicates that this should work.  I did some additional checking and it appears that if I can get the software working with libudev then it should minimally compile on ubuntu, slackware and gentoo, which would be a really nice benefit.  p  pSo I used bing to find a tutorial and got the Signal 11 site httpwww.signal11.usossudev its a very wellwritten tutorial.  It actually seems to have everything I need.  I download the code.  Fix a couple of platformspecific bugs and then compile.  BOOM  Gcc compiles without errors.  So far so good.p  pBut when I try to run it, it kicks up a couple of bugs, and I realize that I need to read some more tutorials so that I can understand libudev well enough to fix the bugs, and to turn out working software.  Problem is that there really ISNT any other tutorials that I can find and the kernel.org site that is the only known site of the library documentation is down after a recent server compromise.p  pI considered just issuing udevadm directives to system and then parsing results, but thats a really hackish way to put software together, and I am planning on releasing this to the community when Im finished writing.p  pSo how best for me to learn libudevp

I was wondering whether there is a way to specify a build configuration which would be common for all the projects deployed on Jenkins.p  pFor instance, I want all the projects to generate JavaDocs hence I require the i mavenjavadocplugin i in maven pom. As I understand, this cant be added to the bsettings.xmlb file. And I dont have access to the super pom.

Negative 64139 pIm new to CakePHP, though not new at all to MVC frameworks for web development. Id normally go with Drupal when doing web sites that are not web apps but my employee feels that coding stuff from the ground up is far better than using pre built well tested and working solutions. Sigh.p  pAnyways, he agreed to at least let me use a framework, and I chose CakePHP because a Ive always wanted to learn it, and b I love Rails so much I cant honestly go back to Zend once more  Whatever, I decided to have some Cake so bear with me p  pI set up a whole lot of controllers and stuff implementing all the features of the site, and now Id need to set up Drupallike url aliases. Such an alias is something that lets you request a hrefhttpwww.example.comthisbemepage relnofollowhttpwww.example.comthisbemepagea and display the same page that youd have seen if you requested a hrefhttpwww.example.compages42 relnofollowhttpwww.example.compages42a for example. Or return the same as article301 when you type blogthemostexcellentpostever  I guess you got how it works.p  pI set up a database and a model such that I can query for the alias and retrieve the internal url, then Im stuck. It seemed that callingp  precodehtml  thisgtrequestActioninternalurl, arrayreturn codepre  pwould have returned the fully rendered HTML as if my user directly requested internalurl but its not the case. I only get the HTML for the actions view, without all the awesome layout stuff.p  pIm going this databasecontroller way because Id like sites admins to be able to edit the aliases via browser, not by editing some obscure routing directives or the .htacces. Its also much quicker to log in, create a page, set the alias and go out for lunch.p  pNow how do I do itp  pstrongEDITstrong Mimicking the behaviour of appwebrootindex.php I wrote this action for my AliasControllerp  precodepublic function parse      alias  thisgtrequestgtparams[url]      record  thisgtAliasgtfindByAliasalias     request  record[Alias][request]      Dispatcher  new Dispatcher     Dispatchergtdispatchnew CakeRequestrequest, new CakeResponsearraycharset gt ConfigurereadApp.encoding      die  codepre  pExcept for the name it doesnt really parse anything, does it it works fine at least it does what I wanted it to do.

Negative 64139 pIve got JQuery running and Id like to use a scrollTop animation to move the window back near the top about 240px, though somewhat variable as the callback of an AJAX call that will replace a large chunk of HTML content on the page.p  pIm usingp  precodehtml, body.animate scrollTop someNumericalVariable  codepre  pThe problem I run into is that, when this code runs with no delay or timeout, the window will do a very small scrolling animation to a location that is nowhere near desired. When I add a some arbitrary delay at least 1 to a few seconds, the window may or may not end up in the desired location, but the animation is hardly an animation it acts more like 2 separate scrollTop calls  it will quickly jump upward, wait a second, then jump upward again to the correct spot.p  pWhen I run the code separately not as the callback in the middle of a bunch of HTML rendering, the animation seems to work properly.p  pAny ideas Thanks in advance.p
Negative 64139 pI have a problem understanding some code fragment from Matlab Signal processing Toolbox fir2 functionp  precode My comment at this point vector H contains nn1 nn is an even number points double numbers of amplitudes for a dense frequency grid    Fourier timeshift. dt  0.5 . nn  1 rad  dt . sqrt1 . pi . 0npt1 . npt1 H  H . exprad My comment now H contains nn1 complex numbers    My comment creates a horizontal mirror with 2nn points     Hconj  [H conjHnpt112]    Fourier transform of real series. ht  realifftHconj             Symmetric real series.  My comment throws away the half after ht[nn] b  ht1nn          Raw numerator. wind  hammingnn b  b . wind.    Apply window. codepre  pWhat confuses me is  if I comment out that Fourier timeshift, the result of ifft is symmetrical around ht[nn]  if I leave Fourier time shift code intact, the result of ifft is no longer symmetrical around ht[nn] but it has two symmetrical groups around ht[nn2] and ht[3nn4], while both parts around ht[nn] look really different in a plot. But everything after ht[nn] is thrown away, so if I need the final output to be symmetrical, I have to leave that Fourier time shift.p  pWhy is that Fourier time shift needed Can I replace it with some simpler algorithm in my C application which is not using complex numbers and still get out nn points with symmetry around ht[nn2] so I can throw away everything after ht[nn]p  pP.S. I just looked at the plots with and without Fourier timeshift and noticed that I can get the same result by shifting the second result nn2 to the right. So theoretically I could avoid using Fourier time shift in my C application but just shift the real results of ifft by nn2 to the right and then throw away everything after nn. Am I right Is it safe to do  p

Negative 64139 pPart of this question is Im not even sure what exactly Ill need to ask, so Ill start with the situation and work out from there.p  pOne project Im working on involves use of COMET via the aspComet library. The use case of the program is somewhat of a collaborative slideshow. One person runs the bulk of it, with one or more participants able to perform certain actions. Low latency between when an action is performed on screen p  pPreviously, it was just running on one server. Now, were wanting to scale it out a bit, more for reliability than performance reasons. So, we have some boxes out in Rackspaces cloud and all that fun stuff.p  pI knew from the start of this that I was going to need to make some changes to the way the COMET stuff works since different people in the same show might be on different servers, and I have no way of knowing what show they belong to until after they have already arrived on the site.p  pI initially tackled this using the WCF Mesh provider, which wasnt well documented to start with, now Im running into issues with dispatching messages to it sometimes get lost, or delayed Im not 100 sure what is going on there, but it screws up the long poll for COMET and breaks things in rather strange ways Clicking a button may trigger an event, or itll hang for 10 seconds long poll duration and not actually do anything.p  pMore research leads me to believe one of the .Net service bus providers may do what I need. However, I cant find examples that would cover what I needp  ol liNo single point of failure outside of a databaseli liNo hardcoding of peers.li liNearrealtime no polling, event based would be bestli ol  pMy ideal solution would involve that when a server comes up, it lets other servers know of its existence Even if its just a row in a table somewhere, and they can start sending broadcast messages among each other, with each server being both a publisher and subscriber. This is what I somewhat had in the WCF Mesh provider, but Im not overly confident in that code.p  pCan anyone point me in the right direction with this Even proper terms to look for in the docs for service bus providers would be good at this point. Or are service buses not what I want At this point I would settle for setting up a Jabber server on each web server and use that, if it could fit within my constraints.p

Negative 64139 pIve got a bunch of javascript working on this page so that users can fill the form which includes a file upload field. They can add these forms to a queue which is just a series of iframes with the forms data moved into it. With the click of a button it will go through each form and submit them one at a time. When each form is submitted I load a gif to show that there is action. When the processing page is finished it will spit some jquery back at the iframe and give a success or error message. This works great so long as the files are not too large. It seems that the larger files near 1GB results in a condition where the jquery from the processing page never shows up in the iframe. This is disastrous because the submitting page will not continue to submit forms unless it gets some sort of response. Also the user is left with a spinning image that never goes away, and are unsure if even one large file has actually uploaded. Ive tried setting the maxexecutiontime and maxinputtime for an hour, but this doesnt help at all. Currently using a jqueryjavascript to loop through each form and submit it. Can anyone tell me why this is happening andor how to resolve this issuep

Negative 64139 pI generally dont like asking whats wrong with my code questions, but this is my last hope.p  pIm doing a project in which I have to write to files, and Im trying to do it using system calls Linux. So Im using codeunistd.hcode, which provides the functions codeint open char filename, int flags, int mode code and codeint write int fd, void ptr, int numbytes code.

Negative 64139 pI am developing an identity card management application in Java that will replace a decadesold obsolete mainframe system. The required functionalities include printing personal data on cards that are fed by a dot matrix printer. The page size of each card is 3.5 height  8.5 width.p  pTo illustrate my problem, the program below creates a twopage sample printout with some data.p  ul liI use PDFCreator as a printer, but I figured out that the behaviour is exactly the same with a dot matrix printer, so it can be tested by anyone reading this post.li liThe page size and layout are correct, but the pages are rotated 90 so that they are fed vertically.li liOn a laser printer, this would cause no problem since one would feed the sheets vertically as well like Com10 envelopes, for example. But this not acceptable with fanfold paper on a dot matrix printer.li liBy the way, this fanfold paper has a preprinted template, so no rotations are possible whatsoever.li liRegardless of any page orientation option I use i.e. putting an OrientationRequested parameter in a PrintRequestAttributeSet, it seems impossible to get the printout not to be rotated, i.e. to keep the 3.5  8.5 pages in their original horizontal orientation.li liWhen running the program below, the only way I succeeded consists to edit the printer advanced properties, selected a custom PostScript format, set its size to the aforementioned size, and MANDATORY set the paper feed direction to Short Edge First.

Negative 64139 pI am following Mark Storys a hrefhttpmarkstory.compostsviewtestingcakephpcontrollersmockobjectsedition relnofollowTesting CakePHP controllers  Mock Objects editiona to test some controller actions that have redirects. I am currently mocking out the redirect method in simple test. I wanted to refactor some code to look as followsp  precodeif thisgtModelgtsomeGuardConditionid   thisgtredirectthisgtreferer   if thisgtModelgtsavethisgtdata   thisgtredirectarraycontroller gt controllerName, action gt actionName, id  codepre  pThe problem is that if the first condition is true then I do not want the test to ever execute the second condition as this is how it would work in production. Is there a way to cause the test to end whenever redirect is called without killing the entire test suite I know I could put a return statement after every redirect but I would rather not modify the code just to get the tests to behave correctly. Should I just stick to using a bunch of ugly nested ifelse statementsp  pemEDIT 20120215em I will try make my example code more complete to demonstrate the problemp  psomecontroller.phpp  precodeclass SomeController extends AppController   function someactionid      if thisgtModelgthasAuthorityToDoThisid       thisgtSessiongtsetFlashThe id is invalid for some reason       thisgtredirectthisgtreferer          if thisgtModelgtsavethisgtdata       thisgtSessiongtsetFlashSave successful       thisgtredirectarraycontroller gt controllerName, action gt actionName, id         codepre  psomecontrollertest.phpp  precodeclass SomeControllerTestCase extends AppCakeTestCase    function testSomeAction      thisgtSomeControllergtSession  new MockSessionComponent     thisgtSomeControllergtSessiongtexpectOncesetFlash     thisgtSomeControllergtsomeactionsomeinvalidid   Note this is an invalid ID.      codepre  pSo you can see from above, I am testing the action with an invalid ID. This means the first condition will pass. It will set the flash message as The id is invalid for some reason and redirect to the referer. In CakePHP redirect will exit the script when calling a redirect so the code would never actually make it to the modelsave. If I mock out redirect in test however, the method essentially just returns with no effect and the controller continues to run past the point it should. This is good in that it does not abort the test suite but it is bad because it does not actually reflect the bahavior of the actual code. p  pSay that the call to save thisdata is good. Then both the first and second conditions will pass. This will cause the test to fail because you should have a flash message set only once.p  pI am guessing there is no way to easily write code like this and it would be better to just stick with nested ifelse blocks. I was just trying to reduce cyclomatic complexity.p

For example Both Fried Chicken and Adobo needs Chicken and Oil but both of them having other ingredients.p  pExample I have the given ingredient of chicken and Oil. On that two ingredients given it would result to Fried Chicken bcoz fried chicken contains only this two ingredients. While there are some recipes having extra ingredient to be added on that two given ingredients in order for them to be complete. So the query must pull out ingredients from the database that would display in another query the result having the extra ingredient. p  pFor Example So Fried Chicken is already searched, and Adobo needs onion in order for it to be complete so onion is related to the two given ingredients bcoz of the recipe ADOBO not only that it will only display the recipes containing onion as extra ingredient. If garlic is the extra ingredient of another recipe it will display on another result showing recipes containing garlic as its extra ingredient. how would i do that Sorry for my bad english. i hope youll understand what i mean here. tnx. p

Here are the steps the php script checks if the POST[submit] is set, if it is set it check if the user input match data in the database, if inputs are correct it redirects users to a log in page. I am trying to stop users from accessing the page that the php script redirect them when their input are correct but I cant. I already try the empty and the isset function but they dont work. How does facebook manage to have users log in without redirecting them to other pages. When you log in facebook the url is a hrefhttpfacebook.com relnofollowhttpfacebook.coma.

Negative 64139 pI have a base class which has a blank list as a class attribute. Many child classes inherit from this base class. The intent is to use this list class attribute in conjunction with a class method in order to allow each child class to keep track of a certain set of its own instances. Each class is supposed to have a separate list which contains only its own instances.p  pWhen I made a naive implementation of this inheritance scheme, durring debugging I noticed that in fact every single child class was sharing the exact same list as a class attribute, and I was once again having Fun with the fact that python passes lists by reference. On closer inspection, it seems like every class attribute of the parent, methods and values alike, is simply passed by reference to every child, and that this doesnt change unless a particular attribute is explicitly overridden in the definition of the child.p  pWhat is the best way to reinitialize the class variables of a child upon its creation Ideally, Id like a way to ensure that every child starts with a cls.instances attribute that is a unique blank list which involves NO extra code in any of the children. Otherwise, what am I bothering with inheritance for in the first place dont answer thatp

Negative 64139 pI have implemented a downloader for iOS projects. It accepts requests and, when download has finished, responds to a target by a delegate. It is asynchronous and the target is obviously a weak reference so when the download is complete, if the target is no more allocated, Ive got a badacces. Ive resolved adding a method called when an object that use it is deallocated that search for the target in all requests and sets it to nil.  This is so far from the behavior I wanted completly independent from other objects if a download is no more requested it will be cached it has no method to stop the download but only a priority queue There is a safe way to know if a pointer still point to a valid memory addressp

Next, I used the strongadbstrong tool from Androids SDK on my host machine to connect to the virtual Android device successfully, using the following commandp  precodeadb connect 192.168.1.115 codepre  pNow, I can install APKs using adb, usingp  precodeadb install CpathtomyApp.apk codepre  pafter first exporting a signed APK in Eclipse Ive found that unsigned APKs wont install via adb, instead giving an error message about a certificate or something.p  pThis is fine and it works, but the process is extremely slow, since I have to go through the entire process of exporting in Eclipse, running the adb install command from my command line, and then finally switching to my virtual Android tablet and tapping on the application to run it.  My question is this strongIs there any easier way to configure Eclipse, such that I can buildinstallrun in one click or even two clicksstrong  I miss the simplicity of choosing Run as Android Application and having the application immediately pop up in the Android simulator, but the simulator otherwise is much worse for testing.p  pAlso note Ive read some guides that seem to claim that the device should appear inside of Eclipses AVD list, but all Im seeing there are my two simulator devices, not my VirtualBox Android installation, even though my host machine has used adb to connect to the device, and the device is showing up in the adb devices command as device not as offline or anything else that could be problematic.p

Negative 64139 pMy web apps UI is mostly built with the excellent Knockout.js. It is showing some layout errors in IE8 under IE7 compatibility mode. I have tried adding a meta tag to force standards mode like sop  pcodeltmeta httpequivXUACompatible contentIEedge gtcodep  pHowever, in IE9 under IE9 Compatibility View which I have to assume some users will have set this causes an error when Knockout does its bindingp  pDOM Exception INVALIDCHARACTERERR 5p  pIve found plenty of references to this error on the net  to do with the manner in which DOM elements are created  but obviously Im not controlling this, Knockout is.p  pWhat is a robust and minimally hacky way to force or encourage all present and future versions of IE to render in standards mode, which is also compatible with how Knockout.js builds the DOM Also, can anyone elaborate on exactly what Knockout.js is doing here which IE9 doesnt like Many thanks.p  pUPDATEp  pIve isolated at least one issue in my markup. I have a pair of radio buttonsp  precode        ltinput typeradio databindchecked Gender, attr  name gender  ID  valueintSex.Male gt         ltspangtMaleltspangt         ltinput typeradio databindchecked Gender, attr  name gender  ID  valueintSex.Female gt         ltspangtFemaleltspangt codepre  pThe name attribute of this pair of radio buttons is generated as gender plus the ID of the currently bound view model, as I have a deep hierarchy with multiple instances of this pair of radio buttons. Because I am generating the name attribute with Knockout, Im not specifying it against the input in the markup  and when I do also add a manual name such as joe, this binds correctly under Browser Mode IE9 Compatibility View. So its as if when in compatibility mode, the radio button is being deemed to be invalid by IE because it doesnt have a name attribute. But it works under Browser Mode IE9.p  pAlso this doesnt relate specifically to the IEedge meta tag, it will fail whenever I switch to Compatibility View regardless  but my next question is, why doesnt that meta tag override the browser settingp

Negative 64139 pCreating a mobile Dojo application and ran into the following issue. Ive searched here and elsewhere and have not seen anyone else having the issue. Im new to Dojo, so it may just be that Im doing something wrong.p  pstrongHeres the programmatic behaviorstrong  In the first panel div one, click the  button Div two is skipped and div three is transitioned into view Click Cancel and div two is skipped again and div one transitions back into view. This is all as it should be.p  pstrongHeres the problemstrong  When div one is transitioned back into view, a browser scrollbar appears and div three is still visible when you scroll to the bottom. This only happens once. Click  again, then Cancel again and div three is hidden as it should be and no scrollbar appears. In the HTML, if you switch divs two and three, the improper behavior does not occur. Unfortunately, that cannot be my solution, as the app will need to transition in any given order.p  pIn Chromes development tools, if you watch the HTML elements, youll notice that div threes visibility property doesnt return to hidden until you have clicked Cancel the second time.p  pMy guess is that it has something to do with the way Im programmatically creating the views.

Negative 64139 pI have a voting app built on PHP that takes Facebook logins uses PHP SDK. You need to connect with your Facebook account to vote. We decided to use Facebook logins to prevent vote frauds. p  pAfter logging in with the Facebook account, this is what happensp  ul liThe login page has the hidden variables userId, accessToken, name, email, gender, location, hometown, and link to the user profile  all of which are returned from the Facebook login.li liThe user chooses an option in the poll and then the app records his choice along with his identification details listed in the first point.li ul  pNow, here lies the problem. I can simulate an HTTP request with fake identification details and the app still thinks its a legitimate request and so, records the vote. So, someone can set up a script to generate random identification details, send them over HTTP requests ultimately leading to a lot of fraud votes.p  pMaybe, after the poll closes, we can test with the profile URLs to see whether the profiles exist or not but again, two issues herep  ul liThe intruder may use a list of valid user profile urls to create the fraud votes. If he does, we have no idea to find whether the vote was fraud or not.li liIsnt it a better idea to prevent fraud votes than sort out laterli ul  pSo, is there a way to allow only legitimate logins through the app Something like a test before recording the vote. p  pI guess, a CAPTCHA can help but that will interfere with a quick vote experience we want our users to have.p  pThank Youp

Negative 64139 pIve designed a WPF C application using Visual Studio 2012. The application, which is simple enough, runs fine on my strongWindows 8strong machine using the codeClickOncecode deployment method. The datagrid displays the content from a SQL Server database and performs all of its other functions just as Ive designed it to, but when I attempt to install it on a Windows 7 machine it immediately crashes and Im not sure why.br The Windows 7 computer Im trying to install the application on has .NET 4.5 running on it, but is there anything else that computer needs to have installed on it in order to run applications developed with VS 2012. brThis is my first attempt to install an application developed with VS 2012 on a Windows 7 machine, so Im not sure if theres another step that Im missing here. Any help you guys can provide would be greatly appreciated. brThank you.p
Negative 64139 pIm using TortoiseHg with the hggit Mercurial plugin to interact with Github without using Git at all, only Hg.  On Github, I forked the a hrefhttpsgithub.compydatapandas relnofollowpandas repoa.  I successfully cloned my fork to my computer.  I want to add the original pandas repo as a URL in Hg, so I can pull changes from that repo and integrate them with whatever changes I make myself.  I added the original pandas repo in the URLs in TortoiseHg under the name upstream.p  pHowever, if I try to pull from that original upstream repo, Hg hangs for a long time and then eventually issues a 504  Gateway timeout error.  If I directly clone the pandas repo instead of cloning my fork of it, I can pull from it fine.p  pThe strange thing is that this doesnt seem to happen with all repos.  I did the same process fork, clone the fork, then try to pull from the original with the a hrefhttpsgithub.commatplotlibmatplotlib relnofollowmatplotlib repoa, and it seems to pull from the original repo just fine.p  pEven stranger, if I clone the original repo, and then add my fork as an extra URL, I can pull from both.  So somehow the URL as set during the original clone is okay, but setting the same URL manually as a source doesnt work.p  pThis seems to indicate that the problem is with the pandas repo specifically.  Is this possible  Is there some setting on Github that could be affecting my ability to pull from that repo  What can I do to make it workp

Negative 64139 pI am creating a simple web application for a comic using HTML and JavaScript.

Negative 64139 pI have a lot of configuration data in EEPROM 4KB which I read out in packed structures.

Negative 64139 pIve been writing FORTRAN 95 programs which involve very large vectors. gfortran refuses to compile these programs or windows refuses to run them depending on how Ive declared the vectors because they are too large. p  pI would like to rewrite my programs so that in my new programs, instead of having one large vector with n elements, I have a set of corresponding vectors with nx elements each containing a subset of the elements of the large vector. The problem is that if I have say 100 of these smaller vectors and I call them vector1, vector2, vector3, ... vector100 then for any loop of my original programs which cycles through all of the elements of the large vector would be made much more complicated in the new programs because it would have to mention each of the 100 vectors vector1, vector2, vector3, ... vector100 explicitly. It would be convenient if I could reference one of the vectors, vectork, by using k as a variable so that I could reference one of them by concatenating vector with k in order to create the vector name. However, I gather this is not possible in FORTRAN. p  pAny advice would be appreciated.p

Negative 64139 pI have a wordpress shop site with the headway theme being used. I have tried all sorts of caching plugins to no avail, the only cache that works well is the headway theme cache which is built in. So i really want to use it.p  pThe problem is when the cache is turned on when the first visit to the website is http it immediately creates a cached css file. The very first line in that css is import urla hrefhttpfonts.googleapis.comcssfamilyLato relnofollowhttpfonts.googleapis.comcssfamilyLatoa which causes a ssl security warning.p  pIf i clear the cache and the first page i click is a https page i can see in the cached css file the 1st line is import urla hrefhttpsfonts.googleapis.comcssfamilyLato relnofollowhttpsfonts.googleapis.comcssfamilyLatoa and this causes no error, a happy certificate.p  pHeadway dont have an answer for me.p  pSo is there anything i can do with htaccess to force this line inside that css file to be seen as https or maybe use a php function in wordpress to check that line. Which would then enable me to be able to use the caching system.p  pIm sure there must be a way p

This is what I have done.p  psudo find dir type f exec chmod us   this is done in a python script using pexpect to supply the password. but I get the same issue when done via the command line.p  pif I then run ls l h gives the following I get the same output when this is done after a restartp  prwsrwxrwx 1 root root . . . filename.pyp  prwsrwxrwx 1 root root . . . filename.pyp  prwSrr 1 user user . . . filename.pycp  pSetting SUID in the session works however as soon as a reboot occurs the SUID bit is still there but seems to be ignored. Now I thought setting the SUID bit via chmod meant that the user ran the program with the elevated permissions of root and that chmodding was persistent through restarts. p  pMy question is is there a way to make a SUID bit survive a restart and not be ignoredp  pAny help on this would be greatp  pCheersp

Negative 64139 pI am writing the server component of an application that I am working on. I am using NIO to handle the networking, but I am struggling to figure out an efficient way to handle reading. The client application can send packets to the server that vary greatly in size. It could be a 100 byte text message, or a 500 kilobyte picture, and the server needs to be capable of handling those packets. Usually, I would create a buffer that is big enough to contain the largest possible packet, but in the case of this application, that would mean that I may have to have buffers emmegabytesem in size for each client, and that would devour memory. After a discussion with my friend, I have decided that I want to handle this a bit like how I would if I was using old IO. This means that I would allocate a new buffer for every packet, the buffer having the capacity exactly the length of the incoming packet. My packet structure is as followsp  p[int] [length]br [byte] [opcode]br [byte...] [payload]brp  pMy approach is to have two separate buffers one buffer with a capacity of 4 to read the length, and another buffer which will be constantly reinitialized with a different capacity  the length of the packet. Here is the code that I came up withp  precodeUser user  User selectionKey.attachment SocketChannel socketChannel  user.getSocketChannel ByteBuffer readBuffer  user.getReadBuffer ByteBuffer lengthBuffer  user.getLengthBuffer    Read as many packets as possible.   while true             Read the length if it has not been read yet.           if lengthBuffer.hasRemaining      socketChannel.readlengthBuffer            If the length could not be read, stop reading and wait for       more data to arrive.           if lengthBuffer.hasRemaining          break           else             Create a read buffer if one has not been created for the       incoming packet.           if readBuffer  null          lengthBuffer.flip         user.setReadBufferByteBuffer.allocatelengthBuffer             .getInt                 Attempt to read the packet.           socketChannel.readreadBuffer            If the packet was not completely read, then stop reading       altogether because all of the data has not been received yet.           if readBuffer.hasRemaining          break      else                     Otherwise, handle the data and prepare the buffers for           the next packet read.                   readBuffer.flip         user.handleData         user.setReadBuffernull         lengthBuffer.clear            codepre  pAnd there are a couple of problems that I see with this. For one, I sometimes get a NullPointerException on the line codesocketChannel.readreadBuffercode. Along with that, this solution does not seem clean. I feel that there is too much logic in the code and it seems problematic. Could anybody provide me with some modifications or my code or a different approach altogether Id appreciate it. Thanks.p  pOn a side note, could anyone post in the comments a nice way to paste code from Eclipse into here and format it properly I use the code button but the indentation is still incorrect, as you probably noticed.p

Negative 64139 pI have been searching for an answer to this everywhere, and I cant seem to find any simple solution for this. I cant understand why such a simple thing should be so complicated.p  pSo basically  what I want to do is to map up a few local sites on my apache, each of them having their own cssjs etc. Then in my apache conf I set up a few Aliasesp  precode site 1 Alias site1 Cwwwsite1 ltDirectory Cwwwsite1gt     Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI     AllowOverride All     Order allow,deny     Allow from all ltDirectorygt   site 2 Alias site1 Cwwwsite2 ltDirectory Cwwwsite2gt     Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI     AllowOverride All     Order allow,deny     Allow from all ltDirectorygt codepre  pNow, when I go to the url codehttplocalhostsite1code, the content for site1 will be served  index.html is being loaded. All fine. Within my files I am linking css and js from folders using absolute paths  for example codecssstyles.csscode and codejsscripts.jscode.p  pWhen these files are being served through apache they will get the following pathp  pcodehttplocalhostcssstyles.csscode ignoring the site1, and the reason is of course since Ive asked to go from my webroot localhost by specifying an absolute path.p  pWhy absolute paths I need to be able to move my .html files deeper into the folder structure of my sites  meaning that in relation to where they are  they cannot know where the resource files are  unless I can tell them to start from a certain point  the web root.p  pSo the question isp  pIsnt there any easy way of telling my Alias setup, that any file being asked for  using the absolute path, shoud start with codehttplocalhostsitexcode instead of just codehttplocalhostcode. In other words, the base path is changed.p  pIve tried AliasMatch, DirectoryMatch, RewriteRules RewriteBase, but all seemingly unable to change this.p  pMaybe I should be using something other than Aliasp
Negative 64139 pI m trying to search the content of a fairly large file 5gb using RandomAcessFile. Using binary search I divided the file into two parts , but such  a strategy would work only when I would be able to read the line where the randomacessfile pointer points from the start. Since there is no guarantee that the pointer will point to the start of the file I need a  way to position it to the start of the current line where it points. I referred the java docs but could not find a method that seeks the pointer to the start of the file. It does have a readLine function but that would read the next line.p

Negative 64139 pSo heres my problem, I used .removeAttr as a work around in disabling inline style, now theres an instance where I need restore the attribute that i had removed. Is it still possible or what can you suggest alternative solution i could use.p  pThe trigger for my removeAttr is media query from my browser. when the browser is being resize, the position of the element in the dom also change.

Negative 64139 pIm looking at the AWS API and I cant seem to find a method to help me get info on an existing RDS database.

Negative 64139 pI am trying to process an input character when given, clear the box, and be ready to process another.p  pThe app uses an EditBox which always has a max of 1 character.  When the user enters a new character, a listener will fire.  The afterTextChanged method of that listener a TextWatcher processes the entered character and clears the text.  After that, it clears the textbox, and leaves it ready to listen for the next one.  However, it continues to fire after that.  I try setting a flag to only process every other firing, but sometimes it is devious and fires an odd number of times and flips the flag wrong.p  precodeOverride public void afterTextChangedEditable arg0      if arg0.length gt 0          if mToggle                      act.checkTextarg0.toString.substringarg0.length  1             text.setText                  mToggle  mToggle  to catch extra fireoff       codepre  pmToggle is a property variable of the TextWatcher implementation.p  p1 Why the multiple firingsp  p2 What do I need to do here insteadp  pThanks much,br Nathanp

This is a bit more complex than a simple hashmap so I would want to avoid trying to wedge it into the KV store that comes with Gwan.p  pAlso there are a number of Clibraries that would be great to interface with. Curious what the process of using a third party Clibrary with a Scala app on Gwan would be.p  pThanksp

Negative 64139 pIm wondering if my possibly strange use case is possible to implement in Varnish with VCL. My application depends on receiving responses from a cacheable API server with very low latencies i.e. submillisecond if possible.

Negative 64139 pIm working on a timing loop for the AVR platform where Im counting down a single byte inside an ISR. Since this task is a primary function of my program, Id like to permanently reserve a processor register so that the ISR doesnt have to hit a memory barrier when its usual code path is decrement, compare to zero, and codereticode.p  pa hrefhttpwww.nongnu.orgavrlibcusermanualFAQ.htmlfaqregbind relnofollowThe avrlibc docsa show how to bind a variable to a register, and I got that working without a problem. However, since this variable is shared between the main program for starting the timer countdown and the ISR for actually counting and signaling completion, it should also be codevolatilecode to ensure that the compiler doesnt do anything too clever in optimizing it.p  pIn this context reserving a register across an entire monolithic build, the combination codevolatile registercode makes sense to me semantically, as permanently store this variable in register coderXcode, but dont optimize away checks because the register might be modified externally. GCC doesnt like this, however, and a hrefhttpgcc.gnu.orgbugzillashowbug.cgiid34351 relnofollowemits a warninga that it might go ahead and optimize away the variable access anyway.p  pThe bug history of this combination in GCC suggests that the compiler team is simply unwilling to consider the type of scenario Im describing and thinks its pointless to provide for it. Am I missing some fundamental reason why the codevolatile registercode approach is in itself a Bad Idea, or is this a case that makes semantic sense but that the compiler team just isnt interested in handlingp

Negative 64139 pI have a two server system... one hosting the app and the other hosting the authenticationauthorization.  When the app detects the user isnt logged in yet, it redirects to the auth server and passes, as a parameter, the URL originally requested by the user so that after authentication, the user will be redirected back to the app server to the exact URL originally requested.p  pHowever, if that original URL contains a , the whole routine is hosed.  It appears that the browsers are decoding the url encoded parameter and, as a consequence, dropping anything after the  to the floor. Ive tried this on Chrome, Safari and Firefox.p  pExamplep  pOriginal URLp  precodehttpsxxx.commainbyusersparam153ampparam213ampparam339 codepre  pRedirect URLp  precodehttpsyyy.comsigninreturnURLhttps3A2F2Fxxx.com3A802F232Fmain2Fbyusers3Fparam13D5326param23D1326param33D39 codepre  pBrowser showsp  precodehttpsyyy.comsigninreturnURLhttps3A2F2Fxxx.com2Fmainbyusersparam153ampparam213ampparam339 codepre  pAs you can see, everything including and after the  is decoded.  Thus the server never gets the full returnURL parameter value.  It basically just gets p  precodehttpsxxx.com codepre  pThis must be part of some spec someplace, though it seems insane that an encoded  should be decoded and dealt with as if it were never encoded in the first place.  But how does one get around thisp  pThanks.p

I couldnt think of it during the exam, but after I thought of one way, but Im not too sure about it.p  pI could make an ArrayList of length x.  Then every time I run the whileloop, I would add an element to the top of the array, cascade down and kick off the last element of the array.  Then when the head hits null, return the node at the array[x1].p  pIs this right  Is there a better solutionp

Negative 64139 pI found this question somewhere on internet now facing same problem. With little change i already have modfied question below.p  pQuestionp  pstrongI want to access a file on remote machine10.10.20.30, but i couldnt understand how to login to that machine in my program. Is there any simple win api that takes network path, credentials and returns the handle of file i just want to access 10.10.20.30share foldertest.txt. Any suggestion will be helpful.strongp  psorry for not being very clear in coding sense. Detail I wanted to access a file that is shared in a shared folder but permission is not given to me. I am using bCreateFileb to get the handel of the file . But in this case i am reciveing error code 5 ACCESSDENIED. i need to use user my client credential username password to access file which is shared. I just need handle of file.Tell me if i am wrong CreateFile cannot be used in this case by using or modifying security attributes as MSDN says. CreateFile ignores the lpSecurityDescriptor member when opening an existing file.I also thought of using Window shell but could not reched a solution.p  pproblem Detail  strongWell the requirement is like this at remote machine i do not have EveryOne permission. Let me explain through an example. Suppose there is network with certain domain having atleast 3 computer lets say 5. Now there name are C1client,C2destination,C3,C4,C5. Now in this case i will create a fileany type at C2 machine and will put that in a folder say MyFolder. Now make it share and after that and remove EveryOne from it. After that add C5 as user for accessing it. Now you can see write the some code with just CreateFile implementation and run it on both machine C1client and C5it has permission. You will see clientC1 will get error 5 which means ACCESSDENIED but C5 will execute it and will get the file handle......Now again i am repeating my question i need to get the file handle by any means through my user name and password, And my program will get the handle from that C1 machine..strong p  pPlease advice me Thanks in advance p  pCreateFile Fails with Access denied is shell programming or other solution or hintp

When I open them in notepad, the language is set to XML and I can see syntax highlighting because I have followed the procedure explained in the above hyperlink. However I can have an XML file a file that contains valid XML with extension .kangaroo. I would like to know if there is way  such that when I open this file in Notepad, it detects that yes its an XML file and then automatically sets the language to XML. As a result the XML syntax highlighting will be there.p  pBy the way Microsoft Visual Studio already has this functionality i.e. if a file named Temp.kangaroo contains valid XML and I open it in VS 2012 then it will do syntax highlighting. However Notepad doesnt do that by default. We need to manually follow the process explained in the hyperlink above.p  pThanksp

Negative 64139 pI have an SSIS package which contains a C script used to invoke an SFTP executable with arguments.  This script really only calls the executable with arguments and downloads a set of files.  This part works flawlessly when I run it in visual studio, or execute the package manually on the server through integration services.  However, when I assign an agent to run this package the executable is never run.  Ive watched it and the executable is never even started.  Is there some way an agent would be unable to execute a C script within a package that contains a section of code to call an executablep  pI dont expect it to be a file path issue because I can right click and select Run Package in integration services on that same server and it will work.p
Negative 64139 pWe recently started using Jenkins for making our Builds. Being a CM person, I am able to compile the Code and gettings Build artifacts at Jenkins machine itself.

Negative 64139 pI am trying to solve a weird bin packing problem. A link for the original problem is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions18537335strangebutpractical2dbinpackingoptimizationherea sorry for the long question, thanks for your patiencep  pI am reiterating the problem as follows I am trying to write an application that generates drawing for compartmentalized Panel.p  pI have N cubicles 2D rectangles N lt 40. For each cubicle there is a minimum height minHeight[i] and minimum width minWidth[i] associated. The panel itself also has a MAXIMUMHEIGHT constraint.p  pThese N cubicles have to be stacked one on top of the other in a columnwise grid such that the above constraints are met for each cubicle.p  pAlso, the width of each column is decided by the maximum of minWidths of each cubicle in that column. p  pAlso, the height of each column should be the same. This decides the height of the panelp  pWe can add spare cubicles in the empty space left in any column or we can increase the heightwidth of any cubicle beyond the specified minimum. However we cannot rotate any of the cubicles.p  precodeOBJECTIVE TO MINIMIZE TOTAL PANEL WIDTH. codepre  pMAXIMUMHEIGHT of panel  2100mm, minwidth range 350mm to 800mm, minheight range 225mm to 2100mmp  pAs per the answer chosen, I formulated the Integer Linear Program.

If the minWidths are equal, then they are sorted in descending order of their minHeights.br I then solve it using the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBinpackingproblem relnofollowFirst Fit decreasing heuristica.

Negative 64139 pI have a mac server and I have both FINK and macport installation of pythonnumpyscipyp  pI was wondering if having both will affect the other In terms of memory leaksunusual results  In case you are wondering why both  Well I like FINK but macports allows me to have python2.4 which FINK does not provide yes I needed an old version for a piece of code I havep  pI wonder this since I tried to use homebrew once and it complained about the machine having port and FINK I did not realize that port provided python2.4 so was looking at homebrew but when I realized port did give 2.4 I abandoned itp
Negative 64139 pI have a bunch of drawing code primitive drawing, mostly bezier path drawing calls thats stored in a couple of files and the draw code runs to about a few hundred lines. I wanted to know if its possible to read this code from a file and execute it at a particular point in my program maybe a draw method of a UIView, much like what we do with shaders in openGL 2.0.p  pI want to be able to use this code to do my drawing but i dont want to copy the drawing code into the UIView class Im using because it becomes cumbersome to maintain and hardly readable, plus i have many such filesp  pI know that i can read the contents of a file using existing frameworks, but is there something that will allow me to execute the read contents of the file where i need this drawing code to runp  pAny ideashelp is appreciatedp
Negative 64139 pWe are looking to setup a site as oEmbed provider. Official docs a hrefhttpoembed.com relnofollowhttpoembed.coma sayp  blockquote   pConfiguration for oEmbed is very simple. Providers must specify one or   more URL scheme and API endpoint pairs. The URL scheme describes which   URLs provided by the service may have an embedded representation. The   API endpoint describes where the consumer may request representations   for those URLs.p blockquote  pThis is quite straightforward how to set up API endpoint to return some efficient information about URL provided as request parameter. But the question is how and where providers should specify those URL scheme and API endpoint pairs.p  pIf you have experience of going with oembed  provider for pinterest that is perfectly what I need to do.p  pThanks.p

So using codesetvbufcode to force unbuffered IO does not work, because the program image codesomebinarycode creates stdin and stdout streams of its own, and does not use the streams that I called codesetvbufcode on. p  pThe program does work when I rebuild codesomebinarycode after adding the codesetvbufcode calls in its code. But how can this be done if you do not have any control over the binary you are passing to codeexeccode How can this be made to work for, say, a unix command like codecatcode or codelscodep

Negative 64139 pI am doing what emshouldem be a simple calculation involving things like int64t, NSTimeInterval and NSDate in order to keep track of the expiration of a token which expires within an hour of its acquisition and is refreshed exchanged for a new one every 50 minutes. p  pThe code I have in place works most of the time, but every once in a while, for example it calculates that the time that has passed since the last token exchange was 16,000 days. Obviously something is very wrong somewhere, but I am just not seeing it. p  pHere is the codep  p1 Get a new token, its expiration is given in seconds until the token expires, which is always 3600 seconds, or 1 hour. I take this value in seconds and add it to the current time in terms of seconds since 1970 and store this as an int64t value in core datap  precodeNSTimeInterval secondsSince1970   [[NSDate date] timeIntervalSince1970] NSTimeInterval secondsUntilExpirationFrom1970  secondsSince1970   [[responseObject objectForKeyexpiresin]doubleValue]  account.tokenExp  [self.dataManager updateOAuthTokenExpirationDateForAccountaccount tokenExpirationsecondsUntilExpirationFrom1970] method that saves to managed object context codepre  p2  Now, every time a need to use the token, I first check to see if it is within 10 minutes or 600 seconds of expiring.  If it is, I request a new one and if not, I dont.p  precode BOOLtokenRequiresRefreshForAccountAccountaccount    NSTimeInterval secondsSince1970  [[NSDate date] timeIntervalSince1970]   NSTimeInterval secondsUntilTokenExpiration  account.tokenExp  secondsSince1970                   account.tokenExp is the saved expiration of the token a double in core data    NSLogThere are f minutes until the token expires and we  the token., secondsUntilTokenExpiration  60, secondsUntilTokenExpiration lt 600  will refresh  will not refresh    return secondsUntilTokenExpiration lt 600  codepre  pAs I said, the above log most recently returned a value that equated to 16,000 days having passed since the last check, this was logged 3 minutes after a log that said that there were 45 minutes remaining until the token expiration. p  pIf anyone can see my error or has a better approach for acquiring the same result, Id very much appreciate it.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pstrongIve seen some posts about underflowing a number variable. The variable secondsUntilTokenExpiration is occasionally a rather negative number...is it possible that I am underflowing this variable I have tried storing it as an int64t and an NSTimeInterval and both yield occasionally very incorrect values. If this could be the problem, how should I be storing this valuestrongp

Negative 64139 pIm trying to understand the unit tests when a database is involved. My classes heavily depends on a database to do their work. I already had a look at many many answers here on stackoverflow and on the internet in general, but Im not really happy with what I found.p  pOne of the common problems that I see when a database is involved MySQL in my case is that the tests are really really long to execute and one possible solution is to use SQLite.p  pI cant use it everywhere in the tests because some classes uses RAW queries instead of the Doctrine querybuilder to bypass the limitation of unknown datetime functions. SQLite has a different set of functions for date values and this means that to use it in the tests I should rewrite my queries twice, one for MySQL and one for SQLite.p  pI decided then to stick with MySQL, but creating and dropping the schema every time a test runs takes so much time. I know that the SchemaTool class can handle the creation of a subset of the schema would be a good solution to create only the tables I really need in the test suite or should I always use the full schemap  pstrongExample of the part of code pseudocode Im trying to teststrongp  precodeNotificationManagerClass     constructorEntityManager     loadNotifications     deleteNotification     updateNotification codepre  pas you can see, I inject the entity manager in the constructor of the class. The class is a service registered in the Symfony container. In the controller I then get this service and use its methods. Inside the methods I use the querybuilder because I must have access to some other services and a repository isnt containeraware. How can I decouple more than this my class I cant think a way to do itp

And I dont mind learning a little in the process.p  pShould I go on building it from scratch or are there tools out there to help  If I do build it from scratch do you know any tutorials that address this specific tasks ie. converting an existing site into dynamic wCMS All of the tutorials Ive seen are on building a site and CMS at the same time from scratch.  Or building a PHPMySQL dynamic website for user input like blogs, forums etcp  pThanks.p

Negative 64139 pSay I have a controller which upon initialization makes 3 different requests with the http service. I would like to write three different tests, each of which only cares about one of the requests.p  pFor example, suppose the controller looks likep  precodeapp.controllerExampleCtrl, functionscope, http    http.getfoo,  ...    http.getbar,  ...    http.getbaz,  ...   codepre  pThen I would like to write tests likep  precodedescribeExampleCtrl, function    var http    beforeEachinjectfunctionhttpBackend, controller      http  httpBackend     controllerExampleCtrl       itloads foo and does whatever, function      http.expectGETfoo.repond ...      http.flush     expect ...        itloads bar and does whatever else, function       etc.      codepre  pThis doesnt appear to work because, from what I can see, when I call codeflushcode Angular assumes I must have specified emallem of the requests that should have been made. So for instance if I only specified codeexpectGETfoocode then Angular will complain that there were unexpected requests to codebarcode and codebazcode.p  pIs there a way to do what Im trying to do here Am I approaching this problem from the wrong anglep  pOne approach, I realize, is that I could probably put all of the codeexpectGETcodes in a codebeforeEachcode and only test the results in test cases. But that seems like an unfortunate workaround, having to scatter my expectations across multiple places.p

Negative 64139 pIm trying something very different. We have legacy Windows Mobile programs that we need to run on Windows 8.1 tablets with capacitive screens. To do this weve installed the stand alone Windows Mobile 6.1 Emulator which runs without a problem. Doing this, we can load and run our old Windows Mobile programs on the 8.1 Tablet and they run well but we are having problems with the touch or mouse click. The emulator is meant to be used with a mouse button to select and click not a touch screen. When we run our old programs we have to doubletap in order to select anything. This is not a problem until we try to enter text from the emulator keyboard. We have to tap each key twice in order to enter a character. This becomes very tiresome and makes the legacy program useless. Our legacy Win Mobile program was designed to allow our field people to collect large amounts of text and numeric data. Having to tap each key twice will not work. p  pWeve examined the limited mouse and touch option in Windows 8.1 and nothing seems to help. So here are my questionsp  ol liIs there third party software that may improve on Windows 8.1 mouse customization Synaptic maybe li liIs there a command line switch for the emulator we could add that would fix this problemli liDoes anyone know of a method to fix thisli ol  pThanksp

Negative 64139 pA customer has asked me to pull some extra accounting data for their statements. I have been having trouble writing a query that can accomodate this.p  pWhat they initially wanted was to get all strongpaymentsstrong from a certain date range that belongs to a certain account, ordered as oldest first, which was a simple statement as followsp  precodeSELECT  FROM payments  WHERE salesinvoiceid    ORDERBY createdat ASC codepre  pHowever, now they want to have newly raised stronginvoicesstrong as part of the statement. I cannot seem to write the correct query for this. Union does not seem to work, and JOINS behave like, well, joins, so that I cannot get a seperate row for each paymentinvoice it instead strongmerges them togetherstrong. Ideally, I would retrieve a set of results as followsp  precodepayment.amount  invoice.amount  createdat  NULL            250.00          20140228 80000 120.00          NULL            20140228 80000 codepre  pThis way I can loop through these to generate a full statement. The latest query I tried was the followingp  precodeSELECT  FROM payments  LEFT OUTER JOIN salesinvoices  ON payments.accountid  salesinvoices.accountid  ORDER BY createdat ASC codepre  pThe first problem would be that the strongcreatedatstrong column is ambiguous, so I am not sure how to merge these. The second problem is that it merges rows and brings back duplicate rows which is incorrect.p  pAm I thinking about this the wrong way or is there a feature of MySQL I am not aware of that can do this for me Thanks.p

Negative 64139 pI am trying to use codeMappedMemoryBuffercode to storedelete portions of byte from the file. Atm, I use the following approach I have a position in the buffer marking the end of the data in the file buffer is a bit bigger than the file to accommodate for appending. Each data chunk is of fixed length, lets say 200 bytes.p  pMy first concern is marking of the end of the file. I can see two approaches to thatp  ol liUse some sort of a marker denoting the end of the actual data, while file size can be bigger due to the fact that I keep it slightly bigger for appending reasons. This might be tricky to come up with some sort of byte sequence that would be unique.li liAlways make sure that the file we read in is full i.e. if that file is 2000 bytes, that means there are 10 messages in it and nothing more. That is even trickier I think, as we would have to constantly truncate the file size and with open memory buffer that is quite cumbersome one cannot truncate the file size with open memory mapped fileli ol  pThats why I would lean more towards one, unless anyone knows a better approachp  pNow, while appending is very simple, the deletion of strongrandomstrong data chunk is not that straightforward. What I was thinking of doing was to shift the data to overwrite the deleted message. I simply move all the bytes to the right of message to the beginning of it.p  pIn general, is that the right strategy, or would anyone suggest something else or improvements to the conceptp

Negative 64139 pI have a WPF application, and in this app, I have created a custom UserControl. This Control has the ability to load a defined Layout from XML.

Negative 64139 pI have a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netsteveaeF5cp5 relnofollowstrongJSFiddlestronga with a resizable box. When doubleclicking anywhere on the document, the box color toggles between beige and red.p  pThe problem is that sometimes when releasing the left mouse button after resizing the box, a codedblclickcode event is generated and the box turns red. And sometimes you can release the mouse button without changing the box color, but then if you click just once in the box it generates the codedblclickcode and changes the box color.p  pUsually, everything works fine I resize and theres no codedblclickcode entry. I have to try maybe 20 times to get a false codedblclickcode event.p  pIm using Chrome.p  pI could partially fix this particular instance of the problem by adding code to the codedblclickcode handler to ignore the entry if a resize is in progress. That still doesnt fix the codedblclickcode entry, though, that happens very rarely  when I resize , get no codedblclickcode, but then get a codedblclikcode when I click just once in the box. p  pBut rather than just get the JSFiddle here to work, what Im looking for here is the reason this codedblclickcode is generated. Am I using the codedblclickcode event incorrectly Is there a known bug with this event and perhaps a better solution Is there some kind of switch bounce going on with the mouse buttonp  precodefunction      box.resizable     document.dblclickfunctione         console.logdoubleclicked on ,  e.target         box.toggleClassred       codepre
Negative 64139 pI have a list of words. I look up each of these words in WordNet and select the first synset. This first synset displays correctly on my terminal for example  Synsetprior.n.01. Then, I try to use a replacement regex on that converted string. The expected output is prior.n.01. But what I get is those square boxes with numbers in them. Since my terminal can display the string before it goes through the replacement, Im guessing the problem doesnt come from that.

Negative 64139 pUsing Entity Framework Im making a bunch of data changes in a loop and calling codeSaveChangescode at the end, but one of the tables has a data type that Entity Framework doesnt support so I use a raw update statement. This makes two things happen one, using codeExecuteSqlCommandcode causes the sql to be executed immediately, surrounded by codeexec spresetconnectioncode, which greatly affects performance, and two, its not part of the large transaction created by codeSaveChangescode, so if theres a problem its not simply rolled back.p  pThe transaction problem I believe can be solved by giving codeExecuteSqlCommandcode an outside transaction, but theres still a significant performance hit. Interestingly, I had the best performance by taking all of the generated sql strings, combining them into one big sql statement with a StringBuilder, then calling codeExecuteSqlCommandcode once right before codeSaveChangescode. This solution does not easily let me parameterize queries though, and would result in a huge, weird looking query with a massive array of objects representing all of the values.p  pSo is there a built in way or even a way at all for me to include some SQL to be included with codeSaveChangescode I looked into doing it with an extension method, but it doesnt even look like theres a way to disable performing codeexec spresetconnectioncode when codeExecuteSqlCommandcode is called in Entity Framework 6.p

Negative 64139 pIm writing a test harness for some C modules, one of which contains the sbit keyword.

However, Im writing the test harness using GCC, where sbit isnt defined. Ive tried every combination of static, const, int, and bool, none of which seem to satisfy the compiler. define doesnt work either, because these variables are assigned values further down in the code.p  pThere was a similar question on this site that suggested that sbit might be too low level for GCC.

Negative 64139 pstrongPrefacestrong Introducing YUI3 delegated ontap events has seemed to broken all onpage default click events... buttons, inputfield editing, radio button selection, etc. Everything worked fine before... all I did was include the codeeventtapcode module in a couple of relevant YUI calls wherever I need to delegate the ontap event.p  pstrongDetailsstrong My web app has to be used on both PC and touchscreen devices. My early versions just supported onclick event listener delegation, which worked fine emeven on most touch devicesem. Now, Im migrating to using more proper ontap event listeners whenever codeYUI.Env.UA.touchEnabledcode is true. But, since Ive made the update, none of my normal click events are working right on my iPad Air Safari iOS 7.1.1  while working just fine on an iPod Touch Safari iOS 6.1.3. And by normal click event I mean simplestandard buttons, fields, and elements with default click behavior baked into them emas mentioned in my preface aboveem.p  pstrongWebapp Descriptionstrong Sorry, my app is pretty large and complext to easily include code here but, basically, I have a dynamic list of items codeulcodecodelicode that Ive used YUI3s event delegation to define onclick subscriptions to.

Negative 64139 pWe have a site www.example.com which sends users off to a series of third party pages to verify payment details, which we do in an iframe. Initially, a local page from www.example.com is loaded in the iframe, and the user is redirected to the third party URL. Once the third party steps are completed by the user, they are 302 redirected back to a page on our site www.example.com within the iframe.p  pThis works in all browsers weve tested except IE 11, where our cookies appear to be lost. We have checked this under both Windows 7 and 8.1, in both desktop and Metro modes, and the problem is across all versions.p  pWhen a user browses our site we set a session cookie, which is correctly sent to the firstparty page that is initially loaded in the iframe. Once the user has gone through some thirdparty pages in this iframe however, the session cookie isnt sent with the next request.p  pIf we set IE 11s privacy setting to the lowest value, this issue disappears and things work as expected.p  pAll potential solutions Ive turned up so far have related to P3P headers. We have a valid and correct P3P header and XML policy file set up, and this problem only occurs in IE 11.p  hr  pstrongUpdatestrong We have a few other cookies set using JS. These are all persisting as expected. The differences are the expiry date 1 year for JS cookies, 1 month for session cookie, the domain explicitly example.com for JS cookies, empty for session cookie and whether they are HTTP only false for JS cookies, true for session cookie.p  pI have tried setting all of these options as per the JS cookies for the session cookie, but it made no difference.p  hr  pstrongUpdate 2strong After more testing I have been unable to create a test case that recreates this problem. Any additional cookies I try testing with in the live code however also appear to be broken, even if they are set with exactly the same code as the JS cookies which work. In short Ive not yet found any pattern to the cookies which work and those which dont.p  pOne potentially interesting thing to note is that the cookies arent being deleted, theyre just not being sent to the final request. If another page is loaded, the cookies magically reappear and are sent which leads me to believe this is a bug surrounding iframes and P3P.p  hr  pstrongUpdate 3 day 3strong IE 11s handling of cookies continues to confound me. The further I travel into Microsofts labyrinth the more lost I become amongst its shifting walls. And there are ghosts in here. Fragments of halfdreamt security policies that have woven themselves into some ethereal creature, which tracks and taunts me at every move. At first I was frozen, terrified, aghast at the barely fathomable form darting just out of sight, but with every passing hour I gather more comfort from the mere knowledge of its proximity. Could this be the very beast I have been sent here to confront How could I slay my only companion in such timesp

Negative 64139 pso I am running Python 3.4 and was wondering how I could use matplotlib to plot the maximum value as a point on my current linear graph. My current graph is very simply it has two lines with y values as scores and x values as time.

Negative 64139 pThe codesrand mancode says that codesrandcode has as parameter an unsignd int, but when using without casting the compile does not complain. Have any chance of going wrong if you do not use cast with codeunsigned intcode  Or not makes difference, because the compiler  always will convert it implicitly p  pAs an example, a code belowp  precodeincludeltstdio.hgt includeltstdlib.hgt  int mainvoid      int num, x      x  2          srandx     num  rand  100000      printfdn, num      return 0  codepre  pThe print of this code isp  precode32 codepre  pI will assume that the compiler will implicitly convert the variable x of type codeintcode in codeunsigned intcode .  What happens in this conversion  What if the conversion convert the variable that has type codeintcode to an codeunsigned intcode that is the same value than an other number that when after the seed was generated, they will be identical.  In other words p  precodeint x  2 int y  546  the number 546 is just an example   int numx  srand2 int numy  srand546 codepre  pAnd, behinde the scenes, codenumxcode is equal to codenumycode.p  pThis doubt appeared when I have had a negative parameter on my srand and I was in doubt if this seed would be unique. I think is not, because for an example, the code belowp  precodeincludeltstdio.hgt includeltstdlib.hgt  int mainvoid      int t, num     t  6      printfun, t   prints the variable t as unsigned implicitly converted         srandt     num  rand  100000     printfRandom number dn, num      srand4294967290    the number 4294967290 is how the int number 6 looks like when converted in unsigned int     num  rand  100000     printfNew random number dn, num     return 0  codepre  pThe output of itp  precode4294967290 Random number 19 New random number 19 codepre  pSo, always negative numbers after converted will behave like this   How do I take care of this p

Negative 64139 pOur company is currently using both the Telerik Silverlight tools and the Silverlight Toolkit to accomplish what we need in our program.  Since Silverlight is dying out and the Silverlight Toolkit has not been updated since 2011, we are removing all dependencies on the Silverlight Toolkit and trying to replace those controls with a Telerik Alternative so that we are not using both toolkits.  This way our customers only needs to download a 5mb file rather than a 10mb filebrbrIve gone through and removed just about every dependency except two, one of which is the ScrollViewer.  We use the Scrollviewer several times to create a scrollable area within another grid etc.  Ive looked around and found that Telerik doesnt have a direct alternative to the ScrollViewer but they do have some scrolling functionality within their RadGridView.  That wont exactly work for us, and either way it will be slow because is we put a RadGridView where the ScrollViewer is, we would be placing it in controls that have auto sizing or measure with infinity.  According to Teleriks site strongTry not to place RadGridView in controlspanels which will measure it with infinity.strong Either way that seems like it would be very cluttered in our case.brbrstrongI was wondering if there was some ScrollViewer alternative in Telerik that Id be able to use.strong  If worst comes to worst, does making our own custom ScrollViewer seem reasonablebrbrAny help is appreciated. Thanksp  pEDIT More specifically, the ScrollIntoView function in the ScrollViewerExtensions from the Silverlight 5 Toolkit needs replacing.  If there is no other control that has the built in functionality to scroll to an object within the control, then I can probably just create the method myself.p

Im having all content in a code.outerwrappercode which fills the whole body.

It always scrolls the content of code.outerwrappercode. I tried codewebkitoverflowscrollingtouchcode and codeoverflowy scrollcode. p  pstrongEditstrong Forgot to mention that code.slidercode is not a child of code.outerwrappercode.

Negative 64139 pIm using the strongcalendar.events.insertstrong API to add an Event to my Calendar via the PHP client. The event is being inserted correctly along with appropriate values as set by the API. The same however is not able to trigger an email invite to the attendees.

Negative 64139 pTo preface this I am running SQL Server 2005.p  pI am having a hard time deciding on which method to employ for an insert I am doing.p  pIt started off as a very simple 100 line insert using for examplep  precodeBEGIN TRAN INSERT INTO TABLE1 COL1, COL2, COL3, COL4 VALUES 1,2,3,4 INSERT INTO TABLE1 COL1, COL2, COL3, COL4 VALUES 5,6,7,8 INSERT INTO TABLE1 COL1, COL2, COL3, COL4 VALUES 9,10,11,12 INSERT INTO TABLE1 COL1, COL2, COL3, COL4 VALUES 13,14,15,16 codepre  pNow, I am a fan of readable and straight forward SQL, but it begins to urk me when the same code is repeated over and over and I was wondering if there was a better way of going about a repetitive insert such as this.p  pI have found CTEs and began to look up what I would need to do in order to work this in to my insert, to clean the code up a little bit. This has transformed my query in to the followingp  precodeBEGIN TRAN WITH CTEINSERT COL1, COL2, COL3, COL4 AS              SELECT 1,2,3,4 UNION ALL         SELECT 5,6,7,8 UNION ALL         SELECT 9,10,11,12 UNION ALL         SELECT 13,14,15,16      INSERT INTO TABLE1 COL1, COL2, COL3, COL4      SELECT COL1, COL2, COL3, COL4     FROM CTEINSERT codepre  pSo, this has made my query a little bit more dynamic probably a bad choice of words and has removed the repetition that was annoying me before, although it has some repetition to it, at least now the INSERT INTO repetition has gone.p  pIf I was running SQL Server 2008, I could obviously remove the repeating INSERT INTO that precede each line and just specify the values that I require inserting under the 1 INSERT INTO umbrella, but this is not an option.p  pMy question is, does this make the query better in any way aside from being a little easier on the eye which is probably subjective anyway Is this any more productive or bettereasier on the system then the original repetitive INSERT INTO query I am just over thinking this and should go back to what I was doing previously p  pThanksp

Negative 64139 pI have an Android app that gets its location every 3 seconds and displays it on a google map. After a while, the map stops updating, and reverts to 0,0 lat lng in its display. The rest of my app shows I am still getting new lat lng values back, but the map wont update and remains at 0,0. I think this has to do with some sort of quota for how many map images my app can request in a 24 hour period. If I wait until the next day, it works again. If I dont and instead reinstall the app and get a new registration id, it works again. Does anybody know anything about this possible limitation and how to remove it even if it involves payment I read about the 25,000 images limitation, but I dont think Im generating 25,000 from just one app riding around in a car for a half hour. And even if it were that, it would only generate a warning from them, not the stoppage of new map images. So there must be some other limitation going on that I cant find out about. Hope someone can help me. Thanks.p

When I serialize the class object which contains this as well as a few other non transient objects used for map rendering the file which is output only has a size of 4kb. To my understanding RAM usage depends upon the size of whatever is being read from, but apparently I am using up a max of 20 of my memory reading from a file that is less than 4kb in size. This leads me to believe that my understanding of how RAM works is wrong or I am missing something that is giving me bad RAM readings.p  pstrongMethod of RAM Analysisstrongp  precodeusedPercent  double Runtime.getRuntime.totalMemory  Runtime.getRuntime.freeMemory  Runtime.getRuntime.maxMemory codepre

Negative 64139 pI have a UITableView, for whom some not all UITableViewCells contain their own UITableView.p  pThe default behavior Im finding is, when trying to singletap scroll UIScrollViewPanGestureRecognizer the outermost table, scrolling works just fine, but only when the tap begins on a cell not containing a nested UITableView.  When the cell does contain a nested UITableView, that inner tables PanGestureRecognizer is invoked.  This behavior is understandable and expected.p  pMy desire is to disable all scrolling on the inner tables, emandem have any pan gestures that begin on them instead triggerinvoke scrolling on the outer table.p  pI have researched and tried several solutions, but without success.p  pDisabling all interaction in the nested cell isnt an option, because I need the ability to tapselect or swipedelete cells within the nested table.p  pI was able to find and remove the inner tables UIScrollViewPanGestureRecognizer.  This successfully disabled scrolling for the inner table.  However, I couldnt get the outer tables UIScrollViewPangestureRecognizer to be invoked.  Instead my outer table basically had dead spots the cells having a nested table where scrolling on the outer table wouldnt take place.p  pEverything Ive read about the view hierarchy and hittesting suggests that the above solution should simply work  the UITouch is wrapped in a UIEvent, and all possible receivers in the view hierarchy are thus queried.  Strangely enough, from the debugger, my view hierarchy appears to be severed at the point of the inner UITableView.  That is, for the UITableViewCell in question, its superview chain only leads to nil, not to the outermost table.  Yet, using the Reveal App www.revealapp.com, I have confirmed that my view hierarchy is indeed connected which makes sense, otherwise the inner table wouldnt be rendering.p  pLastly, I tried this codep  precode[innerTable.panGestureRecognizer requireGestureRecognizerToFailouterTable.panGestureRecognizer] codepre  pBased on my references, this should do exactly what Im seeking here  the inner table wont capture the pangesture unless the outer table defers.  But this code has no effect.p  pAny help you can provide is most appreciated  this has been a confounding UI mystery for many days nowp

So I loop again and do sayp  precodeSELECT  from countries WHERE code LIKE 44 codepre  pThis may give me say one result, now I can determine it is UK. Some codes however like Albania are three digits and require more loops and database calls. This seems quite rudimentary and inefficient but as is I cannot think of another way to achieve this. I realise three calls to a database may not seem like much but if you have 1000 calls to deal with they soon add up.p  pLooking at the following questionp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2113908whatregularexpressionwillmatchvalidinternationalphonenumbersWhat regular expression will match valid international phone numbersap  pThere seems to be some great information on validating a number against country codes, but not so much on determining the country code from a number.

Negative 64139 pI am currently developing a dct based jpeg encoder and got stuck on a problem with the luminance channel. The chrominance values seem to be correct.p  pA few words to the encoding procedure. The picture is based on ycbcr color values. Cb and Cr Channel is subsampled by 2. So SubSampling is 420. dc and ac coefficients are dct encoded and quantized. Grouped to 8x8 blocks, the dc values are calculated by delta differences and theyre category, ac values are run length encoded. The dc and ac values are written interlaced in yyyycbcr format. All Huffman Codes seem to be correct and tools like jpeg snoop finish decoding procedure without any warning of bad markers or huffman codes. everything seems alright. Picture 1 is the original picture in ppm format.p  pThis picture is read and transformed into a compressed jpeg format. picture 2 demonstrates the output of picture 1 after compression. Picture 3 shows the picture with max luminance values. all y channel values are set to 255 in picture 3.

Negative 64139 pIm trying to decide on the best internal interface to use in my code, specifically around how to handle file contents. Really, the file contents are just binary data, so bytes is sufficient to represent them.p  pIm storing files in different remote locations, so have a couple of different classes for reading and writing. Im trying to figure out the best interface to use for my functions. Originally I was using file paths, but that was suboptimal because it meant that disk was always used which meant lots of clumsy tempfiles.p  pThere are several areas of the code that have the same requirement, and would directly use whatever was returned from this interface. As a result whatever abstraction I choose will touch a fair bit of code.p  pWhat are the various tradeoffs to using BytesIO vs bytesp  precodedef putfilelocation, contentsasbytes def putfilelocation, contentsasfp def getfilecontentslocation def getfilecontentslocation, fp codepre  pPlaying around Ive found that using the FileLike interfaces BytesIO, etc requires a bit of administration overhead in terms of codeseek0code etc. That raises a questions likep  ul liis it better to codeseekcode before you start, or after youve finishedli lido you codeseekcode to the start or just operate from the position the file is inli lishould you codetellcode to maintain the positionli lilooking at something like codeshutil.copyfileobjcode it doesnt do any seekingli ul  pOne advantage Ive found with using filelike interfaces instead is that it allows for passing in the fp to write into when youre retrieving data. Which seems to give a good deal of flexibility.p  precodedef getfilecontentslocation, writeintoNone     if not writeinto         writeinto  io.BytesIO       get the contents and put it into writeinto      return writeinto  getfilecontentsblah, fileondisk getfilecontentsblah, gzipfile getfilecontentsblah, tempfile getfilecontentsblah, bytesio newbytesio  getfilecontentsblah  etc codepre  pIs there a good reason to prefer BytesIO over just using fixed bytes when designing an interface in pythonp

It means I will have to query everything and hit another service to get the geo, calculate, and finally able to sort...  p  pthank you very much p

The sampling process         captures at each sample if the session is in a nonidle wait,         an idle wait, or not in a wait. If the session is in a         nonidle wait then one interval is shown for all the samples         the session was in the same nonidle wait. If the         session is in an idle wait or not in a wait for         consecutive samples then one interval is shown for all         the consecutive samples. Though we display these consecutive         samples  in a single interval the session may NOT be continuously         idle or not in a wait the sampling process does not know.

This is accomplished by collecting the maps center geolocation on the dragend event. I then set a pin on top of the map outside of the JS map so that you know where the center point is.p  pEverything works fine until you pinch to zoom and the pin is then displaced. This is due to you zooming emand draggingem the map at the same time when pinching the screen. p  pstrongIs there any way to prevent dragging on zoom in order to hold the map at its center pointstrongp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netbxfn499f relnofollowstrongPlease view the JSfiddle here.strongap  precodevar map google.maps.event.addDomListenerwindow, load, onMapReady   function onMapReady       var center  new google.maps.LatLng30.267153, 97.743061     var mapOptions           center center,         zoom 13,         styles [featureType poi, stylers [ visibility off ],featureType transit,stylers [ visibility off ]],         disableDefaultUI true,           map  new google.maps.Mapdocument.getElementByIdmap, mapOptions      google.maps.event.addListenermap, dragend, function          center  map.getCenter                 log.htmlLat   center.lat   Lng   center.lng       codepre
Negative 64139 pI want to time a function call with rdtsc. So I measured it in two ways as follows.p  ol liCall it in a loop. Aggregate each rdtsc difference within the loop and divide by number of calls. Lets say this is Nli liCall it in a loop. Get the rdtsc difference of the loop itself and divide by N.li ol  pBut I see couple of inconsistent behaviors.p  ol liWhen I increase N the times get reduced rather monotonically in both method 1 and 2. For method 2 it is understandable in that it would amortize the loop control overhead. But I am not sure how it is so for method 1.li liActually for method 2 each time when I increase the N the value I get for N1 seems to be just divided by the new N each time. Inspecting gdb disassembly made me realize it is some compiler optimization at O2 where loop is skipped at second case.

The problem is when opening the given fragment, inflating the views takes quite a lot of time, becausep  pstrongEach ListView inflates 35 items for itself, because neither of the ListViews have scrap views yet.strongp  pstrongSo the fragment instantly inflates 1030 instances of the same view, which can easily cause a 200300ms long stutter, which is far from acceptable the fragment has a show and hide animation.strongp  pMy question would be, is there any way to speed up inflation aside from using ViewHolders, simplifying hierarchy, and the usual things. Since the views are of the same type, there could be same emglobal Recyclerem where the scrap views are stored, and outlive the life of the screen, which results in having scrap views when creating the ListView looked into the ListView source code, and would require a lot of coding and understanding of the internals.p  pSince there quite a lot of apps having a similar structure, Im curious how they solved if they could have the strongperformance issue on inflationstrong.p

Negative 64139 pIm used to deploy code depending on Composer PHPs NPM cousing, that sports code.jsoncode and code.lockcode files. The first one describes the package and your version constraints, and the second one lists exactly what was installed. Always theres a lock file and you run codecomposer installcode youre sure to receive the same set of packages running codecomposer updatecode will reread the json file, install new versions, and update the lock file.p  pThats awesome for production deployment, since you dont need to checkout your dependencies to your versioning system and youre sure to have the exact same set of dependencies in production as you have in development.p  pstrongMy question isstrong how to best automate deployment of NPMdependent code Is it possible to achieve a method similar to Composer Ive noticed that codenpm installcode only installs whats first available in the codepackage.jsoncode file. After the first run, i.e. if you change a version constraint you must manually codenpm updatecode that package  and that would render automate deployment useless, as theres no way to check in to versioning update this package here to a new version...p

Negative 64139 pI noticed my application was running a bit slowly during an NSTableView reload. On checking, I found that the tableView was asking for 104 more rows than it needed. For example, if the table was currently showing rows 018, then during initial load and during reloads, it would ask for views for the rows 0122. If I grow the window to, say, 22 rows, then it asks for 0125. If I then scroll down three rows now showing 324, then it asks for the additional 126127 rows. This is true for both tables in my window. p  pI checked the frame sizes, and the NSTableView itself grows proportionately to the numberOfRows, which I think is correct behavior, although it should only ask for the visible rows anyways. The frames for its superview NSClipView and superview.superview NSScrollView are both right height of 420 for the displayed size in the window.p  pFor background, the app loads data in the background, so the number of data rows grows after the program launches. The window is loaded from a NIB Im using autoresizing, not autolayout. There are hundreds of data rows in the table. The numberOfRows value is correct. p  pAny thoughts where to look for thisp

I need to do this because the issue Im working on manifests itself only when thousands of messages are sent per second.p  pThe solution offered above is not really feasible for me, as the code being debugged is in a remote location and I cannot really create the static class to track hits.  Is there either a default feature or a plugin that will simply count breakpoint hits, or is it not possible in eclipsep

Negative 64139 pI am building an installer with InstallShield. It is a basic MSI project Id rather not have any dependencies on InstallShield that might make it more difficult to move to WiX in the future. I am attempting to put some shortcuts into a custom folder that Id like to locate asp  precode[INSTALLDIR][PROP] Environment codepre  pThe shortcuts all will point to code[INSTALLDIR]My.exe [PROP]code, e.g. the installed executable with a commandline parameter.p  pIn InstallShield and, it appears, MSI I cant just set the folder in the Directory table to code[PROP] Environmentcode actually I can, but that gives me a folder literally named code[PROP] Environmentcode. Ive tried to use a type 35 Custom Action Set Directory but it either does nothing or gives me codeCould not access network location expanded property Environmentcode, depending on where in the sequence Ive got it. Currently it is in the UI sequence after SetupProgress. Ive tried it in various locations in both the UI and Execute sequences, with no luck.p  pIn case it makes a difference to the solution, the ultimate goal is to be able to run the installer multiple times either as maintenance or as multiple installations, but subsequent installs will simply add additional shortcuts in new folders, e.g.p  precodePROD Environment TEST Environment TRAINING Environment codepre  pFeel free to provide a WiX solution. Ive found the WiX documentation and code much better at explaining whats going on than the IS help.p  pstrikeUPDATE If it helps Ive already got a .Net Custom Action via DTF in case I can do things that way. Im thinking along the lines of creating the shortcuts in there. Im not sure how that will impact things like advertising, and I know Ill need to add a CA for uninstall to remove them.strikep  pUPDATE UPDATE It doesnt help. Or, at least, there is no need to do it that way, and, one might argue, it shouldnt be done that way.p

scrapy is crawling the pages, and so it is normal, or is it some problem What changes I must do in my code in order to resolve it li  li If you see I am printing the current second, and current microsecond, to check when both of my functions get entered and start getting processed. I have done this, basically to check whether both of my functions are actually getting multiprocessed or not. I know that, even after using the Multiprocessing, there is a time lag of a few microseconds, and that is very well acceptable from my end. But, I ran this script several times, and sometimes I noticed a time lag of only a few microseconds which I could well accept, but this case generally came when the sites returned only a few search results, so I dont know whether they actually got multiprocessed or not, because normally my functions independently execute in around 1.3 seconds and produce around 20 results., and sometimes I notice a time lag of around 1 or 2 seconds also that definitely says, that my functions havent got multiprocessed, at least after reading about the time  around 1.3 seconds in which my functions execute independently  had they been on different python scripts. So, why is this time variation occurring How do I check as to are my functions actually getting multiprocessed li ul  pPlease provide corrections in my code, and explanations to my 2 issues. p  pPlease do help Any answers, shall be well appreciatedp  pThanksp

Negative 64139 pHey so the application Im working on has navigation based on gestures, where dragging up or down will start transitioning to another view controller, in some predefined order. It is similar to a vertical UIPageViewController but is implemented using only ViewControllers and gesture recognizers.p  pstrongIssuestrongp  pI have one of the child views of these pages which is a UIWebView. The normal tracking code that I have uses a UIPanGesturerRecognizer so that I can track the users finger all throughout the view controller transition and update the view accordingly. Though the UIWebViews UIScrollView captures the scrolling event, meaning that the parent view controllers gesture recognizer is blocked from the gesture and I cannot transition up or down to another view controller. p  pstrongWhat Ive triedstrongp  pIf I disable scrolling on the WebViews UIScrollView, when the content overflows the bounds of the page, I cannot scroll to see the overflowed content. I have tried to only disable scrolling when at the bottom or top of the page, so that the user would first scroll to the top or bottom and then could scroll between the view controllers, but this will get stuck in a state where I can no longer track touches normally as the user is already at the top or bottom of the page and scrolling is disabled within the scrollview. I have also flirted with the idea of somehow transitioning the touch tracking from the ScrollView to the UIPanGestureRecognizer when the scrollview starts a bounce area, but it seems like I cannot transfer a tracking midgesture to another gesture recognizer.p  pI would appreciate any suggestions of how I could move forward with this issue Thanksp

Negative 64139 pIm developing an application that needs to be able to communicate with devices over Serial Comms on Windows OS. The application is written in Java. I am using the jSSC library. Javax.comm has issues and RxTx has no Java 8 support apart from an unofficial update The devices may connect directly to the PC using a Serial Port, or alternatively using a USBtoSerial converter.p  pMy Question COM ports on windows are dynamic. This raises an issue for defining which comm port to connect to. Is there a way to automatically figure out which COM port to connect to p  pSo far the only solutions I have been able to come up with involves scanning all the com ports for active ports, saving this list and then asking the user to insert the device and performing another scan  the additional COM port will then be the one to connect to.p  pAlternatively, the device will respond to a specific identification packet I can open each COM port and send this packet and evaluate the response. This has the risk of the other devices being hijacked for a short period of time which is not ideal.p

Negative 64139 pI have a solution with three projects p  ol liA web application WAli liA Data Model Layer DML using code first, and li liA Data Access Layer DALli ol  pThe WAs codeweb.configcode and the DMLs codeapp.configcode each have a connection string section specifying a connection string for the database. p  pIve noticed that the DML connection string doesnt really matter. So is it safe to completely remove this section from the codeapp.configcode file p  pAlso, why is this string unused Finally, Im guessing when the application is run, the connection to the database is established using the connection string in the codeweb.configcode file and the database definition is managed by the DMLDAL p  pIs this because the other projects arent really being run per se, just the methods and properties are being referenced Thanksp

Negative 64139 pI have a large folder of files that needs to be transferred to a remote site. This folder is currently 10GB total, but contains lots of much smaller files.p  pRather than copying the entire 10GB each time, wed like to massively reduce the data transfer size to be only the files that are new or changed. We plan to do this like sop  pcodeSOURCEDIRcode is the folder that has all the files and is uptodate.p  pcodeCOMPAREDIRcode is a directory clone of the folder at the remote end. It is basically all the files up to the last time files were transferred.p  pcodeTRANSFERDIRcode is an empty folder that we hope ROBOCOPY can place files that are new or changed in codeSOURCEDIRcode when compared with codeCOMPAREDIRcode into.p  pAn examplep  pcodeSOURCEDIRcode has 4 files 1.txt, 2.txt, 3.txt, 4.txtp  pcodeCOMPAREDIRcode has 3 of those files 1.txt, 2.txt, 3.txtp  pThe ROBOCOPY command would compare codeSOURCEDIRcode with codeCOMPAREDIRcode and see that 4.txt isnt in codeCOMPAREDIRcode so copies it into codeTRANSFERDIRcodep  pcodeTRANSFERDIRcode then only has 4.txt file in it which we can copy up to the remote end and place in the folder making it the same as our codeSOURCEDIRcode this end.p  pThis can be done with rsync using the comparedestDIR argument, but as this is Windows, Id rather not have to install rsync unless I need to.p

Thank youp  pstrongEDIT 1strongp  pI have classes within classes. like Case 1  TestA0  TestB0  TestC0  and Case 2  TestX0  TestX1 p  pI realise now that in the first case will be easier to use getter and setter to get the right value, because I will have a instance of a object inner, values in TestC0 and the sum in TestA0.br Now Im thinking about for example, I have values in TestX1 and a sum of this values in TestA0, will I be required to create a instance in TestA0p

Negative 64139 pI have read numerous posts on the problems but have not found a solution yet... so here is my new post.p  pAll my domains are hosted at GoDaddy.  The main url is helloguest.com.au.  I have setup heavenlyhyams.com.au to forward with masking to helloguest.com.auHeavenlyHyams, but the responsiveness on mobile is lost due to the frame.p  pIt is important for me to mask the final url, so what is the best solutionp  pI saw a post that the same result can be achieved without masking but by adding a CNAME... but I dont understand how.  So please explain step by step if that is possible.p  pThe second option I am currently trying is to control the frame code.  So for that I have setup heavenlyhyams.com as an addon domain and add the same frame code in the index file.  There seems to be several way to add responsiveness to the frame, so I would appreciate if someone could help me here.p
