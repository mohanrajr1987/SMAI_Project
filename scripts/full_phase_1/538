Positive 538 pI have just learnt how to upgrade a module in Erlang and I know that only the function calls that use the fully qualified names eg. codemodulefunctioncode gets relinked to the current version loaded into the VM, but the function calls that do not specify the modules name do not get relinked to the current version, but keep using the older one.p  pIs there a rule of thumb on when to use a fully qualified function call and when its OK to call a function just by its name Is it a bad idea to call all functions using their full name like codemodulefunctioncodep

Positive 538 pIs there any kind of test framework for Erlang which is similar to a hrefhttpdoc.akka.iodocsakkasnapshotscalatesting.htmlAsynchronousIntegrationTestingwithTestKit relnofollowTestKita in Akka p  pThe goal is to test processes in an integrated environment, for example, to send some messages to a group of processes on one end and assert the resulting messages coming out on the other end.

Positive 538 pErlang is great about cleaning things up by not having shared state. But what happens when you do want shared state For example configuration options, statistics gathering, eventcallback servers. Spawning up a new processes with some record as state or using the process dictionary is a way to accomplish shared state. You would loop that process over and over and reply to any messages. Multiple processes will just query that process using what are essentially impure getter and setter functions that wrap around message passing, but here we just turned Erlang into an impure object thats slower than a java object because of the reduction system taking turns is slower than just having a memory mutex around each global state. It even has the possibility of having a mailbox overflow if were not careful.p  pSo what do you do if you want fast shared state Reddis, a database, mnesia, spawns looping state How do you make centralized state more purely functional in erlangp

The paper implied that variables that were defined inside a method would be considered a GC root until the method exited, and not until the code block ended. Therefore setting the variable to null was necessary to permit the Object referenced to be garbage collected.p  pThis meant that a local variable defined in a conditional block in the main method or similar method that contained an infinite loop would cause a oneoff memory leak unless you nulled a variable just before it dropped out of scope.p  pThe code from the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma2718247938chosen answera illustrates the issue well. On the version of the JVM referenced in the document, the foo object can not be garbage collected when it drops out of scope at the end of the try block. Instead, the JVM will hold open the reference until the end of the main method, even though it is impossible for anything to use that reference.p  pThis appears to be the origin of the idea that nulling a variable reference would help the garbage collector out, even if the variable was just about to drop out of scope.p

Negative 538 pIs it possible to pass a lambda expression to a secondary AppDomain as a stream of IL bytes and then assemble it back there using DynamicMethod so it can be calledp  pIm not too sure this is the right way to go in the first place, so heres the detailed reason I ask this question...p  pIn my applications, there are a lot of cases when I need to load a couple of assemblies for reflection, so I can determine what to do with them next. The problem part is I need to be able to unload the assemblies after Im finished reflecting over them. This means I need to load them using another codeAppDomaincode.p  pNow, most of my cases are sort of similar, except not quite. For example, sometimes I need to return a simple confirmation, other times I need to serialize a resource stream from the assembly, and again other times I need to make a callback or two.p  pSo I end up writing the same semicomplicated temporary codeAppDomaincode creation code over and over again and implementing custom codeMarshalByRefObjectcode proxies to communicate between the new domain and the original one.p  pAs this is not really acceptable anymore, I decided to code me an codeAssemblyReflectorcode class that could be used this wayp  precodeusing var reflector  new AssemblyReflectorCMyAssembly.dll      bool isMyAssembly  reflector.Executeassembly gt              return assembly.GetTypeMyAssembly.MyType  null       codepre  pcodeAssemblyReflectorcode would automize the codeAppDomaincode unloading by virtue of codeIDisposablecode, and allow me to execute a codeFuncltAssembly,objectgtcodetype lambda holding the reflection code in another codeAppDomaincode transparently.p  pThe problem is, lambdas cannot be passed to other domains so simply. So after searching around, I found what looks like a way to do just that pass the lambda to the new codeAppDomaincode as an IL stream  and that brings me to the original question.p  pHeres what I tried, but didnt work the problem was codeBadImageFormatExceptioncode being thrown when trying to call the new delegatep  precodepublic delegate object AssemblyReflectorDelegateAssembly reflectedAssembly  public class AssemblyReflector  IDisposable      private AppDomain domain     private string assemblyFile     public AssemblyReflectorstring fileName  ...      public void Dispose  ...       public object ExecuteAssemblyReflectorDelegate reflector              var body  reflector.Method.GetMethodBody         domain.SetDataIL, body.GetILAsByteArray         domain.SetDataMaxStackSize, body.MaxStackSize         domain.SetDataFileName, assemblyFile          domain.DoCallBack gt                      var il  byte[]AppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetDataIL             var stack  intAppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetDataMaxStackSize             var fileName  stringAppDomain.CurrentDomain.GetDataFileName             var args  Assembly.ReflectionOnlyLoadFromfileName             var pars  new Type[]  typeofAssembly               var dm  new DynamicMethod, typeofobject, pars,                 typeofstring.Module             dm.GetDynamicILInfo.SetCodeil, stack              var clone  AssemblyReflectorDelegatedm.CreateDelegate                 typeofAssemblyReflectorDelegate             var result  cloneargs  lt BadImageFormatException thrown.              AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetDataResult, result                    Result obviously needs to be serializable for this to work.         return domain.GetDataResult       codepre  pAm I even close whats missing, or is this a pointless excercise all in allp  pNOTE I realize that if this worked, Id still have to be carefull about what I put into lambda in regard to references. Thats not a problem, though.p  pstrongUPDATE I managed to get a little further. It seems that simply calling codeSetCode...code is not nearly enough to reconstruct the method. Heres whats neededstrongp  precode Build a method signature. Since we know which delegate this is, this simply  means adding its argument types together. var builder  SignatureHelper.GetLocalVarSigHelper builder.AddArgumenttypeofAssembly, false var signature  builder.GetSignature   This is the tricky part... See explanation below. di.SetCodeILTokenResolver.Resolveil, di, module, stack dm.InitLocals  initLocals  Value gotten from original methods MethodInfo. di.SetLocalSignaturesignature codepre  pThe trick is as follows. Original IL contains certain metadata tokens which are valid only in the context of the original method. I needed to parse the IL and replace those tokens with ones that are valid in the new context. I did this by using a special class, codeILTokenResolvercode, which I adapted from these two sources a hrefhttpwww.codeproject.comKBcsExpressionEval.aspx relnofollowDrew Wilsona and a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.comhaibo5Fluoarchive20061106systemreflectionbasedilreader.aspx relnofollowHaibo Luoa.p  pThere is still a small problem with this  the new IL doesnt seem to be exactly valid. Depending on the exact contents of the lambda, it may or may not throw an InvalidProgramException at runtime.p  pAs a simple example, this worksp  precodereflector.Executea gt  return 5  codepre  pwhile this doesntp  precodereflector.Executea gt  int a  5 return a  codepre  pThere are also more complex examples that are either working or not, depending on some yettobedetermined difference. It could be I missed some small but important detail. But Im reasonably confident Ill find it after a more detailed comparison of the ildasm outputs. Ill post my findings here, when I do.p  pstrongEDITstrong Oh, man. I completely forgot this question was still open. But as it probably became obvious in itself, I gave up on solving this. Im not happy about it, thats for sure. Its really a shame, but I guess Ill wait for better support from the framework andor CLR before I attempt this again. Therere just to many hacks one has to do to make this work, and even then its not reliable. Apologies to everyone interested.p

I dont want to stop user pressing the Refresh button... But all I want is to adjust my applications response accordingly... Imagine a scenario, when user clicks BUTTONA a popup window opens with another page. Now when the user comes back and clicks refresh button in the main window, the click event of BUTTONA is fired again and popup window is opened again... In such scenario, I want to refresh the page as such, without opening the popup window. so, I need to stop ASP.NET from firing the click event of BUTTONA or any other similar buttons p

Negative 538 pI am trying to get the hang of MVC framework so bear with me. p  pRight now, the only thing Im using the session store for is storing the current logged in user. My website is simple.

Once the data is sent back to the server looks like this codere.compiler[s,]dsdd[s,]code  Unfortunately the codescode in my regular expression is not matching my data, and I traced the problem down to the fact that the html page uses codeampnbspcode which gets encoded to code0xA0code nonbreaking space and sent to the server. For some reason, it seems, my script is not interpreting that character as whitespace and is not matching. According to the python [documentation][1] it looks like this should work, so I must have an encoding issue here.p  pI then wanted to try converting the string into unicode and pass it to the regular expression, so I tried to view what would happen when I converted the string codeprintunicodedata, iso88591code. p  pUnfortunately I got this error  codeUnicodeEncodeError at script ascii codec cant encode character uxa0 in position 122 ordinal not in range128codep  pIm confused though  Im obviously not trying to use ASCII decoding  is python trying to decode using ASCII even though Im obviously passing another codecp

I have done these and the same problem happens.p  pFor instance, on one part of my site, you can change the profile picture. If I choose to remove the profile picture which should then set to the default picture, it only deletes the picture but doesnt display the default picture. The page loads again but it still references to the picture I deleted so I get an X for the picture. I have to go onto a different page, and then back to the profile page for me to see the default picture. CTRL  REFRESH also works.p  pNote that this particular problem happens under all browsers Chrome included.p  pIf it helps, I am using Content pages which are in a master page.p

Negative 538 pThis snippet of code populates an codeoptionscode hash. codevaluescode is an codeArraycode which contains zero or more heterogeneous items.

There is a special case if the values its about to populate a key with are an Array consisting entirely of 1 Symbols or 2 Hashes whose keys are Symbols or some combination of the two, then they should be treated as emsubkeysem rather than the values associated with that key, and the same logic used to evaluate the original codepopulatecode arguments should be recursively reapplied.p  pThat was a little hard to put into words, so Ive written some test cases.

Negative 538 pMy problem is twofold 1 Im trying to determine an eloquent way to allow the user to type into a UITextView and store the time each word was typed into an array. The time will be a float which starts at 0 when the user begins to type. 2 Conversely, Id like the user to be able to tap on a word in the UITextView and display the time that word was typed displaying in an NSLog is fine.

Negative 538 pIt occurs to me that state control in languages like C is not well supported.p  pBy this, I mean, it is left upto the programmer to manage the state of inmemory objects. A common usecase is that instance variables in the domainmodel are copies of information residing in persistent storage i.e. the database. Clearly this violates the single point of authority principle, and synchronisation has to be managed by the developer.p  pI envisage a system where instead of instance variables, we have simple public accessmutator methods marked with attributes that link them to the database, and where reads and writes are mediated by a framework that decides whether to hit the database. Does such a system existp  pAm I completely missing the point, or is there some truth to this ideap

Negative 538 pWhen you tap the bookmark, it slides down or up smoothly. As it slides up, it disappears as if behind the view directly above it.

Do I need to change the bounds of the UIImageView, or should I use the frame I thought I could just change the height from X to 0, but it didnt seem to resize the UIImageView.

Negative 538 pThis is the statement from ISO C Standard 14.68p  blockquote   pWhen looking for the declaration of a name used in a template definition, the usual  lookup rules are used for nondependent names. The lookup of names dependent on the template parameters is postponed until the actual template argument is known 14.6.2.p blockquote  pExamplep  precode  include ltiostreamgt   using namespace std   templateltclass Tgt class Set              T p             int cnt   public             Set             SetltTgtconst SetltTgtamp             void printall                                      for int i  0 iltcnt i                                    cout ltlt p[i] ltlt n                           ...    codepre  pin the example, i is the local variable i declared in printall, cnt is the member cnt declared in Set,and cout is the standard output stream declared in iostream. However, not every declaration can be found this way the resolution of some names must be postponed until the actual templatearguments are known. For example, even though the name operatorltlt is known within the definition of printall and a declaration of it can be found in , the actual declaration of operatorltlt needed to print p[i] cannot be known until it is known what type T is 14.6.2. p  pIam unable to understand this point...and the example toop  pcan any one tell an other example for this statement...pleasep

Negative 538 pOk so Ive got a problem Ive been working on for the last week or so and have tried everything I know or could find.  I am using YUI 2.x editor where users will be doing some heavy formatting.  I have an external button on the page that needs to wrap the selected text in a codeltspangtcode when the user clicks it, but it must do this strongwithoutstrong loosing any formatting.  For some reason doing the following likes to erase all of the formatting in the selectionp  precodevar sel  myEditor.getSelection var newEl  ltspangt  sel  ltspangt myEditor.execCommandinserthtml, newEl codepre  pSo to solve this, I think the best way is to use codegetSelectedElementcode along with codecreateCurrentElementspancode to add back the style elements.  Heres what Ive got so farp  precodefunction createSpan    var el  myEditor.getSelectedElement   var sel  myEditor.getSelection     IE support   if document.selection      sel  myEditor.getDoc.selection.createRange     newText  sel.text      else      newText  sel        Create the new element with the old styles   myEditor.createCurrentElementspan, color el.style.color, fontSize el.style.fontSize, fontFamily el.style.fontFamily   myEditor.selectNodemyEditor.currentElement[0]   myEditor.currentElement[0].innerHTML  newText   return myEditor.currentElement[0]  codepre  pThis works great if codegetSelectedElementcode properly returns the element with the correct styles, but I have found that if a user selects an entire paragraph, it will return the codeBODYcode.  And since the codeBODYcode doesnt have any styles, they again get lost.  p  pBasically, I need it to behave like the Bold button on the toolbar but use a codeltspangtcode and not codeltbgtcode.  Why is this so hardp  pAny ideas or suggestions Thanksp

Negative 538 pI am a beginner with a site made in Dreamweaver CS4 using HTML and CSS. Every page has a slightly different amount of content. The page content is designed to overlap the footer, so that the top part of the footer can be seen behind the bottom of main content images and the bottom of the footer lines up with the bottom of the page.p  pI havent been able to achieve a position where the footer allows for the same amount height of content to sit over it on every page, although I have been trying with changing all the margin and padding values etc. Currently the footer is jumping around from one page to another.p  pWhat I would like is for the footer to always be below all other content but with a negative top margin  padding effect, allowing the bottom of main content to sit on top of it  I just cant seem to make it happen Advice would be very much appreciated. Thanks in advance.p

If necessary, however, you may call executePendingTransactions from your UI thread to immediately execute transactions submitted by commit. Doing so is usually not necessary unless the transaction is a dependency for jobs in other threads.

Rather than have the user stare at a blank page while creating the nodes I am trying to use UpdateProgress for a loading image.p  pSearching through various threads on the internet has given me a couple of different things I have tried, both of which have their own issues that I cant seem to resolve.p  pOption 1 uses the following javascriptp  precodefunction pageLoad          doPostBackbtnBuildTree,       codepre  pThis event is auto wired up and so I dont need to add an onload tag to the body element.

Negative 538 pI was talking to a guy who was using an ATM when it crashed it was running Windows XP, apparently and took his money.p  pA transactional database with writeahead logging can ensure that your database remains in a consistent state, even if the ATM crashes i.e. you will always know how much money ishouldi be in the ATM and in the customers account. Dispensing cash, however, is not just a DB transaction and is not an instant operation, so should you commit the transaction before or after the cash is dispensed In both cases, it is possible for either the bank or the customer to lose money if the ATM crashes at the right time. p  pAre there any perfect or at least reasonably perfect solutions to this problem p  pOne way I can think is if the ATM had the capability to count the amount of money in it. If the ATM committed the transaction first and then dispensed the cash, then upon recovering from a crash, the ATM could immediately dispense any additional money above what it should contain according to the guaranteed consistent database.p  pBut from a hardware standpoint I dont know if that would really be feasible. p  pWhat do you think Are there any other ways to deal with this issuep

For examplep  precodeltpgt...ltpgt ltulgtltligt...ltligtltulgt codepre  pAnother examplep  precodelth1gt...lth1gt codepre  pA more challenging case will be an input without a properly structured HTML e.g. codelth1gtHelloltpgtlth1gtcode.

I have been struggling with this now  so any pointers would be really appreciated p  pSince web sockets are not supported in most browsers, I think long polling is the right choice. Right now I am looking for something that scales better than regular polling and is easy to integrate with python django stack. Once I am done with this development, I plan to evaluate other python frameworks tornado  twister, gevent etc. come to mind.p  pI did some research and liked the redis pubsub mechanism. The chat message gets published to a channel to which both users have already subscribed to. Following are my questionsp  ol lipFrom what I understand, apache would not scale well since long polling would soon run into processthread limits. Hence I have decided to switch to nginx. Is this rationale correct Also are there any issues involved in nginx that I am worried about In particular, I am worried about the latest version not supporting http 1.1 for proxy passing as mentioned in the blog post at a hrefhttpwww.letseehere.comreverseproxywebsockets relnofollowhttpwww.letseehere.comreverseproxywebsocketsapli lipHow do I create the client portion of the subscription of messages on the browser side In my mind, it would be a url to which the javascript code would long poll. So at the javascript level, the client would poll a url which gets blocked in a non blocking way at the server side. When a result in this case a new chat message appears, server returns the result. Javascript does what it needs to and then again polls the same url. Is this thinking correct What happens in between the intervals when the javascript loop is pausing  do we loose any messages from the server side.pli ol  pIn essence, I want to create the followingp  ol lipFrom redis, I publish a message to a channel foo can use rediscli also  easy to incorporate it later in pythondjangopli lipI want the same message to appear in two browser windows that use the same js code to poll. Assume that the browser code knows the channel name for test purposepli lipI publish a second message that again appears in two browser windows.pli ol  pI am new to real time apps, so apologies for any question that may not make sense.p  pThank youp

I compute the distance between P1 and P2, say strongDstrong, and I choose a random velocity, say strongVstrong. Next, I compute the time required to move from P1 to P2, say strongTstrong. Finally, I compute the equation of the straight line between P1 and P2 as y  mx  b.p  pFor example, let T  10 seconds. For the first 9 seconds, I would like to generate points per second on the straight line until I reach point P2 at the 10th second. Could you please assist me in doing so.p

Negative 538 pWhen I am learning custom component development in JSF, I got confused with the relationship between component family, component type and renderer type.

However, I didnt understand why the line codeltcomponentfamilygtjavax.faces.Panelltcomponentfamilygtcode is required on renderer registration. In codemy.taglib.xmlcode, the component and the renderer is connected and, IMHO, it should have been enough to select an appropriate renderer for the component. What is the use of the additional parameter codeltcomponentfamilygtcodep  pI did Google researches and all the answers I got say like One renderer can be used to render multiple components. These components belong to one family. But these statements didnt clear my confusion up.

Negative 538 pI have a problem with the CSS managing the style of my web page. The developer who did the work was unable to make it working after months of work. So now Im trying to make it work by myself. Im not developer, and I only have few skills of PHP and HTML, but Im a fast learning profile, so if someone can help me, I will really appreciate. OK, here we go.p  pMy web page has two iframes. The left one, is loading a jquery application and the right one is loading a DHTML application.

Negative 538 pI have a common project called common.  Inside is a class called ExtensionMethods which is used by legacy applications.

What is causing this  Is the filename infomation embedded in the dll somehow  Do partial classes make the old and new dll incompatible  Whats the deal  The dll is not versioned, and we are not using the gac.  Its just a simple dll placed in the same directory as the exe.p  pstrongUpdatestrong Thank you everyone for the suggestions so far.

Negative 538 pI need to process an input file, and copy its content line by ilne to an output file. However, there are some unimportant data stray inside this input file that I need to skip. The main problem that I am trying to solve is actually more complicated than this, but I am just gonna simplify the problemp  pSo, I have an input file containing hundreds of thousands of lines. If the following sequence of 3lines occur inside the input filebr Abr Bbr C  p  pthen I need to skip these 3 lines and proceed with the next line in the input file. I can only skip these 3 lines if these 3 lines occur as a sequence of consecutive lines.p  pFor examplebr Input File  p  pAbr Abr Bbr Cbr Bbr Pbr Abr Bbr Cbr Abr Bbr Abr Abr Bbr Cbr A  p  pOutput filebr Abr Bbr Pbr Abr Bbr Abr A  p  pClarificationbr Abr A skippedbr B skippedbr C skippedbr Bbr Pbr A skippedbr B skippedbr C skippedbr Abr Bbr Abr A skippedbr B skippedbr C skippedbr A  p  pNotice that I can skip the sequence of lines A, B, C only if they occur sequentially. All the other lines which are not skipped have to be copied to the output file. If I use BufferedReader.nextLine, I cannot backtrack to the previous lines if the next line doesnt match the input pattern. For example, if I already encounter an A, and the next line is another A not B, I then have to copy the first A to the output file, and start the filtering again from the second A which I have not processed, and check the next following line, and so on. p  pOne way that I can think of is to firstly save the contents of the input text file, so I can easily backtrack when traversing the input file contents if it doesnt match the pattern I am looking for. However this is not a memorywise solution. Is there any clever algorithm to solve this, preferably in one time traversal, i.e. O N complexity Or if this is not possible, what would be the most optimal solution which is still memorywise Some example C  Java codes will be really helpful. p

Negative 538 pWhat Im asking for may be different than a group push where the collection of clients normally remain relatively constant.  p  pIn a notification system, clients can create events that not all other clients are subscribed to.  For example, a client indicates that they dont want to receive notifications of new logins, but wants to know when a new photo is published from only certain users.  The combinations are endless, and created on the fly, so you cant do a group push.p  pOn each event, a new collection of clients will be created that will receive a notification.  Is there a way to accomplish this with a bulk push rather than individual private messagesp  pWould the way to implement this be to create groups on the fly on the server side, add clients to that group then send a message to that groupp  pThanks.p

Negative 538 pIve been mulling around the idea of how youd construct a MVC framework in Haskell in the mold of WPF or AngularJS, but cant seem to find the key types or idea to get started. So unfortunately vague question  has anyone else out there been thinking about this problem p  pI see editlenses, multiplate and Compos, but I think they all solve slightly different problems.p  pMy rough sketch of how that would work would bep  ol liCreate a model as a plain haskell data structure  li liCreate a set of lenses or commands to modify your model. li liWrite a HTML or whatever template which is parametised by the types in the model.li ol  p.p  precodedata Model  Page  title  String, content  [Int, String]   title  Lens Model String content  Int gt Lens Model Maybe String codepre  pThen I would want to be able to write a functionp  precodeModel gt Template Model gt Html codepre  pand a function to update parts of my view when I apply a lens.p  precodeLens Model a gt a gt HtmlTemplate Model gt [Path, Html] codepre  pSo I guess the question is  what type would a lens take which can operate on one data structure, then be used to describe the change in another. p  pOne possibility seems to be to create a GADT which wraps all the lenses and then template the HTML over the GADT type which can then be used to match against the template at each step. e.g.p  precodedata Lenses a b where     Title  Lens Model String gt Lenses Model String     Item   Lens Model String gt Lenses Model Maybe String codepre  pThen a Html Template data type e.g. p  precodedata HtmlTemplate a  Text String                 Element String [Attrib a]                 forall b. Binding Lenses a b Html b codepre  pTo which the Binding element can be pattern matched against directly.p  pBut that seems almost defeating the point, because the model is then joined at the hip to the view.p  pI wonder has anyone smarter than I out there put thought into how this might work Or even if this is a good idea p

Negative 538 pI have a game with a mainloop  on each loop i call for every NPC in the game ProcessAI to execute any actions.  This is a server so the call to ProcessAI is not executed on every frame like on a client game Its also singlethreaded.p  pNow i wanted to extend the C codebase with lua using luabind maybe, even with boost overhead. So i expose some functions of my NPC class to LUA.p  pI wanted to create actor scripts for example  boss battles which have more sophisticated behaviour  whenever in my c ProcessAI function an event happens  i would delegate this to the corresponding lua script for the specific NPC.p  pi imagined in my boss.lua script i would have something like thisp  precode function OnEngageCombatNPC  NPCsay Some taunts...  ScheduleEventCastEvilSpell,time2000,numExecutions1,  end   function CastEvilSpellNPC  NPCCastSpellsomeSpell  end codepre  pHowever  i have no idea how to do this  i gather ScheduleEvent should be some C function exported to Lua  but what would be the best approach to keep the object reference of the NPC boss with this and call a function in that script about 2 seconds later p  pFurthmore along with this delayed execution  i want that NPCs can interact with each other  my current idea is to have an actor behavior script for each special NPC.p  pNow what i imagined is to initiate a conversation between two NPCs e.g.p  precodefunction DoGossipNPC  check if NPC1 is close to NPC2 if NPCDistanceToNpcSomeGuy lt 10 then  StartConversation1 end  function StartConversation1NPC NPCSayHello ...  wait a moment now trigger NPC2 to reply  end codepre  pBasically  how do i call a function from lua scriptA which exists in lua scriptB which is the behavior script for NPC2.

Negative 538 pOk, this is a little hard for me to explain, so Im writing a program using MVVM model with WPF.p  pI have a grid on my main UserControl which requires the children to be updated by updated I mean created and destroyed dynamically through code as data is changed by the ViewModel I want the children of the Grid to be created and destroyed as needed.p  pIm pretty sure you cant dynamically create and destroy UIElements using only XAML, so I have  update functions in my view these update functions ONLY update the UI itself they do not change anything in the ViewModel, so therefore im not breaking MVVM because the code in the view only alters the UI based on the data in the ViewModel, so thats ok right.p  pRight now I am assigning the PropertyChanged event of my ViewModel within the View and catching that through code and firing the Update events, so my event in my View class looks like thisp  precode        private void ViewModelPropertyChangedobject sender, System.ComponentModel.PropertyChangedEventArgs e                      if e.PropertyName  BoardWidth  e.PropertyName  BoardHeight                 RecreateBoard              if e.PropertyName  Coordinates                 UpdateCoordinates              if e.PropertyName  TilesOnly                              UpdateBoardBlocks                 UpdateTiles                           if e.PropertyName  BoardBlockViewModels                 UpdateBoardBlocks              if e.PropertyName  TileViewModels                 UpdateTiles              if e.PropertyName  EntryPoint  e.PropertyName  CursorViewModel                 UpdateEntryPoint          codepre  pThe update events create  destroy children within the main grid of the view using code based on the data in the ViewModel. This current implementation works well.p  pBut, I would like to implement the event handler through XAML. So my question is how do I implement the event handler code above in XAML, I cant find any way of executing a Method within the view when a datacontext property changes. I have looked into DataTriggers but they dont contain the ability to execute the methods. Also the DataTrigger would need to fire when the property changes, not when it is set to a specific value.p  pI do not wish to push the updates through the ViewModel because this is STICTLY a View thing it has nothing to do with the viewmodel itself. eg. A different implementation of the View may not need to update in these circumstances. Even if I was to pus it through the ViewModel, the view itself would still have the same issue of how to execute the methods.p  pThankyou for your help.p

Negative 538 pIm looking for ideas on something simple to write that I can use to measure power. I just need it to make sure that my power measurement is working. Im using Xilinx ISE 14.1 on a Virtex6. Id like a simple circuit to write and to synthesize.p  pSo far I tried a 1K bit counter, but that wasnt really noticeable. I tried a 9K bit counter, but ISE had trouble synthesizing it I let it run for an hour before killing it. Now I am trying to implement large BRAMs and keeping them permanently enabled. p  pI need a way to restrict large vectors from getting optimized so Id like to xor all the bits together and feed the single bit output to an LED. Is there an easy way to do this for very large vectorsp
Negative 538 pI have a fairly simple Boost.Python extension that I am building with bjam. The problem is that the order that things happen in doesnt make sense to me, and I cant see how to fix it.p  pMy project consists of a root directory, with a Jamroot, and a single project subdirectory with a Jamfile, C file, header file, and Python script.p  pIn the root I have a Jamroot file that looks like this, largely scraped together from examples and the docs. It is separate from the projects Jamfile because I actually want to share this amongst several projects that will exist in other subdirectories.p  precodeimport python   if  [ python.configured ]      ECHO notice no Python configured in userconfig.jam      ECHO notice will use default configuration      using python    useproject boost    .boost   project    requirements ltlibrarygtboostpythonboostpython    A little rule function to clean up the syntax of declaring tests  of these extension modules. rule runtest  testname  sources        import testing      testing.maketest runpyd  sources   testname    buildproject helloworld   buildproject [[other projects]]...  codepre  pThen I have a subdirectory containing my helloworld project name changed to protect the innocent, which contains a Jamfilep  precodePROJECTNAME  helloworld   import python   pythonextension interpolationext    PROJECTNAME.cpp    ltdefinegtFOO    Put the extension and Boost.Python DLL in the current directory, so that running script by hand works. install convenientcopy    PROJECTNAMEext    ltinstalldependenciesgton ltinstalltypegtSHAREDLIB ltinstalltypegtPYTHONEXTENSION     ltlocationgt.      Declare test targets runtest PROJECTNAME  PROJECTNAMEext testPROJECTNAMEext.py  codepre  pThat convenientcopy sure is convenient, but I havent found much documentation about it, unfortunately.p  pAnyway, the idea is that while Im in the helloworld project directory, I make code changes and type bjam regularly. This has the effect of building the Python extension and then running the testhelloworldext.py file, which does an import helloworldext to test that the extension has built correctly, and then a bunch of rather trivial unittests. If they all pass, then bjam reports success.p  pemThe problemem seems to be that sometimes bjam runs the Python test strongbeforestrong it has run the convenientcopy rule, which means that it performs the test on the previous version of the extension, and then overwrites it with the new version. This means Im frequently having to run bjam twice. In fact, the second time bjam knows that something is outofdate because it actually does something. The third and subsequent time it does nothing until I make further source changes. Its like the classic doublemake problem when a dependency isnt correct.p  pThe main problem with this is that its often failing a successful build because the existing extension was bad, and other times it is showing a bad build as successful. It actually took me several weeks to notice this behaviour, around the same time I thought I was going insane, perhaps not coincidentally...p  pIt also seems to do this more often on Linux than OS X, but Im not completely sure. Feels that way though, and I divide my time between both environments fairly equally.p  pAlso, am I the only person who finds bjams jamfile syntax utterly confusing Theres a lot going on under the hood that I simply dont understand, or can find adequate documentation for. Id gladly use make or SCons instead but I wasnt able to get those working either due to broken examples here and there. What really confuses me is how bjam builds many, many other targets before getting on to my files, which would make writing a makefile quite tricky I think As I am quite familiar with GNU Make and SCons, emis it worth my time abandoning bjam to use one of those insteademp

Negative 538 pSo I have a codeListBoxcode that has a codeDataTemplatecode which has a Grid which has a codeRichTextBoxcode. For some reason when you type into the codeRichTextBoxcode it puts each character on a separate line. Digging into this, I find out that the codeExtentWidthcode is equal to 10.003. Why I have no idea. I was hoping someone could explain to me why and give a nice solution to make it stop doing this.p  pI did notice that if you set a width on the grids column, it fixes it, but I dont want a static width on my grids column.p  pBelow is an example of the problem.

Negative 538 pcodePostScriptcode books always suggest to carefully handle dictionaries. Separate user dictionaries and keep them small, close dictionary when it is no longer needed, avoid overloading global dictionary, etc.p  pHowever, I think, these instructions back to old ages where there were severe hardware limitation for memory. Closing a dictionary to free memory. The memory a PS script needs were probably comparable with the machine available memory. In modern time, the memory needed for a heavy codePostScriptcode task e.g. long document or complicated drawing is much lesser than the machine memory, and closing a dictionary with hundreds or even thousands of elements should have no significant effect on the machine performance.p  pCorrect me if Im wrong Consider that we put everything in one dictionary or global dictionary does it have a negative impact on the PostScript performancep  pDoes it still beneficial from performance point of view, not ease of coding to separate dictionary, and more importantly close them when not needed Or it just frees a tiny fraction of memoryp

Negative 538 pI have a screen that shows details of a Newspaper model instance. The ViewController of my screen has one property for this Newspaper model. A Newspaper instance contains several Article instances, and these Article instances must be represented as UIButtons in the screen. Tapping the UIButton must display an alert message containing the title of the Article.p  pWhat are some good ways to associate the UIButton with an Article model Basically, when tapping the UIButton, how do I retrieve the UIButtons corresponding Article instancep  pI currently have two approaches in mindp  ol liOverride the UIButton, and add a property for the Article instance.  ul liThis violates the MVC model, since the view UIButton has a direct means of communication with the model Article, but this will simplify button actions since the UIButton can simply call its property to know what Article instance will be used to do the action display an alert message containing the title of the Article.li ulli liCreate an NSArray of UIButtons buttonsArray, and an NSArray of Article instances articlesArray. ul liIndex 0 of the buttonsArray correspond to index 0 of the articlesArray. The Article instance associated with the tapped UIButton will be based on the buttons position in the array. In order to retrieve the corresponding Article of a UIButton, the buttonsArray must be looped until the tapped UIButton is found, and then getting the Article from the articlesArray using the same index.li ulli ol  pAre there better ways to achieve thisp  pEDIT The buttons will have animations and gesture recognizers. Also, the information needed by the button action from the Article model does not only include the title e.g. article position, or the object itself if it will be passed to another screen, etc..p

Negative 538 pSo I seem to have found myself in a bit of pickle. In order to keep a header flash element from reloading every time someone goes to a different page, I encapsulated all my sites content in an iframe. Unfortunately, some of the iframes include thickbox, which opens an iframe of its own. The iframe that thickbox opens, requires it be opened on the topmost page, so that the fixed attribute allows the iframe to remain static in the viewport. Because were already nested into an iframe, this isnt possible.p  pThis is the most promising lead I have so far a hrefhttpblog.codepyro.com201001thickboxinsideofthickboxiframe.html relnofollowhttpblog.codepyro.com201001thickboxinsideofthickboxiframe.htmlap  pUnfortunately, that only replaces the iframe that the thickbox is being opened from, with the content of the thickbox.p  pI also just came across this, but Im not sure how I would go about retooling it to suit my needs a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10406642openiframefancyboxfromwithinaniframesothatitopensintheparentopen iframe fancybox from within an iframe so that it opens in the parentap  pHere is a link to what Im working on a hrefhttpwww.lalalandmusicfestival.comsite relnofollowhttpwww.lalalandmusicfestival.comsiteap  pThe problem area is on the Talent page.p  pI think if there was a way to force the link to target the top or parent page with javascript, it may be possible, but I havent found anything thats been of any use to me yet.p  pThanks in advance for your helpp
Negative 538 pIm having these troubles since almost 2 full days now and see this as my last chance to get a neat solution of my 2pageeditor before giving up.p  pPlease use strongFirefoxstrong first and have a look at a hrefhttptwopageeditor.bastianschulz.com relnofollowhttptwopageeditor.bastianschulz.comap  pSTEPSp  ol liset the caret into the last row Exiles, similes, and revilesli lipress the down arrow keyli ol  pRESULT the caret is in the first row on page 2p  pShort explaination about the implementation  The editor contains two separate contenteditable DIV elements.   In case of leaving a page by moving with the cursor within an contenteditable DIV element, we just swap the places and positions of the DIV elements but the caret stays in the same DIV element. The page 2 which is on the left side, is still the same DIV element that was on the right side when we were still on page 1.  When changes to the text are done, the unselected DIV element is blurred out because it might be outofdate. When the selected DIV element is deselected again, its content is fully copied into the other DIV element so that all changes that have been done are kept and therefore synchronized with the other DIV element.p  pNow use strongChromestrong or strongSafaristrong IE not at all, that will be my next issue... STEPSp  ol liset the caret into the last row Exiles, similes, and revilesli lipress the down arrow keyli ol  pRESULT the caret is in the first row 1 on page 2p  pBUT this row is not visible. Press down arrow key again and it appears in the second row of page 2. When you press the arrow up key now, the content moves again, the caret is in row 1 and page 2 is displayed as it should and like Firefox does it correctly.p  pREASON right after you pressed the down arrow key on the first page you will see for a part of a second that content in this DIV is automatically scrolled by the browser so that the position of the caret is still visible. This causes a displacement of the DIV element by 20px of its CSS top attribute. When setting thereafter the new absolute value of top520px e.g. the height of the page  viewport is 520px this weird shifting of 20px is still there. p  pI havent figured out a way how to stop this automatic scrolling of the content when its not visible anymore. Or at least to be able to kind of reset the contenteditable DIV back to its normal state.p  pAnyone ideasp  pCheersp

I have the following codep  precoderequest.Data.SetTextmyString codepre  pHowever, when I select Share, Im presented with only the mail app.  What Im after is a way to launch a work processor e.g. MS Word from my app.  Is there something else that I need to do to mark the data Im sharing as compatible with Word  Or is this just not possible because Word is a desktop appp

Negative 538 pIm working on a project that has two different parts. Its an evoting system, so theres the part where voters vote, and theres the part where the admin can make changes like adding a new position, candidate, etc. I put these two parts in two different project folders called the client and the server. Each candidate has the URL of their picture, which is also stored on the server machine, which should be displayed to the client depending on which candidate is selected. The problem Im having is how to read the picture from the server into the client application. Any tips on the best location to store the files such that I can pass just the server name as a parameter to the client and its able to retrieve the file.p  pThe application uses MySQL, and Im so far assuming that the database server is the same as the application server.p  pAlso, I was wondering of the possibility of storing the file in the database itself, and if so, how practical that would be in terms of speed.p  pThanks.p

Negative 538 pI have an codeunorderedmapltstring, listltSomeClassgtiteratorgtcodep  pI want to insert an element in this map, but only if it does not exist already. If it exists, I dont want to overwrite the existing item. Also, I want to avoid doing two  lookups to check if the item exists and then for the insert. I came to the conclusion that I should use operator[] to get an element with the key, check if it is valid, and if not, initialize it. The problem is that the element is an iterator, and I have to check if it is initialized, which is not really possible. I can use a class that derives from teh list iterator class, and implement the defautl constructor to initialize it to an invalid value, but in the constructor I dont have access to the list instance to get its end iterator. Any ideas how to do itp

Negative 538 pI want to keep nogood scrapers aka. bad bots that by defintition ignores coderobots.txtcode that steal content and consume bandwidth off my site.  At the same time, I do not want to interfere with the user experience of legitimate human users, or stop wellbehaved bots such as Googlebot from indexing the site.p  pThe standard method for dealing with this has already been described here a hrefhttpwebmasters.stackexchange.comquestions19098tacticsfordealingwithmisbehavingrobotsTactics for dealing with misbehaving robotsa.  However, the solution presented and upvoted in that thread is emnotem what I am looking for.p  pSome bad bots connect through tor or botnets, which means that their IP address is ephemeral and may well belong to a human being using a compromised computer.p  pIve therefore been thinking about how to improve the industry standard method by letting the false positives i.e. humans that has their IP blacklisted get access to my website again. One idea is to stop blocking these IPs outright, and instead asking them to pass a CAPTCHA before being allowed access. While I consider CAPTCHA to be a PITA for legitimate users, vetting suspected bad bots with a CAPTCHA seems to be a better solution than blocking access for these IPs completely. By tracking the session of users that completes the CAPTCHA, I should be able to determine whether they are human and should have their IP removed from the blacklist, or robots smart enough to solve a CAPTCHA, placing them on an even blacker list.p  pHowever, before I go ahead and implement this idea, I want to ask the good people here if they foresee any problems or weaknesses I am already aware that some CAPTCHAs has been broken  but I think that I shall be able to handle that.p

Negative 538 pI was trying to copy the functionality of an existing WCF service library to use it as a template for a new WCF service library.  Since I was going to cut and paste all the code that I needed, and I didnt want it to create the default service stubs, I didnt start it by using the builtin WCF Service Library project template.  I just added a new blank project to my solution, using the Empty Project template.p  pI then created two new blank .cs code files to my project to hold the interface and class for my service, and copiedpasted the Interface and Class code from my original WCF service library project, and made the alterations that I needed to make.p  pThe new project compiles fine, however...p  p1 If I go into the project properties, the WCF Options section does not appear, as it does in my original WCF service library.p  p2 With the original WCF service libary project, I could rightclick on it and select DebugStart New Instance, and it would automatically start it using WCF Service Host.  With the new project, if I try that, it says, A project with an Output Type of Class Library cannot be started directly.p  pHow do I get Visual Studio Im using 2012 Professional to see this project as a true WCF class library, short of starting over and using the WCF Service Library project templatep

Because its not cool for the database accessing all ModelARate and getting rate ... I need to know also the lowest and the highest rate.p  pHow is the best way to achieve this in rails  without using a gem, I need to understand how it actually worksp  pI was thinking of adding a attribute ratescore in ModelA which is increasing when a ModelARate is created, and a method which return ratescore  modelarates.size For the lowest and highest rate, an attribute too  There is no mechanism that can do this for me in rails p  pThanks for any helpp

Negative 538 pIts my first question on StackOverflow, so please be gentle p  pIm using Cordova 2.4.0rc1 to upload camera pics to Amazon.

Now Im trying to do the same with my Cordovabased browserwithcamera.p  pI can get the camera to take a picture, and can get that resulting file URI, and then call fileEntry.file which gets me something that looks like a File object but is in fact just an object of type Object.p  pWhen I try to pass that filelike object to S3 direct uploader, I get the correct  of bytes uploaded to Amazon, but the actual file on Amazon is simply the text [object Object].p  pIs it possible for me to proceed in this direction Can I trick  WebView into creating a real file object that points to the actual picture Note for memory reasons, I dont want to load the picture into memory and then create a Blob. Or do I have to figure out how to get Cordovas File Uploader to CORS to Amazonp  pThanks in advance for your answers and suggestions on how I can improve my question.p

I click run as  android application... and to no surprise, nothing happens. No error message, no screen flash, no app on the device, nothing. So I tried to run it in an emulator. Not too clear how to set it up because the instructions are vague, but I got an emulator going and try to run again... nothing. No attempts to and then fails, no build errors.. no quick command prompt flashes, just nothing. The IDE just sits there as if I never clicked anything.

How can I prevent this from happeningp  pemEDITem The original version of this question suggested the blinking was happening during startup.  After further investigation, this is not occurring right at application startup rather, it occurs if I create an additional window while the application does not have focus.p  pTo give a bit more background my application is a sort of server, that opens windows in response to network events.  If I boot up the application, then switch focus to something else and a network event comes in while the focus is elsewhere, my application will open a new window in the background not grabbing focus and this blinking will occur.p  pThe windows are codewxFramecodes the application constructs them and their child widgets, then calls codeShowtruecode on the frame.p  pAlso, Ive attempted to set a breakpoint on the codeFlashWindowcode Win32 API function, hoping to trap wherever in WX its getting called, but havent been able to make that work.p
Negative 538 pI have been playing with Backbone.js for the past 2 months and I have successfully completed most of the example applications out there. Now, I have come across a topic that I cant seem to grasp so easily. Whenever I start building an application I have no problems sorting out my Backbone.js code, but when it comes to the REST API, I get lost. I have read many articles, tutorials, etc. I also attempted to build several applications following guides and tutorials using mongodb, node.js, express and backbone.js, but none of those have enlightened me. My main target is to develop smalltomedium datadriven single page applications. So, to cut to the chase, I recently came across ASP.NET Web API and I find it quite interesting. But I couldnt find any useful integration regarding Backbone.js  WEB API. Where would my Backbone.js code reside in the project if I use WEB API, considering that I am using gruntbbb as my build tool.p  pThank youp  pBest Regards,p

Negative 538 pI have a PHP script that runs a search on my database based on terms put into the search box on a website. This returns a block of text.  Lets say that my search term for right now is codetest blockcode.  An example of my result would be this block of textp  blockquote   pThis is a test block of text that was gathered from the database using   a search query.p blockquote  pstrongNow, my question isstrong how I can highlight the search term within the block of text so the user can see why this result was pulled in the first place.  Using the above example, something like the following would sufficep  blockquote   pThis is a strongtest blockstrong of text that was gathered from the database   from a search query.p blockquote  pI have tried a few things so far that will change the text, but the real problem I am running into has to do with case sensitivity.

This would look correct, as I wanted in my second example of the search result.  But, in the case that the user uses codeTest Blockcode instead of codetest blockcode, the search terms would be capitalized and appear as thisp  blockquote   pThis is a strongTest Blockstrong of text that was gathered from the database   from a search query.p blockquote  pThis does not work for me, especially when the user is using lowercase search terms and they happen to fall at the beginning of a sentance.p  pEssentially, what I need to do is find the word in the string, insert text codeltbgtcode in this example directly in front of the word, and then insert text directly after the word codeltbgtcode in this example while preserving the word itself from being replaced.  This rules codepregreplacecode and codestrreplacecode out I believe, so I am really stuck on what to do.p  pAny leads would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 538 pLet me try and make sense. I have a search page that returns lots of search results just like Google. Each of those search results have a trigger via an icon using onmouseover to access more info in a popup window that pops up to the right of all the search results, just like google. Here is what I want from the popup windowp  ul lipNo matter if I am looking at the first search result at the top of the page, or the last search result way down at the bottom of the page, I want the popup window to align itself with the top edge of the screen, regardless of where I am vertically on the page similar to fixedpli lipBUT, if the popup window happens to contain more data then the vertical screen height allows, instead of the popup window creating scrollbars internally, I want the popup window to scroll right along with everything else on the page similar to absolutepli lipThe problem is that fixed chops off data that goes below the bottom of the visible browser window height making it inaccesible without internal scrollbars. With absolute, the popup scrolls along with all the other stuff on the page which is great and what I want, but it always appears at the very top of the page, even when I am at the bottom of the page, making it invisible to the user if the results list is very long.pli ul  pIts like I am trying to combine the two methods in a way. So to summarizep  ul liWhen I trigger a popup via onmouseover, the popup window should affix itself to top edge always no matter where I am vertically, but if its content is vertically taller than the screen allows, I should be able to scroll the entire page down to see the rest of it. I should not have to use internal scrollbars within the popup window like fixed.li ul  pIs this possible and how should I go about it Thanks p

Negative 538 pQuick question hopefullyp  pI have a large dataset 100,000 records that I would like to use as a lookup to determine existence or nonexistence of multiple keys. The purpose of this is to find FK violations before trying to commit them to the database to try and avoid the resultant EDatabaseError messing up my transaction.p  pI had been using TClientDataSetTDatasetProvider with the FindKey method, as this allowed a clientside index to be set up and was faster 2s to scan each key rather than 10s for ADO. However, moving to large datasets the population of the CDS is starting to take far more time than the local index is saving.p  pI see that I have a few options for alternativesp  ul liclient cursor with TADOQuery.locate methodli liADO SELECT statements for each check no client cacheli liADO SEEK methodli liExtend TADOQuery to mimic FindKeyli ul  pThe Locate method seems easiest and doesnt spam the server with the SELECTSEEK methods. I like the idea of extending the TADOQuery, but was wondering whether anyone knew of any readymade solutions for this rather than having to create my ownp

I also download the mp3 to play locally in Google Play Music app for reference.p  pHTC One p  pStreaming from server  the stream will pause at one fixed position for every mp3 uploaded by iPod app. It is known that the MediaPlayer will 100 make another request at that point.br Play locally in Google Play  works perfectlyp  pGalaxy Nexus p  pStreaming from Server  MediaPlayer cannot play the mp3 and log error1,2147483648br Play locally in Google Play  cannot play and return a toast saying failure occursp  pSamsung Galaxy S4 p  pStreaming from Server  works perfectlybr Play locally in Google Play  works perfectlyp  pIt is suspected that the encoding of the mp3 in the iPod app causes the problem.

Negative 538 pI have the following R script running on my linux VPS that frequently returns errors thus interrupting the script. I am not sure how to program around the errors and was wondering if there was a way to force the script to continue to run despite them. The errors generally occur as out of bounds errors for the results table. The errors still occur when pasting the code directly into Rlt but when the out of bounds reference to the results table occurs, it stays at its previously set value of 0 and thus the code works as intended. Any help as to how to make this run automatically from linux command line example Rscript folderfile.R would be greatly appreciated.p  precodelibraryRMySQL librarytwitteR libraryplyr librarystringr

Negative 538 pIve got several python applications consisting of scriptsmodules that should be packaged and deployed as RPMs.p  pThe trickier bit is that each application should be distributed along with all python module dependencies, and these should be used in preference to any that are installed system wide.p  pThe target hosts for some of these RPMs have limited network access, so the RPMs should contain everything needed to run the app, rather than downloading anything at deploy time.p  pIve looked at packaging and distributing a a hrefhttpwww.virtualenv.orgenlatestvirtualenva, but relocating a virtualenv doesnt seem to be well supported.p  pIve looked at a hrefhttpwww.buildout.orgenlatestzc.buildouta, but found the documentation to be lacking. I could see how to download dependencies during development, but not how to distribute them as part of a larger application. Its possible different apps require different versions of the same module, so these shouldnt be installed system wide.p  pAnother pain point is that any python scripts in the app need to be modified to use a different sys.path during development and after deployment, I couldnt see an obvious way around this.p  pAre suggestions on how best to achieve this An ideal summary of the workflow from a developers point of view would look likep  ol lidownload application sourceli lirun script to fetch specific module dependencies if not present perhaps using a hrefhttpwww.pipinstaller.orgenlatestpipali lirun script to build python app, and package it and all downloaded dependencies into RPMli ol  pThe final RPM should then be installable and runnable on a host with no network access, and only a python interpreter installed.p
Negative 538 pI am exposing a webservice with multiple versions  1,2,3 and 4.I have to include a new optional element in 4th version of the webservice. Even though I have different versions of endpoint , all point to the same implementation logic. When I map the values to optional element introduced in 4th version , should I add a check in the implementation logic to ensure that value is mapped only if the request is hitting the 4th version of endpoint If I do not add such a check , my implementation logic will map the element to newly added element for requests coming in via all the endpoints. Will this result in any exception since other WSDLs do not have the optional element in response or will it work fine since it is an optional elementp

Negative 538 pI have developed a class so far that can represent a rubiks cube using a treemap best way each color is mapped to a key 0  53. the keys always stay the same and are represented by a 2D view of the cube. I made a rotate90 method that will take a color and rotate that colors face the middle cubies never move 90 degrees clockwise. So my question is, how do I implement a good search maybe A to get this cube to go in the right direction to its goalStatewhich I initialized as well in the code as a global so I can compare it to the current state. Any feedback or hints in the right direction would be great. Thanksp  pHere is the code without the rotate 90 method and a checkInput method that just checks if the file text is okay. The input is just a text file that represents the 2D cube and looks like this.

Negative 538 pI was wondering if it is possible to spawn each codeloop iterationcode each codeiterationcode into a codethreadcode by itself and finally collect the result. consider this example, nothing fancy in it at all.

Negative 538 pOk, so fgetc returns an unsigned char cast to int, and EOF at... EOF. What if youre trying to read in a config file to a char array, and your implementations char is signed The standard for C99 says that not only is the result implementationdefined to assign an unrepresentable value to a signed variable, but that the implementation can alternatively choose to raise a signal insteadp  blockquote   p6.3.1.3 Signed and unsigned integersp      pWhen a value with integer type is converted to another integer type other than Bool, if the value can be represented by the new type, it is unchanged.p      pOtherwise, if the new type is unsigned, the value is converted by repeatedly adding or     subtracting one more than the maximum value that can be represented in the new type     until the value is in the range of the new type.49p      pOtherwise, the new type is signed and the value cannot be represented in it either     the result is implementationdefined or an implementationdefined signal is raised. p blockquote  pConstructs like this are very commonp  precodeint c, i  0 char arr[1024]  for  c  getcDescriptor  EOF ampamp i lt sizeof arr  1 i          arr[i]  charc  arr[i]  0 codepre  pIts also implementationdefined to perform the cast if char is signed and the value in c is higher than can be represented.p  pI find it extremely unlikely that I have found a problem that thousands of programmers have missed over the years, especially with the ubiquitousness of the construct above.p  pIt seems that there is a possibility that nontext code read through this means could cause issues, since some of the bytes could have values that dont fit in a signed char. Ive never seen a modified version of the above construct that actually addresses this put to use.p  pHave I actually found a flaw relating to the C standard, or noticed something thousands of other programmers have not and failed to implement in their error checkingp
Negative 538 pI want to use protobufnet in my game engine and i come across this task  how can i efficiently differentiate between storage and runtime types p  pBasically, the way data is stored on disk will have different format and use then the one loaded at runtime.p  pSimplified example I have serialized some GPU related data into byte[], using a class something like thisp  precode[ProtoContractUseProtoMembersOnlytrue] public sealed class StoredData      [ProtoMember1]     public byte[] GpuData  codepre  pThen i would have a runtime implementation of this class, where i would upload that byte buffer to graphics card and therefore would have completely different type, something like class GraphicsBuffer not byte[].p  pAlso, when serializing the runtime type GraphicsBuffer i would want to serialize completely different message as well  for example a path on disk or name of StoredData to deserialize.p  pThat all boils down top  pHow do i interchange types used for serialization while having ability to define callback to convert between those types So that for examplep  p1.When i Serialize SoredData, a StoredData is writtenp  p2.When i Deserialize GraphicsBuffer, StoredData is deserialized and converted to GraphicsBufferp  p3.When i Serialize GraphicsBuffer, a buffer path message of that buffer is serializedp  p4.When i Deserialize buffer path message, buffer path message is deserialized, then StoredData is found and deserialized using that message, while deserialization of StoredData yields GraphicsBuffer created from information in StoredData.p  pI hope this makes some sensep

Negative 538 pIm trying to build a program that has certain requirements, the main being I have a class, and then make a subclass that adds a feature. I create the class DVD, and then I create the subclass.p  pIm adding a method to add the year to the list, as well as a restocking fee which will be added to the final inventory value that prints. I built the subclass, created the overriding methods, but it is not being added to the output displayed. Not only that, but it is placing the input year in the wrong place. I am not getting any errors, it just acts like the subclass doesnt exist, even though my DVD class says that some of the methods are being overridden. p  pIm thinking I must be missing something where I am supposed to call the new method, and maybe I read the resource wrong, but it sounded like I only needed to call the DVD class, and the methods I wanted overridden would be overridden automatically. Id prefer to just add this information to the superclass, but it is a requirement for an assignment.p  pSo Im wondering how do I actually go about calling these override methods when I need them to add these new features I keep seeing resources telling me how to create them, but not actually implement them.p  pFrom my main method, I call the dvd class and then print it. however, it only prints whats in the original dvd class, except for the odd addition of adding the year to where the product ID should be.p  precodepublic class DVD     String name int id int items double cost  default constructor public DVD      name       id  0     items  0     cost  0.0 end default constructor  constructor to initialize object public DVDString dvdName, int itemNum, int quantity, double price      name  dvdName     id  itemNum     items  quantity     cost   price end constructor   method to calculate value public double getInventoryValue         return items  cost   method to set name public void setdvdNameString dvdName     this.name  dvdName   method to get name public String getName     return name   method to set id public void setitemNum int itemNum     this.id  itemNum   method to get id public int getId     return id   method to set items public void setquantityint quantity     this.items  quantity      method to get items public int getItems     return items   method to set cost public void setprice double price     this.cost  price   method to get cost public double getCost     return cost        return    public String toString       return DVD Name   getName             ID   getId             Items   getItems             Cost   getCost              Total Value  getInventoryValue   codepre  pp  precodepublic class ExtendedDVD extends DVD double restockFee int year  public ExtendedDVD     year  0  public ExtendedDVDint year      this.year  year   public void setRestockFee     this.restockFee  0.05   public double getRestockFee     return restockFee    public void setYear     this.year  0   public int getYear     return year   Override public double getInventoryValue     double value1  super.getInventoryValue     double value  restockFee  value1     double totalInventoryValue  value  super.getInventoryValue     return totalInventoryValue   Override  public String toString     return super.toString  Year  getYear   codepre  pp  precodepublic class Inventory   DVD[] inventory  new DVD[5] int current  0 private int len  public Inventoryint len     inventory  new DVD[len]    public double calculateTotalInventory      double totalValue  0     for  int j  0 j lt inventory.length j           totalValue  inventory[j].getInventoryValue     return totalValue        param dvd   throws Exception   public void addDVDDVD dvd throws Exception      if current lt inventory.length          inventory[current]dvd     else          Exception myException  new Exception         throw myException            void sort        for DVD inventory1  inventory          len  current             for int i0 iltleni          forint jijltlenj              if inventory[i].getName.compareToinventory[j].getNamegt0                  DVD temp  inventory[j]                 inventory[j]  inventory[i]                 inventory[i]  temp                                   public int getNumberOfItems      return current        public void printInventory      System.out.printlnCurrent Inventory     forint i0iltcurrenti          System.out.printlninventory[i]          System.out.printlnThe total value of the inventory iscalculateTotalInventory       codepre  pp  precodepublic class inventoryprogram1      param args the command line arguments   public static void mainString[] args       boolean finish  false     String dvdName     int itemNum     int quantity     double price     int year  0      Inventory inventory  new Inventory5     while finish          Scanner input  new ScannerSystem.in  Initialize the scanner         System.out.printPlease enter name of DVD          dvdName  input.nextLine         if dvdName.equalsstop              System.out.printlnExiting Program             break          else              System.out.printPlease enter Product Number              itemNum  input.nextInt             System.out.printPlease enter units              quantity  input.nextInt             System.out.printPlease enter price of DVD              price  input.nextDouble             System.out.printPlease enter production year              itemNum  input.nextInt              DVD dvd new DVDdvdName,itemNum,quantity,price              try                inventory.addDVDdvd             catch Exception e                  System.out.printlnInventory is full.                 break                           System.out.printlnDVD   dvd          end else              inventory.sort        inventory.printInventory   codepre

Negative 538 pIm looking for a really lightweight and simple ORM for php. I had a look at propeldoctrine as part of symfony and it is just way to complicated for my needs. I am not doing any sort of MVC model and I dont want to use any other frameworks. I have looked at fuelphp and similar for examplep  pThe best I could see was NotORM but I was concerned that there didnt seem to be much documentation or any sort of active forum. It seemed neglectedp  pCan anyone recommend an ORM suitable for my needs please  i want a set of classes for getting individual rows or groups of rows. I would like query classes with query methodschaining that can traverse relationships. I dont need an MVC framework. I would also like to be able to have classes generated for views. I would also like to be able to run my own custom sql queries if the classes wont let me do what I want and possibly stored procedures. Good documentation and examples are also a plus I would be using NOT ORM now if i ad been able to find more tutorialsp  pI Just something to avoid my having to write prepared statements and concatenate sql queries myself. Also something with support and an active forum would be the nice  The shallowest learing curve in the world would also be nice. Im used to using .net wrappers and they are really easy. I can jut create the classes without needing all this surrounding framework like symfony which i dont knowp  pI think i also say this but it looked old and unsupported. However that would suit my needs  a hrefhttpwww.schizofreend.nlPork.dbObject relnofollowhttpwww.schizofreend.nlPork.dbObjectap  pMany thanks in advance for sharing your wisdom and expertisep

Negative 538 pIm trying to make a pinballstyle game for a school project for the Android in the SDK in Eclipse.p  pTheres a really weird and super frustrating problem in which objects are moving without any code telling them to. Basically, each Wall instance contains 4 Line objects which are used for collision detection with the Ball.  These Lines work the first time, but as soon as the ball collides with them once, then that Line somehow moves to another position on the screen. Ive been debugging it, and wouldnt ask if I hadnt already tried everything, but there is honestly no reason for the Line to shift anywhere. The way I handle a collision is by pushing the Ball to be 1px away from the wall, and then given new dx and dy velocities to move away. The code for checking for collisions is below, followed by the function that handles a collision to change the balls position and velocity.

Negative 538 pOK, I have a Jenkins Master on CentOS and  I use it to run a bunch of windows slaves with installed java services and that runs flawless. Now I have a new windows server in DMZ so I cannot use the Java webstart. I have installed Cygwin SSH on the server and I can use SSH to connect to it with Putty, so that end seems to work.p  pIn Jenkins I have installed SSH Plugin, SSH Slave plugin and SSH Credentials plugin. Remote FSroot is Cjenkins as I read somewhere Launch method is Launch slave agents on unix machines with SSH Host dmzaddress.domain Credentials Global cred with User password. the credentials that works with puttyp  pI cannot see a log and in the node list there is just a message that there was a time out. So even if I can reach the slave with SSH, Jenkins cannot and I suspect that I have missed something.p

I wrote a little script like this at the beginning of my viewp  precodeltscriptgt function displayMessage    alertSync is about to start blabla   syncStarted.show   ltscriptgt codepre  pThen a little hidden paragraphp  precodeltp idsyncStarted, styledisplaynonegtltstronggtltfont colorgreengtSynchronisation has started, please wait...ltfontgtltstronggtltpgt codepre  pAnd I call my function like thisp  precodelt linkto Synchronise, controller gt projectusers, action gt dropboxsync, id gt p, projectid gt project.identifier, class gt icon iconreload, onclick gt displayMessage gt codepre  pI know this is not a really good RubyRails way to implement JS and that my html is pretty obsolete CSS would be much better, but its working pretty well. The only problem with this is that the user has no choice, if he clicks on the link, the sync will start even if he closes the popup by clicking the cross.p  pMaybe could you help me to find the better way to do that, I think the use of the codeconfirmcode parameter is better but I could not find how to add a little notification on my page after the user confirms the action.p  pIm working with Rails v3.2.16.p  pThanksp

Negative 538 pI am not sure if amazon simply does not offer graphics for linux vm instances or if its to do with configuration. But i recently setup a linux node on ec2 and i tried to setup rdp. I kept getting a blank screen but after much trial and error, went with bizspark and setup a linux node and to my surprise I see the bizspark linux node comes with a vga graphics card while the amazon one does not p  pWithout a vga graphics card or builtin chipset its not possible to rdp in the linux node.  So does amazon offer graphics card on linux vms or is it a simply a matter of configuration  p  pedit  It is possible to have rdp even without a graphic card apparently. What I found out is one can install X2GO server on their ubuntu server and then just get the x2go client. No need for rdp.p

Negative 538 pHi I have a regex on an email field which works fine in most scenarios but is failing in a weird situation. Following is the regex that I am usingp  precodew[.]ww[.]w.w[.]w codepre  pand following are the two similar looking email addresses on which I am testing the regex. p  precodeglobaldonotreplyabc.com globaldonotreplyabc.com codepre  pDo not be confused with the visible text as it looks the samep  pStrangely the regex fails on 1 of the email addresses. The reason I have figured out is that when I wrote the email address donotreplyabc.com in Evernote and pressed enter, it changed it into a link. but if you add another text global to the email address after its being changed into a link, then the newly added text will not be treated as a part of the email address. I checked the complete email address in Notepad and found that Evernote MS Word does the same too has added a nonprintable character at the beginning of the email address and the text I added to the email address later after Evernote changed the text into the link is appearing before the non printable characters. Which seems to be the reason. But I am not sure as to how to handle it using regex or using any other method. I am working on ASP.Net Webformsp

That data is then put into a mysql database, and the user can then use their username and password to login on the a hrefhttpteacherhelp.comuf.comsignin.html relnofollowlogin pagea. Without being logged in, the user is not able to enter the main section of the site.p  pThe idea is to be able to have the user register a username, password and full name, and then for them to be able to login using the username and password.p  pI would like to use the same interface as the pages I linked to above for it.p  pI would really appreciate some help with this.p  pEdit Thanks for the help It is working greatp

Also consider the pointer ptr.

Negative 538 pI will explain my situation so that my question makes more sense.p  pI am programming a game using python and pygame. It is a pretty minimalist game without a lot of graphics, and I want each level to be a grid of either black or white squares. I think it makes a lot more sense to have each level be defined as a string of 1s and 0s like sop  precode0000 0101 1010 1111 codepre  pas opposed top  precodelevel1  pygame.Rect0, 0, 100, 100, pygame.Rect100, 0, 100, 100, pygame.rect200, 0, 100, 100, pygame.rect300, 0, 100, 100, ... ... codepre  pand so on and so forth for every single rect. The second way is clunky and awkward, and would make it very difficult to design the levels. Also in python, readability counts, and beautiful is better than ugly. p  pI am planning on using the first way, and having a function that returns a list of pygame.Rect objects similar to the code above where the 0s are black tiles, and the 1s are white tiles. Unfortunately though, pygame.Rect objects dont contain any data about what color they are.p  pNow my question is twofold.p  p1 Is it possible to add an attribute to an existing class In this example, adding the attribute rect.color without going into the source code of the module it came from and changing it yourself Becuase that seems like a REALLY bad idea.p  p2 If the above is possible, is it wise Or are you just shooting yourself in the footp  pUnderstand of course, I realize that this is not the only way to accomplish what I want. If I wanted to do it the tried and true way, I would create a class like sop  precodeclass tile     def initself, x, y, width, height, color         self.rect  pygame.Rectx, y, width, height         self.color  color      def drawself         pygame.draw.rectdisplaysurface, self.color, self.rect codepre  pThis is definitely the obvious way, and works for what I need just fine. But, I would like to know whether or not this is possible. If it is, it seems like it could be very useful in certain situations.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOkay, I took shiplu.mokadd.ims advice and tried using setattr, but that only works with classes that I have defined myself, not imported classes. Here is an examplep  precodeclass pet     def initself, name, species         self.name  name         self.species  species  fido  petFido, Dog setattrfido, breed, Golden Retriever  print fido.breed codepre  pwhich outputs Golden Retriever as expected. However this examplep  precodeimport pygame  pygame.init  rect  pygame.Rect0, 10, 20, 30  setattrrect, color, BLACK print rect.color codepre  poutputs this error.p  precodeTraceback most recent call last   File game.py, line 7, in ltmodulegt     setattrrect, color, BLACK AttributeError pygame.Rect object has no attribute color codepre  pI realize that I should just do thisp  precodeclass ColoredRectRect     def initself, color, ...         self.color  color         superColoredRed, self.initself, ... codepre  pbut is it empossibleem to add an attribute the way Ive been tryingp  pAlso, I hope that whoever reviews the Possible Duplicate questions, realizes that Im not trying to add a method... p

Negative 538 pI am creating an MVC3 web app. It has a series of cascading dropdowns and related buttons. Depending on what the dropdowns are set to and which buttons the user presses, many different things can be displayed. So far in my view I have added each of these possibilities in a div tag and then using javascript I have hidden or shown them as needed. This has created one giant view that is kind of unmanageble.br Lately I have come across partial views in my research. I think I might be able to just save each of the possibilities that can be shown into partial views and then just have a particular partial view be shown based on the button presses. However, from research, this doesnt seem to be what partial views are meant for. p  pShould I keep using divs that I hideshow as needed, or are partial views a better choice, or is there a better solution that I havent thought offoundp

Negative 538 pIve made a really simple singleuser database application with web2py to be deployed to a desktop machine.

The problem is that I have not managed how to insert these correctly into the upload folder, as the web2py engine automatically changes the filename of the users uploads to a safe format, and copying my files straight to the folder does not work.p  pMy question is, does anyone know a proper way to include this image collection into the uploads folder.

Negative 538 pI have a table that stores statistics about the number of records added to a different table in the same database over a period in time.p  pThis is a simplified schema of the stats table.p  precode   id    programId    start    end   count    codepre  pIRL the table contains multiple counts, and dates that are computed using a moderately complex query.  Each codeprogramIdcode will exist in the table with an codeendcode value of codenullcode, and that is where the stats are stored for the given program.  A cron job runs to periodically close the time slice i.e. set the codeendcode column to a valid date.  The next time the stats are updated new program rows are created with a codestartcode value, and codeendcode set to null.p  pThis is a simplified schema of the message table, it contains the data that gets summarized in the stats table. This table holds the data that gets summarized in the stats table.p  precode   id    messageId   programId    time    codepre  pId like to update all of the program message counts with a single query.  The following query doesnt work because the aggregate function codemaxcode isnt allowed in the where statement.  Also, Ive read warnings about using the codecoalescecode function in the where clause.  Also, it just seems strongwrongstrong to have the same two tables joined over and over again in a single query.  Im no sql expert obviously, but this query raises all kinds of red flags with me  even if it worked, Id be posting here looking for ways to improve it.p  precodeUPDATE stats a INNER JOIN messages b on a.programId  b.programId SET a.numberReceived        SELECT COUNTc.id        FROM messages c LEFT JOIN stats d ON c.programId  d.programId        WHERE c.datetime gt coalescemaxd.end, 19700101 000001      WHERE end IS NULL codepre  pThe logic is to only count the messages that have arrived after the last closed time slice if one exists, otherwise count all the messages for the given program i.e. if this is the first time the program appears in the stats table.p  pI tried adding this counting logic to a trigger, however, there are more stats being computed than this which is a simplified example and many rows are inserted into the messages table at a time.  The upshot was that including this logic in an codeafter insertcode trigger caused transaction errors, which led to the insert failing.p  pI know I could do this programmatically by looping through the programs and issuing many sql statements against the DB, but think this can be done in a single statement.p

My approach makes it a little bit more complicated but the problem persists even if I only used the simple locks. I cant or dont want to block signals if an codelock.acquirecode is blocking on IO and although I can start blocking signals right after acquiring a lockp  precodeserverslock.acquire theres a gap right here where the program could receive a signal and the undo info would be in an inconsistent state with suspendedsignalsSIGNAMES this uses the pysigset python package     find and lock a server    set up global undo info for an atexit handler Reallow signals right after my global info for atexit is in ordder  codepre  pAny advice on how to solve this Is there something like a semaphore version of the codepselectcode system function, which would allow me to start blocking signals atomically right upon returning from codeacquirecode, should I use codesysvipccode and its codeSEMUNDOcode functionality instead of codeposixipccode or something completely differentp

Negative 538 pWhat I mean by forkable iterator  it is a regular iterator with method codeforkcode which creates a new iterator which iterates from the current point of iteration of original iterator. And even if the original iterator was iterated further, fork will stay at the point where it was forked, until it itself will not be iterated over.p  pMy practical use case I have a socket connection, and some packets that sent through it. Connection can be shared between receivers and each packet can be addressed to some receiver. Packets can come in unordered way, so each receiver can potentially receive packet for different recevier. And more than that  if one receiver received packet for different recevier, this different receiver must still be able to read that packet.   p  pSo for that I want to implement such forkable iterator, which will represent the connection, and each receiver will make own fork, read it and search for packets addressed for it.p  pDoes somebody know any implementations of what Im talking aboutp

It is running on a digital ocean droplet with a mongohq now compose.io database.

Negative 538 pI am using WooSlider to display a gallery for each project of mine. Many of my projects are in HD aspect ratio 1280x720 while other older ones are SD 720x540.p  pThe problem I am having is that I would like to make my site width 1280px wide but since WooSlider sets its size according to the website width, the SD images would be enormous in vertical height around 960px. The HD images look fine since they remain at 1280x720px.p  pSince I cannot restrict the width of the slider as 1280 works great for HD images, I thought perhaps its possible to restrict the height of the slider so that it will crop the gigantic SD images. Cropping would be ok so long as the SD images stay centered within the crop. But I would need the slider to remain responsive so a fixed height wont do.p  pSo is this possible To restrict the maximum height of WooSlider, while still allowing it to be responsivep  pAlternately, if I could check the width of the slider images, I could possibly restrict the height only when images are in SD format, while leaving the HD ones unaffected.p  pHere is an example of my website at 1024px wide, displaying SD images. As you can see, even at 1024px, the vertical height of the scaled SD images in the slider is very large so at 1280px it would be enormousp  pa hrefhttprichardrosenman.comportfolioitemskraftdinnerpimpmyride relnofollowhttprichardrosenman.comportfolioitemskraftdinnerpimpmyrideap  pAny suggestions or info welcome.p

The given password is now hashed using bcrypt, so it is a string of hashed bytes.p  pbr p  h2Verifyingh2  pNow, heres the part that confuses me to check that a plaintext password matches a hashed password, the emsameem function is used, using the hashed password as a saltp  precodeif bcrypt.hashpwpassword, hashed  hashed     printIt Matches else     printIt Does not Match  codepre  pbr p  h2Whats happeningh2  pShouldnt the results of both codebcrypt.hashpwcode calls be different, since the input salts are different  p  pThe only reasonable answer I can think of is that the salt is truncated to a fixed length before being prepended to the hashed password.  That way, when using the result of the hash, only the generated salt is left after stripping off the trailing hashed password, and the result of hashing the password with the truncated salt is the same as the original.

Negative 538 pAll,p  pI am migrating existing Worker Role code to an Azure Web job. I am trying to use the WebJob SDK 1.0 so that I have the full integration with the Azure Web Site.p  pMy difficultly is that the JobHost doesnt play nicely with jobs that are outside its usual Attribute based invoke options Queues, Blobs etc.p  pI already have standard code that I cannot change to listen to Azure QueuesTopics etc. so I cannot use the WebJob code to do this.p  pTherefore I need to use the WebJob Call methodp  precodevar cancelTokenSource  new CancellationTokenSource var onStartMethod  typeofProgram.GetMethodOnStart, BindingFlags.Static  BindingFlags.Public  host.CallAsynconStartMethod, cancelTokenSource.Token     .ConfigureAwaitfalse     .GetAwaiter     .GetResult codepre  pNB I am using my own CallAsync as all the advice is to use ConfigureAwaitfalse when using libraries but the innards of JobHost doesnt do this, so Im replicating its call code myself but with the ConfigureAwait. The cancellation token doesnt do anything in JobHost as far as I can tell.p  pMy problem is that I then need to call host.RunAndBlock to stop the job exiting, which is fine, but then I need to run some clean up processing. I cant make a new call to CallAsync with an OnStop method, as the Host is already being cancelled, so all I can do is make a direct call to my OnStop method. Unfortunately then I lose the ability to write to the WebSite log through the provided TextWriter class.p  pI think what I need is a way for JobHost to invoke my method within RunAndBlock, so I can then pick up the cancellation token fired when the host is shutting down, and then perform my cleanup code.... but there doesnt seem any way to do this.p  pIs there an obvious way I am missing JobHost seems really poor at handling scenarios outside its norm p

Negative 538 pIm reading and parsing CSV files into a SQL Server 2008 database. This process uses a generic CSV parser for all files.p  pThe CSV parser is placing the parsed fields into a generic field import table F001 VARCHARMAX NULL, F002 VARCHARMAX NULL, Fnnn ... which another process then moves into real tables using SQL code that knows which parsed field Fnnn goes to which field in the destination table. So once in the table, only the fields that are being copied are referenced. Some of the files can get quite large a million rows.p  pThe question is does the number of fields in a table significantly affect performance or memory usage Even if most of the fields are not referenced. The only operations performed on the field import tables are an INSERT and then a SELECT to move the data into another table, there arent any JOINs or WHEREs on the field data.p  pCurrently, I have three field import tables, one with 20 fields, one with 50 fields and one with 100 fields this being the max number of fields Ive encountered so far. There is currently logic to use the smallest file possible.p  pId like to make this process more generic, and have a single table of 1000 fields Im aware of the 1024 columns limit. And yes, some of the planned files to be processed from 3rd parties will be in the 9001000 field range.p  pFor most files, there will be less than 50 fields.p  pAt this point, dealing with the existing three field import tables plus planned tables for more fields 200,500,1000 is becoming a logistical nightmare in the code, and dealing with a single table would resolve a lot of issues, provided I dont give up much performance.p

Negative 538 pIm trying to build a very specific search page for a project and Im having lot of trouble dealing with multiple postbacks invoked by dynamicallygenerated controls on a single page.p  pThe page has to work like thisp  ul lipThere is a single checkbox, strongDetailed searchstrong, that causes a postback on checkingunchecking.p  ul lipWhen detailed search is not active, a simple grid with contents and buttons is displayed. Nothing special.pli lipWhen detailed search is active, strongNstrong checkboxes must be generated from some dynamic data, that represent the sections where you want the search to happen. Below the checkboxes, an AJAXenabled tab control will appear, initially with no tab pages.p  ul liWhen checking one of the section checkboxes, a postback will occur. After the postback, data will be searched in the section selected by  the user, then a new tab page containing a stronggrid viewstrong of results and the name of the section will be added to the tab control. If the checkbox is unchecked, the tab page will disappear from the control, again, after a postback.li ulli ulli ul  pNow, the issue is that pretty much everything has to be generated dynamically, and that pretty much everything is connected to something else.p  pFirst issue dealing with the strongDetailed searchstrong checkbox. Sounds easy, doesnt it My initial idea was to set codePage.Viewstate[DetailedSearchEnabled]code to codetruecode or codefalsecode during the checkuncheck event handler, then create controls dynamically checking the value of codeDetailedSearchEnabledcode during codePageLoadcode. p  pstrongNope.strong The postback eventhandling happens between codePageLoadcode and codePageLoadCompletecode. It would take an strongadditional refreshstrong for things to work as intended.p  pemltlt Then Ill just generate the controls on codePageLoadCompletecode emp  pstrongNope.strong Those controls need event handling as well, and if theyre generated after codePageLoadcode they will not be wired up correctly.p  pA possible solution would be generating everything in advance, on codePageLoadcode, and only hidingshowing controls on codePageLoadCompletecode. But that is inefficient, and one important point of this search page is that only the minimum amount of controls should be generated.p  pThe difficulty of this task seems to come from the way event wiring and the page life cycle work. p  pSurely there must be a better way of approaching this problem.p

Negative 538 pNew to angularjs. I have a simple controller which reads a json file using codehttp.getcode. Inside codegetcode I am assigning some values to variable codescope.testTotalcode. But they revert to default value when exiting codehttp.getcode. It is confusing that when I log the entire object to console, I can see the values but when logging a specific value it shows zero.

Negative 538 pI had been using Scalariform in a project I upgraded to Scala 2.11.

This makes the usual sbt crossversion dependency unhappy.p  pAs 2.11 has been out for a while already, this has me questioning if the usage of Scalariform as an embedded library should be considered abandoned Has the community moved on to an alternative I just dont know aboutp

Negative 538 pI am trying to cast an object to its superclass using Java.lang.Class.cast but I get the same object.

But I want codecastedObjcode to be a new object of dynamic type A because the codeparsecode method relies on that fact iterates on the fields of the dynamic type class.p
Negative 538 pThis is my first time asking a question here but I have a problem that I really cant wrap my head around which is Prolog recursion especially when it deals with list. So the task that I am supposed to solve is to write a drop predicate that works like this. For example, codedrop[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], 2, Lcode where codeL  [1,3,5,7,9]code and codeNncode where elements at position n, 2n, 3n.... will be removed. The list starts from 1 is another thing to be noted. p  pHere is my attempt so far and thought process p  precodedrop[], , [].  indexOf[X], X, 1. Using 1 because the question says the first element starts from 1.  indexOf[Ys], Y , I     indexOfYs, Y, N,     I is N  1.  drop[XXs], Y, [X]      indexOf[XXs] , X , A,     Z is A mod Y,     Z  0.  drop[XXs], Y, Zs      indexOf[XXs], X, A,     dropXs, Y, Zs. codepre  pI created an codeindexOfcode predicate to find the index of the elements starting from 1 . Next, my idea was to use the my first drop recursive case in the code above it is the 5th case to check and see whether the position of the element returns a remainder of zero when divided by the codeYcode second input. if it does not return a remainder of zero, then the codeXcode remains inside the list and is not dropped. Then, prolog moves on to the 2nd drop recursive case which can only be arrived when codeZ0code and it will drop codeXcode from the list to return codeZcodes. In essence, an element with index n, 2n, 3n... that is returned by codeindexOfcode will be dropped if it does not return a remainder of zero when divided by codeYcode second input.p  pI have not learnt Cut at this point of the course at the moment.

Negative 538 pI have a GridView where each cell is a thumbnail, a filename and a checkbox. To populate the grid I use a CustomCursorAdapter The CustomCursorAdapter extends CursorAdapter.p  pI have a floating button that launchs the system camera. If I take a picture, the grid updates correctly with the new cell.p  pIn the action bar I have a delete button. If I check one or more checkboxes and press the delete button the cell isare correctly deleted.p  pBut then I have also a ShareActionProvider button so you can check multiple cells and share them. And that works. BUT, here comes the problem. Imagine we have 3 or 4 cells. You check a couple of them, share them, and when you come back from the sharing dialog you see all the cells and you can see how all of them fade and disappear but one, the upper leftmost one. p  pI checked and saw that after the sharing dialog is the onResume method the one executed. The only thing Im interested to be done in that method is to reset the checkboxes a selected.clear of the variable and a cb.setCheckedfalse of each Checkbox view. Also I set the intent of the ShareActionProvider  button for a empty selection this will trigger a Toast Select first the images to share if the button is pressed now.p  precodeOverride   public void onResume        if shared  we come from a share         uncheck unchecks the Checkboxes views         selected.clear reset the selected items list          getShareIntent returns an intent with the items in          selected now empty as extras         Intent intent  this.getShareIntent         if intent  null ampamp mShareActionProvider  null          mShareActionProvider.setShareIntentIntent.createChooserintent,                                      getResources.getTextR.string.sendto                  shared  false          super.onResume  codepre  pRemoving the unchecking, reset and new intent setting dont affect to that behaviour, the cells disappear anyway. In fact, if I comment the whole onResume function the problem remains.p  pI tried with things likep  precode grid.invalidateViews  mAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged  grid.setAdaptermAdapter codepre  pAlso tried and put the super as the first line, but then checkboxes, intent and list variable arent updated. p  pAnother clue is that if I press the thumbnail of the unique cell left visible this loads a new activity to see the picture big size, then the disappeared cells appear for a second while the new activity is loading. oOp  pI tried to press the places where the thumbnails should appear after the share to check if it launches the big display activity anyway, but that doesnt happen. p  pI read about similar things when scrolling GridViews but I just have three elements, no need to scroll. What could be happening herep  pEDIT To check if the issue was related to the memory and the thumbnails, I commented them in the item views, letting just the textview and the checkbox. But the problem is still there. Absolutely desperate Ive been days trying to fix thisI tried to relaunch the grid activity in the onResume, to try to force the redraw while mAdapter.notifyDataSetChanged worked when adding a new cell, never worked after the sharingp  precodeOverride public void onResume          super.onResume     if shared          shared  false         Intent intClearStack  new Intent                 getBaseContext,                 GridActivity.class         intClearStack                 .setFlagsIntent.FLAGACTIVITYNEWTASK                          Intent.FLAGACTIVITYCLEARTASK         startActivityintClearStack         finish     t  codepre  pIm not proud of this solution but is the nearest thing I found to fix this. Nearest because, while it works almost all the time, ocasionally it doesnt. Id like to know why theres a difference when it comes back from a ShareActionProvider activity and any other activity, to try to find out why this is acting like that. p

Negative 538 pI am just beginning the exciting journey towards learning Javascript, and in one of my lessons I am being asked to build a voidLastTransaction method to add to my virtual cash register. I have written out the code, which allows the user to void the amount from the last transaction. However, I would like to know how to do it to void the last two transactions, rather than one. I suppose calling the function after each transaction I want voided is one way of doing it but I am wondering if there is a more dynamic way of resetting the property that stores the amount of the last transaction so that it changes to the value of the previous transaction on the list, which would become the next last transaction once the last transaction has been deducted. Below is my current code. Thanks in advance p  precodevar cashRegister   total 0, lastTransactionAmount 0, add functionitemCost     this.total  itemCost    this.lastTransactionAmount  itemCost , scan functionitem, quantity  switch item    case eggs this.add0.98  quantity break   case milk this.add1.23  quantity break   case magazine this.add4.99  quantity break   case chocolate this.add0.45  quantity break   return true ,   voidLastTransaction function    this.total  this.lastTransactionAmount   this.lastTransactionAmount  0     cashRegister.scaneggs, 1 cashRegister.scanmilk, 1 cashRegister.scanmagazine, 1 cashRegister.scanchocolate, 4    I want to void the last 2 transactions console.logyour bill is  cashRegister.total codepre

Negative 538 pIm building a Laravel application that has listings. These listings can be things like boats, planes, and automobiles each with their own specific fields.p  pI will also have an images table that should relate to each type of listing and a users table that needs to map to each type of listing. Im trying to determine the best way to map each listing type back to codeimagescode and codeuserscode.p  pOne way Ive thought of doing this was having separate codeboatscode, codeplanescode and codeautomobilescode tables with their specific fields and then having specific codeboatimagescode codeplaneimagescode and codeautomobileimagescode tables to map to each respective type. But then relating each type to a user would be a bit tricky.p  pI dont think one giant listing table with all fields Id ever use through these 3 which could grow in size later would make sense  and I also dont believe having a general metadata field that has a JSON object full of specifications for each listing would work well either when I want to have a searchable database.p  pI know of a hrefhttplaravel.comdocs4.2eloquentworkingwithpivottables relnofollowpivot tablesa, but Im trying to grasp the overall architecture here.

Negative 538 pI file email conversation threads to various folders. But with every new email in that conversation, it goes to inbox, and I have to manually move it to the folder that contains the rest of the conversation. Is there a way for Outlook to do this automatically with all new emailsp  pPseudocode Outlook will do the following automatically as long as its running for all unread emails in inbox. If email is not the first in the conversation, Outlook searches for folders where that conversation is stored. First folder except for Inbox, Trash, or Sent it finds, it moves the new email to that folder keeping it unread.p  pIf there is more than one folder containing messages in the same conversation, then do nothing.
