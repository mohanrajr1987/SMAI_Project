Positive 2149 pI wonder if there is a cheap way to get a faster compile times for scala in order to use it for learning the language by writing simple scripts. When you learn new language it gets really hard to wait 8 seconds after each typo you made and there are hundreds of typos as you are newbie.p  pCan scala compiler compile faster by disabling certain Java classes or other parts of a compiler or JVM that may be irrelevant for basic language learning usage scenariop

Positive 2149 pWe are facing a strange issue related to minor GC. One of our application which is in production since last 18 months started having higher minor gc pauses times recently. Historically our minor GC pauses were around 3050 msec, however now they are around 110 msec to 400 msec. There has not been any changes in heap configurations but good number of code changes has gone in.p  pThe application is a Rest web service running on tomcat hosted on a cloud with 8 cpu virtual machines and 24 GB RAM and talking to cassandra. We tried to recreate the issue for debugging the same in a lower environment by running a performance test but not able to do so. There is a single rest service which is invoked with similar workload with 98 of the time however 2 of the workload is bit different. We are not able to load test those 2 of the calls due to data issues.p  pWhen we run the load we see that almost same amount of heap is reclaimed or promoted as in normal scenario load is 810 times of production when we run the load test but minor gc pauses are lt50 msec always. we did run the same load on a production VM as its a read operationp  pWith Performance test requestsHigh loadp

Positive 2149 pI will be hosting my Cassandra database on Google cloud. Instances are priced in a linear fashion meaning 1cpu with 2gb ram is 1, 2cpu with 4gb is 2, 4cpu with 8GB is 4 and so on. p  pI am deciding on the size of my instances and am not sure what the standard is I was thinking of using more fewer larger instances 8cpu, 64gb opposed to lighter such as 2cpu, 4 gb. My thought process is with more instances each node will carry less of the overall data which would have a smaller impact if nodes fail. As well, the os of these smaller instances would have less overhead because it would accept less connections. p  pThese are pros, but here are some cons I can think of 1 Each instance will be less utilized 2 Cassandra  JVM overhead on so many instances can add up and be a lot of overhead. 3 I will be using local SSD opposed to persistent SSD which are much more expensive meaning each instance will need their own local SSD which raises costs.p  pThese are some reasons I can think of, is there any other proscons between choosing more smaller instances vs fewer larger for a Cassandra database maybe even nodes in general Are there any best practices associated to choosing Cassandra server sizesp  pPS I added the Java tag because Cassandra is built using JAVA and runs on the JVM and would like to see if the JVM has any proscons.p

When dealing with high cardinality dimensions, elements are retrieved in blocks first N elements are retrieved, when these elements are read, next ones from N1 to 2N are got. N number is this property. Setting great values for this property increases performance but may overload memory.

Positive 2149 pI understand the difference between a daemon thread and a regular thread.  By calling codesetDaemontruecode, the thread will be marked such that it will not keep the JVM alive.  The JVM will automatically shut down when there are no more nondaemon threads running.  When you start up the JVM, only the main thread is a nondaemon thread.p  pI also understand that the priority of a thread can be set independently of this.  By calling codesetPriorityThread.MAXPRIORITYcode, the thread will be set to have the maximum scheduling priority allowed by its thread group.  I feel like I have a good grasp on these concepts.p  pMy question is  is there anything inherent in the daemon thread that would reduce its priority  or is it merely a flag saying you dont have to wait for me to shut down the JVMp  pIm working with a thread in a shared library that cannot be shutdown through the API.  I have asked for this thread to be flagged as a daemon thread, but the owner is concerned that this will reduce its priority in the scheduler.  It seems to me that since the priority is managed separately from the daemon thread designation, that they should be orthogonal.  Im having a hard time finding documentation of this, however.p

That way, I wouldnt have to explicitly configure the dispatcher by adding controllermodule directories. Id be able to drop in a module and have it accessible immediately.pli lipWhy is there a distinction between view and action helpers Currently, the helpers arent designed to be shared throughout the code and there are inconsistent methods of loading and accessing the helpers. Other frameworks allow you to share the same helpers anywhere in your code. I dont see the need to specialize and violate DRY.pli ol  pZend View Questionsp  ol lipWhy do views use this to access resources I dont see the need for the extra typing. Some other frameworks extract an array of view variables and allow loading global functions or autoloading static helpers from within the view myHelpersomeMethodpli lipWhy do view helpers only allow one function per class That results in a lot of classes and associated maintenance.

Negative 2149 pAIR seems to keep its own DNS cache when an application is running, and ignores any changes to the OS DNS cache i.e. ipconfig flushdns. p  pMore specifically, Im creating multiple URLStream amp URLRequest objects over a long period of time in a AIR application.  Once the first one connects the hosts IP address is cached for the lifetime of the application.  And the URLRequest.useCache property, understandably, has no effect on DNS caching.p  pDoes anyone know if its possible or how to force a host name to reresolve inside a AIR or Flash applicationp  pNote Unfortunately, resolving the IP through a web service and rewriting the URL is not an option as a workaround.  The usecase is downloading files from Amazon S3 using signed URLs which are invalidated if modified.p  pUpdate  The test results above were gathered on WinXP prior to AIR 1.5.2. Subsequent tests using 1.5.2 show serialized requests with URLStream.load are reresolved more frequently but still ignore TTL values.  I still havent figured out what conditions are necessary to trigger the reresolution, but have noted a couple of cases that prevent it.  For instance, if another asynchronous URLStream is active to the same host then requests use the cached IP address and are not resolved. And simply closing and dereferencing all streams to a host is not sufficient to ensure the same host name will be reresolved in the next request.p

Negative 2149 pWhat is the best way to upgrade  patch a .Net MVC application.  Ideally from a single file as most installations of the application will be very basic computer users.  So asking them to stop IIS, copy files, run sql scripts etc is not possible.p  pTwo possible approaches would bep  ul lipExecutable which locates the site on the machine and copies over new files and runs sql updates for the db.  Problem is what is the best way to locate the site  How easy is it to query and stop a site in IIS 5.1 onwards.pli lipUpload a zip file to a page on the site.  From there the site can extract the zip file and copy over files and run a sql script.  Copying over views  content etc and running a sql script is not a problem.

Negative 2149 pIn VS, it is possible to set a custom build rule at the individual file level. However, unless you change the description of the build step which is what msbuild outputs when running the external tool, all you get is the default, which says Performing Custom Build Step, followed by the error output of the tool.p  pI recently got burned by this in an inherited solution, where the build rule for a .asm file buried deep in a project was failing, and NASM didnt provide any useful debug information. Since I didnt know what file was failing, it took me forever to find the problem. One thing I tried was changing the description for all the projects in the solution by selecting them all at once and opening the properties panel and adding macros to show the project and file affected. Since the build rule was attached to a emfileem, however, this naturally didnt work.p  pI also tried searching for the default description string in all the project files, but the project files dont store this information emunlessem you set the value. So clearly, theres got to be a default somewhere. Anyone know how you can set this p

Negative 2149 pLets say I have a scenario where I have a Service that is responsible for retrieving the price of a single product given the ID and another Service that gives me the current stock position of it.p  pIts okay when Im looking only at one product, but what about a list page where I have 60 products What should I do in this case Call the service product by product to retrieve its current price and stock position p  pI think this would be extremely slow and cost a lot of resources. But what could I do to make it look good and at the same time have performancep  pCurrently we have these information in the database in a column next to the product. These price and stock columns are updated by a sql service that updates it when is necessary so when I need to grab the value for a lot of products at the same time I just need to select two columns more. Its really fast, but right now we have some more systems in need of this information and I would like to transform all these stuff in a service.p  pThanks a lot p

Negative 2149 pI have a speed critical multithreaded program which involves data in a tree structure.

So when I need to process interestinginfoABC of node n then I enter the critical section of that node nodecritsec[n], do my processing and then leave. The program meanders around the tree taking all sorts of complex paths following links to parents and children. The program will also grow the tree, i.e. add new nodes and modify the parentchildren links of other nodes accordingly the tree never shrinks. I try and ensure that each thread only ever locks one node at a time to avoid the risk of deadlocks. But then I have a problem if Im adding a new node then I may want to lock the nodes parent so that I can adjust its list of children. Getting this to all to work without either deadlocks or two threads attempting to modify data in the same node is getting to be a bit of a nightmare. Is there some guiding principle I should be following about when and which nodes to lockunlock that I should be following  or do I just have to be supersmart and work out every permutation of events that can occurp

Negative 2149 pThe application I am working on uses thread pool. Heres the basic pseudo code.p  pOn the main threadp  precodeforeachObject obj in Component.GetObject              Invoke the thread pool providing the call back method to be called on the background thread and pass the object as the parameter.  Wait for the threads to complete. codepre  pThe Component.GetObject will basically return a CLR object using Yield return. This object needs to be processed by two other components on threads. So we are invoking the thread pool providing the call back method that will invoke the two components.p  pIf there is an exception on the spawned threads, the parent thread needs to be notified so that it can break out of the for loop i.e. stop spawing more threads, wait for the spawned threads to complete and then handle the exception.p  pBased on my reading, one of the approaches would be have a flag variable on the main thread. If there is an exception on the spawned thread, the thread would set the variable using locking mechanism. The parent thread would check the flag variable before spawning new threads.p  pI would like to know if there is a better approach for handling this scenario. Thread pool is being used since it manages the queueing of threads if the for loop spawns more threads than the thread pool limit.p

Negative 2149 pim having a problem.  When i create a WPF project and want to see the link to open in  expression blend  it is not there like a Silverlight project does. I can use the open with link to gain access to blend and then open blend and work from there. That is the  work around.  However, from internet searching i found out that expression blend has to be installed before visual studio not viceaversa in order to see open in expression  blend with a wpf project.  This happens in Window 7 x64 OS and x32 OS. I also found when working with regedit that x64 and x32 are setup differently with respect to expression blend. p  pSomebody please help in correcting this problem.p

Negative 2149 pLets start by getting on the same page about MVC on the web. The control receives requests, selects a view, sends a response that it gets from the view.

Perhaps it is different for different kinds of errors.p  psome examplesp  blockquote   ul   liThe request path is meaningless, so we want to respond with a custom not found page.   ul   liThe control selects the not found view and uses its responseli   liThe control builds the not found page itselfli   ulli   ul blockquote  p.p  blockquote   ul   liThe controller selects a view successfully, but the view throws an exception.   ul   liThe view returns an error status.

Ive face with one strange issue when I display a dialog which is intended to be a full screen its shown centered and have 13 width of screen aligned to the top.

I tried a lot of tricks changed window flags and type, specify FILLPARENT layout params, etc.  Dialog always keeps same width. p  pAnother thing I observe is shutdown animation, which plays within exactly the same screen area instead of being full screen like. Similiar to dialog which has to be full screen.p  pAnd finally I see that when device goes from standby to on state, sometimes lock screen is displayed within the same screen area 13rd width of screen, centered but not full screen. p  pSo my guess that theres an issue somewhere inside the Window Manager or Window Service which sometimes calculate wrong window dimensions.p  pAre you familiar with this problem or have any clue where to dig intop  pThanksp

Negative 2149 pThe control needs to be able to paint text on several lines, respond to clicks on URLs or user tags, etc, which need to have a different color in order to stand out.p  pThe first obvious choice was a richedit control, but I ran into many issues with this. First off, I would like the text to be nonselectable and input to be disabled. The latter is easy, but the only way I found to disallow selecting text is to disable the control. In that case I cant figure out how to change the background color from the default gray to white. In addition, all the clickable link functionality I get for free from richedit stops working when the control is disabled.p  pWhat would you say are my options Im very wary of trying to use TextOut to make my own control. That might make me want to cry.p  pEDIT Until now I didnt consider allowing the user to select text as an option, so the read only mode didnt seem useful. I just had it planned in my head that way. I definitely want there to not be a blinking caret, so I poked around and found that I can call HideCaret on WMSETFOCUS of the richedit by subclassing it and returning 0. That got rid of the caret for good. Ironically, that also got rid of the ability to select anything with the mouse, which is almost exactly the behavior I was hoping for in the first place. I dont know if Im entirely opposed to disallowing selection though. Ill get back to that. Now all thats left is to figure out if I can override the behavior of the cursors image changing when hovering over text.p

Negative 2149 pIm working on a project where Im developing a pseudo Unified Communications middle tier solution Presence amp Call Control utilizing Genesys as a backend which is a CTI solution providerwww.genesyslab.com. The front end of the solution could be a web based application Prefer not to use ActiveX although my company is a Microsoft shopp  pGenesys uses socket based communication and communication is asynchronous. For example I send a request to place a phone call to Genesys and Genesys responds with an event indicating that the phone call is being dialed, and established.p  pBased on my limited experience with ntier design, what Im envisioning so far is a windows service to handle the socket communication to Genesys and maintain state of all call activity in the environment. Next I see a WCF service communicating to the windows service to provide details about call state to web based clients using basic or ws binding. This would allow me to get out of using ActiveX, but would require polling so most likely I would have multiple WCF instances with load balancing to share the load. p  pAm I on the right track Can WCF communicate to a windows service as well as provide service to clients Any other architectural approach suggestions would be greatly appreciated p  pBest regards, Jasonp

Negative 2149 pI am trying to come up with a method for generating X amount of random points in a given area in my case a square. The one thing that makes this such an issue is that each point has to be at least Y units away from all other points.p  pWhat springs to mind at first is in c to check the distance between the new point and all existing pointsp  precodewhilepoints.Count lt pointsToGenerate       Point newPoint  NewPoint      bool addPoint  true      foreachPoint p in points                 ifp  newPoint.Length lt minDistance                          addPoint  false               break                        ifaddPoint                 points.AddnewPoint        codepre  pNow this would certainly work however if no valid points were ever found this would become a never ending loop. So throw in a magical number Z there as a limit of triesp  precodeifloopCount gt 100       break  codepre  pNow this has some obvious problems. If the points are randomly generated, then loopCount can go above Z even if there are places left to place the point. It not only can, but it will happenp  pWhat I could do is to create a list of available point per each pass and then select a random one of those. This would work flawlessly except for one thing Performance. Im not in need of super performance in my application, but the area is 10002. A lot of points to check per pass even if I limit myself to integersp  pSo, what I can come up with might not suffice, thus I would love some assistance on this. Is there a better way to generate X points in an area A with the minimum distance between points Yp  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrong With better, I mean generally better where a balance of performance vs perfection is achieved. A bit vague, I know. Im not entierly sure how much overhead I can have for generating those points yet so Im basically after anything more elegant than my own method.p  pRobertp

Negative 2149 pI am completing an Android program to classify the genre of a song on a mobile phone.  The classification code is implemented in a native shared library not written by me.  Unfortunately, it only classifies correctly the first time, any times after then it just returns the previous result.

Negative 2149 pFor my Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures class, my professor asked us to pick any topic that interested us. He also told us to research it and to try and implement a solution in it. I chose Neural Networks because its something that Ive wanted to learn for a long time. p  pIve been able to implement an AND, OR, and XOR using a neural network whose neurons use a step function for the activator. After that I tried to implement a backpropagating neural network that learns to recognize the XOR operator using a sigmoid function as the activator. I was able to get this to work 90 of the time by using a 331 network 1 bias at the input and hidden layer, with weights initialized randomly. At other times it seems to get stuck in what I think is a local minima, but I am not sure Ive asked questions on this before and people have told me that there shouldnt be a local minima.p  pThe 90 of the time it was working, I was consistently presenting my inputs in this order code[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 0]code with the expected output set to code[0, 1, 1, 0]code. When I present the values in the same order consistently, the network eventually learns the pattern. It actually doesnt matter in what order I send it in, as long as it is the exact same order for each epoch.p  pI then implemented a randomization of the training set, and so this time the order of inputs is sufficiently randomized. Ive noticed now that my neural network gets stuck and the errors are decreasing, but at a very small rate which is getting smaller at each epoch. After a while, the errors start oscillating around a value so the error stops decreasing.p  pIm a novice at this topic and everything I know so far is selftaught reading tutorials, papers, etc.. Why does the order of presentation of inputs change the behavior of my network Is it because the change in error is consistent from one input to the next because the ordering is consistent, which makes it easy for the network to learn p  pWhat can I do to fix this Im going over my backpropagation algorithm to make sure Ive implemented it right currently it is implemented with a learning rate and a momentum. Im considering looking at other enhancements like an adaptive learningrate. However, the XOR network is often portrayed as a very simple network and so Im thinking that I shouldnt need to use a sophisticated backpropagation algorithm. p

The codeScrollViewercode seems to be automatically adjusting the horizontal offset of the codeScrollViewercode when either of the codeSlidercodes gains focus  from a mouse click for example .p  pstrongReproducing the behaviourstrongp  ol liRun the application, you will see that the horizontal scroll bar of the ScrollViewer is visible.li liClick on the Green  far left  codeSlidercode, you will notice that the ScrollViewer automatically adjusts to shift the horizontal offset to where the perceived content starts.li ol  pThese symptoms occur at either end of the scroll pane.p  pScreenshot of application when it is run  Application is Zoomed in 200 for detail clarity p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comF33G0.jpg altScreenshot1p  pScreenshot of the behavior when the left slider is clickedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comW844A.jpg altenter image description herep  pstrongWhat I want to happenstrongp  pWhen I click on either slider item  at either end  when a slider looks to be beyond end of the slider  slider range is denoted by the black bar at the top  I emdontem want the ScrollViewer to automatically adjust its horizontal offset.p  pstrongSuspected problemstrongp  pI suspect that the problem is that the ScrollViewer perceives the actual content of its childen starts 15 pixels  the drawn width of both of my sliders  in from where the actual drawn content does start. The Canvas only draws because I included a padding of 15 pixels inside of the codeSliderTestcode control on the main window, if this padding is removed the ScrollViewer does not show any of the Sliders Canvas.p  pstrongEDITstrong  it appears the padding is not the problem, read the comments as to why.p  pstrongThings I have triedstrongp  pI have tried looking into overriding the OnPreviewMouseDown event of the main Window. The problem here is that I still want both Sliders to behave normally, setting the event to Handled causes the Slider to stop working completely.p  pstrongNotesstrongp  pThe Sliders within the range selector control  Called SliderTest in this example  must both have a width of 1 pixel. The sliders must be able to extend 15 pixels past the end of the time selection range  see the black bar at the top for a reference .p  pThank you for reading this novellengthed problem.p

Negative 2149 pI am getting LNK2001 errors when trying to use Crypto. The official advice for this isp  blockquote   pThere are two ways you can deal with this, either change Crypto to export those classes, by using the CRYPTOPPDLL macro, or link with both the DLL export library and a static library that contains the nonDLL classes and functions.

Also through logging we could identify that user are hitting the same server, but the session have became null.li liThis doesnt seem to be a client issue as well, because they are able to go through the application successfully even if they have encountered an error before.li liThis doesnt seem to be a traffic load or server load issue, because it happen through out the day at random times, and happens to random users during.li liThis doesnt seem to be caused by recycling the app pool.li liThis doesnt seem to be caused by session timeout as we have set the timeout to be two hour and while we track the log, users could experience this 510min into the flow.li ol  pSide note We must use InProc session state due to our Sitecore CMS.  So changing the design is not an option.p  pI have a theory it might have something to do with session locking or being corrupted from concurrent access attempts.p  pA few place we see the occurrence of this problem a lot from our application is when the users is being redirected by a javascript windows.location.p  pAnd in areas where async ajax calls are being made.p  pWe been scratching our heads on this for a while, Im wondering if anyone out there would have any insight or theory to what might the problem bep  pThanks p  pAdded Notep  pMystere ampamp H27Studio, So Ive also discovered something relating to sessionID or session reset issues.  In some case we discover that on a page redirect it is triggering two duplicate GETS calls to the method, with the first call missing a sessionID and randomly get redirected to one of the server This is because the server persistent session from the load balancer is base on client IP, sessionID and other header information to create unique session to keep a client on one server.  This happen every time during the flow when our redirect page is using a window.location.  p  pThis will cause the Object reference not set.. issue for the client if the bad, no sessionID call hit the same server. This probably because the first bad call with no sessionID is causing the application to create a new session which overrides the original sessions object  So even on the second call where the correct sessionID is pass into the application we will discover that session object contain null.p  pSo I believe there is an issue with the duplicate call thats clearing out the session object, which not sure why or what is causing that to begin with.p  pAnyone have clue regarding this  Thanksp  pstrongUpdatestrong We are planning to take these steps in hope to resolve this issue.p  ol liWe have issues in areas where Async Ajax calls were made, so we are planning to remove the Async feature and let it the Ajax run in sync.li liWe have issues where a Windows.location javascript redirect is happening.  We have created an alternative method using postback in hope of fixing the issue in this area.li liOther areas, which arent related to one of the above issue are still up in the air.li ol  pEffect of change will be posted once we deploy it to production.p  pThanks for all the comments.p

Negative 2149 pI am working on probabilistic models, and when doing inference on those models, the estimated probabilities can become very small. In order to avoid underflow, I am currently working in the log domain I store the log of the probabilities. Multiplying probabilities is equivalent to an addition, and summing is done by using the formulap  precodelogexpa  expb  logexpa  m  expb  m  m codepre  pwhere codem  maxa, bcode.p  pI use some very large matrices, and I have to take the elementwise exponential of those matrices to compute matrixvector multiplications. This step is quite expensive, and I was wondering if there exist other methods to deal with underflow, when working with probabilities.p  pstrongEditstrong for efficiency reasons, I am looking for a solution using primitive types and not objects storing arbitraryprecision representation of real numbers.p  pstrongEdit 2strong I am looking for a faster solution than the log domain trick, not a more accurate solution. I am happy with the accuracy I currently get, but I need a faster method. Particularly, summations happen during matrixvector multiplications, and I would like to be able to use efficient BLAS methods.p  pstrongSolutionstrong after a discussion with Jonathan Dursi, I decided to factorize each matrix and vector by its largest element, and to store that factor in the log domain. Multiplications are straightforward. Before additions, I have to factorize one of the added matricesvectors by the ratio of the two factors. I update the factor every ten operations.p

Negative 2149 pI have recently begun working on an MVC3 application with a SQL Server 2008R2 backend.  The application receives streaming data from a web query and then inserts the data into a table as and when new data is received.  The application can sometimes receive data that has already been inserted the data being received includes a pregenerated primary key  this key has been generated before my application receives it in the event of this i do not want to insert this into the table as it is already present.  I realise I could generate my own primary key, however I do not want any duplicate rows in the database.p  pThe easiest solution I could think of was an INSTEAD OF trigger on the table that fires on each insert and then ignores the insert if the row already exists my thinking was then that the MVC app did not then need to check to see whether the record already existed before it attempted the insert.  p  pThis was working fine, however when I ported it to SQL Azure, I now receive a primary key violation error every time the MVC attempts to insert a row that already exists  as if the trigger is not functioning.  If I connect to the SQL Azure instance in SSMS and try and do the insert using a key that already exists in the table I receive no error, so I know that the trigger is present and functioning.p  pIn the MVC code I am using LINQ to SQL classes I generated from the database and the InsertOnSubmit method on those classes.p  pDoes anyone know why this might be happening Or alternatively suggest a better solution for what I am trying to achieve I am sure there is a probably a better way to do it in LINQ or something.  I am pretty new to Azure, LINQ and MVC so any suggestions welcomep  pThanks in advance.p  pstrongEditstrong Trigger code is now below  as I said this is working fine when I run it on my local SQL DB  and if I try and do an insert using an already existing primary key on the Azure DB in management studio it works OK.

Negative 2149 pIm trying to create a filter to show certain records that are considered trending. So the idea is to select records that are voted heavily upon but not list them in descending order from most voted to least voted. This is so a user can browse and have a chance to see all links, not just the ones that are at the top. What do you recommend would be the best way to do this Im lost as to how I would create a random assortment of trending links, but not have them repeat as a user goes from page to page.

I need to run a daily report based on the time zone of my server, AmericaNew York.  Due to number of tables involved, I used ARel select method to join multiple tables and passed in begindate  and enddate timestamps. I have difficulty to get correct result set returned. It should return records with UTC timestampsp  precode20120428 040000    to   20120429 040000     codepre  pbut it returned records with UTC timestamps p  precode20120428 000000    to   20120429 000000     codepre  pWhat I can figured out is to change the class method p  precodedef self.transactions2businessid, begindate, enddate   sttzoffset         Time.zone.now.formattedoffsettrue stbegindatetz     begindate 000000sttzoffset stenddatetz       enddate 000000sttzoffset  trans  LogVouchers.select        createdat    . where       createdat gt  TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE  at time zone utc     and createdat lt TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE  at time zone utc   ,      stbegindatetz  ,     stenddatetz    end codepre  pWhich in fact, tells Postgres to translate that codetimestamp with time zonecode into codetimestamp without time zonecode before comparing. And that worked for me. I know this is too complicated. I would very much appreciate someone pointing out a better way to achieve this. p  h3Additional Note 2h3  ul liIf possible, I would avoid changing default setting in UbuntuLinux server, Postgres server as it tends to cause other side effects. li liIn the future,  these daily cutoff timestamps are based on the codeTimeZonecode setting of codecurrentusercode instead of the codeTimeZonecode of server. Because users of same web app can be spanned over multiple time zones and the daily report has to make sense to respective logged in user. li ul

Negative 2149 pI would like to match up PDB files from the Protein Databank to canonical AA sequences for the protein as displayed in Cosmic or Uniprot. Specifically, what I need to do is pull from the pdb file, the carbon alpha atoms in the backbone and their xyz positions. I also need to pull their actual order in the proteins sequence. For structure 3GFT Kras  Uniprot Accession Number P01116, this is easy, I can just take the ResSeq number. However, for some other proteins, I cant figure out how this is possible.p  pFor example, for structure 2ZHQ protein F2  Uniprot Accession Number P00734, the Seqres has the ResSeq numbers repeated for numbers 1 and 14 and only differs in the Icode entry. Further the icode entries are not in lexographic order so its hard to tell what order to extract. p  pIt gets even worse if you consider structure 3V5Q Uniprot Accession Number Q16288. For most of the protein, the ResSeq number matches the actual amino acid from a source like COSMIC or UNIPROT. Howver after Position 711, it jumps to position 730. When looking at REMARK 465 the missing atoms, it shows that for chain A , 726729 are missing. However after matching it up to the protein, those AA actually are 712715. p  pIve attached code that works fro the simple 3GFT example but if someone is an expert in pdb files and can help me get the rest of it figured out, I would be much obliged.p  precodelibrarygdata  answerlt get.positionshttpwww.pdb.orgpdbfiles2ZHQ.pdb,L answerlt get.positionshttpwww.pdb.orgpdbfiles3GFT.pdb,A   This function reads a pdb file and returns the appropriate data structure get.positions lt functionsourcefile, chainrequired  A N lt 105 AACount lt 0 positions  data.frameResiduerepNA, N,AtomCountrep0, N,SideChainrepNA, N,XCoordrep0, N,YCoordrep0, N,ZCoordrep0, N,stringsAsFactorsFALSE       visited  list filedata lt readLinessourcefile, n 1 fori in 1 lengthfiledata input  filedata[i] id  substrinput,1,4 ifid  ATOM   type  substrinput,14,15   iftype  CA     resSerial  strtoisubstrinput, 7,11     residue  substrinput,18,20     typeofchain  substrinput,22,22     resSeq  strtoisubstrinput, 23,26     altLoc  substrinput,17,17      ifresSeq gt1 does not include negative residues       iftypeofchain  chainrequired ampamp resSerial in visited  ampamp altLoc     altLoc  A          visited lt cvisited, resSerial         AACount lt AACount  1         positionstring list         positionstring[[1]] as.numericsubstrinput,31,38         positionstring[[2]] as.numericsubstrinput,39,46         positionstring[[3]] as.numericsubstrinput,47,54         printinput         positions[AACount,]lt cresidue, resSeq, typeofchain, positionstring[[1]], positionstring[[2]], positionstring[[3]]                        positionsltpositions[1AACount,]   positions[,2]lt as.numericpositions[,2]   positions[,4]lt as.numericpositions[,4]   positions[,5]lt as.numericpositions[,5]   positions[,6]lt as.numericpositions[,6]   return positions  codepre

Negative 2149 pThere I am making a 2D game in C XNA 4.0, and run across yet again a petty annoyance of mine the strongRectanglestrong. For those using basic collision, this is almost a necessity. For almost any game object created you need to have a rectangle. Then I go to change the X, check collision, or anything else. And there I begin the neverending battle of codeobjectName.Rectangle.Whatevercode. To get around this I of course give the class of objectName propertiesmethods that access these for me.p  pThen I dared to dream. I had grand designs to make a basic game object class that everything drawable would inherit from, that would allow parenting, precise local coordinates floats, and hold the texturespritebatch. To make this complete I was ready to inherit from Rectangle, to use all the methods and attributes that it holds. Heck, whenever something required a Rectangle, I could be so lazy as to say objectName, not objectName.Rectangle.p  pThen I realized, not a chance. I started out depressed as my ohsoclever idea was smashed to bits. Since then my perfect little class holds a rectangle, with various methods and properties accessing it as needed. I have also taken the chance to have it inherit from the XNA DrawableGameComponent. While in the long run this has been more practical, every time I view a draw or update method and see the call to rectangle I often wonder, was there ever a hope to do what I had wanted Was there some clever work around that I could have done Or was inheriting from a Rectangle truly sealed from my graspp  pWhile using the DrawableGameComponent class provided in XNA allows most gameobject related actions happen inside the classes Update method, every time outside of a class I need to reference not to property of a Rectangle, but rather the Rectangle itself, I am slightly peeved considering that in really every way my object is, in fact, and soupedup Rectangle. And then once again I can find myself askingp  pstrongIs there any way to inherit from a predefined struct, or give the project the impression you are a workaroundstrongp

Negative 2149 pIve been developing a mobile site for my homepage and I have run into an issue when hooking into mobile touchevents.

So touchend works like expected in iOS, when the user lifts her finger the function makes a call to jQuery.scrollTop which gives me a pixel value for how much the user has scrolled down. However on Android Browser devices it seems that the jQuery.scrollTop value is calculated on touchstart. That is to say the event doesnt fire off properly, I get the correct pageX amp Y coordinates from the touchend event, however scrolltop returns the value from when the user started scrolling. Ive checked around on the inet and this seems to be a known android browser bug, what I want to know is if there a decent workaround for this issue i.e. one that doesnt involve preventing the default scroll behaviour Thanks in advancep

When loading the page with a qwhatever, the content within that DIV is replaced with other content.p  pstrongMY SOLUTIONstrongp  pIn order to have a DIV dissapea, which was the first issue to resolve, based on a querystring coming through, I implemented this on my pagep  precodeif strrposSERVER[REQUESTURI], landingpageindex.phpq1  strlenSERVER[REQUESTURI]  strlenlandingpageindex.phpq1      style  display none  else      style  display inline  codepre  pstrongI then place this in my DIVstrongp  precodeltdiv idtheForm styleltphp echo style gtgt     Form code here ltdivgt codepre  pThis got me to at least have the DIV clear out if the query string was present. p  pNext step, was to not really clear it out, but replace it with some content.p  pstrongI added the following into my original PHPstrongp  precodethankYou  lth1gtThank You for signing uplth1gt codepre  pUnder the first if, and changed the else to an elseif to capture the non query string code, with potentially some more cases down the road.p  pstrongSo the final PHP code looks like thisstrongp  precodeif strrposSERVER[REQUESTURI], landingpageindex.phpq1  strlenSERVER[REQUESTURI]  strlenlandingpageindex.phpq1      style  display none     thankYou  lth1gtThank You for signing uplth1gt  elseif strrposSERVER[REQUESTURI], landingpageindex.php  strlenSERVER[REQUESTURI]  strlenlandingpageindex.php      style  display inline     thankYou    codepre  pThen its just a matter of adding in the PHP echo out of the thankYou variable right before the DIV that will be shown or hidden, and that did it for me.p

Negative 2149 pI have a page that queries events on a selected calendar date and groups them in an individual table for each different event type.p  pObviously this list could get quite large and rather than having everything displayed and the user having to scroll a lot I was hoping I could use the toggle function to hide a list of events for an event type when they click the table header for that event type.p  pThe issue Im struggling to get my head around is that I have no idea how many different event types there will be for any selected date so how do I write a function that will hide only that selected event typep

Negative 2149 pIm making a program to solve second grade equations e.g. 2x2x2 and I was trying to have the user input the whole equation in a single text box.

Negative 2149 pIm making my first app. I use Xcode 4 with storyboard to get a better picture of whats going on. The app starts in the storybard with a TabBarController with 4 tabs. Two of the tabs are navigation controllers with tableview systems, and the other two tabs are regular viewcontrollers.p  pIve made the TabBarController itself in the Storyboard only, not made a class for it or anything. So all the tabs are running at the same time in the app it seems, they remain unchanged when I enter another tab and back. It looks kind of unprofessional, and maybe bad for iphone toop  pNow I want to make the left tab become unactivereset to the RootViewController when another tab is entered. p  pIn other words make some kind of delegate function for the TabBar so only the selected tab is active. Something like that. Correct me if Im wrong, Im just trying to make an understanding of what I need to do.p  pAfter what I understand after my research, all I have to make a property for the TabBar in the AppDelegate.h, synthesize it in AppDelegate.m then somehow make the TabBars delegate to AppDelegate self  or something, thats done in here somehow AppDelegate.mp  precode BOOLapplicationUIApplication application didFinishLaunchingWithOptionsNSDictionary launchOptions some statements. codepre  pthen add something like this somewhere in the AppDelegate.mp  precode voidtabBarUITabBar tabBar didSelectItemUITabBarItem item With some statements about the viewcontrollers codepre  pBut as you see Im not very experienced with coding, and I cant find a tutorialguide I understand because they use xibs etc..

Negative 2149 pIm using the Razor template engine in a C console app and trying to expand an object tree to a text file.  Im having some difficulty figuring out how to get hierarchical expansion to work.p  pIt is probable that I have completely misunderstood how hierarchical template expansion is supposed to work in Razor.  I need to know if my current approach is almost right and just needs fixing, or if I am doing it completely the wrong way, then what is the right way of doing thisp  pBonus question Is Razor the right tool for this or is there a better alternativep  pI have created a small test app to demonstrate the problem.  The class codeTemplateTreeModelcode defines the model that is passed into Razor.  This class defines a tree, the codeChildrencode member is a list of child codeTemplateTreeModelcode instances.p  pI want to instance the model and pass it into Razor like thisp  precodevar model  new TemplateTreeModel ... add children to the tree ... var expanded  Razor.ParseTemplate, model codepre  pcodeTemplateTreeModelcode has a member function codeExpandChildrencode that does the hierarchical expansion.  I use it within the template like thisp  precodeModel.ExpandChildren codepre  pMy test app generates very odd results.  Some of the leaf nodes are repeated in the output and only level 3 nodes are present.  The root node level 1 and the level 2 nodes are missing from the output.p  pUpdate For some more context on this, the real use case for this is that I want to generate code from an abstract syntax tree.  So I have a bunch of templates that represent the script to output for each AST node.  I then want to expand recursively from the root AST node to translate the AST into a script file.p  pFollowing is the full code for the test app.  To get this working you need to put the code in a C console app and reference RazorEngine available here a hrefhttprazorengine.codeplex.com relnofollowhttprazorengine.codeplex.coma.p  precodeusing System using System.Collections.Generic using System.Text using RazorEngine using RazorEngine.Templating  namespace RazorTest      public class Program              public class TemplateTreeModel                      private static int nextID  1              public TemplateTreeModelstring template, int level                              this.Level  level                 this.ID  nextID                 this.Template  template                 this.Children  new ListltTemplateTreeModelgt                           public int Level  get private set              public int ID  get private set              public string Template  get private set              public ListltTemplateTreeModelgt Children  get private set               public string ExpandChildren                              var output  new StringBuilder                  foreach var child in this.Children                                      output.Appendchild.Expand                                   return output.ToString                           public string Expand                              var expanded  Razor.Parsethis.Template, this                 return expanded                           public TemplateTreeModel DefineChildTemplateTreeModel child                              this.Children.Addchild                 return this                                public static void Mainstring[] args                      try                              var template  Node Model.ID Level Model.LevelnModel.ExpandChildrenn                 var root                      new TemplateTreeModeltemplate, 1.

Negative 2149 pA common practice in C to implement Object Oriented is using an array of function pointers. This seems to be similar to the C vtable and in essence the C virtual functions mechanism is just syntactic sugar around an array of function pointers.br But the C mechanism has an additional feature which is missing in C. A function pointer can be NULL and the caller can check if the function is NULL to see if an object implements a certain method. In C however a method cannot be NULL and a class cannot not implement a method.p  pWhat is the closest way of mimicking this behavior in Cp

Negative 2149 pIve been trying to create a web application where Im trying to create appointments with clients. The way I picture it, when the user of the app wants to create an appointment with a client, they will first select a link like Create Appointment, and then they will be presented with a screen where they either select an existing client, or enter the information for the new one.p  pThe primary issue Ive been struggling with is the general flow of the application when a POST should occur, and how much should stay in memory. Obviously, if the user needs to create a client, I could forward the browser to another screen, save the user, and send them back, but I really think that saving a client midflow the flow being creating an appointment is bad I want to save everything at the end.p  pIve spent a lot of time investigating frameworks like AngularJS to see if they solve this problem, and I dont think they do. Im pretty sure I want to do all of this in the DOM with Javascript because its all in memory and then send one POST with everything in it.p  pAssuming that keeping everything in memory and sending one large POST for the entire workflow, how would you suggest the JSON look What would be a reasonable way to decipher between an existing client and new client in the JSON Are there any frameworks that exist that would make it easier to solve this particular problem.p  pMan, all I wanted to do was make a screen to choose a client or create a new one without having to direct the user away from the flow.

I am not doing this with the two elements method, in which one would be positioned behind the other and act as the border, because the elements background is transparent, and positioning an element behind it would affect its transparency.p  pI know this can be done via JavaScript, but i am looking for an css only method, if possible at all.p

Negative 2149 pSo I want to queue some actions to be invoked.p  pA little background trying to send requests using Webclient but apparantly it doesnt allow very long URLS upward of 2000 characters and found the upper bound for that value in my system is around 40 items 43 to be exact.

Negative 2149 pI have a v4.0 assembly that is both in the GAC 4.0 location for runtime use and in a location on disk for designtime use.

Negative 2149 pI realize this has been somewhat touched upon in various places including a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5596354insertionofthousandsofcontactentriesusingapplybatchisslowherea on Stack Overflow, but Im looking for any other solutions that people might have used.  So with that in mind...p  pIm developing an application where a user can initially sync all his contacts with a desktop application OTA.  This is done through a web service call that grabs a set of 100 contacts from the server, downloads and parses the information, inserts the contacts into the Android Contact DB, acknowledges receipt of these contacts, and then repeats the previous steps with the next set of 100 contacts until the sync is complete.  This process works well when a user has contacts on the order or 10002000, but a typical user of this application can easily have 50006000 contacts with power users having upwards of 10000 in which case things take far longer than Id like.  For example, a sample set of approximately 5300 contacts can take about 13.5 minutes to complete.  Not bad, but Id like it to be at least as efficient as iOS which runs about 8 minutes for the same data set if possible.p  pIve logged the time it takes for each step and, unsurprisingly, the bottleneck appears to be with inserting the data into the Android contract DB.  After scouring the web Ive found little help with regards to inserting thousands of contacts, but what I have found seems to fall into these three groupsp  p1 ContentProviderOperation  The Google recommended way which gave me my baseline of 13.5 minutes for 5300 contacts.p  p2 Bulk Inserts  I read that builkInsert tends to be more efficient than applyBatch, but when I tried to implement this myself it actually took 25 minutes for the same 5300 contacts.  I have a feeling a lot of this is due to the fact that I need to insert the RawContact information and then save the resulting URI for use in creating the ContactsContract.Data for the bulkInsert which comes more naturally via the backValueReference in the ContentProviderOperation.  Additionally, I looked at the android source code and I dont get the feeling that bulkInsert is terribly efficient. p  p3 Creating an optimized bulk insert using the DatabaseUtils.InsertHelper and transactions  Unfortunately, this seems geared towards those people who created their own content provider because you need access to the underlying DB as an instance variable and Ive yet to see how that could be done with the native contacts DB.p  pDoes anyone have any experience with inserting 5000 contacts or any other possible ideas I could look into to help reduce my time  Or should the ContentProviderOperation be considered as optimized as its going to getp

Negative 2149 pThe UICollectionViewFlowLayout is great, however, I want it tweaked slightly so that the scrollDirection is different from the layout direction.

AutoCAD opens the file, switch the active document and i cant enter in CLOSE state and then my machine state stops in PLOTTOPDF state.

Negative 2149 pI am sure this is a stupid question, but Im just not seeing it.p  pI have a page with many Kendo charts.  One of these appears where the bars go from left to right.  The others appear where the bars go from bottom to top.  What on earth is the property that controls this  I simply dont see it.  I wan them all to be vertical in nature.p  pThe single chart that is going from left to right is also the only chart that has its series predefined [x,y,z] rather than using dataSource.  It also is the only stacked chart I have.  Maybe something there causes thisp
Negative 2149 pBackground  Im making a portfolio site utilising both Swipe.js and Infinite Ajax Scroll JQ.p  pProblem When the content from extra pages is loaded into the current page, it is not processed by the alreadyloaded Swipe.js script.  This means that the new content doesnt have its markup changed needed for the swipe functionality to work.  p  pI think I need to get the Swipe.js script to fire after each page reload.  Would that fix it   Please explain this to me like Im an 8yr old.  JS is not a strong suit...p  pDemo a hrefhttphatchcreative.co.nztomo relnofollowhttphatchcreative.co.nztomoap  pYou can see that as the page loads new content, the buttons on either side of the sliders no longer work.p
Negative 2149 pUsing strongHead.jsstrong 0.9 and verifying the loading of scripts from IE9, the Network pane of IE9 developer shows that the javascripts are loaded twice.p  pFirst time, the script is loaded with HTTP result code 200, thereafter the same script is reloaded with result code 304 not modified. p  pHowever, the script pane and the script block drop down displays the scripts as being loaded twice. This in turn makes one of the scripts sIFR.js resetting its global sIFR object.p  pIm suspecting the doubleloading is causing this.p  pNote Chrome and Firefox both work as expected.p  pAnyone else having seen this odd behaviourp

Negative 2149 pFirst post, so Hi Let me start by saying Im a total noob regarding programming. I understand very basic stuff, but when it comes to checking exit codes or what the adequate term is, Im at a loss. Apparently my searchfoo is really weak in this area, I guess its a question of terminology.p  pemThanks in advance for taking your time to reading thisanswering my questionemp  pstrongDescriptionstrong I found a a hrefhttpcomicrack.cyolito.comforum13scripts30013cbr2cbzrartozipconversionforlinux relnofollow titlesourcescripta that convertsrepack .cbr files to .cbz files. These files are basically your average a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiRar relnofollowrara and a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiZIP28fileformat29 relnofollowzipa files, however renamed to another extension as they are used for comicbook applications such as a hrefhttpcomicrack.cyolito.com relnofollowcomicracka, a hrefhttpqcomicbook.orgoverview relnofollowqcomicbooka and what not. Surprisingly enough there no cbr  cbz converters out there. The advantages of .cbz is besides escaping the emproprietaryem rar file format, that one can store the metadata from a hrefhttpwww.comicvine.com relnofollowComic Vinea with e. g a hrefhttpscode.google.compcomictagger relnofollowcomictaggera.p  pstrongIssuestrong Sometimes the repackaging of the files doesnt end well and would hopefully be alleviated by a integrity check amp another go. I modified said script slightly to use a hrefhttpp7zip.sourceforge.net relnofollow titlebasically CLI 7zipp7zipa as it can both packunpack a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwiki7z relnofollow7za, zipfiles and a hrefhttpwww.7zip.org relnofollow titleXZ, BZIP2, GZIP, TAR and WIMsome othersa, i. e great for options. p7zip can test the archive byp  precode7z t comicfile.cbz tmpworkingdir codepre  pI guess its a matter of using if amp else here to check the integrity and then give it another go, if there are any error.p  h2Questiontldr What would be the bestadequate approach to add a integrity file check to the script belowh2  precodebinbash Source httpcomicrack.cyolito.comforum13scripts30013cbr3cbzrartozipconversionforlinux echo Converting CBRs to CBZs   Set the field separator to something other than spacesnewlines so that spaces  in the file names dont mess things up. Im using the pipe symbol  as it is very  unlikely to appear in a file name. IFS   Set working directory where to create the temp dir. The user you are using must have permission  to write into this directory.  For performance reasons Im using ram disk devshm in Ubuntu server. WORKDIRdevshm   Set name for the temp dir.

Negative 2149 pCan some body point me how to read the default windows gateway IP address in C. I am able to read the list of all the IP addresses using GetAdaptersInfo but not the default gateway IP address.p  precode   GetAdaptersInfo pAdapterInfo, ampBufferLength    Iterate the network adapters and print their MAC address.     while pAdapterInfo                          pAdapterInfo  pAdapterInfogtNext  Get next adapter info      codepre  pHere is the code snippet and wondering which field gives me the default gateway. I can get the gateway of every IP address in the list but I need the default gateway IP address.p  pThe original reason for wanting this was to select the specific MAC address from the bunch of MAC addresses of the IP which has got the default gateway.  As we get multiple MAC addresses while iterating thru the list, we thought the best way is pick up the MAC address of the IP which has the default gateway.  We have since changed our minds, and will choose the wired connection MAC address.  But I am still curious to know how to get the default gateway instead of iterating thru all the adapters.p

Negative 2149 pSo Im trying to authenticate against a third party web app. The documentation with this third party web app suggest taking the our security key provided by the third party web app and hashing it with salt. They then want us to pass the generated salt along with the hashed security key which becomes known as the secret in the URL. My understanding is the third party web app would then use the security key and hash it with the salt provided in the URL to see if it matches the secret passed along in the URL. This seems like a major security risk.

The app starts, titles and other labels are loaded immediately and images starts loading lazily and finally gets finished. So far so good. The user scrolls to reach the bottom, reaching the bottom will use the scroll delegate method and the counter gets incremented from 1 to 2 telling the fetchEntriesNew method to reach the second page of the rss feed. The program will start loading the next 10 entries at the bottom of first 10 previously fetched. This can go on and the program will fetch 10 more entries every time the user scrolls and reaches bottom and the new rows will be placed below the previously fetched ones. So far so good.p  pNow let us say the user is on page 3 currently which has been loaded completely with the images. Since page 3 is loaded completely that means currently there are 30 entries in the tableview. The user now scrolls to the bottom, the counter gets incremented and the tableview begins populating the new rows from page 4 of the rss feed at the bottom of the first 30 entries. Titles get populated quickly thus building the rows and while the images are getting downloaded not downloaded completely yet, the user quickly moves to the bottom again, instead of loading the 5th page at the bottom of the 4th, it will destroy the 4th ones that is currently in the middle of getting downloaded and starts loading the 4th one again. p  pWhat it should do is that it should keep on titles etc from next pages when user reaches the bottom of the tableview regardless of whether the images of the previous pages are in the middle of getting downloaded or not.p  pThere is NO issue with the downloading and persisting data in my project and all the data is persisted between the application runs. p  pCan someone help to point me out to the right direction. Thanks in advance.p  pstrongUPDATE 3strong Based on Sergios answer, this is what i didp  p1 Added another call to archiveRootObject [NSKeyedArchiver archiveRootObjectchannelCopy toFilecachePath] after         [channelCopy addItemsFromChannelobj]p  pAt this point, its not destroying and reloading the same batch again and again, exactly what i wanted.

This is what i did Added property Bool myBool in TheFeedStore, synthesised it and set it to NO after newly added archiveRootObjectchannelCopy and set it to YES in ListViewController at the very start of fetchEntries method.

Negative 2149 pIm creating a list with handles for sorting.

Negative 2149 pI have a site and I want it to randomly load a different HTML5 Javascript animation each time the page is loaded, JavaScript is by far one of the weakest of my skills and I appreciate any help in advance and if this happens to be duplicate Ive tried searching then please vote for the question to be closed.p  pBasically the method I have used is a dirty one and most likely the reason its not working, basically I tried randommath and had no luck and put this down to my JS skills being extremely weak, the alternative method which looked easier doesnt work either and this is basically inserting a HTML on page load, so for example a.html and b.html which both contain different scripts.p  pThis is what my code looks likep  pstrongHTMLstrongp  precodelthtmlgt ltheadgt     ltscript srcjsinsert.jsgtltscriptgtlt This inserts the Random Page gt ltheadgt ltbody onloadloadExternalHTMLPagegt      ltdiv idinjectjsgt ltdivgt     ltcanvasidgt ltcanvasgt ltscript srcjsanimationlibpageA.jsgtltscriptgtltLibrary for pageA gt  ltscript srcjsanimationlibpageB.jsgtltscriptgtltLibrary for pageB gt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pstrongInject.jsstrongp  precodefunction loadExternalHTMLPage   var xmlhttp var pagesToDisplay  [a.html, b.html] if window.XMLHttpRequest   xmlhttp  new XMLHttpRequest   else   xmlhttp  new ActiveXObjectMicrosoft.XMLHTTP   xmlhttp.onreadystatechange  function    if xmlhttp.readyState  4 ampamp xmlhttp.status  200   document.getElementByIdjsinsert.innerHTML  xmlhttp.responseText     var randomnumber  Math.floorMath.random  pagesToDisplay.length xmlhttp.openGET, pagesToDisplay[randomnumber], true xmlhttp.send    codepre  pMost JS Gurus should be able to see that Im randomly inserting a.html and b.html on page load, now this works but the problem is the scripts contained within a.html and b.html are not executing. using firebug I can clearly see that the scripts are being inserted as intended.p  pso for example a and b looks likep  pstronga.htmlstrongp  precodeltscriptgt window.onload  function   ltscriptgt codepre  pstrongb.htmlstrongp  precodeltscriptgt window.onload  function    ltscriptgt codepre  pBasically the code within A and B are valid and work fine within this insert and Ive filled the above examples as just a placeholder.

Negative 2149 pWere looking for a way to send per frame metadata for example an ID with H264 encoded frames from a server to a client.p  pWere currently developing a remote rendering application, where both client and server side are actively involved. The server renders a high quality image with all effects, lighting etc. The client also has modelinformations and renders a diffuse image that is used when the bandwidth is too low or the images have to be warped in order to avoid stuttering .p  pSo far were encoding the frames on the server side with ffmpeg and streaming them with live555 to the client, who receives an rtspstream and decodes the frames again using ffmpeg.p  pFor our application, we now need to send per frame metadata. We want the client to tell the server where the camera is right now.  Ideally wed be able to send the clients view matrix to the server, render the corresponding frame and send it back to the client together with its view matrix. So when the client receives a frame, we need to know exactly at what camera position the frame was rendered.p  pAlternatively we could also tag each view matrix with an ID, send it to the server, render the frame and tag it with the same ID and send it back. In this case wed have to assign the right matrix to the frame again on the client side.p  pAfter several attempts to realize the above intent with ffmpeg we came to the conclusion that ffmpeg does not provide the required functionality. ffmpeg only provides a fix, predefined set of fields for metadata, that either cannot store a matrix or can only be set for every key frame, which is not frequently enough for our purpose.p  pNow were considering using live555. So far we have an on demand Server, witch gets a VideoSubsession with aH264VideoStreamDiscreteFramer to contain our own FramedSource class. In this class we load the encoded AVPacket from ffmpeg and send its databuffer over the network. Now we need a way to send some kind of metadata with every frame to the client.p  pDo you have any ideas how to solve this metadata problem with live555 oder another libraryp  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 2149 pA friend of mine showed me a home exercise in a C course which he attend. Since I already know C, but just started learning Haskell I tried to solve the exercise in the Haskell way.p  pThese are the exercise instructions I translated from our native language so please comment if the instructions arent clearp  pWrite a program which reads nonzero coefficients A,B,C,D from the user and places them in the following equation Ax  By  Cz  D The program should also read from the user N, which represents a range. The program should find all possible integral solutions for the equation in the range N2 to N2.p  pFor examplep  precodeInput A  2,B  3,C  1, D  5, N  4 Output 1,2,1, 0,2, 1, 0,1,2, 1,1, 0, 2,1,2, 2,0, 1 codepre  pThe most straightforward algorithm is to try all possibilities by brute force. I implemented it in Haskell in the following wayp  precodetriSolve  Integer gt Integer gt Integer gt Integer gt Integer gt [Integer,Integer,Integer] triSolve a b c d n    let equation x y z  a  x  b  y  c  z  d       minN  div n 2       maxN  div n 2   in [x,y,z  x lt [minN..maxN], y lt [minN..maxN], z lt [minN..maxN], equation x y z] codepre  pSo far so good, but the exercise instructions note that a more efficient algorithm can be implemented, so I thought how to make it better. Since the equation is linear, based on the assumption that Z is always the first to be incremented, once a solution has been found theres no point to increment Z. Instead, I should increment Y, set Z to the minimum value of the range and keep going. This way I can save redundant executions. Since there are no loops in Haskell to my understanding at least I realized that such algorithm should be implemented by using a recursion. I implemented the algorithm in the following wayp  precodesolutions  Integer gt Integer gt Integer gt Bool gt Integer gt Integer gt Integer gt Integer gt Integer gt     [Integer,Integer,Integer] solutions f maxN minN x y z    solved  x,y,znextCall x y  1 minN    x gt maxN ampamp y gt maxN ampamp z gt maxN  []    z gt maxN ampamp y gt maxN  nextCall x  1 minN minN    z gt maxN  nextCall x y  1 minN    otherwise  nextCall x y z  1   where solved  f x y z         nextCall  solutions f maxN minN  triSolve  Integer gt Integer gt Integer gt Integer gt Integer gt [Integer,Integer,Integer] triSolve a b c d n    let equation x y z  a  x  b  y  c  z  d       minN  div n 2       maxN  div n 2   in solutions equation maxN minN minN minN minN codepre  pBoth yield the same results. However, trying to measure the execution time yielded the following resultsp  precodeMaingt length  triSolve 2 3 1 5 100 3398 2.81 secs, 971648320 bytes Maingt length  triSolve 2 3 1 5 100 3398 1.73 secs, 621862528 bytes codepre  pMeaning that the dumb algorithm actually preforms better than the more sophisticated one. Based on the assumption that my algorithm was correct which I hope wont turn as wrong  , I assume that the second algorithm suffers from an overhead created by the recursion, which the first algorithm isnt since its implemented using a list comprehension. Is there a way to implement in Haskell a better algorithm than the dumb one Also, Ill be glad to receive general feedbacks about my coding stylep

Negative 2149 pIm in the process of creating an application where we are fed several external product feeds daily, and we populate our products database with the feeds. However the trick is we need to keep the product db in sync with the latest feeds.p  pPreviously I had toyed with the theory of populating the current product list from db in an array, and doing array comparison with the latest feed, that got gunned down once the product count was in the thousands. Ran out of memory when trying to get a 5000 records.p  pSo after abit of research, it seems the solution would probably lie on the SQL side, using TRIGGERS perhaps. Though Im not quite sure how to go about it, hence my question.p  pSo the 2 objectives I need to accomplish with the syncing processp  p1 Insert new products that do not already exist in our db. We can accomplish this with the INSERT IGNORE method.p  p2 Find products on our DB that do NOT exist on the latest feed, and do something to them. flag as deleted, or move to a deleted products table, etc.p  pStep 2 is where Im having trouble. Im thinking now maybe for every sync operation, we insert the products from the latest feed into a TempProducts table, and somehow compare Products Table with TempProducts table in finding the records that need to be flagged as deleted.p  pAny advice pleasep  pThanksp

Negative 2149 pMy first post. Im experimenting with windows form and C. I have some basic questions. The goal so far is to write a program that check if a certain hardware is plugged in through an USB port, but before I get to the real work I wanted to finish the GUI that will inform whether or not the hardware was found.br So I have a standard form Form1.h,  then I have the cpp class in which the main method residesusbStatus.cpp and another cpp fileconnection.cpp in which Im planning to put the code to search for the wanted hardware. Right at start up the form is displaying a statusButton set with background color RED and a statusLabel saying Searching hardware. Then I would like that when the other code not written yet is finished searching for the hardware the button background color changes to green if HW found and label to Hardware  found. Well... nothing happens. I have checked with traces and the code is processed but without visible result. I have tried Invalidate and Refresh without success. p  pThe very little I have right now looks pretty much like this p  pForm1.hp  precodenamespace usbStatus      using namespace System     using namespace SystemComponentModel     using namespace SystemCollections     using namespace SystemWindowsForms     using namespace SystemData     using namespace SystemDrawing       ltsummarygt      Summary for Form1      ltsummarygt     public ref class Form1  public SystemWindowsFormsForm          public         Form1void                      InitializeComponent                          TODO Add the constructor code here                            ...      void InitializeComponentvoid               ...     thisgtstatusButton  gcnew SystemWindowsFormsToolStripButton     thisgtstatusLabel  gcnew SystemWindowsFormsToolStripLabel     ....      void InitializeComponentvoid          ...      codepre  pAt the end of the file Ive added the following methodp  precodepublic void Form1UpdateStatusElementsColor color       statusButtongtBackColor  color     if color  SystemDrawingColorGreen         statusprogressBargtEnabled  false         statusLabelgtText  Hardware found      else          ... codepre  pusbStatus.cppp  precodeinclude stdafx.h include Form1.h include Connection.h  using namespace UsbStatus   [STAThreadAttribute] int mainarrayltSystemString gt args        Enabling Windows XP visual effects before any controls are created     ApplicationEnableVisualStyles     ApplicationSetCompatibleTextRenderingDefaultfalse        Create the main window and run it     ApplicationRungcnew Form1     Form1 mainWindow  gcnew Form1     ApplicationRunmainWindow  ifConnectionGetStatus      mainWindowgtUpdateStatusElementsSystemDrawingColorGreen else     mainWindowgtUpdateStatusElementsSystemDrawingColorRed delete mainWindow return 0  codepre  pConnection.hp  precodepragma once include Form1.h    ref class Connection      private         static void CheckStatus         static void SetStatusbool connected         static bool hwConnected      public         static bool GetStatus   codepre  pConnection.cppp  precodeinclude ltwindows.hgt include Connection.h  using namespace UsbStatus  ...  bool ConnectionGetStatus      CheckStatus     return true     return hwConnected  codepre

Negative 2149 pIm looking for a way to expand numbers that are separated by slashes.  In addition to the slashes, parentheses, may be used around some or all numbers to indicate a group which may be repeated by the number of times directly following the parentheses or repeated in reverse followed by s as shown in the second set of examples.  Some examples arep  precode1          gt [1]                          gt No slashes, no parentheses 1234    gt [1, 2, 3, 4]           gt basic example with slashes 1243   gt [1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3] gt 2 gets repeated 4 times 12324 gt [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4] gt 23 is repeated 2 times 1232   gt [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3] gt Entire sequence is repeated twice 123s   gt [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1] gt Entire sequence is repeated in reverse 123s4 gt [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 4] gt 23 is repeated in reverse codepre  pIn the most general case, there could even be nested parentheses, which I know generally make the use of regex impossible.  In the current set of data I need to process, there are no nested sets like this, but I could see potential use for it in the future.  For examplep  precode12324s5 gt 12334s5                 gt 1233443325                 gt [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3, 2, 5] codepre  pI know of course that regex cannot do all of this especially with the repeatingreversing sets of parenthesis.  But if I can get a regex that at least separates the strings of parenthesis from those not in parenthesis, then I could probably make some loop pretty easily to take care of the rest.  So, the regex Id be looking for would do something likep  precode1               gt [1] 1234         gt [1, 2, 3, 4] 1243        gt [1, 24, 3] 12324      gt [1, 232, 4] 12324s5 gt [1, 2324s, 5] codepre  pAnd then I could loop on this result and continue expanding any parentheses until I have only digits.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI wasnt totally clear in my original post.  In my attempt to make the examples as simple as possible, I perhaps oversimplified them.  This needs to work for numbers  10 as well as negative numbers.p  pFor examplep  precode11523s4   gt [1, 1523s, 4]                 gt [1, 15, 23, 23, 15, 4] codepre

Negative 2149 pThanks to everyone that has gotten me this far The following works, but I cannot figure out how to return more than 1 row including all of the current column names.

Any help would be awesome and thanks.p  precode    SELECT  club.id, club.name, club.status, users.firstname, users.lastname, users.rights,  SUM job.status gt 0  AS total,  SUM job.status  1  AS incomplete,  SUM job.status  2  AS pending,  SUM job.status  3  AS live,  SUM job.status  4  AS closed  FROM club  LEFT JOIN surveys  ON job.clubid  club.id  LEFT JOIN users  ON users.id  job.usersid  WHERE job.status gt 0 codepre

Negative 2149 pLet me ask two coupled questions that might boil down to one about good application design p  ol liWhat is the best practice for using event based communication in an e4 RCP applicationli liHow can I write simple unit tests using JUnit for classes that sendreceive events using dependency injection and IEventBroker li ol  pLets be more concrete say I am developing an Eclipse e4 RCP application consisting of several plugins that need to communicate. For communication I want to use the event service provided by org.eclipse.e4.core.services.events.IEventBroker so my plugins stay loosely coupled. I use dependency injection to inject the event broker to a class that dispatches eventsp  precodeInject static IEventBroker broker  private void sendEvent  broker.postMyEventConstants.SOMEEVENT, payload  codepre  pOn the receiver side, I have a method likep  precodeInject Optional private void receiveEventUIEventTopicMyEventConstants.SOMEEVENT Object payload  codepre  pNow the questionsp  ol lipIn order for IEventBroker to be successfully injected, my class needs access to the current IEclipseContext. Most of my classes using the event service are not referenced by the e4 application model, so I have to manually inject the context on instantiation using e.g. codeContextInjectionFactory.injectmyEventSendingObject, contextcode This approach works but I find myself passing around a lot of context to wherever I use the event service. Is this really the correct approach to event based communication across an E4 application pli liphow can I easily write JUnit tests for a class that uses the event service either as a sender or receiver Obviously, none of the above annotations work in isolation since there is no context available. I understand everyones convinced that dependency injection simplifies testability. But does this also apply to injecting services like the IEventBrokerpli ol  pa hrefhttpwww.vogella.comarticlesEclipse4Testingarticle.html relnofollowThis articlea describes creation of your own IEclipseContext to include the process of DI in tests. Not sure if this could resolve my 2nd issue but I also hesitate running all my tests as JUnit Plugin tests as it appears impractible to fire up the PDE for each unit test. Maybe I just misunderstand the approach.p  pa hrefhttptomsondev.bestsolution.at20110207enhancedrcphowviewscancommunicatethee4way relnofollowThis articlea speaks about simply mocking IEventBroker. Yes, that would be great Unfortunately, I couldnt find any information on how this can be achieved.p  pAll this makes me wonder whether I am still on the right track or if this is already a case of bad design  And if so, how would you go about redesigning Move all event related actions to dedicated event senderreceiver classes or a dedicated plugin p

Negative 2149 pSo I wrote this simple tab navigation. It has two tabs called Fragment 1 and Fragment 2. If you hit either one, it should display respective texts Fragment 1 or Fragment 2 in the content area.

Negative 2149 pI have a weird problem. Cant explain this inconsistent behavior. Please helpp  pNormally I would expect that the first GET request to load my default.aspx to fire the SessionOnStart event. However, this happens only on the first page load after restarting the IIS. On all subsequent page loads after clearing cookies, SessionOnStart does not fire on the first GET request.  p  pThe page also makes two other POST requests from the client side through jQuery Ajax. SessionOnStart does fire for BOTH of these requests on all subsequent page loads again after clearing cookies. p  pThis is a problem because SessionId is not being set on the first response, rather its being set twice on the subsequent responses to the POST requests. So the application ends up creating two SessionIds for each user. And again this does not happen on the first page load right after the IIS restart, which is the weird part.p  pit is an asp.net 3.5 website running on IIS 7.  p

Negative 2149 pstrongUPDATE Thanks Michal Gajdos for the solution, but would still like to know if theres a way to do this that is not specific to Jersey if anyone has any ideas.strongp  pIve created some JAXRS 2.0 resources using Jeresey 2.4 running in a Servlet container and a filter that handles authentication and authorisation that can be selectively applied via a NameBinding annotation. This all works great.p  pI would like to be able to define some parameters on this annotation specifically, security permissions that are required to access each methodresource that can be available to the filter at runtime to alter this behaviour.p  pI notice that interceptors can do this via javax.ws.rs.ext.InterceptorContext.getAnnotations but there is no equivalent in javax.ws.rs.container.ContainerRequestContext for filters.

Negative 2149 pI am writing a code in C which  updates a data file with a 2d matrix in a format p  precodeX1  Y1 Z1  X2  Y2 Z2 ... codepre  pMy X domain is from 1 to 1 and Y domain is also from 1 to 1. The file has about 2500 values as I have discretized my X and Y domain in 50 points each so total number of ZValues are 2500. I want to plot these values in the XY domain to generate contour plot of Zvalue 0. Since the file is continously updated, I want to draw at certain intervals of time via program automatically so that I can see the contour evolution after each period of time. Since I need to see the temporal evolution of contour, I do not want to plot the data at the end of code.p  pCurrently I am using MAC osX mavericks. I am using GCC compiler and using GNUPlot via popen command to send data to GNUPlot. The problem now I am facing is that GNUplot is invoked only after my code exitsfinishes running time 6 secs and then the output is plotted one by one at different time. I want the plots to come while the code is still running like in matlab and not when the code finishes. This way I can see a diiferent contour plot at every .5 seconds and see the evolution. Since the complexity of code is going to increase from now onwards, the running time will go  to upto 10 mins. So, I want to see the evolution as my code progresses and not at the end. p  pThen i thought of switching to MathGL. I tried using MathGl but in its installation for mac I am getting the error  ldconfing not found on MAC. p  pI am still stuck in the process and cannot find the way to do the same.p  pI am open to use any library that fulfills my purpose. Please  suggest me some Library for plotting in C and if possible some example codes to plot contours while getting data from my file.p  pPS. The format of the file containing data can be modified according to the library.p

Negative 2149 pImagine I have a library of books, each with a genre.  Each of these books is stored in my database.  My website allows users to retrieve lists of books that exist in the library by searching on any permutation of different genres. I know that certain searches will occur more than others, so the results are precomputed and cached.  Other searches are far more rare, and I am comfortable hitting the database on request and then caching the result afterwards in the database. The client does not know which queries have been cached and which have not, and thus it does not know if the server will make DB changes or not. So how does the client know whether to GET or POSTp  pA few clarificationsp  ol lipMy queries are far more complicated that just genre. There are many factors besides genre that can compose a query, but I am keeping the example simple. Long story short, I cannot precompute and cache all possible queries.pli lipEveryone says code first, optimize later. Heeding this advice, I am not caching the DB results in memory using memcache or redis.  Rather, I am simply storing the results of my queries in special DB tables.

I dont need to use it in every call, however Im creating it in every call from my codes structure. So, I just made this small class upp  precodeltphp namespace Library   Wrapper for PDO. It only creates the rather expensive instance when needed.  Use it exactly as youd use the normal PDO object, except for the creation.  In that case simply do new LibraryPDOargs with the normal args class PDO       The actual instance of PDO   private db    public function construct      thisgtargs  funcgetargs         public function callmethod, args          if emptythisgtdb              Ref  new ReflectionClassPDO       thisgtdb  RefgtnewInstanceArgsthisgtargs             return calluserfuncarrayarraythisgtdb, method, args         codepre  pTo call it you only need to modify this linep  precodeDB  new LibraryPDO normal arguments  codepre  pAnd the typehinting if you are using it to codeLibraryPDO DBcode.p  pIt works flawlessly. Its also blazing fast 0.2ms when not using the PDO object and only introduces those 0.2ms delay when using it completely negligible. Now, Im still learning about proper OOP, namespaces and general code structure, so I think Im not qualified enough as to answer my own question yetp  pstrongWill I encounter any technical difficulty by using this wrapper class later onstrong Why I havent seen anything like this before therefore, why is this not more common or even default PDO behaviourp  pNote I intend to extend it furthermore by adding few more methods.p

Negative 2149 pQuite often when I make VCL programs, I run into a scenario like this p  ul liI have a number of components on the form, that the users are allowed to fiddle with. Most commonly a bunch of edit boxes.li liThe contents of these edit boxes need to be verified by the OnChange event when the user types in stuff manually.li liSomewhere else on the form, theres some component that the user can click on to get some default values loaded into the edit boxes in TEditText.li ul  pNow what I want is that whenever the user is typing something in the TEditText, the OnChange event must process the user input. But when my program is setting the TEditText to a default value, this isnt necessary, because then I know that the value is correct.p  pUnfortunately, writing code like codemyeditgtText  Defaultcode triggers the OnChange event.p  pI tend to solve this with what I think is a rather ugly approach by creating a bool variable codeisuserinputcode, which codeTEditOnChangecode checks. If it is true, the TEditText will get validated, otherwise it will get ignored. But of course, this doesnt prevent the program from launching codeTEditOnChangecode when it is unnecessary.p  pIs there a better or cleaner way to achieve this p  pIs there a way for OnChange to check who called it Or I suppose, a way of disabling the OnChange event temporarily would be even better. codeTEditEnabledcode doesnt seem to affect whether codeOnChangecode gets triggered or not.p

Negative 2149 pMy situation is, I have 2 dropdown list and only one data from one of the dropdown list will be sent into the second page. Thats mean, the data from another dropdown list will not be sent. So, I choose to display the dropdown list by using the radio button. If I choose the 1st button, it will only display the 1st dropdown list and vice versa. p  pThe problem is, when I choose the 1st dropdown list, it doesnt send any POST data from the dropdown list to the second page, only blank. But, if I choose the 2nd dropdown list, it send the data properly I thought that there are errors in 1st dropdown list codes even both codes are practically identical. So, I add another list, and this time, only the 3rd dropdown lists data is sent. 1st and 2nd list doesnt send anything. p  pI realize that my problem is my codes only sent data from the last dropdown list, not both. I only need 1 data from either dropdown list, but I need both to function. If I can only choose one list, I dont even need to make 2 dropdown list.p  pThis is my codes, but not a full code. The other data works fine, only the dropdown list is having problem. p  precodeltform namelist actionindex.phpsite11 methodpostgt ltscriptgt function check ifdocument.getElementById1H.checked      document.getElementByIdD1H.style.display  block     document.getElementByIdD2H.style.display  none  else      document.getElementByIdD1H.style.display  none     document.getElementByIdD2H.style.display  block  ltscriptgt Choose ltinput typeradio onclickjavascriptcheck nameduration id1Hgt1 Hour ltinput typeradio onclickjavascriptcheck nameduration id2Hgt2 Hour  Choose time slot ltdiv idD1H styledisplaynonegt     ltselect nametime1 gt      ltoption valuegtChooseltoptiongt      ltoption value89gt800am900amltoptiongt     ltselectgt ltdivgt ltdiv idD2H styledisplaynonegt     ltselect nametime2 gt      ltoption valuegtChooseltoptiongt      ltoption value810gt800am1000amltoptiongt     ltselectgt ltdivgt ltinput typesubmit namesubmit valueNextgt codepre  pThis is php codes to show how I receive the POST data, just until the query.p  precodeinclude..includedbconnect.php user  SESSION[username]  ifissetPOST[submit]  ifissetPOST[time] labPOST[lab] dayPOST[day] monthPOST[month] yearPOST[year] timePOST[time]  echo 1.time  results  mysqlquerySELECT COUNT FROM booking WHERE lab  .lab.

Negative 2149 pBasically I want to be able to somehow generate an image that has a list of stats for a player. I need to be able to draw text onto the image and maybe the players avatar onto it if possible. I also want to avoid using any libraries unless I have to unless you have an easy way to do this using X library. I know how to make this using a simple php request since most of the information will be retrieved from various databases anyway, but I would prefer to have a way to make it directly in the program so I can change it easily.

Negative 2149 pThis might be more of an opinion based question, but Ill continue anywayp  pI have many functions that get multiple values from remote devices and I need to use the most up to date values when I do my calculations. Being that its a remote device, I have to use device specific getters when asking for the values.p  pemIm using the telnetlib, but I assume thats irrelevantem p  pIn actual use, its safe to assume Ill have around 10 devices, and 10 values to get from each. There is a chance that the communication with the device will fail and raise an exception. In this case all the data I collected will be useless seeing as I need all of it do my calculations, and I shouldnt save it because it wont be the most up to date values later.p  pSo far my functions looks like this... the main idea being that if any of the getters fail, the append lines will not be executedp  precodedef GetTraitsobjectlist     traitdict  Foo[],Bar[]     for obj in objectlist         try             Foo  obj.GetFoo             Bar  obj.GetBar             traitdict[Foo].appendFoo             traitdict[Bar].appendBar         except Exception as e             print e              None type will be handled by other functions that need these values             traitdict[Foo].appendNone             traitdict[Bar].appendNone     return traitdict codepre  pThis however feels like a lot of very redundant code seeing as I could have 10 traits in that dictionary.p  pAny ideas on how to improve this code Thanks in advancep  pCalp

Negative 2149 pI realize this question has been asked before but I didnt find any answers that actually resolved it, so...asking again.p  pIm using ARC. My app takes photos from an AVCaptureSession at periodic intervals and saves them to core data. I get the NSData object by calling UIImagePNGRepresentation. As this is happening, memory steadily climbs and the app eventually quits due to memory pressure...but there are no leaks. Instruments shows that for each photo, 500k is being malloced and it never gets released.p  pThe answer I keep coming across is to wrap UIImagePNGRepresentation, or indeed the whole method body, in an autoreleasepool, but this did not help.p  pI am reasonably certain that the UIImagePNGRepresentation call is the culprit, because when I comment it out, no more memory problems or images to save.p  pWould appreciate any help here...is there another way to grab NSData from a UIImage Is this just another SDK bug we have to live withp  precodevoidphotoTimerFiredNSTimertimer   ...

Negative 2149 pFor my first IOS app I plan to incorporate CoreData however Im a little unsure about the correct design pattern I should use. p  pIn my app delegate I have the following 3 properties.p  precodeproperty readonly, strong, nonatomic NSManagedObjectContext managedObjectContext property readonly, strong, nonatomic NSManagedObjectModel managedObjectModel property readonly, strong, nonatomic NSPersistentStoreCoordinator persistentStoreCoordinator codepre  pI feel the best way to use these objects are to inject them into the constructor of all the relevant view controllers that need to access data from inside CoreData.p  pThe cleanest way I can think of for that would be to create some kind of Repository class for each table I have in my data model which will house the above 3 objects and provide helper methods for accessing the tables data e.g. fetchAllTeams. These repository classes can then be injected into the relevant view controllers instead of injecting all 3 objects above.p  pDoes this sound like the correct thing to be doing in the world of CoreData amp Objectivecp  pAlso whats the best way to create these repository classes, should I remove the default core data code and properties from the appDelegate generated automatically and place them inside an abstract repository class.p  pShould each instance of a repository have its own version of NSPersistentStoreCoordinator, NSManagedObjectModel and NSManagedObjectContext or should a single instance of these objects be shared among all repository instances passed in by the appDelegate.p

Negative 2149 pIm having some trouble with a JPA query. I should tell you now, Im not an expert in JPA at all.p  pI have two classes, codeLinecode and codeLineDatacode.p  pThe relationship between codeLinecode and codeLineDatacode is that a Line can potentially have 100s of codeLineDatacode objects associated to it. The reason I havent explicitly joined them is because most of the time when I retrieve a codeLinecode entity, I dont need the codeLineDatacode and seeing as there could be 100s, it would be a waste to load them all and then not use them.p  pHowever, what I would like to be able to do, when retrieving a codeLinecode entity, is get the maximum codeLineData.value1code value as well and return that as a part of the codeLinecode entity, as codeLine.maxVal1code . Ive tried doing this with the following queryp  precodeSELECT l, l.maxVal1  SELECT MAXd.value1 FROM LineData d WHERE d.name  l.name FROM Line l WHERE l.name  example123 ORDER BY l.name ASC codepre  pBut codeLine.maxVal1code is coming back as codenullcode.

Negative 2149 pIve been creating NuGet packages for some of my libraries. The goal is to have my Jenkins build server use a CoApp .autopkg script to build a NuGet package that I can then use in other projects.p  pThe issue is that the build server uses the standalone Windows 7.1 SDK rather than Visual Studio 2010.  I guess this is a separate Platform Toolset So essentially, I cant use the packages compiled by the build server in my Visual Studio 2010 projects  Do people normally install a copy of Visual Studio on their build serversp

I was able to link the OpenEars framework by putting it in the same folder as my private frameworks, and Im currently trying to get the tutorial code to work.

This means that when the listening loop begins, it will crash due to the missing required resources. The problem finding the acoustic model bundle could be because the name of the bundle was not given to this method in a way it can use for instance, if you are trying to use the English acoustic model and you have added that bundle to your app project, you would invoke this method by passing code[AcousticModel pathToAcousticModelAcousticModelEnglish]code or code[AcousticModel pathToAcousticModelAcousticModelSpanish]code for the Spanish bundle, without appending .bundle to the end, and making sure that the bundle name is spelled exactly as it appears in the actual bundle name the bundle can be seen in this distributions folder Framework. p  pIf this doesnt fix the problem, it is very likely to be due to the fact that the acoustic model bundle wasnt imported successfully into the root level of your app project and its mainBundle. This usually happens either because the acoustic model bundle was never dragged into your app project when the Framework folder was originally supposed to be dragged in, or because it was dragged in but instead of using the setting Create groups for any added folders in Xcodes Add Files dialog, the option Create folder references for any added folders was unintentionally chosen. To fix this, just remove the acoustic model bundle or the Framework folder from your app and add it again to your app project with the correct setting of Create groups for any added folders in Xcodes Add Files dialog.p  pI also get these messages in my syslogp  precodeMay 27 005449 PhillipsiPhone SpringBoard[17785] ltWarninggt acousticModelPath is null May 27 005449 PhillipsiPhone SpringBoard[17785] ltWarninggt Error the default phonetic dictionary nullLanguageModelGeneratorLookupList.text cant be found in the app bundle but the app is attempting to access it, most likely there will be a crash now.

Negative 2149 pI am learning git and I am developing a small app with it. On my codeGithubcode repository I have two branches codemastercode and codecontributionscode and two contributors. The codemastercode branch is for release phase and the codecontributioncode branch is for development and testing. Me and my team commit codes on codecontributioncode branch. Our problem is that when we wanted to test each others contribution codes, we dont how to do it well. We tried codepullcode, codepull requestscode and codemergingrebasecode but I think its not working the way we wanted it to be. We wanted to get the copies of all the commits of our team members to be tested on our local machines. We are developing a web app using codelaravel frameworkcode and as usual we are testingrunning the app on our codelocalhostcode. The problem is that we dont know if it is possible to get those commits and update our branches with the changes and without changing the architecture or structure of our codemastercode branch. Can someone please enlighten us if how we could actually do this Thank you.p
Negative 2149 pSo Im trying to get a hang of using delegates, and Ive watched a few tutorials on how to use them so far. I still find them confusing and after trying to implement one myself, have an issue that I cant seem to solve.p  pI have two ViewControllers, the first one codeViewControllercode contains a codeUITextField sampleTextFieldcode and a button with the method codeswitchViewscode. It also contains the protocol declaration with the method codesendTextToViewControllercode. codeSwitchViewscode is also linked to a segue that switches to the codeSecondViewControllercode. In codeSecondViewControllercode the only object is a codeUILabel outputLabelcode When the user taps the button, it calls codeswitchViewscode and the view changes to SecondViewController, and upon loading codeoutputLabelcode should be changed to whatever text was entered in codesampleTextFieldcode in codeViewControllercode. However the delegate method codesendTextToViewControllercode is never being called. All objects are created in Interface Builder.p  pHere is the code to make it a bit easier to understandp  pstrongViewController.hstrongp  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt  protocol TextDelegate ltNSObjectgt  voidsendTextToViewControllerNSString stringText  end  interface ViewController  UIViewController   IBActionswitchViewsidsender  property weak, nonatomic IBOutlet UITextField sampleTextField  property weak, nonatomic idltTextDelegategtdelegate  end codepre  pThen declared this in strongViewController.mstrongp  precode IBActionswitchViewsidsender      NSLog, self.sampleTextField.text     [self.delegate sendTextToViewControllerself.sampleTextField.text]  codepre  pstrongSecondViewController.hstrongp  precodeimport ltUIKitUIKit.hgt import ViewController.h  interface SecondViewController  UIViewController ltTextDelegategt  property weak, nonatomic IBOutlet UILabel outputLabel   end codepre  pstrongSecondViewController.mstrongp  precodeimport SecondViewController.h  interface SecondViewController   end  implementation SecondViewController synthesize outputLabel   idinitWithNibNameNSString nibNameOrNil bundleNSBundle nibBundleOrNil      self  [super initWithNibNamenibNameOrNil bundlenibBundleOrNil]     if self            return self    voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      Do any additional setup after loading the view.

Negative 2149 pThe title maybe a bit complicated but I didnt see any other way of verbalizing my problem.p  pIm working on a project where certain components are initialized by loading several files and transforming them into Java components, others are loaded by a ServiceLoader as they are alreaddy existing as Java classes. All of these objects are then mapped by a provider so that they can be retrieved from there.p  precodepublic class Provider       private MapltString, Componentgt map      public Provider                     Load files, transform, and add them to the map            with keys being their names                              Load Java components and add them to the map            with keys being their names                     public Component getComponentString name          return this.map.getname        public interface Component      public Number execute  codepre  pI am now about to add some more components directly in Java but they are more of a composite meaning that they use components which were previously loaded into the provider. Hence, I must gather the required components from the provider, add them to the composite and add the composite itself to the provider.p  precodepublic class Composite implements Component      private Component component1, component2      public Composite          Provider provider  new Provider         this.component1  provider.getComponentComp1         this.component2  provider.getComponentComp2           public Number execute          return this.component1.execute  this.component2.execute       codepre  pThe composite can be added to the Provider by simply adding it to a specific METAINF file. Then it will be handled by the ServiceLoader.p  pFor me, this is somehow a cyclic dependency. I have to define, in a METAINF file, which Java classes should be gathered by the ServiceLoader. This would include the newly implemented composite as well. But that one cannot be created as long as all the other metrics have been loaded by the provider.p  pIs there any pattern or different approach I can use to solve that problemp
Negative 2149 pThis should be easy, how difficult can it be.p  pI have a document based core data application with a very simple data model.p  pI have a node entity with a parentchildren relationship to itself controlled by a NSTreeController, and viewed through an NSOutlineView. The node also has a non optional to one relationship to another entity type nodeProperties which is managed by a NSArrayController. I have NSManagedObject sublasses for both of the entities. My document class has outlets bound to both the tree controller and array controller instances.p  pMy problem is how to ensure that, when a new node is created by a user interface action in the outline view, its relation to a suitable preexisting nodeProperties object is populated.p  pApproaches I have tried  consideredp  ol lipLet the tree controller create the node from its add, addChild actions  and populate the relationship to a nodeProperties object in the node subclass awakeFromInsert method. The trouble is I cannot find a means of accessing any nodeProperties object from within the nodes awakeFromInsert. The appropriate nodeProperties object is available from a method in the document class, but accessing the document object from the node awakeFromInsert method seems to break the principles of MVC, and I have read that the shared document object is not always safe in a drag and drop operation which in my case also creates a new node objectpli lipWrite add and addChild action methods in the document class and invoke these from the end user actions instead of the tree controller My drag and drop support is also in the document class. Then from within these methods invoke the add and addChild methods in the tree controller, then set the nodeProperties relationship on the newly created node. The trouble is I dont know how to ask the tree controller to give me a reference to the newly created node I have tried using the selectedObjects method to get the parent, and then comparing the parents children before and after the add to get the new node. But the children content does not change at this time  perhaps it is a delayed updatepli lipAs a variant of 2, dont use the tree controller addaddChild methods at all, but instead create the node entity object in the document addaddChild methods using the tree controllers selectedOjects to get the parent. I dont really like this since it seems like doing something behind the tree controllers back, and I would have to setContent each time I created root objects.pli lipI have considered the possibility of observing the creation of the newly created node, but I dont know what to observe to achieve that.pli ol  pSomeone must have done something like this before  but I trawled to no avail. All help, advice, guidance would be very welcome.p

I could dop  precodemynewfunc  [x2 for x in l]  l is not defined codepre  pThen somewhere later in the codep  precodemynewfuncrange10  Returns the answer codepre  pThis is a very good functional programming way of doing things.p  pstrongSecond Editstrongp  pHeres a way to do what I want, but I wonder if there is a better methodp  precodeboomBangs  lambda lst [actual list comprehension]  boomBangsrange10 codepre

Negative 2149 pI have one doubt regarding the usage of TPL with the LongRunning state. p  pFrom MSDN  The purpose of the TPL is to make developers more productive by simplifying the process of adding parallelism and concurrency to applications. The TPL strongscales the degree of concurrency dynamically to most efficiently use all the processor cores that are available.strong Another benefit of the TPL is, that strongyou dont have to deal with thread creation and synchronization.strongp  pBut if I set the LongRunning option, TPL assigns a dedicated thread from outside of thread pool. So in that case it will work some what similar to the traditional threading What I believe, please correct if I am wrong. So in such a scenario, will TPL itself deal with thread creation and synchronization as mentioned above Also will it automaticallyinternally scales the degree of concurrency dynamically to most efficiently use all the processor cores or developer need to write code to handle all thosep

However, I decided to try to use two views because Im using the Djangos actual login view django.contrib.auth.views.login so that I can add code to it to detect the users device phone, tablet, or computer, and merging that view with my signup view would create a very long and complicated view to maintain.

And I dont think I need to pass the other view arguments in the form action e.g. redirectfieldname because their  optional.  In any case, adding this argument to the form action didnt fix it.p  pOne of the things that confuses me is how to set the first url argument.  Ive set them to rsignin and rsignup because if I set them both to r, the page will render properly but when I submit either form, it justs posts back to the home page.  You can see this will happen by doing a view source on the page. It shows each forms action will be .  On the other hand, the way I have it now seems incorrect to me because the site wont actually have a signin and signup URL since both forms are on the home page.  Also, is there going to be a problem in which if the user submits one for or the other improperly, errors for both forms will be rendered on the page  p  pThe Django documentation, to the best of my knowledge, doesnt really describe a standard approach for doing what Im trying to do.  It describes how to render multiple versions of the same form.  Can anyone tell me what Im doing wrongp  pThanks.p

Negative 2149 pBackground Im in a largecode environment where the undefined order in which global constructors are run is problematic.  So I have a custom class that is designed to delay initialization until firstuse.  All its magic occurs inside its operator and operator functions theyre the only thing defined.  It also stores some state within itself, to make available to the automaticinitialization function.  That state must, of course, be POD, so that the whole class is POD, so that it can be completely set up before anyones code starts running, so that all code everywhere can use all globals everywhere, without fear that the globals havent been set up yet.p  pA while back someone added a private, neverdefined assignment operator, so that the type would never be assigned to its not designed to ever change anyway.  Now someone else is saying the class is broken because its not POD.  If instead of it being declaredbutnotdefined, I declare it as delete, Im thinking thats somehow better.  And indeed, with that change, stdispodltvalue returns true for the type.p  pBut does as assignment operator prevent a type from being POD  I thought the requirements were just that it had to have only public data members, no virtual methods, and no constructor or destructor.p  pAnd more to the point for my situation does the presence of a neverdefined assignment operator prevent the class from being able to be initialized at global initialization time, along with all the other global PODsp  pReduced examplep  precodestruct LazyString    const char cstr    bool hasbeeninited   string lazystrdonotusedirectly    string ampoperator  return get    string operatorgt  return get    private   string get       The real code uses a mutex, of course, to be threadsafe.     if hasbeeninited        lazystrdonotusedirectly  new stringcstr       hasbeeninited  true          return lazystrdonotusedirectly        Does this make the class nonPOD    If so, does that mean that global variables of this type    will not be initialized at globalinitialization time, that wonderful    moment in time where no code has yet been run   void operatorconst LazyStringamp     If I do this instead, it breaks C03 compatibility, but is this somehow better   void operatorconst LazyStringamp  delete   LazyString lazy   lazy   int mainint argc, char argv[]    stdcout ltlt lazy  codepre

Negative 2149 pIm trying to work out the best way to split my application into a few CommonJS modules that can be consumed by other applications.p  pI have 5 TS classes, and Id like to bundle them as a single CommonJS module.

Negative 2149 pI need to export stronglarge quantities of datastrong to strongXML filestrong from strongOracle databasestrong. Size of exported files may vary from few MB to few hundred MB few MB most of the time. The structure of exported object strongis nestedstrong on few levels tree of objects. Each nesting level tree level is a separate table. Exported data are filtered by few properties on each level. I am using strong.NET frameworkstrong to execute the whole process.p  pThe structure looks something like that names modified due to NDAp  precodePackages  MajorVersions  MinorVersions  Features lots                                                                                                         Excludes Includes Rules lots                                                                                                                                     A     B    C  codepre  pI search Rules that might be filtered by package or version or feature or all of them. And I want to export those Rules with appropriate parent information, so XML looks like the structure.p  pWhat kind of solution is appropriate here efficient, with maintainable code Actually we are rewriting old system that executed those exports very slowly. It loaded each level to the memory, loading every child by id, so it might have performed for example about 20k requests to database to prepare an export. Then after recreating the whole object structure in the memory it serialized it to the XML. After that it performed some XSLT transformation. So export of 40MB file with about 20k Rules lasted about 30 minutes. We want to make it much more efficient and I am considering few optionsp  ol liCreate Sql query with multiple JOINS from the top to the bottom of the tree to retrieve the most meaningful data with one select. Use ADO.NET to sequentially retrieve data with SqlDataReader and write them sequentially to the file with XMLWriter in a loop fetch row, write XML entry. Meanwhile fetch less meaningful data like Excludes or Includes or load some rows at once into the memory if there are not many of them. Low memory usage seems to be an advantage here.li liUse ORM NHibernate to filter objects, load them to memory and later save to XML. It will probably be easier to implement and maintain. But it seems that ORMs are not designed to handle large data quantity cases.li liUse Oracle XML creation mechanism. I dont know whether it is possible to execute it with .NET and whether its efficient. The database is located on a remote server.li ol  pDo you have any suggestionsp

So if I instantiate an object in IB and give it a class of ComMycompanyPreferenceSoundPref, it will not see any of the outlets, nor will it allow other objects with a proper IBOutlet to hook up to it.p  pOnly if I use the SoundPref class will IB be happy. Of course when I compile my code, it translates the SoundPref into ComMycompanyPreferenceSoundPref and nothing works because the objects in IB are not using the ComMycompanyPreference class name prefix.p  pI really do not want to have to use ridiculous long names like ComMycompanyPreferenceSoundPref throughout my source files and Xcode 4 and 5 made this possible.p  pDoes anyone know how to make this work in Xcode 6 or some other way to use define or some other technique to allow this to work againp
Negative 2149 pI have code that successfully creates a calendar item on a public calendar.  I might be changing parameters on it startend dates, new optionalrequired attendees, changes to the body, etc. using my code.  As long as no one changes startend dates, my code works great because I know how to grammatically locate it.p  pAs long as no one moves that calendar item, fine.  But any user with access to the calendar can change the details on their own.  Once they for example move that appointment to another datetime, I can no longer find it with my code.  Any changes to that appointment prevents me from finding and changing it in the future.p  pSo far there doesnt seem to be a unique id that stays with the calendar item independent of whats changed.  Any ideas ex. I checked into entryIDStoreID, and neither are helpful since they apply to all appointment items.p

Negative 2149 pI just upgraded to Yosemite and noticing problems with MAMP. I was running Piwik locally port 7788 before the upgrade, and it worked perfectly. Now, however, when I start MAMP I just get a code500 Internal Server Errorcode.p  pSome searching around suggested that one issue was that MAMP was using Port 8888 for Apache and 8889 for MySQL, whereas they should now be changed to Port 80 and 3306 respectively the default ones for those apps. This didnt change anything for me though. p  pI also read it could be an issue around PHP and a suggestion was to go to codeetcapache2httpd.confcode and uncomment the line codeLoadModule php5module libexecapache2libphp5.socode, again this did nothing.  I dont know enough about Apache2MySQLPHP to trawl through them and figure anything out so Im hoping someone here can suggest how I go about correcting this. p

On an aside, If someone could elaborate on what the specific difference is between the const expressions before and after the function header that would be greatp  precodereturn mCharArrayArray  index codepre  pyieldsp  precodeerror returning reference to temporary  codepre  pandp  precodereturn mCharArrayArray[index] codepre  pyieldsp  precodeerror invalid initialization of reference of type CharArray constamp from expression of type CharArray codepre  pIve also tried multiple other variations having pointer and reference symbols before the return value. So what am I missing here I was thinking that returning a reference is just an address and adding the value of index to that address would yield the address of the desired CharArray.p
Negative 2149 pI am new to IOS development. I have a TabBarController with 2 tabs. The 1st TabItem is a map  with an annotation of one famous place such as Summer Palace in Beijing. When User touches the annotation pin, the annotation view appears with a detailed information button at the right side of the annotation. When users clicks the detailed information button, the 2nd ViewController appears with for example a label whose text should be the annotation title or subtitle of the 1st ViewController annotation. What I have succeeded is I can switch to 2nd ViewController by self.tabBarController.selectedIndex  1. I have no navigation controller and I have not created a TabBarController class filep  pThe 1st ViewController containing a mapp  precodeimport UIKit import MapKit  class ViewController1 UIViewController, MKMapViewDelegate         IBOutlet weak var theMapView MKMapView     override func viewDidLoad          super.viewDidLoad           Do any additional setup after loading the view.         var latitude CLLocationDegrees  39.9921996510         var longitude CLLocationDegrees  116.2684305217         var latDelta CLLocationDegrees  10         var longDelta CLLocationDegrees  10         var theSpan MKCoordinateSpan  MKCoordinateSpanMakelatDelta, longDelta         var churchLocation CLLocationCoordinate2D  CLLocationCoordinate2DMakelatitude, longitude         var theRegion MKCoordinateRegion  MKCoordinateRegionMakechurchLocation, theSpan         theMapView.setRegiontheRegion, animated true          theMapView.zoomEnabled  true         var annotationYiheyuan  MKPointAnnotation         annotationYiheyuan.coordinate  churchLocation         annotationYiheyuan.title  The Summer Palace         annotationYiheyuan.subtitle  The Most Famous Garden in Qing Dynasty          theMapView.addAnnotationannotationYiheyuan           override func didReceiveMemoryWarning          super.didReceiveMemoryWarning          Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.          func mapViewmapView MKMapView, annotationView view MKAnnotationView, calloutAccessoryControlTapped control UIControl          if control  view.rightCalloutAccessoryView               self.tabBarController.selectedIndex  1                    func mapViewmapView MKMapView, viewForAnnotation annotation MKAnnotation gt MKAnnotationView           if annotation is MKUserLocation              return nil so map view draws blue dot for standard user location             return nil                  let reuseId  pin          var anView  mapView.dequeueReusableAnnotationViewWithIdentifierreuseId          if anView  nil              anView  MKPinAnnotationViewannotation annotation, reuseIdentifier reuseId              anView.canShowCallout  true             anView.enabled  true             let button UIButton   UIButton.buttonWithTypeUIButtonType.DetailDisclosure as UIButton              anView.rightCalloutAccessoryView  button                   else              anView.annotation  annotation                   return anView        codepre  pThe 2nd ViewControllerp  precodeimport UIKit  class ViewController2 UIViewController        IBOutlet weak var lbl2VC2 UILabel     override func viewDidLoad          super.viewDidLoad           Do any additional setup after loading the view.           override func didReceiveMemoryWarning          super.didReceiveMemoryWarning          Dispose of any resources that can be recreated.        codepre

When John fills in the form today, a new row should be created with the date of today, with his value in the database.

Negative 2149 pI have a custom linux prompt which displays various useful nuggets of information.  As I use SVN in my daily job I thought it would be nice to further customize my prompt with information as to the current workspace URL.  This was mostly prompted by a recent case where I had switched to a branch then forgot I had done so.  Confusion abounded so, in a bid to avoid this happening again, I thought this seemed like a good idea.p  pThis has already been achieved by others so I could just follow their examples but I also like to work things out from basic principles.  One thing that I observed about other peoples solutions was that they tended to execute svn info with no regard to context.  Not a problem in and of itself but I thought it might be nice to test for the presence of the ubiquitous .svn directory before invoking svn info.p  pI arrived at this partial solutionp  precodeif [ d ..svn ]  then svn info  sed n e URL s.svnp  fi codepre  pIn the presence of a .svn directory I invoke svn info then use sed to spit out the portion of the URL in which I am interested.p  pThe problem comes however from the fact that, since svn 1.7, .svn is not ubiquitousp  pI had thought that I might replace the test for the directory with a call to find to perform a reverse directory search to search up the directory tree ... except there doesnt appear to be such an ability.p  pOther than dropping the test for .svn entirely, can anybody suggest how I might test for the presence of said folder in the current location and all parent foldersp  pMany thanks.p

Negative 2149 pI have a setup where theres a little embedded board that has TCPIP running a web server. My clients asked me to implement firmware upgrade from a web browser. In principle, this doesnt seem too onerous I already have a file going between the browser and the embedded server. However, one thing concerns me and that is the order in which the computer running the browser sends out the chunks of the file to the embedded server. p  pI dont have enough RAM on the embedded board to put the whole of a new image in volatile memory. I need to program a portion of the file as each TCP packet comes in. Now that, I guess, shouldnt be too much of an issue except for something which is nagging away in the back of my mind when I learnt network back in the mists of time at university. That is, I believe that there is no guarantee that packets of data will be received in the correct order and its up to the receiving device to ensure the packets are put together in the requisite correct order. p  pAs all this is taking place on a very simple LAN with only one subnet, no gateways or anything like that, am I worrying about nothing Will the fact that it is possibly like a pointtopoint connection albeit through a switch that I am worrying for no reason and the browser will only send packet x1, when packet x has been successfully received p  pMany thanksp

Negative 2149 pThis is happening when I use a more recent version of wsimport. The example WSDL below contains a SimpleType SomeEnum that becomes an enum in the JAXB class. I have some code that generates the XSD schema back from the JAXB class and previously it would correctly assign the type tnsSomeEnum to this element but now treats it as string.p  pI eventually discovered that wsimport was adding the annotation  XmlSchemaTypename  string, causing this behavior.

Negative 2149 pI started a new job and we use Windows servers for PHP local, dev, stage, live, but the new project was committed with Git for Windows with the default setting use Unixstyle line endings for commits paraphrasing selected by the team members, and now any file I open with Notepad shows files with no newlines.p  pI can use other file editors to read the files though its more steps for quick views, but Im worried that the Unixstyle line endings will cause issues with Windows servers. I havent seen a problem yet with the new or old code the latter of which had mixed files, and committing with CRLF shows up in the git diff, so it could look bad unless all files are converted at the same time with an obvious message.p  pIs it going to be worth converting to CRLF I doubt the system will move to Unix theyre entrenched pretty heavily and use IBM System i infrastructure as their data backbone, but Im not sure Unixstyle line endings will cause a problem.p

The problem is, the exact number of lines to include varies from file to file. So what I need to do is to output the entire block of lines between code  A trackcode and a line beginning with codecode OR  code code OR codeEOFcode. I also need to filter the block to extract the first codeTrack numbercode and the codeCodec IDcode. I tried using code grep Eo [09]  head 1code to extract the first number of each track but it only works on the first track found and quits.

I fill the codevectorcode with points using codeFillVectorcode and codevec.pushback...code and passing codeveccode by reference. The codevectorcode always gets the same size after the codeFillVectorcode function e.g 10 points. The question is Do I have to clear the codevectorcode before going again in the codeIdlecode in order to reuse it with the same size but different points each time  Or the fact that I declare again codeveccode with the same name means that it is reinitialized with zero objects p

Negative 2149 pIve been working with Ember for several months now. Our project had to run offline so we used App Cache and Ember Localstorage Adapter. Ive become very comfortable with this approach. We load all data at once from the server and then use it throughout the projects Routes. p  pCurrently we must build the Admin Panel for our project. It is not required to work offline. I thought I might give Embers RESTAdapter a try since it seems to be the most popular way of working with data.p  pAt first impression it seems to me that it makes things more complicated. p  pFor example and Ill oversimplify things for the sake of the example, I have 2 entities p  precodeApp.User  DS.Model.extend     firstName DS.attrstring,     lastName DS.attrstring,     phoneNumber DS.attrstring,     studies DS.hasManystudy   App.Study  DS.Model.extend     name DS.attrstring,     description DS.attrstring,  codepre  pAnd the rotuesp  precodeApp.UsersRoute  Ember.Route.extend     model function         return this.store.finduser        App.UserRoute  Ember.Route.extend     setupController function controller, model          var userId  model.getid         this.super.applythis, arguments         this.store.finduser, userId.thenfunction user              controller.setuser, user                codepre  pOn the codeuserscode route I show only the users basic info.  On the codeusercode route I show his info and the studies to which he is assigned to. p  pThis means the if the user moves from codeuserscode to codeusercode route using a codetransitionTocode, the codeusercode template will receive the codeusercode model from the in memory data store. Still, there are no codestudiescode loaded yet and wont be able to show them. Eventually, we must sideload the codestudiescode models once with the codeuserscode.p  pIf the codeusercode route is accessed directly from the browsers URL or a page refresh occurs then the server must provide the codeusercode model with the codestudiescode sideloaded once again.p  pSo on the server side we must implement two controller methods which must return something like this.p  pcodeuserscode routep  precode    users[user1,user2],     studies[study1, study2, study3]    codepre  pcodeusercode route  p  precode    useruserdata,     studies[and array of studies]  codepre  pConsidering that we dont use big sets of data. Supposingly up to 20 users and up to 20 studies, why shouldnt I load them at once and store them using the localstorage adapter in order to keep the data safe from page refresh and use RESTAdapter p  pIt seems to me that strongby using RESTAdapter,strong we must strongwrite much more code on the server sidestrong and most importantly the user experience will be affected.

Negative 2149 pAfter hunting for a related or duplicate question concerning the following to no avail I can only do marginal justice to describe the sheer number of pointerarithmetic and postdecrement questions tagged with C, but suffice it to say boatloads does a grave injustice to that result set count I toss this in the ring in hopes of clarification or a referral to a duplicate that eluded me. p  pIf the postdecrement operator is applied to a pointer such as below, a simple reverseiteration of an array sequence, does the following code invoke undefined behavior p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstring.hgt  int main      char s[]  some string     const char t  s  strlens      whiletgts         fputct, stdout     fputcn, stdout      return 0  codepre  pIt was recently proposed to me that 6.5.6.p8 Additive operators, in conjunction with 6.5.2.p4, Postfix increment and decrement operators, specifies even emperformingem a postdecrement upon codetcode when it already contains the baseaddress of codescode invokes undefined behavior, regardless of whether the resulting value of codetcode not the codetcode expression result is evaluated or not. I simply want to know if that is indeed the case.p  pThe cited portions of the standard werep  blockquote   pstrong6.5.6 Additive Operatorsstrongp      ol start8   liIf both the pointer operand and the result point to elements of the   same array object, or one past the last element of the array object,   the evaluation shall not produce an overflow otherwise, the behavior   is undefined.li   ol blockquote  pand its nearly tightly coupled relationship with...p  blockquote   pstrong6.5.2.4 Postfix increment and decrement operators Constraintsstrongp      ol   liThe operand of the postfix increment or decrement operator shall have   atomic, qualified, or unqualified real or pointer type, and shall be a   modifiable lvalue. li   ol      pSemantics p      ol start2   lipThe result of the postfix  operator is the value of the operand. As a side effect, the value of the operand object is incremented that is, the value 1 of the appropriate type is added to it. See the discussions of additive operators and compound assignment for information on constraints, types, and conversions and the effects of operations on pointers. The value computation of the result is sequenced before the side effect of updating the stored value of the operand. With respect to an indeterminatelysequenced function call, the operation of postfix  is a single evaluation. Postfix  on an object with atomic type is a readmodifywrite operation with memoryorderseqcst memory order semantics.98 pli   lipThe strongpostfix  operatorstrong is analogous to the postfix  operator, except that the value of the operand is decremented that is, the value 1 of the appropriate type is subtracted from it.pli   ol      pForward references strongadditive operators 6.5.6strong, compound assignment 6.5.16.2.p blockquote  pThe very reason for using the postdecrement operator in the posted sample is to avoid emevaluatingem an eventuallyinvalid address value against the base address of the array. For example, the code above was a refactor of the followingp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstring.hgt  int main       char s[]  some string      sizet len  strlens         char t  s  len  1     whilet gt s               fputct, stdout         t  t  1          fputcn, stdout  codepre  pForgetting for a moment this has a nonzerolength string for codescode, this general algorithm clearly has issues perhaps not as clearly to some. If codes[]code were instead codecode, then codetcode would be assigned a value of codes1code, which itself is not in the valid range of codescode through its onepastaddress, and the evaluation for comparison against codescode that ensues is no good. If codescode has nonzero length, that addresses the eminitialem codes1code problem, but only temporarily, as eventually this is emstillem counting on that value whatever it is being valid for comparison against codescode to terminate the loop. It could be worse. it could have naively been p  precode    sizet len  strlens  1     char t  s  len codepre  pThis has disaster written all over it if codescode were a zerolength string.  The refactored code of this question opened with was intended to address all of these issues. But...p  pMy paranoia may be getting to me, but it isnt paranoia if theyre really all out to get you. So, per the standard these sections, or perhaps others, does the original code scroll to the top of this novel if you forgot what it looks like by now indeed invoke undefined behavior or notp
Negative 2149 pIm trying to generate a adjacency matrix from a csv.p  pThe csv contains 2 columns, 1 for users and 1 for projects. The two columns form a bipartite graph, where each user can be part of multiple projects or none at all, but no edges between nodes of the same set there are no repeating entries for the same userproject pair, but there are repeated entries of the same user or projects with different combinations for pairs.p  pI wrote a comparison for comparing each users project with the entire project set using Matlab and ismembera,b. The algorithm runs iteratively through each entry. In the end, I have an adjacency matrix of size Musers  user x users  user.p  pFor small entry count lt 15000, it works fast, but for a sample of 15000, Matlab stalls. I initialize the adjacency matrix with a zeros matrix zeror,c and add row by row the results of ismembera,b. But for my Matlab, a zeros matrix zero15000,15000 almost maxes out the memory.

For that, I basically need to convert the SPDF to a regular matrix, where colnumber and rownumber indicate the position of each point in order.p  pIve tried usingp  precode    as.matrixrasterFromXYZdata.framexgridlon,ygridlat,zgridscore,crsWGS84 codepre  pBut this gives me problems when using negative values.

As I said suggestions for improvement are welcome. My real problem is the visualization. In html all the divs are squares and and rotating and translating theses Squarestriangles gives me headaches. Correct rotations works and I think am on on the right path using the sine and cosine function to determine the translation in the x and y axis. But somehow I am stuck. I am not asking anyone to solve it for me but maybe someone can show me a different approach or point out where I was wrong.p

Negative 2149 pI have a data file with blocks of xy values. Each block contains 16 lines with xy pairs and each block represents those positions in a different time. a hrefhttppastebin.com0teRrfRU relnofollowhttppastebin.com0teRrfRUap  pI want to plot the trajectory of a specific particle. To do that, Ive written codeplot pos.dat u 23 every n0nicode, where codencode is the nth particle and codeicode is the time up to which I want the trajectory plotted I can then loop over the i to generate an animation.p  pThis runs fine, but when I add codew linescode nothing gets plotted, and I dont understand why. Is there a way to plot this with lines The only alternative I see is writing a script to parse the data file and generate a new one with only the values I want effectively acting as codeeverycode, but I dont want to do that if I can do it in Gnuplot.p

Negative 2149 pTo demonstrate the problem I created a simple application that consists of 4 blank forms. One of them Form1 is the main and shows automatically. Showing other forms I put in the code projectp  precode begin   Application.Initialize   Application.CreateFormTForm1, Form1   Application.CreateFormTForm2, Form2   Application.CreateFormTForm3, Form3   Application.CreateFormTForm4, Form4   Form2.Show   Form3.Show   Form4.Show   Application.Run end. codepre  pOn the second form or any other Form2 I put a button that, when clicked, synchronously executes long 5 seconds SQL query any, I open the stored procedure. Is it synchronous, that is, the app hangs for at least 10 seconds. At this time triggers the windows ghosting. Windows creates Windows Ghost for all Windows stale apps that you can minimize, move and close. After executing a query, the application resumes processing messages and everything returns to its original state.p  pIt must be so, but for me it is not. In fact, after defrosting program Zorder of the Windows is changed, the order of the Windows mixed. Moreover, the top or bottom can get out of any window, I have not noticed any pattern. It seems that Windows does not correctly restore the Zorder when cancelling the ghosting.p  pThis behavior is also found in Delphi 2007. Note that under the Delphi debugger mode ghosting is disabled and you will not see this behavior. Run the application without debugger to see this behaviour. After disabling mode ghosting with DisableProcessWindowsGhosting  everything works correctly. p  pBut I dont want to completely disable this mode, the program often hangs for more than 5 seconds, and this mode is useful the user is still nicer to look at Windows that somehow redrawn than not redrawn at all. To rewrite half the program code for asynchronous execution of queries is very long and timeconsuming task, Im afraid we dont have enough resources, although it is undoubtedly the right approach.p  pMainFormOnTaskBar property has nothing to do with my question, there is no such property in delphi 7.p  pDoes this effect anyone else besides me If not  where did I go wrong How to force Windows to properly reconstruct the sequence of Windows p
Negative 2149 pI am into a very wired problem. I have http website built in Wordpress. The problem is when I check the view source of the site I see that it is adding https to all the css or js external files and due to that I am getting css and js missing files error.

Negative 2149 pI am writing an application to pull and process data from a content server. There are many groups of user accounts on the server, but for each group there is an admin account which has access to all user accounts of that group. The server uses OAuth2 to authenticate users.p  pThe workflow I hope to achieve is to have the user login using the admin credentials in my application, which will then use the content servers REST API to get and display a list of all the user accounts this admin has access to. The user then selects one or more user accounts, and all the files for the selected accounts will be processed.p  pI have come up with two options, but I feel there are drawbacks to bothp  ol liMy original plan was to have one class that would interact with the website to pull the data, and then pass that data to a second class for processing. Concerns with this way are unknown amount of data to pass back and forth between the classes.li liHaving the first class pull the list of users and then instead of passing a list of all the data to be processed, passing the OAuth2 token that is used for authentication, and a list of indexes of the user accounts to process. This class would then make another request to the website to pull the files to be processed. I am not sure if this is a safe practice, and it also strays from keeping the purpose of the classes separate from one anotherone to strictly pull data, one to strictly process.li ol  pWhich of these designs would be the best practice Or is there a better option I overlookedp  pstrongEDITstrong It seems that the class I was hoping to use stricly for processing will need to use the content servers REST api to retrieve additional information, so passing the OAuth2 token is looking like the only way to go about this without having to pass unknown amounts of data back and forth between the classes multiple times.p

Negative 2149 pI am trying to add a feature that lets data not be saved if an application setting is set to not save. I have many DataManagers that act as a data access layer in my application. My plan was to create 2 custom attributes code[DataRetentionPolicyNameHere]code and code[InspectDataRetention]code that should be applied to methods on my data managers and, when present, the application should check if the RetentionSetting property on my code[DataRetention]code is set to DoNotSave, and if so, ignore. For examplep  precodepublic class User        public string Name get set       [DataRetentionPII]      public long SSN get set   public class UserManager        public User GetUserint userId       [InspectDataRetention]      public void UpdateUserUser user       public void DeleteUser user   codepre  pIn the above example, when UpdateUser is called on the UserManager, the application would first inspect the object and search for any [DataRetention] attributes. It would then grab the RetentionSetting property of the attribute because the constructor for the attribute would set the retention setting and if it is set to DoNotSave, then it would reset that field to its default value in this case 0. However, if the User class were modified like belowp  precode[DataRetentionPII] public class User                 public string Name get set      public long SSN get set       codepre  pThen, when DoNotSave is configured, UpdateUser should simply return null not perform the update method.p  pIs this possible with a custom attribute If not, outside of an interceptor with a specific interface i.e. RetainableDataManager  IDataManager and have all of my data managers implement the same IDataManager interface is there any way to accomplish this behavior.p  ul liMVC4 applicationli liData Managers are POCOsli liService layer in front of Data Layer made of POCOs alsoli ul

Negative 2149 pScenario p  pLets say I have a website  www.example.com. I would like to white label it for different customers. So going to example.customer1.com should display www.example.com with some customizations like different logo, name, etc. I have opted to implement this via CNAME and filters and this setup currently works fine.p  pOne requirement is that the user accounts should be shared across all customer sites. So account on example.customer1.com should be valid on www.example.comp  pGiven that the login page should be https and customers are not going to provide me with their SSL certs amp private keys, I have opted to perform login via redirect from a hrefhttpexample.customer1.com relnofollowhttpexample.customer1.coma to a hrefhttpswww.example.comlogincustIdXXX relnofollowhttpswww.example.comlogincustIdXXXa.p  pUpon successful login on www.example.com I would like to redirect the user back to example.customer1.com  but the sessions on both these are different so I lose the session information and the user isnt logged in when after the redirect.p  pQuestion p  pTo solve this, I am thinking of passing the user id or some token that can identify the user from httpsexample.comlogin request to the redirect url httpexample.customer1.compage and then have the white label site load up the user information into its session.p  pI am afraid that this is not secure since there is a transition from https to http with some identifying information and wondering what better approaches can be taken to solve this securelyp  pThanksp

Negative 2149 pI want to check if the number of cells in four modules are equal. Therefore a known constant, which is 12, is used. The modules are either working or not. If the module is working it should be considered for the equality test.p  pHere is a possible solution but I would like to avoid division and I am looking for a simpler solution if possible.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comIOL3y.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIOL3y.png altenter image description hereap  pIn this example the first two modules are valid, specified by the lower multiplexer [1 1 0 0]. The upper multiplexer holds the number of cells for each module. The ones that are not working are set to 1 [12 12 1 1]. The cells of the working modules are added up and then divided by the number of working modules 2 in this case which should result to the average cell number per module. Here 12.p  pI thought of using a 1D selector but it doesnt seem to work well with multiplexers.

Negative 2149 pIve got a bunch of projects in the same solution, which have project dependencies all correctly set between them when nedded, obviously. There is one project whose DLL has no dependencies to any other project of the same solution lets name it codeMyFirstDll.dllcode. I created Nuget packages for all DLLs successfuly.p  pNow when I go into package manager console in my test project where I want to add certain references created from the first solution, for example codeMyDependentDllcode, I type codeInstallPackage MyNamespace.MyDependentDllcode. Nuget says it gets the DLL, and I can see it in the packages folder created on my solution folder, in the packages.config file created in my solution, in the references list of the project and even editing the csproj I can see the reference with hintpath. So everythings fine for codeMyDependentdllcode.p  pstrongProblemstrong codeMyFirstDll.dllcode, which is referenced by codeMyDependentdllcode, according to the nuget output, is successfuly installed as well as it should, bc it is referenced by codeMyDependentDllcode, and the dll actually is downloaded to the packages folder and added to the packages.config. strongBUTstrong codeMyFirstDllcode is not added to the references in the solution explorer, and is completly missing from the csproj. So it doesnt exist for Visual Studio.p  pNone of the questions here helped me.p

Negative 2149 pIm probably going to confuse myself while writing this, sorry in advancep  pIs there a way I can access a location in a dynamic arrayincrement an array pointer of pointers using the codesizeofcode the object that is in the arrayp  pFor example I have an dynamic array of type base class Student populated with derived class objectsGraduate, Undergraduate.p  pDue to this I cant just step through my array in the normal fashion to display information because the actual objects Graduate and Undergraduate are different sizes than Student. Each array step will move codesizeofStudentcode when the actual objects are larger. p  pDepending on the type of student I am doingthis is for Graduatep  precodeStudent student  new Graduateundergrad, fName, lName, major, idNum, arr2, cSize,          degreeType, thesis arr[i]  student codepre  pWhere codearrcode was declared codeStudent arr  new Student[size]codep  pUsing my array I had created this in a for loopp  precodeif students[i].getGradStatus     handleGraduateampstudents[i], i     step  step  sizeofGraduate  else if students[i].getGradStatus     handleUndergraduateampstudents[i], i     step  step  sizeofUndergraduate  codepre  pI was trying to come up with a way to change the step size. I dont think this will work with a for loop but a while loop may be different. Pretty much Im trying to go something similar to a file codeseekgcode but manually on an array. p  pAnd as Ive noticed everyone likes to question the use of dynamic arrays over vectors so let me just say I cannot use vectors on this projectNo STL is allowed  . And I have to use Polymorphism, thus why I have an array pointer of type Student holding derived class objects.p
