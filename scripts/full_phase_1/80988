Positive 80988 pI have been trying to generate a sitemap for my website which is based on angular. I have tried the automatic sitemap generators but they are unable to crawl through my website since apart from the homepage the routing is handled by angular instead of server. I tried using grunt as well but its not working as expected, of all the grunt modules available we just define the site root and a source folder, it crawls through the source folder appending each html to the site root with the relative path but since the routes have been created using the routeprovider from angular, the links generated from using grunt fairly becomes unusable. So is there any way of generating site map apart from manually generating itp

Positive 80988 pIm attempting to move from font icons icomoon.io to SVG sprites. strongIs it possible to use SVG sprites without needing lt svg  markup for each icon instancestrongp  pWhat I really liked about the font icons was that I didnt have to clutter my HTML with any additional elements to get the icon to display. I usually just targeted a simple class on whatever element I wanted the icon to display and then used pseudo selectors to display the icon, e.g.p  precodelth1 classnewsgtNewslth1gt  h1.userbefore    fontfamily icons   content news  codepre  pThat made a lot of sense to me, and all of my icons were easily managed almost completely in CSS. I rarely had to touch my HTML as long as my markup contained appropriate classes.p  pIve since switched my build system to Grunt and thought Id give SVG sprites a try.

Even when I run grunt serve verbose I see NO line that could report any kind of issue, but without issuing ionic serve explicitly, I cant get serverpage on.p  pCan you suggest what could be the issue or where I should be lookingp  pits yeomans generated a hrefhttpsgithub.comdiegonettogeneratorionic relnofollowionica project.p  pionic.projectp  precode   name yo,   appid ,   watchPatterns [www]  codepre  ppackage.jsonp  precode   name TxOffice,   version 0.0.0,   private true,   dependencies ,   devDependencies      grunt 0.4.5,     glob 4.3.5,     gruntautoprefixer 2.2.0,     gruntwiredep 2.0.0,     ionic 1.3.7,     gruntconcurrent 1.0.0,     gruntcontribclean 0.6.0,     gruntcontribconcat 0.5.0,     gruntcontribconnect 0.9.0,     gruntcontribcopy 0.7.0,     gruntcontribcssmin 0.11.0,     gruntcontribhtmlmin 0.3.0,     gruntcontribjshint 0.11.0,     gruntcontribuglify 0.7.0,     gruntcontribwatch 0.6.1,     gruntnewer 1.1.0,     gruntusemin 3.0.0,     gruntngannotate 0.9.2,     gruntngconstant 1.0.0,     jshintstylish 1.0.0,     loadgrunttasks 3.1.0,     timegrunt 1.0.0,     cordova 4.2.0,     lodash 3.1.0,     mkdirp 0.5.0,     ncp 1.0.1,     orchestrator 0.3.7,     rippleemulator 0.9.24,     elementtree 0.1.6,     plist 1.1.0,     winspawn 2.0.0   ,   engines      node gt0.10.0   ,   scripts      test grunt test   ,   cordovaPlugins [     org.apache.cordova.device,     org.apache.cordova.console,     com.ionic.keyboard,     org.apache.cordova.device,     org.apache.cordova.console,     com.ionic.keyboard,     com.ionic.keyboard,     org.apache.cordova.console,     org.apache.cordova.console,     org.apache.cordova.device,     com.ionic.keyboard,     org.apache.cordova.console,     org.apache.cordova.console,     org.apache.cordova.console,     org.apache.cordova.device,     org.apache.cordova.console,     com.ionic.keyboard   ],   cordovaPlatforms [     android   ]  codepre  pgrunt serve outputp  precode grunt serve Running serve task  Running wiredepapp wiredep task  Running cleandist clean task gtgt 16 paths cleaned.

Positive 80988 h1Preambleh1  pWhen a webpage is dynamically generated by javascript based on a hashbang codecode url, google has a hard time indexing it, and cannot provide search results or automatically accept it for services like AdSense.p  pOne solution is to introduce the codeescapedfragmentcode GET variable and serve static a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comwebmastersajaxcrawlingdocsspecification relnofollowhtml snapshotsa that represent the dynamic content.p  pThis can be done manually by visiting the website in Chrome, copy the DOM from emDeveloper Console  Elementsem, save it to a codehtmlcode file, and serve these html files when the hashbang is requested in the codeescapedfragmentcode.p  h1Problemh1  pThis is doable for the main pages, but trying to manually follow all the links and save the DOM once all the scripts have executed is nearly undoable.p  pFurthermore, this process should be repeated once in a while so the snapshots dont deviate too much from the actual website.p  h1Questionh1  pI am wondering if there is a tool or chrome extension that automates this. Open a link, let the javascript generate the DOM, and save the DOM to a file named after the hashbang.p  pIdeally this would be simple enough to do from the terminal so this can be automated using codeGruntcode on deploy.p

Positive 80988 pI have one web server and one app server running on ports 7272 and 8181 respectively. The web server is scaffolded with yeomanangulargenerator0.7.1. I had configured a proxy to serve up my APIs to facilitate development earlier and it was working fine. Later we decided to enable html5mode for angular and I enabled the connectmodrewrite to serve index.html when static files are not found. Strangely the proxies are not working now. I make the call to a hrefhttplocalhost7272apiv0.1 relnofollowhttplocalhost7272apiv0.1a17 and it does not return the response for a hrefhttplocalhost8181apiv0.1 relnofollowhttplocalhost8181apiv0.1a17...

Negative 80988 pInspired by the new a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusersflairUser Flaira, but the question applies to the general case as well.  p  pLets say I want to include something like this on a site that doesnt allow me to specify external styles or use any JavaScript code. The only thing I can do is paste in an codeobjectcode, codeembedcode, or codeiframecode, and some other simple HTML. Additionally, the width of the space is only 160 pixels, rather than the 200 needed by default for the flair badge.  p  pTo fix this, I want to set styles for the codevaluableflaircode class in the iframe, namely change width to be code160pxcode instead of code200pxcode.  Then things will be fine, as long as the username doesnt overlap and even then, once I figure this out I can use the same technique to play with that as well.p  pHow can it be implementedp

Negative 80988 pI have an application that can successfully inject keyboard input using the codeSendInputcode API with the UNICODE flag set. This causes codeWMKEYUPcode and codeWMKEYDOWNcode messages to be generated with the VK code of E7 codeVKPACKETcode, which gets appropriately translated into the correct WMCHAR message. This works in all the applications I have tried except for Pidgin, which uses GDK. GDK seems to only look for codeWMKEYUPcode messages. Since the ones being generated here dont actually have any indication of the input character only the codeWMCHARcode does, the input is ignored. Is there a way I could get around this. I havent had much luck if I use SendInput without the UNICODE flag.p

Negative 80988 pI am often asked to perform sizing and capacity planning for our clients. When our clients buy our products basically J2EE web applications, they often ask what hardware they will need to run those products. Our recommendations often result in highcost hardware acquisitions.p  pSo far, the best heuristics I developed is to compare the utilization projections number of registered and concurrent users that application should attend with the data gathered at our existing installations. Something like If installation A attends 100 concurrent users with X hardware, then installation B will need 2X hardware to attend 200 concurrent users.p  pThis approach, however, has a number of problems. Clients often use different hardware and software platforms. The set of products they buy from us is generally never the same and generally parts of application are built on order for specific client. Put into account that software versions are changing etc. and there are so many parameters that can make the task of sizing very difficult.p  pI studied some books on the subject and some propose using complex mathematical models. The number of parameters these approaches require as input for example detailed classification of application features makes me think these are hardly useful. Hardware is generally ordered before even the basic requirements are defined not to mention that these will vary throughout application development and lifecycle.  So, how do you go about sizing and capacity planning Any tips and howtos appreciated.p

Negative 80988 pThe setupp  pI have two managed contexts setup on an iPhone application. A main context that I use for most queries and a background context I use for long running operations that I want to happen in the background.p  pIve setup notifications for NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification against each managed object context. In response to the notification, I call mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification to sync up. It is also a requirement that any time things change on the main context, I need to run some jobs on the background context, as the state of things has now changed.p  pThis works fine, as long as only write in the one of the contexts. In this case, writing on the main context. However, if I write on the background context, this causes an infinite loop. Saving on the background context triggers the notification to the main context, which in turn merges the changes and fires its own notification, picked up by background context. This triggers the background context to perform its background jobs, which if they write anything start the cycle again.p  pIt seems that either this is the wrong setup, or I need a way to decouple the start processing background jobs any time something changes on the main context from the change notification, or I need to make the background context readonly.p  pIdeas Unlike a typical secondcontextisforimporting scenario, I believe that I needwant my background context to remain uptodate with respect to the main context, so that I get the proper results from my background job.p

I am binding the codeDataGridcodes codeItemsSourcecode to an codeObservableCollectioncode of type codeRowViewModelcode which is inherited from Dr.WPFs codeObservableDictonarycode of type codeCellViewModelcode and I want bind to a property of a codeCellViewModelcode. p  pFor example in what follows I am trying to change the state of the codeDatagridCell.FontStylecode property based on my codeCellViewModel.IsLockedcode boolean property so that if codeIsLockedcode then Italic. p  pFirst to get expose the relevant CellViewModelobject in XAMLp  precodeltDataGrid.Resourcesgt         ltcvRowColumnToCellConverter xKeyRowColumnToCellConvertergt          ltMultiBinding xKeyCellViewModel ConverterStaticResource RowColumnToCellConvertergt             ltBinding gt             ltBinding RelativeSourcexStatic RelativeSource.Self PathColumn gt         ltMultiBindinggt  ltDataGrid.Resourcesgt codepre  pThe RowColumnToCellConverter isp  precodepublic class RowColumnToCellConverter  IMultiValueConverter     public object Convertobject[] values, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture             RowViewModelltstring,CellViewModelgt row  values[0] as RowViewModelltstring,CellViewModelgt         string column  values[1] as DataGridColumn.SortMemberPath         string col  column.Substring1, column.Length  2         return row[col]        public object[] ConvertBackobject value, Type[] targetTypes, object parameter, CultureInfo culture             throw new NotSupportedException        codepre  pThen create the codeDataTriggercode in XAMLp  precode    ltDataGrid.CellStylegt         ltStyle TargetTypexType DataGridCellgt             ltStyle.Triggersgt                 ltDataTrigger ValueTrue gt                     ltDataTrigger.Binding gt                           ltBinding PathisLocked SourceStaticResource CellViewModel gt                     ltDataTrigger.Bindinggt                     ltSetter PropertyFontStyle ValueItalicgt                 ltDataTriggergt             ltStyle.Triggersgt                      ltStylegt     ltDataGrid.CellStylegt codepre  pNow this does not work but is an example of what I would emlikeem to do, hopefully it is not far off. Certainly the codeMultiBindingcode is never set here since the codeConvertercode is never called checking in debug.  p  pElsewhere the codeMultiBindingMultiConvertercode works although I cut it down for this post hopefully did not introduce any errors that is as a part of a codeDataTriggerMultiTriggercode not as a StaticResource as in the above  which is what I would emlikeem but then it only reveals an object that is not iself bound to. p  pThat is I could have a variant of converter where the object returned is emrow[col].Islockedem however then the Islocked Property is not registered for PropertyChange notifications.  p  pNow I cannot add the codeIsLockedcode property or can I as a third bind statement for the BindingCollection in the original MultiBind, as until the MultiBind returns an object, there is nothing for the third bind statement emBind PathIsLockedem to refer to. p  pSo I tried nesting codeMultiBindingcode in something like the following which does not work since codeBindingCollectioncode only accepts Binding objects not codeMultBindingcode objects.p  precode   ltDataGrid.CellStylegt         ltStyle TargetTypexType DataGridCellgt             ltStyle.Triggersgt                 ltDataTriggergt                      ltDataTrigger.Bindinggt                         ltMultiBindinggt                             ltMultiBinding ConverterStaticResource RowColumnToCellConvertergt                                 ltBinding gt                                 ltBinding RelativeSourcexStatic RelativeSource.Self PathColumn gt                             ltMultiBindinggt                             ltBinding PathIsLockedgt                         ltMultiBindinggt                     ltDataTrigger.Bindinggt                     ltSetter PropertyFontStyle ValueItalicgt                 ltDataTriggergt             ltStyle.Triggersgt                       ltStylegt     ltDataGrid.CellStylegt codepre  pHopefully my problem should be clear from the above even if my attempted solutions are far off. So what am I missing Probably a lot since I have only been using WPFMVVM for a few weeks and this is a really basic requirement for working with any DataGrid, so I hope the answer is embarrassingly simple.p
Negative 80988 pWeve only recently begun using TFS 2008 with Visual Studio 2008. A couple of developers discovered the Get everything when a solution or project is opened option in VS and decided it was a good ideaand it would seem to be.p  pHowever, weve been getting some curious results when opening some solutions. The solutions in question contain several projects of mixed typesmostly class libraries and  web apps. The curious part is the list of files in the Get dialog box that comes up.p  pHeres what Ive found out so far about the files in the listp  ul liThe list is incomplete not every controlled file in the solution is listed.li liThe version in the workspace matches the version in source control.li liThey are not missing from the workspace.li liThere are files from each of the projects in the solution though, not every file in each project is included.li liThe list of files is the same for three seperate developers on three seperate machines.li liRunning a strongtf getstrong from a command line does not yeild the same results.li ul  pAny insight into this would be greatly appreciated. As I mentioned, this option seems like a good idea, but were a bit hesitant to rely on it when the results are unexpected.p  pThanks.p

Negative 80988 pIm currently setting up two servers, one for me and one for a client. Mine is purely a Django server with no PHP in sight. The other is a PHP server with no Django in sight. They are both VPSs with Ubuntu Server 10.04 Lucid on them.p  pBoth require some sort of mail server so the Django and PHP applications can send mail from the server. Both servers dont require email accounts as I do these with Google Apps For Domains. I merely want a solution for letting these technologies send mail, in a way that is totally standard. no funny send mail setups or anything...p  pI was told Postfix is the way to go for email servers. But everywhere I see that it should have MySQL as well. Is this the only way to have a functional Postfix server Though my clients PHP server will have MySQL anyhow as it will be hosting the PHP based Simple Machines Forum, my Django server will be using PostgreSQL throughout. And the idea of installing MySQL just for Postfix there seems over the top for me.p  pIs there other solutions out there Am I looking at this all wrong Is there maybe other solutions that would fill this needp

Negative 80988 pI have this question on and of for a year or two, but it is so nonspecific, and my native language is not English, so I dont know how to ask to be precise and everybody will understand what is my dilemma.p  pIt is even more valid if using objects but for the sake of simplicity Ill make a simple example theoretical with a function and database.p  pWe all know functions are good because I dont need on every page to think about what it does, it simply does it. Lets say we have a member table in mysql that has many fields including ID, username, age, sex, avatarlink. For this example tats enough...p  pNow I want to make a function named fWriteUser. That function would on many locations in a site write username, put a small picture of member gender sex and put a avatar image next to it and when you go with mouse over username it would say users age. Ok, stupid example, but it is ok I guess...p  pOn every page I deal with usernames of course I have a recordset with some of the parameters I need from them. For example in forum I also take username and ID out of this table and from forum tables I get topic and message of forum post...p  pNow I have 2 choices to call the functionp  ol liI allways call the function with like fWriteUseruserID. The userID I have in session variable I use ASP but the question is not ASP specific, but I could have a cookie or something else. I dont worry about calling this function, as I only feed userID and the function does the rest. On every page on the site I have same call and I get what the function is supposed to to. But this way I need in the function to take sex, avatarlink, username from the query. I HAVE to make another select from table member to take this data out. And if in forum I have 20 topics this would be called 20 times. ID is known of the member so I guess this is a fast function. If I would use objects I would call object method but in this method the query would also need to be run.li ol  pAnd sicer I take some member data on every page I in fact spend mysql time doing it in function again. For the commodity of having to call function only with ID, so I can in fact later change inside of function and add some new member info as I only change the function itself.p  ol liSecond way is I feed the function with all the required data from every page I need to call it like fWriteUseruserID, username, sex, avatarlink... That way I can take all this data on every HTML page when I take other member data so the SELECT query runs only once. The big downside is that if I want to add new member variable I have to open all pages and in the SELECT statement add another variable and change function call to add another variable or add new property if using objects.li ol  pFor a big site approach 2 is certanly a pain to implement and sustain... I would prefer to use option 1, but that would add many more select statements on every page, because member function call is just example, I may have other functions.p  pSo my question is is it wise to make 10 selects instead of one every function its own select or is it better to feed every variable from the main page and make it hard to maintain...p  pI dont know how much processor time is neeed for one SELECT from members if I take just a few variabls, I have indexes and about 100.000 members in the table. Is this select cached somehowp  pI could make like a 100 session variables for members so I can feed them when needed inside functions but I am not sure how many sessions I can have and it would work for members but not for some other data...p  pI know it is not a specific problems but more of a best practice problem, but this is preventing me to make functions self sustained and dependent on one parameter instead of 10 and I am having difficulty maintaining the site. I tried to use objects I am now to OOP but I see objects methods have the same problem  you have to SELECT in each method if you want to do different things with object. I mean, functions in objects that need something from database have same problem.p  pThank you for everybody who made it till here... I know it was a long read  But it is a year or two on my mind...p  pYoursp  pJerryp  pstrongUPDATE strong on all the answers there are, I think the point is still being missed. Let me try to make myself more clear with a practical example.p  pI have a forum. On the forum there is a list of 50 topics with titles and user data. Titles are in table topics and userdata comes from table members.p  pI have 2 choices to fetch the datap  ol lipI can make a SELECT FROM topics JOIN members etc... and get in each row a title and all the user data I need.pli lipI can take only topics data and do not take member data except member ID at this point for every loop. Where in HTML I have to show usernames their gender, avatar link etc. I can call function fWriteUservarID and the function in effect does everything, load from member table and does output with the data.pli ol  pObviously it is better to use method 1 because I call select 1 time I have all the data I need for the page in this select. But because I dont want to fetch member data again from function fWriteUser I have to pass all the member data that the function uses like call fWriteUserID, avatarlink, gender, etc..p  pI am using this approach now and it is fast of course. The second approach would not be so efficient as I would need 1 query to fetch topic data and then ntimes make SELECT in the function to get user data for topic writer 1, topic writer 2 etc. I could do cache as was suggested, but that would only help if the authors on the topic list would be the same. If I have 50 different authors each with its own topic, I would still need a recordset loop to get topic data and user ID and inside that loop I would call function 50 times which would make 50 SELECT statements for 50 topics to get the member data of the correcponding members.p  pBut this second approach is nicer to maintain pages. I just call fWriteUservarID and I dont worry. Using first approach I worry. If I add another parameter I want to have manipulating print output from a member like display age I need to open ALL the html pages I have and add age to all the queries that I use on the pages where memebrs are involved and this are of course different queries, not same, as once I join members with topics, once with recipes, once with photo albums etc.... That is hours work just because I wanted to add age. So extending the call to have one more parameter is possible automatically using arrays, but the problem is I have to modify all the join queries anyway.p  pI hope I am more clear now what bothers me, if not I reast my case p
Negative 80988 pFirst of all, I am not a veteran programmer i any language. But Ive been tinkering with python pretty substantially the last couple of months so I wouldnt consider my self completely green either.p  pSome keywords for youbr  Windowsbr  Python 2.6br  Pygame, CGKitp  pOkay, so Ive got the CGKit module, which contains a WinTab wrapper for capturing data from the Wacom tablet. WinTab requires a certain window to be active in order for it to start capturing, and for that Im using PyGame. However, PyGame is pretty brutal on the CPU and gives me between 100200 fps on drawing simple text and rectangles meters for the wacom input data. and about 200400 fps when not blitting anything.p  pNow, the tablet hardware, and the WinTab API support a transfer rate of 200hz, which is all good. The problem is that the data Im getting from WinTab isnt at 200hz 5ms per packet but is instead at the current framerate of my PyGame window, which, on top of everything, is not static.p  pSo you see the problem. In order for WinTab to acquire any data, it has to have a window assigned to it and it need to be active. But having a PyGame window open, means that the stream of data is limited to the framerate of the pygame window. p  pIm sure there are other window managers I could be using that wont take up any or little CPU, but what Id really like is for WinTab to acquire the data at constant 200hz rate without any dependencies.p  pIm thinking threading. Breaking up the gatherdata and drawing parts, but since WinTab need a window to get any data in the first place, I cant figure out how that would be possible.p  pAlso note that Ive never threaded anything before, although I do understand the concept. brbr So, hope I made the problem reasonably clear. p  pstrongThe question isstrong, how can I get the data at a minimum of 200hz, while still being able to do maybe 2030 fps on my PyGame windowp

Negative 80988 pThis is a situation Ive run into several times, not sure what the best approach is.p  pLets say I have some kind of dynamic content that users can add to via Ajax. For example, take Stack Overflows comments  people can add comments directly on to the page using Ajax.p  pThe question is, how do I implement the addition itself of the new content. For example, it looks like the ajax call which Stack Overflow uses to add a comment, simply returns html which replaces emallem of the comments not just the new one. This way saves redundant logic in the Javascript code which has to know what the html looks like. p  pIs this the best approach If so, how best to implement it in Django so that there is no redundancy i.e., so that the view doesnt have to know what the html looks likep  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrong In my specific case, there is no danger of other comments being added in the meantime  this is purely a question of the best implementation.p
Negative 80988 pIm making a bitmap editor where a document consists of several layers where each layer represents a bitmap. Each layer must have a unique ID compared to all other layers that currently exist in the document. I also need to take into account that I need to save and load documents along with the layer IDs.p  pIm using the command pattern to store actions that are performed on the document and the unique IDs are used to keep track of which layer an action should be performed on. p  pAt the moment, I just keep a counter called X, when a new layer is created its ID is set to X then X is incremented. When loading, I need to make sure X is set to an appropriate number so that new layers are given unique IDs i.e. I could save the value of X and restore that, or set X based on the biggest layer ID loaded.p  pGiven X is a 32bit number, the user will need to create 4,294,967,296 layers working on the same file before IDs start to be reused which will cause weird behaviour. Should I implement a better unique ID system or is this generally good enough p  pIm in Java so I could use the UUID library which creates 128 bit unique IDs according to a standard algorithm. This seems overkill though.p  pIs there some general approach to this kind of problemp

Negative 80988 pCan someone point me to some example code on how best to do caching while loading up the dynamic parts of a page using javascriptp  pMy canonical example involves a page where nothing ever changes other than the users logged in status and username at the top of the page.  Changing this text through jQuery and an ajax request is easy enough, but since Im doing it on codedocument.readycode, if you look quickly, you can see the page load with something like Click Here to Login before the ajax request fires and updates that section of the page.p  pstrongEdit for clarificationstrongp  pIf I cache the entire page, the following happens.p  ol liUser A requests the pageli liPage strongis not cachedstrong, so application generates html with Hi User A in the upper right cornerli liUser B requests the pageli liPage strongis cachedstrong, so application serves it us asis  including the Hi User A bit lt This is the part that I want to dynamically update.li ol  pIdeally, at step 2, the page would get cached without the Hi User A bit, so that when someone requests the page, I make a simple ajax request to get the greeting and then shove it into the dom.p  pIm assuming javascript is the way to go, but Im thinking there has to be a better way than to wait for codedocument.readycode such that the page renders more naturally.p  pIf it matters though I dont think it should, as a solution that applies to static html would also work for what Im doing, Im using rails 2.3.x and jQuery.p

Negative 80988 pIm developing an web application that uses a nonrelational database as a backend djangononrel  AppEngine. I need to store some hierarchical data projectssubproject1subprojectNtasks, and Im wondering which pattern should I use. For now I thought ofp  ul liAdjacency List store the items parent id li liNested sets store left and right values for the itemli ul  pIn my case, the depth of nesting for a normal user will not exceed 45 levels. Also, on the UI, I would like to have a pagination for the items on the first level, to avoid to load too many items at the first page load.p  pFrom what I understand so far, nested sets are great when the hierarchy is used more for displaying. Adjacency lists are great when editing on the tree is done often. In my case I guess I need the displaying more than the editing when using nested sets, even if the display would work great, the above pagination could complicate things on editing.p  pDo you have any thoughts and advice, based on your experience with the nonrelational databasesp
Negative 80988 pI have a database structure that has two onetomany relationships. I have a website, which has many subjects, each of which has many questions. This results in three database tables, one for each of these types of data.p  pWhat I am in the process of doing is implementing a staging area  somewhere where I can make changes to these websites without affecting the live site. So, Ive duplicated the table structure with the intent of editing the duplicates, and pushing changes to the live version when the changes are ready. I would like to do this push in one stored procedure, but I cant figure out how to maintain the relationship between the subjects and their questions.p  pThe website has identifying features other than its ID, so its easy enough to find the live version of the site, and update its information, and even to transfer that websites subjects from the staging tables to the live tables.p  pHere is some pseudocode for what my plan is for the pushp  precode pass in the ID of the staging website  get the ID of the live website  update live website data from staging website data      this is a strict update  if there is a staging version, there will necessarily be a live version  delete all live subjects  delete all live questions  copy subjects from staging to live  copy questions from staging to live codepre  pNote that subjects and questions may be added or removed, in addition to being edited thus, deleting and reinserting seems the best course of action.p  pIve been able to write actual code for most of this, as its relatively simple. But figuring out how to maintain the relationship between the subjects and the questions has been a problem. If I were doing this in a serverside scripting language, I would do something like this again, pseudocodep  precodefor each subject     copy information from staging subject to live subject     get id of new live subject     for each question in this subject         copy information from staging to live, setting subject ID to new live ID codepre  pAs I said, Id like to keep this all in the same stored procedure. If this is not possible, then Ill obviously go for the above version, but for efficiencys sake, Id rather not have several database hits.p

Negative 80988 pIm experimenting my distributed clustering algorithm implemented with MPI on 24 computers that I set up as a cluster using BCCD Bootable Cluster CD that can be downloaded at a hrefhttpbccd.net relnofollowhttpbccd.neta.p  pIve written a batch program to run my experiment that consists in running my algorithm several times varying the number of nodes and the size of the input data.p  pI want to know the amount of data used in the MPI communications for each run of my algorithm so I can see how the amount of data changes when varying the previous mentioned parameters. And I want to do all this automatically using a batch program.p  pSomeone told me to use tcpdump, but I found some difficulties in this approach.p  pFirst, I dont know how to call tcpdump in my batch program which is written in C using the command system for making calls before each run of my algorithm, since tcpdump requires another terminal to run in parallel with my application. And I cant run tcpdump in another computer since the network uses a switch. So I need to run it on the master node.p  pSecond, I saw the traffic with tcpdump while my experiment was going on and I couldnt figure out what was the port used by MPI. It seems to use many ports. I wanted to know that for filtering the packages.p  pThird, I tried capturing whole packages and saving it to a file using tcpdump and in a few seconds the file was 3,5MB. But my whole experiment takes 2 days. So the final log file will be huge if I follow this approach.p  pThe ideal approach would be to capture just the size field in the header of the packages and sum this up to obtain the total amount of data transmitted. In that way the logfile would be much smaller than if I were capturing the whole package. But I dont know how to do it.p  pAnother restriction is that I dont have access to the computer disc. So I only have the RAM and my 4GB USB Flash drive. So I cant have huge logfiles.p  pI have already thought about using some MPI tracing or profiling tool such as those mentioned at a hrefhttpwww.openmpi.orgfaqcategoryperftools relnofollowhttpwww.openmpi.orgfaqcategoryperftoolsa. I have only tested Sun Performance Analyzer until now. The problem is that I guess it will be difficult to install those tools on BCCD and maybe even impossible. In addtion to that, this tool will make my experiment take longer to end, sice it adds overhead. But if someone is familiar with BCCD and think it is a good choice to use one of those tools, so please let me know.p  pHope someone have a solution.p
Negative 80988 pI have a table in HTML with a few rows.p  pI originally gave some of those table rows TR an ID and I would use javascript to set the INNERHTML of some of these table rows with some new dynamic content.p  pHowever, Internet Explorer doesnt like this and gives an unknown runtime error because I am trying to set the INNERHTML of an inline element.p  pSo now, Im attempting to instead replace the entire table row child with a new one. I cant simply appendChild because I need the new table row to be in the same position as the original to imitate as if just this table rows content had been changed when in reality, the entire row is being replaced.p  pWas hoping someone had a solution to this I was thinking a get child position b delete original table row and c insert new table row at child position found in A. Perhaps there is even an easier and better solution Would love some input.p  pCheersp

Negative 80988 pWhile thinking of loadsave mechanics for a game using Lua coroutines a quite interesting question has arisen  can you dump a running Lua state to file completely Apart from the obvious solutions of dumping the environment two notable problems have arisen  dumping functions which I think is easier, and dumping coroutines.p  pThe latter made me wonder, whether it is possible at all to dump a running coroutine for a later resume call. The uses for that would be quite wide  in the long run it would allow serialization of running tasks and passing them around Erlang style.p  pHence the question  is it possiblep  pIm not searching for the maybe obvious no answer, for it probably is possible at some degree of work required ergo in the worst case one could try to hack the compiler.

Works fine. Next, I have a file called codeinfo.htmlcode that contains the flesh of a codeUIWebViewcode that I use as an About box. Ive put it in the language folders codeen.lprojcode and codede.lprojcode, and added them to my Resources in Xcode.  Now, in Simulator, both the Strings, and the html file display in the appropriate language. However, on the device, the Strings appear localized while the html file remains untranslated.p  pThis is a strange inconsistency between Simulator and Device Anybody know of a workaround ...other than defying the localization system, and using codeNSLocalizedStringcode to call codedeinfo.htmlcode, codeeninfo.htmlcode etc. by hand.p

NTiers, or anything else.  Im not really looking for the identifying features that make MVVM different. Im looking for the things that can not be done in anything else but MVVM.  My current knowledge on it leads me to think, that MVVM is different way to do the same thing that introduces more complexity then say nTiers. I dont want to take the angle that the introduction of this complexity , is a negative thing. If it is justified by the enabling of unique benefits then I would like to know this. p  pAn in depth google, has only turned up MVVM defenitions. It has not turned up these unique benefits. p

Negative 80988 pIm working on a winforms application meant for touchpads and would like the user to be able to scroll through the contents by swiping their finger across the screen. I see that windows at least windows 7 has this behavior built in for any scrollable control. However the control Im trying to scroll is a third party control that went ahead and made its own scrollbar elements, so this built in behavior is lost.p  pI could get the same behavior by placing that third party control in a panel, and letting that panel handle the scrolling. However when the user swipes on that control, its containing panel doesnt hear those events and scrolling never takes place.p  pAre they any resources on how windows handles touchpad scrolling, or how I could make a panel respond to touchpad swipes when the cursor is inside one of its child controlsp
Negative 80988 pI have some code that demonstrates the use of threads by the use of the Runnable interface. I started with code off a website somewhere, and modified it to my liking.

Negative 80988 pSo my current project is mostly in Python, but Im looking to rewrite the most computationally expensive portions in C to try and boost performance.  Much of this I can achieve via simple functions loaded from DLL files, but not everything.  I have a multidimensional array in Python that I want to perform operations on in C particularly A pathfinding, but Im not really sure how to translate them, and constantly sending data one piece at a time into a loaded function seems really inefficient the arrays first two dimensions are in the low hundreds, and the functions will need to deal with scores, if not hundreds, of elements in the array at a time.p  pMy idea was to have a class in C that creates its own copy of the array at setup where performance isnt as much of an issue and has methods that are performed on the array and return data to the main Python  program.  However, Im not sure how to accomplish this, and even if this is the proper way to go about such a thing that would seem to imply having C code running parallel to the main Python program, and intuition tells me thats a bad idea.  p  pI dont know much about integrating C and Python beyond how to load simple functions via cTypes in Python, so Id really appreciate some pointers here.  Keep in mind Im relatively new to C at all most of my programming experience is in Python.  What would be the best way to fit the two together in this situationp

Negative 80988 pI have recently install the C in order to relearn the language have done some small project on it. One thing that really annoys me is that the autocomplete function when implementation doesnt work anymore.    p  pMore specifically the autocompleting of the parameters and function name. I have already declared my class and functions in respective headers. Though my memory is a bit hazy, I remember back in 2008, once you enter the name in the cpp file, it will automatically give you a dropdown box for the respective parameters.    p  pThen I have searched for forums and pages for possible solution and was informed that the intellisense feature was removed from the C environment in the new VS 2010 why. But one can retrieve the parameter list bybr 1 checking the Tool  Text Editor  C  Autolist Members and also in the advanced tab to see if the feature has been disabled.br 2 to use CtrlSpace while completing the statement.    p  pI have tried both of these and they dont work and I have read some the forums that the ctrlspace should at least work in some degree. Declaration should be correct because when I am defining the function and rightclick and name to Go to Declaration it will highlight the declaration in the header file where the whole parameter list is provided. And the CtrlJ would show me that indeed VS recognize the function declaration.p  pI would like to not use the 3rd party software such as visual assist X, but I am running out of options.p  pThank you so much in advance.p

Negative 80988 precode  GH              Release Branch    ABEF     master                  CD      bug fix branch codepre  pBased on our particular needs for our project, it is quite common for the above scenario to occur.  We have our masterdev branch with some commits.  Then we get a bug report and start fixing that on the bug branch commits C and D above.  More commits happen in the dev branch in the meantime.  Next we are told we need to create a release for a customer which cannot include the changes introduced by commits B, E and F above, but it should include the bug fix.p  pSo we branch off of dev before change B was ever applied, but what is the best way to get the bug fix into this release branch too  If I perform a merge of the branch it will include the change that was made in B which I dont want.  I could perform a cherrypick of commits C and D but I read that cherry picking is not always a good idea a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions880957pullallcommitsfromabranchpushspecifiedcommitstoanother881014881014based on this answera basically because my repo would then look likep  precode  GHCD  Release Branch    ABEF      master                  CD        bug fix branch codepre  pSo C and D appear as completely new commits with different sha1 IDs as C and D.  Is this really a bad thing  What problems can this lead to  Is there a better way of getting the changes from the bug fix branch into the release branchp

Negative 80988 pLet me get this out of the way Im used to to codeUIKitcode, where you can pushpop view controllers to your hearts content.  That just doesnt work on the Mac.  p  pWith a hrefhttpsgithub.comtwittertwui relnofollowcodeTwUIcodea, this works extremely well on the Mac. For example, look at codejoshabercodes a hrefhttpsgithub.comjoshaberTwUIPushPopTest relnofollowpushpop example using TwUIa.  If codeTwUIcode was completely stable and capable of embedding codeAppKitcode controls inside a codeTUIViewcode, I would ditch AppKit completely.  However, not everything can be done in codeTwUIcode, and I need to retain AppKit for some things.p  pThus brings my question.  How can something like this be accomplished using AppKit  Is there a library that has made this easy  Or do we need to make it ourselves  Just using codereplaceSubviewwithSubviewcode isnt enough, and isnt really pushingpopping views.    p

Negative 80988 pIf I have a mesh such as a cube with 6 faces, each consisting individually of 4 vertices, totaling 24 vertices and I want to apply a different texture to each face, how would I do this Currently I draw the entire mesh all 6 faces of a cube at once using glDrawElements, supplying all of the indices into one buffer. I cannot see a way to apply a texture to a subset of the indices when drawing. Would I have to split up the indices, drawing each face onebyone, rebinding textures between each face, or is there a more eloquent solutionp

Negative 80988 pNeed a much Optimized code.Well I Got a Project and I have Succefully made it work with the vba Mostly helped by the stackoverflow programmers Thanks for that But Today I got a Feedback. Its deleting 2 more unique entries in the record But I dont know why its deleting Them.p  pThe Algorithm I have appliedp  pI have Used the COUNTIF function Which I found on googlep  precode    countifA1A2,A30 A3 is the active cell, Checks A2,A1 for dupes codepre  pIt Throws False if there is a duplicate in The A column and True If it is a unique.What I have understood about Countif is that  It checks all the above columns values from that cell I mean let us take A4. SO it checks A2,A1,A3 for the duplicate. Similarly A10 checks for A1 to A9 and throws either TRue or False.Well It was working But I dont know what went wrong The code is not working for some entries.Its even showing False for the Unique entries sometimes.p  pAnd its taking more time to applye these formula as I have more amount of data. Im trying to make it cleaner and more Optimizing Way.People told me its not a c or some other Language to make it optimize but Im need of code that makes my code more optimizedp  pI need code for these condtions can anyone help me as my countif failed.Im little helpless in doing so.p  p1I have a column and I should check for duplicates in that column and delete that row if it is a duplicatep  p2 I have 35000 Old entries in the column and I have new entries 2000 everyweek these are appended.

Negative 80988 pbr This is my first post here, therefore apologize for any blunders.br Im developing a simple action game with the usage of OpenGL ES 2.0 and Android 2.3. My game framework on which Im currently working on is based on two dimensional sprites which exists in three dimensional world. Of course my world entities possess information such as position within the imaginary world, rotational value in form of float[] matrix, OpenGL texture handle as well as Androids Bitmap handle Im not sure if the latter is necessary as Im doing the rasterisation with the usage of OpenGl machine, but for the time being it is just there, for my convenience. This is briefly the background, now to the problematic issue.br Presently Im stuck with the pixel based collision detection as Im not sure which object here OGL texture, or Android Bitmap I need to sample. I mean, Ive already tried to sample Androids Bitmap, but it completely didnt worked for me  many runtime crashes in relation to reading outside of the bitmap. Of course to be able to read the pixels from the bitmap, Ive used iBitmap.createi method to obtain properly rotated sprite. Heres the code snippetbrp  precodeandroid.graphics.Matrix m  new android.graphics.Matrix ifo1.angle  0.0f                m.setRotateo1.angle     b1  Bitmap.createBitmapb1, 0, 0, b1.getWidth, b1.getHeight, m, false  codepre  pAnother issue, which might add to the problem, or even be the main problem, is that my rectangle of intersection rectangle indicating two dimensional space mutual for both objects is build up from parts of two bounding boxes which were computed with the usage of OpenGL matrices iMatrix.multiplyMVi functionality code below.

Negative 80988 pI have difficult in understanding the svnignore property. It would be nice if someone could help me on this.p  pI checked out a grails web app from a svn repository that has svnignore property applied for .log files and target folder. Obviously, when I checked out the .log files and target folder was missing. After working on this grails app on my local working copy, the target directory and .log files gets created. Now, when I commit the changes into the svn repo, will the target files and .log files get committed too or will they be automatically ignored because of the svnignore property already existing on the svn copy of the grails appp  pHope I have made myself clear. p  pThanks for any help offered.p

Negative 80988 pI am working on a project where I need to send variables to a PHP script as a post. p  pThe C calls a few methods to set string variables which I then need to post to a PHP script so that the PHP script can use the data from the variables.p  pHow can I go about doing this, I have tried google but they all look a bit complex and also how to get the data back from PHP which is difficult to work out where the post start and finishes in the example.p  pAll I need to know is how to post the data to the script and not for the C to then read what the PHP script has done.p  pThanks for any help you can provide.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I dont think I have explained myself very well for what I want to achieve.p  pWhat the purpose of this is to send data which will be in a string format to a PHP page via a post.

Negative 80988 pI have this new challenge to load 100M rows from an Oracle database and insert them in a remote MySQL database server.p  pIve divided the problem in twop  ol lia server side REST server responsible for loading data into the MySQL serverli lia client side Java app that is responsible from loading the Oracle data source.li ol  pAt the Java side Ive used plain JDBC for loading paginated content and transfer it over the wire to the server. This approach works well but it makes the code cumbersome and not very scalable as Im doing pagination myself using Oracles ROWNUM.....WHERE ROWNUM  x and ROWNUM lt y.p  pIve now tried Hibernates StatelessSession with my entities mapped through Annotations. The code is much more readable and clean but the performance is worse.p  pIve heard of ETL tools and SpringBatch but I dont know them very well.  Are there other approaches to this problemp  pThanks in advance.p  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pThank you for the invaluable suggestions.  Ive opted for using emSpringBatchem to load data from the Oracle database because the environment is pretty tight and I dont have access to Oracles toolset. SpringBatch is trie and true. For the data writing step I opted for writing chunks of records using MySQLs LOAD DATA INFILE as you all stated. REST services are in the middle as they are hidden from each other for security reasons.p

Negative 80988 pstrongActual Designstrongp  pFor those returning to this question, the helpful answer below pushed me towards a workable design that is running fine. Three insights were keyp  ol liEventlet is a very safe environment  if two greenlets both try coderecvcode to or both try codesendcode from the same socket simultaneously, then Eventlet elegantly kills the second greenlet with an exception. This is magnificent and means that simple exceptions, and not impossibletoreproduce data interleaving errors, will result if codeamqplibcode greens poorly.li liThe codeamqplibcode methods fall roughly into two groups codewaitcode loops inside of coderecvcode until an AMQP message is assembled, while other methods codesendcode messages back and will not attempt their own coderecvcode. This is stunningly good luck, given that the codeamqplibcode authors had no idea that someone would try to green their library It means that message sending is not only safe from the callback invoked by codewaitcode, but that messages can also be sent safely from other greenlets that are completely outside the control of the codewaitcode loop.

But to conserve TCP connections I would prefer to create just one AMQP connection, allow RabbitMQ to stream messages down the pipe at me at full speed, hand those tasks off to workers, and send answers back when each worker completesp  precode                                                                         worker  lt                                                                                                                       worker  lt                                                                                                                      worker  lt                                                                         v v v                                                        RabbitMQ ltAMQPgt socket dispatcher                              codepre  pObserve thatp  ul liAn a hrefhttpeventlet.netdocmodulesqueue.htmlEventlet queuea could elegantly distribute incoming work among the workers as they become available for more work.li liFlow control from RabbitMQ might even be possible I can ACK messages only until my workers are all busy, and then wait before sending further ACKs until the queue starts to empty.li liWork will be almost certainly completed outoforder one request might finish quickly while another event that arrived earlier takes much longer and some requests might never complete at all so the workers will be handing back responses in an unpredictable and asynchronous order.li ul  pI had been planning to write this using Eventlet and a hrefhttpeventlet.netdocmodulesqueue.htmlpyamqpliba after seeing this attractive blog post about how easily that AMQP library could be pulled into the Eventlet processing modelp  pa hrefhttpblog.eventlet.net20100209multipleconcurrentconnectionswithpyamqplibandeventlethttpblog.eventlet.net20100209multipleconcurrentconnectionswithpyamqplibandeventletap  pMy problem is that, having read the documentation for both libraries, the amqplib source code, and much of the Eventlet source code, I cannot figure out how I can teach the eventlet that owns the AMQP connection  the eventlet named codeconnecttohostcode in the blog post  to emalsoem wake up when a worker completes its work and generates an answer. The codewaitcode method in amqplib can only be awoken through activity on the AMQP socket. Though it feels like I ought to be able to have the workers write their answers to a queue, and have the codeconnecttohostcode eventlet wake up emeitherem when a new incoming message arrives emorem when a worker is ready with an answer to send, I cannot find any way for an eventlet to say wake me when emeitherem of these things happens.p  pIt did occur to me that the workers could try commandeering the AMQP connection object  or even the raw socket  and writing their own messages back over TCP but it seems as though locks would be necessary to prevent the outgoing worker messages from getting interleaved with each other or with ACK messages written by the main listener eventlet, and I cannot find where locks are available in Eventlet either.p  pAll of this makes me feel almost certain that I am trying to tackle this problem somehow exactly backwards. Does a problem like this  letting a single connection be safely shared between a listenerdispatcher and many workers  simply not map to a coroutine model, and require a fullfledged async library In which case is there one you would recommend for this problem, and how would the multiplexing take place between incoming messages and outgoing worker responses I found no clean solution earlier today trying combinations like Pika  ioloop  though I have just seen another library, a hrefhttpsgithub.compaololosistormedamqpstormedamqpa, that might do better than Pika did. Or do I actually need to fall back on real live Python threads if I want clean and maintainable code that can enact this model I am open to all options.p  pThanks for any help or ideas I keep thinking that I have the whole concurrencyinPython thing pretty much down, then I learn yet again that I do not.  And I hope you liked the ASCII art above in any case.p

I assume that codeFileInputStreamcode constructor will also throw an codeIOExceptioncode, but I specified that in the method codethrowscode clause. p  pI was considering refactoring the opening of the file to a seperate function, but I figured it would be more useful and simple to do this in the constructor, and also learns me how to control errors here. Besides, any instance of this object will not have a closedopen state. All of these objects are reserved strictly for READING a file only, so they are created on a asneeded basis per file. I will provide a codeclosecode method seperately.p  pAlso, from an extensibility point of view, would it be difficult to adapt to reading a file over a network using the codeFileInputStreamcode with the current constructor Or should I use a different class and multiple constructorsp  pThanks for any and all input.p

Negative 80988 pI have an application that records audio from a microphone and processes it. I would like to be able to perform this task while I have music playing, or sound from a movie, without picking up the music or movie sound. Since the music or movie would be playing from the same computer that the microphone is recording to, I should  in theory  have access to every bit of audio data as it comes out of the computer. I think that this should allow me to automatically cancel the output noise of the computer from the input signal of the microphone, but Im not actually sure how to go about doing this I am mostly languageagnostic here, as long as I can invoke this behavior from a .Net executable via interop or IPC or what have you. Any suggestions on how to accomplish this  especially the early parts, like getting a representation of the output audio signal from the sound card, and getting a representation of the input signal from the microphone  would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 80988 pHow does merging in a previouslyrejected idea emfrom the same branchem, work in various revision control systems Which offer support for thisp  pHere is my educated guess  is this summary accuratep  pGit and centralised VCSs Presumably, you reverted the commit that you want to merge in. So you would be literally trying to merge in an ancestor of the current commit. I havent tried this but I dont imagine it would be supported too well. I guess you could do a 3way merge with the relevant ancestor the metaphorical branch point in hindsight of the commit to merge in which youd have to identify, because thered be no record of it  but would the VCS support this or would you have to do it yourselfp  pMercurial, using bookmarks or using anonymous branching in a similar way to bookmarks If you had used this approach diligently, you would have reversed course and branched from an ancestor of the old commit at the point in time when you previously rejected it. Therefore the commit, even though it was originally done on this branch, now is not on this branch because bookmarks are dynamic, not immutable, and because you reversed course, so theres no problem at all. Merge awayp  pDarcs, if there are no tags between head and the old commit While in darcs it looks to the casual glance as if you have a straight line of commits, what you actually have is a dependency graph between the first commit or the most recent tag, and head which is not at all obvious and AFAIK there is still no tool to visualise this. So if darcs thinks your old commit was independent of the current head which is presumably quite likely, because youve reverted the old commit, they are invisibly separate branches and can be merged quite happily. If darcs thinks the old commit is depended on by head, then this situation is presumably like the git case, though I dont think anyone fully understands darcs patch theory, except maybe David Roundy.p  pDarcs, if there has been a tag in the meantime I think this would be like git, because a tag bundles all the invisible heads together and makes a single head that depends on all of them this is possibly one of the easiesttounderstand aspects of darcs patch theoryp  pFootnote For brevity Ive referred to the old commit throughout, although the previously rejected idea could of course have been a long line of commits.p

In addition to being able to test that everything compiles fine in a single step, Im wondering if this actually allows me to use parts of the C standard that VC does not yet support  such as variadic templates and a few other features.p  pWould this be possible Logic seems to dictate that this is so, but I would guess it depends on if gcc needs some windowsspecific tool that generates these things as part of the cross compilation stage.p

Negative 80988 pWe are working on a desktop application developed on swings with MVC framework.p  pThe problem I am having is weird.  The application shows the popups properly on the devs box.  But the same application when deployed on to the actual machine behaves inappropriately.  The popups seem to be appearing but they close in a fraction of a second.p  pTo better explain it here is an examplep  ol liWe show a progress popupli liWe prompt a confirmation window.li lipOpen the progress popup.pli lipAgain open the progress popup with a different text.pli liOpen a different confirmation window.li liProgress popup again.li ol  pAll the instances of the popups are singleton.  And we are making sure to reset each instance before displaying other popup.  We even thought it might be because of timer issues and put all of the popups in invokeLater.  Nothing is working on the client machine.p  pWe tried to remote debug it,  when we do that,  the application is working fine with all the popups displaying properly in a sequence.p  pOnce it actually runs by itself.  Some of the popups will be visible and the others just close in a fraction of a second and reappear in the next transaction when its time to show some other popups.p  pAny ideas on thisp

Negative 80988 pHi Im new to Castle Windsor and am struggling to understand some of the basics so I figured I post a question rather than go through the code in hopes of resolving my issue sooner.p  pI have a webservice that needs to pull information from the config file web.config. This information is in a custom configuration section and I am wondering how I can get that information to the class that needs it. I dont want to tie that class to the config file as I may host this through IIS or a custom windows service. My first attempt was to do something like thisp  precodeiocCon.RegisterComponent.ForltErrorMessagesSectiongt.LifeStyle.Singleton.InstanceFindConfigSectionltErrorMessagesSectiongt   private T FindConfigSectionltTgt where T  ConfigurationSection              System.Configuration.Configuration config  System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.OpenWebConfigurationweb.configTODO remove this hard coding to iis hosting  .OpenExeConfigurationConfigurationUserLevel.None         ConfigurationSectionGroupCollection sectionGroups  config.SectionGroups          foreach ConfigurationSectionGroup sectionGroup in sectionGroups             foreach ConfigurationSection configurationSection in sectionGroup.Sections                 if configurationSection.GetType  typeofT                     return T configurationSection         return null      codepre  pThe section can only be defined once so this basically grabs the section so it can be injected into the constructor of an error message factory class. This doesnt throw any errors however Ive noticed that the section gets created twice which is causing other problems which I should fix but... anyway to get around this I decided I would create the single instance and register it myself so I triedp  precodeUGLYHACK  new ConfigFileErrorMessageManagereMessages iocContationer.RegisterComponent.ForltIErrorMessageManagergt.ImplementedByltConfigFileErrorMessageManagergt.LifeStyle.Singleton.InstanceUGLYHACK codepre  pThat is the first registration of a just created container and it blows up with the followingp  precode[ComponentRegistrationException This component has already been assigned implementation xxx.ConfigFileErrorMessageManager] Castle.MicroKernel.Registration.ComponentRegistration1.ImplementedByType type,     IGenericImplementationMatchingStrategy genericImplementationMatchingStrategy 310  Castle.MicroKernel.Registration.ComponentRegistration1.InstanceTService instance 44 codepre  pMy first question how is this error possible nothing else has been registered  or does it mean something more subtle than it seems to Second question what is the best practice for getting configuration info to the classes that need it am I going about this wrongp  pThanks for your helpp

Negative 80988 pI have created an on the fly search field in Java Swing. I have a JTextField where you enter what to search for, and a JList inside a JScrollPane that contains the matches on your input. When you write in the JTextField, it controls the JScrollPane The contents of it, and if it should be visible or not.p  pIt works fine when I create a sample window using it, but not in my big GUI. I cant explain the GUI, so I dont expect you to solve this entirely, but maybe answer a question about it.p  pThe thing is, that when the JTextField is empty or we find no hits, the list is hidden setVisiblefalse. When you start typing, and it found at least one item, its shown setVisibletrue. When I start up my GUI, and I start typing in the search field, the list isnt shown as it should. It simply doesnt appear. I have debugged the code, and the scrollpane IS set to visible  true. It is visible according to the running code, but I cant see it and I cant interact with it. Its not hidden behind something else.p  pNow to the funny thing. If I type something that should generate a hit, and then hover over the JTextField, activating its tooltip, the JScrollBar appears After that has happened, the search field acts normally, until I close the window. The visible flag is not changed, but somehow it decided that now we can paint it.p  pNow I want to know, what happens when a tooltip is shown Is there some special painting going on that I could call myselfp

Negative 80988 pIn cocos2diphone the default projection type is 3D projection. But you can also set the projection to 2D like so p  precode[[CCDirector sharedDirector] setProjectionCCDirectorProjection2D] codepre  pBehind the scenes the 3D projection uses perspective projection whereas 2D projection is the OpenGL orthographic projection. a hrefhttpwww.songho.caopenglglprojectionmatrix.html relnofollowThe technical details about these two projection modes can be reviewed herea, thats strongnotstrong what Im interested in.p  pstrongWhat are the benefits and drawbacks of 2D projection for cocos2d users What are good reasons to switch to 2D projectionstrongp  pPersonally Ive used 2D projection to be able to use depth buffering for isometric tilemaps. Isometric tilemaps require this for correct z ordering of tiles and objects on the tilemap.p  pIve also used 2D projection with depth buffering in nontilemap projects to get complete z order control via the vertexZ property. This project used a pseudo isometric display where the vertexZ of an object is based on its Y coordinate.p  pThat means Ive been using 2D projection only to be able to use the vertexZ property, which also requires enabling depth buffering. Are there any other reasons one might want to switch to 2D projectionp

Negative 80988 pI am building a dictionary and want to limit the number of results the user can get. In my HTML page, I have a set of radio buttons that define the range in which the user can limit is search. 1  simple, 2  easy, 3  meduim, 4  hard, 7  all. This is defined by a database value attached to the entries, Difficulty. I am trying to limit the search with the following code, but it is not returning any results. searchlimit is the radio value. p  precodeifstrcmpsearchlimit, 1                      sql .  and Difficulty is null or Difficulty  1 and          rownumlt500 . searchorder              elseif strcmpsearchlimit, 2                   sql .  and Difficulty  gt 1 or Difficulty lt 3 and     rownumlt500 . searchorder                  elseif strcmpsearchlimit, 3                       sql .  and Difficulty  gt 4 or Difficulty lt 6 and     rownumlt500 . searchorder                  else                      sql .  and Difficulty lt 7 or rownumlt500 . searchorder          codepre  pWhat I am having trouble with is the Difficulty  x or Difficulty lt x. If I default the search limit to the else statement, it returns everything with difficulty 7 the max and under correctly. Similarly, if I replace the 7 in the else statement with any other number below 7, it also works correctly. I just cant get the defined search to work.p
Negative 80988 pI have a setup I am trying to build that basically acts as a web browser proxy.p  pBasically, we have an app which we have written which iPhone users are able to bookmark to their home screen.  When they view the content in our application, occasionally they will get a URL that directs them to another website.  When they follow this URL after launching the app from their home screen it loads it in the app itself, removing the app that they were working on which is not okay behavior for our application.  I have been told that if we add a querystring  at the end of it then it will launch the new page in Safari instead.p  pThis would be acceptable behavior, except when they bring up the application from their home screen again it reloads the page and they lose their place from wherever they were at which, again, is not acceptable.p  pTo circumvent this, for iPhone users, I have added in a div that is intended to be used to load the page they wanted to view INSIDE of our application so they can still have a back button to get back to where they were.  This would be perfect, except we are getting security sandbox violations when trying to load the external page obviouslyp  pWhat would you guys recommend in order to resolve this problem  Keep in mind that there is more than one way to skin this cat and Im perfectly happy going with a better solution if anyone has any suggestions.p  pThe only suggestion I can come up with is for us to turn the app into a native iOS application so that when the user leaves the application it can multitask in the background and retain its state.  We want to avoid this if at all possible as there are a whole slew of extra logistics we would have to incorporate to get this to work with our other tools we are using.p

Negative 80988 pForgive me to the obtuse title, as Im unsure how to describe this question.p  pRecently many iOS apps utilise a scrolling UI design pattern which helps to maximise screen realestate, typically hiding the header when the user scrolls downwards.p  pFor example, Instragrams main view has the Instragram header at the top. Scrolling upwards on this view keeps the header fixed at the top, and the view bounces back normally to the top of the content. But scroll down and the header acts as part of the content, making way for an extra 44 points of vertical space.p  pIts probably that I havent done much iOS work in a while, but I cant easily figure out how best to impliment this Apologies for the terrible description.p

Negative 80988 pIm currently learning Java by developing a tool for creating and filling out multiplechoiceforms clientside and saving aswell as evaluating them serverside. I used a code skeleton from a RMI Tutorial for the networkpart and it was working fine until just now.

So the Server doesnt really load the ClientApp, but instead somehow magically accesses its GUI and showing it for no reason.p  pI already tried stepping into the line before the GUI is loaded, but I end up in an infinite loop eventually, so I really have no idea what is going an.p  pThis is my first question here, so please forgive me if I missed out anything obvious.

Negative 80988 pWe have an admin site that requires authentication for access. The pages on the site are wrapped in a Coldfusion custom tag, which includes all the styles and JS, as well as a few other pieces of info.p  pI recently made a copy of the custom tag wrapper. I put the copy in the same directory as the original which is mapped through the Coldfusion administrator, and renamed the file.  I added a few cssjs includes in the new custom tag.  And I changed the custom tag used in the site from the old one to this new one.p  pNow when nonadmin users go to the site  the same users who had access to the site before and who had no problems when the site had the old custom tag wrapper  they are being asked to login multiple times.  They can hit cancel, and some of the CSS styles do not render, but the rest of the page shows up fine. p  pI automatically assumed the problem was in one of the new CSS or JS files I added to the new custom tag.  But, I checked each of these files individually in IIS, and they all have anonymous access turned on.  Even removing them from the custom tag doesnt change the fact that the users are being asked to login typically 3 times every time they go to a page. p  pAnonymous access is turned on for all the existing CSS and JS files. I checked every one of the files individually not just at the directory level, which also is set to anonymous access. Could the new custom tag itself have something to do with it.  The custom tag is mapped through ColdFusion Administrator, so Im not sure how I would check its IIS authentication settings... it doesnt show up there as part of the site.p  pAnything else I can checkp

Negative 80988 pstrongBackgroundstrong Im trying to optimize the speed of my Node.js API, built with Express and Mongoose on the Amazon Cloud. I have one API call that takes a good amount of time to run my stats API call compiles data from lots of sources, and thus makes hundreds of mongo queries and thus takes about 20 seconds to run. I have noticed that, while this API call is running, other API calls that also hit the Mongo replica set are slow to return. My first thought was that the stats queries were slow, thus blocking, but according to my stat panel I dont have any queries taking  100ms to run, and also my Mongo DB stats are all in pretty healthy ranges 20 queries per second, lt1 btree miss, lt5 lock.p  pstrongQuestionstrong Right now, my Node.js app establishes a single connection to the Mongo set on startup, and all queries use that connection. Would it be better to establish multiple connections Eg, should I establish a new Mongo connection for each inbound API request, instead Or, maybe I should have a static number of connections to the replica set, and loadbalance between those connections when executing queriesp  pOr maybe Im completely offbasep

Any other ideas on how to pick out a value or a set of values connected to a node called e.g. emshabongemp  pIm used to the codeXDocumentcode class in C where one only needs to specify the name of a descendant to get a bunch of information contained in a tag. A similar solutions would be preferable. Old dog, new tricks, hehe.p

Negative 80988 pIm having a problem getting the helper method specified in my ServiceKnownType attribute to run.

Negative 80988 pI have a custom Outlook addin where I add a ribbon. In the ribbon I have a few buttons to control my process which I run on a background thread.

I do this with the codeRibbonButton.Enabledcode property. However, I then need to update the ribbon to reflect that the buttons are disabled.

Negative 80988 pI would like to connect multiple printers via USB and send printfiles to each of them.  I understand that printers are listed as codedevusblp0code, codedevusblp1code, where currently, I am using this python instruction to send a file to the printerp  precodefor files in os.listdirfolderwithprintfiles         shutil.copyfilefolderwithprintfiles, devusblp0 codepre  pHowever, I have noticed that Linux does not label codelp0code and codelp1code in any particular order.  Since I am sending files to the printer like this, I do NOT want to use CUPS to get the information for each of my printers.  I would rather not make my print calls dependent on searching for a driver, since I will already have these files formatted for these printers. Instead, I want to find an alternative approach in attaining the printer information for lp lp0, lp1, etc.  I would preferably like to do this through python, or go through the Linux kernel with using codeoscode functions. Any suggestionsp

Negative 80988 pI realise that this is not really the type of question that should be asked on this forum, since it does not have a single answer, but stack overflow has been such an awesome resource in the past that I hope you will forgive me this one time.p  pOur problem is as follows We have a product, which is a relative straightforward windows forms application that provide typical dataentry and searching capabilities onto a database. We have a client with offices in London and Hong Kong and they want to share the data between the offices. Previously they have accomplished this using a single server in London and using Citrix or Remote desktop to run against that databae.p  pThe users in Hong Kong complain rightly so about the speed of this solution. We have some competitors that apparently have this cracked, so we need to come up with a solution very quickly or possibly lose the client.p  pI am, unfortunately, not very experienced with distributed solutions. I can only think of two options.p  ol lipInstall a Sqlserver in Hong Kong with merge replication between the two servers and run the desktop client against the new server. My main problem with this is that other people in the company have only horror stories when it comes to SQL merge replication. Their experience is a bit dated, so does anyone know how easy it is to set up and maintain in the newer versions.pli lipThe second option I see is to create WCF services that sit in Hong Kong and connect to the London system, allowing for caching of large amounts of data, hopefully resulting in acceptable performance. The main problem here is that it is a legacy product that currently talks directly to the database. This means that I will first have to introduce a service layer, which will be a lot of work. This will of course be good for the product anyway, but I am hesitant to suggest this solution if I am not even sure how well it will work and what the performance will be at the end of the day.pli ol  pDoes anyone have any advice to offer Some other options that I am not aware of Or maybe people who went down the one route and had to swap to the other for some or other reasonp  pI realise this is very vague, but any help will be appreciated.p

Negative 80988 pPHP 5.5 is adding support for codefinallycode in trycatch blocks.  p  pJava allows you to create a trycatchfinally block with no catch block, so you can cleanup locally when an exception happens, but let the exception itself propagate up the call stack so it can be dealt with separately.  p  precodetry       Do something that might throw an exception here  finally       Do cleanup and let the exception propagate  codepre  pIn current versions of PHP you can achieve something that can do cleanup on an exception and let it propagate, but if no exception is thrown then the cleanup code is never called.  p  precodetry       Do something that might throw an exception here  catch Exception e       Do cleanup and rethrow     throw e  codepre  pWill PHP 5.5 support the tryfinally style  I have looked for information on this, but the closest I could find to an answer, from PHP.net, only implies that it doesnt.  p  blockquote   pIn PHP 5.5 and later, a finally block may also be specified after the   catch blocks. Code within the finally block will always be executed   after the try and catch blocks, regardless of whether an exception has   been thrown, and before normal execution resumes.p blockquote  pThe wording suggests that youre always expected to have a catch block, but it doesnt state it outright as far as I can see.  p

Negative 80988 pI have an assignment where I am supposed to create a prototype drawing program to display and manipulate faces. It is supposed to use 2 windows, one to draw the face and the other to control the drawing. It is supposed to initially show the image of a face drawn with shapes. p  pThe face consists of a head, two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Each of these parts is selected by clicking the mouse within the border of the object.

Negative 80988 pI am using a viewpager with fragments, the number of fragments is usually around 4 to 5. ATM I have an adview inside each of the fragment. But that would mean calling up 4 to 5 adviews  which are held in the parent Activity. Which doesnt seem to be efficient, and I am not sure if it is in accordance with AdMobs policies.  Or is it better to place the ad below the viewpager and it will remain fixed. I am also using navigation drawers, I am a little worried if it will cause other problems.  p  pAlso is it ok to use a singleton to cache the adview across activities. As it will reduce the need to fetch a new adview each timep
Negative 80988 pI have an SVG sprite with icons for buttons. The icons are added to the HTML link elements as a background image.p  pI would like to use percentages to position the sprite, but its confusing.

Negative 80988 pI just updated Newtonsoft.Json library from 4.5.1 to 5.0.8. What I noticed is that one of the exception messages changed. Once the value cant be deserialized, the following is contained in my 400 response, Error converting value.... Now, this message was different in the 4.5.1. version of the lib.

Till the version 4.5.1 of the Newtonsoft.Json library, once the JsonSerializationException was thrown, the message in the response just specified that a certain object was unable to be serialized.

It seems though, that after returning from the display method, something happens that causes the GL object to defunction, like when I want to get an available textureID by calling codeglGenBuffers1, buffercode I recieve code0code  not a valid textureID to load a texture into.p  pIs there a way to make the GL object work outside of the display method codegl.getContext.makeCurrentcode does not change anything ...p  pEdit After tinkering around, it seems that the call to glGenTextures does actually nothing  when I create a texture within the display method and then call it later from outside the call to display, I get the same textureID that was in the buffer before  so the call does not change the value within the buffer  also codeglGetErrorcode returns 0 ...p  pEdit2 a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7414841javaopengljoglwhathappensbehindthesceneswhenicallthedisplaymetrq1Java openGL JOGL What happens behind the scenes when I call the display methoda contained that question, but no answer was given on how to do it.

Negative 80988 pIm currently working on an app whose database schema changes frequently. This rapid change creates a big problem for my frontend Angular code which consumes the backend JSON API which I dont have much control over via Restangular take the following code for examplep  precodeltulgt     ltli ngrepeatitem in itemsgt         lth2gtitem.labellth2gt     ltligt ltulgt codepre  pThere will be a lot of template tags like codeitem.labelcode scattered everywhere in the frontend code, so whenever the property name changes from, say label to itemlabel, Ill need to remember where those tags are and change all of them. Of course, I could do a project wide search and replace, but thats not really ideal from an DRY stand point and itll also be a maintenance nightmare.p  pMy question is, does Angular or Restangular provide a way to map model property names to custom ones like a hrefhttpsengineering.groupon.com2012javascriptextendingbackbonejstomaproughapiresponsesintobeautifulclientsidemodels relnofollowthis in Backboneap  pThat way, I can just have something like thisp  precode     label model.itemlabel  codepre  pthen next time when the itemlabel is changed to something else, I can just update it in this configuration object and not worry about all the references in the templates.p  pThanks.p

Negative 80988 pI have been reading a number of article on WCF Buffer Pools and cant seem to figure it out.  I have a queued wcf service net.msmq that accepts a string as a parameter.  If the service gets hammered say it gets 64 insances pulling messages off the queue the RAM jumps up pretty high say around 300MB based off of 1MB messages in the queue.  After the queue is processed that memory doesnt get released.  My questions arep  ol liWhat size objects go to large heap  Is it 85kli liSay if messages will always be 1MB, should my max buffer size be 1MBli liIf max buffer size is 1MB and I expect 64 instances, should max pool be 64MBli liHow can I get my service to release unused memory  I heard that large heap doesnt get cleaned up unless you cycle app pool.  Is this correctli ol  pI basically want to setup the service so it can get hammered and recover freeing up memory for other services when it is idle.p

Negative 80988 pI read that destructors need to be defined when we have pointer members and when we define a base class, but I am not sure if I completely understand. One of the things I am not sure about is whether or not defining a default constructor is useless or not, since we are always given a default constructor by default. Also, I am not sure if we need to define default constructor to implement the RAII principle do we just need to put resource allocation in a constructor and not define any destructor.p  precodeclass A   public     Account              delete [] brandname         delete b          do we need to define it            something 0 virtual function reason 1 base class  private     char brandname cstyle string, which is a pointer member reason 2 has a pointer member     B b instance of class B, which is a pointer member reason 2     vectorltBgt vec what about this      class B public A      public something          cout ltlt nothing ltlt endl           in all other cases we dont need to define the destructor, nor declare it  codepre

Negative 80988 pI have a collection referencing GridFS files, generally 12 files per record. The collections are reasonably large  about 705k records in the parent collection, and 790k GridFS files. Over time, there have become a number of orphaned GridFS files  the parent records were deleted, but the referenced files werent. Im now attempting to clean the orphaned files out of the GridFS collection.p  pThe problem with an approach like suggested a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17684561gridfscleanoutallunreferencedfilesherea is that combining the 700k records into a single large list of ids results in a Python list thats about 4mb in memory  passing that into a nin query in Mongo on the fs.files collection takes literally forever. Doing the reverse get a list of all ids in fs.files and querying the parent collection to see if they exist also takes forever.p  pHas anybody come up against this and developed a faster solutionp

Negative 80988 pSO... p  pI have a Java FX application that runs an embedded HTTP Live Streaming server for video playback using the Media class NOT live streaming, video on demand.

When my HttpHandler is called to handle the get request for the files entries in the .m3u8 index file, I plan on... p  ul liLoading the file into memoryli liCreating a byte array of the RAW H264 packetsli liConvert wrap the RAW H264 to a MPEG2 TS ffmpeg i video.h264 video.tsli liWrite the MPEG2 TS contents to the response body so that it can be playedli ul  p...one of my requirements is that I am not able to create local files, even temp ones. So I cannot create a .h264 file, use ffmpeg to create a .ts file, read the ts file and then write the contents to the response body. p  pAs far as I can tell, Xuggler does not work with streams and JCodec is slow. I am fairly confident that I can dig into and understand the MPEG2 TS format and simply convert the RAW H264 into the appropriate format, but this seems like a lot of needless work that should have been done before. p  pAnyone know of a simple way to convert RAW H264 to MPEG2 TS Or MP4 to MPEG2 TS I can use MP4Parser to create the MP4 data in memory quickly, I just need a java library that can generate MPEG2 TS data, thanksp

This works fine for files of 400MB or so no problem.  When I tested a 16GB file however is where the problem is.  I believe from my understanding that Apache is no longer limiting the upload by size and that changing the above settings must have helped otherwise my 400 MB file wouldnt work. p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pAfter the upload progress bar finishes, the page displays an error message that I have put in place if the directory location, saved in the session variable, is missing. Therefore I believe that the session may be timing out and forgetting the session variable. After the upload progress, which takes roughly an hour, is when the message is displayed.  p  pstrongWhat I have triedstrongp  pAfter doing some research I have tried changing the following, just to see if it made a difference evenp  psession.gcmaxlifetime  36000p  p36000 should  10 hours. I would not keep it here eventually but just did it for testing. Even changing this still results in what I believe is timing out.

Negative 80988 pI tried looking through the forums for an answer to this but I think it is too specific to my case.p  pI am writing an image reduction script using python and pyraf. It prompts the user if certain IRAF tasks need to be completed using rawinputQuestion. I have one line, pasted below, that is skipped when I first run the script. If I rerun the script though immediately after, it isnt skipped. The script skips this prompt and goes immediately to the next one, so this step in the reduction is completely missed.p  pDoes anyone know why this would occur Or if this is answered somewhere else already and I just missed itp  precodeskyslitinputWhich slit is for sky Enter 0 if no sky slit 1  for i in rangelenrows2     if rawinputNeed to combine flats, normalize response and divide from comparisons and science frames   yes         Making lists of individual slit files and normalized files         szflat,junk,szflatslistfilesflats[0][55]sstri1,begz.         szcomp,nszcomp,szcompslistfilescomps[0][55]sstri1,begz.,biasyes,appendn         scrzsci,nscrzsci,scrzscislistfilesscis[0][55]sstri1,begcrz.,biasyes,appendn         Combine flats into master file         iraf.unlearniraf.flatcombine         iraf.flatcombineszflat,outputszflats[0][55]sstri1,combineaverage,rejectminmax,ccdtypenone,processno,subsetsno,delete no,rdnoiseRDNOISE,gainGAIN         print Created Master Flat file szflats[0][55]sstri1.fits         Normalize flat response for each slit         iraf.noao.twodspec.longslit.responseszflats[0][55]sstri1.fits,szflats[0][55]sstri1.fits,Resszflats[0][55]sstri1.fits, interacyes, functiochebyshev, order30         print Normalized Flat response for each slit         Divide Comps and Science frames by Normalized Flat         Make lists for extracted files         ccdprocszcomp,nszcomp,szcomps,flatyes,flatfileResszflats[0][55]sstri1.fits         ccdprocscrzsci,nscrzsci,scrzscis,flatyes,flatfileResszflats[0][55]sstri1.fits         print Divided Comp and Science frames by Normalized Flat      Combine consecutive, normalized Comparison spectra in batches     ccompssortedglob.globnz.comps[0][55]sstri1.fits     num[]     for c in ccomps num.appendfloatc[36]     sets[]     lis[num[0]]     n1     while n lt lennum         if num[n]num[n1]  1. lis.appendnum[n]         if num[n]num[n1] gt 1.             sets.appendlis             lis[num[n]]         if n  lennum1 sets.appendlis         n1     l0     Creating file lists     complist     compfiles[]     while l lt lensets         ind[num.indexn for n in sets[l]]         comblist         for n in ind comblistccomps[n],         iraf.imcombinecomblist[1],nzCompstrlcomps[0][5comps[0].index]sstri1.fits,combineaverage,rejectminmax         data,hpy.getdatanzCompstrlcomps[0][5comps[0].index]sstri1.fits,headerTrue         del h[CCDSEC]         py.writetonzCompstrlcomps[0][5comps[0].index]sstri1.fits,data,h,clobberTrue         complistnzCompstrlcomps[0][5comps[0].index]sstri1.fits,         compfiles.appendnzCompstrlcomps[0][5comps[0].index]sstri1.fits         l1      Find wavelength solution     Using the combined comparison files     if rawinputNeed to find wavelength solution   yes THIS IS WHAT IS SKIPPED         for im in compfiles             iraf.noao.twodspec.longslit.identifyim,coordligoodmanhgar.dat,match10,fwidth7,thresho10,niter1                iraf.noao.twodspec.longslit.reidentifyim,im,interacno,coordligoodmanhgar.dat,nlost5,thresho10,match10,traceno,overridyes,verboseyes             iraf.noao.twodspec.longslit.fitcoordsim[5]             scifilessortedglob.globncrz.scis[0][55]sstri1.fits             imnum[]             for s in scifiles imnum.appends[58]             first,lastinputFirst and last number of science frames that correspond to this Comparison string.

Negative 80988 pIm having performance problems with codeorg.hibernate.Criteriacode, because Im fetching too many rows from the data base to populate my primefaces datatable. p  pI have successfully solved this problem for other tables in my system by using codeorg.hibernate.SQLQuerycode and building my entities my self.p  pBut in this particular case, I do not want to stop using criteria because there are a lot of filters and ordering in the table thats already implemented with codeCriteriacode...p  pSo my question is... is it possible to get my codeCriteriacode object, with all the restrictions and orders that I set, and instead of using codemyCriteria.listcode, use something else that runs just the SQL from this codeCriteriacode and returns something like the codeorg.hibernate.Query.listcode where I could construct the entities my selfp  pTHanksp

Negative 80988 pMy understanding is that floats are internally represented as binary expansion, and that introduces errors. If that is the case, then why are float literals represented as are given Suppose that code0.1code is represented internally as code0.0999999999999999code according to binary expansion I am using a fake example, just to show the point. This particular value is probably not correct.. Then in inspection or in the return value of irb, why does itwhy is it possible to print the given literal code0.1code and not code0.0999999999999999code Isnt the original literal form gone once it is interpreted and expanded into binaryp  pIn other words, a float literaltointernal binary expression is a manytoone mapping. Different float literals that are close enough are mapped to the same internal binary expression. Why then is it possible to reconstruct the original literal from the internal expression modulo differences between code1.10code and code1.1code, code1.23e2code code123.0code as in Mark Dickinsons commentp

Negative 80988 pI have a Cordova application that I currently use on Android and iOS. This cross platform app uses an external URL as its start page. This works great in Android, iOS and even WP8 but if I add the Windows 8 platform to my Cordova project, the application will not build. p  pI have found Windows 8 Store Apps running HTML5Javascript must use local content only. I have been trying to find a way to make my app build but I am not getting very far. I would have thought I would have found similar complaints online but I strangely have found none. p  pI have thought about trying to use an iFrame within a local HTML page and point it to my external content but runs into formatting issues and lack of plugin support. p  pI wish CordovaPhoneGap would not use a HTML5Javascript project for Windows 8 but a XAMLC project that embeds a WebView. That is, after all, how all the other main platforms work even WP8. If there was a way to convert the WP8 project to a Windows 8 app then I could possibly substitute it for the limiting Windows 8 HTML5Javascript project. p  pAm I missing something How do I use a Cordova app for Windows 8 using external content I surely cannot be the only developer wanting to do this. p

Negative 80988 pBy setting I mean something that is set, similar to setters in Java amp other OO languages, not Expresss application settings. Is there a way to access and ideally use settings set inside middleware codeusecoded by the app In particular, some middleware is a full Express app, like codevhostcode and the new codeRoutercode middleware that comes with Express 4.x. If you do most of your routing in a virtual host and want to access some route param from the main app, that could be a problem. This is especially true if you have several layers, like Im having, and it would be inconvenient to codeexportcode the setting all the way out to the main app.p  pSo is there a way to access these settings from the main appp

Negative 80988 pThere is an hourlong code.mp3code file on the local disk of an HTTP server. About 10 web clients using recent versions of Chrome or Firefox, with a recent version of Flash installed start downloading that file. The JavaScript or Flash ActionScript on the web page causes the audio in the code.mp3code file to be played on the speakers of the web client computers. Playback of the audio is started before the file download has completed, and the file is not saved to disk on the web client so this is streaming.p  pEach web client user must hear the same audio at about the same time, no matter when he started downloading. Of course, he will miss earlier parts of the audio. The maximum allowed time difference is 30 milliseconds, i.e. if user A hears a particular piece of audio from the file, then user B should also hear it no more than 30 milliseconds later. Its not necessary to have low latency, e.g. its OK to buffer audio for up to 5 seconds preferably only up to 2 seconds on the client side, but the actual playback on the speakers should happen in a synchronized way.p  pLets suppose that the clocks on the clients and the server go at the same speed for the duration of the playback, but they can be set to very different times. The ServerDate JavaScript library a hrefhttpsgithub.comNodeGuyServerDate relnofollowhttpsgithub.comNodeGuyServerDatea or something similar can be used to make the client JavaScript code know about the server time at high accuracy.p  pIts OK to preencode the code.mp3code with any settings e.g. low, constant bitrate. Its also OK to convert it to another lossy compression format supported by the web clients.p  pMy question is how can such a system be implemented What existing technologies e.g. WebRTC, JW Player, other web players can be used What are relevant open source and free software technologies available Can HTML5  JavaScript give better synchronization accuracy than a Flashbased player or does this matter Is an implementation already availablep  pIve found a similar question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8844048mp3websiteplayerwithsynchronizedplaybacknotstreamingmp3 website player with synchronized playback not streaminga My requirements are stricter than that the time difference between web clients shouldnt be more than 30 milliseconds. It also doesnt deal with clock synchronization.p

Negative 80988 pIm trying to build a relatively simple text editor type application for OSX. Im completely new to developing apps and was looking for some suggestions for the best approach to build something to display and edit text in a nonstandard form. Text will be taken from some input file and then edited. I need the window to be structured something like thisp  precodeHeader1   String1 Header2   String2 Header3   String3 etc. codepre  pThere could be a 100s of headers and corresponding strings, with each string potentially being 1000s of characters headers are short. Every character in the string must line up with the corresponding characters on the string below. For example, the 1st character of every string would be in the same column and so on. Since the strings will likely not fit in the window entirely, Id need to scroll to see every character. p  pI need to be able to click on individual characters and perform different actions on them ie. delete character, color character. I also want to be able to select and highlight regions and perform actions on those regions. For example, I may want to select and highlight a region of text and delete it ie. select a column of characters and delete them or maybe select a block of characters and highlight them.p  pIve done a couple Xcode tutorials for building desktop applications and looked through the documentation but havent come across an object that seems to fit the bill. Initially, I thought about using something like NSTableView but I think thatll have too much overhead especially as input files get massive. Any suggestions on possible objects or ways of implementing this I could use to do thisp  pId prefer to not have to literally draw the characters on a coordinate system and build the application that way but am unsure if I have a better option. From what I understand, I could do this using an NSCustomView somehow and the NSLayoutManager. p  pThanks p

Negative 80988 pMy PHP mysql driven website shows a bunch of raw code for about half a second before rendering the website. I have added more mysql queries recently which run before the entire page is generated, but removing them makes no difference. It only comes up after the login process, then when I refresh or even when the browser cache is cleared, but when I logout, it shows again. But the code only shows under Chrome, not when using the Firefox browser. This only started to occur last week.p  pWhat is the reason for this, and how can this be preventedp  pBelow is the initial Javascript code that recognizes the screen resolution in order to later adjust the dimensions of different HTML elements it checks if the resolution is already recognised through a GET variable, if not, then the same page is reloaded once. When I remove this code and have the page directly go to the PHP, the raw code does not show. I believe the raw code that shows up is this Javascript. But this problem did not occur before, this website has operated in this fashion with this code for over a yearp  precode    adj  0 if issetGET[adj] adj  intvalGET[adj]  Anpassung an Browserfensteraufloesung   if emptyadj   gt ltDOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC W3CDTD HTML 4.01EN httpwww.w3.orgTRhtml4strict.dtdgt   ltscript languagejavascriptgt      Browserfensteraufloesung wird erkannt      if typeof window.innerWidth   number           NonIE         browserwidth  window.innerWidth         browserheight  window.innerHeight      else if  document.documentElement ampamp  document.documentElement.clientWidth  document.documentElement.clientHeight            IE 6 in standards compliant mode         browserwidth  document.documentElement.clientWidth         browserheight  document.documentElement.clientHeight      else if document.body ampamp  document.body.clientWidth  document.body.clientHeight            IE 4 compatible         browserwidth  document.body.clientWidth         browserheight  document.body.clientHeight            var browserwidthprevious  lt echo screenwidth gt     var browserheightprevious  lt echo screenheight gt      if browserwidth  browserwidthprevious  browserheight  browserheightprevious           var datum  lt echo datumrange gt         var datumvon  lt echo datumvon gt         var datumbis  lt echo datumbis gt         var dateiname  lt echo searchdateiname gt         var dateinamedefault  lt echo searchdateinamedefault gt         if dateiname  dateinamedefault dateiname    Notwendig, damit nicht nach diesem Defaultwert gesucht wird         var status  lt echo encodingstatus gt         var kdnrsearchstrg           var kdnr  lt echo kundennummer gt          if kdnr  lt echo adminkdnr gt                  kdnrsearchstrg  ampKdnrsearch  lt echo kdnrsearch gt          newlocation  kundendatenviewer.phpDatumrange  datum  ampDatumvon  datumvon  ampDatumbis  datumbis  ampBrowserWinWidth  browserwidth  ampBrowserWinHeight  browserheight  ampSearchdateiname  dateiname  ampEncodingstatus  status  kdnrsearchstrg  ampadj1         alert  Location   newlocation     window.location  newlocationkundendatenviewerdebug.phpBrowserWinWidth  browserwidth  ampBrowserWinHeight  browserheight  ampDatumrange  datum  ampSearchdateiname  dateiname  ampEncodingstatus  status  kdnrsearchstrg  ampadj1       else alert browserwidth      browserwidthprevious     ltscriptgt  ltphp  codepre

Negative 80988 pI apologize if this is not the right place to ask but I would like some advice on how to approach my coding issue. I am trying to implement a splay tree recursively. I know iteratively would be better but that is not an option for me. I understand that basically, splaying means that I would bring the node I am accessing to the root. I am confused on how to implement the splay method. p  pWould it be necessary to keep a height or depth attribute associated with each node In order to splay, I would need to know whether the node is a direct child of the root or several generations down. Also, Is it necessary to keep parent pointers, or can this be avoidedp  pI guess I am having trouble forming the pseudocode and determining what supplementary functions I would need to write. I know I would probably have to write a single leftright rotation and double leftright rotation method but beyond that Im not sure. I appreciate any advice.p

Negative 80988 pWhat I have is part descriptions that I have split into separate columns.  All columns have headings, but not all columns contain information for every part, ex some might have size, material, and temp while another may have just size and temp.  I have a function to concatenate them which ignores the blank spaces.  I want to reference the header for the column before each cell I am concatenating. p  pDesired resultsp  pWhen entering the following in B6  ConcatenateRangeValveG6J6,,p  pI want to see these results. [ITEM]Valve,[TYPE]Gate,[DIM]28INp  pThe items in [ ] are in Row 11 and I am having trouble getting my function to reference that row with the same column that I am in to pull the header.  I think what it needs is to identify where the cell I am working in is in the whole spreadsheet.  I attempted to do this by defining C, setting its value as the column number of the first cell in my range and then increasing it by 1 as it steps though the loop.  I cannot get it to work.

Negative 80988 pWe have a large lineofbusiness application based on Filemaker Pro 13. It consists of 50 binary files ranging from 10MB to 5GB. I would like to use Git to manage versioning of this system. I understand that I cant leverage the best benefit of Git, which is textbased diffing, but Git and the rest of the surrounding ecosystem of tools would be beneficial to us. In my case, many of these files have small changes or restructurings that could be in any of the 50 files for any changeset or node.p  pIs Git currently a good tool for managing a relatively fixed set of mutable binary files Do I need an extension If so, which If not Git, what to usep

The algorithm ends when the end of the list is reached.p      pWhat is the worstcase running time for a list of size n p blockquote  pI feel that it is similar with bubble sort, but probably worse that that because it doesnt finish the whole pass of scanning the list.

I cant even login through admin, cause that page is also broken.p  pThe only thing i remember doing differently is that i turned compilation and css merging on before moving the files.p  pThe store is at a hrefhttpwww.atelieminimalista.com.brloja relnofollowhttpwww.atelieminimalista.com.brlojaa and, as you can see, the css and images dont load and the links are all weird, with an dash missing. The database definitions are fine i guess, i changed the secure and unsecure link. If you go to admin, its also weird.p  pI tried to check htaccess, deleted the cache, but everything seems fine. Im not a full experienced programmer, and this is pretty urgent, so any help would be great.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 80988 pAn implementation for a complex formula requires me to explode a series of strings and values into a 2 dimensional array.

I find that its not fast enough so i tried withp  ul liPREPARED STATEMENT. Result is also the same. The total table that i need to insert is 80 tables for 3000 records. Is it because of the compilation of different tables that slows down the optimization processli liBULK INSERT. By bulk insert i mean using a insert statement together with values that is concatenated by using UNION ALL keyword. The result is even slower by a second. About 23 to 27 seconds.li ul  pIs it possible that sqlite has already optimized the individual statements so that whatever optimization that ive tried is actually useless Im expecting some serious performance gains by doing so but i just dont see any improvements at all. Really need help in this. Thanks guys.p  pRegards, Dexterp

Negative 80988 pI am in the process of converting my working VB 2010 forms application to Visual Studio 2013.  Ive encountered a nullreferenceexception where one does not occur in the old code.  Basically, I start with a fresh instance of the form.  The form contains a treeview and the user can navigate down through it and select a node.  Based on their selection another portion of the form gets populated a datagridview with the associated elements.  This is an explore screen.p  pWhen the user is done exploring, the application captures the node they were on and saves it.  Immediately, the form is closed, disposed and set to nothing NULL.p  precode Class variable definition Private XInvenNode As New TreeNode  If fdiaXInven Is Nothing Then fdiaXInven  New diaExploreInvenTrue, True fdiaXInven.tvInven.SelectedNode  XInvenNode fdiaXInven.ShowDialog XInvenNode  .tvInven.SelectedNode results  .SelectedItems fdiaXInven.Close fdiaXInven.Dispose fdiaXInven  Nothing codepre  pIf the user returns to the explorer screen in the same session, it is instantiated again and the saved tree node is supposed to be restored so the user can continuing exploring in the same area.

Negative 80988 pI am developing this macro in Excel vba that will loop through a column of client names that are sorted from a to z and check to see which ones are similar and assign them the same client ID in the column adjacent to it.  I am using the codeLikecode operator to compare the names but for some reason it is not picking up on the similarities between the Names.  For example, I want it to think that Aetna and Aetna Medicaid are the same thing because they both contain Aetna.  I am not sure if this operator was meant to do this and if not, what would be the best way to go about this.  I have pasted the code below.  It is in the preliminary stages so for now it just outputs a codeMsgBoxcode instead of assigning the client ID.  Also, the range is defined by a function which just sets it as a one column range.  Any help would be greatly appreciatedp  precodeFunction SetInternalClientID  Sheet9.Activate  ColumnsJJ.Select Selection.Insert ShiftxlToRight, CopyOriginxlFormatFromLeftOrAbove  Set rng2  FindHeaderCLIENT NAME, Sheet9.Name  Count  0  For i  73 To rng2.Rows.Count  ClientCheck  rng2.Cellsi, 1.Value Like rng2.Cellsi  1, 1.Value  If ClientCheck  True Then  MsgBox rng2.Cellsi, 1 amp  Like  amp rng2.Cellsi  1, 1.Value  Else  MsgBox rng2.Cellsi, 1 amp  NOT LIKE  amp rng2.Cellsi  1, 1.Value  End If  Next i   End Function codepre

Negative 80988 pWe are trying to create rectangle annotation to  highlight some text in a page form based on supplied coordinates. While using the same coordinates to create rectangle annotation for the same text in same location in other similar pages, the annotation is getting created somewhere else instead of the desired text location. These issue may be because of the offset difference in the pages as we are suspecting. Is there any way to resolve this issue Any assistance will be highly appreciated.

Negative 80988 pI have a scroll view with for example 3 subviews. They are aligned one above another, with constraints keeping them 16 points apart.p  pWhen I scroll up and down the scroll view, I want there to be some lag between the views, almost like a spring animation. Imagine pulling a spring up the top ones move fast, while the lower ones take a bit longer to come up and bounce around before settling.p  pI tried animating a change in the constant values for the constraints, but this does not give the effect I am going for.p  pIs this effect possible, and how would I achieve thisp

Negative 80988 pHey guys so I wrote a code which was able to take in user input from a tester file and create a graph using edges and vertices. Now I am trying to transpose the my original graph I already came up with a function to do this. I did so by creating a function outside of main and now all I want to do is print out the transpose graph. I think I need to make some kind of print statement inside my main function that connects to my transpose function but I am not sure how to. I hope this makes sense Sorry if I do not. Any ideas of how I can make this happen. Ill show my transpose function belowp  p Returns a new graph which is the transpose of the old graph p  precode    IntList transposeGraphIntList origGraph, int n declaring a function that would return IntList            if origGraph  NULL if graph is empty then terminate              printfGraph Error calling transpose on Null Graphn             exit1                        IntList transGraph             IntList tempList  creating an IntList called tempList              transGraph   callocn1, sizeofIntList allocating memory space                int i                fori  1 i lt n  i                transGraph[i]  intNil setting arrays to null                                 fori  1 i lt n  i                     tempList  origGraph[i]                    while tempList  intNil                             int vert  intFirsttempList                           transGraph[vert]  intConsi, transGraph[vert]                           tempList  intResttempList  reverse                                                             return transGraph transpose the graph      codepre

Negative 80988 pI am trying to write a connector using cURL to connect to a REST API.p  pThe first step the user have to do is creates a session using codecreateSessioncode. This will send a codePOSTcode call to the API with a username and a password. The API will respond with a sessionId, a cookie value and couple of custom header.p  pThe session is only valid for 3 minutes after each valid request. If I make a request after the session has expired I will get codehttp error code 401code which indicates that the user is unauthorized to make the request because the sessionId is invalid or timed out. p  pInstead of asking the user to login again manually, I would like to automatically reconnect by calling the codecreateSessioncode method when I get error 401. The reason why I need to do this because the sessionId is save in the client cookies and so the client does not know if the session is expired or active. My code will try to call methods using the sessionId that is saved in the cookies weather it is active or expired. p  pThe API will renew the session 3 minutes each time a request is made as long as the session is still active. The only time I will need to reconnect is only when the user have not made a request for 3 minutes.p  pThe issue that I am running into is when I try to reconnnect, I go into an infinite loop that I cant figure out how to stop it.p  pHere is my codep  precodeltphp namespace API     ICWS API     package ICWS   class ICWS       private myAppName  ICWS API connector     private authenticationType  Basic Not used yet     private languageID  enUS     private protocol  http     private sessionIdKey  sessionId     private interactionIdKey  interactionIdKey     private maxLoginAttempts  3     private loginAttempts  0     private debug  false      No need to edit beyond this line     private isSubscribledToQueue  false     private alternateHostList  array     private interactionId  0      private queueType  1     private userID     private password     private workstation     private queueName     private cainfo     private baseURL     private csrfToken     private sessionId     private ININICWSCSRFToken     private Location     private subscriptionId     private curlHeader     private requestFile      public function constructconfig               Make sure cURL is enabled on the server         ifiscallablecurlinit             throw new ApiExceptioncURL is disabled on this server.

Negative 80988 pQuestion p  pYoure given a string S of N characters. Its known that the string consists of lowercase latin letters. The string is generated randomly. That means that every symbol is chosen randomly and independently from others from the set a, b, ..., z. All the letters has equal probability to appear.p  pYoure given Q queries on this string. Each query is of the form P C, where P is an integer between 1 and N both inclusive and C is a character from the set a, b, ..., z. Both P and C were chosen at random and independently from other queries.p  pWhen you have a query of the form P C you have to change the Pth symbol of S to C. After every change we ask you to output the number of distinct nonempty substrings of S.p  pInput Format  The first line of input consists of two single space separated integers N and Q  the length of the string S and the number of queries respectively.p  pThe second line contains the string S itself.p  pThe following Q lines describe the queries in the form P C, where P and C are also separated with a single space.p  pConstraintsp  p4  N  75000  4  Q  75000p  pOutput Format  Output Q lines.

I need to do emotion classification for which they say, If you want to do emotion classification instead of gender classification, all you need to do is to update is your training data and the configuration you pass to the demo . I used a dataset with 16 images each for happy and sad emotions. Happy dataset includes faces of happy men,women,kids and elders. Similarly sad dataset as well. But when I tested this on 4 images all 4 went wrong. What other changes should I do apart from the dataset as said in the link by, configurations you pass to the demo. What configurations should I change from the gender classification example facerecfisherfaces.cpp I am new to OpenCV. Please help.p

Negative 80988 pHow to delete cookies in ASP.NET after changing machine key but staying on the same subdomain p  pCurrently we have cookies on example.domain.com, but we need to move to wildcard cookies .domain.com so that the cookie also work on foo.domain.com. In order to do this, we have manually set a machine key to encryptdecrypt the asp.net login cookie. Problem is that people that already have the old cookie, will now receive a CryptographicException when trying to access the site as it tries for some reason to decrypt the old cookie. We have changed the name of the cookie, but it did not help  still receives the error. So we figured out that we wanted to delete all the old cookies. We try do do this on the login site with the following codep  precodevar myCookies  Request.Cookies.AllKeys foreach var cookieName in myCookies      var cookie  Request.Cookies[cookieName]     if cookie  null continue     cookie.Value  written   DateTime.Now     cookie.Expires  DateTime.Now.AddYears1     cookie.Domain  example.domain.com     Response.Cookies.Addcookie  codepre  pWe reach the code, and it runs, but the cookies still remain when inspecting in google chrome resources. So obviously the deletion did not work. We have tried several different ways adding path , setting cookie.Value to cookie.Value etc. For some strange reason the cookies still remain and we are unavailable to delete them. p  pSo to get back to the original question, how an we delete cookies in ASP.NET MVC 4.5 after changing to a wildcard domain on our cookies and explcitly stating the machine key in the web.config p

Then I found the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.linq.expressions.expressionvisitorvvs.110.aspx relnofollowExpressionVisitora. It looks better, but its still a lot of work to override the visitor methods and Id like to know if theres an other option, using perhaps a more specialised framework, before I devote my time to this. p

Negative 80988 pId like to be able to add listeners to active elements as specified in a setup file. The setup file might be something like thisp  precodeltlistenersgt     ltlistenergt         ltfieldgtidltfieldgt         ltmatchgtbuttonltmatchgt         ltusinggtregexpltusinggt         ltexcludesgt             ltexcludegtbuttonyesltexcludegt             ltexcludegtbuttonnoltexcludegt             ltexcludegtbuttoncancelltexcludegt         ltexcludesgt         lteventgtclicklteventgt         ltactiongtonButtonClickltactiongt     ltlistenergt     ltlistenergt...ltlistenergt ltlistenersgt codepre  pWhich means any element with an id matching codebuttoncode, except codebuttonyescode, codenocode and codecancelcode, will call codeonButtonClickcode when a codeclickcode event is triggered.p  pIt doesnt necessarily have to be a builtin event, can be custom, like codefileSystemExceptioncode, or codeuserTimedOutcode. So an event can be fired somewhere in the code and all the elements listening to it will have the respective actions invoked.p  pIdeally, would like to load the setup file very early before any elements are created, and be able to have a listener added even to an element created at runtime. So for example a new element with ID codebuttonrejectcode, created on the fly, which fulfills the criteria, will get the listener. So I guess it has to extend a low level creation methodp  pHas anything like this been done in ExtJS Say by extending one or more base classesp

Negative 80988 pI stumbled uppon the same problem like in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions29613795neo4jrelationshipbetweenthreenodesneo4j  Relationship between three nodesa. I am new in Neo4J and wanted to model a relational database as a graph.p  pI have three types of data, A, B and C. An instance of B, B1, can belong to an instance of C, C1, and an instance of A, A1 can belong to B1 and C1, but if and only if B1 belongs to C1. The problem here is that, i can also have A1  belonging to B2 which belongs to C1 and A1 also belonging to B1 which belongs to C2. These would be three legit, separate combinations. So, in my DB, i would have a join table where in a record i would keep the combination of the three ids, expressing the relationships formed by the instances.p  pNow, from what i can figure, hyperedges is something like what i am searchinga hrefhttpneo4j.comdocsstablecyphercookbookhyperedges.html relnofollowhttpneo4j.comdocsstablecyphercookbookhyperedges.htmla.

So, if i wanted all type C instances that A1 belongs to, i could have the results back with one hop. The relationship traversals would be less in number than the triple type nodes that would have to be visited. I think basically i am asking how Neo4j is looking for patterns internallyWhere does it start, does it reexamine nodes etc. Because i am guessingmaybe wrongfully if i want the Cs that A1 belongs to, i would write something likep  pmatch A1[PARTOF]triplelt[PARTOF]C  return Cp  pHow would that query work First retrieve all triples A1 is part of, then those all C types are part of and finally return the matchesp  pAny hints Thanks in advance.p

Other times, a classs designated initializer may be an overridden version of its superclasss designated initializer.

After hiding some of the Otto registeringunregistering code, it seems as if Espresso is running two tests concurrently The log messages were intertwined for two tests, showing that the fragment was being created for test One then another instance of the fragment was being created for test Two and then the fragment instance for test One was removed followed by the one for test Two.
