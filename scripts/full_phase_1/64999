This is useful, for example, when you have a   portion of the job that can be split into concurrently executable   subtasks.

Positive 64999 pAs a preface, our setup is somewhat unusual due to legacy reasons. It is fully possible that I am going against the grain with this. I would love to get an expert opinion on whether it is possible to get my current setup working or a suggestion on a different approach.p  h2Environmenth2  pJava application with over 10K unit tests in JUnit. For legacy reasons the entire unit test run takes a long time the ultimate goal is to fix the root of the problem, but this will not happen soon.p  pThe application is broken up into multiple modules, with each module having its own unit tests. Executing tests module by module takes a reasonable amount of time, so that if someone commits the code to repo subtree with modules code and only modules tests get executed, they can get a result quickly.p  h2Current Jenkins Setuph2  h3JUnit jobh3  pThis is the single emparameterizedem job that can run tests for any module. The job takes in as parameters the regexs for which tests to run and a parameter indicating which module it is running, for notification purposes. It checks out emthe wholeem repo tree and then does the run based on the parameters.p  pAfter the completion of the run this job does the analysis of JUnits, publishes the report and sends out email notifications.p  h3Repo watchersh3  pOne repo watcher for each module. The watcher checks out only the repo subtree that it wants to monitor. When a change is detected it triggers the JUnit job telling it which tests to run and for what component this is.p  h2Questionh2  pIn general the setup works well, does exactly what I need, however it breaks a few of the nice and expected features of Jenkins and JUnit plugin.p  ol liBecause the same job keeps executing different subsets of unit tests, the job to job comparison between unit tests does not provide any value. Without manually scanning between jobs it is not possible to tell what changed in terms of new failures or new fixes to unit tests.li liSomething very similar happens to change history  Each repo watches runs on its own schedule. Suppose we have a change to module A and a change to module B, very close time wise to each other. If watcher A triggers first, the JUnit job triggered by watcher A will claim both changes. When the JUnit job triggered by watcher B runs, it will not detect any new changes in the repo. This plays havoc with email notifications, as the second JUnit job would not know who broke the build.li ol  pAt the end of the day I believe I am looking for a way to establish dependency relationship between non sequential job runs in Jenkins for the same job, or alternatively a totally different approach.p  pThank youp

Negative 64999 pAs far as I know, only the convenience methods return created objects with an autorelease, so that the receiver is not responsible for the memory of that object. But because Apple says that when you use a method that has a name consisting of new, alloc, create or copy, youre responsible for releasing the object that method returns, I think that these methods should not autorelease these objects. Otherwise they would be convenient and the receiver would not be responsible at all as long as he does not retain the received object. Did I get that rightp

Negative 64999 p[NOTEI am really looking for some good debugging techniques here. Perhaps some tricks or ways to simplify things of which I am unaware.]p  pI am using the technique of calling [WebMethods] defined in an ASPX page from JQuery as mentioned a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions936542callingaspnetwebmethodwithparamsfromjqueryerrorsherea and a hrefhttpencosia.com20080529usingjquerytodirectlycallaspnetajaxpagemethods relnofollowherea. It seems to be an increasingly common method.p  pIve been using it for a while and, in general, it works great. But while developing it is pretty fragile. Any incorrect parameter will result in a really vague, nonspecific, error message. For instance, if I have a fairly complex web method defined asp  precode[WebMethod] public static string SaveComplexRecordint recID, GeneralData general, SomeObject data, SomeOtherObject moreData     do a bunch of stuff with that data  codepre  pAnd GeneralData, SomeObject, and SomeOtherObject all have a mix of various types of parameters strings, ints, bools, datetimes. It is very likely, especially during initial development, that I will build the JSON on the client side incorrectly. Perhaps I will do thisp  precodevar data       recID curID,     general              a aValue,         b bValue,         c cValue     ,     data              d dValue,         e eValue,         f fValue     ,     moredata              g gValue,         h hValue,         i iValue       codepre  pWhich will result in an error because the name of the third parameter is moreData, not moredata. And thats just an example, there could be any of a hundred other subtle typostyle errors. p  pIf I were calling this method from C the compiler would give me an error message something like No overloaded method of SaveComplexRecord takes three parameters. or some other helpful message that points you in the right direction.p  pSo... is there a way of getting ASP.Net to produce better error messages herep  pOr is there some utility that will automatically build the JSON parameter structure of a [WebMethod] call just like you can automatically get the WSDL of a web servicep  p...or any other technique that I may be missingp  pAnd for completeness here is how I call these WebMethods from JQueryp  precode   var jsondata  .toJSONdata      .ajax         type POST,         url MyWebPage.aspxSaveComplexRecord,         data jsondata,         contentType applicationjson charsetutf8,         dataType json,         beforeSend functionxhr                      xhr.setRequestHeaderContenttype,                          applicationjson charsetutf8         ,         success functionmsg                      do something on success         ,         error functionXMLHttpRequest, textStatus, errorThrown                      alertERROR status  textStatus   error  errorThrown                codepre

Hence, this being in the else clause.p  pI also tried putting the balance code where R Samuel Klatchko suggested, but checked the balance on each insert. For example If one inserts 7, 9, 5, 3, and 1 consecutively, I get a null pointer exception when trying to insert 1.p  pEDIT One reason for the above may have something to do with the way I was doing the height.

But, when I tried to start the service in the Microsoft Management Console, the service immediately stops after being started. p  pSo I began investigating what could exactly be causing this issue an came up with this error from the Application Log in the Event Viewer. p  pDescription p  blockquote   pService cannot be started.   System.InvalidOperationException   Service Service has zero application   noninfrastructure endpoints. This   might be because no configuration file   was found for your application, or   because no service element matching   the service name could be found in the   configuration file, or because no   endpoints were defined in the service   element.p blockquote  pThis error is actually generated in the codeOnStartcode of my exe, when I perform this call codeServiceHost.Opencode. Ive seen numerous posts where other individuals have run into this issue, however most if not all of them, claim that the service name or contract namespace and class name, are not being specified. I checked both of these entries in my config file in the exe as well as in the dll, and they match up PERFECTLY. Ive had other people in the office double check behind me to make sure I wasnt going blind at one point, but of course they came to the same conclusion as me that everything looked like it was specified correctly. I am truly at a lost as to what is going on at this point.  Could anyone help me with this issue p  pAnother thing that came up as a possible reason this may be happening is that the app.config is never being read at least not the one I think should be getting read. Could this be the issue If so, how can I go about addressing this issue. Again, ANY help would be appreciated. p

As it could take a while for them to upload everything and we want them to be able to see their uploaded changes pretty much straight away, we thought a thread per agent would be a good idea as no agent then needs to wait for someone else to finish and we have multiple processors so wanted to use their full capacity.

Negative 64999 pTwo quick questions I hope... with the following code.  The script below checks if a number is prime, and if not, returns all the factors for that number, otherwise it just returns that the number prime.  Pay no attention to the zs. stuff in the script, for that is client specific and has no bearing on script functionality.  p  pThe script itself works almost wonderfully, except for two minor details  the first being the factor list doesnt return itself sorted... that is, for 24, itd return 1, 2, 12, 3, 8, 4, 6, and 24 instead of 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.  I cant print it as a table, so it does need to be returned as a list.  If it has to be sorted as a table first THEN turned into a list, I can deal with that.  All that matters is the end result being the list.  p  pThe other detail is that I need to check if there are only two numbers in the list or more.

Negative 64999 pCouchdb is great at storing and serving data, but Im having some trouble getting to grips with how to do backend processing with it. GWT, for example, has out of the box support for synchronous and asynchronous call backs, which allow you to run arbitrary Java code on the server. Is there any way to do something like this with couchdbp  pFor example, Id like to generate and serve a PDF file when the user clicks a button a web app. Ideally the workflow would look something like thisp  ul liUser enters some datali liUser clicks a generate buttonli liA call is made to the server, and the PDF is generated server side. The server code can be written in any language, but preferably Java.li liWhen PDF generation is finished, the user is prompted to download and save the document.li ul  pIs there a way to do this with out of the box couchdb, or is some additional, thirdparty software required to communicate between the web client and backend data processing codep  pEDITLooks like I did a pretty poor job of explaining my question. What Im interested in is essentially serving servlets from Couchdb similarly to the way that you can serve Java servlets along side web pages from a war file. I used GWT as an example because it has support for developing the servlets and client side code together and compiling everything into a single war file. Id be very interested in something like this because it would make deploying fully functional websites a breeze through Couchdb replication.p  pBy the looks of it, however, the answer to my question is no, you cant serve servlets from couchdb. The database is set up for CRUD style interactions, and any servlet style components need to either be served separately, or done by polling the db for changes and acting accordingly.p

Negative 64999 pSSISp  pHello. p  pFirstly excuse me if this doesnt make a lot of sense as Im fairly as in 2 days ago new to SSIS.p  pUltimately Im looking to import all data from an XML file and depending on what kind of file it is process in a different way and load to a set of relational tables in a Microsoft SQL Server 2008. p  pEach XML file has a Boolean flag of 0 or 1. Depending on if its 0 or 1 I would like the data flow to go a different way as each type of file needs to be processed differently. p  pIve been looking at using the conditional split transformation however Ive come across a couple of issues. p  pI get the data using a dataflow XML source and check the flag then depending on if its 0 or 1 the data flows left or right. However the XML contains lots of data and I can only move the data element with the flag and I need it to move the rest of the data in that direction as well.p  pI thought I might open the file check the flag, store the flag as a variable then close the file and open a 0 package or a 1 package depending on the variable which would then open the xml file again and pull out the data. However this doesnt smell right as Im opening and closing the same XML file twice. p  pHas anyone else come across this and how did they get around it  p
Negative 64999 pI have implemented a simple scrollable photogallery with jQuery Tools.br I then attached the autoscroll behavior to the jQuery tools scroller to create a photo slideshow.br Then I attached the jQuery colorbox to the photo slideshow to provide a larger version of the images.  p  pIm running into the following problems.  I hope I can explain them with the best possible way since the behavior sometimes is unpredictable.  p  pThe major issue is that when I stop the slideshow and click on the image to bring the colorbox or the nextprevious buttons the slideshow starts again. Is there a way to disable this behaviorp  pAnother problem is that when I click on the colorbox it looks like there are 9 images instead of 7. You can see that by clicking on a photo and seeing the index that colorbox generates on the top right of the zoomed version of the photo.br Why is this happening I cannot find an explanation.  p  pFinally the most annoying part of all which has happened twice and I cannot reproduce is that jQuery tools scrollable at some point when you open and close colorbox it messes up the indexes and scrolls an additional step resulting into a blank nonexistent photo .. this also messes up the display of the current photo number which is on the bottom left  the navigation.  p  pI know that those two libraries are not necessarily meant to work together however I posted these questions here in case someone has done the same or a relative script.br Any help would be verry much appreciated.p  pJavascript code  p  precodegallery.scrollablecirculartrue.autoscrollautoplaytrue var api  gallery.datascrollable var indd  api.getIndex  api.onSeekfunction      curp.htmlparseIntapi.getIndex1     totp.htmlapi.getSize   slid.togglefunction          api.stop         this.htmlSLIDESHOW ON         return false     , function          api.play         this.htmlSLIDESHOW OFF         return false         curp.htmlparseIntapi.getIndex1 totp.htmlapi.getSize  a[relcolorbox].colorbox codepre  pemstrongem UPDATE ememstrong Up to now I have managed to figure out one of the strange behaviors.br Colorbox shows more total images than there are.

Negative 64999 pI got a VS10 project. I want to build some C code so I can use it in python. I followed the boost tutorial and got it working.

Negative 64999 pIm trying to find a way for my program to know when a WebBrowser is navigating and when is not. This is because the program will interact with the loaded document via JavaScript that will be injected in the document. I dont have any other way to know when it starts navigating than handling the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.forms.webbrowser.navigating.aspx relnofollowNavigatinga event since is not my program but the user who will navigate by interacting with the document. But then, when codeDocumentCompletedcode occurs doesnt necessarily mean that it have finished navigating. Ive been googling a lot and found two pseudosolutionsp  ol lipCheck for WebBrowsers a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.forms.webbrowser.readystate.aspx relnofollowReadyStatea property in the codeDocumentCompletedcode event. The problem with this is that if not the document but a frame in the document loads, the codeReadyStatecode will be codeCompletedcode even if the main document is not completed.pli lipTo prevent this, they advise to see if the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.forms.webbrowserdocumentcompletedeventargs.url.aspx relnofollowUrla parameter passed to codeDocumentCompletedcode matches the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.forms.webbrowser.url.aspx relnofollowUrla of the codeWebBrowsercode. This way I would know that codeDocumentCompletedcode is not being invoked by some other frame in the document.pli ol  pThe problem with 2 is that, as I said, the only way I have to know when a page is navigating is by handling the codeNavigatingcode or codeNavigatedcode event. So if, for instance, Im in Google Maps and click Search, codeNavigatingcode will be called, but just a frame is navigating not the whole page on the specific Google case, I could use the codeTargetFrameNamecode property of codeWebBrowserNavigatingEventArgscode to check if its a frame the one that is navigating, but frames doesnt always have names. So after that, codeDocumentCompletedcode will be called, but not with the same codeUrlcode as my codeWebBrowsercodes codeUrlcode property because it was just a frame the one that navigated, so my program would thing that its still navigating, forever.p  pAdding up calls to codeNavigatingcode and subtracting calls to codeDocumentCompletedcode wont work either. They are not always the same. I havent find a solution to this problem for months already Ive been using solutions 1 and 2 and hoping they will work for most cases. My plan was to use a timer in case some web page has errors or something but I dont think Google Maps has any errors.

However, in these cases the python philosophy is to offer a cloning method on the mutable object, so you can bind a copy rather than the original. pli ol  pSo I guess the answer is that there is no assignment in python, the best way to mimic it would be binding to a cloned objectp  pI simply wanted to share the question in case Im missing something important herep  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrong p  pBoth Lie Ryan and Sven Marnach answers are good, I guess the overall answer is a mix of both p  pFor user defined types, use the idiom p  blockquote   pa.strongdictstrong  dictb.strongdictstrongp blockquote  pI guess this has problems as well if the assigned class has redefined attribute access methods, but lets not be fussy p  pFor mutable builtins lists and dicts use the cloning  copying methods they provide eg slices, updatep  pfinally inmutable builtins cant be changed so cant be assignedp  pIll choose Lie Ryan because its an elegant idiom that I hadnt thought of.p  pThanksp

I then will have a folder where I will upload a still from the video, the video itself and the title and description in different files. I then want each div to go into this folder and select the last uploaded files and display them. You will then be able to click on the div and it will open up another page with the title, description and video. I have been searching around but think that my request is too specific to try and find an answer. Im guessing that I will need to use php somewhere along the way such as selecting the folder and getting the last uploaded files but am unsure what else and even how to build everything else. Id be grateful of any information you could give.p

Negative 64999 pThe Less gem has been superseded by less.js, which runs on the server with Node.js. More, the official Less plugin for Rails, hasnt been updated since June 14, 2010.p  pIn light of all that, what is the recommended way to use Less with Rails these days I suppose I could always just use clientside JS for this, which everyone seems to be embracing. But Im not crazy about relying on clientside JS just to transform a stylesheet, especially considering that Id like to degrade gracefully. I realize that Less.js is considered very fast, but as a matter of principle, I dont want my CSS to be utterly dependent on the browsers JS engine.p  pAssuming I want to compile Less serverside, what is the best practice these days for use with Rails I know you can run Less using Node.js, but Im looking for nice Rails integration such as we once had with More.p  pIm looking for something that will work on Linux and Mac.

If the pending changes counter is zero there is no need to commit to the index, reopen codeIndexReadercode, codeIndexSearchercode and so on. Also we have some application level logic that is linked to codeIndexReader.commitcode call and its better not to call it if there is no actual changes in commit point.p  pI have access to all the places where methods codeIndexReader.updateDocumentcode and codeIndexReader.removecode are called, so I simply can write my own counter of pending changes. But Im intrested may be there is already exists one in the Lucene API itself API check doesnt give me enough information on the topic.p

Negative 64999 pI have an iPhone app and an iPad app which have an identical code base other than the xib files being different for each platform.  In the app delegate of each app, I have NOT overridden the applicationDidEnterBackground method.p  pWhen I run the iPad application, then press the home button, if I touch the application icon the app comes up right where it left off same screen, etc.p  pWhen I run the iPhone application, then press the home button, if I touch the application icon the app will start up as if it were not running.p  pBoth show to be running if you doubleclick the home button before touching the application icon again.

Negative 64999 pWe are having issue with displaying Speed which is part of Description that comes with CoreLocation working on Ios Simulator for Iphone. In the view controller, we connect the Description to label. It does display most of information such as lat and long, time. We can verify that the lat and long, and time displayed change when we move from one location to another. However, the speed is either 1 when we are not moving or 0 when we are moving. p  pHow we test it We use ios simulator that comes with XCODE 4 and connect to 3G internet connection and drive around the town. We can also verify that the information displayed refreshes every minute.p  pQuestions  does Ios Simulator support the Speed display from CoreLocation  does corelocation work only on certain type of internet connection wifi, airport  do we have to deploy the app into iphone to get Speed displayed properlyp
Negative 64999 pI am new to android development and have been trying to create some basic apps to get used to the platform. I have a basic app that allows a user to input words with definitions. The main view is a listview that is populated by an ArrayAdapter which is fed from an ArrayList. When the user chooses to add a word they can input a name and definition, and if that name is not already in the list it is added to the list. The name and definition are then put into a Word object custom object that implements a linked list to reference all words that have been input. This part of the program works fine, I am able to add as many words as I want, the problem is with the saving. I have a reference to the root of my linked list of word objects in an object called wordlist this object also holds the ArrayList. I have implemented Serializeable with all of my objects and my plan was to save the entire wordlist object each time a word is added. To do this I implemented the following in my AddWord activity the activity called when the user chooses to add a wordp  precodetry                                                  FileOutputStream fileOut  openFileOutputwords.obj, Context.MODEPRIVATE     ObjectOutputStream objectOut  new ObjectOutputStreamfileOut     objectOut.writeObjectActivityMain.wordlist     objectOut.close     fileOut.close   catch IOException e       Context context  getApplicationContext     CharSequence text  File Error     int duration  Toast.LENGTHSHORT     Toast toast  Toast.makeTextcontext, text, duration     toast.show  codepre  pNow this code does seem to work for the most part, I am able to save and load my words without any problems until for some reason the 22nd word I try to add force closes the program. Then when I try to open it again it will force close as soon as it pops up. This is also weird to me because I have a try catch statement in the onCreate method of the starting activity that should catch any problem with the file and simply recreate the objectp  precodetry              FileInputStream fileIn  this.openFileInputwords.obj             ObjectInputStream objectIn  new ObjectInputStreamfileIn             wordlist  Words objectIn.readObject             objectIn.close             fileIn.close  catch Exception e      wordlist  new Words  codepre  pIf I go into my applications on my phone and clear the data it is able to start back up. I could not find anyone who had a similar problem as far as I could tell. I did try commenting out the file output section and everything works fine, it just wont save. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. In case it is not clear I am trying to save locally to my program.p  pMy development environment Windows 7 64bit, Eclipse 64bit, Java 64bit I know some people have had problems with 64bit Java and Eclipse, but I have been able to develop other Java and Android programs in this environment.

Just trying to clean that up and crossmachine scripting seems like it would work in theory.  Just dont know if the boundaries of crossmachines are even a valid thing.p

Negative 64999 pIve written a working program in Python that basically parses a batch of binary files, extracting data into a data structure. Each file takes around a second to parse, which translates to hours for thousands of files. Ive successfully implemented a threaded version of the batch parsing method with an adjustable number of threads. I tested the method on 100 files with a varying number of threads, timing each run. Here are the results 0 threads refers to my original, prethreading code, 1 threads to the new version run with a single thread spawned.p  precode0 threads 83.842 seconds 1 threads 78.777 seconds 2 threads 105.032 seconds 3 threads 109.965 seconds 4 threads 108.956 seconds 5 threads 109.646 seconds 6 threads 109.520 seconds 7 threads 110.457 seconds 8 threads 111.658 seconds codepre  pThough spawning a thread confers a small performance increase over having the main thread do all the work, increasing the number of threads actually emdecreasesem performance. I would have expected to see performance increases, at least up to four threads one for each of my machines cores. I know threads have associated overhead, but I didnt think this would matter so much with singledigit numbers of threads.p  pIve heard of the global interpreter lock, but as I move up to four threads I do see the corresponding number of cores at workwith two threads two cores show activity during parsing, and so on.p  pI also tested some different versions of the parsing code to see if my program is IO bound. It doesnt seem to be just reading in the file takes a relatively small proportion of time processing the file is almost all of it. If I dont do the IO and process an alreadyread version of a file, I adding a second thread damages performance and a third thread improves it slightly. Im just wondering why I cant take advantage of my computers multiple cores to speed things up. Please post any questions or ways I could clarify.p

Negative 64999 pIm pretty new to managedunmanaged interop, so Im looking to get some opinions on how safe the following procedure is for getting a bitmap from unmanaged C to managed C. The basic idea isp  ol liC calls an interop function, codeFetchImagecode, which is in the unmanaged C. It passes an codeout intcode param. codeFetchImagecode has a corresponding codelong code param.li liIn C, codeFetchImagecode creates a codeCBitmapcode somewhere safe, ie not local, draws something on it, uses codeHandleToLongcode to convert the bitmaps codeHBITMAPcode handle to a codelongcode, stores it in the param for the C, and returns.li liBack in C, the codeout intcode param is converted to an codeIntPtrcode and uses codeSystem.Drawing.Image.FromHbitmapcode to copy the data and produce a codeSystem.Drawing.Bitmapcode object.li liC then calls another interop function, codeReleaseImagecode.li liIn C, codeReleaseImagecode frees the resources associated with the codeCBitmapcode it created earlier.li ol  pThats the gist for the impatient. More specific code examples below.p  pC interop definitions for the functionsp  precodenamespace      stduniqueptrlt CBitmap gt bitty  HRESULT stdcall HelperFetchImage [out] long  hBitmap       bitty.reset new CBitmap        call CreateBitmap and then draw something,      ensure its not selected into a DC when done      hBitmap  HandleToLong bittygtGetSafeHandle      return SOK  HRESULT stdcall HelperReleaseImage      bitty.reset     return SOK  codepre  pIDL prototypes for the interop functions, which are wrapped in a helper class in Cp  precode[id1] HRESULT FetchImage long  hBitmap  [id2] HRESULT ReleaseImage codepre  pProduces these C prototypes in the helper classp  precodevoid FetchImage out int hBitmap  void ReleaseImage codepre  pAnd the C that calls them looks kind of like thisp  precodeint ret helper.FetchImage out ret  Bitmap b  Image.FromHbitmap IntPtrret  helper.ReleaseImage  do anything I want with b codepre  pThe only issue Ive come up with on my own is the case of a call to codeFetchImagecode or codeReleaseImagecode from somewhere else getting things out of sync. So Ill probably have a list of codeCBitmapcodes instead of just one, then pass the handle back to codeReleaseImagecode so itll only destroy the one from the matching codeFetchImagecode call.p  pAre there any gotchas Im not aware of I do have this working, I just wanted to make sure Im not doing something dangerous because I dont know any better.p

Negative 64999 pI want to know should I specify gem version for each gem I add to Gemfile or not. Earlier with few of my projects I didnt specified any versions for all the gems and bundler took care of it, which worked quite well as well.p  pBut recently I got to work on few project which were under development for last 6 month. In that project, many of gem versions were specified in Gemfile only and Gemfile.lock was ignored. That caused a lot headache to finally resolve version conflicts and upgrade few gems.p  pAlso got to know that its bad practice to remove Gemfile.lock from application version control  nice article by yehuda  a hrefhttpyehudakatz.com20101216clarifyingtherolesofthegemspecandgemfilehttpyehudakatz.com20101216clarifyingtherolesofthegemspecandgemfileap  pSo, my question is should I specify version for each and every gem I specifiy in Gemfile or just specify name and bundler will take care of version  What is best practice to handle this p  pUPDATE  p  pUpdating this question to correctly specify the problem, as a Gemfile sovles many problems p  pProb 1  Every developer should have same version of gems. Actually adding Gemfile.lock into version control solved this problem. Developers just have to take care that they run bundle installbundle rather than bundle update as this will update versions as well.p  pProb 2  Some gems version, if changed, brakes application code. Actually with omniauth,there are this type of issues, as API are changed from one version to another. And yes, to keep application working, versions will need to be specified for this gems.p  pMy Prob.  So, in my gemfile, as versions for both A and B are strictly specified, and as they both depend on different versions of Z, which is there dependency, I even cant run the bundle install or bundle update. The only solution was to remove versions and let bundler to take the call. Thats why I had question like   Gemfile.versionspecificationmandatory  truefalsep

Negative 64999 pIm developing an Android app. When the user pushes a button, I wanna add the unique identifier of the Android device and some other data to a database.p  pThe problem is How can I prevent that other applications  websites etc. can put data into my database.p  pI was thinking about a SSL connection, but also other apps could use a SSL connection to connect to my database. The next what came up in my mind was creation an extra field, use a salt and encrypt the unique id  other data  salt and check on the db server if the encrypted information matches.p  pBut in theory is it possible to reverse engineer an Android app, so they could find my salt and also send the encrypted information to my db.p  pHow can I make a php script to save information into a db, and make it only usable for just my own applicationp

Negative 64999 pIm a physicist, and have been learning some programming, and have come across a lot of people using quaternions for rotations instead of writing things in matrixvector form. p  pIn physics, there are very good reasons we dont use quaternions despite the bizarre story thats occasionally told about HamiltonGibbsetc. Physics requires that our descriptions have good analytic behavior this has a precisely defined meaning, but in some rather technical ways that go far beyond whats taught in normal intro classes, so I wont go into any detail. It turns out that quaternions dont have this nice behavior, and so they arent useful, and vectorsmatrices do, so we use them.p  pHowever, restricted to rigid rotations and descriptions that do not use any analytic structures, 3D rotations can be equivalently described either way or a few other ways.p  pGenerally, we just want a mapping of a point Xx,y,z to a new point Xx,y,z subject to the constraint that X2  X2. And there are lots of things that do this. p  pThe naive way is to just draw the triangles this defines and use trig, or use the isomorphism between a point x,y,z and a vector x,y,z and the function fX  X and a matrix MXX, or using quaternions, or projecting out components of the old vector along the new one using some other method x, y, zT.a,b,c x,y,z, etc, etc.p  pFrom a math point of view, these descriptions are all equivalent in this setting as a theorem. They all have the same number of degrees of freedom, the same number of constraints, etc.p  pSo why do quaternions seem to preferred over vectorsp  pThe usual reasons I see are no gimbal lock, or numerical issues.p  pThe no gimbal lock argument seems odd, since this is only a problem of euler angles. It is also only a coordinate problem just like the singularity at r0 in polar coordinates the Jacobian looses rank, which means it is only a local problem, and can be resolved by switching coordinates, rotating out of the degeneracy, or using two overlapping coordinate systems. p  pIm less sure about numerical issues, since I dont know in detail how both of these and any alternatives would be implemented. Ive read that renormalizing a quaternion is easier than doing that for a rotation matrix, but this is only true for a general matrix a rotation has additional constraints that trivializes this which are built into the definition of quaternions In fact, this has to be true since they have the same number of degrees of freedom. p  pSo what is the reason for the use of quaternions over vectors or other alternatives p

Negative 64999 pWe are developing a small c server application. The server application does some data processing and responds back to the client. To keep the data processing part configurable and flexible we decided to go for scripting and based on the availability of various ready modules we decided to go for Python. We are using the PythonC api to sendreceive the data between c and python.p  pstrongThe Algorithm works something like thisstrongp  ol liServer receives some data from client, this data is stored in a dictionary created in c. The dictionary is created using the api function PyDictNew from c. The input is stored as a key value pair in the dictionary using the api function PyDictSetItemStringli liNext, we execute the python script PyRunSimpleString passing the script as a parameter. This script makes use of the dictionary created in c. Please note, we make the dictionary created in c, accessible to the script using the methods PyImportAddModule and PyModuleAddObjectli liWe store the result of the data processing in the script as a key value pair in the same dictionary created above. The c code can then simply access the result variablekeyvalue pair after the script has executed.li ol  pstrongThe problemstrong The problem we are facing is in the case of concurrent requests coming in from different clients. When multiple requests come in from different clients we tend to object reference count exceptions. Please note, that for each request which comes in for a user, we create an independent dictionary for that user alone. To overcome this problem we encompassed the call to PyRunSimpleString within PyEvalAcquireLock and PyEvalReleaseLock, but doing this has resulted in the script execution being a blocking call. So if a script is taking long time to execute, all the other users are also waiting for a response.p  pCould you please suggest the best possible approach or give pointers to where we are going wrong. Please ping me for more information.p  pAny helpguidance will be appreciated.p

Negative 64999 pIve got a UIToolbar at the top of my iPad apps main screen. It has 6 UIBarButtonItems on it. 4 of these items trigger UIPopOvers to appear. The other 2 items either switch to a different view or change something about the current view.p  p3 of the 4 UIPopOvers appear from the tapped UIBarButtonItem, the 4th appears without an arrow in the middle of the screen.p  pI would like the following functionality, but am having difficulty getting to itp  ol liWhen no UIPopOvers are displayed and a user taps one of the UIBarButtonItems that generates a UIPopOver, show that UIPopOver pretty simple got this working.li liWhen a UIPopOver is displayed and a user taps the UIToolbar, dismiss that UIPopOver.

Negative 64999 pI am a composer by profession and my computer science skills are limited though I program quite a bit of the software that I use.p  pWhat are the most reasonable ways to approach SQLite integration as a file format and database in an iOS app it also needs to run on windows, but that is a secondary concernp  pI have been researching Hiberlite, which looks fantastic, but it seems to be little used and apparently it doesnt run well on embedded systems iOS and chokes up when thousands of objects are in play. I havent been able to get a sense of how severe those bottle necks are when running under those conditions.p  pThe settings of thousands of objects 50,000 though that number could expand would be read every 110 seconds and written periodically.  Read performance is more critical as write operations can stutter with out effecting the core operation of the app.p  pGiven those conditions, how should I approach SQLite  My understanding is that without something like Hiberlite the entire database many millions of entries must be read and rewritten for every entry, is that less efficient.  If that is the best approach is there a good resource to follow for implementing itp  pAny advice would be greatly appreciated.  My current software that I rely on is beyond buggy and needs refactoring, but due to my inexperience I am having a difficult time finding information about a reasonable approach.p  pThanks, Caseyp

Negative 64999 pThe differences between a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavalangStringBuilder.html relnofollowcodeStringBuildercodea and a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase6docsapijavalangStringBuffer.html relnofollowcodeStringBuffercodea in Java are well documented and have been a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq355089507519touched upon in StackOverflowa as well.p  pBasically, codeStringBuildercode is a nonsynchronized copy of codeStringBuffercode, with pretty much the same interface since it was intended as a faster dropin replacement for codeStringBuffercode. Their API is practically identical and they are actually subclasses of the same eminaccessibleem abstract class in the current JDK.p  pThe one thing I wonder about, therefore, is why they are not empublicly relatedem. Having both classes implement a common interface or even having codeStringBuffercode as a subclass of codeStringBuildercode would make sense, allowing the existence of shared code for both classes.p  pSo why this forced separation Was it so that programmers would not inadvertently mix threadsafe with threadunsafe code Or was it just a design oversight that will now be inherited to the end of eternityp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pTo make things clear I can emspeculateem on why things are like this, but I am hoping for concrete references to an actual decision, e.g. during a JSR process.

The flip side   is that by adding a common supertype, wed be taking the errors of our   past and enshrining them in a public interface to be with us for all   time.

I positioned it absolutely and not relatively because then I ended up with a gap at the bottom of my page where the content div still takes up its original space on the page.p  pBehind and underneath that content div, with a slight overlap, I want another div. Since the content div is absolutely positioned and of variable height, I cant relatively or absolutely position my bottom div. So Im planning to use javascriptjquery to get the height of my content div and position the bottombehind div relative to it on the page using absolute positioning.p  pIs that bad practise, or is that the right thing to dop  pThank youp  pEdit I would assume this is an objective answer, either it is the right way to do things or not...p

Negative 64999 pI am working on a project implementing a DotSpatial tabribbon application. Each tab is a plugin. When the project is saved, a RaiseSaveRequest event handler creates a dictionary that is passed to each plugins projectSavedListener through e. Then within the listener, e.dictPackedStates.addspluginName, PackState, which goes to each plugins PackState, packes itself up into a dictionary. So, the whole applications state is saved in the dictPackedStates dictionary as  of pluginName, dictionary of each plugin.p  pI am using JSON.NET to serializedeserialize the file when its savedopened.I think my save is working fine. p  precodeDictionaryltstring, objectgt pluginStates  new Dictionaryltstring, objectgt signaller.RaiseSaveRequestpluginStates  JSON string json  JsonConvert.SerializeObjectpluginStates StreamWriter sw  new StreamWriterstrPathName  sw.Writejson sw.Close codepre  pMy sw.Writejson seems to be writing the JSON to the file.

I would prefer a solution that maps using Objects in stead of loose ids. I tried the following but of course it didnt work, but I think it gives an idea of what I would like to achievep  precodeEntity public class Bar      Id     Columnname  id     private int id      OneToMany     private SetltFoogt foo   Entity public class Foo      EmbeddedId     private FooPK key      MapsIdbarId     ManyToOne     JoinColumnname  barid, referencedColumnName  id     AccessAccessType.FIELD     private Bar getBar              return key.getBar        Embeddable public class FooPK      Columnname  id     private int id      Transient     private Bar bar      ....      Columnname  barid     AccessAccessType.PROPERTY     private int getBarId              return bar.getId       codepre  pAnother problem with the latter solution is that the codegetBarIdcode method in codeFooPKcode needs to have a codesetBarIdIntcode method. Setting the Object using the ID can be done by accessing the data access layer, however this in my opinion violates the separation of businessdomaindata layers.p  pSo what to do Go with the first solution and keep the ids in sync manually or is there another best practicep

There is one admin at the top with 2 users under him each with 3 users under them and there is a group of 50 records in an Oracle database table. Each record has a field for readaccess and write access.p  pAt the start the admin has all read access and write access. There are 2 sheets in the excel spreadsheet, a read only and a write sheet. Each is populated with the relevant records from the database. The admin should be able to edit the read access and write access fields to a different user name, save the changes, and when that user opens the excel sheet they should only see those records associated with them.p  pBasically can I automate this What I want to happen is that when the user opens the excel sheet the excel sheet gets the records associated with them and then they can editread as they see fit.p

Negative 64999 pI have quite a few static files used in my Google App Engine application CSS, robots.txt, etc. They are all defined in app.yaml.p  pI want to have some automated tests that check whether those definitions in app.yaml are valid and my latest changes didnt brake anything. E.g. check that specific URLs return correct responses. Ideally, it should be a part of my app unit tests.p

Negative 64999 pas cliche as it sounds, long time reader, first time poster. Im currently helping a family member out with some work and he has to sort through several thousand records and slightly change the format, obviously without some sort of automation it would take tens of hours and he asked me if I could help do it quickly. At first I thought I could, but Im a little over my head with some of this stuff.p  pBasically, he has this data in this type of formatp  pre Sample No  1         Ag 20 1         Au 50 1         Cu 80 2         AG 1 2         Au 30 3         Cu 30 pre  pBut we need the data like thisp  pre Sample No. Ag Au Cu 1          20 50 80 2          1  30  3              30 pre  pAt first I thought I could do it with a formula to move the data horizontally.

Negative 64999 pIm deploying an eCommerce site for my customer in spain.

Negative 64999 pI have a small code320x144codeviewcontroller named codeSubViewController.hcode which has a UITableView in it with 3 cells with a single section. I have made the tableView unscrollable and also put some shadow effect behind the tableView by grace of codeCALayercode. p  pIn another viewcontroller named as MainViewController.m i have added codeSubViewController.hcode as a subview to this codeMainViewControllercode. Using codeUIPanGestureRecognizercode i have successfully able to drag the SubViewContoller anywhere i want. p  pI make this subView visible with a codeUIBarButtonItemcode. And after selecting a cell in the tableView of the subview i made it disappear from  main view with some animation.p  pEverything works fine.p  pBut when i drag the subview and then try to select one cell i have to tap the cell twice. In first tap nothing actually happens except the cell turns bluelike it happens normally when you select a cell in tableView but does not go Hidden. If i tap again then it will go hidden.p  pWithout dragging the subview i can select one cell with a single touch and also the view goes hidden.p  pI have written the code for hiding the subview in codedidSelectRowAtIndexPathcode method of the subview. And I have checked this method is not called when i select first time after dragging the subview.In the second tap or touch it is called though. And again if the user moves the subview again same problem occurs.p  pSurely some property of the subview got changed after dragging which i cant able to figure out.p

Negative 64999 pMergesort is a fairly common sorting algorithm, and I have written a working mergesort algorithm. Then I want to optimize it. The first step was to convert it from a recursive to an iterative one, which I did. Then I couldnt discern what else can be optimized. After poring through lots of articles on internet, I got two mechanisms, using strongmultimergestrong sort and strongtiled mergesortstrong. However none of the documents provided any pseudocode, or even cared to explain much on how to do it, and how does it offer the advantages its author says it does, like being cachefriendly and improved locality hit. p  pCan anyone elaborate on this matter, and if possible, provide some pseudocode Specifically, I want to know how to make it cachefriendly.

Negative 64999 pMy codeContextMenucode shows a weird behaviour when opened again, i.e. rightclicking a second time such that the menu closes and openes again at the new position the menu is part of a codeTabControlcode.p  pBasically, when I rightclick the codeTabControlcode the menu opens normally, but if I rightclick again while the menu is already open, the old one disappears and the new one at the new mouse position blinks once before normally opening. It looks like the menu very quickly openes, then closes, and then opens normally.p  pFirst I thought it might have something to do with another event that is raised while clicking the codeTabControlcode, but removing this event did not help.p  pIf anyone wants some code, please ask.

Negative 64999 pIm creating an AngularJS service to validate form inputs and I cant for the life of me figure out how to use JSDoc3 to create reasonable documentation.p  pIdeally I need to export the documentation for the validator service as well as the documentation for each validator internal objects p  pAfter googling around a bit I was able to get it kind of working by hacking around a bit with namespaces, but Im wondering if theres a emrightem way to do this.

Negative 64999 pI have a Visual Studios Solution with two projects, one VB.net the other VC. The VC project is a wrapper around Nvidias Driver API called Nvapi. It is a nvapi.lib file and the associated header files. My code compiles and runs fine on my development machine but I tried copying the whole solution directory to another computer and running the executable it get an error saying the VC project dll or one of its dependences could not be foundloaded. It runs fine until the point that my code uses the nvapi wrapper but then crashes. I tried publishing the project so that it generated an installer and installing the program that way but I get the same error. p  pI decided to install VS2010 on the other computer and see if I could debug the  problem. After installing VS2010 I made a backup copy of the solution folder. I then opened the solution and compiled and ran the code fine. Now this is the part I really dont understand I went to the backed up copy of the solution the one that was compiled on my development machine navigated to the executable and ran it and it now worked fine. The only thing that I can think is that compiling the code copied the Nvapi.lib file to so system directory so that the exe works. Does anyone know what would cause this problem and how I would go about getting my code working on other machines without installing visual studiop

Negative 64999 pI have defined some structure above main asp  precodestruct arguments     int c    char v[]  codepre  pnow I want to do this in mainp  precodeint mainint argc, char argv[]      arguments arg      arg.c  argc     arg.v  argv  error incompatible types in assignment of char to char [0]   codepre  pSo, I do not fully understand what I am doing, but instinctively I remade the structure such that the line codechar v[]code is instead codechar v[]code however, this means when I pass by reference my structure codeargcode, if I want to dereference and get the value of codearg.v[0]code, which will be the program name, I now have to do codearg.v[0]code and this no longer works for codearg.v[1]code.p  pI have a function such asp  precodevoid argumentreaderarguments amparg     cout ltlt Number of arguments  ltlt arg.c ltlt endl ltlt endl    cout ltlt ArrayttValuen    coutbar40    for int i  0 i lt arg.c i           cout ltlt argv[ ltlt i ltlt ]tt ltlt arg.v[i] ltlt endl        return  codepre  pbut when I call codearg.v[i]code the program ends without printing the value of the second argument or any others for that matter.p  pSo my question is,  is there some way I can use the struct to pass between functions such that I can call codearg.v[someindex lt arg.c]code inside another function by somehow making the line codearg.v  argvcode in main work as I had intended to store the address of codeargvcode in codearg.vcodep  pAll the structure does is make it so that instead of having to pass codeargccode and codeargvcode to a function which has a decleration like codevoid funcint ampargc, char argv[]code I can instead pass my new structure type with variable name codeargcode to a function declared like codevoid funcarguments ampargcode and that is basically all I wanted the structure for.

Negative 64999 pSince my a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15747669howtogetthispointerfromstdfunction1574787715747877last recent questiona was unfortunately worded and resulted in a solution to another problem then mine, here I will try to formulate my actual problem in a clear way.p  pBefore we start, as a sidenote, I am integrating the Javascript Engine V8 into my C application. Thats where all the types in the example come from. And thats also the reason for the fact that I need a raw function pointer in the end. But I elaborate on this below.p  pFrom inside a class I need to pass a lambda expression with the capture clause code[]code as parameter of the type codestdfunctioncode to another function and cast it to a raw function pointer there.p  pIn this code, codeInvocationCallbackcode is simply a typedef for a function with the signature codeHandleltValuegtArguments const ampcode.p  precodetypedef HandleltValuegt InvocationCallbackArguments const amp  void Bindstring Name, functionltHandleltValuegtArguments const ampgt Function      InvocationCallback function  Function.targetltInvocationCallbackgt  codepre  pAll the lambda expressions have the same signature, too. Note that codeHandleltStringgtcode is compatible to codeHandleltValuegtcode in this example. Its given by the Javascript Engine V8, too.p  precodeBindname, []const Argumentsamp args gt HandleltValuegt     HandleltStringgt result  StringNewName.cstr     return result  codepre  pC allows me to pass this lambda as codestdfunctioncode to the function above. But I guess a lambda expression also stores a reference to object it refers. Somehow the access specified by code[]code must be realized. That might be the reasons that casting the codestdfunctioncode to a raw function pointer fails.p  precodeInvocationCallback function  Function.targetltInvocationCallbackgt codepre  pThere is neither a compile time error nor a runtime error but the debugger tells me that it results in a null pointer. But I need the raw function pointer for further processing. I guess I could convert the lambda after codestdbindcodeing the reference  or codethiscodepointer first.p  pUpdate Since it seems to be impossible to get the state out of the lambda, this is what I tried. It compiles but codefunctioncode come out to be a null pointer.p  precodeBindname, this, []Base object, const Argumentsamp args gt HandleltValuegt     return v8StringNewDerivedobjectgtName.cstr   void Bindstring Name, Module Object, functionltHandleltValuegtModule, Arguments const ampgt Function      functionltHandleltValuegtArguments const ampgt method  stdbindFunction, Object, stdplaceholders1     InvocationCallback function  method.targetltInvocationCallbackgt   codepre

Negative 64999 pstrongEditstrong I found why. Like i said, i was testing in clojure repl, and generate codeint[]code from clojures codeintarray seqcode function, which takes a lot time to run, and outweights the actual algorithm runtime. All i had measured is how fast codeintarraycode runs. It turns out solution 2 is running Olognm. p  pI want to close this but I cannot find a close link on the page. p  poriginalp  pSo, I was working on a hrefhttpdiscuss.leetcode.comquestions142medianoftwosortedarrays relnofollowthisa finding the median of two sorted array problem from leetcode. Here is the problem descriptionp  blockquote   pThere are two sorted arrays A and B of size m and n respectively. Find   the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity   should be Olog mn.p blockquote  pYou may ignore the solutions given on the page for now, as it is not very relevant to the problem I have. p  pI came up with two solutionsp  pSolution 1 calculate the index of the median if two arrays were merged. Simply run an iteration from 0 up to median  1. Each iteration, you compare two running pointers from both arrays and decide who is ith smallest suppose i and running from 0 to median1. Obviously this merges two sorted array and runs in Onm. p  pSolution 2 The same idea as a hrefhttpaleph.nublogkthsmallestinsortedunion.html relnofollowthisa. Basically in each iterationrecursion, it cuts one of the two arrays in half, by comparing the medians of two arrays. It runs in Olognm.p  pIll paste my code to the end of the post. Be warned it smells. p  pBoth solution are accepted by leetcode online judge. However, I found the runtime of them are more or less similarp  pSo I went and did some tests. It turns out solution 2 always has similar run time as solution 1, despite the size I give them solution 2 seems to have a slightly higher variance. Even worse, run time of solution 2 grows linearly with the size of the array I give it. p  pSo, obviously, my question is why Is it my algorithm or something lower level deciding this behaviorp  pBTW, I run the code in a clojure repl, not sure if that matters.p  pHere is the codep  precodepublic class Solution  public double findMedianSortedArrayslinearint A[], int B[]       Start typing your Java solution below      DO NOT write main function     double resultM  0, resultMPlus  0     int a  0, b  0     int total  A.length  B.length     int m  total  12     forint i  0 i lt m1 i         ifa  A.length ampamp b  B.length             break                  ifb  B.length             ifi  m                 resultM  A[a]                          ifi  m1                 resultMPlus  A[a]                          a         else if a  A.length             ifi  m                 resultM  B[b]                          ifi  m1                 resultMPlus  B[b]                          b         else if A[a] lt B[b]              ifi  m                 resultM  A[a]                          ifi  m1                 resultMPlus  A[a]                          a         else             ifi  m                 resultM  B[b]                          ifi  m1                 resultMPlus  B[b]                          b                   iftotal2  0         return resultM  resultMPlus2     else         return resultM        public double findMedianSortedArrayslogint A[], int B[]      int total  A.length  B.length     int m  total  12  1     iftotal2  0         double m1  kthElem, A, B, 0, 0, A.length  1, B.length  1         double m2  kthElem1, A, B, 0, 0, A.length  1, B.length  1         return m1m22          else         return kthElem, A, B, 0, 0, A.length  1, B.length  1         .kthEle s 4 intarray [1 2 3] intarray [4 5 6 7] 0 0 2 3 public int kthEleint k, int[] a, int[] b, int aStart, int bStart, int aEnd, int bEnd      int aNum  aEnd  aStart  1     int bNum  bEnd  bStart  1     System.out.printlnaNum  bNum     if aNum  0 return b[bStart  k  1]     else if bNum  0 return a[aStart  k  1]     else if aNum  1 ampamp bNum  1         if k  1              return a[aStart]ltb[bStart]a[aStart]b[bStart]         else              return a[aStart]gtb[bStart]a[aStart]b[bStart]                   else         int aPivot  aNum  1  2         int bPivot  bNum  1  2         ifa[aStart  aPivot] gt b[bStart  bPivot]             ifk gt aPivot  bPivot  2                 return kthElek  bPivot  1, a, b, aStart, bStart  bPivot  1, aEnd, bEnd             else                  return kthElek, a, b, aStart, bStart, aStart  aPivot  1, bEnd                      else             ifk gt aPivot  bPivot  2                 return kthElek  aPivot  1, a, b, aStart  aPivot  1, bStart, aEnd, bEnd             else                  return kthElek, a, b, aStart, bStart, aEnd, bStart  bPivot  1                              codepre

Negative 64999 pWe were trying to do some integrity checks on our database state for diagnostic reasons, so we wrapped our modification ORM queries in a TransactionScope coupled with a second query that ran diagnostics  something like thisp  precodeusing TransactionScope scope  new TransactionScopeTransactionScopeOption.Required, maxTimeout      ORM.DeleteItem     ORM.CheckIntegrity     scope.Complete  codepre  pIts a handrolled ORM, and both those calls end up doing their bit in a nested transaction scope down at the bottom.  In other words, when you dig down, DeleteItem has using TransactionScope newScope  new TransactionScopeTransactionScopeOptions.Required, maxTimeout ...p  pand CheckIntegrity also has the same.p  pFor the most part its been working fine, but Ive run across an odd condition. When someone puts in some bad inputs to the query, the DeleteItem call can throw an exception.  That exception is completely caught and handled at a stack level below the wrapper.  I believe that exception is also thrown strongbeforestrong it gets to nesting the TransactionScope.p  pBut when we get down to the nested scope creation in the CheckIntegrity call, it throws a Transaction was aborted error from the CreateAbortingClone constructor.  The inner exception is null.p  pMost every other mention of the CreateAbortingClone interaction has to do with DTC promotion or failure thereof and the inner exception reflects that.p  pIm inferring that the abort exception on the CheckIntegrity call is due to the fact that the DeleteItem had thrown an exception  even though it was swallowed. p  pA is that a correct inference Is a TransactionScope sensitive to any exceptions thrown, handled or notp  pB is there any way to detect that before making the CheckIntegrity call  I mean other than redoing our ORM to let the exception percolate up or adding some other global flagp  pThanks Markp

Negative 64999 pI have a number of long linked lists they have up to 20,000 items. They have different beginnings but they can eventually point to the same node from some node onwards. Ive decided to let such linked list to grow together and share the memory between them.p  pThat is why I ve decided to implement linked list with shared pointersp  precodeinclude ltmemorygt struct SharedLinkedList      int someData     stdsharedptrltSharedLinkedListgt next  codepre  pThis way everything works fine. The linked lists which are no longer needed are deleted. If they share some part with other linked list only their unshared part is deleted.p  pThe problem apears when longer linked lists without shared parts are about to be deleted. Deleting starts with the first element. This decreases the number of references to the next element which can be also deleted and this repeats recursively until the stack overflows.p  pHere is the example of code which creates long linked list and then fails deleting it.p  precodeSharedLinkedList beginningOfList SharedLinkedList actualElement  new SharedLinkedList SharedLinkedList nextElement  beginningOfList  actualElement for int i  0 i lt 1000 i   100 is OK, 1000 is KO     nextElement  new SharedLinkedList     actualElementgtnext  stdsharedptrltSharedLinkedListgtnextElement     actualElement  nextElement  delete beginningOfList codepre  pI thank in advance for either of the followingp  ol liExplanation of sharedpointers and of what am I missing. How can I use them And can it even be done using them Isnt such sharing of memory the thing for which were the share pointers inventedli liadvice how to reimplement my codeli liThis code will be used for scientific computations which will be run on my computer. Can I tweak somehow something in order to have bigger size of stackli ol  pNote that this question is not c11 specific. I dont care which implementation of shared pointes is used. I even implemented my own shared pointers. This allowed me to have a little longer linked lists but the recursion in destructors and stack overflowing also appeared. And I dont see any way how could be shared pointers implemented without recursion in destructors.p  pEDITp  pJust to aviod confusions I want to repeat that the whole lists can be shared. So one could call them trees.p  pHere is the examplep  plist1 contains 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.p  plist2 contains 6,6,6,1,2,3,4,5,6,7p  plist3 contains 10,11,12,1,2,3,4,5,6,7p  pI want to represent this in 3 SharedLinkedList which do not waste momory by storing 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 several times but they point to the same place. That is why reference counting is needed.p  pcodedelete list3code is supposed to delete only the part which is not shared i.e. elements 10,11,12.p

Negative 64999 pI think I found an issue where ajax open functions are not behaving properly in google chrome after the version 28.0.1500.72 update. This issue was originally found using an embedded webserver as the server, but I have been able to reproduce it on an apache webserver as well. p  pThe issue occurs when I call ajaxObject.openGET,URL,true. This usually works, however sometimes the client pc running the javascript will not issue a GET request for the urlThis has been confirmed using wireshark. At this point ajaxObject.readyState changes from 1 to 2 to 4 as if it sent the request properly and received a response. This issue did not occur with chrome previously, and is not an issue on IE or firefox.  Interestingly, on a successful call, ajaxObject.readyState goes from 1, to 2, to 3, to 4.p  pWeve hard coded the headers on our embedded webserver to not cache the requested page fetched via ajax, as we need to request the page over and over again and refresh its contents.

Negative 64999 pIm developing a software solution that must have the following feature through the browserany, make a direct scan from a scanner connected to the users computer TWAIN WIA and send this image to my server. I read many articles about it, but Im still having not found a good solution. I found out that TWAIN solutions will require a plugin instalation from the user, and that WIA ones dont, but, on the other hand, they are not recognized by all scanners models. So I need to know whats the best way TWAIN or WIA Is there any possibility to create a TWAINWIA solution and dont require any plugin to use it I work with asp.net, jquery, rest, crossbrowser features and so on. Please, any hint will be very useful to me. If I handle this, Ill share my solution.p  pThanks.p  pPS The next step is to do OCR to extract the informations from the image file.p

Negative 64999 pI am creating a step plot using a selfdefined function stepPlot which is working. I got stuck when I attempted to put a geomtext inside this function.

There are two parts 1 labelPosiX is the horizontal position of the label text, and 2 geomtext where is at the end of the function. labelPosiY, the vertical position of the label, will be manually specified with a number.

Negative 64999 pThe program allows the user to enter a phrase and converts it to ROT13, where each English letter entered, becomes the letter 13 places after itA becomes N.

Negative 64999 pI have a listbox with 3 columns. In some rows there is no entry in the third column it was never populated.

I have also triedp  pif isnulllistbox1.listi,2 thenp  pbut again this produces a runtime error. I know I can get around this by using on error resume next, but I have a feeling there must be a better way.p  pEdit p  pThe error I get is Could not get the List property. Invalid argument.. In my actual code I refer to .listi,j and it works fine when j 0 and j  1, but when j  2 it errors. In the example I am testing there are NO ENTRIES in column 2 of the listbox whatsoever, but the listboxs columncount property is set to a value of 3.p

After I am done querying the database in the controller, I do the following, to pass the database object into the Twig templatep  precodepublic function searchActionword        query database using the word slug and prepare database object accordingly        dataObject  contains query results       return thisgtrenderGreatBundleDefaultsearch.html.twig, arrayword gt word  codepre  pThis is where I am stuck.

Negative 64999 pI have a windowsmedia player control embedded into a usercontrol which I dynamically add to the form. The problem is that this noticeably slows down the creation and drawing of the user control. This makes the whole program seem rather laggy.p  pI was wondering if anyone knows of any other lighter weight audio players.p  pAlternatively I guess I could create say 30 media players on my main form and pass a reference to these into the user control. But this seems a bit hacky to me.p  pThe media player needs p  pPlay, stop, pause, a way to track and change progress. I also need events to fire when the player pauses or stops...p  pPerhaps I am asking for too much  p  pAny ideas would be great. The application is too laggy now and I have tracked the problem to the creation of the mediaplayercontrol.p  pThanksp  pHere is the offending code p  precode        AxWMPLib.AxWindowsMediaPlayer myMediaPlayer  new AxWMPLib.AxWindowsMediaPlayer         myMediaPlayer.Name  name         myMediaPlayer.PositionChange  new AxWMPLib.WMPOCXEventsPositionChangeEventHandleraxMediaPlayerPositionChange         myMediaPlayer.PlayStateChange  new AxWMPLib.WMPOCXEventsPlayStateChangeEventHandleraxMediaPlayerPlayStateChange          this.Controls.AddmyMediaPlayer lt this is what is lagging things up. If I do not add the control to the page when I reference it I get  This error codepre  pAn exception of type System.Windows.Forms.AxHost.InvalidActiveXStateException occurred in AxInterop.WMPLib.dll but was not handled in user codep  pSo it seems the control needs to be added to the page.p  pEven if I set the control to visible  false before adding to the page I can not reference it.p  pSo it seems I must add the control to the page and I set visible  false right after I have added it. But still slow. I think it is just media player itself instantiating itself which is laggy. When I say laggy I mean it takes a couple of seconds. But this makes my program seem real laggy. I need to make it seem snappy.p  pAny ideas Guys Thanksp

Negative 64999 pFirst of all, this has nothing to do with the browsers cache, Im 100 sure about it.  p  pI really really hope you can help me with that. Im trying to fix this for more than 10 flat hours now.   p  pSo I was updating and deleting some files jpg,css,js and ico using my ftp account.br After the files were uploaded, I downloaded them again using my ftp account. So, I can confirm the files were uploaded correctly.br But now comes the weird thing I start a computer different ip, never visited my website. I cleaned the cache of the browser on the device 2 times just in case...br Then I visit the website and the cssjsjpgico files were not updated. Not even if I access them by directly typing their addresses in the addressbar.br Then I tried it on 2 other different devices. No success.br So I went back to my main computer and downloaded the files using my ftp login and yes the files were up2date. I waited more than a day for my favicon to show up correctly. But its still the original Joomla icon.  p  pNow you might think that I used a wrong ftp account, but I notices something very very weird. When I click show sourcecode in Firefox and then click on the link to the css file in the appearing window it shows the old file as expected.., but after pressing F5 it actually shows the correct one. When I now go back to the browser and type the address of my website again the new css is actually applied. When I reload it anothertime everything goes back to the old one though.  p  pUploading strongnewstrong files that didnt exist before are no problem at all btw. They are immidiately available.p  pI guess this has something to do with either my Joomla 3.1.5 or my hoster limacity.de. p  pstrongEditstrongbr Its getting even better.

Negative 64999 pTo whom it may concern,p  pI have a program that records sounds .wavs converted to .wmas and .m4as that Im trying to upload to SoundCloud previously the program had burned CDs of the WMP Playlists and then I added a section that made a .zip of the Playlist and attached it to an email, now my users want to upload the WMP playlists to their SoundCloud accounts.p  pIve already added a routine to upload the .zip file to Dropbox and that works fine. Since the oauth2 for Dropbox was very similar to the oauth2 for SoundCloud, I was able to add my App to the SoundCloud list of Apps, and then add a browser control to my program for the user to allow my App to link to their SoundCloud account very similar to how Dropbox handles it. So Im up to the point of uploading, but this is handled very differently and Im having a hard time trying to get this to work find the right HTTP handlers in Visual Basic to do what I need to do.p  pIn my Dropbox section, I simply had to create a POST message, with the Title of the file and the oauth2 accesstoken in the URL, then I simply out to read the .zip file or any file that I was going to upload and Write its contents to the GetRequestStream. The only stumbling block that I had was the ContentType which had to be applicationzip or whatever extension the file was and voila, It was uploaded.p  pIve been reading about multipart forms and Im getting a little confused again the mechanics of the HTTP structures in Visual Basic can be a bit differentduh...then in other languagesbut Ill try and explain.p  pI came across one example that used another constructor. Rather than the strongHttpRequeststrong that I had used to build my request and response communications, this one had a WebClient. The strongWebClientstrong could add Headers AcceptCharset, AcceptEncoding, AcceptLanguage, ContentType, ContentDisposition, and also a QueryString this is where I placed the oathtoken, track[assetdata], track[title], etc. Finally, the WebClient constructor had a WebClient.UploadFile command which took the URL and the physical filenamewhich I believed would then handle the writing of the file contents the Request.p  pSoafter getting through some 400s, 401s have to deal with expiring token stuff, 422s, a 503, and a bunch of 500s which is where Im currently at, I still cant upload a simple .wma file emTrack001.wmaem.p  blockquote   pHeres my code strFileName is already built with the physical name of   the sound file dirTrack001.wma, and strAccessToken was already   obtained from SoundCloudp blockquote  precodestrURL  httpsapi.soundcloud.comtracks.jsonoauthtoken amp strAccessToken Dim myWebClient As New WebClient myWebClient.Headers.AddAcceptCharset, ISO88591,utf8q0.7,q0.3 myWebClient.Headers.AddAcceptEncoding, gzip,deflate,sdch myWebClient.Headers.AddAcceptLanguage, enUS,enq0.8,ruq0.6 myWebClient.Headers.AddContentDisposition formdata nametrack[title] codepre  blockquote   pI  also tried this line as wellp blockquote  precode myWebClient.Headers.AddContentDisposition formdata name amp HttpUtility.UrlEncodestrFileName codepre  blockquote   pThis adds the SoundCloud paramsp blockquote  precodeDim myQueryStringCollection As New NameValueCollection myQueryStringCollection.Addoauthtoken, strAccessToken myQueryStringCollection.Addtrack[assetdata], strFileName myQueryStringCollection.Addtrack[title], Test Track Upload myQueryStringCollection.Addtrack[sharing], public myQueryStringCollection.Addtrack[downloadable], true myQueryStringCollection.Addtrack[postto],  codepre  blockquote   pThis attaches the params into the Requestp blockquote  precodemyWebClient.QueryString  myQueryStringCollection codepre  blockquote   pHeres where I try and send itp blockquote  precodeDim responseArray As Byte  myWebClient.UploadFilestrURL, strFileName codepre  blockquote   pBut Im receiving an error here strongerrors[errormessage422    Unprocessable Entity]strong   If I set the Contenttype to multiform, I   get strongThe ContentType header cannot be set to a multipart type for   this requeststrongp blockquote  pI just tried to get a 500 again, but all Im getting now is the 422 so maybe its fixed on the other end.p

Negative 64999 pI am working on jQuery mobile on intelxdk and trying to set navbar in footer with custom icons. I have tried so many codes and tried to change the icons. With jquery.mobile1.4.1 i am unable to find and set custom properties for nav bar icons. Now i tried my code with different versions which are not the latest onesbr 11.2.1 and 1.8.1 these are working and allowing custom nav bar icons. When i used latest jQuery which is 1.4.1 I find uiicon attribute in css but I found that it is applying through 1.4.1.js. I am stuck with that and want to use jQuery also for the slider.

Negative 64999 pHow do i completely close a JDialog window without closing the Frame one p  pI already tried using dispose, but seems it hides the JDialog instead of realeasing its memory, althought i believe this is not truth acoording to java API.  Is it correct to create a new JDialog when i hit the button from the Frame window, then i create a Menu inside JDialog class and pass this JDialog object to the Menu using a set method. When i choose the option of the menu GiveUp, I try to close JDialog object using dispose. Am i doing something wrong, or does anyone have a tip of what kind of problem i am having I have already spent may hours trying to solve this problem Ps This is a chess game which have the option to giveup during the current match and start a new one, but althouth some of the objects are lost after the dispose, most of them continue at the same position of the screen or in over another object.

Negative 64999 pIm the maintainer of the Meteor smart package a hrefhttpsatmospherejs.compackagezipzap relnofollowzipzapa and I would like to understand how a user of that package could possible specify if that package should be used on server, client or both. The package provides zip functionality, both on server and client. But if the user only needs server side zip functionality all files content still would be sent to the client and I dont see a way how to change that other than the user modifies the package.js.p  pA package.js looks like thisp  precodePackage.onusefunction api    api.addfilespathtofile.js, [server, client]  codepre  pThis is hardcoded so the user doesnt have any way to specify which files will be transferred to the client.p  pI see how my case might not be that common, as most packages either provide functionality for the server strongorstrong client, or in some way interact with each other. But I see the same problem for client side packages which provide multiple features but the user only needs few of them and most of the code therefore never is required. Isnt there a way how the user could interact with the package and sayp  ul liI only need this on serverli liActivate feature Xli liDisable feature Yli ul  pI know the package system is not yet final and is the last big thing to be finished before Meteor 1.0. So it might be that any answer to that question might be obsolete next week. Thought I still ask.p

Negative 64999 pI am using MATLAB in my office and Octave when I am at home. Although they are very similar, I was trying to do something I would expected to be very easy and obvious, but found it really annoying. I cant find out how to import tiff images in Octave. I know the MATLAB geotiffread function is not present, but I thought there would be another method. I could also skip importing them, as I can work also with imread sunction in some cases, but then the second problem would be I cant find a way to write a georeferenced tiff file in MATLAB I normally call geotiffwrite with geotiffinfo inputs inside. My tiff are usually 8bit unsigned integer or 32bit signed integer.

Negative 64999 pso I made my own classobject for the date DMY.java, and when I try to sort the list, the memory usage goes from 20,000k to almost 700,000k. I have narrowed it down to the sorting method that was causing the memory to go through the roof. It instantiates a few objects in the method, so I assume that is what is taking all of the memory up. But does anyone think that they can help me optimize it to use less memory Here is the codep  precode   public static ArrayListltStringgt sortListByDateArrayListltStringgt list            DMY currDate  null        DMY oldDate1  null        DMY oldDate2  null        ArrayListltStringgt temp  new ArrayListltStringgt         forint x  0 x lt list.size x             currDate  new DMYRegex.matchPatternlist.getx, d[]d[]d d[]d[]d.trim, false             iftemp.size  0                  temp.addlist.getx              else iftemp.size  1                 oldDate1  new DMYRegex.matchPatterntemp.get0, d[]d[]d d[]d[]d.trim, false                ifcurrDate.compareToFulloldDate1  1                     temp.add0, list.getx                 else                     temp.addlist.getx                             else                 forint y  0 y lt temp.size y                     ifx  1 lt temp.size                         temp.addlist.getx                     else                         oldDate1  new DMYRegex.matchPatterntemp.getx, d[]d[]d d[]d[]d.trim, false                        oldDate2  new DMYRegex.matchPatterntemp.getx  1, d[]d[]d d[]d[]d.trim, false                         ifcurrDate.compareToFulloldDate1  1 ampamp currDate.compareToFulloldDate2  1                             temp.addx  1, list.getx                                                                                                 return temp     codepre  pBasically, if the size of the sorted list is 0, just add the line to the new list. If the size of the sorted list is 1, see if the new date is before or after that one date, then add it to the sorted list accordingly. Otherwise, simply loop through each value in the list and see if the date of the next two lines are newer or older than the current one. Then add it accordingly.p  pAs you can see, there are a lot of objects and a lot of loops. The original list is a list of strings that contain a date. What the method does is get the date using regex and then compares it to the other dates in the list. For some reason it is using a lot of memory and I need to reduce it. Any ideasp

Negative 64999 pI need to setup my line chart with category values that are daily even though there might be multiple values for each day. I still need the graph to show each data value separately.  For example, if I have five values in one day I need those five points to appear on the graph in timeorder between two category axis lines.  I do not want a separate category axis line for each value point.  The best example I can give is with blood pressure readings.  Someone may test their blood pressure five times in one day.  I want those five points to appear in their relative timeorder between two categories that represent today and tomorrow rather than have five different categories, one for each value point.p  pIs this possible  I cannot see how through the documentation, blogs, and stackoverflow question.p
Negative 64999 pI have written a c MFC DLL that brings up an SDI Application which is a very legacy OLE Server.

Negative 64999 pI ran into this issue today, and managed to repeat it with this small stub of script, running with python 2.7.6 on a win7x64 machine, but the issue came up using portable python on various windows platforms in a much larger scriptp  precodefrom subprocess import PIPE, Popen from time import sleep class Testobject     def runcmdself, cmd, waitTrue         p  Popencmd, stdinPIPE, stdoutPIPE, stderrPIPE         if wait             p.communicate             return p         else             return p     def somethingself         p  self.runcmdnotepad, waitFalse         import pdb pdb.settrace         while not p.poll             print process still running             sleep10         print p.returncode, p.stdout, p.stderr     def somethingelseself         p  self.runcmdnotepad                 print p.returncode, p.stdout, p.stderr  t  Test t.somethingelse t.something codepre  pWhat happens is, somethingelse launches a process in the foreground and the python script waits for it to exit and print the return code, stdout and stderr, but in the second call, something, the process is launched, but whether or not you end the process, python stays in the loop. I then added the pdb step and this is the output, p  precodegtgtgt t.something gt ltstdingt12something Pdb print p ltsubprocess.Popen object at 0x0000000002D73D68gt Pdb p.poll  SyntaxError SyntaxErrorinvalid syntax, ltstringgt, 1, 1, .poll Pdb codepre  pThe poll, instead of returning None while the process is open, and settingreturning the return code when it is done, always returns None, with the additional output only in the debugger. The process is launched and operates as expected. Any idea what Im doing that is causing the subprocess.poll to return invalid syntax Its strange, as it does not throw an exception, it just never gets updated to return the return code and any attempt to print p.pid, p.stdin, p.stdout all produce the same error, but again, only in the debugger. p

Negative 64999 pIm having trouble translating from some C declarations to Delphi XE2 for calling functions in a DLL. I translated all the function declarations from a Visual Basic source file, but in testing them I ran in to problems. Some functions returned Long values, but debugging my code I observed that the functions involved returned values that werent right. Then I turned to the original code in C, and there I found the root of my troubles At some point in the original C code there is this declarationp  precodetypedef struct   RSICHANNEL        typedef RSICHANNEL FAR RSICHANNEL codepre  pNow, some functions return RSICHANNEL those functions return values like thisp  precodereturn RSICHANNELws codepre  pAnd ws is declared asp  precodersiChannel FAR ws  new FAR rsiChannel codepre  prsiChannel is a typedef struct. So far, so good...by now I guess some of you may have recognized this as PIMPL idiom. Ok, according to the source code comments, I should have to save that return value RSICHANNEL and test against NULL, and pass it through function calls untouched...nothing more...so my take is it should be implemented in Delphi as Pointer. But it doesnt work. Something like thisp  precodeType    RSICHANNEL  Pointer  ... later in implementation block ...  Function rsiInitWsockHostName  PAnsiChar port  Long  RSICHANNEL stdcall external rsidll32 codepre  pNo compile errors, no runtime errors. If I call this function, I get Nil.p  pAny idea how this could be implemented in Delphi XE2 and, what Im doing wrong thanks in advance.p  pAdditional detailsp  ul liDelphi XE2 target Win32li liWindows 7 x64li ul  hr  pI found the problem it didnt had to do with my code, it was right since the beginning it has to do with a ping function in the DLL, it worked on a laptop but it doesnt want to work with a desktop PC both Win7, and when it doesnt work it breaks subsequent function calls to the DLL why, I dont know...yet. Anyway, it wasnt a full solution, but DavidHeffernan was the first to come up with the idea that the problem was someplace else, so Im accepting his answer mainly because it pointed me in the right direction.

I want to write a bidirectional iterator for that class, which outputs only the EVEN numbers in the vector. Is there an easy and instructive way Id prefer not using libraries other than STL.p

Negative 64999 pWe have a legacy application that allows our developers to add messages via a ThreadLocal in Java.p  pThe current SOAP endpoints will scoop these messages off the thread and then package them up in the response. p  pThe endpoints also catch all exceptions and then marshal those exceptions via this same mechanism to normalize the passing of messages be they informational, warning, or error.p  pThese messages are rich objects they have a code, severity, classification, and then the actual message text.p  pThis is nice in many ways because now we have a standard way to communicate meaningful messages to the user or calling service but it also makes using the API more challenging because now the client must pick out the messages from the response AND also pick out the real payload. p  pAny web service can communicate messages this way...but only a handful do.p  pI would like to start moving our application towards a REST API but I am struggling on how best to handle the messaging. I am not super keen on adding an envelope to each of our REST responses because this really pollutes the API. p  pThe alternative appears to be adding these messages to custom HTTP headers. Is this the preferred approach Remember I will have a list of one or more of these messages and I will likely have to serialize them as json as well. p  pThanks.p

Negative 64999 pI have a new problem again. This time, it is the streamwriter causing the trouble. See, in my code, I have a data set, which I am trying to export to excel. The code basically goes through all the records in the dataset, and add them to a string. Then streamwriter object writes the whole string to a file. This is a properly working code, except one minor issue. p  pIn all date columns, the date is in YYYYMMDD HHMMSS format. When it is written to excel, streamwriter converts it to mmddyyyy hhmmss format. But, excel defaults to ddmmyyyy hhmmss format. So, half of the dates are displayed wrong, as excel is unable to find month greater than 12. p  pE.g. when date is 20141016 000000, streamwriter writes it as 10162014 000000. When I open the file in excel, excel interprets it as 10th day of 16th month. p  pNow, I know, there is a way to format the data in an excel column, but that does literally nothing. p  pI checked and am completely unable to find out where I am going wrong.

Negative 64999 pI am very new on javaandroid, just worked with processing before. Therefore all those packages, sources, libs are really a problem for me.  Right now I would like to load an .obj file using the min3d library. The problem is, that i want to display the .obj on the  a hrefhttpcommander3d.com relnofollowcommmander 3d tableta. Therefore I downloaded an working example for the tablet with a stereoscopic 3d renderer class from this a hrefhttpwww.sdeck.org relnofollowSDK no need to log ina. In the package, where in my example cubes are generated, i would like to instead load the .obj. But I get an activity error. I am not sure, if the .obj is found, but i think it should, because if i only load it and do not parse it, i dont get an error. But if I start to parse parser.parse then the mess begins. The .obj is in this folders SampleActivity  res  raw  camaroobj. The next 3 lines aftzer the parse i already uncommented, because at first this should work. But i know already, that the appChild is not avaible. This will be the next problem. Below is the code of the package, the console and the logCat.

Negative 64999 pI have a bean where I define multiple validation annotations for each field e.g.p  precodeNotEmpty Patternregexpd Minvalue1 String myField codepre  pI have encountered striketwostrike one problem that I cannot resolve in any easy way. p  ol listrikeValidation order of the specified annotations for each field is random i.e. do not happen in the order the annotations are defined. I believe GroupSequence will not help since it only defines group validation sequence, not annotation sequence.strike As Tom correctly commented, violations are reported as Set which means there is no 11 mapping between execution order of annotations and reported violations.li liI want to invalidate only one rule for each field i.e. if it does not match pattern do not try to check if the value is  1. Currently if is set myField to abc it will report both Pattern and Min violations. Setting failFast property of a validator to true does not help because Im using the same validator instance to validate all the fields in my bean, and it will stop validating other fields as soon as the first violation for the whole bean is encountered.li ol  pEdit. I tried to implement custom composite constraint with ReportAsSingleViolation. The problem is that it will report the same message for all violations involved in composition. This is not what I need.p  pSuggestions, pleasep

Negative 64999 pIve manually created a google 2factor auth key which gives me the file .googleauthenticator which holds the keyinformation.p  pI want the same key to be used for all my users when anyone tries to login.

Negative 64999 pI am writing to ask if anyone knows how to go about this. I do not need the code, I would just like the logic behind doing this. So I have a set A,B,C,D,E. Now I want to find all combinations of and or OR operators amongst the values in the set. p  pSome examples below. p  precodeA and B and C and D and E  A and B and C and D or E A and B and C or D and E codepre  pFrom what I know there is 2n1 possibilities in the case above. So in the specific example above we would have 8 combinations. p  pIn addition to the Above the values in the set can have two possibilities. For simplicities sake lets say A can be True or False. Likewise B,C,D and E. So what we would potentially have is something like the following  p  precodeATrue and BTrue and CTrue and DTrue and ETrue ATrue and BTrue and CTrue and DTrue and EFalse ATrue and BTrue and CTrue and DTrue or ETrue  codepre  pand so on. So taking this into account we would have 22  n1 combinations. So in our specific example above again we would have 16 combinations for a set of 4. p  pIs there an algorithm that already does this If not would anyone have some logic to implement this in Javap  pThanks,p

Negative 64999 pIm developing an my first iOS application, which utilizes a web servicedata API that Ive written. Users can create accounts and retrieve information using this API after theyve logged inbeen authenticated. All users have say a username, user id, profile picture, biography, etc... Ive created an NSObject user which is a class that has corresponding propertiesattributes. After logging in, in each viewcontroller we need access to this user data, and the solution Ive implemented for now is to give each viewcontroller a property user that expects my user object. Each time I instantiate a view controller, I am assigning the user class instance to the user property of the viewcontroller, so that I can access the properties of that instantiated user class from within the viewcontroller. I know that this not an optimal solution, but since Im hacking along trying to learn iOS as I go, this is what Ive run with for now.p  pMy question is What is the best way to persist this user data for use across multiple view controllers in my application p  pOther notes  The amount of data that I need to persist is relatively little and is of types NSString, NSNumber, and UIImage. My user class is being instantiated for the current loggedin user, and also for other users for, for example, when retrieving data for a friend and then viewing their profile. Access to data for a user must be only if the user has been authenticated, so I need to be able to destroy the datastore once the session has expired.p

So, starting from ROW 1, find the next TR element, and then find the first child TD element within that TR element.p  pHowever, when I write the CSS selector, it returns codenullcode.p  pMy CSS selector syntax isp  precodetr.row  tr td codepre  pHeres a full working examplep  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt      ltscriptgt         function findRow                      var row1  document.querySelectortr.row             var targetCell  row1.querySelectortr.row  tr td             alerttargetCell              ltscriptgt  ltheadgt  ltbodygt      lttablegt         lttr class  rowgt             lttd class  cellgtlttdgt         lttrgt         lttr class  rowgt             lttd class  cellgtlttdgt         lttrgt     lttablegt      ltscriptgt         findRow     ltscriptgt  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pSo the selector code.row1code successfully gives me the TR element with id coderow1code.p  pHowever, the second selector, code.row1  tr tdcode, returns codenullcode.  p  pNow, if instead of calling codequerySelectorcode using the codeTRcode element, I call codedocument.querySelectorcode, it works.  I can even call coderow1.parentNode.querySelectorcode, and then it works as well.  This indicates to me that the actual Element which emcallsem codequerySelectorcode is emnotem included in the set of elements to be searched.p  pUnfortunately, that is not a solution here.  This is just a simplified example  in my actual usecase, I cant call codequerySelectorcode from a parent element above coderow1code, because then I will lose the context Im in  in my real use case I have many, dynamicallygenerated rows, so if I call codedocument.querySelectorcode, or even coderow1.parentNode.querySelectorcode Ill lose my context.p  pI realize I can just do this with plain DOM traversal loops, but Im trying to get in the habit of using codequerySelectorcode here, since that is obviously better for the future.  Also, Im not using jQuery here.  I also suspect the codescopecode selector would help here, but unfortunately that is not yet widely supported.p  pSo it is possible to do what I want using codequerySelectorcodep
Negative 64999 pI have a UITabBarController that contains 2 UIViewControllers. The 2nd UIViewController crashes when ever I try to show from the 1st UIViewController.

Negative 64999 pI am currently optimising a complex view containing many nested views. therefor i have created a custom layout extending the relativelayout class. Based on data set from outside the class i further build the view with childs. The child building is done within the custom layout. I got it working and the performance gain is enourmous.

Negative 64999 pI have recently obtained a new SSL Certificate and have managed to get it working by adding the HTTPS binding to port 7000. Originally the site only had one binding and that was a HTTP binding to port 80. I am wondering if anyone has ideas as to why when I have the two bindings set as suchp  pHTTP  port 80 HTTPS  port 7000p  pI can stop and start the site with no issues. Here is what it gets strange for me...p  pWhen I change the bindings to just HTTPS on port 80 IIS responds with an error when I try to start it saying that a website is already running on said port. p  pAfter using netstat ano  findstr 80, I was able to locate all processes that were using port 80. Mainly it was PID 4 with a description of NT Kernal amp System. SO with that being said I do not want to kill that process because I believe it is necessary. p  pDoes anyone have ideas or two cents on the situation as to why HTTP port 80 can start fine, but HTTPS port 80 binding causes a error saying a website is already using port 80.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 64999 pSo I have been trying out ZingCharts which in general I like a ton. But now I am trying to create a live feed and the a hrefhttpwww.zingchart.comdocsfeaturesfeeds relnofollowdocumentationa isnt all that clear. I am trying to use HTTP to update a chart with new values. It seems that I need to have a page that is sending the chart data with updated values and that is what I am doing. This chart renders correctly when I past the JSON directly in the browser but not as a live feed, it now only ememphasized textemcorrectly pulls from the metricsfeed and renders the outline of the chart but it is all grey. The JSON I am sending over HTTP isp  precode   crosshairx ,   legend ,   plot      valueBox        placement top,       type max, min,       visible false        ,   scaleX      label        text Metric count        ,   scaleY      label        text Metric value        ,   series [            text data point,       values [         4.69283003950355,         4.692830039503548,         4.6928300395035505       ]        ],   title      text metrics over time   ,   tooltip ,   type line  codepre  pAnd I am planning to update those values every second or so. Here is my HTML side codep  precodeltheadgt  ...  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt var myChart  refresh     typefeed,     transporthttp,     urlmetricsfeed,     interval1000           window.onloadfunction         zingchart.render             idmyChartDiv,             datamyChart,             height600,             width100                ltscriptgt ltheadgt  ltbodygt     ltdiv idmyChartDivgtltdivgt ltbodygt codepre  pAnd this all works when I copy the direct JSON in there instead of sending it over HTTP so there is something I am missing in the Zingcharts documentation I suppose.p

My code looks like thisp  precode        ltphp          paged  getqueryvarpaged  getqueryvarpaged  1          querypostsarray             posttype      gt post,  You can add a custom post type if you like             paged          gt paged,             postsperpage gt 3,                   if  haveposts             gt              ltphp whilehaveposts  thepost gt codepre  plt The Loop p  precode            ltphp endwhile gt              ltphp wppagenavi gt          ltphp endif gt codepre  pI am also using PageNavi but after trying other solutions Ive determined this is not the problem. Any idea what is going onp  pThanks p

Negative 64999 pI have a data problem I need to clean up. Basically I have two tables storing package information, one table for documents and one table for audit information. I have entries in the package tables that reference documents that no longer exist and have been replaced same name but different id and I want to write a query to find all the bad ones and which new document should replace them. The only thing linking these two is a string value in the audit table which stores the document name not id.p  pIve setup a sample schema here a hrefhttpsqlfiddle.com4997bda1 relnofollowhttpsqlfiddle.com4997bda1ap  ul lipackages is the single values for a package in our applicationli lipackager is the repeating values for a package in our application ul lithese are joined with the same value in the id columnli ulli liauditinfo is all the audit information in a packageli lidocs is all the documents that can be attached to a packageli ul  pThis query finds the packages with bad attachments may be more than one per packagep  precodeselect distinct ps.pkgname, pr.doclist from packages ps, packager pr where ps.id  pr.id and not exists    select 1 from docs   where pr.doclist  id    order by 1,2 asc  codepre  pI need to build a query with the following rulesp  ul liI need to return at least the package id, the position value and the new document id I will build an update statement to put this new document id in the row matching the package id  position in the packager tableli lithe way to get the document name from the audit information is SUBSTRdescription,0,INSTRdescription,[2li liIf the document was Added and then Removed, it should be ignored string1li listring2 must not be Supportingli lithe new document must match state  Master latest  1 pub  0li ul  pRight now I have a semiworking script that works on a per package basis, but the problem is affecting 2000 packages. I find the audit entries that dont match documents correctly attached to the package and then search for those names in the document table. The problem with this is since there is no direct link between the package and document tables, if there are multiple problem attachments on one package, each new document is returned once per position value, i.e.p  precodepackage id      bad doc id      position      new doc id p1              d1              1            d1new p1              d1              1            d4new p1              d4              2            d1new p1              d4              2            d4new codepre  pIt doesnt matter which new id goes into which position value, but the duplication result problem like this makes it hard to mass generate update scripts, some manual filtering would be required.p  pThis is a somewhat complex and unique data issue, so any help would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 64999 pEnvironment [Spring boot, hibernate, postgres, tomcat, REST]p  pThe question i have is related to persistence of the authentication token sub object i.e. the principal field, which holds an  UserRepositoryUserDetails object. The UserRepositoryUserDetails is the  object that extends an customer Users model and implements UserDetails interface as well as 2 other customer interfaces. p  pSo in order to better explain the problem let me compare usual authentication using the DaoAuthenticationProvider and UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken.  Please take a look into the picture below that represents the state of UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken  after successful authentication. That token has a field called principal that holds tha raw model data i.e. the UserRepositoryUserDetails  that is pulled from the database. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlPbyJ.png altenter image description herep  pAfter successful authentication if the user is trying to load the welcome page, in the welcome controller, we are able to resolve AuthenticationPrincipal trough the usage of the CurrentUser annotation thus get access to the currently loged in user properties including the object that is located in the principal field i.e. UserRepositoryUserDetailsp  precodeRequestMappingvalue , methodRequestMethod.GET     public String welcomeMapltString, Objectgt model, HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp, CurrentUser Users currentUser    ...         Authentication auth  SecurityContextHolder.getContext.getAuthentication         String name  auth.getName get logged in username ...  codepre  pWith that construct it all works great i.e. the token has access to all fields. One important property of that principal field is that the object located in that field is that same after the token is created  and after the it is resolved by the CurrentUser annotation for example During the creation of the object if i put a breakpoint in the AbstractUserDetailsAuthenticationProvider authenticate methods return statement, i am able to see, that   UserRepositoryUserDetails object reference is for example  225b57d5p  p.............UserRepositoryUserDetails225b57d5p  pI see the same reference when the CurrentUser Users currentUser is resolved in my index page i.e.p  p.............UserRepositoryUserDetails225b57d5p  pAll good till now. p  pBasically that is the problem that i am facing but when using my own authentication filters, provider and token. I have implemented my own authentication schema in spring security. I am using my own authentication provider and my own authentication token. I am able to create a token which has the field principal as in any other standard spring token and i am assigning the UserRepositoryUserDetails object into that  principal field. However when the index page of the application is requested,  i see that all of my tokens fields are fine except the field principal field i.e. the object that is located in princial is recognized that it is an UserRepositoryUserDetails object but all its field values are null. i.e. username, salt, details are all set to null. Thus when the welcome page is requested the CurrentUser annotation CurrentUser Users currentUser is returning  some object i.e. the object itself is not null and it is of type UserRepositoryUserDetails, but that object field values are all null. Screenshot attached.p  p[enter image description here][2]p  pI have noticed that the reference number of that object is different during the creation of that object in one of the filters is 32a5f5ccp  p.............UserRepositoryUserDetails32a5f5ccp  pand after resolving it by the CurrentUser annotation in the controller responsible for the welcome page 5628290dp  p.............UserRepositoryUserDetails5628290dp  pnow if i am interpreting that right those two are completely different objects, compared with the situation of DaoAuthenticationProvider and UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken.p  pThe token used during the authentication is initialized only once in the custom filter trough a constructor. The object is only changedupdated i.e. not replaced by another object of the same type  once in the customer authentication Provider i.e. trough a method  setAuthenticated  and then it can be seen that the presumably correct token is assigned to the SecurityContextHolder. trough the statement.p  precodeSecurityContextHolder.getContext.setAuthenticationauthentication codepre  pSo my question here really is where do i start searching what exactly is changing that principal UserRepositoryUserDetails object i.e. i have first thought that the method eraseCredentials  that is part of the CredentialsContainer is somehow related to the problem, but then i have Overritten the implementation of eraseCredentials in my token to a simple print statement it order to make sure this does not affect the flow. Now my question is how to debug this scenario i.e. how do i watchobserve when exactly the token is being changed. I am not really familiar with the concept of a proxy object, thus my suspection Could this be related to some proxy AOP, CGLIB mojo magic that is deleting the field of the UserRepositoryUserDetails object. One more thing that i notice is that the rest of the fields are fine for example the token has other fields such as description, authorities, details etc., beside the principal field, but only the object that is being hold in the principal field is affected i.e. the UserRepositoryUserDetails.p  pPlease note that i have set the annotation  EnableWebMvcSecurity as per spring manual, i.e. The following annotations are set on my SecurityConfig class that extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter p  precodeEnableWebMvcSecurity  EnableWebSecurity EnableGlobalMethodSecurityprePostEnabled  true Configuration codepre  pparts of pomp  precodeltpropertiesgt     ltjavaversiongt1.8ltjavaversiongt     ltspringversiongt4.1.6.RELEASEltspringversiongt     ltorg.aspectjversiongt1.6.10ltorg.aspectjversiongt      ltorg.slf4jversiongt1.7.6ltorg.slf4jversiongt     ltspringBootVersiongt1.1.7.RELEASEltspringBootVersiongt     lttomcat.versiongt8.0.5lttomcat.versiongt     ltproject.build.sourceEncodinggtUTF8ltproject.build.sourceEncodinggt     lthibernategt4.3.1.Finallthibernategt     ltspring.data.redisgt1.4.1.RELEASEltspring.data.redisgt     ltjedisgt2.6.1ltjedisgt     ltspringsecuritygt4.0.1.RELEASEltspringsecuritygt ltpropertiesgt codepre  pAny ideas are greatly appreciated.p  pTitop  pAddition 12 May 2015p  pI found my problem. It was related to the redis session storage. I found that when i disable my application redis support it all worked well.

Negative 64999 pOur current authorization strategy on our site is very tightly coupled to our RDBs schema  which in some ways is a good thing, since it means the permissions available to a user exactly match what he should have, assuming a correct interpretation of the data. So when we query for authorization, were asking about foreign keym2m relationships.p  pI see two main problems with this first, interpreting relational data is much more difficult to get right than reading explicit permissions from a separate table. The bigger problem I see is that this does not scale. As the app has grown, our permissions checks have gone from a single query across three tables to multiple queries across ten or more tables. p  pThe strategy Ive seen in a lot of places that solves this problem is explicit authorization roles or claimsbased for example. Because this kind of thing is simple enough to just stick in a single table, it seems simpler, faster, and more scalable. The thing that bothers me about it is this how do you avoid duplication of data p  pFor example, I have a User that owns a Design. Thats currently accomplished with a foreign key. In switching to explicit authorization, I would add the users id to a table containing the designs id and type. Should I remove the foreign key as well Should permissionsrelevant relationships always be mediated by the permissions table, or should I duplicate the data between the relational representation and the permissions table p  pIt seems like one the downsides of moving to explicit authorization could include performance, especially if a service call or something was required to fully discover permissions.p

Negative 64999 pI have a class called UserInfo, which grabs data from the authenticated user on the page, using PrincipalContext.  This work succesfully on page load.  I capture the users active directory display name, on page load in a label.  p  pProblem  I would like to redirect to a post page.  The code included works if I do not redirect the user to a different page, which Interent research indicates is because the state is retained.  Moreover, even though I receive the null error in debug mode, the data is actually stored in the database, as expected.  But, when I do try to redirect the user to a new page, presumably the value of the label is lost and this error occurs.  I do not know why the redirect causes the page to reload again, but because the label value is lost my error then becomes a null reference unhandled by user code.  I have attempted to check for a null value, and to instantiate the class, as several posts have indicated, but when I perform debugging, the error shows up on this line  lbRequesterName.Text  userinfo.DisplayName So, clearly I am doing something wrong.

Negative 64999 pI know this seems to have multiple duplicates but there is no real solution mentioned anywhere. p  pLets put a real world examplep  pFor testing, Ive to load a model in my application 25 times a day. Im getting a MessageBox that the model isnt created with the newest version of our software every time I load it. I know what I do so in my local copy I outcomment this check for faster testing.  Of course I dont want to push this change, just keep it locally over the next few months or so while updating and adding new functionality to the project every day. I want to do the same thing with different files in different situations, so the process should be easy and fast.    p  pIve read about stashing, but as far as I get it, it basically meansp  ul listash means save your changesli libring your working copy to a state that it only differs in what you want to pushli licommit and push your changesli lirestore your working copy to the previous state by reloading your stashed changes stash popli ul  pThis process has to be done every time you commit or update.p  pHmmm... I mean, are they serious  In SVN you simply commit means push what you want to commit and leave all other things alone. Finished. If you update your working copy the changed file is merged of course. If there should be a conflict while merging happens in 1 of 10000 cases you are notified and must solve it. After you solved the conflict in your local copy updating works fine again. Done.p  pSo the difference seems to be that SVN lets you decide what belongs to the shared repository while git demands that all repositories are always in the same state or will be after your commitpush. If you need different data you have to use complicated work arounds emall the timeem.p  pIs that true or do I miss something herep

Negative 64999 pI am trying to extract data from a binary table in a FITS file using Python and astropy.io. The table contains an events array with over 2 million events. What I want to do is store the TIME values of certain events in an array, so I can then do analysis on that array. The problem I have is that, whereas in fortran using FITSIO the same operation takes maybe a couple of seconds on a much slower processor, the exact same operation in Python using astropy.io is taking several minutes. I would like to know where exactly the bottleneck is, and if there is a more efficient way to access the individual elements in order to determine whether or not to store each time value in the new array. Here is the code I have so farp  precodefrom astropy.io import fits  minenergy0.3 maxenergy0.4 xcen20000 ycen20000 radius50  datafilefits.opendatafile.fits eventsdatafile[EVENTS].data   datafile.close  times[]  for i in rangelenevents     energyevents[PI][i]     if energyltmaxenergy1000         if energygtminenergy1000             xevents[X][i]             yevents[Y][i]             radius2xxcenxxcenyycenyycen             if radius2ltradiusradius                 times.appendevents[TIME][i]  print times codepre  pAny help would be appreciated. I am an ok programmer in other languages, but I have not really had to worry about efficiency in Python before. The reason I have chosen to do this in Python now is that I was using fortran with both FITSIO and PGPLOT, as well as some routines from Numerical Recipes, but the newish fortran compiler I have on this machine cannot be persuaded to produce a properly working program there are some issues of 32 vs. 64bit, etc.. Python seems to have all the functionality I need FITS IO, plotting, etc, but if it takes forever to access the individual elements in a list, I will have to find another solution.p  pThanks very much.p

Negative 64999 pTrying to make a really simple form. Im using Jquery Ajax to send a POST request to a PHP page which then writes the form data to an SQL database as well as returning success  error messaging which should be displayed through a javascript alert.p  pThe alert always gives an undefined message. p  pAs an additional slightly weird issue further submissions of the form seem to increase the actual submissions of the form by one each time without page refresh, 2nd submission will send data twice, 3rd submission will send 3 times etc. This is probably not a mission critical issue as realistically i would never be allowing a user to send this form more than once without a page refresh, however for my own learning and sanity id really like to get to the bottom of why its doing this.p  pThis is very possibly a very simple issue, and if so i apologise in advance.. first time ive attempted server communication.p  pThanks a lot for your help and if any additional information is needed, please let me know p

Negative 64999 pbr Im making a website which will let you update an SQL table, and I want to add some sort of feedback when a button is clicked. I have made an invisible button opacity0 which lies to the right of each row as a status. I made this JS fade function to set the opacity to 1, then slowly bring it back to 0, so a message pops up then fades away. p  precode function fade       var invis  document.getElementByIdinvis.concatnum.toString         ifinvis.style.opacity gt .990              invis.style.opacity  invis.style.opacity  .001             setTimeoutfade, 50          else ifinvis.style.opacity gt 0              invis.style.opacity  invis.style.opacity  .05             setTimeoutfade, 50               codepre  pThe trouble is, since webpages are singlethreaded, any other action will interrupt the animation and leave behind a halffaded status. So thats no good. So now I am trying to set up the invisible buttons to change class when a new row is updated. The new class looks like this p  precode.invisibleanim      ...     opacity 0     animationtrans 3000ms  keyframes trans      0         opacity 1           50          opacity 1      codepre  pThis works fine, except it only works once. From here I cannot get the animation to play a second time. I have tried changing the class back to invisible then invisibleanim with no luck. I also cant use JQuery or Webkit. Im wondering if theres some flag you can set for a button without actually clicking on it so I can reset the class when I need to Or even some way to thread my JS function so I can stick with that. p  pIm also a turbonoob when it comes to this stuff. I hadnt touched JS or CSS until about a week ago, so if theres some other solution I dont know about, feel free to suggest an alternative. p  pEDIT Our fearless hero Daemedeor saved the day. I added a listener to my statusp  precode    var invis  document.getElementByIdinvis.concatnum.toString     invis.addEventListeneranimationend, listener, false codepre  pthen added this lovely function p  precode    function listenere      var invis  document.getElementByIdinvis.concatnum.toString     switche.type      case animationend         invis.className  invisible         break       codepre  pAnd I got exactly what I was looking for.

Does any one have any idea on how to remove this. This additional scale only comes up when the max value crosses 80.p  pWe do not want to set the max value for reasons below 1.  The max value is dynamic, there are cases it might be like 56 and setting the max to a fixed value will not go well. 2.  We do not want to set the max value same as the data max.p  pThanks, Sarathp
Negative 64999 pA common beef I get when trying to evangelize the benefits of learning freehand SQL to MS Access users is the complexity of creating the effects of a crosstab query in the manner Access does it.  I realize that strictly speaking, in SQL it doesnt work that way  the reason its possible in Access is because its handling the rendering the of the data.p  pSpecifically, when I have a table with entities, dates and quantities, its frequent that we want to see a single entity on one line with the dates represented as columnsp  pThisp  precodeentity       date      qty           278700002   112016  5 278700002   212016  3 278700002   212016  8 278700002   312016  1 278700003   212016  12 codepre  pBecomes thisp  precodeEntity      1116   2116   3116          278700002    5       11        1 278700003            12 codepre  pThat said, the common way weve approached this is something similar to thisp  precodewith vals as    select     entity,     case when orderdate  20160101 then qty else 0 end as q1601,     case when orderdate  20160201 then qty else 0 end as q1602,     case when orderdate  20160301 then qty else 0 end as q1602   from mydata  select   entity, sum q1601 as q1601, sum q1602 as q1602, sum q1603 as q1603 from vals group by entity codepre  pThis is radically oversimplified, but I believe most people will get my meaning.p  pThe main problem with this is not the limit on the number of columns  the data is typically bounded, and I can make due with a fixed number of date columns  36 months, or whatever, depending on the context of the data.  My issue is the fact that I have to change the dates every month to make this work.p  pI had an idea that I could leverage arrays to dynamically assign the quantity to the index of the array, based on the month away from the current date.  In this manner, my data would end up looking like thisp  precodeEntity      Values    278700002  5,11,1 278700003  0,12,0 codepre  pThis would be quite acceptable, as I could manage the rendering of the actual columns within whatever rendering tool I was using Excel, for example.p  pThe problem is Im stuck...  how do I get from my data to this.  If this were Perl, I would loop through the data and do something like thisp  precodeforeach my ref data    my entity, monthoffset, qty  ref   valuesentitygt[monthoffset]  qty  codepre  pBy this isnt Perl...  so far, this is what I have, and now Im at a mental impasse.p  precodewith offset as    select     entity, orderdate, qty,     extract year from orderdate   2015  12       extract month from orderdate   9 as monthoffset,     array[]integer[] as values   from mydata  select   prodid, playgrddte,  oh my...  how do I load into my array from fcst codepre  pThe 2015 and the 9 are not really hardcoded  I put them there for simplicity sake for this example.p  pAlso, if my approach or my assumptions are totally off, I trust someone will set me straight.p

Therefore I am using the plugin from a hrefhttpjqueryvalidation.org relnofollowhttpjqueryvalidation.orga p  pMy update function and therefore the form is working. Also if I enter for example a password with 3 letters I get an error message so jQuery validation is working too.p  pMy problem is now, that I can submit the form EVEN if there are some issues like the passwords are not equal or the password is too short. The form gets submitted everytime when I click the submit button.p  pI am not good a jQuery but I read something about submitHandler and I tried it see my code below but it is not working.p  pCan someone tell me what my code should look like so that the form is only submitted if it passes the jQuery validation I do not want to change my php code if possible because I am using functions for inserting and updating my database. Would be great if someone can help me.p  precodeltphp      sessioninfogetSessionInfosid     gluseridsessioninfo[persid][0]     userdatagetUserInfogluserid,0        if isset POST[submit]           contentarraypasswordgtcryptpwdnew1         updateUserInfogluserid,content          ifupdateUserInfogluserid, contentTRUE         msgsuccess Your password was changed successfully          else          msgerror ERROR Your password could not be changed caused by an error Please check and try again...                     print ltdiv classwidgetboxgt     print ltdiv classwidgetheadergt     print lth5 classwidgettitlegtYou can change your Password herelth5gt     print ltdivgt     print ltdiv classwidgetbodygt     print ltdiv classwidgetmaingt     print ltform classformhorizontal namechangepwd idchangepwd action.index.php methodpostgtn     print ltinput typehidden namefunc valuechpwdgtn     print ltinput typehidden namesid value.sid.gtn     print ltdiv classformgroupgt     print ltlabel forinputName classcolsm4 controllabelgtYour IDltlabelgt     print ltdiv classcolsm6gt     print ltinput typetext classformcontrol nameyourid idyourid placeholderYour ID valuegluserid readonlygt     print ltdivgt     print ltdivgt     print ltdiv classformgroupgt     print ltlabel forinputOldPassword classcolsm4 controllabelgtYour old Passwordltlabelgt     print ltdiv classcolsm6gt     print ltinput typepassword classformcontrol namepwdold idpwdold placeholderEnter your current Passwordgt     print ltdivgt     print ltdivgt     print ltdiv classformgroupgt     print ltlabel forinputNewPassword classcolsm4 controllabelgtNew Passwordltlabelgt     print ltdiv classcolsm6gt     print ltinput typepassword classformcontrol namepwdnew1 idpwdnew1 placeholderEnter your new Passwordgt     print ltdivgt     print ltdivgt     print ltdiv classformgroupgt     print ltlabel forinputRepeadPassword classcolsm4 controllabelgtRepead your new Passwordltlabelgt     print ltdiv classcolsm6gt     print ltinput typepassword classformcontrol namepwdnew2 idpwdnew2 placeholderEnter your new Passwordgt     print ltdivgt     print ltdivgt     print ltdiv classformgroupgt     print ltdiv classcolsmoffset5 colsm4gt     print ltbutton typesubmit namesubmit valuesubmit classbtn btnwarning btnlg btnblockgtChange Passwordltbuttongt     print ltdivgt     print ltdivgt     print ltformgt      ifissetmsgsuccess echo ltdiv classalert alertsuccessgt lta href classclose datadismissalertgtamptimesltagt.msgsuccess. ltdivgt      ifissetmsgerror echo ltdiv classalert alertinfogt lta href classclose datadismissalertgtamptimesltagt.msgerror. ltdivgt       print ltdivgt     print ltdivgt     print ltdivgt      print ltscript src.bootstrapassetsjsjquery.validate.jsgtltscriptgt     print ltscript src.bootstrapassetsjsadditionalmethods.jsgtltscriptgt  gt          ltscript typetextjavascriptgt             changepwd.validate                     errorElement div,                     errorClass helpblock,                     focusInvalid false,                     ignore ,                     rules                          pwdold                              required true,                             pwdoldtrue                         ,                         pwdnew1                              required true,                             minlength 5                         ,                         pwdnew2                              required true,                             minlength 5,                             equalTo pwdnew1                                               ,                      highlight function e                          e.closest.formgroup.removeClasshasinfo.addClasshaserror                     ,                      success function e                          e.closest.formgroup.removeClasshaserror.addClasshasinfo                         e.remove                     ,                      errorPlacement function error, element                          ifelement.isinput[typecheckbox]  element.isinput[typeradio]                              var controls  element.closestdiv[classcol]                             ifcontrols.findcheckbox,radio.length gt 1 controls.appenderror                             else error.insertAfterelement.nextAll.lbleq0.eq0                                                  else ifelement.is.select2                              error.insertAfterelement.siblings[classselect2container]eq0                                                  else ifelement.is.chosenselect                              error.insertAfterelement.siblings[classchosencontainer]eq0                                                  else error.insertAfterelement.parent                     ,                      submitHandler function form                      .postindex.php, changepwd.serialize                     ,                      invalidHandler function form                                                ltscriptgt codepre

Hourly employees are paid 15.00 per hour and commission based employees are paid  10 of the value of their sales figure. In the class you are required to appropriately  plan for a earnings method double earnings and ensure that the method must be implemented in  subclasses.  Create a HourlyEmployee class and a CommissionEmployee class that are derived from Employee. In each of these classes, create an overridden method named earnings.
