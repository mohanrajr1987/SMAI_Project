Positive 2884 pI am working with an old Enterprise app which uses EJB 2.1. The app was build in 2000s using Eclipse and XDoclet 1.2.3. p  pThe app consist of 1 Enterprise Application Project named codeAppEarcode, 1 EJB Project named codeAppEjbcode, 1 EJB Client Project named codeAppEjbClientcode, 1 Utility Project named codeAppSrccode and 1 Dynamic Web Project named codeAppWebcode. p  pThe codeejbjar.xmlcode is located in codeejbModuleMETAINFcode folder of codeAppEjbcode project and points to codeAppEjbClientcode project by having this entry p  precodeltejbclientjargtAppEjbClient.jarltejbclientjargt codepre  pI upgrade the app to Eclipse Kepler My workspace is codeDWORKWORKSPACEeclipsejeekeplercode. But the issue I am having is XDoclet Plugin is now setting wrong ejbclientjar in ejbjar.xml. This is how it is setting nowp  precodeltejbclientjargtAppSrc.jarltejbclientjargt codepre  pSo somehow the XDcolet plugin is now thinking that codeAppSrccode is the EJB Client Project instead of codeAppEjbClientcode.p  pI investigated a bit and find that the XDcolet plugin runs the ant script codetempAnt.xmlcode which is located in code.metadata.pluginsorg.eclipse.jst.j2ee.ejb.annotations.xdocletcode folder of the workspace. That folder also has a codebuild.propertiescode file which has 2 properties related to the EJB Client Modulep  blockquote   pejb.dd.clientjarAppSrc.jar br   ejb.client.module.srcDWORKWORKSPACEeclipsejeekeplerAppSrcsrcp blockquote  pI thought I just need to change them in codebuild.propertiescode file to point to right EJB Client so I change them this wayp  blockquote   pejb.dd.clientjarAppEjbClient.jar br   ejb.client.module.srcDWORKWORKSPACEeclipsejeekeplerAppEjbClientejbModulep blockquote  pSave the codebuild.propertiescode file and then do clean and build the whole workspace again. p  pBut still got the same wrong ejbclientjar in ejbjar.xml.p  pCheck the codebuild.propertiescode file in code.metadata.pluginsorg.eclipse.jst.j2ee.ejb.annotations.xdocletcode folder and it was reverted back by removing my changes.

Positive 2884 pI decided to use TomEE OpenEJB in my Junit test simply because IBMs EmbeddedEJBContainer is too limited. For example, it doesnt support MDB.p  pSo, I added a number of dependencies into my Maven POM.xml and got all necessary OpenEJB jars into my test code. In the BeforeClass method I created the EmbeddedContainer p  precodetestEJBContainer  EJBContainer.createEJBContainer codepre  pAnd this was successful. So, I thought the EJB annotation for injection would also work. But it didnt. Then I went on to interrogate the JNDI contexts used by OpenEJB. I found my EJB reference was bounded in the following subcontexts like p  pjavaglobalMyModuleMyEJBcom.company.dept.MyEJB   and javaglobalMyModuleMyEJB   p  pSo, they were there. However, the EJB annotation injection failed. So, I went on to search for tomcat annotation implementation for the EJB annotation method. I wasnt able to find that. p  pWondering what may be wrong here. A few things I can think ofp  ol liThe jar containing the EJB annotation for OpenEJB is not called. That is, some other jar implementing javax.ejb.EJB intercepted tomcats call.li liThe subcontext name is wrong.li ol  pI wanted to bind the MyEJB reference myself to the JNDI context for the injection to work but not able to match up the actual subcontext name.

Positive 2884 pIm currently struggling with getting remote EJB invocation to work on wildfly 8.x and 9.x. p  pIn detail its about remote invocation from a standalone client application not from another app server using the EJB Client API approach.

Positive 2884 pI studied that Tomcat is a web server and a servlet container which ofcourse could not support the applications of full JEE i.e for example applications with EJB and so.p  precode   But I heard that Tomcat 8 has new features that support EJB applications also. I would like to know if it is true or not. Is it possible to deploy EJB applications in tomcat version 8     If so, from which version of tomcat, are EJB applications being supported And if tomcat also supports EJB applications then what advantages does JBoss or WildFly have over Tomcat versions that support EJB     Could anyone please suggest with proper reply Thanks in advance. codepre

Positive 2884 pI have been reading lately about safe publication of Java objects e.g. here a hrefhttpshipilev.netblog2014safepublicconstruction relnofollowhttpshipilev.netblog2014safepublicconstructiona. p  pUntil now I was trusting EJB container without questions when relying on container managed concurrency. p  pNow Im wondering  1 how an EJB container can make sure that the EJB itself is published safely  2 how an EJB container can make sure that objects created by its EJBs are published safely e.g. EJB instance vars p  pE.g. stateless session bean can be accessed by different threads over time Im not necesseraly saying simultaneously, so unsafe publication is a potential issue. p  pFor 1, I roughly see possibilities, e.g. by wrapping the EJB and using some volatile accesses to garantuee total order. p  pFor 2, I dont see how EJB container can enforce it.  Maybe it is forbidden by the EJB 3.1 spec to keep instance variables in the EJB if it can be accessed by different threads  Maybe the statement dont worry about concurrency in container managed EJB is not true, and I should use safe publication patterns including volatile andor final keywords in the class definitions of the classes used in my EJB instance vars p  pIm surpirsed I missed this fundamental problemacy for that many years as a Java developer. p  pRegards,  Larsp

Positive 2884 pI am using Weblogic 12c Application Server for running our business application.  The application needs to integrate in realtime with an external system that provides PublishSubscribe MOM API. p  pMy approach is to have a Singleton bean, initiated at start up and after a few seconds calls a Timeout method, which connects to the external system and gets into its infinite event loop as below.p  precode    whiletrue          event externalSystem.nextEvent     This is a blocking call by the way          process received event      codepre  pThis works fine but after 600 seconds, Weblogic container throws the 600 seconds StuckThreadMaxTime exception because it assumes the thread is stuck in Running state where in fact it is blocked by design and should never finish.p  pApart from implementing a full JCA adapter, what other options can I have in  making a blocking API call inside my session method without causing a timeout exceptionp  pPlease helpp  pMany Thanks, Salamp

Positive 2884 pIs there a way to check if the current transaction is committed or not in JPA entity listeners something like the followingp  precodeApplicationScoped public class EntityListener       Inject     private EventltEntityEventgt event     Inject     private EntityManager entityManager     Resource     private UserTransaction userTransaction      PostPersist     PostUpdate     PostRemove     public void onChangeEntity entity            This is only a piece of pseudo code.         if userTransaction.isComitted               Do something.                codepre  pEntity listeners in JPA 2.1 are treated as CDI beans that depend upon CDI injections and a transaction context along with CDI is available in entity listeners. Those injections are therefore possible in the entity listener with or without the annotation codeApplicationScopedcode. The JPA 2.1 specification states,p  blockquote   pThe persistence provider is only required to support CDI injection   into entity listeners in Java EE container environments. If the CDI is   not enabled, the persistence provider must not invoke entity listeners   that depend upon CDI injection.p      pWhen invoked from within a Java EE environment, the callback listeners   for an entity share the enterprise naming context of the invoking   component, and strongthe entity callback methods are invoked in the   transaction and security contextsstrong of the calling component at the   time at which the callback method is invoked.p      pFor example, if a transaction commit occurs as a result of the normal   termination of a session bean business method with transaction   attribute codeRequiresNewcode, the codePostPersistcode and codePostRemovecode callbacks   are executed in the naming context, the transaction context, and the   security context of that component.p blockquote  pDoes there exist a way to know whether a transaction is successfully committed or not in JPA entity listener so that a different action or no action at all could be taken accordinglyp  pI expect a transaction does not get finished in its entirely as soon as a commit occurs and hence, there should exist a way to see, if a commit occurs or not especially, I am looking for a way to simulate a transactionwide event i.e. an event triggering at the end of a transaction giving the status of the transaction whether the transaction is committed or rolled back.p  pUsing GlassFish Server 4.1  Java EE 7 having EclipseLink 2.6.0 JPA 2.1.p

Positive 2884 pI have written a stateless EJB as an interval timer class code calls codestartcode on it with parameters to start the timer, passing in start and interval parameters along with an action to be executed when the timer fires.p  pI have two places in my code where I want to use timers, a different timer in each case.  So I wrote p  precodeEJB  IntervalTimerEJBLocal timer1  EJB IntervalTimerEJBLocal timer2 codepre  pBut this gives me two references to the same timer.  I need it to be an EJB so that I can use the javax.ejb.Timer and related classes in it, so I cant just use the new operator and instantiate it myself.  Is there not a way to tell the system that I want a different instance in each variable herep  pIf it matters, the interface is declaredp  precodeLocal public Interface IntervalTimerEJBLocal codepre  pand the class itself is declared asp  precodeStateless public class IntervalTimerEJB implements IntervalTimerEJBLocal codepre  pThere are questions like this Ive found, but they all seem to involve wanting to configure different parameters, or to use different beans based on parameters.  I just want two different instances of one bean, the call to the method that sets up the timers contains the configuration I need.p
Positive 2884 pWe have a EAR containing some jars, an EJB module and a WAR module.

If we do the lookup like that it works. There is also an applications section that includes our EAR with the module and all the classes inside.p  pNow that our EAR can have different executions, and therefore different binary names, we wanted to use javaapp to skip the hardcoded AppName. To our surprise, even if the javaapp exists in the jBoss console JNDI listing, it throws all the time a NameNotFoundException.

Positive 2884 pEDIT I figured the first part of my question out myself  to avoid closing my question and opening a new one for the second part, i recycle this question and provide the link for accessing remote EJB ont he same applicationserver a hrefhttpsgithub.comPiotrNowickiearintercommunicationblobmasterearintercommunication.clientearintercommunication.client.ejbsrcmainjavacompiotrnowickiejbintercommunicationclientClient.java relnofollowgithub example, thanks to PiotrNowickiap  pI have a War and a ear. The Ear contains a Stateful EJB, using a PersistenceContext.EXTENDED for some databaseoperations. This Context is extended for access to Lazyfetched lists in Entities outside the Persistencebean.p  pThe WAR has a JAXRS RESTInterface, implemented using Stateless Sessionbeans, which also do simple operations on other datasources. they do not require an extended context, so they use regular CMT.p  pthe Beans in the WAR however need to call the EARS EJBs.p  pIf I just Merge the Projects into one EAR and inject the beans via EJB, the CMT cannot interact with the Extended PersistenceContext. This is expected, see JPA spec 7.6.3. Stateless beans attach a regular PersistenceContext to the transaction, which an extended context does not acceptp  pSo I split the two Services and now need a ServiceInterface for interaction.p  pMy Question isp  p1 Would remote EJBcalls SOLVE the TransactionProblem, or would the JBOSS behave like the Bean was Local and try to add the Extended persistencecontext to the local transaction  resulting in the same problemp  pThanksp  pBilldoorp
Positive 2884 pIve tried CDI injection and EJB injection of Stateless EJBs in a Rivr dialog. They dont work. Ive also tried JNDI lookup of the EJBs through the Global JNDI name but I get following error note I am using javaglobal but I get this messagep  pemA JNDI operation on a javacompenv name cannot be completed because the current thread is not associated with a Java Enterprise Edition application component. This condition can occur when the JNDI client using the javacompenv name does not occur on the thread of a server application request. Make sure that a Java EE application does not run JNDI operations on javacompenv names within static code blocks or in threads created by that application. Such code does not necessarily run on the thread of a server application request and therefore is not supported by JNDI operations on javacompenv names.emp  pIs there anyway I can inject or locate CDI Named or EJBs in a Rivr dialogp  pthanks Ignaciop

Negative 2884 pI have a project that Im currently working on but it currently only supports the .net framework 2.0. I love linq, but because of the framework version I cant use it.

Negative 2884 pSo Ive done the trivial warmup apps with GAE.  Now Id like to build something with a more complex directory structure.  Something along the lines ofp  precodesiteroot models controllers controller1 controller2 ... templates template1 template2 ... codepre  p..etc.  The controllers will be Python modules handling requests.  They would then need to locate Djangostyle templates in associated folders.  Most of the demo apps Ive seen resolve template paths like thisp  precodepath  os.path.joinos.path.dirnamefile, myPage.html codepre  p...the  file  property resolves to the currently executing script.  So, in my above example, if a Python script were running in controllerscontroller1, then the myPage.html would resolve to that same directory  controllerscontroller1myPage.html  and I would rather cleanly separate my Python code and templates.p  pThe solution Ive hacked together feels... hackyp  precodebasepaths  os.path.splitos.path.dirnamefile templatedir  os.path.joinbasepaths[0], templates codepre  pSo, Im just snipping off the last element of the path for the currently running script and appending the template directory to the new path.  The other nonGAE specific solutions Ive seen for resolving Python paths seem pretty heavyweight such as splitting paths into lists and manipulating accordingly.  Django seems to have an answer for this, but Id rather stick to the GAE API, vs. creating a full Django app and modifying it for GAE.p  pIm assuming anything hardcoded would be nonstarter, since the apps live on Googles infinite server farm.  So whats a better wayp

A text input field is less than satisfactory lt understatement because it ialwaysi hides the overflow. In every other browser, a singlerow textarea works exactly as I want. I vehemently disagree that what I want is a usability problem. Unfortunately, the way it behaves in Firefox iisi a usability problem.p  pEdit turns out theres a bug with my installation of Firefox. p
Negative 2884 pI just played around with the new Delphi 2009 ribbon, added a few pages, groups and actionclients large buttons to it.

Negative 2884 pI have a newssystem where you can rate News with 1 to 5 stars. In the Database i save the count, the sum and the absolute rating as int up to 100 for html output, so 5 stars would be 100 1 star would be 20percent. Now i have three toplists Best Rated Most viewed Most commentedp  pLast two ones are simple, but the first is kinda tricky. Before i took that thing over it was all a big mess, and they just put the 5 best rated news there, so in fact if there was a news rated 4.995 with 100k votes and another one with 5 stars at 1 vote, the better rated one is on top even if that is obv ridiculous. For the first moment i capped the list so only news with a  certain amount of votes like 10 or 20 can be in the list.p  pBut i do not really like that.

Negative 2884 pIm working with a clients proprietary ASP.NET app, to which we added a PHP wiki to a subdirectory on the same server. The PHP app authenticates against the cookies that the .NET app uses. This all works fine. p  pWhen you login to the .NET app and then visit the PHP app Dokuwiki, and then visit any page on the .NET app, it reports that the session is expired and asks you to log back in.p  pBoth apps generate cookies, but none of them conflict in name. I stripped out the code in the PHP app that authenticates against the cookie to make sure I wasnt causing the issue with the PHP authentication, but the issue persisted. p  pWith the exception of some frontend things, I have no control over the ASP.NET backend, but I did create a stray .ASPX page in one folder which successfully forces authentication if a user visits it. I created this page in a plaintext editor, not in Visual Studio, so it didnt generate any code behind files. If you visit this page after visiting the PHP app, it does not report the session as having been expired. p  pMy question is that Im trying to track down what is causing this behavior, first, and then looking at options for correcting it. Im sorry for the dearth of more technical detail  as mentioned, I only have limited access to the clients app. Any help would be very appreciated, and if any more information is needed to help troubleshoot, Ill gladly provide what I can.  p

Negative 2884 pquick question  I have my first view which is going to be the ONLY view in my application. Ive added a UITabBar to this view using Interface Builder. I am simply wanting to use this as a menu to control the contents of a scroll view. p  pFor example, the user clicks on the first icon in the UITabBar  I get its tag, then based on that, will add a subview to the scrollview. This is working ok....p  p...but, I have been viewing a few tutorials on tabbars and it seems that 99 of the time they are used to control views. I simply want it to return my tags. p  pSo my question is this is what I am doing ok Can it be used for simply returning a value rather than changing a view If this is commonOK practice, how on earth do I reference it p  pI can get the selected item tag, but cannot actually reference the uiTabBar to make the first button selected. In my .h file, I tried to specify an IBOutlet for the controller, but I cannot link this in IB.p  pthanks for any infop

Linked below is a SQL query that returns very quickly under 2000, but takes 20 minutes under 2008.

The version with the CASE statement is also contained in the linked archive.p  pId like to see if someone has an explanation as to why this is happening and if there may be a more elegant solution than using a CASE statement. While we can work around this specific issue, Id like to have a broader understanding of what is happening to ensure the rest of the migration is as painless as possible.p  pa hrefhttpinstallationexcellence.comdownloadsMSSQL2B20082BQuery2BIssue.zip relnofollowZip file with SQL statements and XML execution plansap  pThanks in advancep

Negative 2884 pSay, there is a bar that is styled at the bottom of the viewport, usingp  precodeposition fixed bottom 0 left 0 width 100 height 50px overflow hidden codepre  pand then there are 4 Divs inside it, each one floated to the left.  Each Div is about 300px wide or can be more depending on the contentp  pNow, when the window is 1200 pixel wide, and we see all 4 Divs, but when the window is resize to be 1180 pixel wide just 20 pixels less, then the whole 300px wide Div will disappear, because it is floated to the next line.p  pSo how can this be made so that, the Div will stay there and showing 280px of itself, rather than totally disappearp  pBy the way,  codewhitespace nowrapcode wont work as that probably has to do with not wrapping inline content.p  pI was thinking of putting another Div inside this Div, having a fixed width of 1200px or 2000px, so that all Divs will float on the same level in this inner Div, and the outer Div will cut it off with the codeoverflow hiddencode.  But this seems more like a hack... since the wide of all those Divs can be dynamic, and setting a fixed width of 1200px or 2000px seems like too much of a hack.p  pstrongUpdatestrong actually, is the hack a relatively simple solution, not having to deal with IE 6 or 7... especially if we know the bar wont be more than 2000px wide.p

Negative 2884 pI am having trouble fixing a bug in an existing ASP.NET MVC web site.p  pOne of the views has a series of text boxes where the user enters data. Each text box has some javascript attached to the blur event in order to post back to the server when the text is changed. More specifically the code is using the JQuery .ajax method to make these calls. This is in order to save temporary data to the session.p  pIn the same view there is also a save button which also posts data via AJAX in the click event. The problem I am having is that if the user clicks the save button when one of the text boxes has focus, the blur event gets triggered at the same time as the button click event and two ajax posts get called simultaneously. This results in unreliable behaviour.p  pI know that the current design isnt great but I am looking for the easiest solution. Is it somehow possible to queue these two events or is there another solution Thanks.p

The other tables have similar structure but are already propopulated with data. The IDs are autoincremental.p  pSO if we have lets say companies marked 11000 in table1 and companies marked 1500 in table 2.

Negative 2884 pWe are developing a multitenant application using NHibernate where all tenants share the same database.p  pOne option we considered was to use a tenant specific prefix for our database objects I believe this the same approach taken by Orchard.p  pThis would at least give us some kind of recovery model for tenant data and would mean we wouldnt have to include a tenantid filter on most of our queries.p  pSo my question  has anyone employed this strategy If so, how did you go about it.p  pSpecifically, can we use the same SessionFactory for all tenants and can we use NHibernate to generate a new set of tables for a new tenant at runtime is it safe to do so.p  pThanks Benp  p[Update]p  pThis was a worthwhile investigation but ultimately we decided that a shared schema was more suitable for our needs. Schema per tenant clearly offers better separation of tenant data but makes maintenance more difficult. Since our tenants are only storing small amounts of data, the thought of having 10 tables  1K tenants is a little offputting.  p

Negative 2884 pLet me exaplain you the complete situation currently I am stuck with in. p  pWe are developing very much complex application in GWT and Hibernate, we are trying to host client and server code on different servers because of clients requirement. Now, I am able to achieve so using JNDI. p  pHere comes the tricky part, client need to have that application on different Platform also, database would be same and methods would be the same, lets say iPhone  .Net version of our application. we dont want to generate Server code again because its gonna be the same for all. p  pI have tried for WebServices wrapper on the top of my server code but because of complexity of architecture and Classes dependencies I am not able to do so. For example, Lets consider below code.p  precode    class Document          ListltUsergt         ListltAccessLevelsgt       codepre  pDocument class have list of users, list of accesslevels and lot more list of other classes and that other classes have more lists. Some important server methods takes Class Document or any other as input and return some other class in output. And we shouldnt use complex architecture in WebServices. p  pSo, I need to stick with JNDI. Now, I dont know how can I access JNDI call to any other application p  pPlease suggest ways to overcome this situation. I am open for technology changes that means JNDI  WebServices or any other technology that servers me well.p  pThanking You,p  pRegards,p

Negative 2884 pI was wondering how computer would look if trinary logic was used. It seems like the bigger the base , the more memory can be utilized. Ill explain. Binary address with length of 32  allows you to represent 232 possible values. Trinary address   332 , which is  431439 bigger than the binary one .p  pIt seems like it is much better. Also , the hardware way of doing it could be done easly  2 means strong current, 1 means weak current , and 0 no current. Of course it is much more complicated, but the idea is simple. However , i couldnt find any reffrence to any new research or new computer using this kind of logic.p  pSo , my question is why not using 3 numbers logic  or any n number logic   n2   What is stopping us from doing that p

Negative 2884 pIve been trying to set up Vim autocompletion for Ruby code and have not been successful. I mean things work, but I would expect a better plugin or configuration to be available.p  pIve set up the rubycomplete plugin and it is doing a decent job, but nothing compared to an IDE like RubyMine. It was just a breath of fresh air once I installed it see what I was missing. It is well aware of syntax, context and usually shows only relevant possible options.p  pMaybe I just havent set things up correctly. Its been impossible to find a tutorial, blog post, good documentation on how to go about this especially one that is up to date. Sometimes you just find that there are different tools and setups and not much explanation on how to go about it.p  pIs there a community standard for this type of thing What are the best tools to achieve this Any good tutorial, source, clues on how to go about itp  pI keep hearing people say that they prefer Vim over an IDE like Rubymine and that they can achieve pretty much the same behavior on many aspects with the proper plugin configuration, but my experience has not been the same. I really want to keep using Vim since it is lighter and I love the editor, but productivity is the most important thing and Im wasting too much time reading blog posts from 3 and 4 years ago about how to set this up.p

Negative 2884 pI have a WCF service that stores and processes images. Consuming applications can download images by invoking codeBitmap Downloadint fileidcode, and can also modify them by invoking other methods such as codeBitmap CropBitmap image, x1, x2, y1, y2code, codeBitmap ResizeBitmap image, int heightcode and codeBitmap RotateBitmap image, float anglecode.p  pThe problem here is that when a client wants to call any of the three image manipulation methods above Crop, Resize, Rotate, they must first download it and then invoke the manipulative methods successively, each time sending the image back to the WCF service and then getting a new codeSystem.Drawing.Bitmapcode object as the return parameter.p  pThe question is, how can I avoid sending the image back and forth Is there a way I can invoke a variable number of methods through one method If Im still not clear enough, then this is what I want to do I know it isnt valid codep  precodeBitmap bmp  Download2, Resize500, 200, Rotate90.00 codepre

The correct request is getting sent and the correct response is being sent back.  I am not getting any issues when I run the app.  I have run through the Analyzer and I do not get any issues.p  pThe problem I have is that I am not able to get the response to print in the NSLog.

Negative 2884 pI recently bought a new computer so in the process of backing up to time capsule, reinstalling eclipse and reloading my project Eclipse came up with the usual import Foo cannot be resovled error. I added my codeWEBINFcode folder to the classpath, refreshed, cleaned etc to no avail. I decided to delete the project and DID NOT click the checkbox saying delete project contents on disc. I reset up the project using the sources from my server on a shared computer. Still having no joy I looked inside my classes folder to find it empty.p  pSo I ran to my server to find that indeed my classes folder is empty, I went to the trashcan to find no java or class files, I did a full search of my mac and my macbook to find no class or java files. The compiled classes are still working, but Im scared that theyll disappear on the next restart  does anyone have any clue how to get my class source code back They represent over a year of work. I had version control but only on this computer.p

Negative 2884 pI am attempting to bind to a checkbox that has the ThreeState propety set to True. We want to be able to return a null if the CheckState is indeterminate without writing an event handler for each checkbox. This particular form has more than 20 checkboxes on it.p  pI have attempted to bind to the CheckState, but the indeterminate state does not return the null and locks the form up. Binding to the checked property returns a True when the checkbox is in the indeterminate state. Also, we are binding to class object properties, not to datatables.p  pThe team has two possible solutions that both have their drawbacks One is to create an additional property in the class for each boolean property that reads the CheckState and then sets the boolean property to null, true, or false accordingly. Painful to add all of these properties to all of the classes that have boolean fields that are not required fields.p  pSecond one is to create a custom control control that inherits the checkbox control and adds a new property that we can bind to with the boolean property of the class. Custom controls have their own problems as most know.p  pMy questions are  What am I overlooking  Is there a better way to implement this through databinding  What other methods have others usedp

Negative 2884 pI have an activity that uses ActionBarSherlock to show an action bar with navigation tabs.

I built a custom TabListener to achieve this, but it fires when the tab contents are initially rendered, not just when its manually selected.p  pI cant see a way to catch a traditional onClick event, so I assume I need to handle this in the TabListener and somehow distinguish the initial selection from a later manual selection, but how I could use a counter each time the tab is selected and only start the secondary activity if the counter is above zero, but that looks like an ugly hack.

Negative 2884 pHeres the setup I have a page, well call it A, which contains a button, well call it B. When a user clicks on B, a dialog opens C. C knows nothing about A or B once it has been created. p  pRight now, if a user doubleclicks on B, 2 or more Cs are created, which is not desirable. Since C knows nothing about B, I cannot disable the button because if a user presses Cancel in C, they will go back to A but B will still be disabled. I also cant save the page ID and limit C from being created that way because if a user does open C, clicks Cancel but then decides to open C again, they have to be able to do that.p  pHow can I stop the button from allowing more than one dialog to open, no matter how many clicks are done in successionp  pstrongEDITstrongbr I simplified too much in the above description, so heres a more in depth look. My codeToolbarcode class has a button called codereferencecode. When codereferencecode is clicked, a function is called on an entirely separate class, codeItemPickercode, which creates and displays the codeCreateConversationcode dialog. So, relating back to my original scenario, B doesnt know anything about C. I realize this is convoluted, but its not something I can change at the moment.p  pSomehow, I need to stop codereferencecode from making a second call to codeItemPicker.createAndShowcode if its clicked more than once and a codeCreateConversationcode dialog is already being opened. Also, there isnt a specific instance of codeItemPickercode in the codeToolbarcode class codecreateAndShowcode is a static method.p

The video was formatted as h264 wrapped in a mp4 container.p
Negative 2884 pOn the mysql docs it states that a codefloatcode column uses,p  precodefloatp  4 bytes if 0 lt p lt 24, 8 bytes if 25 lt p lt 53 codepre  pSo does this mean that if my column is expressed as belowp  precodefloat20, 6 codepre  pThen does codepcode equal to the amounts added So in the above example it would be a total size of 8 bytes as code20  6  26code.p  pOr does it mean that p is equal to 20 so that it would be a storage size of 4 bytesp
Negative 2884 pI am playing around with Tomcat authentication using Mysql. To facilitate this Im trying to model the Tomcat user data stored in the database. So I built a TomcatUser class.p  pIve stored the user name and password as Strings to just make life easy during testing. Security will be implemented later. And the users Tomcat roles are stored in an ArrayList so I can easily search and manage the users roles. And I have a few constructors for different scenarios.p  pOne of these is using a String VARARG to set however many Tomcat roles the user may have. I know that the parameters in a VARARG are stored in an array. In this case a String Array. I use the Collections.addAll method to add the contents of the VARARG array to the objects ArrayList.p  pIn the test class Im getting a NullPointerException from instantiating an Iterator from the objects , probably for some silly mistake on my part. But then Im new. Below is my code, for both the model class and the test. Can you tell me what Im doing wrong And any tips or advice in general would be appreciated.p  pThe model.p  precode   Class modeling user data for Tomcat.    package tomcat  import java.util.ArrayList import java.util.Collections  public class TomcatUser      String tomcatUserName Field to store Tomcat users name.

Negative 2884 pI am working with a project that was handed off to me and some of the building and linking concepts are new to me. I have a makefile, several assembly and C source files, an ELF file and binary file. When I load the ELF file onto my target, I am only able to stepthrough the C files, not the assembly files.p  pWhen I do a readelf on the ELF file, I see that the assembly .S files are missing from the symbol table. Likewise, my debugger RealView Debugger 4.1 doesnt list those .S files in the sources from image tree. I can see that some of the symbols from those files are included i.e. label names in my readelf output, but not the file type symbols themselves. Ive been going over the makefile to try to spot what may be failing to include them, but Im not sure what Im looking for. Can anyone please point me in the right direction Thanksp

Negative 2884 pI have a google map in my wordpress site, this map collects markers that are created from posts. To explain a little better, a user adds an item, that item is then placed on a map based on location and then a total inventory needs to be totaled. Each location should only generate one marker and the total inventory of that markers product. I have a few select dropdowns that let the use filter through the markers, and on change, updates an ajaxed php file, which builds a json file of the results, which the maps javascript then loops through and displays.p  pI have everything displaying, but, I cant get the markers to group by location and the total inventory to display. I think the ultimate solution would be to have the php script that generates the json file create one marker per location with the totals, eliminating the need for filtering with javascript. Here is my PHP that creates the JSON file.p  precodeltphp   Header include ........wpblogheader.php  global wpdb  wpdbgtshowerrors  eqtype  GET[eqtype] sql   SELECT wpposts.ID, wppostmeta.metavalue, wppostmeta.metakey FROM wpposts  LEFT JOIN wppostmeta ON wpposts.ID  wppostmeta.postid WHERE wpposts.posttype  equipment AND wpposts.poststatus  publish AND wppostmeta.metakey NOT LIKE yoastwpseo AND wppostmeta.metakey NOT LIKE edit  posts  wpdbgtgetresultssql arr  array foreach posts as post arr[item.postgtID][postgtmetakey]  postgtmetavalue    print postgtID.  .postgtmetakey.  .postgtmetavalue.ltbr gt endforeach  fp  fopen..jsonjsonequipment.json, w fwritefp, jsonencodearr fclosefp  gt codepre  pAnd it generates JSON output like this...p  precode          item111       eqtypeDump Truck,eqregionAlberta,eqtotalinventory123,      item112       eqtypeDump Truck,eqregionBritish Columbia,eqtotalinventory234,      item113       eqtypeDump Truck,eqregionBritish Columbia,eqtotalinventory23,      item114       eqtypeDigger,eqregionManitoba,eqtotalinventory23      codepre  pSo hopefully ive been clear enough, need to generate only 1 marker per location, with the total inventory of each location added up that filters by Type andor Region... but the grouping and totalling is what is really stumping me.

One row, and a total of related rows. The COUNT function is messing up my selections. In the subquery its not allowing me to select ON the current rankings.id of the outer query because the COUNT function reduces the results to one row before the filtering takes place. What I need is to somehow pass the id as a parameter in the subquerys WHERE clause. This is only one idea to get the desired results, but there might be a better way if you understand the application explained below.p  pLong Explanationp  pThie application allows users to rank opinions related to medical cases, for statistical purposes. There are two types of ranking which are computed the same way  prereference and postreference. That reflects how the user chose to rank the opinions before they saw the reference in the cases table and afterward. opinionlist wer are not using at this time.p  pThe rankings table stores one instance of a user going through the ranking process, and the rankingdata table stores the actual submitted data. The ranking page asks users to order opinions in order of preference, top being the best. This query is supposed to calculate the Collabograde score, which would be the amount people favored their opinion over others.p  pUsers who enter the app first login, then submit their own opinion to the case, then rank their opinion against the others already submitted. Everyone does the same. For example, lets say I just submitted my opinion and started ranking. There are 4 opinions including my own in the system and no other rankings yet although there would be one ranking per opinion typically. If I ranked my opinion at second best, then my Collabograde score would be 24. When user2 goes through the same ranking process and ranks my opinion at first best, then it becomes 38.p  pSo for the query, order is 0 for best and so on. The query is supposed to calculate the Collabograde score for one user and one case. The opinionid of the users submission in the case is retrieved in a previous query. I first try to get the position of that opinionid in all rankings, and then I get the total number of rankingdata rows for the currently selected rankings row. I use those values to calculate the result. So I am calculating one score per rankings row, and then averaging them together to create the score for the entire case.p  pGeniuses far and wide, what can I do p

In looking at the page output, it seems that the username field is a combination of the username from the first test and the second test.p  pFor example, the first test sets the username to nonexistent and the second test sets the username to test and this works if I run the tests individually.p  pIf I run them together, the username fields ends up with nonexistenttestp  pThis suggests that the webdriver does not reset  clear the page in between tests.p  pIs there some way to get it to reset itp  pI have currently worked around the issue by calling the clear method on each of the fields Before test.p  pAny assistance would be appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Negative 2884 pI have searched using many different terms and phrases, and waded through many pages of results, but I have remarkably not seen anyone else addressing, even asking, about, this issue. So here goes...p  pstrongUltimate Goalstrong Allow a user viewing a contentbased page may contain both text and images within a Windows Store app to share that content with someone else.p  pstrongDescriptionstrongbr I am working on taking a fair amount of content and making it available for browsingnavigating as a Windows 8WinRTWindows Store we need a consistent name here application. One of the desired features is to take advantage of the Share Charm, such that someone viewing a page could share that page with someone else.p  pThe ideal behavior is for the application to implement the Share Source contract which would share an email message that contained some explanatory text, a link to get the app from the Windows Store, and a deep link into the shared page in the application.p  pstrongSolutions Consideredstrongbr We had originally looked at just generating a PDF representation of the page, but there are very few external libraries that would work under WinRT, and having to include externally licensed code would be problematic as well. Writing our own PDF generation code would out of scope.p  pWe have also considered generating a Word document or PowerPoint slide using OpenXML, but again, we run up against the limitaions of WinRT. In this case, it is highly unlikely the OpenXML SDK is useable in a WinRT application.p  pAnother thought was to pregenerate all of the pages as .pdf files, store them as resources, and when the Share Charm is invoked, share the .pdf file associated with the current page. The problem here is the application will have at least 150 content pages, and depending on how we break the content down, up to over 600. This would likely cause serious bloat.p  pstrongWhere We Are Atstrongbr Thus we have come to sharing URIs. From what I can tell, though, the deep linking feature is only intended for use on Secondary Tiles tied to your application. Another avenue I considered was registering a protocol like, myspecialapp with the OS and having it fire up the application but that would require HKCR registry access, which is outside the WinRT sandbox.  p  pIf it matters, we are leaning towards an HTMLJS application, rather than XAMLC, because the converted content will all be in HTML and the WebView control in WinRT is fairly limited. This decision is not yet final, though.p  pstrongConclusionstrongbr So, is this possible, and if so, how would it be done or where can I find documentation on itp  pThanks,br Dave Parkerp
Negative 2884 pIm trying to use Matplotlib graphs as part of a cameraready submission, and the publishing house requires the use of Type 1 fonts only.p  pIm finding that the PDF backend happily outputs Type1 fonts for simple graphs with linear Y axes, but outputs Type3 fonts for logarithmic Y axes.p  pUsing a logarithmic yscale incurs the use of mathtext, which seems to use Type 3 fonts, presumably because of the default use of exponential notation.  I can use an ugly hack to get around this  using pyplot.yticks to force the axis ticks to not use exponents  but this would require moving the plot region to accommodate large labels like 10  6 or writing the axes as 10, 100, 1K, etc. so they fit.p  pIve tested the example below with the matplotlib master branch as of today, as well as 1.1.1, which produces the same behavior, so I dont know that this is a bug, probably just unexpected behavior.p  precodeusrbinenv python  Simple program to test for type 1 fonts.

Negative 2884 pI am developing a windows app where many code.rdlccode are there in a report folder of that project.

Ive tried adding a DB.disconnect line after the erb index line, but that didnt seem to affect the number of open connections.p  pIn addition, variable is called in the index.erb file, but I thought that the DB.disconnect statement in the after loop would take care of it. I even tried adding DB.disconnect to the end of the index.erb file, but that didnt seem to do anything.p  pSo, my question is Even with these precautions, why do the number of open connections continue to increase How do I fix it so that connections are closed once the calculation is completedp  pI should lastly note that the Herokuprovided PSQL database I am using supports a maximum of 20 open connections at once.p  pIf I need to provide more infocode, just let me know.p

Negative 2884 pSo my goal is to create some sort of simple chat functionality, and after a few days thats right days with no conclusive direction to go, Ive decided to post it here. Basically all I need is a global chat channel that any user on the site can open up and contribute. I think I should be using longpolling.  Id like to know if this can be accomplished using what I have now for the site Ruby on Rails framework, with Backbone.js on top, also using thin gem for server junk. The only question on SO close to what Im trying to accomplish is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3072480usingthinforlongpollingconnectionherea, but it is an incredibly vague answer. Keep it simple please, while I am pretty well off in most ruby and javascript stuff, this server side event business is basically brand new to me.p
Negative 2884 pIve been running into a few situations recently, where I have multiple views on the page that need to be backed by a single model.  This way, just by modifying the model, all of the relevant views will automatically update their appearance.  The problem is, in order to achieve this atm, I would need to write code that actively seeks out these models.  I will occasionally get lucky and have a model provided to me through an event handler, but usually this isnt the case.  Im looking for a good way to have a single instance of a model on the page at a time, and then just references to that model everywhere else.  How do people commonly handle this need  Backbonerelational handles it by keeping a central store using lawnchair.js, and I have heard of people using a single global collection to keep a registry of all of the models.p

Negative 2884 pI am trying to evaluate if password complexity rules are met using the NetValidatePasswordPolicy API. I have found many samples for this, but not one of them is working for me.p  pI have tried different ways of using the API with codeNetValidatePasswordResetcode and codeNetValidatePasswordChangecode Parameter but the result is always the same. p  pMy problem is, that the API only just tests for password length. If the password is too short I get the error 2245 which means the password is to short, but when I enter a longer password which does not meet the complexity rules at all I get a success code back instead of codePasswordNotComplexEnoughcode.p  pDid anyone get this API function work Please help and thanks for your support.p  pBelow is the code that doesnt work.

Negative 2884 pApologies in advance as Im sure this topic has no doubt been asked before but I couldnt find any post that answers my specific query.p  pBearing in mind that Im new to MVC this is where I have got to.  Ive got a project developed under VS 2010 using the MVC 3 framework.  Ive got a search page which consists of 6 fields and a nested model which itself holds around 3 fields.p  pI can successfully post all this data back to itself and the data is successfully passed as a model and back agian so the fields keep the data which the user has supplied.p  pBefore I move on to actually using this search criteria on another view a thought hit me.  I want to keep this search criteria, and possibly even the search results in memory for the duration of the users session.  p  pThe reasoning behind this is simply to save my users time byp  pa negating the need to keep reinputting their search criteria regardless of how they enter or leave the search pagep  pb speed up the user experience by presenting the search results more quicklyp  pThe later isnt as important as the first requirement.p  pIve done some google searches and indeed had a look through this site on similar topics.  From what Ive read using sessions which I would typically use if developing a PHP site is a no no.  From the reasons Ive read as to why you shouldnt use sessions seem valid and Im happy to go along with it.p  pBut now Im left in a place where Im scratching my head wondering to myself what exactly is best practice to achieve this simple goal that could be applied to similar situations later down the line in the project.p  pI also looked at the OutputCache method and that didnt behave as I expected it to.  In a test I set the timeout for 30 seconds.  After submitting a search I clicked the link to my search page to see if the fields would autopopulate, they didnt.  But then clicking the search button the values in the cache were retrieved.  I thought I was making progress but when I tried to submit a new value the old value from the cache came back i.e. I couldnt actually change my search criteria with the cache enforced.  So Ive discounted this as an avenue to explore.p  pThe last option seems to suggest the use of cookies as the most likely candidate, but rightly or wrongly I feel this isnt the best solution.  I would have thought the MVC 3 design pattern would have an easier and recommended method of persisting values.  Im sure there is but Ive just not discovered it yet.p  pI have started to use JQuery and again this has been mentioned but Im not sure this is right direction to take either.p  pSo in summary my question really comes down to what is considered by the wider community as best practice for persisting data in my situation.  Effiency, scalability and resiliancy is paramount as Ill have a large global user base that will end up using this web app.p  pThanks in advancep  pPetep

Negative 2884 pMy question is less specifically looking for ideas to a solution, and more for a sanity check of my own solution since its been a while at least two major revisions since Ive worked with ADODBs in Excel VBA.p  pSo the situation is this. Im creating an Excel report for a user who wants to access large chunks of a database view that is much too big to fit in memory. The user needs to be able to access ALL of the view, so hardcoded filters are out of the question. Unless Im missing a more elegant solution, what they need is to be able to dynamically control the filters on the connection in the form of a generated SQL statement, which feeds into the pivotcache and then tells the pivottable to refresh.p  pI created a refresh button which brings up a Form that has all the filters the user commonly needs. The user enters the filter values, I parse and validate them, form a proper SQL statement from the values. Then I run into a problem when I do thisp  precodethis has to be dynamic becuase Im distributing to multiple users, using different testingproduction databases on different workstations. mypivottable.PivotCache.Connection  ODBC amp driver amp myserver amp myuser amp trusted amp app amp workstationid amp databse  this also has to be dynamic becuase of the sql filters mypivottable.PivotCache.CommandText  sql codepre  pSo I push the button and it works after setting these properties the pivottable automatically refreshes because it knows theres new data behind the cache, and fetches the query results under the new criteria.p  pThe problem is that when I look in the external datasource listing, every time I change these properties it creates a new connection and doesnt clean up after itself. After 100 uses, there are 100 connections laying around, 99 of them unused. If I delete ALL the connections, then it irreversibly breaks the pivottable.p  pIs there a better way to do this Is there a programmatic way to clean up only unused connectionsp

Negative 2884 pI wonder if anyone has any advice for me, essentially were using a textbox to do a search but its causing some problems.  We have a listbox with rowsource set to the equivalent of select  from tblSearch where searchField Like em amp [Forms][frmNames][txtSearch].[Text] amp emp  pThis query has Max Rows set to 25 and all the tables are linked tables to SQL Server.  On the On Change event of the search textbox it runs a requery on the listbox and everything seems to be working sweet as a nut, except the database is hanging for users every day or so which is driving me nutsp  pHaving looked into this essentially what Ive boiled it down to is that Access is sending the select statements to SQL on the same server but not waiting for each query to complete and processing it before moving on.  So before Access gets the response back from the server the user types the next character and it fires a new query to SQL.  In SQL Server then you find hung queries with resource wait ASYNCNETWORKIO which I understand is the client not consuming the data from SQL Server.p  pWhat Ive had to do is change the event being used to requery from On Change to afterupdate which really takes away from the whole user experience of having a sort or Google Instant search experience as they have to type and hit Enter before seeing results, not nicep  pSo thats the issue, just wondering if anyone has any suggestions, Ive run out of ideas nowp

Negative 2884 pI need to check a folder for some files of a certain type, then add them to an array, and print and delete them one by one. If a new file is added during the process, it will just get added to the printing queque. Im trying to monitor if a file is created every 1 second. To make this Im using a FileSystemWatcher with a Timer. Im trying to binding the 2 event functions togheter but I get weird errors when trying. Im doing this in a Form application, and I saw those 2 namespaces for the first time today, and I know nothing about multithreading, background threads or difference between System.Threading.Timer an System.Windows.Forms.Timer and which one is best for this particular situation, so I might need some quick clarification about this too, if the problem gets too specific on these subjects.p  pBasically the code is this one its part of a bigger program, so Ill try to just stick the problem related code, also, dont mind the extra using namespace which are part of the whole project.

Negative 2884 pemNote I know codegit push fcode questions are common, but I really couldnt easily find answers to this specific question anywhere. I want a comprehensive answer, not just something that somewhat solves my problem. At the end of the question I propose a solution myself.emp  pIve pushed some changes to a branch I should not at work. I have already codegit revertcodeed the changes, but one of the team coordinators wanted me to actually codegit reset ltold commitgt ampamp git push fcode so that the history wouldnt be cluttered by the revert commits. Few people use that branch, so we thought it was worth the risk.p  pIt worked, but Im afraid that people who had already pulled my commits may accidentally fastforward the remote branch again, since the history hasnt diverged yet I just resetted to an old commit, but didnt make any other commit on top of that one.p  pI noticed that if I codegit reset ltold HEAD commitgt ampamp git statuscode, Git says its a couple commits ahead of codeoriginltbranchgtcode, so Im sure if I codegit pushcode again, Git will just fastforward it.p  pcodegit pullcode says the repo is uptodate and doesnt backtrack which I dont think it should, anyway. But then, what should I do to make sure everyone backtracks to the right HEAD on codeoriginltbranchgtcode and work from there Do I need to ask everybody to codegit reset originltbranchgtcode before resuming work on that branch I really wanted something easier and less errorprone they might forget to do it.p  pI know I shouldnt be git resetting a branch on a shared repo, but you know how it is... Sometimes you just feel adventurous, or maybe your superior asked you to do it and you know its wrong but it could be an educational experience anyway Pp

Negative 2884 pIm trying to create a Client in java to transfer files over UDP using a GobackN sliding window. Im using a TftpPacket, but thats not relevant for the question. My problem its how am I able to make the acknowledge control. Examplep  pHave a file that is divided into 15 segments, window with length 10. So first it will send 10 segm, but package 2 its lost so the client sends 10 segm and the the server only acknowledged the first one, so client sends segm 11 and stops. After the timeout the client send again but the window this time will be defined from segm 2 to segm 11 10 segm window and so on.p  pMy problem its that Im not able to understand how to control the window so it blocks on segm 11 if the last ack received was 1 and resend the whole window after the timeout.p

Negative 2884 pI am working on an application for both iOS and Android and I am getting very different results in my C code. The issue I am having is that entering a function is stomping a member variable is a derived class. As an examplep  precodeint main     A arrayOfA  new A[10]    for int i  0 i lt 10 i           arrayOfA[i]  new D         return 0  class A    Original code here. After this is the added function and member variable that breaks it  public    virtual u32 GetterFunction  0  protected    u32 ProblemVariable   class B  A  public    Bu32 index  ProblemVariable  index     virtual u32 StompedGetter  0    virtual u32 GetterFunction  return ProblemVariable      void Initialize           u32 sometimesBunkNumber  StompedGetter      protected    u32 StompedVariable   class C  A  public    virtual u32 GetterFunction  return 0    class D  B     B  Initialize     virtual StompedGetter  return StompedVariable    class E  B     virtual StompedGetter  return 0   codepre  pNow then, the issue here is that everything works fine UNTIL I put the member variable and virtual getter in class A. When the getter is called it gives a bunk number at random times. It might work 2 times and then it will return a bad number obviously grabbing from a bad place in memory. It doesnt matter if the function is virtual or not but it is the ideal solution. The worst part is that this compiles and works great on the iOS version but on Android it dies. Just as a clarification it runs until it initializes a class B in an array of class A. Sorry if this is very vague but any and all help is appreciated. Thanks in advancep

Hence mapping e.g.  to u would also be acceptable mapping by visual similarity. So is mapping codecode to codeucode as done by iconv see for instance a hrefhttpergoemacs.orgemacsemacszapgremlins.html relnofollowlink posted by Juanchoa.p  pThe methods shown in a hrefhttpergoemacs.orgemacsemacszapgremlins.html relnofollowthe link posted by Juanchoa are technically working solutions. However, is there a emformal standardem for such a mapping or at least a mapping used as a quasistandard Ideally it would also include for instance phoneticsbased transcriptions for nonlatin characters.

Negative 2884 pWe have an application which is clustered and has a cache at its core. The cache is based on calculated data, build up from the underlying database which is replicated too. It is used for fast lookup on streaming data, to make routing decisions on the fly.p  pSince the data on which the cache is calculated, can be changed from any of the nodes in the cluster, we are thinking of making the cache replicated too so that we do not have to listen to replicated changes coming in from other nodes in the system, in a database specific manner. p  pWe have identified ehcache  infinispan  hazelcast with nearcache being the other contendors  as the possible cache implementation. So far so good. p  pWhat I need to know is how this cache will be repopulated when the individual nodes or the entire application restarts. All the data that a node requires is present in the underlying database. So can each node simply load the data from its database and populate the cache after restarts How will the cache then bring the cluster nodes to a single state p  pI understand that there are disk persisted caches  is that the way to go with ehcache I did not want to use that as a first option since the single point of all the data is the database and that is the central authority for deciding which is the right data. p  pIs there a way an app can reload the cache with all the data at restart and have all the caches do the same and sync up the deltas I kind of think this is a hard thing to do and might not be viable since all the nodes will not have send all their keys back and forth. But wanted to be sure and wanted to know if there are any other strategies to handle this scenario.p

Negative 2884 pSay Ive got a simple inheritance chain where codeEmployeecode is the abstract base class and codeCheckoutcode and codeManagercode inherit from it in this purely illustrative console app.  Now I want to have a method that will take in an object of type codeManagercode or codeCheckoutcode and return an integer amount of a bonus depending on the position in the company of the employee.  I had some initial thoughts on doing this, and would like to know potential longterm deficits or gains from each approach if this console app were to one day grow up to be a datadriven web application. p  ol lipUse an interface common to the inherited classes. My base class looks like p  precodeabstract class Employee              public int EmployeeId  get set          public string FirstName  get set          public string LastName  get set         codepre  pand my derived classes implement an interface designed to print employee information to the console called codeIPrintablecode and only has one method to do so.  Although this interface has nothing to do with giving bonuses I mocked up the following in the class with my codeMaincode method lives and the program runs fine.p  precodestatic int GiveBonusesViaInterfaceIPrintable i                      if i is Checkout                 return 1000             else                  return 2000            codepre  pIt seems to me that if I wanted to use an interface for this I should probably make another one specific to giving raises instead of riding the coattails on an alreadyimplemented interface but thats another question for another day. pli lipUse a static method in the base class likep  precodepublic static int GiveBonusEmployee e                      if e is Manager                 return 2000             else                 return 1000          codepreli lipMake an abstract method in the abstract base class and nave derived classes implement as they see fitp  precodeabstract class Employee fields and constructors  public abstract int GiveBonusesViaAbstractMethodEmployee e   codepreli ol  pThis seems to be the worst idea to me because there will have to be a method in each derived class that takes in a parameter of codeIPrintablecode or codeEmployeecode type and in the Manager class wed have to test if the employee codeisacode Manager.  p  pAre 12 equally as scalable and managable for a longterm web application  Is option 3 really as bad as I made it outp

I would like to have, in a similar lookandfeel, an extra line in the tooltip for codetotalcode.p  pI tried achieving this by adding an extra column named codeTotalcode which would have a value of 0, but a tooltip equal to the sum.

Negative 2884 pFirst of all what am I trying to dop  pI have an application to view images. It uses the canvas element to render the image. You can zoom in, you can zoom out, and you can drag it around. This part works perfectly right now.p  pBut lets say I have an image with a lot of text. It has a resolution of 1200x1700, and my canvas has 1200x900. Initially, when zoomed out, this leads to a rendered resolution of 560x800.p  pMy actual drawing looks like thisp  precodedrawImagesrc, srcOffsetX, srcOffsetY, sourceViewWidth, sourceViewHeight, destOffsetX, destOffsetY, destWidth, destHeight codepre  pSmall text on this image looks really, really bad, especially when compared to other image viewers e.g. IrfanView, or even the html lt img  element.p  pI figured out that the browsers interpolation algorithm is the cause of this problem. Comparing different browsers showed that Chrome renders scaled images the best, but still not good enough.p  pWell I searched in every corner of the Interwebs for 45 hours straight and did not find what I need. I found the imageSmoothingEnabled option, imagerendering CSS styles which you can not use on canvas, rendering at float positions and many JavaScript implementations of interpolation algorithms those are strongfarstrong to slow for my purpose.p  pYou may ask why I am telling you all of this to save you the time to give me answers I already know p  pSo is there stronganystrong good and fast way to have better interpolation My current idea is to create an image object, resize this because img has good interpolation when scaled and render it then. Unfortunately, applying img.width seems only to affect the displayed width...p  pMany thanks in advance for your answers  p  pstrongUpdatestrong Thanks to Simon, I could solve my problem. Here is the dynamic scaling algorithm I used. Notice that it keeps the aspect ratio, the height parameter is only for avoiding more float computing.

Negative 2884 pI am seeing a crash in following piece of code. This method is waiting for a thread to complete which was created using boostthread api .

The main option across the navigation bar will have a page value and the first option on the subnavigation will be the same page but with a value on the end of the URL primarily to toggle between javascript. I have tried encoding the page and comparing it to shorten processing time however on some of the sites the URL is put into a form field.p  precodeExample  Option1  www.example.compage1  first opt  www.example.compage1t1  second opt  ww.example.compage1t2 codepre  pIt wont be possible to strip off the additional tags from what it seems as some sites use these values solely whereas other pages use JS. As the URLs are technically different, is there a way to check if the pages are the same even though they are on different URLsp

Negative 2884 pI am using an FTP client in a seperate thread. The FTP client uses a job list to updownload files to a connected server. If the thread wants to communicate with my main thread it will use an event queue. The thread will create an event, put it into the queue and then post a windows message to my main thread telling me that there are new events in the queue. The main thread then fetches the latest event from the queue and removes it. The queue is held in the thread object but I am using a lock to make it threadsafe. I created a function within my main thread which is listening for messages from the FTP thread. I also registered a handle for this method via AllocateHwnd so that the thread is posting its messages excactly to the listening method of my main thread.p  pNow I want to know if the following scenario is possiblep  pI destroy the thread. Right before it gets destroyed the thread will post a windows message to the main thread because there is a new event. The windows message however has some delay for whatever reason. Now the thread gets destroyed and the thread object is gone. Of course, the event queue is also gone. The main thread now receives the delayed windows message telling him that there is a new event in the queue. It tries to fetch the queue which will result in an invalid pointer operation since there the queue and the thread object have been freed.p  pTo avoid this problem, I implemented a check into my message listening method. Right before I access the event queue from the thread I will check if the thread still exists. If yes, then I access the event queue, if no, then I will simply drop the message.p  pHowever, what if the thread gets destroyed right after I checked it, but before I access the queue. The sequence would be like thisp  ul liCheck if thread existsli lithread gets destroyed NOWli liAccess event queueli ul  pCan this scenario still happen I know that this does sound like a very specific and tiny scenario since the thread would have to get destroyed right between those two commands in order to fail but I want to make sure that I do not access the event queue when the thread is actually not existing anymore.p  pI hope I could explain my problem well enough. Thanks in advance for any provided answers.p

Negative 2884 pI have a fragmented structure in memory and Id like to access it as a contiguouslooking memoryview. Is there an easy way to do this or should I implement my own solutionp  pFor example, consider a file format that consists of records.

It would make implementing the higher level structure easier if it could see its own fragmented memory location as a simple contiguous array of bytes.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pIt seems that python supports this segmented buffer type internally, at least based on a hrefhttpdocs.python.org2.7capitypeobj.htmlbufferobjectstructures relnofollowthis part of the documentationa.

The new buffer protocol  specified in a hrefhttpwww.python.orgdevpepspep3118 relnofollowPEP 3118a  offers a new way to represent buffers. This API is more usable in most of the use cases among them, use cases where the represented buffer is not contiguous in memory, but does not support this specific one, where a one dimensional array may be laid out completely freely multiple differently sized chunks in memory.p

I have scaled down the backuprestore operation to only the simplest database, the only way I could then get it to work is if I were to create a new db, edit the settings to repoint that db to the restored database directory.p  pWhile that might work for the test db, thats not gonna work with production data that has multiple bundles including encryption  short of copy and pasting that settings from production to the lower environment which would be a terrible hack.p  pp  pWhen working with a fresh copy of raven 2750, there was actually a Restore Database menu from the Tasks tab, but upon

Negative 2884 pI have a basic abstract class BC.p  pI have an abstract class X that extends BC. X has some private variables.p  pI search for a possibility to use a method, defined in BC and therefor inherited into X that can list ALL variables of X, including the private ones.p  pAs far as I understand, that is impossible unless I transfer the methods from BC into a trait using this trait in the BC and X class definitionp  pIs there any other solution that allows me to have the methods defined in BC directlyp

Negative 2884 pIm working on an existing project that was recently converted to use Maven.  Its a multimodule EAR project for Websphere Application Server 7.0.p  pOur current development environment is Eclipse Juno with the latest versions of m2ewtp plugin and Websphere 7.0 Development Tools from the marketplace. p  pWe want to be able to use Eclipse for debugging and testing on a Websphere server running locally, so weve been trying to use the m2ewtp plugin to take advantage of Eclipse features. Weve been dealing with all sorts of problems getting this to work, but I have one issue Im struggling to deal with in particular right now.p  pThe projects in our workspace are targeted to the Websphere Application Server server runtime.  This gives the project access to the Websphere runtime libraries. Also, in the Project Explorer view, there is a container inside the project labeled Websphere Application Server 7.0.  If you expand that container, it displays the jars in the libraries.  p  pNow comes the tricky part.  As soon as you enable the Maven nature on the project, that Websphere Application Server container in the project is empty.  We start getting errors from missing classes from the runtime libraries, so we know that the projects no longer have access to the jars from the library.p  pThe maven builds work fine, and we can load the generated EAR through the servers administrative console and it runs, but we would have to debug manually with server logs.  Weve tried various combinations of versions of Websphere tools, m2e, and Eclipse. I didnt have this issue working with an earlier version of the Websphere tools, but it wasnt fully compatible with the most recent version of the m2e plugin.  But we need the most recent version of the m2e plugin to configure the Eclipse projects correctly, it seems.  If the projects arent configured correctly Eclipse cant load it on the server for testingdebugging.p  pIs there somewhere I can configure the server runtime library manually So far the best I can do is just add the required jars directly to the classpath.  As soon as I remove the Maven nature, it goes back to normal. But of course we no longer have the Maven dependencies. p

Negative 2884 pUp until recently we used custom exceptions with an inbuilt errorcode to allow us to communicate errors or problems we dont like around our systems.p  pHowever, I was shown a different method where you have a publicly exposed collection of errors on each class that you populate if there was a problem. The calling method then calls myObject.IsValid which sees if the error collection has any entries to check if the call was successful. If it wasnt then you can iterate through the error collection to see what went wrong. As far as I understand this is how MVC works with the ModelState.p  pThe claim was this was the more efficient approach to error communication as there is an overhead to throwing exceptions.p  pIs this claim true Is there a third option that is even better than the above What is the correct way to communicate errors and problems around a .NET applicationp

Negative 2884 pI have a Node.JS based server. One of the functions of the server is to receive a photo from a mobile client and store it in the mongodb.

Below is the error generated by the server the user is authenticated and then the upload process fails, PUT v1addphoto.json command returns error code 400, but it seems that the remaining functions of the addphoto.json are still called  why and thus, this error is generated, since at the very end, the sendfailure function will set the header again.

Negative 2884 pI know this question was asked many times regarding the use of php sessions in RESTful SPIs, but the answer is usually that php sessions preserve the state across multiple request, thus are not stateless, and since I have doubts about this claim I would like to contradict it and receive good answersp  pIf I understand php sessions right, this is how they workp  ul liWhen a user requests a resource that involves session handling a session id is produced and provided to him.li liThe user is responsible to send this session id to the server for any subsequent requests, which is usually done by the useragent via cookies or by attaching a sessionid parameterbr to the url.li ul  pThus, no application state information is ever saved on the server, and php sessions ARE stateless, as the session id is saved by the client, not the server.p  pOf course, theres the session file that IS saved on the server, hence the preserved state. But what is the difference between saving info on this session file, or saving it in a database sessions or not, some data is saved on the server, and some of it or all of it is only relevant to a certain user or a group of users.p  pAssume a chess game for example. Assume all game logic is implemented in php files. Soldier positions are saved in a table. Player must identify somehow to tell the server what move to do next. Now assume soldier positions are saved in a session file. Player has to identify again, is this scenario any different than the db table scenariop  pEDIT Thanks for the good answers, they rise another question can sessionbased applications such as the chess game from last paragraph be implemented as a RESTful servicep

Negative 2884 pWe added some choice Cache.getOrElse statements in our Play 2.2.2 application to store some intermediate products of some rather CPU intensive calculations. Seemed like an easy win Several of these are rather complex case classes and we noticed that after implementing this we observed two things a the memory usage of the JVM goes up substantially b we get a bunch of warnings like the followingp  precode [warn] 200157  net.sf.ehcache.pool.sizeof.SizeOf The configured limit of 100,000      object references was reached while attempting to calculate the size of the object graph.   This can be avoided by adding stop points with IgnoreSizeOf annotations. Since the CacheManger or Cache ltsizeOfPolicygt elements maxDepthExceededBehavior is set to abort, the sizing operation has stopped and the reported cache size is not accurate.   If performance degradation is NOT an issue at the configured limit, raise the limit value using the CacheManager or Cache ltsizeOfPolicygt elements maxDepth attribute.   For more information, see the Ehcache configuration documentation. codepre  pMy initial thinking was that because we are storing these complex classes, that the Cache was sucking in other parts of the object that were required to fully reconstitute the object once returned out of the cache. So we created some more simple objects  stripping companion objects, and retyping any fields in the classes that are not Strings or Ints. But even really simple maps of strings seem to be storing a lot of objects and therefore I presume a lot of memory used in the Cache.p  pAn example that stores a map of stringsfrom a redis objectp  precodeval value  Cache.getOrElse[Map[String,String]]CachePicturesForFolios, expiration  840000       client.hgetAllBookmarksPhotos  codepre  pThis map of redis results we are storing has precisely 256 key  values and the jedis library returns this as a Map[String,String]. So why would this result in that warning of   100000 objects being calculated for the cache Performancewise this is a huge problem because the calculation of the cache size takes a long time and Im not sure setting the cache to ignore calculation is a wise choice when ehcache is being used extensivelyp  pWhat am I not getting about ehcache and how this works Do I need to do my own serialization of any object I want to put in the cache so that everything is forced to a single key  valuep

Negative 2884 pIve been looking for a solution for this for a while now and I still havent found it. Our app needs to poll a YouTube video object using codeplayer.getCurrentTimecode to drive some screen animations. Using the flash API this was great because we could poll the player at code40mscode intervals 25 FPS and get very accurate current player time values. We have now started to use the iFrame API which unfortunately does not allow anything near that level of accuracy. I did some research and it seems that because its an iFrame, a codepostMessagecode is used to expose the players state to the codeplayer.getCurrentTimecode call. Unfortunately this post message event is fired very infrequently  sometimes as low as 4 times a second.

Negative 2884 pFor demonstration purposes, say I have an email that goes out weekly that has red, green and blue image tiles in them. The email ask them to choose a colour. When the email recipient clicks on a colour, say red, they are taken to my ajax site and a message appears saying thanks for choosing red. The database is updated via ajax so that red is incremented by 1. The page also says that they can change their mind if they like, or simply close their browser. Below this message are the three coloured tiles to click.p  pIf the user decides they actually wanted blue and click that tile, the database decrements red by 1 and then increments blue by 1.p  pNow my issue comes with the user changing their mind. What I am doing is when the page loads and the database is updated with their choice, I am sending the unique rowid back to the page via ajax. That way if they change their mind, I simply send their new selection up to the server along with the original rowid. I decrement the original rowid by 1, and increment their new choice.p  pMy problem is this doesnt seem very secure as the rowid is visible to the browser and end user if they wanted to see it.p  pIs there a better way than this I do not want them to have to hit submit when the page first loads, I want the one click from the email to be all they have to do to register their vote. And then change their mind if they want, or just leave the page.p  pThis is a VERY simple example of what I am actually doing, but any advice would be appreciated.p

Negative 2884 pIll get right into the subjectp  pI have a server that works a music recommendation system  for some kind of application the server has a very large databasep  pSo i made a singleton constructor of the recommendation system. My problem is  the first time this constructor is being created it has to run a training data and it connects to the database a lot which is a time consuming operationp  pThis has to run only the first time according to my singleton object and then afterwards, itll be able to use the results of the constructor right awayp  pMy problem is that on the first HTTP request from my PC to the server, the explorer times out and the singleton object is never created on the serverp  pI think my solution would be in extending the wait time of the explorer until the server finishes computation and returns with result, however  if someone has a better solution id be greatly in his dept p  pI really need an easy applicable solution that requires minimal effort because the delivery deadline is closing up and i need to wrap the project as fast as possiblep  pThanks againp

Negative 2884 pI have an error scenario wherein im trying to read more bytes than actually present in the file. In synchronous case it fails and appropriate error is reported because we call waitFrObject and wait till the io is complete and test if readbytes  ToReadbytes. But in case of asynchronous we start reading , ignore IO peding status flage returned by ReadFile which is expected and continue our operation. So the error is actually not caught in asynchronous case. Now if i check wait for the IO to complete to check if readbytesToreadBytes then it wont be asynchronous anymore as we are waitng. So how do i deal with such a situation  Note Reading more bytes than actually present is one of the ways to make error reproduciblep  pIm using windowns ReadFile function for reading.p

Negative 2884 pI was hoping to use the C11 codethreadlocalcode keyword for a perthread boolean flag that is going to be accessed very frequently.p  pHowever, most compilers seem to implemented thread local storage with a table that maps integer IDs slots to the variables address on the current thread. This lookup would happen inside a performancecritical code path, so I have some concerns about its performance.p  pThe way I would have expected thread local storage to be implemented is by allocating virtual memory ranges that are backed by different physical pages depending on the thread. That way, accessing the flag would be the same cost as any other memory access, since the MMU takes care of the mapping.p  pWhy do none of the mainstream compilers take advantage of page table mappings in this wayp  pI suppose I can implement my own threadspecific page with codemmapcode on Linux and codeVirtualAlloccode on Win32, but this seems like a pretty common usecase. If anyone knows of existing or better solutions, please point me to them.p  pIve also considered storing an codestdatomicltstdthreadidgtcode inside each object to represent the active thread, but profiling shows that the check for codestdthisthreadgetid  activethreadcode is quite expensive.p

Negative 2884 pI want to ask the user to confirm the change of a CheckBoxPreference in the settings of my application. I tried to put an AlertDialog in both OnPreferenceClickListener and OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener but I did not succeed in CANCELLING the CheckBoxPreference change once the preference is clicked. Thanks for  your help.p  hr  pNathan, I tried the following 2 ideas p  p1 Implement OnPreferenceClickListener in PreferenceActivity like this p  precode    Override public boolean onPreferenceClickPreference preference           new AlertDialog.Builderthis         .setTitleMove Data to SD card         .setMessageThis will ......

This is just a workaround that consists in swapping back the box. This is not clean at all. I need to get the control before the change.p  p2 Implement OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener in PreferenceActivity with similar code in  onSharedPreferenceChanged but in this case the swapping back of the box value in setNegativeButton programmatically triggers a preference change event again and again. The only way to get rid of the confirmation dialog box is to choose YES.p  pIf there is no simple solution I am ready to extend CheckBoxPrefence but how Which method should I overridep

Negative 2884 pI am doing performance tests on an algorithm I wrote for parallel matrix multiplication in Java. I get the number of cpu cores from runtime, then divide the calculation loop between the available cores, using a thread pool. I measure the run times of the sequential and parallel version, then display the results in an excel chart. There I noticed a strange behavior img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comRIyhG.png altenter image description herep  pThis is a performance test of matrix multiplication of square matrices from size 50 to size 1500. The results are an average calculated from 10 runs. The measurements are indicated by dots on the lines and the lines themselves are smoothed. As you can see, the lines of the sequential and parallel functions cross two times. Actually, three times, but the first one is around the matrix sizes 6080, hence not visible in this chart. That is normal, since threads introduce overhead, so fast functions run better sequentially.p  pAre the other two intersections normal I have done multiple measurements in the 500700 region, this behavior seems prevalent.p  pThings I think could play part in this OS thread management, JVM thread management, some thread poolspecific behavior, Intel Hyper Threading since I have an intel i53210M cpu in my machine. However, what seems to be behaving irregularly to me, at least is actually the sequential algorithm. Notice how, until it hits a size of 650, it barely suffers any time penalty. Then it steepens abruptly at a size of 650. In comparison, the parallel curve seems pretty smooth.p  pI have checked the algorithms a few times, Im pretty sure they are bugfree. The results of the calculations are correct, thats for sure. My functions are measured in a double loop the outer one repeats the measurements for later averaging and the inner one increases the matrix size every step. Inside that, the source matrices are randomized, the sequential function is run and measured, then the parallel one is run and measured.p  pIs the behavior on the chart normalp  pIn mainp  precode     do n measurements     for int n  0 n lt measurements n           display progress         System.out.printlnProgress   float n  measurements  100            single measurement         for int i  0, sizen  size i lt steps i, sizen  increment                allocate memory for matrices source a, source b, result             float[][] srcaseq  new float[sizen][sizen]             float[][] srcbseq  new float[sizen][sizen]             float[][] srcapar  new float[sizen][sizen]             float[][] srcbpar  new float[sizen][sizen]             float[][] resseq  new float[sizen][sizen]             float[][] respar  new float[sizen][sizen]               fill source matrices with random values             miscManager.genRandMatrixsrcaseq, sizen             miscManager.genRandMatrixsrcbseq, sizen             miscManager.genRandMatrixsrcapar, sizen             miscManager.genRandMatrixsrcbpar, sizen               create time variables             long before, after, deltat               time measurement, serial multiplication             before  System.nanoTime             serialMultiplier.mulsrcaseq, srcbseq, resseq, sizen             after  System.nanoTime             deltat  after  before              add measurement to data             data[i][0]  deltat               time measurement, parallel multiplication             before  System.nanoTime             parallelMultiplier.mulsrcapar, srcbpar, respar, sizen             after  System.nanoTime             deltat  after  before              add measurement to data             data[i][1]  deltat                   System.out.printlnProgress 100.0 codepre  pserial multiplicationp  precodepublic void mulfloat[][] srca, float[][] srcb, float[][] res, int size      for int i  0 i lt size i          for int j  0 j lt size j              res[i][j]  0             for int k  0 k lt size k                  res[i][j]  srca[i][k]  srcb[k][j]                             codepre  pparallel multiplicationp  precodepublic void mulfloat[][] srca, float[][] srcb, float[][] res, int size        calculate data required for labor division     int n  size  size     int load  n  cpuCoreCount  1     int remainder  n  cpuCoreCount       create thread pool     ExecutorService taskExecutor  Executors.newFixedThreadPoolcpuCoreCount       assign tasks     int m  0     int i  0     while i lt remainder          taskExecutor.executenew MultiplierUnitsrca, srcb, res, size, m, m  load         m  load         i          load     while i lt cpuCoreCount          taskExecutor.executenew MultiplierUnitsrca, srcb, res, size, m, m  load         m  load         i            wait for tasks to finish     taskExecutor.shutdown     try        taskExecutor.awaitTerminationLong.MAXVALUE, TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS      catch InterruptedException e          System.out.printlnerror thread pool interrupted exception         System.exit1       codepre  pThe values in the data array are later divided by measurements to get the average.p  pMultiplierUnitp  precodepublic class MultiplierUnit implements Runnable        source a, source b, result     private final float[][] srca, srcb, res      matrix dimensions, first entry to execute, last entry to execute     private final int size, first, last      public MultiplierUnitfloat[][] srca, float[][] srcb, float[][] res,             int size, int first, int last          this.srca  srca         this.srcb  srcb         this.res  res         this.size  size         this.first  first         this.last  last            parallel multiplication     Override     public void run           index setup         int i  first  size         int j  first  size         int n  first           computation         while n lt last              while j lt size ampamp n lt last                  res[i][j]  0                 for int k  0 k lt size k                      res[i][j]  srca[i][k]  srcb[k][j]                                  n                 j                          j  0             i                codepre

So I have a view which allows the User to Create an entity A. Entity A has a reference to entity B, its address, which in turn has a reference to entity C, the address region.p  pSo Ive figured out that I can create an Editor Template which can be injected into the Create view for entity A, and returns the A model with its entity B reference populated. I can do the same thing on the entity B template, injecting an editor template for entity C and getting back the correct entity in Bs reference property. p  pMy problem is that entity C is a rarely created entity. The User needs the ability to create one, and its a very trivial entity has name and countryenum, so I dont want the user to have to visit a special page just to create this entity after theyve figured out that the correct C entity isnt yet in the list, then come back to the page and reenter all the other fields they might have already filled. p  pHow can I create a conditional view or set of views, which will allow the user to either select an existing entity C, or create a new entity C if they need to, without leaving the Create  Entity A pagep  pFor clarity this is my current setupp  pEntityACreate.cshtmlp  precodeusing Html.BeginForm    Html.AntiForgeryToken   Html.HiddenForA gt A.ParentID   ltfieldsetgt     Entity A editors etc...

Negative 2884 pIm very new to this. Trying to create an HTML page with a simple 2 column layout. Both columns are divs inside a container div. One column is floated left, and the other is floated right. Since one column has a background color, it is important that the two divs are the same height. Ive accomplished this by setting the html, body, container div, and each floated divs height to 100. Works fine. But the one paragraph in the content floated right div is pretty big, and it overflows out of the div. This leads to this section at the bottom of the page where the div with the background color has no background color. Im aware of the css overflow property, but I dont want it to overflow, Id like the div to just be as big as the content within it. Better way to do this Any other tips not related to teh question are also welcome. When I see all these unexpected bugs pop up, I still feel very much the beginner.

Hailed as a breakthrough upon its release, its critical standing has diminished somewhat in the ensuing decades because of the occasional pretensions of the concept and because of the insubstantial nature of some of the songs that functioned as little more than devices to advance the rather sketchy plot. Nonetheless, the double album has many excellent songs, including Im Free, Pinball Wizard, Sensation, Christmas, Were Not Gonna Take It, and the dramatic tenminute instrumental Underture. Though the album was slightly flawed, Townshends ability to construct a lengthy conceptual narrative brought new possibilities to rock music. Despite the complexity of the project, he and the Who never lost sight of solid pop melodies, harmonies, and forceful instrumentation, imbuing the material with a suitably powerful grace.ltpgt             ltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltbodygt lthtmlgtcodepre div div p

Negative 2884 pUsing Springs caching abstraction, how can I have a cache refresh an entry asynchronously while still returning the old entryp  pI am trying to use Springs caching abstraction to create a caching system where after a relatively short soft timeout, cache entries are made eligible for refresh. Then, when they are queried, the cached value is returned, and an asynchronous update operation is started to refresh the entry. I would also p  pGuavas cache builder allows me to specify that entries in the cache should be refreshed after a certain amount of time. The reload method of the cache loader can then be overridden with an asynchronous implementation, allowing the stale cached value to be returned until the new one is retrieved.

What I am ultimately trying to do is figure out a way to not only use SSH to access a server and execute commands using a python script and finish there, but also have it open an instance of the terminal after executing all the commands for continued use. p  pCurrently the server has modules that clients have to manually activate using commands after they have established an SSH connection. p  pFor examplep  pmodule python p  pThis command would give the user access to python. p  pFollowing this the user would then be able to use python and all its commands through the ssh connection in the terminal. p  pThe issue I have with the methods listed earlier for executing these commands is that it does not display an instance of the terminal. It successfully executes the commands but since these commands have to be executed every time a new SSH connection is established its worthless unless I can get essentially a copy of the terminal that the Python script executed and loaded up all the modules with.p  pDoes any one have a solution to this Ive scoured the web for hours to no success. p  pThis is a very difficult issue to explain so if anything is unclear please ask me and I will try my best to rephrase things.

Negative 2884 pIm running Spring Data Neo4j on two strongplayframework 2.3.8strong servers, after migrating to the new spring data neo4j 3.3.0 have been getting different results from queries from each of the servers. This didnt happen before when i was using version 3.2.1. I am using neo4j as a server and not embedded.p  pMy site shows a status NORMAL or ERROR which is changed by users. The status is updated every 2 seconds by polling one of the two servers. The problem is I have times that each server returns different results. So although the status is stable in the DB confirmed by the neo4j console it changes rapidly for the users every time they poll a different server.p  pI thought that perhaps i am getting a cached result from the server but couldnt find anything about caching in the new spring data that would explain this.p  pIve noticed that this problem happens when I use the repository findOne function and when i switched to using a new function with a query codequerymatch n where idn  0 return ncode it stopped happening.

This index structure is then sorted, allowing Binary Searches to be   performed on it.p blockquote  pThe way I understood ORC indexing is, that ORC keeps statistics min, max, sum about the rows every 10000 rows by default and if I query the data it looks at the statistics to figure out if it needs to read the row chunk or not.p  pSo is it correct that ORC indexing does not sort the datap  pI have a 69 column large table with very unstructured data and I would like to be able to perform adhoc querys on every column. To do so, I would like to be able to sort every column through an index or at least most of them.

Negative 2884 pIm pretty new to Keystone as I recently inherited a codebase on a project that used it. We were locked into version 0.2.42 so I just updated to the latest, version 0.3.12 and now Im having a strange issue. All our models with images use S3 for upload Types.S3File and it used to just place the image with the original file name at the root of the specified S3 bucket. Now, however, the files are being renamed with what Im guessing is a temporary string name. For example if I upload a file called MyImage.jpg, it will upload as something like 7830c3a6bc7b6790e63de9a3c3716b06.jpg. Is there a new configuration I need to edit to retain the original file name as used to be the case Thank you for your help.p  pSethp

Negative 2884 pIm working on a project and I have two databases a production database and a test database. I want to be able to switch between the two on the fly, each time the program launches. Problem is, I use a lot of preconfigured Ado.Net objects bindingsources, datasets, etc. in my program. By preconfigured, I mean selecting them from the toolbox, dropping them on a form, and setting them up without any codebehind. As a result, everything is going to be tied to a connection strings found in Properties  Settings.p  pMy question is, is there a way to dynamically change the details of that connection string at runtime Or, is there a way I can have two connection strings in Properties  Settings and flip a switch and change the connection strings in every single objectp  pI know I can hard code the sources in each form, but thats a little inconvenient Im quite the novice. More importantly I use DevExpress Reports, which I believe is considerably less straight forward to hard code a connection for I would assume its possible, but I wouldnt know where to begin.p  pSo Im hoping for a simple solution.

For example when I wrote the following to remove a dept and its emp childp  precodepublic ActionResult Index2              var dept  t.Depts.Includewgtw.Emps.SingleOrDefaulta gt a.DeptID  1          t.Depts.Removedept         t.SaveChanges         return Contentsucces      codepre  pThen EF will NOT try to remove the related Emps, instead it will only try to set the Emp.DeptID FK as null, and since the FK is required I get the following exceptionp  precodeThe operation failed The relationship could not be changed because one or more of the foreignkey properties is nonnullable. When a change is made to a relationship, the related foreignkey property is set to a null value. If the foreignkey does not support null values, a new relationship must be defined, the foreignkey property must be assigned another nonnull value, or the unrelated object must be deleted. codepre  pBy default EF will do Cascade on delete when trying to delete a parent object that has children in a manytomany relation and i am retrieving the child records using .Include. When I wrote the followingp  precodepublic ActionResult Index4              Account acc  t.Accounts             .Includeagta.Emps             .FirstOrDefault         t.Accounts.Removeacc         t.SaveChanges         return Contentsucces      codepre  pThen EF removes the Account and the related AccountEmp rows but did not remove the Emp objects themselves.p  pSo I have the following 4 questionsp  p1.Can I conclude that EF will implement Set Null as the Delete rule for a onetomany relation, when i try to remove a parent object and i am retrieving the child records using code.Includecode 2.And will it implement Cascade as the delete rule for a manytomany,when i try to remove a parent object and i am retrieving the child records using code.Includecode, but without removing the Emps in my casep  p3.If I write the followingp  precode  public ActionResult Index2                      var emp  t.Emps.Includewgtw.Dept.SingleOrDefaulta gt a.EmpID  1              t.EMPs.Removeemp             t.SaveChanges             return Contentsucces          codepre  pthis will never affect the Dept. So when I try to remove a child, then EF will never try to remove its parentp  p4.If I want to remove the related Emps when I remove an Account, how can I do so using EF Currently if I remove an Account, and I load the EMPs navigation property using .Include this will result in removing the Account amp the AccountEMP rows but will never affect the related EMP. Unlike setting the FK Delete rule as Cascade on the database schema, where setting this at the DB level will result in removing the AccountEMP amp the EMP rows when removing the Account, so can I get this inside EFp  pbaring in mind that for all the above scenario i am using the default End1 delete amp End2 delete to be none inside the Model Browser. and also i did not specify any Delete constraints on the DB..  strongMy question is how EF works when i am specifying what to delete by loading the related child objects using code.Includecode on class basisstrongp

Negative 2884 pstrongBackgroundstrong I often ask myself the following question and I never found an answer without flaws and I think this is a common problem in modularized software development. So I am not quite sure if programmers.stackexchange.com is more suitable  but this question is totally focused on Java and I want a Java solutionp  pstrongExamplestrong There is a text editor that loads several plugins who are responsible for their file type interaction in the text editor Java plugin handles Java codefiles, CC plugin handles CC codefiles etc.  each plugin needs a configuration and access to the file manager. These plugins have to access an application API to do some useful stuff without reinventing the wheel. Keep in mind, that for example the file manager of the application also needs dataobjects itself For example a configuration with line separator type, type of read mode etc..p  pstrongQuestionstrong How can I pass the configurationfile manager to an pugin Based on an interface or abstract class in a modularized application when the file manager also need a configuration itselfp  pstrongProblemsThings to keep in mindstrongp  ul liWe need to pass data to the file manager Configuration etc.li liJava doesnt support custom constructors in interfaces and abstract classesli liAnnotationed objects are hard to test and often the root of all evilli liTry to create a properclear API and make it hard as possible to abuseuse the API in a wring wayli ul  pstrongSolution 1strong Use dependency injection via annotation in the plugins, so we can get the configuration and file manager and use them in our plugins. This is the smoothest solution but not that easy to test.p  precodepublic class JavaPlugin implements Plugin      Autowired     Configuration configuration      Autowired     FileManager filemanager      public String processTextString rawtext               Do stuff and access the configurationfile manager       codepre  pstrongSolution 2strong Make the file manager a singleton ... but wait, how do we pass the configuration to the singleton Make another static method that takes these parameters Thats not really a singleton anymore and the hell of a proper API.p  precodepublic class JavaPlugin implements Plugin      public String processTextString rawtext              FileManager filemanager  FileManager.getInstance         Configuration configuiration  filemanager.getConfiguration          Do stuff and use the configurationfile manager        public class FileManager      private static FileManager filemanager      private Configuration configuration      private FileManagerConfiguration configuration              this.configuration  configuration           public static FileManager getIntialInstanceConfiguration configuration              iffilemanager  null                      filemanager  new FileManagerconfiguration                  return filemanager           public static FileManager getInstance              return filemanager           public Configuration getConfiguration              return configuration       codepre  pstrongSolution 3strong Just tell all plugin developers to implement a constructor that takes a configuration and a file manager as parameters Because Java doesnt support custom constructors in an interfaceabstract class. We create the plugin objects with reflection and pass the configuration and file manager to the constructor. But what happens if we need a third object p  precodepublic class JavaPlugin implements Plugin      publicConfiguration configuration, FileManager filemanager               Save them           public String processTextString rawtext              FileManager filemanager  FileManager.getInstance         Configuration configuiration  filemanager.getConfiguration          Do stuff and use the configurationfile manager        public class PhpPlugin implements Plugin      public PhpPlugin               Oh dear you just broke your plugin....           public String processTextString rawtext               Do stuff and use the configurationfile manager       codepre  pstrongFinal thoughtsstrong I am not 100 satisfied with one of these 3 solutions  everyone has flaws. I prefer a puristic that forces a developer to follow the API For example he should not be able to use a singleton anywhere  he should get the data and if he needs them he has to store them  otherwise he has to deal with it.p  pstrongStackOverflow questionstrong Are there other ways to solve this problem Maybe thoughts I missedp

Negative 2884 pIve been banging my head on this for a few days now, and seem to be no closer than before. Roughly it seems like the clientContext.executeQueryAsync is not working properly for creating multiple items in sharepoint. Here is the basic design.  I created a web part in my share point site that connects to an html page. The page is on the home.aspx of the site, that has the following content added to it via a content pagep  precodeltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 StrictEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1strict.dtdgt lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtmlgt ltheadgt ltmeta httpequivContentType contenttexthtml charsetutf8 xundefined gt ltscript typetextjavascript srcappsdreSiteAssetsJavascriptjquery1.11.0.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcappsdreSiteAssetsJavascriptBatchControl.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcappsdreSiteAssetsJavascriptjquery.SPServices2014.01.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcappsdreSiteAssetsJavascriptPageLoader.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascript srcappsdreSiteAssetsJavascriptBatchExecution.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript typetextjavascriptgtExecuteOrDelayUntilScriptLoadedfunctionloadmasterpage, sp.jsltscriptgt lttitlegtHome Pagelttitlegt ltheadgt ltbodygt ltdiv idbatch stylevisibilityhiddengt ltbutton idbatchcontrol onclickExecuteBatchControlgtCreate DRE Recordsltbuttongt ltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pSo its a very simple piece of HTML. The PageLoader library loads the button after SP.js is loaded. p  precodefunction loadmasterpage  document.readyfunction      alertHere      batch.cssvisibility,visible   codepre  pThats all the web content does in the Home.aspx page.  It shows a simple HTML button. Now comes the baffling mystery.  So if I click the button the BatchControl library executes the following codep  precodefunction ExecuteBatchControl  createListItem   function createListItem       var clientContext  new SP.ClientContext.getcurrent     var oList  clientContext.getweb.getlists.getByTitleDiscrepancy Report      forx0xlt4x     var itemCreateInfo  new SP.ListItemCreationInformation     this.oListItem  oList.addItemitemCreateInfo      oListItem.setitemTitle, B2Batch         oListItem.update      clientContext.loadoListItem           clientContext.executeQueryAsync         Function.createDelegatethis, this.onQuerySucceeded,          Function.createDelegatethis, this.onQueryFailed        function onQuerySucceeded      alertItem created   oListItem.getid     alertSuccess     input[TitleCaller ID].val   function onQueryFailedsender, args      alertRequest failed.   args.getmessage           n  args.getstackTrace     codepre  pIt creates the records, but the onQuerySucceeded function never executes.  If you remove the for...loop, it will execute, and it works fine.  Why doesnt the batch coding work.  Its almost like there is a stability issue with it, but I cant say.  No one seems to know the answer here. Is it because I hooked up my html page to a web content web part  I am completely lost and baffled.  PLEASE I NEED HELP p

Negative 2884 pI have a file with addresses and their latitude and longitude values. I am trying to put them in a database.

I cant delete the objects and recreate them because of some bad design decision. p  pOne approach was to use the google maps api, passing the place address and taking the  lat and long from the result and then check if a place with the created point exists, but is not accurate and i am relying on request quotas.p  pI decided to check if a Place object exists in a square or area given a lat and long from current row in the file. p  pWhat I would like to as is p  pwhich is the radio or values to add and subtract from the coordinates to create an accurate area to search this place.p
Negative 2884 pI want to create a script that checks a siteautomates an action every 10 minutes in the browser on a mac. This action is not available through the sites API.

Negative 2884 pis there any way to check if the orion subscription attribute subscription, not context availability subscription is currently active or expired Something similar to codediscoverContextAvailabilitycode for context information.p  pExample use casep  ul liI add a sensor device inside my applicationli liRegister a context and a subscription for that device on Orionli liFrom that point subscription is running and returning sensor data to my application periodicallyli liNow, when the subscription expires the data simply stops comingli ul  pWhat is the recommended way to extend this subscription How can you know that it has expired in the first placep  pThe only way I see it is to store the expiration date in my app after creating the subscription, and run a scheduled task to extend it on that date.p  pAnother way is to extend all subscriptions in fixed intervals for example make all subscriptions run for 2 months, and every month run the extension task.p  pThe best and easiest way would be to register subscriptions without duration unlimited duration but I dont see that option anywhere in the documentation.p  pA similar problem exists with context registrations too, but I resolved it using the codediscoverContextAvailabilitycode method. Before each codequeryContextcode or codeupdateContextcode I check if the context is expired with codediscoverContextAvailabilitycode. If it is I register it again and continue with query or update requests.p  pI know there is codesubscribeContextAvailabilitycodebut it has the same problem like attribute subscriptions. Once it expires how do you know it has expired and how do you extend itp
Negative 2884 pSo I built this plugin, and while testing it out everything worked well until I finally reached the codeonSubmitcode part of the plugin. What is happening is that the form will submit once successfully but then afterwards it seems to be doubling the amount of times it submits. I dont exactly know how this is happening hence why I am turning to you guys for assistance.p  pI have provided a demo form, the way the plugin operates with the form and the plugin itself.
