Positive 63161 pIts possible extend underscorelodash by creating mixins, but what if I would like to have a function that does something similar to existing lodash function. For example lets say I would like to add a function that compares two objects by looking into a certain property key. Function would take two objects and a property key name. Sounds easy, right Now imagine I would like to overload existing code.isEqualcode instead of creating brand new mixin with a different name. And in that function it would first check if first two arguments are objects and third argument is a string, and if not, then it would call original code.isEqualcode function.p  pI know this is not really a good idea, but I was wondering if its doable. I tried creating a mixin with a name code.isEqualcode that looks like thisp  precodefunction isEqualvalue, other, customizer, thisArg      console.logmy own isEqual      return .isEqual.applythisArg  this, arguments  codepre  pApparently this didnt work, because it recursively keeps calling itself.

Negative 63161 pI was under the impression that FastCGI allowed you to kinda load in your web app once, and then you just provide FastCGI with some function, like codemyHandleHTTPRequesturlcode, that would then be called whenever a request came. This way youd get much better performance as your app is ready in memory all the time, rightp  pBut Im starting to understand, that this is not the case. Or am I mistakenp  pIt seems to me, that PHP is being loaded by FastCGI, ok, and this gives some improvement, but then emmyem app is still being reloaded on every request.p  pId like to load my app or read framework once and then reload say every 500 requests or so. Can I do thatp  pemEditem This question has been rephrased into this one a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions935202customphpfastcgiinterfaceCustom PHP FastCGI interfacea p

Negative 63161 pI am refactoring some code in an existing system.  The goal is to remove all instances of the XmlDocument to reduce the memory footprint.

Negative 63161 pI am currently building a rails application based around insurance. There is an admin section where the staff can control the system tables, mostly what appears in drop down lists, although some are more complex with their own associations. The main model in this application is the policy, this needs to holdlink to information in many other tables, e.g. claimants, defendants, the level of cover, the users etc. Each of those may have their own associations such as linking to a person which in turn links to addresses etc.p  pOne of the more complicated tables that the policy links to is the overall level of cover which holds the financial information to determine the premium, payments etc.p  pWhen a policy is created I need to take a snapshot of all that data. If the policy is amended by an admin user later there needs to be version control, even on the associated data.p  pIm wondering if anyone has any general solutions to this problem. Currently Im pondering over orphan records, single table inheritance, leaving the system table links in place but making that data noneditable, coping the data into a fields in the policy table making it a text box on edit, select box on create or creating two tables, one for live, one for the templates.p  pSo far the best I can think of is a collection of the different methods above based on the applications needs. This must be a general problem in applications Do you have any better ideasadvice on how to tackle this type of problemp

Negative 63161 pLets say your app enables users to create their own tables in the database to hold their own, custom data. Each table would have its own schema. What are some good approachesp  pMy first stab involved dynamically creating migration files and model files bu Id like to run this on heroku where you cant write to the filesystem. p  pIm thinking eval may be the way to go to create and run the migration class and the model class. But I want to make sure the model class exists when a new process of the app is spawned. Can probably do this by storing these class definition with each user as they create new tables and then run through them all at startup. But now its convulted enough that I may be missing something obvious.  p

Negative 63161 pI am relatively new to both WPF and NHibernate and attempting to build an application that combines the two, using the MVVM pattern. However, I am struggling to understand when and where my application should open and close NHibernate sessions and transactions.p  pFrom what I have read, it is recommended that sessions should be kept as short as possible. Therefore, aside from the obvious threadsafety considerations, I assume it is not correct to open a session at the application level and share it around On the other hand, I also realize that very short sessions scoped within business methods will result in detached entities and also prevent me from exploiting NHibernates lazy loading. Is this a normal and unavoidable way to design a WPFNH applicationp  pUnfortunately all the good code samples and the only book I can find on this topic  NHibernate in Action are focused towards ASP.NET applications, where the best practice is apparently fairly clear cut  a session and a transaction span exactly one Http request.p  pSo, I would appreciate some guidance from WPF developers, to help me to understand session management in WPF ideally pointing me to some good code samples.p  pMany thanks,p  pTimp

Negative 63161 pI have a process where a user puts in a comma delimited list that is then processed one item at a time. I want to be able to indicate to the user that it is processing and let them know when it is done. So I used the curtain idea from Borgars replay to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions205631javascriptloadingbusyindicatorortransparentdivoverpageoneventclick... Div Over Pagea. This worked but the curtain disappears well before the process is done.

ImageMagick, but hey, Im open for suggestions p  pI believe Facebook is doing thisp  pSay you have a max width x height of 250x200, Facebook is optimizing the use of this. Tries to use as much of the 250x200 as possible. If for instance you scale down an image and get 220x200, then they cut from the top and the bottom of the image until they use as much as possible of the 250x200 frame. Actually I think they take more from the bottom, than the top around 12.5, which I believe is because most pictures have the head at the top and Facebook realizes this.p  pIs there any name for this kind of resizing algorithm And is there any way to have ImageMagick do thisp  pThanks in advancep  pstrongEditstrong It actually appears that Facebook might not be doing this smart resizing technique after all. They just resize where they have a minwidthminheight. Then when they show the image in their album, they cut from the topbottom or leftright to use as much as possible for the frame that is how I perceive it at least.p  pTobiasp

My code tests each of the results elementbyelement, looking for the first and  best good one.  There can be a very very large number to test.p  pLets say Im testing the first result ACE.  Lets say when I test the second element C I find that ACE is a bad result.  There is no need to test ACF or ACG.  I would want to skip from the failed ACE directly to trying ADE.

Negative 63161 pMy iPhone 4.1.2 app has a menu, each of whose entries lead to a different table view populated by codeNSManagedObjectcode subclasses.

Negative 63161 pThis is my first question after having used this place as my go to for a general opinion on what worksdoesntwhy and the such.  So lets try this out...p  pWith my limited experience Ive been trying to get my head round the better ways of creating fixed data fields that I can refer back to throughout my program  things like enduserviewable strings that I show repeatedly and other parameters that Id like to keep constant and safe from change.  Ive kept my reused data in separate static classes and put my strings in codeprivate static readonlycode arrays that I expose through the use of wrapping in private codeIListscode that have public getters that return the single string Im after.  Hopefully Ive not abused terminology so far What Ive done so farp  precodenamespace MyNamespace      public static partial class Tables                private static readonly string[] Messages                                           One,                       Two                               private static readonly IListltstringgt MessagesReadOnly  Array.AsReadOnlyMessages           public static IListltstringgt Messages  get  return MessagesReadOnly         codepre  pThat much I understand but now Ive got a 2 dimensional table of data codeintcode that I need to store in a similarly nonexposed manner that I can access.br This data is going into its own class as now Im dealing with a separate realworld data type. Realworld scenario  Ive got different fuels with their associated combustion constants that Ill need to access to perform combustion analysis using data that I get from a gas analyser.  So I want to keep these arrayslists separate with all their methods but I cant seem to figure out how to do this.p  pIf I do like I did before and go via the route of array but 2D this time then I run into the issue that it seems according to info on MSDN that codeArray.AsReadOnlymyArraycode only works for onedimensional arrays.  Im not savvy enough to know exactly how to write my own to work around this assuming thats a simple enough task.  So then if I go to trying to use strongjaggedstrong arrays, as that seems to be the other viable route Ive found, I get stuck trying to figure out how and where to create the initial jagged array constructor or as class method and then what about where to initialise the array within thatp  pIf I didnt need to protect the array then I can put it all in the constructor and that might be ok as far as I can tell so far but I have to keep it nonexposed.  The first way I understood how that programatically fit within a class but trying to use jagged arrays nonexposed has got me all muddled up.  All the examples I see on the web seem to create them and initialise within codemaincode which is fine although exposed but as Im putting this elsewhere how can I make it available to anything that might need the data whilst not exposing themp  pHopefully you understand why I feel like Im going in circles, maybe the answer is really simple and Im missing the obvious but until I see someone else do similar I cant figure it out, and I havent been able to find anything close enough to give me the clues.  If there already exists a similar post on SO please point me in that direction.  Like Ive said, Ive scoured both MSDN, SO and wandered the web in search of breadcrumbs.p  pLet me know if you need more info about what Ive been trying and thanks for reading.p  pIve just been adding tags to this question and seen that theres an Array tag so Im off to see if I can narrow things down some more there.  Not sure if I should add that tag too, I could add Lists also...p
Negative 63161 pAm I correct in my understanding of how to populate an codeNSOutlineviewcode with an codeNSTreeControllercode who is bound to two seperate entities that have a relationship between themp  pMy codeNSTreeControllercode has a managedObjectContext bound to my codeappDelegatecode. My codeObject Controllercode for this  is an entity named strongclientsstrong. My codeNSOutlineViewscode codetableColumncode is bound to the codeNSTreeControllercode and strongclientsstrong codekey pathcode strongclientCompanystrong and this populates my codeNSOutlineViewcode correctly with a list of company names.p  pMy second entity, strongprojectsstrong, has a relationship property called strongprojectParentstrong inversebound to a property in clients called strongclientChildstrong. Through this relationship, I want the children of my codeNSTreeControllercode to be made up of the relevant strongprojectsstrong entries that have the relevant strongclientCompanystrong as a parent.p  pTo attempt this, I made strongclientChildstrong the codechildrencode codekey pathcode in my codeNSTreeControllercode and then bound my codecontent setcode of the same controller to the strongclientChildstrong codekey pathcode of my strongclientsstrong entity with the codeController Keycode as selected.p  pThis method and various combinations dont seem to work and produce varying errors. Its only if I leave out that last codecontent setcode binding step that the program runs without errors on startup and has openclose icons next to the the outlineview entries, suggesting it populated like I wanted. On trying to open one of the entries, it produces an error suggesting my strongprojectsstrong entity isnt KVC compliant with my strongclientChildstrong property. Ive gone over and over the bindings and cant seem to find the problem.p
Negative 63161 pI have a design question that has been bugging me for a while but I cannot find a good in a OOP sense solution for this. The language is C and I keep coming back to RTTI  which is often referred to as an indicator for bad design.p  pSuppose we have a set of different kinds of modules implemented as different classes. Each kind of module is characterized by a defined interface, however the implementation may vary.  Thus my first idea was to create an interface pure abstract class for each kind of module e.g. IModuleFoo, IModuleBar etc. and the implementations in seperate classes. So far so good.p  precodeclass IModuleFoo    public     virtual void doFoo  0   class IModuleBar    public     virtual void doBar  0  codepre  pOn the other hand we have a set of application classes and each of them uses a couple of those modules but only through the interfaces  even the modules themselves might use other modules. However, all of the application classes will share the same pool of modules. My idea was to create a manager class ModuleManager for all modules which application classes can query for the module types they need. The available modules and the concrete implementation are set up during initialization of the manager and may vary over time but that is not really part of my question.p  pSince the number of different module kinds is most probably 10 and may increase over time it does not appear suitable to me to store references or pointers to them separately. In addition there might be a couple of functions the manager needs to invoke on all managed modules. Thus I created another interface IManagedModule with the benefit that I can now use a container list, set, whatsoever of IManagedModules to store them in the manager.p  precodeclass IManagedModule    public     virtual void connect  0      ...   codepre  pThe consequence is that a module that shall be managed needs to inherit both from the IManagedModule and from the appropriate interface for its type. p  pBut things turn ugly when I think about the ModuleManager. It can be assumed that there is at most one instance of each module type present at each time. Thus if it was possible to do something like this where manager is the instance of the ModuleManager, everything would be finep  precodeIModuleFoo pFoo  manager.getIModuleFoo codepre  pBut Im pretty sure that its not. I also thought about a template based solution likep  precodeIModuleFoo pFoo  manager.getltIModuleFoogt codepre  pThat could work but I have no idea how to find the right module within the manager if all I have is a set of IManagedModules  that is without the use of RTTI, of course. p  pOne approach would be to provide IManagedModule with a virtual emgetIdem method, rely on the implementations to use nonambigous ids for each kind of module and do the pointer casting on your own. But thats just reinventing the wheel namely RTTI and requires a lot of discipline within the implementing classes providing the right ids etc... which is not desirable.p  pLong story short  the question is if there is really no way around some kind of RTTI here and in this case RTTI might even be a valid solution or if there might be a better cleaner, safer, ... design which exhibits the same flexibility e.g. loose coupling between application classes and module classes... Did I miss anything      p

Negative 63161 pI would like to create a Sass mixin for the boxshadow property but am running into some trouble. Some of the existing code looks like this.p  precodesomeDiv    mozboxshadow0 0 5px rgba0,0,0,.25   someOtherDiv    mozboxshadow0 0 5px rgba0,0,0,.25 inset   theLastDiv    mozboxshadow 0 0 5px rgba0,0,0,.25, 0 1px 0 rgba255,255,255,.2 inset  codepre  pTrying to roll all of this into 1 mixin is becoming problematic. The documentation for using logic within mixins is pretty sparse.p  pI would like to create some mixin along the lines ofp  precodemixin boxShadowxOffSet, yOffSet, blur, red, green, blue, opacity, inset  false    if inset  true      mozboxshadow xOffSetpx yOffSetpx blurpx rgbared,green,blue inset    else      mozboxshadow xOffSetpx yOffSetpx blurpx rgbared,green,blue     codepre  pThis is throwing errors because I guess Sass cant evaluate the inset variable.p  pThe previous example only demonstrates the problem I am having when it comes to to boxshadow being inset or not. The other problem I am having is when there are multiple boxshadows being declared on a single element. Refer to theLastDiv described above if for reference.p  precodemixin boxShadowdeclarations  2, xOffSet1, yOffSet1, blur1, red1, green1, blue1, opacity1 xOffSet2, yOffSet2, blur2, red2, green2, blue2, opacity2    if declarations  1      mozboxshadow xOffSetpx yOffSetpx blurpx rgbared,green,blue    else if declarations  2      mozboxshadow xOffSet1px yOffSet1px blur1px rgbared1,green1,blue1, xOffSet2px yOffSet2px blur2px rgbared2,green2,blue2    codepre  pSometimes an element has one boxshadow and other times it has to separate boxshadows. Am I mistaken that Sass lacks the ability to decipher this logic and that to accomplish this would require separate Mixins one for elements with one box shadow, another for mixins with two box shadows.p  pAnd to complicate the matter, how does the opacity problem described above factor into this Would love to get some feedback on this. Let me know if Im mistaken or the way Im thinking about the problem is flawed in general. Thanksp

Negative 63161 pi have the following scenario For better illustration, the example is very simplified a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comdkYNV.png relnofollowDatabase Modela BASCOSTCODE refers to BASCONTEXT. The key for this table is a composite with COSTCODEID and the CONTEXTFK. CONTEXTFK refers to BASCONTEXT. To build up a hierarchical tree, a CostCode can have a parent. For this reason there is a reference to the table itselfe.p  pThe schema file for Context is like thatp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8 gt lthibernatemapping xmlnsurnnhibernatemapping2.2 schemadbo assemblyApp.NHibernate.DataObjects namespaceApp.NHibernate.DataObjectsgt       ltclass nameApp.NHibernate.DataObjects.Context tableBASCONTEXT lazyfalse mutabletrue gt         ltid nameId typeInt16 columnCONTEXTID gt           ltgenerator classassignedgt         ltidgt         ltproperty nameName columnNAME typeString notnulltruegt        ltclassgt     lthibernatemappinggt codepre  pAnd the schema for CostCode is like thatp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8 gt lthibernatemapping xmlnsurnnhibernatemapping2.2 schemadbo assemblyApp.NHibernate.DataObjects namespaceApp.NHibernate.DataObjectsgt   ltclass nameApp.NHibernate.DataObjects.CostCode tableCONCOSTCODE mutabletrue gt      ltcompositeid nameCompositeId classCostCodeId unsavedvalueanygt       ltkeyproperty nameId columnCOSTCODEID typeString gt       ltkeymanytoone nameContext columnCONTEXTFK classContext lazyproxygt     ltcompositeidgt      ltmanytoone nameParentCostCode classCostCode lazyproxy inserttrue updatetrue gt       ltcolumn namePARENTCOSTCODEFKgt       ltcolumn nameCONTEXTFKgt     ltmanytoonegt      ltproperty nameName columnNAME typeStringgt   ltclassgt lthibernatemappinggt codepre  pIf i create a new CostCode entity and run Commit i get the following exception strongSystem.IndexOutOfRangeException Invalid index 13 for this SqlParameterCollection with Count13.strongp  pI think NHibernate has a problem with the reference ParentCostCode, which refers to a parent CostCode object. NHIbernate assumes to write a value to column PARENTCOSTCODEFK and to CONTEXTFK. In the mapping the compositeid points to CONTEXTFK and the ParentCostCode points to CONTEXTFK. So they are sharing the same column and NHibernate should only write a value to the column PARENTCOSTCODEFK.p  pOne solution is to add an additional column maybe PARENTCONTEXTFK to table BASCOSTCODE to represent the Context for the parent object. But i dont want to have an additional column, because the values of CONTEXTFK and PARENTCONTEXTFK must have the same value, if there exist a referenceto a parent object. And that would be redundant.p  pAre there better solutions for that kind of problem Or i cant prevent a additional column in BASCOSTCODEp  pMany thanks in advance for your answersp
Negative 63161 pIm wondering what the best way is to implement a series of different animations.

Negative 63161 pI need a view controlleron ipad to share two modes, one in portrait and one in landscape. Actually, I pretty much want to mimic the functionality of UISplitViewController, but I want to be able to use not as the top level view controller. HIG guidelines aside, I have a general problem that I think anyone who is switching views between orientations will run into.p  p1 To provide for smooth transitions between views, I would like to call my view changes and animations inside willRotateToInterfaceOrientationduration instead of didRotateToInterfaceOrientation method. The problem is, at this stage, the view frame and bounds have not yet changed to their new ones, so you end up having to set the frame manually, likep  precodesubview.frame  CGRectMake0,0,320,768 codepre  pinstead of something nicer, maybep  precodesubview.frame  CGRectMake0,0,320, self.view.frame.height codepre  p2 Furthermore, even if you try such shenanigans, if the view autoresizes its subviews, you still get nowhere with it. If you disable the autoresizing of subviews, then stuff like this does not even work anymorep  precodesubview.frame  self.view.frame because then youd have to always specify the exact rect. codepre  pDoes anyone have any insight to offer on thisp  pThanksp

Negative 63161 pSimple problem, actually. I am trying to evaluate the possibilities of Google Apps, using Python as development language. It seems practical to create a web application or web site with it, but how about creating web servicesbr I am not too interested in solutions to create a SOAP or REST service in Python for Google Apps, since a simple Google search should provide plenty of solutions. I am more interested in experiences and ease of use.  p  pBut the real question is When comparing a web service in Google Apps with web services in the Microsoft Azure environment, which would provide the better performance The best user experience I dont care for the actual development languages but need a good comparison of pros and cons of web services in both the Google App Engine and Microsoft Azure.  p  pSomehow, Azure seems better suited for services while Google seems better for sites. A tough choice...br Would be very interesting to see if both could be combined into a single solution. br Btw, choosing which engine to use also means choosing the proper development environment and programming language. While Im proficient in .NET and Python and many other languages, the choice for the service engine determines my focus for future projects.p

Negative 63161 pBarring a custom browserplugin, is there a way to read the Windows registry from a webpage It sounds like a big security issue but the situation is we have very nonsavvy users and we want to have them get some info about their machines for us. Even downloading and running a little app might confuse them, but a webpage that magically gets the info would be fine as they just click a link we send.p  pAny thoughts on how to do this, or if its simply impossible, are welcome. Note it is corporate therefore Windowsonly and can even be IEonly if needed.p

Negative 63161 pI have very simple page at the moment. The only thing that I using PHP for is a switch menu system. So in the switch system i check the variable menu to see what its set to.p  pSo for example if i load the contact info it would be p  blockquote   pwww.mydomain.commenucontactp blockquote  pin the php switch code under menu there is only one thing.p  blockquote   pincludecontact.phpp blockquote  pOk, I know this is very simple, but the problem that I am having is when i change the contact.php the changes wont be noticeable in the browser, not until i actually go directly to that file. So I would have to browse to www.mydomain.comcontact.php and then i see the difference. After doing that I can go back to www.mydomain.commenucontact and see the difference. p  pI have tried to reload, refresh and reload cache command in Firefox, Safari and Chrome. They all work the same way. How can I fix this, its rather time consuming to refresh two pages each time I need to see the changes.p

Negative 63161 pCurrently I have 3 or 4 galleries loaded on one page. Its a photographers site, so each gallery has about 40 images. I originally preloaded the images, where I would just load the first two images so the page loads quickly, then use JS in the background to cycle through a loop and load the rest. It worked well, except that it didnt honor the order, and the order is important. I have seen some examples where you hide the images until they load, but since there are about 120 large images being loaded in the page it causes the page to load slowly.

Negative 63161 pIve run into a maddeningly inconsistent issue with Express in a Node application where I am not able to correctly navigate through the builtin directory rendering due to a URL rewrite. Its easier to explain with codep  precodevar express  requireexpress var app  express.createServer  app.usepublic, express.staticwebcontent app.usepublic, express.directorywebcontent  app.listen8888 codepre  pUsing the ubersimple express server above the contents of codewebcontentcode are displayed as a list of links when you navigate to codelocalhost8888publiccode.

Upon further inpection its revealed that the request is sent out for the right path codepublicjscode, but the server returns a code301  Moved Permanentlycode response that then redirects the browser to codejscode, which proceeds to display an error page because the content cannot be found. No, really p  pAttempts to request a specific file beneath these folders ie codelocalhost8888publicjsmain.jscode works fine and does not have the same issue.p  pThe maddening part is that it was doing this on my dev box for a while and then simply... stopped. Not sure why. When attempting to deploy, however, the production server started having the same issue even though I can no longer reproduce it in my dev environment. Does anyone know why Express seems so intent on rewriting my URLs to the wrong thing p

It downloads the audio file via streaming and creates a temporary .dat file. Each time another increment of the file is downloaded, the MediaPlayer must be stopped so to set the fetched new data to the MediaPlayer. The process plays the audio, but it goes through some little pauses in the way. Its ok to have these pauses because not enough data is downloaded yet, but its not good to have the player paused each time new data is fetched.p  pSo my question is is there another way to play a remote audio file Why does this prepare failed error occur I noticed it happens with some mp3s files, but not with others.

Negative 63161 pI have a GUI application.  In it I allow a user to select from a containerprovided list of algorithms.  Each algorithm will be kicked off as a background task in another view.  I need to support multiple instances of this view, and support multiple instances of the same algorithm.  That view will also be provided by the container.  The algorithm is also stateful.p  pSo I have a case where I need to create instances of my view and algorithm and bind them together at runtime.  I dont have static binding points for these instances, so I cant use the normal injection facilities constructor or property injection.  I dont want to call codenewcode, and I dont want to use the container like a a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryff648968.aspx relnofollowService Locatora.p  pI solved this in Castle.Windsor with the a hrefhttpdocs.castleproject.orgDefault.aspxPageTypedFactoryFacilityampNSWindsorampAspxAutoDetectCookieSupport1 relnofollowTyped Factory Facilitya, but I had to deal with factories all over my app.  The factory design was also a little strange because I had to return my instances to the factory when I was done with them.p  pI am now looking into using NInject because so far the learning curve and intro docs were much better, and Id like to propose a container for my team to use.  But for a scenario like this I think Id have to write my own factories and call the kernel directly to resolve new instances Service Locator embedded in a factory, as well as adding factory methods in my registration code.p  pIs there a generic way to solve this, or is this simply a problem that Dependency Injection wasnt designed to solve on its ownp  hr  pstrongClarificationstrongp  pI said in the comments that Id like a specific answer for Ninject, and Ive gotten that.  And thanks very much   In real life here Ill probably just use the pragmatic solutions that have been proposed.p  pBut I botched my question by providing my basis as a concrete problem.  I was hoping for a more purely fundamental answer to the question in my title.p  pIs there a pureDI technique that allows the user to trigger new instances of components at runtime  Or would all such implementations use the container as a Service Locator, or require a specific quirk to the container e.g. builtin factory support, ala Castle.Windsor or the soontoberelease Ninject factory feature, rather than utilize only aspects of pure DIp  pIve only heard this word from the Java world, and I dont have much idea of what it means  so forgive me   Is what I am looking for some kind of outjectionp

I have my default resource file in English EmailTemplates.resx and then several localized resource files EmailTemplates.ruRU.resx, EmailTemplates.zhCN.resx, EmailTemplates.itIT.resx, EmailTemplates.idID.resx, etc.p  pAmong the resource files, I have two arabic ones EmailTemplates.arAE.resx which is actually in English and EmailTemplates.arSA.resx which is in Arabic. p  pAll the emails for non Arabic locales work perfectly. The app picks up the required locale and uses the corresponding resource files. But when I try to request the Arabic ones, it always fall back to the default resource file.p  pThe way Im setting up the culture is based on the data requested, and not the browser settingsp  precodeThread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture  new CultureInfoculture Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture  CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCultureculture codepre  pWhile debugging I can see that the CultureInfo is properly set to arSA or arAE but when the app retrieves the corresponding resource value, it always picks up the default one.p  pI have entered Arabic data in the default resource file for testing purposes, and the Arabic text displays just fine, so Im sure that it is not a font or HTML layout issue. p  pI have searched all around the Internet, proved different approaches, and no luck. The arSA and arAE are valid CultureInfo values and the app compiles without issues, but it seems that whenever I request the Arabic emails, the app cant find the Arabic resource files.p  pAny ideas Id really appreciate any hits and help p  pCheersp

Negative 63161 pLets say my web app is acting on behalf of users who give their credentials to my app so the app can make API calls to a third party service. Incidentally, this is for posting product offers to this third party site bit like eBay, but on a smaller scale.p  pNow one super convenient way to make this posting easy would be to reuse the sophisticated web form that third party service has to accept product offers for authenticated users. The idea is to populate their web form and redirect the client browser to it so the user can edit things there using the sophisticated and familiar web form. This would be the best user experience and the least implementation work.p  pHowever, it is not a documented way to do it. Whats more, it doesnt work in the simple way, like populating the form fields from request parameters GET or POST. The web form just doesnt work that way.p  pThere might be an alternative. My app could open a session with the third party app on the users behalf, submit all data so it is stored in their database, and then send the users browser all the data it needs to take over the session that my server app opened on his behalf. Note that I havent tried this yet and I reckon it might fail if the third party app ties a session to an IP number which, whether sound or not, an app might do.p  pBut wouldnt it be possible to have the server program opening the HTTP session write all the information needed to take over that session to an HTMLJavascript document and send that document to the users browser, where the Javascript executes and assembles a request such as composed when using a browser on the thirdparty form directly, which Ive been observing using HttpFoxp  pAll the information, that is everything HTTP its obviously not possible to pass the servers IP number to the client ... But all cookies and parameters. The Javascript executing in the browser would then have to use the information Id be somehow passing in the document probably in the script part to compose a request to the third party web site that goes right into the session the server app has opened. This would mean that a document originating from my domain would set cookies add request headers to then have the users browser execute that request.p  pSo in other words, is it technically possible to pass a session from the server to the clientp  pHow would you do it in Javascriptp  h2Updateh2  pAccording to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma6761443269126answers to another question emYou cannot set cookies for another domain.

Networkx pagerank algorithm implementation allows me to easely integrate weighted edges and is said to convert directed graphs to undirected see a hrefhttpnetworkx.lanl.govreferencegeneratednetworkx.algorithms.linkanalysis.pagerankalg.pagerank.htmlnetworkx.algorithms.linkanalysis.pagerankalg.pagerankherea. However, when I tested it still seems to use directed graph.

Negative 63161 pOk, so maybe my search syntax is wrong here, this could have very well been covered in stackoverflow but ive been unable to find anything after hours of searching.  Be warned, I am a novice developer when it comes to this type of stuff and would appreciate any guidance, help or pointers to accomplish the goal.  Im open to suggestions of any type p  pSo, I have a site a hrefhttpwww.animetip.com relnofollowhttpwww.animetip.comap  pOn this site we have a popular feature called a jump menu which allows a user to quickly navigate directly to the page which contains the anime series they would like to see an episode in.  Essentially we have every series on the site over 1000 broken down in an az list.  When a user hovers over a letter, the menu will drop down and display all series that begin with that letter.  A user can then go to the series theyd like to view and click on it to go directly to the page. p  pThe issue with this is SEO.  We are being penalized due to the number of links on the page.  What we need to accomplish is the same or better functionality while reducing the links loaded in the page.  If we could come up with a way to create the menu and have the link itself not be served until its clicked on I believe that would resolve the issue.p  pWhat is the best strategy for doing this  I am no expert by any means, but I was thinking that putting all the links in mySQL and then calling the link as its clicked would be ok, but a friend cautioned me that it would cause a performance hit. I have also reviewed material which indicates you can do the same thing using an array to store the links and then call them as they are needed using PHP.  I grasp the concept of doing that but could use a stub type example to get me started.p  pThe site is built on Wordpress with a completely custom template  theme.p  pSomeone has commented that the topic wasnt researched.  Unfortunately Ive spent lots of time researching it, the problem is that I think Im using the wrong terminology to describe what I need to find.  If anyone would care to give me the terminology or a good place to conduct further research even a few keywords I will be MORE than happy to go do that.p  pThank you for any help or tips to information I can learn from  p  pBrettp

I want to turn off the group as a whole. I can nest layersOCGs by separating into 2 arrays and inserting the list I want nested into the base list.p  pIf the first element of the nested array is a String, it creates a group in a tree structure. I can click the  to open and close the group, but there is no eye box to turn visibility on or off for the group.p  pIf the first element is not a string, it just uses the previous element in the array as the parent, complete with folder Icon and visibility eye to click, but while clicking the eye will turn of the parent layerOCG, it will not turn off the underlying nested layersOCGs.p  pThis may be fixed if I knew how to create data correctly.

Negative 63161 pI have discounts running on items if they are bought in a group. If one buys A,B,C categories they get a 10  discount and say they pick B,C,D categories they get a 15 discount. But what happens now is say there is A,B,C,D in the cart it becomes 2 rules. A,B,C and B,C,D whereas it should be just 1.  I cannot set the Stop further rule processing as Yes because then my users cannot buy 2 combos of exclusive items So I need to exclude the items which have already become a part of one shopping rule.  Similarly say I have a discount of 5  on purchase of A,B then picking 1 piece of A and 2 pieces of B gives a user 2 discounts.p

Negative 63161 pI am working on an android app, in which the first page is a homepage. On clicking on any item on the homepage, the user can view details in that item. The details are taken from an sqlite database and can be accepted or rejected in the app by the user. On accept or reject by the user, the detail gets deleted from the list of details. But, on clicking back button from the details page, when the user reaches the homepage again, there occurs this problem that when the user clicks on the same item again, it shows all the details without saving state.p  pE.g. if my item1 has 10 details within it..i view all the 10 details in the details page..then accept 2..so total remain 8..but when i click back and reach the homepage and again click on item1, it shows all 10 again...and does not record the change which occured when 2 were accepted.p  pHow can this be solvedp  hr  pThis is the code that we are working onp

Negative 63161 pIm trying to retrieve comments for statuses from Facebooks Graph API in REVERSE chronological order, that is the newest comments should be on top. I am not sure if this is even possible.p  pI know Facebook orders posts in chronologically descending order by default, and comments are chronologically ascending oldest on top by default. By default, I mean in Facebook.com and the way they are retrieved from the API.p  pUsing the Graph API I am able to retrieve statuses in descending order, but comments are returned in ascending order. Id like to get the comments in reverse order from the API without having to sort them in my program. The reason being is that the program is limited to the  of comments it will download, so setting the limitxx will actually retrieve the first xx comments, rather than the newest xx comments. This is no good for me because if a status has 500 comments, and xx100, it will always retrieve the same set of comments first 100 to be posted. p  pThe best parameter for the Html request that I can find is orderby which looks for a timedate param updatedtime, but this does not actually work since it is already ordered by the updatedtime but ascending. I would like to specify orderby descending updatedtime, if possible.p  pAny help will be appreciated.p

Negative 63161 pI have read lots of arguments about not using codethrowXcode in function signatures, and I think the way its specified in ISO C and implemented in current compilers its rather useless. But why compiler cannot simply strongenforcestrong exceptioncorrectness at compile time p  pIf I write functionmethod definition that contains codethrowA,B,Ccode in its signature, the compiler should not have many problems in figuring out if implementation of given function is exceptioncorrect. That means that function body hasp  ul lino codethrowcodes other than codethrow A throw B throw Ccodeli lino functionmethod call that have throwsignatures less restrictive than codethrow A,B,Ccodeli ul  p, at least outside codetrycatchcode catching other thrown types. If compiler raises error if these requirements are not met, then all functions should be safe and no runtime functions like codeunexpectedcode would be required. All this would be assured at compiletime.p  precodevoid fooA throw A   void fooAB throw A,B   void fooABC throw A,B,C    void bar throw A      throw A    ok     throw B    Compiler error      fooA       ok     fooAB      compiler error     fooABC     compiler error      try        throw A    ok        throw B    ok        throw C    Compiler error         fooA    ok        fooAB   ok        fooABC  compiler error      catch B  codepre  pThis would require that all nonC realm code was either codethrowcode specified by default codeextern Ccode should assume it by default, or if there is some exception interoperability then appropriate headers for C at least should be codethrowcodespecified as well. Failure to do so could be compared to using headers with different functionmethod return type in different compilation units. While its not producing warnings or errors, its obviously wrong  and as thrown exceptions are part of signature, they should also match.p  pIf we enforce such constrains it would have three effectsp  ul liIt would remove all those implicit codetrycatchcode blocks, otherwise required for runtime checking, thus improving exceptionhandling performance.li liThe argument that Exceptions are making our library too big, so we switch them off would disappear, as most of additional code lies in those unnecessary implicit throwcatch instructions at every function call. If code was properly codethrowcodespecified, most of it wouldnt be added by compiler.li liIt would make most of the programing world furious, as nobody ever seemed to like exceptions. Now, as these are actually usable, we need to learn how to use them.li ul  pIf we used some compatibility compiler flags for older code it wouldnt break anything, but as new exceptioncode would be quicker, there would be a good motivation not to write new code using it.p  pTo summarize my question Why such enforcement is not required by ISO C Are there any strong reasons for it not to be I always thought that exceptions are just another functions return value, but one that is governed automatically, so you can avoid writing functions likep  precodestdpairltint, boolgt str2intstdstring s int str2intstdstring s, bool ok codepre  pplus additional autodestruction of variables and propagation through multiple functions up the stack so you dont need code likep  precodeint doThis      int err0      [...]      if err  doThat         return err           [...]   codepre  pand if you can require function to codereturncode only the correct type, why cant you require it to codethrowcode itp  pWhy cant exception specifiers be better Why werent they made like I described from the startp  pPS I know there might be some issues with exceptions and templates  depending on answers to this question perhaps i will ask another one about it  for now let us just forget templates.p  pstrongEDITstrong in response to NicolBolasp  blockquote   pWhat kind of optimization could the compiler do with exception class X that it couldnt do with Yp blockquote  pComparep  precodevoid fooA throw A   void fooAB throw A,B   void fooABC throw A,B,C    void bar throw       try        fooA           if exception  A goto Acatch        fooAB           if exception  A goto Acatch           if exception  B goto Bcatch        fooABC           if exception  A goto Acatch           if exception  B goto Bcatch           if exception  C goto Ccatch          catch A   Acatch       [...]          catch B   Bcatch       [...]          catch C   Ccatch       [...]       codepre  pandp  precodevoid fooA   void fooAB   void fooABC    void bar      try        fooA           if exception  A goto Acatch           if exception  B goto Bcatch           if exception  C goto Ccatch           if exception  other return exception        fooAB           if exception  A goto Acatch           if exception  B goto Bcatch           if exception  C goto Ccatch           if exception  other return exception        fooABC           if exception  A goto Acatch           if exception  B goto Bcatch           if exception  C goto Ccatch           if exception  other return exception          catch A   Acatch       [...]          catch B   Bcatch       [...]          catch C   Ccatch       [...]       codepre  pHere I included some pseudocode that compiler would have generated no assembly level.

Negative 63161 pI would dearly love to get rid of the hideous EDMX blob that we are currently wrestling with in our project. Our project is database first, and currently we create the EDMX file using the awful and buggy EDM designer, from whence we generate DbContext and POCO entities using T4 templates. p  pAs the project has matured we find that we have very little difference between our database model and our entity model, essentially a 1to1 entity to table mapping which seems to be the mode that EF most prefers. Our only deviation from this is a single use of TableperType inheritance between four of our entities. This in itself has not prooved to be a good design and could well be disgarded.p  pMy question then is  we have no need of the EDMX file, we should be able to drive creation of our DbContext and entity classes directly from the database model, is there a T4 template that can do thatp  pI have found a hrefhttpwww.olegsych.com200912simplifyingentityframeworkdatadrivendesigncomment3529 relnofollowthis posta from Oleg Sych from a couple of years ago which provided T4 templates to accomplish this but the output is for ObjectContext not DbContext.

Negative 63161 pIve got a site built using a hrefhttpwww.coldbox.org relnofollowColdBoxa and am trying to remove the index.cfm from the URL. I have this working great on ColdFusion 9 running on IIS7 using the below web.config file, but cant for the life of me get it to work on CF10IIS7.5. The rewrite module is installed and SES URLs that include index.cfm i.e. index.cfmproduct1 work just fine. I know CF10 now runs on Tomcat instead of JRun and that out of the box Tomcat doesnt support SES URLs, but from what I understand, the CF team explicitly added support for them and indeed checking the web.xml file shows that to be true. I really dont believe this is a ColdBox specific issue, but rather something between CF10Tomcat and IIS7.5.p  pNOTE I dont have direct access to the web server, but am working with the hosting provider.

Negative 63161 pcodeLinkedHashMapcode looks brilliant to implement LRU Cache. It has some overheads in terms of linked list management and not thread safe but then it simplifies the implementation and I can take care of these in my code.p  pThe question I have, which I dont find answer so far about is how many elements LinkedHashMap removes from the list if removeEldestEntry is implemented and put finds the list full.p  pDoes it remove just one element or some percentage of the total size. My concern is if it removes just one element to put new element then its a real performance issue. As I see the rehash operations are very costly.p  pPlease someone suggest how it works and If I can manage these to be removed elements count using  InitialCapacity, LoadFactor or any other way.p

Negative 63161 pIn my universal application I have a master detail at the beginning. On the iPad it is just shown as a split view and when I change the interface orientation the autosizing works fine. But on the iPhone this doesnt work good enough in my detail view. So I want to have two different views for my DetailViewController that should have the exact same functionality, but I cant really get it to work properly. I tried to use two view controllers, but that didnt really do the job. I am using a storyboard by the way.p  pI thought I have found a solution by adding two views to my DetailViewController. Then I simply check the current orientation and set the recent view like thisp  precode voidtableViewUITableView tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPathNSIndexPath indexPath       Video currentVideo  [[self.xmlParser videos] objectAtIndexindexPath.row]      if [[UIDevice currentDevice] userInterfaceIdiom]  UIUserInterfaceIdiomPad         [self.detailViewController setDetailItemcurrentVideo]     else           if self.detailViewController               DetailViewController nextController  [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierDetail]             if [UIDevice currentDevice].orientation  UIDeviceOrientationPortrait                 [nextController setViewnextController.portraitView]             else                 [nextController setViewnextController.landscapeView]             [nextController setDetailItemcurrentVideo]             [self.navigationController pushViewControllernextController animatedYES]                        codepre  pThis works like it should, but now I face another problem. The two views contain exactly the same outlets, but I can only connect the outlets of either one of them to my DetailViewController class. So in one of the orientations I cant view my contents properly or I have to code everything twice what is exactly the thing I want to avoid.p  pDo have any ideas how I could handle this problemp  pThanks in advance p

We are writing our tests on Java 1.7.p  pWe can use Selenium to navigate to the protected page using the usernamepasswordsite2.tld URL and hence allow for access.p  pMy question is is there a way to let the RC use the credentials just whenever it needs to load a resource from the protected sitep  pSimply put, can it see URLs like http site2.tldimage.png as if they are http usernamepasswordsite2.tldp  prrufai Your edit does not make my question clearer, therefore I am reverting it in part. However, since you did misinterpret it, I believe a clarification is indeed necessary  I would like Selenium RC to actually read the files on site2.tld as if their location was http usernamepasswordsite2.tld.p
Negative 63161 pI came across a very interesting issue in IE9. When using filter alphaopacity or msfilter css property on a wrapping div the box model of the inner block elements get corrupted. In other words the collapsing of verticalmargin gets disabled and verticalmargin is added instead. Im facing this issue only in IE9. IE78 is not affected.p  pHeres a a hrefhttpjsfiddle.net9CrQG3jsFiddlea with the isolated issue. Use the trigger anchor to activate the class that includes filter alpha on the wrapping div. IE9 onlyp  pAny ideas why this is happeningp  pThanks in advancep

Negative 63161 pAm getting started using Entity Framework and have run into a problem.p  pSay I have 2 tables in my database. One called Agent that contains an ID and a password and another table called AgentDetail that contains more information about the Agent. However, there might not be a corresponding AgentDetail record for every Agent record.p  pI have these 2 classes to represent those 2 tablesp  precodepublic class Agent      public string AgentId  get set      public string Password  get set      public virtual AgentDetail AgentDetail  get set    public class AgentDetail      public string AgentDetailId  get set      public string AgentName  get set      public string Postcode  get set   codepre  pUsing EF I can add data to the database OK. I can also retrieve data OK when there is a corresponding record in both tables.p  precode        var agents  from a in context.Agents                      select a          return Viewagents.ToList codepre  pHowever I get a NullReferenceException in my view when rendering values within AgentDetail if that record doesnt exist in the AgentDetail table.p  pNow thats totally expected as there is no AgentDetail record.p  pMy question is how do I get EF to create an AgentDetail with empty values when the record doesnt exist in the table.p  pCan I add an empty child object in the LINQ query  something likep  precode        var agents  from a in rb.Agents                       select new                                                  AgentId  a.AgentId,                           Password  a.Password,                           AgentDetail  a.AgentDetail  null  new AgentDetail  a.AgentDetail,                       .ToList codepre  pthe above doesnt work however as I get the following messagep  pThe entity or complex type Models.AgentDetail cannot be constructed in a LINQ to Entities query.p

Negative 63161 pI am desgining an architecture of system. Java EESpringp  pThe main factor of this system is stronglow latencystrong.talking about 1 ms and less from end to endp  pWe have planned several components for this real time system. p  pMy question to you experts I know all the advantages of coupling and decouplingfail over, separation, maintenance, extension etc..p  pThe problem I am facing here is p  pFor example lets say  I have two diffrent applications on machine Aapp1 and application on Machine Bapp2.p  pa request must go through both machines. and final answer will be sent to the client after both machines processed the request.p  pThe integration latency between those two will surely be higher then having those apps under the same machinenetworking time, etc..p  pIn other hand I can update and maintenance each application on its own without being depended on the same machine. same goes for failover, clustering, load balancingp  pWhat would you advice me what should I consider  Latency vs decoupling and maintenancep  pthanks, ray.p
Negative 63161 pIm experimenting with the new AF to migrate away from Mapreduce. I have millions of objects like thisp  precode  id ObjectID,  owner 1,  tags [    text dog, score 5,     text cat, score 3,     text hamster, score1]     id ObjectID,  owner 2,  tags [    text cat, score 8,     text fish, score 4]  codepre  pand I want to do a report with count of all matches of cat and fish where the owner is X.p  pSo far I have my pipeline assuming input tags [cat, fish] looking likep  precode   match  owner X, in tags.text [cat, fish] ,    project text tags.text, ,    unwind text, ,    match text in tags [cat, fish] ,    group id text, total sum 1  codepre  pThe first match is to just narrow down to a subset of all these million objects  since I have an index on owner and tags.txt.p  pThis pipeline functions fine for small numbers of tags, but I need to be able to pass in 1001000 tags and get a quick result. It seems to be that it must be inefficient to project out and unwind all the tags, only to filter way 90 in the next match step. p  pIs there a more efficient way Maybe reorder the pipeline steps p

Negative 63161 pI love the effect that the initial smoothHeight has when the page loads. I hate the way it slowly reacts to a page resizing after the initial load. I would love to keep the effect for the initial page load, and then fall back to the default resizing without animation. I have been chasing this for hours. By setting the smoothHeight variable back to false at the end of the smoothHeight function itself I can switch the variable back to false after the initial animation, but this disables any resizing of the height after the initial load.  This feels like a very simple operation, but I cant figure it out. Thanks ahead of time for any ideasp  pBasically, when this block is executed once, it sets the height so that, even once the variable is changed back to false, the height is no longer flexible.p  pcodesmoothHeight functiondur          if vertical  fade            var obj  fade  slider  slider.viewport           dur  obj.animateheight slider.slides.eqslider.animatingTo.height, dur  obj.heightslider.slides.eqslider.animatingTo.height                codep

Negative 63161 por Using LocationInterceptionAspect and IInstanceScopedAspect togetherp  pUsing Postsharp Im trying to inject a property into a target class using IntroduceMember and then using the OnGetValue functionality of LocationInterceptionAspect dynamically give it a value on inspection.p  pOriginally I thought that Id need two separate aspects, one for the field injection and one for the location interception but managed to combine the two by implementing the IInstanceScopedAspect interface and inheriting from LocationInterceptionAspect.p  pThe problem is that if I set a breakpoint I will see the property thats been injected, but if I set another breakpoint in the OnGetValue method that gets fired for each property on the class I cant see it...p  pHeres some sample codep  precode[Serializable] class DALDecoratorWrapper  LocationInterceptionAspect, IInstanceScopedAspect      public override void OnGetValueLocationInterceptionArgs args              if args.LocationName  Type                      args.Value  computed value here                   args.ProceedGetValue           [IntroduceMemberOverrideAction  MemberOverrideAction.OverrideOrFail]     public String Type  get set  codepre  pI was also hoping there was a better way of doing this than overriding OnGetValue as thats called for each getter where really I want to only target the getter of the property thats been injectedp  pCheersp

Negative 63161 pIm having this issue on my Windows 7 machine where a call to MulticastSocket.receive in Java will hang indefinitely it never receives the packets when I try to listen in on a server connected to a non192.168.X.X network. Provided that the server is connected on the 192.168.X.X network, MulticastSocket.receive will not hang. Im fairly sure that this is a configuration issue on my Windows 7 machine, as it works on the other development systems at my workplace running Windows XP and Ubuntu 10.04. p  pAny help would be appreciated.p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pI figured out why MulticastSocket.receive was hanging indefinitely. What happened was that Windows Firewall was blocking the incoming packets from the network corresponding to my server. A quick fix to this problem was to disable Windows Firewall on that network in my case, I disabled Windows Firewall on my Public Network. After that, the MulticastSocket.receive was able to get the incoming packets.p
Negative 63161 pCurrently I have 2 databasesp  ol liPrimary default database, containing everything like users, posts etc. this one runs on PostgreSQL wie psycopg2li liSecondary geo database, containing only geo data this one runs on postgis 1.5li ol  pDjango and PG do not support crossdatabase relations for good reasons, I already know that, but I split my databases up, because I fear that the geo database is optimised for geo data and if I mix all data in one database the whole performance will suffer from this, plus I dont even know if I can have everyting in one database geo and normal data. But I want to relate data from the primary1 database to the secondary2 database.p  pIs this approach reasonable or is it completely wrong to split it upp

Negative 63161 pJust curious about the current trend to put clientside templates for singlepage Java applications in script tags in your HTML file.  Seems like an interesting approach, but is this considered a best practice or at least a better practice  I tried to come up with a list of advantages and disadvantages, but the list of bad seems to outweigh the good.  So the way I see it is thisp  pAdvantagesp  ol liOnly one request to get all templates vs. an individual async request for each template file.li ol  pDisadvantagesp  ol liCreates a potential merge troublespot  bottleneck file if all templates are in one locationli liA bit cumbersome to edit templates all in one fileli liA bit cumbersome to find the template you need vs. using a keyboard shortcut to open file.li liHave to wait until the DOM is ready before doing anything with a template.li ol  pIt also seems that with having them in script tags, you can precompile and cache your templates so youre only querying the DOM once to get each template.  However, couldnt you achieve the same effect using AMD  Require and a requiretext or dojotext  In the latter instance, youd be lazily loading each template only once.  You could then cache it and precompile it at that point.p  pI just am struggling to see the many advantages of templates in script tags.  Am I missing somethingp

Negative 63161 pIm building an app that has one master user through devise. This master user creates records of employees and items that were tracking. When a user wants to checkout a item, hell send a text to a twilio phone number and thatll create a new transaction of that item, either checking it in or checking it out. So I have three tables  employees, items, and transactions. Plan is to intercept these incoming texts, parse the phone number that it comes from, the item theyre texting about, and the code that they give, i.e. CI 12345 would Check In Item 12345, etc. Anyway, Im scaffolding this stuff up just to make sure that I can make these transactions within the web app by hand before I start messing with an API to create transaction records, but Im having a hard time associating the transactions with the items andor users. A transaction would need to have a boolean inout value, a phone number to match it up with the employee that is performing the action, and then an item number to associate it with an item being tracked. I keep getting errors saying that I dont have a method defined for transactions when trying to load up a transaction show view, so to speak. Im not sure whats going on here.

From time to time loggedin users stops can do any queries to the database, but its not a connection problem, I think just select statements cant return any rows.  On login users start receiving a message The System.Web.Security.SqlMembershipProvider requires a database schema compatible with schema version 1. And this is because the first query to the server is execution of the procedure dbo.aspnetCheckSchemaVersion, which check the schema version. The query is executed but its look like the select in the stored procedure cant return any rows. When I execute this procedure in the management studio it returns a correct value.

I understand that the compiler doesnt like to work with undefined structures.

I know that codevoidcode is a generic pointer and thus every pointer can be downcasted without issues, thats why I used it.p  pMaybe my understanding of structure declaration and codetypedefcode is not as good as I thought.

Negative 63161 pI had a brain meltdown over this problem last night. I started to debug my program after making sure there were no clear errors coming from my eclipse error check. Im using Jre7 by the way. Anyway, each time i stepped into my class calllets call it a the debugger would trip and say class not found. However if i just run the debug without stepping into anything, there is no exception. Also if i step over the class call line, the program still initiates the class and all its members, and doesnt throw any exception. It is only when i reach that initial call  classA a  new A  that it stops and throws an exception. It also did this for a subclass i made inside of A. I couldnt step into that class either. p  pCan anyone tell me what types of things can cause this I am a beginner so please dumb it down a little if you can.p

Negative 63161 pI was trying to use codeUITextView characterRangeAtPointcode in my code to get codeUITextRangescode at some codeCGPointscode within the textview. And then I used the codeUITextPositionscode from those codeUITextRangescode as arguments and used codeUITextView offsetFromPosition toPositioncode to get the offset.  It worked well in iOS 6.

Negative 63161 pThis is more of a theoretical question about performance and speed of queries and how they work in a Relational Database.p  pLets say I have a table with 100,000 rows, having a column called status.p  p10,000 have a status active, while 90,000 have status inactive.p  pIf I query using active.  Am I then really only querying the active rows by default  Or does it still have to scan all the rowsp  pWhat I mean is that will performance be affected depending on the amount of rows I have as inactive.p  pFor instance....if I have 10,000,000 rows inactive, and 10,000 active.  Will the queries on the active rows take the same amount of time wether I have 100,000 inactive, or 10,000,000 inactive, since Im discarding the 10,000,000 inactive rows by the active query.p  pHopefully Im explaining myself properly.p  pBasically Im asking is if the active row count stays the same, does the query always take the same amount of time, since Im not really looking at the inactives.p

Negative 63161 pIve been assigned the task of importing about 180 csv files into an access 2007 database.  These files have been put together over the years and will be put into 1 of 3 folders.  I have not set up any data checks or restrictions to these tables such as primary keys, validation rules, or relationships.  That will be done once the data has been imported.  The data contained in these files are from a survey which has changed over the years.  This change has caused the fields to change.  The order of them has changed or sometimes a field is there and sometimes it is not.  I do have a list of all the fields possible though and what table each csv file should be imported to, and know that all these fields can be text.  p  pHere is my problem  Not knowing what the order of the columns or if a column will exist, is it possible to run a function to import these text files into their relative tables by mapping each column in the text file to its associated column in the access table  p  pEach text file has headers which is useful to see shat they actually are, but there is no text qualifier which can be very annoying when dealing with id codes consisting entirely of numbers.  Below is what Ive tried so far.  It gets the file location from a function elsewhere, adds each filename in that location to a collection, then for each file in that collection it tries to import it into its relative field.p  precode    Get file names from the folder and store them in a collection temp  Dirlocation amp .

Negative 63161 pI am new to professional development of UI application. I wonder what the normal approach to decide the layout of the each UI element.  Do people hardcode the size elements according to the design time monitor size And later scale the UI size dynamically Or do people use some dynamical approach to set each UI element proportional according to screen size I meant if theres a method dynamically to set controls size proportional to screen size and that ratio is hardcoded by programmer. Obviously, Dockpanel or viewbox are automatic adjusting. Or do people usually decided size upon design time Or therere other common approach p

Dylib and the app are two different targets in the same XCode project, so that in the simulator I can correctly debug the dylib. When I run the app on the device I can correctly remote debug the app but I cant debug the code of the shared library. Since I dont know what to expect I cant understand if I set something wrong in the Build settings or this is a limitation of lldb when remote debugging. Is there something I should check or dop

Negative 63161 pSo, heres the deal. I have an interface called IBehavior. Each one of my Entitys has a variable codeprivate IBehavior behaviorcode. Each Entity also has a variable codepublic string Behaviorcode. Upon loading my entitys the string is filled from an xml file. Subsequently a function called codeinitcode is called on all entitys. This method takes the string and uses this line of code to call the desired constructor codeType.GetTypeBehavior.GetConstructorType.EmptyTypes.Invokenullcode.p  pUnfortunately, the Invoke method returns something of type Object, and the behavior variable wont accept this without a cast. I have tried this approach codebehavior  IBehaviorType.GetTypeBehavior.GetConstructorType.EmptyTypes.Invokenullcode.p  pAll this did was tell me that my codebahaviorcode variable was null and therefore this could not happen. Im probably using codeGetConstructorcode incorrectly.

Negative 63161 pI am writing a program in python. I am using about a dozen modules. Currently I have placed them in the functions themselves.

But my dilemma and question comes when I want to fetch related data from one model to another and show it using QML components. I find three waysp  ul lipCreate a new model mixing devices and channels with roles for all data such as channel id, name, quality, and ... source device name, mac, etc. I dont like this solution.pli lipCreate signals macSelectedChanged into view, and load context properties with data deviceSelected from controller as response for signal emitted.pli lipFind data related using javascript into view. I have a small idea how to do it and IMHO it is the most consistely way, but performance would be reduced.pli ul  pWhich of these ways is the best one Is there other better Im looking for a answer in terms of usability and performance.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 63161 pI am doing an algorithm for a hill climbing search, and for some reason, the stack that Im supposed to have at the end of the loop seems to be overwritten with the last iteration of the state that the loop generated.p  pBasically, here is a rundown of what this algorithm is doingp  pThis algorithm is being used to solve the N queens problem. All of the underlying code with the state class works perfectly fine. With this algorithm, it iterates through all possible successor states of the current state. It stores the next successor state within the neighborState variable as seen in the code below. If a state cost is less than the current cost, it will add the neighborState with that new low cost into a neighborNode and store that into a stack. Any new min values that get detected will wipe the stack and insert the new lowest minimum nodes.p  pIve done a few tests within the loop to see what the outputs look like from what is being inserted into the stack. All of them seem to be correctly outputting. However, when I am outside the loop and check the stack, all the nodes in the stack have their states replaced to the last generated successor state from the loop. It seems that in every node that has the neighborState stored, each time the neighborState updates, it changes all the node neighborState values as well. I just cant seem to find a way to fix this though.p  pSome advice as to how I can fix this would be greatly appreciated p  pNote Disregard the code after the for loop starting at the if statement, as it is still incomplete.p  pHere is the codep  precodeimport java.util.Random import java.util.Stack  public class HillClimber   private LocalSearchNode current private int shoulderSearchStepsAllowed

For emNexus 7em, the drawing part takes about 170 ms, although for the emGalaxy Nexusem it takes 459 ms. The most time consuming operation is the loading of the texture and especially the codetexImage2Dcode call. I have read that there are devices with chips that are slow on codetexImage2DcodecodetexSubImage2Dcode functions but how can someone tell which are those devices and how can I avoid to use those functions to achieve the same resultp  pThank you in advance.p  p EDIT the codeglDrawArraysGLTRIANGLESTRIP, 0, 4code call seems to also be significantly slower in the phone device. Why is this happening How could I avoid itp
Negative 63161 pI have a simple application which is a table view TV1 that gets populated by the user tapping the plus button in the navigation bar. The user gets taken to an Add Entry screen where tapping on the name text field brings up another Table View TV2 for the user to add existing entries, search for existing entries or add a new entry. This works really well and delegates ensures that what I select in the new Table view TV2 populates the Name Text Field. p  pWhat I want to achieve is the other way around also if a user has the name text field already populated and clicks on it to bring up the TV2, I want the search bar to already be populated with the string that was passed through while ensuring the searching still works. p  pFor example, if I have the nameTextField with John, when I click on the nameTextField and get taken to the TV2, I want the searchBar.text to say John, but also for the searching to now only show entries with John in the name, just like it would be if I start typing the name John. p  pI am using Core Data and NSFetchedResultsController. p  pIn the prepaeForSegue of the Add Entry, I am doing thisp  precodeif [self.nameTextField.text length] gt 0      [envylopeNameTextFieldTableViewController setSelectedNameself.nameTextField.text]  codepre  pIn the TV2, the setSelectedName method isp  precode voidsetSelectedNameNSString selectedName      selectedName  selectedName     self.nameAddSearchBar.text  selectedName      [self searchBarself.nameAddSearchBar textDidChangeselectedName]  codepre  pThe last line in there is a trial by me because that method is what gets called when I start searching, so I thought I could call that. I tried it without it and with self.nameAddSearchBar.text  self.selectedName and selectedName and nothing the searchBar does not get populated. p  pWith a breakpoint, I can see that selectedName  John and selectedName  John, but self.nameAddSearchBar.text  nil. p  pI can imagine Im one or two lines of code away, but Im just not sure how to proceed. p  pAny assistance would be really great. p  pThanks, p

Negative 63161 pjQuery BBQ noob question I have downloaded jQuery BBQ 1.2.1 and Im trying to use it with jQuery 2.1.0. BBQ works in the sense that it does what I want it to do, but Ive noticed an error message in the console. Ive tracked it down to what appears to be a compatibility issue. Heres a sample HTML page that produces the errorp  precodeltDOCTYPE HTMLgt lthtmlgt     ltheadgt         lttitlegtexamplelttitlegt     ltheadgt     ltbodygt         example     ltbodygt     ltscript src..jslibjquery2.1.0.min.jsgtltscriptgt     ltscript src..jslibjquery.babbq.min.jsgtltscriptgt lthtmlgt codepre  pIn Firefox the console error is codeTypeError f is undefinedcode. In Chrome the error is different codeUncaught TypeError Cannot read property msie of undefinedcode.p  pIve noticed jQuery BBQ is pretty old. Is there a newer rev of jQuery BBQ Or is there some newer replacement libraryp  pUPDATEp  pIm using jQuery BBQ because a google search sent me to this previously answered question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4197591parsingurlhashfragmentidentifierwithjavascriptParsing URL hashfragment identifier with JavaScripta. The real issue Im trying to solve is the same as the linked question to respond to changes in the hash portion of the URI and to parse that fragment.p  pIt turns out that for my purposes so far, I can eliminate jQuery BBQ and write a couple of lines of code to grab the hash string and remove the hash signp  precode    window.bindhashchange, function          var hashString  window.location.hash           hashString  hashString.replace,         myEventHandlerhashString      codepre  pSo that will work for now. Its pretty simple and its one less module dependency, so winwin. I suppose thats why there were no responses to a jQueryBBQ question, ehp

Negative 63161 pI am trying to replicate the Windows Phone Ui in an AngularJS app. Here is an a hrefhttpwww.expertreviews.co.ukgalleryfeatures1295629designingwindowsphone8177979 relnofollowexamplea of what a Windows Phone Ui looks like.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comiBcEp.jpg altWindows Phone Uip  h2Infinite Swipeh2  pOne interesting thing about it is the panels are infinitely swipeable. You can keep swiping and end up back at the first panel.p  pTo achieve the infinite swipe, I duplicate the first and last panels and add them before and after the original panels like this p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comIqXqF.jpg altCopied Panelsp  pIf you swipe to a copied panel like 3 or 1p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comA1q6X.jpg altSwipe to copied panelp  pyou are redirected to the real panel immediately after the swipe finishes. This happens without the user even knowing because there is no animation.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOdPpl.jpg altRedirect to actual panelp  h2Problemh2  pThe problem is that the panels can have codengcontrollercode, codengrepeatcode, codengmodelcode, or any number of things that create scope within them. When I duplicate the markup a new scope is created that starts out identical to the original but does not stay in sync. How do I keep the panel data in syncp  pOR, is there another way to achieve this that does not involve duplicating markupp  h2Ideash2  ol liOne idea I had was moving the DOM elements around instead of duplicating. I noticed significant lag with this strategy and if there are only two panels, this breaks down because the nonselected panel either needs to go before the current panel or after.emThis was not acceptable to me because of the perceived performance lossemli liAnother option is delaying the movement of the panel contents until after the swipe is completed. You would still see the panel titles, but the content would be invisible until you finish swiping. Then, I can determine which panel is now current and animate it coming in from the proper direction depending on the direction of the swipe.li liA third option is using blank panels with a loading spinner as the duplicated or buffer panels. If you swipe to a panel that is not one of the originals, you would see a flash of the loading spinner until you are moved to the actual panel.li ol  pNone of these options are ideal, so Im looking for other ideas. But if there arent any good options, 2 seems like the best plan to me.p

Negative 63161 pI am using video.js to show video content.

Negative 63161 pAlright so I have a MySQL Database setup with a bunch of usernames, passwords, and other details. I have one administrator section on the site that I want to be able to edit the users information when needed. p  pSo far I have a page called presidentadmin.php code below, which displays a table with the name, username, and password of the user, as well as a link to update the user. I have the table working correctly, it displays the information and all. The update link, takes the users ID in the table, then sends it to a page called StudentEdit.php code below which then retrieves the ID of the User, and fills three text fields with the username, password, and name just fine. It works. p  pSo I fill out the fields to test and see if it will let me update the variables in the database, and press submit which goes to a page called StudentUpdate.php code below. The page connects to the database, and uses and if to display and error if it will not update. It goes through fine and says it successfully update.... But it indeed does not. Can someone look at my code and help me out.p  pIve been stuck on this for hours. Please Note this is a code snip, its actually secured and has more to the page. Also Im a teen trying my best here...

Negative 63161 pI have been working a Razor templeting system but am running into a consistent syntax error. In many of my .cshtml files I am swapping between .cs and .js multiple times on one line of code which causes the intellisense get confused. p  pExamplep  precodeltscript typetextjavascript iddtscriptgt ... if string.IsNullOrWhiteSpaceColumnDefs      columnDefs model.ColumnDefs,  ... ltscriptgt codepre  pIn the above line the trailing comma after ColumnDefs is a syntax error, however when the .cshtml file compiles and I render the template the rendered code is correct. This syntax error holds for alternate ways of generating the code...p  precodeif string.IsNullOrWhiteSpaceColumnOrder      lttextgtorder model.ColumnOrderlttextgt,  or if string.IsNullOrWhiteSpaceColumnOrder      lttextgtorder model.ColumnOrder,lttextgt  codepre  pSince the template generates the correct view I have been slow about addressing the syntax error, but I am getting tired of all of the red squiggly lines. So my question is what is the correct way to splice .cs and .js to avoid incorrectly reported syntax errors throughout the razor file.p  pUpdate  Let me expand on this scenario a little. There is no controller, this system is a stand alone library. The templeting system is product agnostic and is part of a Domain Specific Language for common plugins. The model.ColumnDefs is actually a json object that renders into the following code. p  precodecolumnDefs [sortablefalse,targets[0,3],   visiblefalse,targets[0,7],   searchablefalse,targets[0],   nameId,targets0,   nameEmail,targets1,   nameName,targets2,   nameIsAdmin,targets3,   nameSalary,targets4,   namePosition,targets5,   nameHired,targets6,   nameNumber,targets7],    codepre  pIt can not be wrapped in  or  otherwise the plugin is not able to parse the code. p

Negative 63161 pI cant really find a satisfying solution for that problem. I have a nlayers application p  ol liUIli liPresentation Domain Model used as DTO, ViewModels are then presentedli liBusiness Layer Domain Modelli liRepository and DAL Data Modelli ol  pMy problem is that I need to work with full objects in my business layer. However I cant figure out what is the best way to load them. The question may look stupid  and perhaps it is  but Im very puzzled by it. I have the following classes just to illustratep  precodepublic class Library      int ID getset     string Name getset     Book[] Novels getset     Book[] TextBooks getset   public class Book      int ID getset     Library[] SalePoints getset     string Name getset     string Type getset  codepre  pAnd I have two Service Methods LoadLibrary and LoadBook whose aim is to populate these respective models. My problem is that it looks like I will get into an infinite loop. Ill explain myself right now.p  pI have preloaded domain models coming from the Repositories The repositories convert the Data Models into domain models using valueinjecter unflatenning, so basically the simple fields int, string, etc.., are populated in the resulting domain model but the IEnumerable properties are not. Thats why Im finishing to load them in the Service Layer. There are also two reaons why I cant fully load them in my repositories  1 Im using a generic repository and 2 The loading logic relay on business rulesp  pLet us say that I do the following p  precodepublic class LibrairiesProcessor      public Library LoadLibrairyObjectint ID              Library l  UnitOfWork.LibraryRepo.GetByIDID  Only retrieve simple properties, here it will get the Name and the ID properties          l.Novels  UnitOfWork.BookRepo.Getbgtb.LibrairyIDl.ID ampamp b.TypeNovel         l.TextBooks UnitOfWork.BookRepo.Getbgtb.LibrairyIDl.ID ampamp b.TypeTextBook           forint i0iltl.Novels.Counti                      l.Novels[i]  BooksProcessor.LoadBookObjectl.Novels[i].ID                codepre  pand p  precodepublic class BooksProcessor      public Book LoadBookObjectint ID              Book b  UnitOfWork.LibraryRepo.GetByIDID  Only retrieve simple properties, here it will get the Name and the ID properties           b.SalesPoint   Get From repo using the Unit of work          forint i0iltb.SalesPoint.Counti                      b.SalesPoint[i]  LibrairyProcessor.LoadLibraryObjectb.SalesPoint[i].ID                 codepre  pIsnt there an infinite Loop  LoadLibraryObject calling LoadBookObject and vice versa... And especially when you come to the book whose SalePoint is the librairy who triggered LoadBookObject... at best the same work is done twice, but I really suspect that it will never end. p  pSo Im wondering if Im doing the things right. My goal is to have fully loaded objects to avoid wondering if the object is enough loaded before using it, but Im not sure of the solution Ive came up with. How do you usually achieve that  p  pIt looks like a trivial issue but seriously I cant figure out how to load my stuff. I feel like I have a dilemma p  p1 Manually Populating all the properties and sub properties by using UnitOfWork.Repository, but I will have a lot of code and a lot of redundant code.p  p2 Live with partially loaded domain models with some properties set to null, but I really dont want that. And since Im not working with EF objects directly since my domain model is complex, I cant use their lazy loading stuff.p  p3Call the Service LoadObject Methods from one LoadObjectMethod to an other, to avoid code redundancy, but it looks like Im introducing a lot of recursivity.p  pHow should I handle that  p  pThanks p

Negative 63161 pI want to make an app which could send message to a particular mobile phone which has the same application by using IP address of the receiver. Assume that we know the IP address of the receiver, there is no need to first find the IP address of the receiver.

The ultimate goal is to use another partition on the same physical disk.

Negative 63161 pI have a SQL table structure dilemma.p  pI currently have three tablesp  precodeStore   SID   Desc   Relative   RID   Desc   Job   JID   Desc   codepre  pThe codeStorecode table will be used to populate a Drop Down. It contains about a dozen rows representing various chain stores that may be located in one or multiple states. I need to be able to populate a drop down based on the state of the person in the application.p  pThe codeRelativecode table will also be used to populate a drop down after a value is chosen in the codeStorecode drop down. It contains about a dozen rows representing relative types e.g. son, daughter, mother etc.. I need to be able to populate this drop down based on the codeStorecode chosen and the state of the person in the application. To give an example, say a codeStorecode allows employees to hire their own codemothercode or codefathercode relatives, but in state X they only allows them to hire their codemothercode I know its an odd example, but its just for understanding in this case I want the box to populate with codemothercode and codefathercode in all states but X, where it would populate with codemothercode only.p  pFinally, the codeJobcode table will be used to populate a list of jobs there are about 30 rows in the table. List list will depend on the Store and the State because jobs my be state specific andor store specific and would populate after the codeStorecode or perhaps the codeRelativecode drop down was chosen.p  pI have the following table that could work to allow what I want to happenp  precode  State  SID  RID  JID   codepre  pWhere I would join to this table when populating the drop downs and the list, but it doesnt really seem optimal, and it could have quite a few rows. Is there another structuring of tables that anyone would feel is more appropriate Any ideas are appreciated.p

As near as I can tell, when you initiate a drag on a toolbar, any toolbar items on other toolbars which are covered by the toolbar youre dragging get removed from their current position in the visual tree, and then presumably added back when theyre made visible again.p  pWhen theyre removed from the visual tree again, thats what I think is happening, they also lose access to the ToolBarToggleButton and ToolBarButton styles, because those are defined in the Styles.xaml resource dictionary which is added in ToolBarsView.xaml.p  pHowever, if you define those same styles globally, then it works  presumably, even though theyre no longer children of ToolBarsView, they still have access to the global resources.p  pSo... Ive added a new property, IModule.GlobalResourceDictionaries, which allows each module to declare any resource dictionaries that should be added at the global scope. The ToolBars module makes use of this.p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comtgjonesgeminiissues67issuecomment60040008 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comtgjonesgeminiissues67issuecomment60040008ap

Negative 63161 pIve tried searching here, but could not find a answer to my question I apologize if I missed it.p  pLet me set the stage. I have a solution with two sites and two class librariesp  ul liClassLibrary CommonFooli liClassLibrary SiteFooLib has referense to CommonFooli liSite SiteFoo has referense to CommonFoo and SiteFooLibli liSite AdminFoo has referense to CommonFooli ul  pThe sites are using their own Application Pool lets call them SiteFooPool and AdminFooPool.p  pIm also using a external library, EO.Pdf EssentialObjects PDF that is currently references in SiteFoo only, for generating PDF files. But in the future AdminFoo might also need it.p  pMy question is this, will the SiteFooPool grow in memory if I move EO.Pdf to CommonFoo Or will it remain the same since it still in the same application pool, even if SiteFooLib also references CommonFoop  pI know the AdminFooPool will grow in memory.p  pThanks, Seke.p

I now ask the user to input a value, say x, which is then used in a while loop. It passes the x value through the recursive fib function, appends this new value to a list and then decrements f by 1.  Then I used list.reverse to reverse the list so that the numbers appear in ascending order and I then print the list.  This list has spaces between each number though, and I dont want that.  Is there a solution to this p

Negative 63161 pI am trying to make a Java JDialog where symbols are displayed in a tableish way. In fact something similar to charmap for windows img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comuysgI.png altenter image description herep  pBut I ran into some issuesp  ol lipI need the JDialog to be resizable so I cant choose to have a table as display, because it needs to be dynamically scaled.To clarify I mean not just the adjustment of the width of every cell, but the actual amount of the cells in the rowcolumnpli lipThe symbols obviously need to be wrapped in some sort of listener friendly component. But if I choose JButtons, everything looks wrong, because of the different character width in pixel.pli lipSince I have to loop through the symbols to create JButtons I can only make Objects with no name.

Negative 63161 pI have a Spring data project which is pulling data from an AWS DynamoDB using a hrefhttpsgithub.commichaellavellespringdatadynamodb relnofollowhttpsgithub.commichaellavellespringdatadynamodba. The project is happily doing what its designed to do  pulling lists of data from the data source.p  pBut now I want to add another endpoint to this application  one thats not based on pulling data from the data source using the Repository class, but on describing the data model itself. I want to use the existing domain models and instead of producing an endpoint that shows a list of records, I want to list the attributes of the model and their data type.p  pSpring data seems clever enough to provide something like this out of the box, but I cant find any information about it. Is there such a capability of the core libraryp  pIf not, how can I go about adding a new endpoint to a Spring data project that isnt based on CRUD of a data model Are there any good examples of doing this Is there even simply an example of having an endpoint with static content, which doesnt inherit from the Repository class p  pThanksp

Negative 63161 pThis is a little bit difficult to describe but Ill try my best. Now I have first an string of a class name, which is actually a custom actor class extends the akka Actor. And to instantiate it, use the following code to inject ThreadLocal during instantiatep  precodeobject helper      private val context  new ThreadLocal[Option[String]]     def createContext[T lt Actor]s String, creator gt T T           context.setSomes         val r  creator         context.setNone         r       codepre  pAnd then I try to start the actor from a string of classname like followingp  precodeval myclassname  com.myorg.mypkg.myactor val myclazz  Class.forNamemyclassname asSubclass classOf[Actor] val props  Props  helper.createContextmycontext  myclazz.newInstance  val act  system.actorOfprops act  some message codepre  pThis will be OK for a normal actor with default mailbox type. But when I define a class with Stash mixed in, due to the problem of ClassTag cant figure out the correct type parameter. When calling asSubclass, the Stash trait information is lost, and actorOf call will throw out an exception of DequeBasedMailbox required, got akka.dispatch.UnboundedMailboxMessageQueue.p  pProps.applyClass[], args can resolve this problem but that will not allow an injecting of instantiate. Both props.create with creator and props.apply with creator function will require a type parameter extends Actor, and that cant be fulfilled due to the class is reflected from string. Any ideap

Negative 63161 pI have a website wordpress which currently supports login via Facebook. That is accomplished by the JS SDK. I had 0 epxperience on facebooks API so im still trying to figure out how and where im going.p  pNow i want to do various checks before i let the user do some stuff. For example to rate a specific item only if he has attended an event, or liked the webpage etc etc.p  pIm doing pretty good so far but i was wondering if the above actions or checks if you like should be a part of the servers side.p  pI wanna give them the option to attend or decline an event too, but say i output 5 events, ill have to send 5 calls to the FB graph and do some searching on the clients side so that i can use the button according to his status on the event.p  pIm worried that this is going to affect the clients side a lot.p  pAnother option would be to use the JS SDK for login purposes only and then the PHP one for the various checks and other outpus.p  pI am more experienced in PHP overall than JS and im still trying to decide which way to go.p  pThanks a lotp

Negative 63161 pIve been doing quite a bit of research and am coming to a conclusion Id rather just implemented everything with dumb old codescandircode and codeforeachcode instead of going the iterator way.p  pBasically, I need a way to get contents of directories  optionally sorted, optionally recursive and optionally filtered by file name. Which IMO are the most basic functionality you would expect from any somewhat sophisticated file system traverser.p  pWell it turns out, neither codeRecursiveDirectoryIteratorcode nor codeFilesystemIteratorcode support sorting strongorstrong filtering. One has to wrap them in a class that extends codeArrayObjectcode to achieve sorting  or codeFilterIteratorcode for filtering. So to achieve both you have to write strongtwostrong classes wrapping everything in a myriad of levels and the code ends up looking outlandish and overcomplicated.p  pAm I missing something about the approach, or should I scratch my progress and rewrite everything in 20 lines in simple stupid codeifelseforeachcode codep

Negative 63161 pIm working on a private API for a mobile app that Im developing. Ive protected this API from the public using OAuth2.0.p  pA part of OAuth2.0 is the user decision dialog, a dialog thats rendered to ask the user whether or not the server is allowed to perform requests on their behalf.p  pThe only issue is, this means my login flow isnt smooth. You enter your user credentials in the login form and then youre redirected and asked if you want the server to perform on your behalf. But this doesnt make much sense as the act of the user logging in MEANS they want the server to perform on their behalf.p  pI understand this for public APIs, for example, it makes sense for Facebook to ask the user if my server can use their details, but how do I avoid asking the user if the server can use their details as theyre logging in to a private APIp

Negative 63161 pI am using the a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comyoutubeandroidplayerdownloads relnofollowYouTube API v3a and have the thumbnail videos for a codeListcode working nicely, and when you click a video in the list, it pops open a video box over the list that plays the video. This part works. But the video box was created as part of the codeAPIcode library Im assuming and so its fullscreen button in the box itself is clicked to get it into fullscreen. However, when I go to fullscreen, the video disappears and it is blank. No crash or anything, just blank. My initialization works fine. I get the codeerrorReasoncode value of codeSUCCESScode when I log it. So I dont know what else could be causing this blank.p  pIn some other codeYouTube APIcode code I find online, they use an codeIntentcode to go into fullscreen mode, but this is not what the video list class from the codeYouTubecode sample uses, so I dont know if thats needed somehow or not. The codeYouTubecode sample works perfectly as a list, it shows the video list and then seamlessly goes into fullscreen landscape mode when you click that tiny expand button on the video box. p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comUJa5G.jpg altVideo box over list itemsp  pDoes it seem like I am missing anything Keep in mind, the video box and the fullscreen mode are both fragments, and are created programmatically, not in the codeUIcode.

Negative 63161 pIm experiencing some sort of issue trying to compile a perfectly windowslinux tested mpiopenmp software I wrote my own. Ive managed to install and set to work the ompadapted version of clang, and it works flawlessly in a simple omp hello world Ive prepared.

This version MPIonly of the code has been compiled with no issue.p  pNow comes my real dilemma. Ive reverted back the omp sections of my code, and tried to compile it with both MPI and openMP flags mpic wrapper with ompclang forced in and fopenmp flag added.

Negative 63161 pI know that browsers originally spoofed user agents in order to allow for feature detection. But I am wondering why they emstillem do so. I dont think user agent spoofing has a place in the modern era of standards compliance what is basically a browser nirvana for web developers compared to the situation during the infancy of the web.p  pSomeone will probably say that its for backwards compatibility for all the old code out there. Is that the only reason After all this time I think browser vendors would be looking beyond those sites with old code. Is this being worked on, or are these user agents just forgotten relics from tougher times for browsersp  pAdditionally, most feature detection these days seems to be done with JavaScript, which makes part of the feature detection use case for a user agent irrelevant.p

Negative 63161 pI have a Scala class codeComponentBuildercode which deals with creating actors and initializing them. It has a field codesystemcode corresponding to the codeActorSystemcode among other things.p  pNow, Id like to test it using codeTestKitcode  intercept logs which actors produce and check them. If I try to use regular codeEventFiltercode I can see the log which my actors produce in stdout, but the codeEventFiltercode doesnt catch them, I guess because they are in a different codeActorSystemcode.p  pOne solution I thought of was to make codeComponentBuildercode a subclass of codeActorSystemcode and pass all the codeAScodecommands to its field. I didnt manage to do it, due to protected methods that return codeInternalActorRefcode, but anyway Im not sure if itll work then, as there will be 2 actor systems anyway.p  pI also tried to pass some messages from testing class to the actor and wait and check the results. This results in replying to the codedeadLetterscode, probably for the same reason  the inner codeActorSystemcode doesnt know about the outer one.p  pI will appreciate any solution you may have.p

But in the codeoperatorltcode no two codeDatacode objects are ever compared whose h values are same 1 compared to 2, 2 compared to 3, 3 compared to 4 and so on. So the codeoverlapcode variable is always codefalsecode. The outcome of codesortcode would be different if codeDatacode objects whose h values are same got compared  but that never happenedp  pAny explanation of this behavior of compilerp

When I uncomment these sections of the code, however, Im seeing some behavior that I dont understand.  In this case, I see the client connect to the server and send data to it.  On the server side, the code appears to hang inside ReadCallback.  To better illustrate this, when the code sections I mentioned previously are commented out, I see thisp  precodeClient output  Socket connected to 127.0.0.125981 Sent 100 bytes to server.   Server output  Waiting for a connection... Waiting for a connection... Inside ReadCallback... Inside ReadCallback... Received 100 bytes from client... codepre  pAs you can see from this output, when the server receives the 100 bytes of client data, I see two calls to ReadCallback.  So now I uncomment the aforementioned code and run it again.  This time, I seep  precodeClient output  Socket connected to 127.0.0.125981 Sent 100 bytes to server. Inside ReceiveBytes...   Server output  Waiting for a connection... Waiting for a connection... Inside ReadCallback... codepre  pThis time, my client sends 100 bytes of data to the server, sets the sendDone ManualResetEvent and then goes into ReceiveBytes.  On the server side, I see a single call to ReadCallback and nothing else.  That leads me to believe that the server didnt properly finish reading the data from the client although Im not sure why.  What am I missingp

Negative 63161 pI have a very very irritating bug in my code that just doesnt seem to show itself.p  pThe situation I am using 3 different websockets to connect to 3 different websocketservers through localhost. So client A connects to server A and so on... The client cycles through the connections to make and tries each one in order. If it fails or succeeds, it goes to the next one. If the connection failed, the connection to make it placed at the back of the queue. I switch to the next one in the list using both the onopen and onclose function.p  pThe problem I am using the following code snippet to start a connection from the clientp  precodethis.ws  new WebSocketthis.url this.ws.parent  this this.ws.onopen  this.onOpen this.ws.onmessage  this.onMessage this.ws.onerror  this.onError this.ws.onclose  this.onClose codepre  pThe this object is a wrapper object in this case. The functions supplied are all found and correct.p  pWhat happens is, the connection is created with the server. The server sends a very basic handshake reply. I wiresharked the situation and am 100 sure the handshake is received by the client it is ACKed by the TCP connection. However, the onopen function is not called and the websocket seems to stay in the connecting state. If I wait really long, I can get a timeout on the handshake. If I close the server, I get an error the connection has reset.p  pThis problem is random. Sometimes when you start the client, it will work and all 3 connections are made succesfully. Sometimes, it fails at the first attempt to connect to the first server. Sometimes the first connection is successfull and the second fails and so on.p  pThe problem shows itself under Windows with Opera, Chrome and Internet Explorer.p  pI also tried this without cycling through a list of connections to make but just let each socket retry its connection on its own onclose. Doesnt fix anything either.p  pCan someone please end my suffering The last thing I can think of, is that each javascript engine is just broken which, of course, is very unlikely.p  pOne situation which I used to, more or less, force the problem most of the time doesnt work everytime is to start the server and than open the page in the client. This causes the connection on A and B to fail and C to succeed on its first try but than it hangs most of the times.p  pIs it possible that the bug is caused by the fact that another websocket has just failed and the next one hangs because of some reason of the previous failed onep  pCode on a failed close to try reconnect laterp  precodeSOCKETSTOCONNECT.addToConnectobject.parent SOCKETSTOCONNECT.tryToConnectNext codepre  pCode on a succesfull open to try and connect nextp  precodeSOCKETSTOCONNECT.tryToConnectNext codepre  pCode to know which to connect to still addconnect takes the wrapper websocket objectp  precodefunction SocketsToConnect      this.toConnect  []      this.addToConnect  functionwebsocket          this.toConnect.pushwebsocket           this.tryToConnectNext  function          forvar i 0 i lt this.toConnect.length i              console.logthis.toConnect[i]                   var next  this.toConnect.shift          ifnext              next.connect                codepre  pGlobal variablep  precodevar SOCKETSTOCONNECT  new SocketsToConnect codepre  pWrapper websocket objectp  precodefunction Websocketname, ipaddress, port, onOpen, onMessage, onError, onClose      this.name  name     this.ipaddress  ipaddress     this.port  port     this.url  wsipaddressport     this.connected  false     this.onOpen  onOpen     this.onMessage  onMessage     this.onError  onError     this.onClose  onClose      this.connect  function                                  this.ws  new WebSocketthis.url                                 this.ws.parent  this                                 this.ws.onopen  this.onOpen                                 this.ws.onmessage  this.onMessage                                 this.ws.onerror  this.onError                                 this.ws.onclose  this.onClose               this.sendMessage  function message                             console.logSending over ws[  this.name  ]   message                            this.ws.sendmessage                              this.sendJSONObject  function jsonObject                              this.sendMessageJSON.stringifyjsonObject                                 this.close  function                      console.logClosing websocket[  this.name  ]                     this.ws.close                    codepre  pEDIT The websocket handshake I wiresharkedp  precodeGET  HTTP1.1 Host 127.0.0.19163 Connection Upgrade Pragma nocache CacheControl nocache Upgrade websocket Origin null SecWebSocketVersion 13 UserAgent Mozilla5.0 Windows NT 6.3 WOW64 AppleWebKit537.36 KHTML, like Gecko Chrome42.0.2311.135 Safari537.36 AcceptEncoding gzip, deflate, sdch AcceptLanguage nlNL,nlq0.8,enUSq0.6,enq0.4 SecWebSocketKey U0WPFXITDtQAljGSYxeyw SecWebSocketExtensions permessagedeflate clientmaxwindowbits   HTTP1.1 101 WebSocket Protocol Handshake Upgrade websocket Connection Upgrade SecWebSocketAccept fwqYZzxhRTDFdWMwlHEA5d52JIMrn rn codepre  pEDIT2 I found a post on SuperUsers with someone who has the same symptoms but a different cause. a hrefhttpsuperuser.comquestions765076websockethandshakeresponsenotforwardedfromtcptoclienthttpsuperuser.comquestions765076websockethandshakeresponsenotforwardedfromtcptoclienta I checked the SHA1 accept value and it checks out.p  pEDIT3 I had a look at the calls using the Chrome developertools. It is kinda weird and it may be because I do not understand completely what is happening. When I have a look at the timeline, I can see the function calls in order. Everytime the line codenew WebSocketthis.urlcode is called, Chrome will, on a successfull connection do the steps [Destroy WebSocket, Send WebSocket Handshake, Receive WebSocket Handsake]. When it stalls on the connecting state, Chrome only shows the step [Destroy WebSocket] and it seems the Send WebSocket Handshake event gets lost. It sounds plausible as that would indeed cause the underlying code to send the handshake request, but never try to read the response. This also seems to show it actually might be a javascript bug.p  pCould someone please show their thoughtsp  pEDIT 5 Here is a picture of the timeline in Google Chrome what I talked about in EDIT 4. Line 38 is the codenew WebSocketthis.urlcode line and the order in which the connections happen is canvas.js, keyboard.js and than mouse.jsnever comes this far. Canvas.js succeeds and keyboard.js stalls in the connecting state. This screenshot is while keyboard.js hangs. a hrefhttpi61.tinypic.com6j3n9d.png relnofollowhttpi61.tinypic.com6j3n9d.pngap

Negative 63161 pIn a server, I am initializing the working directory for a resource on first access to the resource. There may be parallel requests for the resource handled by multiple processes of the server, which means that I need to take care that none of the processes sees a partially initialized working directory. The solution for this is initialize the working directories in a temporary, sibling directory and then move it to its final location with codeFiles.movecode and the codeStandardCopyOption.ATOMICMOVEcode.p  pIn case two processes initialize a working directory at the same time, the second atomic move fails. This is not really a problem because then the working directory is initialized correctly, so the process that came in second only needs to discard the temporary directory it created and continue.p  pI tried to do this with the following codep  precodeprivate void initalizeWorkDirectoryfinal Resource resource throws IOException      File workDir  resource.getWorkDirectory     if workDir.exists          File tempDir  createTemporarySibligDirectoryworkDir         try              fillWorkDirectorytempDir, resource             Files.movetempDir.toPath, workDir.toPath, StandardCopyOption.ATOMICMOVE          catch FileAlreadyExistsException e               do some logging          finally              FileUtils.deleteQuietlytempDir                codepre  pHowever I noticed, that only catching the codeFileAlreadyExistsExceptioncode doesnt seem enough. In case of a move collision, there are also other exceptions thrown. I dont just want to catch all exceptions because this could be hiding real problems.p  pSo isnt there a way to reliably detect from the exception thrown by Files.move that an atomic move of a directory failed because the target directory already existedp

Negative 63161 pI am working on my first emwebem application. I am doing it in Python with Flask, and I want to run a piece of Python code that takes an object, with Pickle, from a binary file of several MB which contains all the necessary data.

However, if I do this, with an Elasticsearch database and in the fastest way I can, the whole process takes about 100 times more time than if I take all the data at once from the binary once the binary is unpickled, which will take at most one second, the computations are very fast, so I am wondering if I should use the binary file, and if so, how to do it in a scalable way. p

Negative 63161 pIm working on a library pugixml that, among other things, provides file loadsave API for XML documents using narrowcharacter C stringsp  precodebool loadfileconst char path bool savefileconst char path codepre  pCurrently the path is passed verbatim to codefopencode, which means that on LinuxOSX you can pass a UTF8 string to open the file or any other byte sequence that is a valid path, but on Windows you have to use Windows ANSI encoding  UTF8 wont work.p  pThe document data is by default represented using UTF8, so if you had an XML document with a file path, you would not be able to pass the path retrieved from the document to codeloadfilecode function as is  or rather, this would not work on Windows. The library provides alternative functions that use codewchartcodep  precodebool loadfileconst wchart path codepre  pBut using them requires extra effort for encoding UTF8 to wchart.p  pA different approach that is used by SQlite and GDAL  not sure if there are other CC libraries that do that involves treating the path as UTF8 on Windows which would be implemented by converting it to UTF16 and using a codewchartcodeaware function like codewfopencode to open the file.p  pThere are different pros and cons that I can see and Im not sure which tradeoff is best.p  pOn one hand, using a consistent encoding on all platforms is definitely good. This would mean that you can use file paths extracted from the XML document to open other XML documents. Also if the application that uses the library adopts UTF8 it does not have to do extra conversions when opening XML files through the library.p  pOn the other hand, this means that behavior of file loading is no longer the same as that of standard functions  so file access through the library is not equivalent to file access through standard codefopencodecodestdfstreamcode. It seems that while some libraries take the UTF8 path, this is largely an unpopular choice is this true, so given an application that uses many thirdparty libraries, it may increase confusion instead of helping developers.p  pFor example, passing codeargv[1]code into codeloadfilecode currently works for paths encoded using system locale encoding on Windows e.g. if you have a Russian locale you can load any files with Russian names like that, but you wont be able to load files with Japanese characters. Switching to UTF8 will mean that only ASCII paths work unless you retrieve the commandline arguments in some other Windowsspecific way.p  pAnd of course this would be a breaking change for some users of the library.p  pAm I missing any important points here Are there other libraries that take the same approach What is better for C  being consistently inconsistent in file access, or striving for uniform crossplatform behaviorp  pNote that the question is about the default way to open the files  of course nothing prevents me from adding emanotherem pair of functions with utf8 suffix or indicating the path encoding in some other way.p

Negative 63161 pIm trying to make a new sort of menu with 4 squares in the middle of the screen, and when you hover over the squares they enlarge, each in a different direction so they dont overlap. I already got the animation part and basic part right, only thing is, how do I get them to move in different directions I already solved this by adding an if statement that gets the id of the element and using that to find out where the square is located. However, this statement failed, I think at the part where it checks the id. I could use some help figuring it out, because I basically tried everything to make it work.

Negative 63161 pThere has been tons of questions on how to properly do data modeling when moving from traditional relational database to nonrelational database such as the App Engine Datastore.p  pI have read the NDB official documentation many times and tried a couple of tutorials on the internet, however, I am still stucked.p  pI am developing a financial application that captures all my personal expenses. This means I have designed an entity called Expense with a few properties on it. As part of an Expense, I also designed a Vendor entity to store information related to merchant. p  pHere is the implementationp  precodeclass Expensendb.Model     amount  ndb.FloatPropertyrequiredFalse     description  ndb.StringProperty     vendor  ndb.KeyPropertykindVendor  class Vendorndb.Model     companyName  ndb.StringPropertyrequiredFalse     friendlyName  ndb.StringPropertyrequiredFalse, default codepre  pThis is the code to retrieve the Expense informationp  precodedef getself     templatepage  expense.html     templatevalues  expenseExpense.query      self.renderTemplatePagetemplatepage, templatevalues codepre  pThe problem I am facing with the design above is how to retreive Expense and Vendor information and pass it to JINJA to render it. As I can expect, the Vendor property in the Expense class is just a Key and not the object itself. So JINJA cannot understand the expression expense.vendor.friendlyNamep  pAlthough the problem seems to be technical, I believe my dificulty is related to the concept of nonrelational database and the traditionallike design I applied to the solution.p  pAn alternative is to use StructuredProperty instead of KeyPrperty. However, one solution requirement is to be able to rename a vendor friendly name and that should affect all exiting expenses. It is insane to go after each stuctured property and find the changes.p  pBefore giving up on App Engine and moving to Google Cloud SQL, I would like to hear some advice on how to solve this data modeling scenario. Maybe the solution I need to build is not recommended for nonrelational database.p  pThansk for any support on that.p

Any ideas as to why I might have to click the pagination bar to activate infinite scrolling and how to fix it I will paste relevant code below, thanks p  precodeltdiv classgridgt     lt stories.each do story gt     ltdiv classcard floatleft griditemgt        ltdiv classcardimagegt         lt if story.image.nil gt           lta href  lt story.url gt gt             ltimg srcassetskwiknewssecondary.pnggt           ltagt         lt else gt           lta href  lt story.url gt gt             ltimg srclt story.image gtgt           ltagt         lt end gt         lth3 classstorytitlegtlt story.name gtlth3gt             ltdivgt       ltpgtlt story.summary gtltpgt       lthr classcardhrgt       ltp classstorydate stylemarginbottom 5pxgtDate published lt formattimestory.publishedat.tos gt ltpgt     ltdivgt      lt end gt  ltdivgt lt end of grid div gt   ltdiv classrow paginationrowgt     ltdiv classcolmd2gtltdivgt     ltdiv idpagenav classcolmd8gt           lt willpaginate stories gt     ltdivgt     ltdiv classcolmd2gtltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pJavascript for masonry and infinite scrollp  precodefunction      var container  .grid      container.imagesLoadedfunction       container.masonry         itemSelector .griditem,         columnWidth 300                   container.infinitescroll       navSelector   pagenav,     selector for the paged navigation        nextSelector  pagenav a,   selector for the NEXT link to page 2       itemSelector  .grid .griditem,      selector for all items youll retrieve       loading            finishedMsg No more pages to load.,           img assetsajaxloader.gif                ,        trigger Masonry as a callback       function newElements            hide new items while they are loading         var newElems   newElements .css opacity 0           ensure that images load before adding to masonry layout         newElems.imagesLoadedfunction            show elems now theyre ready           newElems.animate opacity 1            container.masonry appended, newElems, true                             codepre  pThank you for taking the time to read this post, and I appreciate all feedback and help I can get p

Negative 63161 pThis a followup to [question] a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31751138nogeneratedcodeforexplicitlyspecializedtemplateevenwithexplicitinstantNo generated code for explicitly specialized template even with explicit instantiationa.p  pI am using partial specializations in a .cpp file to handle special cases while not forcing all the code into a header file. A simplified example of what Im doing is given below. This works with both gcc and clang, but given the answer to the question above, Im wondering if Im just getting lucky that the linker is finding compatible symbols.p  pIm starting with a class template defined in foo.hppp  precodepragma once  template lttypename T1, typename T2gt class foo  public   foo T1 t1, T2 t2  dt1t1, dt2t2    foo   default    void print  private   T1 dt1   T2 dt2  codepre  pNote that the print method is declared, but not defined.p  pNow in the foo.cpp, I define the print method.p  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt  template lttypename T1, typename T2gt void fooltT1,T2gtprint      stdcout ltlt T1 is      dt1.print     stdcout ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt T2 is      dt2.print     stdcout ltlt stdendl ltlt stdendl  codepre  pNote that this implementation assumes that both T1 and T2 will have a method called print. In my real world code, the types which are used as arguments to this template usually conform to this interface, but sometimes they dont and I deal with that through partial specialization in the .cpp file. This template is not meant for really generic usage, it only needs to work with a small number of types which I know upfront.p  pSo for instance, I might have 3 types such asp  precodeclass HasPrint  public   HasPrint   default   HasPrint   default    void print     class AlsoHasPrint  public   AlsoHasPrint   default   AlsoHasPrint   default    void print     class NoPrint  public   NoPrint   default   NoPrint   default    void noPrint    codepre  pNote that HasPrint and AlsoHasPrint classes have a print method, while the NoPrint class has a noPrint method. In the bodies of these classes the printnoPrint methods simply print the name of the class.p  pTo handle the case of someone using NoPrint as one of the template arguments, I define a partial specialization in the foo.cpp filep  precodetemplate lttypename T2gt class foo ltNoPrint, T2gt  public   foo NoPrint n1, T2 t2  dn1n1, dt2t2    foo   default    void print         stdcout ltlt NoPrint is      dn1.noPrint     stdcout ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt T2 is      dt2.print     stdcout ltlt stdendl    private   NoPrint dn1   T2 dt2  codepre  pThen to get all the code I need generated for all the permutations that I use, I include in the foo.cpp file the following explicit instantiations of foo.p  precodetemplate class fooltHasPrint, HasPrintgt template class fooltHasPrint, AlsoHasPrintgt template class fooltAlsoHasPrint, AlsoHasPrintgt template class fooltNoPrint, HasPrintgt codepre  pThe result of the last explicit instantiation is that code is generated for an expansion of the template using the NoPrint object and calling the method noPrint.p  pIn a separate test.cpp file, I have the driver for my test program.p  precodeinclude foo.hpp include hasprint.hpp include alsohasprint.hpp include noprint.hpp  int main int argc, char argv    HasPrint h1   HasPrint h2   AlsoHasPrint a1   NoPrint n1   fooltHasPrint, HasPrintgt f1 h1, h2   fooltHasPrint, AlsoHasPrintgt f2 h1, a1   fooltAlsoHasPrint, AlsoHasPrintgt f3 a1, a1   fooltNoPrint, HasPrintgt f4 n1, h1     f1.print   f2.print   f3.print   f4.print  codepre  pThis works as expected on both gcc 4.8.3 and clang 3.2. The result isp  precodeT1 is HasPrint T2 is HasPrint  T1 is HasPrint T2 is AlsoHasPrint  T1 is AlsoHasPrint T2 is AlsoHasPrint  NoPrint is NoPrint T2 is HasPrint codepre  pThis keeps the header for foo.hpp nice and clean at the expense of needing to use explicit instantiation for each set of types for which I use the template, and a partial specialization if one of the argument types does not conform to the interface. p  pGiven that Im using the type Foolt NoPrint, HasPrint  in the test driver, without informing the compiler that a specialization exists, is this wellformed or am I just getting luckyp  pThanksp

Negative 63161 pCurrently I am having an issue really need some help.  We are trying kerberize our hadoop cluster including hive server2 and oozie. My oozie job spins off a java action in data node which tries to connect to kerberized hive server 2.  There is no users kerberos keytab for authentication. So I can only use delegation token passed by oozie in the java action to connect to hive server 2.  My question is is there any way that I can use delegation token in a oozie java action to connect to hive server 2 If so, how can I do it through hive JDBC Thanks Jaryp
Negative 63161 pLately Ive been playing around with Haskell, and specifically the whole functors concept. The more I dive into it, the more aha moments Im getting, and it certainly tickles my dopamine receptors quite a bit.p  pThe problem Im stuck with is the following. Heres the code that works, it lifts the function and then applies it first to the IO value, and then to a List.p  precodereplicator1    fmap replicate 3  replicator2    fmap replicate 3  main  do   replicated lt replicator1 getLine   print replicator2 replicated codepre  pIt is very tempting to write it in a more concise manner, i.e.p  precodereplicator    fmap replicate 3  main  do   replicated lt replicator getLine   print replicator replicated codepre  pPart of me says its conceptually right, since codereplicatorcode should be applyable both to IO and to List instances, but being a strongly typed language Haskell doesnt allow me to do so. I think I pretty much understand why is this happening.p  pThe question is is there any way I can get any closer to the latter variant Or is it fine to live with the formerp  pThank youp

Negative 63161 pIm trying to count the number of instances of a value in a column and return it in another column. I have an expression that works with a hardcoded test value but cannot seem to figure out how to look at the entire column.p  pThere are other things in the main SELECT but I will only include the things Im interested in regarding my question.p  pMy end goal is dividing the Commission column by CommissionRate to get the values in the Commission  Rate column.

Negative 63161 pI may not be able to find the help I need here, but I am hoping the smart coders of the internet can help me. I am attempting to use Pythons SciKit learn SGDClassifier to classify physical events. These physical events create an image of a track black and white and I am trying to get a classifier to classify them. The images are approx 500  400 pixels not quite sure but for machinelearning purposes it gives me a 200640 dimensional vector. I have 20000 train events serialized in data packages of 200 events. Then I have an extra 2000 train events. Here is how I go about extracting and training.p  precodegtgtgt from sklearn.linearmodel import SGDClassifier gtgtgt import dill gtgtgt import glob gtgtgt import numpy as np  gtgtgt clf  SGDClassifierlosshinge  gtgtgtfor file in glob.glob.SerializedDataBatch1.pkl ...    with openfile, rb as stream ...    minibatch  dill.loadstream ...        clf.partialfitminibatch.data, minibatch.target, classesnp.classes[1, 2] Some output stuff about the classifier gtgtgt codepre  pThis is the train part of my code, or at least a rough abbreviation of it. I do have a little bit more complicated initialization of the classifier. Just for more info the codeminibatch.datacode gives a numpy array of shapes and features so that is a 2dimensional numpy array with the shape being 200 and the features being 200640. To clear that up there are arrays describing the pixel values of each image and then 200 of them contained in a big array. codeminibatch.targetcode gives a numpy array of all the class values of each eventp  pHowever, after this training of 20000 events I try to test the classifier and it just does not seem to have been trained at allp  precodegtgtgt file  open.SerializedDataBatch2train1.pkl, rb gtgtgt test  dill.loadfile gtgtgt clf.predicttest.data array[ 2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,     2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,     2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,     2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,     2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,     2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,     2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,     2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,     2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,     2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,     2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,     2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,     2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,     2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,     2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,  2,     2,  2,  2,  2,  2] gtgtgt clf.scoretest.data .484999999999999999999 codepre  pAs you can see the classifier is predicting class 2 for all the test events.
