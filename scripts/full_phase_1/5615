org.restlet.ext.servlet.internal.ServletServerAdapter but the Engines class loader does not see that class by looking at the source of bundle org.restlet.ext.servlet I did not see any place to register class loader or something like that.. strange to mep  pSo to make it work I made a dirty modification  I modified org.restlet.jarMANIFEST.MF and add more import packages org.restlet.ext.servlet.internal and org.restlet.ext.servlet. It works.p  pI appreciate if someone helps to resolve this problem in a clean way.. Thank youp

Positive 5615 pI have Solr 5.2.1 running under Jetty on a Linux Server and the application that connects to Solr is running on another server in the same network at Rackspace. Ive closed port 8983 on the Solr server to block public access to the Solr Admin, but that means the application cannot connect to Solr.p  pIve tried using the private network that runs between the two servers, but have not found any way to connect the application to Solr this way without direct access to port 8983. p  pWhile I know little about Jetty, Ive tried to find a solution there, or reconfiguring localhost, but no success. p  pSorry but I dont have any real examples to provide, as Ive been casting about in the dark for a solution as I know very little about connecting server to server.p  pAny helpful advice would be most appreciated.p

Positive 5615 pI am creating a very simple web app. Basically, I have a list of games I can add games to with a simple HTML form.

Positive 5615 pI wonder if it is possible to start a TLS connection via a SSLSocket and pass the existing connection somehow into my embedded Jetty  does anybody know how I can do thisp  pMy current setup allows to start Jetty and to receive HTTPS requests. Jetty starts the handshake and I have a successful secured TLS connection. However, I received the requirement to handle it slightly different.  Jetty shall be started with an already established TLS connection.p  pThanks in advancep
Positive 5615 h2TLDRh2  pIm trying to find out if an included servlet should be able to change the headers of the response. I knowsup1sup that the included servlet cannot change the headers of the response using the codeHttpServletResponsecode object passed in its codeservicecode. But it is inconsistent how different servlet containers behave if trying to change headers using the emoriginalem response.p  h2Backgroundh2  pTo me, this is relevant because Im debugging an issue in a system using a a hrefhttpsgithub.comalkaconopencmscoretreebuild952 relnofollow titleOpenCms 9.5.2CMSa that apparently does exactly that its core servlet stores the original response in the request scope for some complex caching and templating purposes, and in the included resource jsp it restores the original response and tries to set the header content type to fit its needs.p  pNotice that at the time of setting the codecontentTypecode, the response has not yet been commitedsup2sup in fact, no writing activity has taken place.p  pAlso notice that I could also workaround this issue setting some a hrefhttpsgithub.comalkaconopencmscoreissues341 relnofollow titleOpenCms core document stream and bypassundocumented propertya, but in this case, I would be giving up its caching functionality.p  pThe problem arises if I add a certain Filter to the servlet filter chain Tomcat uses reflection to calculate where it has to insert a codeServletResponseWrappercode specifically, an codeApplicationHttpResponsecode in the possibly chained implicit response object. For instance, a hrefhttpsgithub.comjavamelodyjavamelodyissues494 relnofollow titleJavaMelody breaks compatibility in servlets under Tomcat that exercise response.setadd methodsJavaMelodya a monitoring filter happens to wrap the original response in one of the objects against which Tomcat compares to, breaking the dubiouslycorrect implemented existing functionality. p  h2Testsh2  pTo find a practical answer and set some basis for potential new issues, I have written a hrefhttpsgithub.comgallardoSOtreeSO32561665 relnofollow titlegithub.comgallardoSO test reposome testsa and run them under WildFly Full 9.0.1.Final, Apache Tomcat6.0.29, Apache Tomcat7.0.47, and Jetty9.3.3.v20150827.

Positive 5615 pUsing the default REST implementation Jersey codecom.sun.jersey.spi.spring.container.servlet.SpringServletcode along with Spring running inside Jetty, a data source problem emerged.p  pA custom data source manager based on Hikari is used and the JdbcTemplate is fetched directly from the manager bypassing Jetty and Jersey.

Negative 5615 pI write many scripts at home and on the job.  Most of the time the scripts get used only a few times to accomplish their chosen task and then are never used again.  However, sometimes I write a script to do something more complicated, something that requires user input.  It is at this point that I usually agonize over whether to implement a GUI or stick with a yn, press 110, etc. commandline interface.  This type of interface can become tedious to use and difficult to maintain.p  pI know some things lend themselves to a GUI more than others, such as selecting things in a giant list.  However, the time it takes to switch a commandline application to use a GUI is prohibitive.

Or am I going about this the wrong way, should I always be writing my scripts assuming I might later add a GUIp

Negative 5615 pI am looking for guidance on how to best think about designing a highlevel application protocol to sync metadata between enduser devices and a server.p  pMy goal the user can interact with the application data on any device, or on the web. The purpose of this protocol is to communicate changes made on one endpoint to other endpoints through the server, and ensure all devices maintain a consistent picture of the application data. If user makes changes on one device or on the web, the protocol will push data to the central repository, from where other devices can pull it.p  pSome other design thoughtsp  ul liI call it metadata syncing because the payloads will be quite small, in the form of object IDs and small metadata about those IDs. When client endpoints retrieve new metadata over this protocol, they will fetch actual object data from an external source based on this metadata. Fetching the real object data is out of scope, Im only talking about metadata syncing here.li liUsing HTTP for transport and JSON for payload container. The question is basically about how to best design the JSON payload schema.li liI want this to be easy to implement and maintain on the web and across desktop and mobile devices. The best approach feels to be simple timer or eventbased HTTP requestresponse without any persistent channels. Also, you should not have a PhD to read it, and I want my spec to fit on 2 pages, not 200.li liAuthentication and security are out of scope for this question assume that the requests are secure and authenticated.li liThe goal is eventual consistency of data on devices, it is not entirely realtime. For example, user can make changes on one device while being offline. When going online again, user would perform sync operation to push local changes and retrieve remote changes.li liHaving said that, the protocol should support both of these modes of operation ul liStarting from scratch on a device, should be able to pull the whole metadata pictureli lisync as you go. When looking at the data on two devices side by side and making changes, should be easy to push those changes as short individual messages which the other device can receive nearrealtime subject to when it decides to contact server for sync.li ulli ul  pAs a concrete example, you can think of Dropbox it is not what Im working on, but it helps to understand the model on a range of devices, the user can manage a files and foldersmove them around, create new ones, remove old ones etc. And in my context the metadata would be the file and folder structure, but not the actual file contents. And metadata fields would be something like filefolder name and time of modification all devices should see the same time of modification.p  pAnother example is IMAP. I have not read the protocol, but my goals minus actual message bodies are the same.p  pFeels like there are two grand approaches how this is donep  ul litransactional messages. Each change in the system is expressed as delta and endpoints communicate with those deltas. Example DVCS changesets.li liREST communicating the object graph as a whole or in part, without worrying so much about the individual atomic changes.li ul  pstrongEDITstrong some of the answers rightly say that there is not enough info about the app to offer good enough suggestions. The exact nature of the app might be distracting, but a very basic RSS reading app is a good enough approximation. So lets say the app spec is the followingp  ul liThere are two classes feeds and items.li liI can add, rename and delete feeds. Adding a feed subscribes to it and starts receiving items for that feed. I can also reorder the feed display order in the UI.li liAs I read items, they are marked as read. I cannot mark them unread or do anything else with them.li liBased on the above, the object model is ul lifeed has attributes url, displayName and displayOrder displayOrder is index of feed in UIs list of feeds reordering feeds locally changes the displayOrder of all feeds so that the indexes remain unique and sequential.li liitem has attributes url and unread, and manytoone relation feed each item belongs in one feed. url also behaves as GUID for the item.li liactual item contents are downloaded locally on each device and are not part of sync.li ulli ul  pBased on this design, I can set up my app on one device add a bunch of feeds, rename and reorder them, and read some items on them, which are then marked as unread. When I switch devices, the other device can sync the configuration and show me the same feed list with same names, order and same item readunread states.p  pend editp  pWhat I would like in the answersp  ul liIs there anything important I left out above Constraints, goalsli liWhat is some good background reading on this I realize this is what many computer science courses talk about at great length and detail... I am hoping to shortcircuit it by looking at some crash course or nuggets.li liWhat are some good examples of such protocols that I could model after, or even use out of box I mention Dropbox and IMAP above... I should probably read the IMAP RFC.li ul
Negative 5615 pIm using threads and xmlrpclib in python at the same time. Periodically, I create a bunch of thread to complete a service on a remote server via xmlrpclib.

Over time, number of threads in this state increases and will reach the maximum number of allowed threads on the system Im using fedora.

Negative 5615 pThank you for taking the time to read this and I will appreciate every single response no mater the quality of content. p  pIm trying to create a php script which retries another php script up to 3 times until an error message is displayed. Im thinking perhaps this could be done using a php loop If the code works successfully the first time, then there is no need for it to retry 3 times, however, if it doesnt work the first time, then it should retry the php script up to 3 times untill an error message is displayed.p  pUsing php coding, Ive managed to make a script which grabsfetches content from another location using filegetcontents and thereafter gives each worddata a php variable. All this was done by getting help from other members on stackoverflow which I extremely appreciate. The code below is what does it allp  precodesearchdata  filegetcontentshttpwww.example.com  listno1, no2, no3, no4, no5,       no6, no7, no8, no9  explode , searchdata codepre  pSo, Id like to add some sort of loop which retries this script up to 3 times if it doesnt work the first time.p  pTo determine whether the script works the firstsecondthird time or not, the text endofscript or failure should be found when using filegetcontents. The text endofscript should be on the variable no9 and the text failure should be on the variable no2. If anything else is found other than endofscript or failure that should be counted as an error and should be looped till found. If it still isnt found after the third try, could an error message be displayed Such as Error  Please try again.p  pThank you for all your assistance and I will appreciate each and every single reply. If you need more details, please feel free to ask.  And again, Im really grateful for this. p

Negative 5615 pIm attempting to determine the tile that the mouse is currently hovering over in an OpenLayers map. The code that currently is written  that uses a standard Hover handler and simply sends back the event  works in Chrome but fails in Firefox, because an SVG element comes in between the tile and the mouse. Im sure that something similar could happen in IE with VML.p  pSo, the question is, how does one determine the element that a mouse is over if that element is blocked by another element that is currently the target of that request Or, is it possible to rerun an event using trigger in another div, and retrieve the new target to simulate the same Otherwise, its difficult and inefficient to determine the image that lies at a certain pixel coordinate using OpenLayers.p

Negative 5615 pI looked around, and the latest reference I saw was from 2008 stating that the standard codeFileReferencecode browser does not support retrieving the users files absolute local path unless its an AIR app, and indeed theres nothing in the docs suggesting otherwise. The reasoning behind this is apparently some misguided security concern... I get its not a great idea to let any Flash app know your directory structure, but if the user actually grants your app a file, I think it doesnt invalidate the security model to know just that files absolute path.p  pIm wondering if the state of things has changed at all with Flex 4 and theres a method of getting the local filename of anything. I need it because Im making an application that when distributed runs locally in 99 of cases, so doing a full file upload just to save it somewhere else on the local machine seems silly. Plus the standard file uploading method doesnt support SOAP, which is what Im using for all my other services... I can always just have the user type in their local path name, but that seems really stupid.p

Negative 5615 pIm part of a small team that want to move to using TFS for source control and build management for a SQL Server 2008 database. For our product, it is possible to have customers that are running different versions of the productdatabase. One issue I need to resolve is how to manage complex upgradescripts for situations beyond the normal capabilities of deployment.p  pA simple example of this  p  pVersion 1.0 has separate tables for Admins and Clients.  p  pVersion 2.0 replaces these tables with one Users table. For this, a custom script is needed to migrate information from Admins and Clients to Users. According to the guide from Visual Studio ALM Rangers httpvsdatabaseguide.codeplex.com, the best way to do this would be to copy the data into a temporary database in predeployment and then copy out of the temporary database in postdeployment.p  pThis method would work fine for deploying Version 2.0 to an existing Version 1.0 database, but how do you manage this update script for future versions One of the goals of using TFS here is to be able to deploy Version 3.0 to databases that are running either Version 1.0 or Version 2.0 the upgradescript would have to remain as part of the deployment process so that going from 1.0 to 3.0, but the script should not be included when going from 2.0 to 3.0. p  pCan upgradescripts like this be managed through TFS Does TFS have the capability to only execute certain scripts based of any kind of versioningp

Negative 5615 pI have another Javascript regex conundrum... apologies if this is a bit longwinded  hard to explainp  pI have a script which sends a string to a popup window all characters are encoded when they are sent, so all backslashes are preserved. In the popup it has several text input boxes, and also a summary span which displays what is in all the input boxes, and is updated whenever a keyup is detected. Then when the user is finished, they click a button which sends the updated summary string back to the opener.p  pThe requirement is that backslashes are prepended automatically to the following characters code  code, so the user doesnt need to do this themselves. Currently I have code that strips out any backslashes in the input boxes, but the summary adds them where appropriate.p  pEg. if this string is sent to the popup codefoobarbatzhicode Then it will look like this in the summary codefoobarbatzhicode and like this in the input box codefoobarbatzhicode. If you then edit the string like this in the input box codefoobarbatzhiyacode, then it looks like this in the summary codefoobarbatzhiyacode. So far so good... but if you attempt to type this in the input box codefoobarbatzhiyacode, then it looks like this in the summary codefoobarbatzhiyacode. It should look like this codefoobarbatzhiyacodep  pThis is down to the existing code that is run on every kepup. It basically needs a regex to look at the string, and add backslashes to code  or code if they do not exist already. This requires a negative lookbehind to check for preexisting backslashes but javascript cannot do negative lookbehinds. I thought I had cracked this by reversing the string first using a custom function, and doing a negative lookahead, then reversing the string again, like thisp  precodevar thisBoxVal  this.val thisBoxVal  reverseStrthisBoxVal thisBoxVal  thisBoxVal.replaceg,1 thisBoxVal  reverseStrthisBoxVal codepre  pHowever, I can now see where the problem lies. When encountering the first or 2nd because it is reversed of a double backslash, it adds the extra backslash. But because the 2nd backslash has this first backslash there already, it wont add it.p  pI also have concerns about memory allocation every time a string is reversed. This is because I learned that javascript strings are immutable, which I believe has the unfortunate effect of allocating more memory every time a string is reversed. Doing this on every keystroke as it needs to do this to update the summary line whenever the input box is altered may cause some issues....p  pIs there any other way of doing this Preferably with just some regex, and no reversing...p  pSo to summarise, the requirement is to create a regex replace that searches a string for any of these chars code  code and add an escaping backslash before them if an escaping backslash doesnt exist already. So it should have the intelligence when encountering more than one backslash in a row, to escape each one note that Im not updating the actual input box, but a variable which I use to update the summary.p  pI need a regex masters helpp

Negative 5615 pHey guys, I am attempting to mimic the partial page curl animation that can be found in the Map app that comes on the iPhone. I am able to get it to partially curl, but the toolbar curls with the curling page, which I dont want. I merely want the toolbar at the bottom of the screen to stay where it is while the map view itself curls up.p  pI have a map view display in a navigation controller view. To me, it makes most sense if I load up this view from the root view controller, and I am able to successfully, however, the animation does not work as anticipated. Instead of having the page curl animation occur, the sliding of the view from the right occurs and the animation I have set takes place emwithin buttonsem inside of the view. It is really very strange... I have even tried nonmodal transition styles and get the same exact effect. Here is the relevant codep  precodeIBActiondisplayInfoButtonTapped      NSLogParkingRootViewController displayInfoButtonTapped      MapInfoView mapInfoView  [[MapInfoView alloc] initWithNibNameMapInfoView bundlenil]       [UIView beginAnimationsnil contextNULL]     [UIView setAnimationDuration1]     [UIView setAnimationTransitionUIViewAnimationTransitionCurlUp forViewmapInfoView.view cacheYES]     [UIView commitAnimations]        [self.navigationController pushViewControllermapInfoView animatedYES]     [mapInfoView release]      [mapView displayInfoButtonTapped]   codepre  pAnyone have any idea of what I am doing wrong Or does anyone have a better method of how to go about doing what I am trying to do Thanksp

Negative 5615 pSince Riak uses buckets as a way of separating keys, is it possible to have buckets within buckets If not how would one go about organizing a Riak setup with many buckets for several apps.p  pThe basic problem is how one would go about representing databases and tables within Riak. Since a bucket translates to a table, what translates to a databasep  pNamespaces in programming languages usually have hierarchies. It makes sense for Riak buckets to also allow hierarchies, since buckets are essentially namespaces.p

Negative 5615 pSo I have an HTML page that I want to take apart and put into my website in a more developer friendly manner. I was using Iframes but now I decided to integrate it into my .tpl file. For the life of me I cant figure out how to include a custom js file in the .tpl The way other files are included is in a php file but this is just to include the config file. I managed to put the HTML in the .tpl fine, the last part I need is the javascript. I believe the issue is that the JS is uses Jquery so I need to include that library but I cant seem to make it work. Any ideas Ive used literal and that didnt work either....p  pI can provide code examples on reqeustp

The activation key will not be bound to the machine since I have no idea where exactly a role will be run in the cloud so anyone can use it to make a copy of that library work.p  pSince Azure roles run somewhere not under our control I feel somewhat paranoid about the key being stolen and made widely available.p  pHow do I evaluate how likely it is to steal a binary file that is included into Azure role How do I mitigate such risksp

Negative 5615 pIm using InfoPath 2010 to customize a SharePoint 2010 list form. The Infopath form shows data from two SharePoint lists, a Parent list and Child list.

Negative 5615 pI am using cakephp with postgresql. Some of my tables are very large.When using cakephps pagination, it runs codeCOUNTcode on the large table and then it queries for the actual result. The count query takes 2.5 minutes, while the actual query that returns the data takes 95ms. p  pIs it possible to remove the need for the count, or replace it with something that may go faster I dont need an exact number of rows returned, much like the way a Google search returns results 110 of about 765,000.p  pEDIT Alternately, is there a way I can disable count altogether There will often be so many results knowing how many pages is not necessary. All I need is a Next button that increases the SQL OFFSET like the cakephp pagination already has, and if no rows are returned on the next page then that is fine.p

Negative 5615 pWe recently moved to jQuery 1.6 and ran into the attr versus prop backcompat issue. During the first few hours after the change was deployed everything was fine, then it started breaking for people. We identified the problem pretty quickly and updated the offending JS, which was inline.p  pNo we have a situation where some folks are still having issues. In every case thus far, I could get the user up and running again by telling them to load the page in question then manually refresh it in the browser. So something must still be cached somewhere.p  pBut there are basically only two potential culprits First, the jQuery library itself, but this is loaded with the version number in the query string so I think browsers will be refreshing it in their cache. Second, the inline javascript. Is it possible that this is being cached in the browserp  pWe are using APC, apc.stat1 so it should be detecting that the PHP files have changed. Just to be on the safe side I nuked the opcode cache anyway.p  pTo summarize, I have two questionsp  ol liCould some browsers be ignoring the query string when jQuery is loadedli liCould some browsers be caching an older version of the inline javascriptli ol  pAny other ideas very welcome too.p  pUPDATE In the course of checking that there wasnt any unexpected caching going on using Firebug, I discovered a case where the old jQuery library would load. That doesnt explain why we had trouble after deploying the site and before we updated the inline code, but if it solves the problem Ill take it.p

Negative 5615 pI followed a hrefhttpwww.belafontecode.comhowtohostmultiplesubdomainsonmodxrevolution relnofollowthis tutoriala to manage subdomains for a MODx Revo 2.1.3 installation. The idea is that the htaccess file in the web root folder redirects calls for subdomain.mydomain.com to a folder in the web root directory by the same name as the subdomain, ie homemydomainwwwsubdomain. Subdomain contains the MODx files to run the page, as well as another htaccess to point all further requests back to the root folder.p  pThe better part of it works I can view the homepage of the site which means MODx is doing its part, but none of the links to the css, js, images, etc work, and it seems like the Wayfinder and getResources packages are failing to output. The links that are being used for the imagescssjs are subdomainassets...etc I need the links to point directly to the assets folder.

Negative 5615 pSo, some background Im using a memory scanner called a hrefhttpwww.cheatengine.org relnofollowcheat enginea to get realtime values for game stats e.g. hp, mana, exp in a non opensource video game that Im trying to make a bot for.p  pFor my bot to effectively use this information, I need to get it from cheat engine or any memory scanner with similar functionality to my bot code in a timely manner.p  pNow, one obvious way to do that would be to save all of the information to a file and then load the file in my bot code, but since this data needs updating about every half second or so, that isnt a real solution.p  pWhat I really need is either a terribly convenient memory scanner that allows you to use the information you uncover as a set of variables in some programming language preferably java, c, or matlab, or a way to access the memory addresses found in one of the above languages.p  pThis latter option should hopefully be doable, as cheat engine gives the memory address, controlling process ID, and data type.p

Negative 5615 piThe producer module of my application is run by users who want to submit work to be done on a small cluster. It sends the subscriptions in JSON form through the RabbitMQ message broker.ip  pI have tried several strategies, and the best so far is the following, which is still not fully workingp  pEach cluster machine runs a consumer module, which subscribes itself to the AMQP queue and issues a strongprefetchcountstrong to tell the broker how many tasks it can run at once.p  pI was able to make it work using SelectConnection from the Pika AMQP library. Both consumer and producer start two channels, one connected to each queue. The producer sends requests on channel [A] and waits for responses in channel [B], and the consumer waits for requests on channel [A] and send responses on channel [B]. It seems, however, that when the consumer runs the callback that calculates the response, it blocks, so I have only one task executed at each consumer at each time.p  pWhat I need in the endp  ol li the consumer [A] subscribes his tasks around 5k each time to the clusterli li the broker dispatches N messagesrequests for each consumer, where N is the number of concurrent tasks it can handle li li when a single task is finished, the consumer replies to the brokerproducer with the resultli li the producer receives the replies, update the computation status and, in the end, prints some reports li ol  pstrongRestrictionsstrongp  ul liIf another user submits work, all of his tasks will be queued after the previous user I guess this is automatically true from the queue system, but I havent thought about the implications on a threaded environmentli liTasks have an order to be submitted, but the order they are replied is not importantli ul  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI have studied a bit further and my actual problem seems to be that I use a simple function as callback to the pikas SelectConnection.channel.basicconsume function. My last unimplemented idea is to pass a threading function, instead of a regular one, so the callback would not block and the consumer can keep listening.p

Negative 5615 pThe problem I am facing is following. I have a number of 3D head scans, some of them are taken correctly like attached example but in many it is easy to see that the scanned person had his head not exactly aligned with the machines front and thus one side of the texture and depth map seems to be wider the exact reason is that one side was taken more from behind, it can be easily seen if you look at the ears.p  pFortunately when I go from the cylindrical coordinates to carthesian ones and render the face with XNA, the face is symmetrical.p  pNow the thing is that I would like the texture and depth maps of all my heads by as nice and symmetrical as the correct one because later i want to align them and perform PCA.p  pThe idea I have at the moment is that I could interpolate the surfaces between all of the vertices and from those interpolations take new vertices that are equally distanced from each other. This solutions seems a lot of work and maybe its an overkill.  Maybe there is some other way like geting that interpolation data from DirectXXNA that has to calculate it at some point anyway.p  pI will be most thankful for helpful answers.p  pThe correct example a hrefhttpi55.tinypic.com332mio2.jpg relnofollowhttpi55.tinypic.com332mio2.jpga Incorrect example a hrefhttpi54.tinypic.com309ujvt.jpg relnofollowhttpi54.tinypic.com309ujvt.jpgap

Negative 5615 pIm the developer of an inhouse program for modeling harmonics and other properties of liquidfilled shells. Right now, the whole program assumes that theres only one set of physical properties temperature, pressure, etc. being used at a time in calculations. I have already broken all of the calculations out into a Sphere model. I have a controller which owns a sphere. When the user changes the physical properties the controller has the sphere recalculate everything and updates all the windows which are displaying the results of sphere calculations.p  pNow someone has asked me to make a table displaying the frequencies of a specific harmonic over a range of temperatures and pressures. I think this is going to require a new controller that has its own sphere model because it needs to be independent of all the other windows.p  pHeres my question Should my new controller be an NSWindowController subclass or should it be an NSObject subclass with a property that is an NSWindow whose text fields are bound to values in the controller or something completely different Im the only developer in the company and I learned Cocoa on my own as I wrote this program over the past four years so Im not sure Ive always followed best practices. Since Im about to introduce a new significant functionality Id like to make sure Im doing it right.p  pNot sure this matters, but the solution has to run under OS X 10.5 because we still have some G5 machines in the organization.p

Is there some way that I can set up this script so that the emails are not marked as spamp  pIve done quite a lot of reading and from what Ive read today it seems like a few factors can influence whether mail is marked as spam including the words used in the emails the domain that the emails say they are sent from compared to where they actually originate formatting of headers and the frequency of emails sent.p  pThe email addresses that we use are with Gmail Apps. So, if the emails I send dont look spammy, I send them from Gmail, and I can limit the frequency of the emails sent maybe 10 every 10 minutes then I should be able to do this without a problem rightp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pThis is not for a newsletter. Do I even have to worry about being marked as spam for invitation emailsp

But the storage only lasts as long as the apps life time.  p  pIf I restart  my app then the image will be load from the web again.p  pI setup my WebView as following p  precode        mWebSettings.setAppCacheEnabledtrue     mWebSettings.setDomStorageEnabledtrue     mWebSettings.setDatabaseEnabledtrue     mWebSettings.setDatabasePathfiledatadatacom.xxxdatabases codepre  pbut I can see the files in  codefiledatadatacom.xxxdatabasescode keep unchanged when Im adding something into localStorage. p  pSo, my question is how to make my webpages store data and keep them after the app is closed   p  pAnd is it matters if I use multiple WebView in a app and pointing the codeDatabasePathcode the the same folderp  pAnd if you can tell me the different between codeDomStoragecode, codeDatabasecode, codeAppCachecode is  so much the betterp

Negative 5615 pIm thinking in learning Zend or Symfony frameworks but I dont know which one to choose or if I really need them at all.p  pI usually develop small to medium web apps management apps, I have my own classes to quickly develop database connections and data grids, maybe could improve in form development as I still build them quite hand made. So far, I dont find a problem to program spaghetti code in small projects, maybe in medium ones its time to think in MVC.p  pSo, I wonder where to invest my effortsp  ol liImprove my own classes that fit my limited needsli liLearn Symfony 2li liLearn Zendli ol  pMy main concern is if I really need a framework or not and I know that there are many questions and opinions about emsymfony vs zendem, I read them and the conclusion is emits up to you, they are both goodem, I know that, but Id like to hear your opinions having this in countp  pMy goal is to find a way to develop faster, as for MVC standard I know they are similar. Also, which one is better if you want to develop for desktop and mobile devices are there any built in utilities for this How about forms Which ones are more programmer friendlyp  pI also develop in ASP.NET and one thing I dont like of .NET is the difficult integration of client and server, I mean, if you choose to program with server controls, JavaScript does not integrate well and you better manage events in server, so a better clientserver integration is also welcome.p  pYour opinions are welcome.p  pThank youp

Negative 5615 pIm new to web applications and am trying to understand the best way to work with data in HTML. Im using Appengine Python and have managed to load a bunch of data to the view. In the simplest form, its a set of movie names and each name has associated details with it e.g. year, rating etc. Now how do I pass data between the movie link and then a div where all the details will be displayed Ill be using jQuery for some controls in my application so Im wondering if theres a way to do data binding to controls with thatp  pAdditionally, can anyone tell me whatre the standards around this i.e. if I load all this data to the UI in one call assuming its not a lot of movie titles, wouldnt it make it easy for people to screen scrape this information Or is there some obfuscation thats typically used herep  pSorry if Im not very clear but I really am an absolute beginner with web developmentp  pUpdate1 I found the jQuery data api. It seems like thisll work. Commentsp  pUpdate2 Some testing later and it turns out that data actually attaches the data to the elements rather than showing it in a div itself.p

Negative 5615 pI already know that, when I put the definition of a member function into a header and mark the function as codeinlinecode, the code in the function gets inlined into any place where the function is called out of a .cpp file, so when it comes to a compiled binary, I know where the functions code is located  within the compiled code of any .cpp file that depends on it. But what happens if I dont mark a function in a header with codeinlinecode and the functions body is large enough to make the compiler choose not to inline it In the context of a staticdynamic library the functions class belongs to, where does the functions code is compiled to Or is it not compiled at all and the final destination for the functions code is a compiled .cpp of a client of the library If its the latter case, does the functions code still gets inlined even if I didnt mark it with codeinlinecode because its code was too heavy And finally, is MSVC compilers behavior in this case differs from the GCCs onep  pAnd sure, I realize that putting member functions I want to be inlined into .h file or .inl file and heavy function into .cpp file would make things crystal clear, but I would really like to avoid breaking a class implementation across files, hence is the interest.p

Negative 5615 pIs there a way to prevent CMake from creating a symlink for shared libraries like codelibfoo.socode when you are using soversioning which means you would have something like codelibfoo.so.0.8codep  pThe reason why I am asking this is that I have a project where I would like to make multiple versions of that project installable in parallel. Most package managers however reject a parallel installation if a file like the symlink is present in multiple packages.p  pAs a background info we are using CPack to build the packages and ultimately I think it is a flaw of CPack that you cannot prevent this symlink or at least being able to separate dev and runtime packages e.g. for debian. However, so far I have the illusions that just preventing CMake from creating the symlink at all might be the easier thing to do than patching CPack.p

Negative 5615 pI apologize if this question is not specific enough, but I do need some help understanding this concept. Ive been researching many Javascript libraries including JQuery, MooTools, Backbone, Underscore, Handlebars, Mustache, etc  also Node.js and Meteor I know all those serve different purposes. I have a basic idea of what each does, but my question is mainly focused on the templating libraries.  p  pI think the general idea is that the template will be filled by a JSON object thats retrieved from the server. However, im confused by how that JSON object is formed, and if it can go the other way to the backend to update the database. Please correct me if this is incorrect.p  pFor a more solid example, lets say I have Apache running on Linux, and am using MongoDB as the database and python as my primary language. How do all these components interact with the templating library and each other  p  pFor example, if I have an HTML file with a form in it and the action will be set to some python script will that script have to retrieve the fields, validate them, and then update them in the DB If its MySQL Id have to write a SQL statement to update it, but with Mongo wouldnt it be differenteasier since its BSONJSON based  p  pAnd for the other example, lets say I have a viewaccount.html page that will need to pull up user information from the DB, in what form will it pull the information out and how will it fill it into the template Im guessing id have to have a python script that pulls the information from the DB, create a JSON object, and use it to populate the fields in the html template.p  pI am aware there are web frameworks that will ease this process, and please suggest any that you would recommend however, Im really interested in understanding the concepts of how these components interact.p  pThanksp
Negative 5615 pI have a C function that I ported to Matlabp  pHowever the C version produces much better output than my Matlab version so I want the Matlab version to produce the required data codes, load then in to a variable in C, and let C do the processing on the data points and vice versa, so that I can compare where and how the two programs work differently on the same set of data The problem is one data set is at least 256 floats long and there are hundreds of such data setsp  pIt would be more convenient if I could calculate the data set in Matlab, store them in a file and send an Acknowledge signal to the C debugger, so that when it gets the signal from Matlab it continues to single step through its code, loading the data provided my matlab from the file on diskp  pWould it even be possible to do this If possible I want to be able to do this in reverse as well, that is, the C program produces the data points and stores then in a file, then signals Matlab to continue to single step through its codep  pEDITp  pI feel that although the VC 2010 debugger is very easy to use, they have made it very difficult to be used in conjunction with any other programs. So if doing this in gccs debugger using Codeblocks, or anything else is possible, I would like some suggestions on how to do this that is does not have to be VCs debuggerp
Negative 5615 pI just discovered some strange behaviour on iPad with the new iOS 6. Im testing a web app for offline usage. The web app is no more than a static website with a cache manifest, so no special frameworks like sencha touch or tools like phnoegap are used. Just HTML, CSS and JavaScript and a cache.manifest. p  pThe App worked fine before I could save the website to the home screen. When I opened it from there, all the data would be downloaded for caching. At the end of the download the popup would come to ask if I wanted to increase the cache to 50MB  accepted  everything was fine  offline usage worked.p  pNow after the update to iOS 6 I made some changes to the app. Deinstalled the app from homescreen. Opened it again in mobile safari. Saved to home screen. When opened the download starts as supposed to. But then it freezes at 99. When I look it up in the console, I get the errormessage Application Cache update failed, because size quota was exceeded.p  pAnd here comes the weird thing When I open it in the browser, download starts and at the end I get asked if I want to increase cache size to 50MB. I confirm of course. When I now look in the preferences of safari at website data, I see that all the cached data for this app is about 33MB So not at all more than 50MB p  pIs this a bug of iOS6 Did anyone experience any problems with caching data, when saving a website to the homescreen since the update to iOS 6 Thx for any help, as I am really stuck here... Couldnt find anything helpfull on the web...p  pUnfortunately I cannot post any link to the web app andor its files.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI found some more information on this issuep  pa hrefhttpwww.nsbasic.comblogp928 relnofollowhttpwww.nsbasic.comblogp928a p  pApparently wepapps saved to the home screen are treated now like native apps, meaning each instance of the same webapp saved to the home screen gets its own storage sandbox. So the data is independet from the data saved in mobile Safari. This means if you delete all of mobile safaris websitedata this has no effect on the web app saved to the home screen before ios6 they shared the same data. p  pI also found this p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq125038151254555iOS 6 breaks GeoLocation in webapps applemobilewebappcapablea p  pThough not exactly the same topic, it could be related. Apparently web apps saved to the home screen using p  precodeltmeta contentyes nameapplemobilewebappcapable gt codepre  pwontt be able to use geolocation. Geolocation only works when you remove this meta tag from your web app. Maybe this is also a workaround for the caching problem, I couldnt test it yet. But then again Maybe the cache.manifest is no longer needed if the web apps saved to home screen are treated more like native apps I will report back here if I find out more.p  pstrongEDIT2strong p  pOk after some testing and no useful hints from neither the web nor apple, I found out at least something When I remove p  precodeltmeta contentyes nameapplemobilewebappcapable gt codepre  pfrom the site everything of course works fine, because its just like you open Safari and there I had no problem so far. So my interest is to make it work without the browser chrome. As described above the caching only goes to 99 and then I get the cache size quota exceeding error. Then I just closed the home screen app and opened it again. Now the caching downloads start again and complete just fine No freezing, no error And everything seems to be stored localy. I could only test it on the iPad simulator today but I hope I can confirm this as soon as I can get my hands on our device later.p  pSo it seems like instead of being asked if you want to increase the cache size you get the cache size quota exceeding error. Maybe because data storage for home screen apps now is handled differently you dont have to manualy increase the cache size anymore which of course is pure speculation. Still, if this was the case, there should not be any error. So instead of being asked to increase cache size you have to open the home screen app twice, which is a pretty lame workaround btw...p  pstrongEDIT3strong p  pI just could confirm this behaviour on a real device saved to home screen  opened from home screen  download to be cached files  cache size quota exceeding error at the end  close home screen app press home button  reopen it again  to be cached files download again  this time without error  everthing usable offline. p  pI also tested it on a device with iOS 5 and there it works like expected without errors. So this is definitely an iOS 6 issue.p  pCan anyone else confirm this behaviour or bugp  pstrongEDIT4strongp  pI occasionally had the chance to test this on iOS 6.1.3  unfortunately still the same behaviour...p

Negative 5615 pRecently, I just wrote an eclipse plugin to auto deploy one specific Java EE application to my tomcat server. During the process, there was a step which needed to decompress RPM file downloaded from build server. When I searched the solution from Google, nothing found. I just know that there  exists a commons compress lib to decompress various archived files, such as gzipcpioartar etc. But for RPM file, it doesnt work. Can anyone else know how to decompress RPM file using Java Thanks in advance.p

Negative 5615 pI have an app which is published on both Google Play and Amazon AppStore.  I recently added map API features to this app, so I had to use the Google APIs SDK to build it.  I have successfully published my new version on Google Play, but having problems on Amazon.p  pThe app was rejected by Amazon AppStore because they said the Kindle line of devices would not support it.  After further research I downloaded the new Kindle emulators and found that they do not support the Google APIs.  Since Kindle Fire tablets seem to be the primary devices for people purchasing apps through Amazon AppStore, I realized that I need to submit a version of my app which does not include the map features, but otherwise is the same app.p  pSo my question is  how do I create a second version of the App which is based on the standard Android SDK and does not include the mapping API, but uses the same Java source files  As a longtime C programmer I could easily do this in C using conditional compile flags, but Ive come to realize that Java does not support conditional compilation.  And I certainly dont know how to exclude libraries from one Android Eclipse build and include them in another build.p  pCan anyone give me some tips on how to achieve my desired result in Android  I know I could create two separate apps but there would be a lot of code overlap which would be a lot more work for me when I have to do updates, I really dont want to have to maintain two separate codebases just to support Kindle Firesp

Negative 5615 pThe objective of PHP traits is to manage a bunch of logic. However what is the best way to make this bunch of logic works according some dedicated attributes and avoiding naming conflicts p  pIm thinking about MVC and particularly the model class. Indeed models seems to be good candidates for traits. Models can implement tree structure, be draftable, revisionnable, sluggable, and so on.p  pI would like to write something like thisp  precodeclass MyModel extends Model      use Tree, Revision, Slug     protected behaviors  array         Tree gt arrayparentFieldname gt pid,         Revision gt array some options ,         Slug gt array some options           public function construct          foreachthisgtbehaviors as ampoptions              options   trait defaults                  codepre  pIf I intend to set the Tree trait like this p  precodetrait Tree      protected defaults  array         parentFieldname gt parentid,         ...other options...          public function moveUp     public function moveDown     public function setParent lt need the parentFieldname gt pidattribute     ...and so on...  codepre  pIll reach into naming conflicts because of codedefaultscode since each trait needs its own defaults. Using the name of the trait as attribute name imply using something like codenew ReflectionClassCLASSgtgetTraitscode... which is not really awesome.p  pIn other words is there a way to create traits with overridable defaults and avoid naming conflicts p

Negative 5615 pI would like to be able to convert a highvalued unsignedinteger a value that uses the highestorder bit to a signedinteger.  In this case, I dont care that the value is higher than the maximum value of the signed integer type.  I just want it to convert to whatever the bitvalues represent as a signedinteger.  In other words, I would expect it to result in a negative number.  p  pHowever, with VB.NET, the codeCTypecode operation doesnt work that way or any of the other conversion functions like codeCShortcode andcodeCIntegercode.  When you try to convert an unsigned value that is higher than the desired signedtypes maximum value, it throws an codeOverflowExceptioncode rather than returning a negative number.  For instancep  precodeDim x As UShort  UShort.MaxValue Dim y As Short  CShortx   Throws OverflowException codepre  pIts worth mentioning, too, that the codeDirectCastcode operation cannot be used to cast the value between the signed and unsigned types, since neither type inherits or implements the other.  For instancep  precodeDim x As UShort  UShort.MaxValue Dim y As Short  DirectCastx, Short   Wont compile Value of type UShort cannot be converted to Short codepre  pI have figured out one way to do what I want, but it seems unnecessarily ugly.  Heres how I got it to workp  precodeDim x As UShort  UShort.MaxValue Dim y As Short  BitConverter.ToInt16BitConverter.GetBytesx, 0   y gets set to 1 codepre  pLike I said, that works, but if theres an easier, cleaner way of doing it in VB.NET, Id love to know what it is.p

Negative 5615 pIve been researching about interrupts on the x86 and how a kernel handles the various interrupts using interrupt handlers. But one thing confuses me though.brbrI know that interrupts could be hardwaregenerated, such as disk and timer interrupts, or they could be CPU exceptions such as page faults, divide by zero exceptions etc. What confuses me is that some int codes are used for handling both INT 08  0F in particular. For example, Ralf Browns list says that the INT 09h interrupt doubles as both the codeKEYBOARD DATA READYcode hardware interrupt and the codeCOPROCESSOR  SEGMENT OVERRUNcode exception.brbr So my question is, given interrupts like these, how does an interrupt handler know which interrupt to handlep

So I have read the official apis and prepared my design how to capture that particular contact.p  pSo what I thinked at the startp  ol liWe will store all the contact IDs, deleted flag and versionli liWhenever contacts get changed I will get my tables row count and row count from Androids system.li liIf my rowcount is less than systems row count then a contact has been deleted.li liIf my rowcount is greater than systems row count then a contact has been added.li liAnd if these are not the cases then one of the contacts version has been changed.li ol  pThen I have learned that Android doesnt delete the contact if it is deleted by user, but it sets 0 on deleted flag. So in these cases the row count will be same.p  pAndroid also changes the row ID of a contact many times as stated in the official docs. So how can we uniquely identify them like lookup uri and if not then we have to put observer for that also. p  pSo I just wanna know what I have thought is correct or not. And in the case a contact is added will it be added to the last row of cursor or not means if I check the last row of system database for contacts will it give me the contact added or not.p  pPlease help me to understanding the architecture of Android contacts.p

In this case it was a 0. That indicates department 0 which is all departments.

If this setting is not checked then when you create your starting bank rec for each department you will get a 1 to the right of the bank rec for department 1 and so on.

There are many such images in the list. 2 In the javascript code I have loop that loops each image and puts them on the canvas. 3 The issue is that the all the images are stacked over one another as if all the images get the coordinates of the first image.p  pAny ideas what might be happeningp  pIs there a way to know when the first image is loaded on the canvas and only then load the next image, like callback sort.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 5615 pIm developing a standalone application that uses c to crunch some numbers, and a single web app as frontend, using ember.p  pIve thought that I could create an emberdata adapter to handle communication between javascript and c. The communication would be then driven by changes in the model When a user action triggers a change in the model, then some action may be required in the backend. p  pExamplep  pA model could be Date day of the year, day of month, month.  When the user changes any of these parameters, the updated model is passed to the backend, which updates the other two. After the backend has updated all the model parameters, it would trigger a refresh on the frontend.p  pThe backend operation could be much more complex, but that is the basic idea some properties depend on others, but they are calculated by the backend, on the other side of the emberdata adapter.p  pThe advantage is that in the future itd be simple to reuse the frontend, by simply switching the adapter, so it may be that a browser based front end can be linked with a more powerful backend on a HTTP server.p  pHowever, Im not sure this is an adequate use of emberdata. Id be using emberdata for data persistence, but not only for that, as the models are also modified by the backend.p  pSo, the question is, do you think this scheme makes sense, or is this a bad idea In the later case, could someone please indicate some better alternativep  pThanks, Eloyp

Ive tried switching position to outerposition, which should make it so that none of them overlap, but that doesnt seem to work either.p  pI have seen a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14273315matlabsecondsubplotdisappearingmatlab second subplot disappearinga, but when I specify the position in that manner codesubplotposition,xpos,ypos,width,heightcode, it writes over the plots that are already there. If I place that code ibeforei I plot, the plots resize as soon as I issue the plot command.p

Negative 5615 pIve recently deployed a Rails 4 site to Heroku and Ive noticed a problem with my menu bar. Im using Foundation so that, on small screens, the menu items on the navbar become a clickable dropdown menu. Im also using a helper to get a gravatar, shamelessly copied from Michael Hartls excellent Rails Tutorial book. Ive noticed though, that on pages that have this gravatar the clickable menu doesnt initially work. If I refresh the page it does though. In my development environment it seems to work without refreshing the page as well, so I think that this is due to a pipeline problem. Has anyone else experienced something similarp

Negative 5615 pIs there a failsafe way to get data with cells containing multiline utf8 text with many columns from R to SPSS Preferably with conserved types.p  ul lipIf you say CSV, you may not have tried transferring 2700 columns with the occasional cell containing multiline text and utf8 characters. It seems impossible. p  ul liSPSS fails if there is the occasional cell containing several lines will see it as several cases, codeDELCASEcode doesnt fix this and requires you to know the number of columns. li liOpenOffice would properly handle charset and multilines but it cant handle that many columns.li liExcel can deal with many columns. It will open commaseparated files, not tabseparated files correctly by default, but it botches diacritics. If you use the importfeature to fix utf8 it botches multiline text.li ulli lipIf you say codexlsxwrite.xlsxcode this works, but takes excruciatingly long 10m and before SPSS will eat the generated xlsx files, I have to manually open and resave them in Excel I havent yet found out what SPSS doesnt like about them, it thinks theyre single column.pli lipI havent tried setting up a database and using RMySQL  ODBC in Excel or SPSS yet, because it seemed a bit overkill then. Doesnt seem so overkill in comparison anymore, but now I doubt that ODBC will do what it should in Excel or SPSS. Is this a proven waypli ul  pstrongEditstrong in reply to a comment suggesting codeforeignwriteForeigncodep  pwriteForeign doesnt save to .sav directly, it saves a CSV file like this codewrite.tabledfn, file  datafile, row.names  FALSE, col.names  FALSE, sep  ,, quote  FALSE, na  , eol  ,ncode and generates .sps files for import. p  pIt fails with my original data because my variable names exceed 8 chars and I would get duplicate names through truncation, not surprising with 2700 vars. SPSS can actually deal with this using the routes I described. If I use a subset designed to exhibit the known pitfalls, it fails with Cannot handle character variables longer than 255, but I wouldnt be surprised if it failed with multiline character input in general too, because SPSS doesnt seem to be able to deal with this during CSV import.p

Negative 5615 pI am working with random forest for a supervised classification problem, and I am using the kmeans clustering algorithm to split the data at each node. I am trying to calculate the time complexity for the algorithm. From what I understand the the time complexity for kmeans is p  blockquote   pOn middot K middot I middot d p blockquote  pwherep  ul lin is the number of points,li liK is the number of clusters,li liI is the number of iterations, andli lid is the number of attributes.li ul  pThe k, I and d are constants or have an upper bound, and n is much larger as compared to these three, so I suppose the complexity is just On.p  pThe random forest, on the other hand, is a divideandconquer approach, so for n instances the complexity is On middot logn, though I am not sure about this, correct me if i am wrong. p  pTo get the complexity of the algorithm do i just add these two thingsp
Negative 5615 pIve managed to implement and test my function wrapper implementation, however, the interface isnt as nice as it should bep  precodetemplate lt typename F, F f gt void registerfunction const char name       int lf luaState   functionwrapperlt F, f gt     registernativefunction lf, name   codepre  pWhile this works as expected, the usage requires to explicit template parametersp  precoderegisterfunctionlt decltypehello, amphello gt hello  codepre  pObviously the first parameter could be deduced from the first one, so ideally Id like to just have  p  precoderegisterfunctionlt amphello gt hello  codepre  pIs it possible Is there a neater way to do itp  hr  pstrongUpdatestrong Answering the question, why is the parameter templated instead of passedp  pMany binders including Lua ones, as this is particularly designed for Lua pass functions by valuep  precoderegisterfunctionhello, amphello codepre  pThis is indeed more readable, and from the interface side more easily implementable. But that also means that the adress of the function needs to be stored somewhere.p  pTo bind a function to Lua we need it to have the following prototypep  precodeint luaCFunction luaState  codepre  pNo other information is passed, hence this is the entry and information we get when a bound function is called from Lua. p  pIf the binding is done at compile time, we can provide a separate function by templates in the code that will be executed from Lua, giving us comparable performance to handwritten bindings, especially if the compiler optimizes away the boilerplate code.p  pIf the binding is done at runtime, then we cannot create new functions and need a global function that somehow knows what function should it dispatch the call to. Normally, we wouldnt be able to get the information at all, but existing compiletime Lua binders take advantage of Lua custom perfunction userdata or closures to store the additional information needed to perform the execution. However, this has a significant performance hit compared to a handwritten binding, because of possible additional memory allocations and closure dispatching.p  pIve had problems with perfomance of the runtime version in a previous binding implementation although a very stressed one which ended up in rewriting the most stressed parts into handwritten bindings, and, considering that this time I plan to do the lua calls in a realtime rendering loop, I want to find a solution that will be closer to handwritten performance.p  pIf we pass the function as a parameter, we obviously cannot create the function binding at compile time.p

Negative 5615 pI have a situation where Id like to build MVC style views at runtime using their EditorForDisplayFor templates or something similar.p  pIdeally our application would let the user choose which fields they want in their UI so they can add remove any as they see fit, to this end I thinking itd be handy to be create viewmodel classess at runtime and add the various dataannotation attributes to them according to what user selects ie. stringlength, required etc.p  pOne thing I need to be able to support is changing of the generated classes at runtime without affecting other users or having to do a full iisreset.p  pTo go about this Ive been doing a bit of research and it seems like there might be 3 different approaches, CodeDom, RunSharp  Relfection.Emit,Roslyn.p  pFrom what I can tell reflection.EmitRunsharp would allow me to create the classes and add attibutes and properties to them at runtime and probably also modify them when I need to without adverse effects.p  pIm not sure if Roslyn would allow this, I havent been able to track down any simple examples of creating a class with properties or attributes in it, and Ive seen a few mentions that Roslyns output is immutable so Im not sure how that goes for allowing me to modify it at a later date without adverse effects.p  pIn general from what Ive seen most people dont recommend CodeDom so Im not entirely sure if I should bother going down that route.p  pCan anyone give me an idea of which of these directions might be viable for mep

Negative 5615 pSpent all day so far trying to getting what I thought was a very trivial task done. My work has some dedicated web servers server 2008R2, IIS7. Currently everything done here before has just been asp.net webforms. For a new project I want to finally introduce them to MVC. I have a vanilla MVC application created in VS2013. I walked through some different sites and got it set up on my local IIS full, not express just fine. I can hit localhost and see the site I created. I am using web deploy, and it worked very well. p  pAfter that I moved on to our development server. I set it all up the same i.e new website in iis, web deploy set up with proper credentials, etc. Publishing from VS works. On the development server I see all the files there, but in IIS on the server via RDP session I cannot browse to it. It does strongnotstrong give me a 404 or 503 error, internet explorer just tells me that it cant find the address.p  pBased off the many, many articles I went through I did the followingp  ol liaspnetregiis.exe i 32 and 64 bitli liMade sure the server has Web Deploy 3.5 and Web Deploy tools 2.1 installed.li liAdded some lines to my web.config see belowemem.li limade sure the server had .net 4.5 and mvc installed.li ol  pAfter all that it still will not show me the site. Anything I am missing I would love to find a tutorial to walk me through babystep by babystep, but all I see out there assumes that you already have x and y set up, or you already know iis like the back of your hand.

This is what exactly happened. First I created an aspx page and incorporated one of JQuery EasyUI demo sample and when I run it the output was really unacceptable. But after trying other demo it worked as well as the first demo when I tried it for the second time. Now I created a new ASP.NET project and do the same thing and woh its not working for all demos I tried creating a new project to other pc running window 7 and Im getting the same bad output. Im using xp on the other computerp  pstrongBrowser Compatibilitystrongp  pAll the demos are working properly when I downloaded JQuery EasyUI. From my first concern after creating a new asp.net project from my other computer and run with disoriented output I gave up and just close my VS 2008. I tried running the the demos again under SRWare Iron  Chromium browser and for some reason its not giving me the output that I expected. I Tried Chrome and still the same issue but when I used Firefox it worked I tried using Chrome again as if its a joke it worked as well. But its still not working in my updated SRWare Iron  Chromium browser though I downloaded JQuery EasyUI using it and run almost all the demos using it and work properly BEFORE.p  pI dont really have any idea what is happening. By the way I used to computers one from my house and the other is from my office.p  pPlease help me with this I really need advice or answers regarding this.p

Negative 5615 pIm working on a kind of javascript textbased game engine. I have a javascript object with an onuse method. This works fantastically when I use it like thisp  precodevar button  new CanvasObject button.text  test  Necessary for the next code sample button.onuse  function button.x  1   Some simple reaction codepre  pI have code in a Canvas object that when drawing a CanvasObject will wrap it in a span tag like sop  precodeltspan onclick  function button.x  1 gttestltspangt  Or to make the HTML cleaner ltspan onclick  canvas.callFunction5gttestltspangt  where canvas.callFunction will call the function needed.  Canvas keeps an array of functions that can be called. codepre  pThe Canvas will call the function, and since it uses absolute terms, the line button.x  1, will work fine. The problem is that I have another class that I extended from CanvasObject, for example, ButtonObject. I want the class definition to have an onuse function that is already defined. For example using the inheritance technique lined out a hrefhttpwww.crockford.comjavascriptinheritance.html relnofollowhereap  precodeButtonObject.methodonuse, function    this.x  Some function requiring this.  codepre  pWhen I called a function from the HTML using the first technique, my engine would just call it as an anonymous function. Then, this then would be defined as the window. I want every instance of ButtonObject to have the same onuse function, so defining it each time like I did with CanvasObject seems like a lot of extra code. One possible solution I thought of was to modify the way my engine works such that each object is given a name property, that is equivalent to its javascript name. This way the engine could simple write the string like thisp  precodeinnerHTML   ltspan onclick  buttonObjectInstance.name  .onusegt  codepre  pBut this technique would require me to state the name of the object twice, every time I instantiate it, like thisp  precodevar startButton  ButtonObjectstartButton codepre  pIs this truly my only option Or is there way to call a function in the context of the object without having the name of that object p

The problem is resolved now, and as they tactfully pointed out, the problem in this case was the programmer specifically not thinking it all the way through  I wish I could accept both as answers.p  pstrongNOTE  To say I am a newbie to postgresql is to insult the newbiesstrongp  pI am writing a web app which will utilize a PostgreSQL database for its data storage.  In what I have done so far, I have managed a good grasp of the syntax for creating queries, and retrieving results from them, whether it be for a lookup, a deletion, an insertion, or an update.  I have run in to one quandary however.p  pTo avoid SQL injection issues, the use of codepgpreparepgexecutecode or codepgqueryparamscode is recommended.

But each query is then a 4 step process,p  ol liprepare the query string itself,li liprepare the query on the db use pgprepareli liexecute the query pgexecuteli lihandlemanipulate the returned data.li ol  pBecause this is a PHP script, the prepared query is not automatically deallocated upon script termination, so it needs to be done manually via call likep  pcodepgquerydbconn, DEALLOCATE querynamecodep  pHowever, the codeDEALLOCATEcode SQL command returns no useful information regarding success or failure, so when attempting to determine the results of the codeDEALLOCATEcode instruction, it becomes a mess trying to determine ifp  ol liThe query succeeded and so did the deallocationli liThe query succeeded and the deallocation failedli lithe query failed and so did the deallocationli liThe query failed and the deallocation succeeded I dont believe this can even happenli ol  pMy question is then twofoldp  ol liHow barring repeated queries to the server regarding the deallocated query can I determine if the deallocation was successful, andli liIs there an easy way to determine which part of the query failed  in the event of a failure the deallocation, or the sending of the query itselfli ol  pThis question gives a partial solution, but is no help in finding the SOURCE of the error. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq11930201658512Php check if an pgprepare prepared statement already existap
Negative 5615 pOk I think its going to be a short question. I have an ArrayList that I sorted by date, of course I see it works but I would also like to write a test for it.p  pI want to check if next value date in my list is lower then previous one. I am able to do that with using some codeforcode s and adding temp list, but Im wondering if theres a easier solution.

Negative 5615 pSo Ive come to a point where I need to implement an SQLite database for my app. Following The Busy Coders guide to Android Development I have created a DatabaseHelper class that extends codeSQLiteOpenHelpercode.p  pOne of my use cases is to run a query against the database and display the results on a codeListViewcode within a codeFragmentcode I use fragments from the support library.p  pFrom what I understand, using codemanagedQuerycode is not really appropriate and even if it were it isnt recommended due to the fact that some of the logic encapsulated inside this method is actually executed on the main thread, specifically codereQuerycode which to my understanding is performed when the codeActivitycode is restarted.p  pSo Ive been trying to get acquainted with the codeLoadercode class for the first time, only to see this p  pcodeThe only supplied concrete implementation of a Loader is CursorLoader, and that is only for use with a ContentProvidercodep  pMy initial thought was to implement my own content provider and perhaps prevent other apps from getting access to it, then I read the following in the codeContentProvidercode documentation via developer.android.comp  pcodeYou dont need a provider to use an SQLite database if the use is entirely within your own application.codep  pIve also been playing with thisp  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comcommonsguycwacloaderexhttpsgithub.comcommonsguycwacloaderexap  pYet I am not familiar with this project, and not sure if it can be used on a production environment.p  pSo, right now all I can think of is creating a bunch of codeAsyncTaskcode instances within my codeFragmentcode and manage their lifecycle appropriately, make sure theyre cancelled whenever needed and whatnot.p  pAre there any other optionsp

Negative 5615 pIve been running into all sorts of issues using ArcGIS ZonalStats and thought R could be a great way. Saying that Im fairly new to R, but got a coding background.  The situation is that I have several rasters and a polygon shape file with many features of different sizes though all features are bigger than a raster cell and the polygon features are aligned to the raster.  Ive figured out how to get the mean value for each polygon feature using the raster library with extractp  precodeload packages required requirergdal requiresp requireraster requiremaptools  Set the working directory datdir lt testdata  Read in a ESRI grid of water depth ras lt readGDALtestdatarasterplsmrp1000w001001.adf convert it to a format recognizable by the raster package ras lt rasterras  read in polygon shape file proxNA lt readShapePolytestdataproxyPLproxyWDNAtest  plot raster and shp plotras plotproxNA  calc mean depth per polygon feature unweighted  only assigns grid to district if centroid is in that district proxNAdataRP1000 lt extractras, proxNA, fun  mean, na.rm  TRUE, weights  FALSE check results headproxNA  plot depth values  spplotproxNA[,RP1000] codepre  pThe issue I have is that I also need an area based ratio between the area of the polygon and all non NA cells in the same polygon. I know what the cell size of the raster is and I can get the area for each polygon, but the missing link is the count of all nonNA cells in each feature. I managed to get the cell number of all the cells in the polygon codeproxNAdataCnumb1000 lt cellFromPolygonras, proxNAcodeand Im sure there is a way to get the actual value of the raster cell, which then requires a loop to get the number of all nonNA cells combined with a count, etc.  BUT, Im sure there is a much better and quicker way to do that If any of you has an idea or can point me in the right direction, I would be very grateful Many Thanksp

Negative 5615 pSo, i was very excited this morning when I found i could edit the html of my Drupal content page. However, upon testing the code and adding a second article, a scroll bar appeared but my footer disappeared. If you look on this site  a hrefhttpwww.tobynews.compostitnode relnofollowtobynews.compostitnodeap  pat the source code towards the bottom youll find the footer, but when you look at the page there is no footer. Ive tried removing body padding, adjusting height, etc. but nothing really seems to work. It also seems to happen on another page of mine. Im wondering if maybe there is just a certain height that it must stay in. I have little experience with footers so Im still learning. p

Negative 5615 pI have had this problem for years, but not as frequently as today. This prompted me to ask this question once and for all.p  pSometimes today for almost every logic my trivial PHP code fails with a parse error. Sometimes PHP is right, but way to often there is no mistake and when writing the exact same code again it works without whining. Copy and pasting the code does not work, it has to be typed again in full.p  pToday, I have meticulously typed down every character exactly as the line failing and then removing the old one, just to have the script working. For examplep  precode1    foreach POST[datapositions] AS k gt v  2     3     codepre  pthrew a parse error on line 1. I bumped the code down to row 2 and wrote the exact same line 1 again I check several times that every character is the same, then removing line 2, and it works. Another examplep  precode1    if isnumerick  2     3     codepre  palso fails on row 1. When I retype it, it works. Copy and pasting the line again does not work.p  pI am 100 certain the code is fine, so it leads me to believe its some kind of encoding issue and that certain parts of the code is attributed a bad encoding like pasting formatted text into a email.p  pIm currently using Sublime Text but have had the same types of mistaken parse errors in Notepad and the old Homesite editor as well, running MAMP on OS X, but it has happened on my Windows desktop machine as well.p  pDoes anyone have any clue what I can do Its super annoying to write the code several times and having it fail on you randomly.p  pEDIT reopened I still cant get it to work properly. No matter if I paste it to Notepad or if I type a completely new file from scratch. Ive checked all through the database to the server to my editor that they all use UFT8. Its almost always IFstatements that break sometimes I have to type them down 3 or 4 times before it works. Trivial stuff, like codeif a  3 a  6 code.p  pEDIT solved Scroll down for the solution, I answered the question myself.p

Negative 5615 pI am reading about splay trees by Robert Sedgwick. Following is text snippet from sectionp  pIn the rootinsertion method, we accomplished our primary objective of bringing the newly inserted node to the root of the tree by using left and right rotations. In this section, we examine how we can modify root insertion such that the rotations balance the tree in a certain sense, as well.p  pRather than considering recursively the single rotation that brings the newly inserted node to the top of the tree, we consider the two rotations that bring the node from a position as one of the grandchildren of the root up to the top of the tree. First, we perform one rotation to bring the node to be a child of the root. Then, we perform another rotation to bring it to the root. There are two essentially different cases, depending on whether or not the two links from the root to the node being inserted are oriented in the same way. . Splay BSTs are based on the observation that there is an alternative way to proceed when the links from the root to the node being inserted are oriented in the same way Simply perform two rotations at the root.p  pAdditional information is present at slide 4 at following linkp  pa hrefhttpwww.cs.princeton.educoursesarchivespr04cos226lecturesbalanced.4up.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.cs.princeton.educoursesarchivespr04cos226lecturesbalanced.4up.pdfap  pMy question isp  ol lipWhat does author mean by orientation herepli lipRequest to given an example for orienations differ and orientation match.pli ol  pThanksp

Negative 5615 pI am setting up a chart that has the min and max values set. Every 10 seconds the graph is updated with new data and the series is pushed over.

Negative 5615 pI am currently facing the problem of securing up an API my clients use on their websites. However because this API is called by JavaScript Im finding it hard to figure out a way to only allow these access the APIURLs.p  pSo how would I go about this How would I only allow access to these links. Obviously the links could be compromised but I would like to have a way to deny the script from operating if it hasnt come from an verified site. ATM all I can think of using is the Referrer header which as we all know, can be faked. Is there a way I can trace the source of the request If so, how Because then I could just check the source of the request and if it isnt an allowed source then just issue a 403 Forbidden. p  pThanks.

Negative 5615 pIm very new to MVC. How do I perform a codeResponse.Clearcode from within an MVC3 aspx pagep  pI have triedp  precodeResponse.Clear  ViewContext.HttpContext.Response.Clear codepre  pNeither of them seem to function at all, in that any HTML content before the statements remain in the output. The only thing that seems to work is codeResponse.Closecode, but of course that doesnt allow me to output anything afterwards.p  pThe reason for wanting this simply a testingdebugging exercise  I just want to be able to clear the buffered output, from inline code in the aspx page, and output something else afterwards. Similar to what one could do with web forms.p  pNote, I dont want to perform this within the controller, as it means recompiling every time I make a change, as well as losing session state. The point of this is to fiddle within the aspx page to avoid recompiling each time.p

Negative 5615 pIn my current project I am using two list boxes to show progress through a set of items. The selected item shows the currently running item. For obvious reasons the user needs to not be able to change the selected item via the gui. I accomplished this by trapping out the mouse events. p  pProblem is, I still want the user to be able to use the scroll bar to see their all of the data points. Is there a way to allow for this interaction Basically what I want is an enable list box, that allows the user to use the scroll bar, but not alter the data area. p  pI have done some research and could not find a reasonable solution. p

Negative 5615 pI have been working on creating a program similar to MS Paint. I have several of the features it has down but the one which is currently giving me trouble is the rectangular selection tool. My program currently draws everything on the panel and saves it all in an ArrayList so each shape can be redrawn in Paint. p  pLike MS paint I would like the user to be able to select a section of the drawing on the panel and either copy it, move it, resize it, or even delete it. I was thinking about having the user draw a rectangle amp saving the information for it. Then taking that information for the rectangle, passing them to create a new Bitmap. I would then paint a new rectangle in the background color to give the appearance that the selected area was removed when the selected portion is moved. It sounded okay until I realized that I couldnt use the Graphics.FromImage on the PaintEventArgs variable passed to Paint which made my idea useless. Not sure if that makes sense so my apologies if its a confusing mess. p  pIve been searching the internet for some assistance and I havent found much to help so either this is very easy to do, very difficult, or rectangle selection tool is not the proper term. Any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated Thank you for your time   p

Negative 5615 pThis question may or may not be truly Haskellspecific, but it concerns a slight annoyance that I am facing with a certain programming task.p  pI have written a program in Haskell which is mostly universal for the type of problem I am trying to solve, but includes two dependent components a runtime estimation function for a script, calculated based on trial runs at a certain benchmark, and a filename conversion function, which is tailored to the naming scheme of the files I was working with. Naturally, if I want to use the script with performances other than the benchmark, or I find that the estimates are too conservative, I would like to change the function used to estimate the runtime, and likewise I would like to be able to modify the filename conversion function if I ever need to work with different files with different naming schemes.p  pHowever, the remote computer that I am running my scripts on does not have GHC or runhaskell installed, so I am having to modify, compile, and reupload the code from my local machine, which is a bit of a hassle. My question is, is there an easy way to implement changes in some components of my code without having to recompile in order for the changes to be reflected at calltimep  pI apologize if my description is vague, and have included the gory details below, as I do not want to clutter my question with unnecessary details from the outset, should the details prove unnecessary.p  pI am writing this code in Haskell mainly because that is the language that I best know how to implement the methods in while I understand that other languages might be more portable, I am not sufficiently familiar with other languages in order to implement this without having to read a lot of documentation and go through multiple revisions in order to get it to work. If achieving the flexibility I want with Haskell is impractical, I can appreciate that, but I would rather know that Haskell cannot do it than receive suggestions of other languages that can.p  h2Specific Detailsh2  pI am writing code to run independent jobs on a loadsharing cluster, and I therefore want to most closely estimate the time required for a particular job, without undershooting and causing the job to be terminated, and without overshooting and thereby lowering the priority of the jobs. I am basing my time estimate on the size of the inputs to the job program, and I have gathered enough realworld data to derive an approximate quadratic relation between size and time.p  pThe way I am currently assigning timeestimates, and thereby establishing a job order, for the inputs is by parsing the output of codeducode with a Haskell script, performing a computation, and writing the time results to a new file, which is then read in a loop by the jobassignment script.p  pThe job is being run for paired files, which share a common name up to a certain point, where the last common element I wish to retain is an s, with no further s characters in either name from then on. Therefore, I am traversing the names backwards and dropping until I reach an s. My code is included below. It is liberal with comments, which might help or might confuse.

The sizetime conversion is extrapolated from experimental data,   with only the upper extremes considered in order to prevent timeout,   rounding in the quadratic term, and a lineardegree time padding added   to allow for upper extremes. If modifications are to be made to any   coefficients, it is recommended that only linear and constant terms be increased,   and decreases should only be made after performing sufficient alignments to collect   enough file sizeactual computation time pairs to verify that the padding is excessive,   and to determine coefficients that more closely follow the trend of the actual data, with   the conditions that no data point must exceed the approximation curve, and that sufficient padding   must be provided to allow for potential inconsistency in the time required for any given size of alignment.   size2time  String gt Int,String size2time sfstring  let sizefile[]  words sfstring  parses out size and filename                          x  fromIntegral read size  Int  floating point from numeric string              time  floor  0.000025  x  2  0.03  x  10  apply floored conversion              tfstring  time,file              in tfstring       removes all characters in the filename after s, which properly scrubs files of the format   HsR.fq.gz, where the  is either 1 or 2.

Negative 5615 pSo in my tetris game, Im working on rotation. Ive found an algorithim that works for every piece but the square piece ironically, the only one that doesnt even need to rotate. I know I could just check to see if the piece isnt a square then rotate it if it isnt, but thats just cheap. So heres the codep  precodepieceShape.setTextureimgr.GetImagesquare.png         forint i  0 i lt 4 i             sfRectangleShape rect             ifi lt 2                 rect.setPositionpieceShape.getPosition.x, i  10             else                 rect.setPositionpieceShape.getPosition.x  10, i  2  10             rect.setSizesfVector2f10, 10             rect.setFillColorsfColorBlue             pieceRectangles.pushbackrect                  originCount  10 codepre  pHere, Im creating all four blocks that make up a square piece. 10 is the width of each box 4 boxes per square in pixels. For all other pieces, I set originCount to 5 so the origin falls in the middle of the first box created. The originCount comes into play in the RotateRightLeft functionsp  precodevoid GamePieceRotateRight     int newx, newy     sfVector2f originpieceRectangles[0].getPosition.x  originCount, pieceRectangles[0].getPosition.y  originCount     forint i  0 i lt 4 i         newx  pieceRectangles[i].getPosition.y  origin.x  origin.y         newy  origin.x  origin.y  pieceRectangles[i].getPosition.x  10         pieceRectangles[i].setPositionnewx, newy       codepre  pIn theory, the origin has now been set to the middle of the squares sprite, and the boxes should rotate about that point i.e. appear to not even move. But the boxes shoot to the left 10 pixels on the first click, go up maybe 2 pixels on click two, etc. Im clearly missing something, but whatp

You wouldnt want to send user credentials over the wire for each request.p  pIm quite confuse. So if stateless session with cookie maintain the state so its mean that stateless session with cookie session stateful p  pAnother think. I found information that session stateless is client side session and stateful is server side session. How we can discuss about client side session if stateless session does not maintain session  Thanks for every answers.p
Negative 5615 pI have a scenario where a C library is consuming a mixed mode C library. The use case is as followsp  p1 The C code initializes a listener from the library managed c, which initializes a listener from native C.p  p2 The native code receives a message and parses it, then passes it to the managed c via IJW codep  p3 The managed c calls a delegate from the C code with the messagep  pThis all works fine, except for the very last part  actually including the message. The C code cant access the data type defined in the managed C. When you navigate to the structs definition, it looks like thisp  precodenamespace NativeWrapper     [CLSCompliantfalse]    [NativeCppClass]    [UnsafeValueType]    public struct MyDataType          codepre  pAs you can see  it decries it as unsafe and wipes out the fields. Ive seen solutions to this problem where a third library, in C, declares a struct, and both the C and the managed C use it. I imagine that would work, but Im trying to avoid creating a third library for one small file...this component is part of a large system, Id like to keep the number of DLLs Im adding to it as small as possible.p  pSo, the question is, is there a way I can define a struct in managed C that the C code can references I know how to define a ref class, thats how my listener is set up, but Id like this to be a struct.p

So instead of just simply finding duplicates among the entire string of names, I would also like to find pairings among partial segments of the Names column. p  pIs this possible to do within Excel or would I need to use a programming language to accomplish the taskp  pWhile I can manually do this, it represents a lot of time that could be used towards other things.

Negative 5615 pI am currently developing a code that allows the rotation of a 3D sphere using MATLABs GUIDE.p  pThe method used is using quaternions, and it works fine actually. The issue is the reverse rotation, where a sphere rotates one direction but when pressing a button in the UI, it reverses direction. From many online sources, it says that the inverse rotation of a quaternion is equal to negating the vector terms and dividing both scalar and vector terms by the magnitude. Implementing this into the MATLAB code, the sphere does not smoothly transition and rotate.p  pIve tested SLERP and LERP methods but that warps the spherep  pDoes anyone know if this is the correct methodology, or what would bep  pThanks in advance,  Tonyp

So my output need to be like thisp  precodeArray[       [                 first array[ 24, 58],         last  array[ 25,59]         ,                  first array[ 25, 59],its inside that array couse the first value is the same like the last value before that.         last  array[ 23,57]         ,                  first array[ 25, 59],         last  array[ 26, 54]                 ],        [                  first array[ 23, 58],         last  array[ 22,     58]         ,                   first array[ 22, 58],         last  array[ 23, 54]         and these are similar values couse last and the first are the same        ]       ] codepre  pmaybe this is more understandable what i need in the end. p

Negative 5615 pIm using AbstractBaseUser for my user models in various projects. Updating to Django 1.8 RC1 works smoothly and I can run the migrate management command. However, when trying to create a fresh database table layout from scratch, I get the following errorp  precodepython manage.py migrate gtgtgt ... gtgtgt ... gtgtgt django.db.utils.ProgrammingError relation authgroup does not exist codepre  pAll works perfectly with Django 1.7.x and I cannot find anything about this issue elsewhere. So, is it a big with the RC1 version or did something change that Im not aware of in Django 1.8 Unfortunately, the error message doesnt really help ... but Im pretty sure it has to do with the automatic migrations that come with the new Django version.p

Negative 5615 pSo, I am coding a game that will use keyboard input.  I track the KeyDown and KeyUp events similar to herep  pa hrefhttpnokarma.org20110227javascriptgamedevelopmentkeyboardinputindex.html relnofollowhttpnokarma.org20110227javascriptgamedevelopmentkeyboardinputindex.htmlap  pHowever, there are use cases where KeyupKeydown events can be missed.  I tried adding a blur to my body element, but there are use cases where it doesnt blur.  The simplest example I can give is if a user right clicks on an area outside of the document, say on a book mark, the browser doesnt give any events to the DOM and the context menu starts getting keyboard inputs.  SO, if the user was holding the UP arrow and whilst still holding the up arrow, right clicks on a bookmark, and then releases the arrow key, the corresponding KeyUp event will never be given to the browser.  If the user presses the key again, then the key will reset, but that is still a bug.p  pFor Chrome and Firefox I could use the PointerLock API, but I wanted to know if there was something else I could do.  I thought about blurring automatically if the mouse leaves the client area, but when Im playing games I usually move the mouse to a bottom corner.  AFAIK one cannot manually poll the keyboard.  Are there any work arounds that I have missedp
Negative 5615 pI have 456 .PNG icons with a white image on a blue background, but the background is pixelated.

Negative 5615 pIm trying to use FFmpeg in a new app and found these two repositories on GitHub a hrefhttphiteshsondhi88.github.ioffmpegandroid relnofollowhttphiteshsondhi88.github.ioffmpegandroida and a hrefhttphiteshsondhi88.github.ioffmpegandroidjava relnofollowhttphiteshsondhi88.github.ioffmpegandroidjavaa.p  pWhat are their differences I mean, Android NDK is just a way to put native code together with your Java code, right If so, using FFmpegandroid as a shared native library and using FFmpegandroidjava which seems to be a java library that encapsulates calls to the shared native library, are the same thing. Or am I wrongp  pThank youp
Negative 5615 pI would like to time how long the program takes to insert in the tree to measure the efficiency of a TreeMaps inserting. I also want to measure how long it takes to sort separately. I am doing this for a report I am writing where I am comparing the inserting time and sorting time for a TreeMap, linkedList and ArrayList.

Negative 5615 pstrongCan I use the EF Reverse POCO generator directly against a SQL Database Projectstrongp  pI keep my SQL database definition in a Visual Studio SQL Database Project, which gives me some nice version control capabilities, schema comparison, and a few nifty deployment features. Sometimes I update the project files from a temporary database during development, but the versioncontrolled project is always the truth for any version.p  pIf I use the a hrefhttpefreversepoco.codeplex.com relnofollowEntityFramework Reverse POCO Code First Generatora, will I need to roundtrip my truth through an actual SQL database to generate POCO Or can I use the POCO generator against a VS Database Projectp  pI know that the schema of a database project has a sort of metapresence in various VS database interactions. For example, it shows up with a real database icon in the SQL Server Object Explorer. But I dont know if the codefirst generator coulddoes leverage a similar ability to query it for metadata.p

Negative 5615 pi am searching a way to check if user has watched the entire video on iOS device. I have tried 23 html5 video frameworks. Now i make tests with Popcorn.js.

I tried the seeked method but its not be triggered if an iOS user seeks backandforth. In desktop everything works great ofcourse...p
Negative 5615 pI am using google adsense responsive ads with Bootstrap and it works properly on page load. Also in a handheld device it detects the orientation properly and adjusts the ads immediatly.p  pHowever, when I resize my browser it does not react to it. Weird to claim responsiveness when there is no build in system to detect screen resize. I have thought to add an eventlistener, but is this a good work around or will it break I also thought of loading in different ad sizes with a few break point but I would like to avoid that and just use the responsive ad.p  pThanks in advance for any suggestions.p
Negative 5615 pI am doing a pagination script and I want to give users the ability to control how many results are shown in one page. I am doing this through the use of a GET variable, like this codeexample.orgarticles.phpcount10code.

I mostly do not want the user to be able to crash the script by injecting random text into the GET variables. How do I get the script to automatically detect noninteger values so that they can be dealt with instead of simply halting the codep

Negative 5615 h2use caseh2  pI am creating an OpenGL context of the most recent by Qt supported version. currently 4.3, core profilep  pClasses using OpenGL functions receives a reference to the QOpenGLContext.

So the version specified with setMajorVersion and setMinorVersion are completely ignored. That leads to the situation of handling a more recent version than the current stable Qt lib release is able to handle. So the call to contextinitializeOpenGLFunctions crashes with an memory access violation. p  h2workaround 2, restricted behaviorh2  pSo currently i have to create the 4.3 core profile context and have to use for all version functions also the 4.3. core profile.p  precodeauto glFuncs  contextgtversionFunctionsltQOpenGLFunctions43Coregt  codepre  pThis way is very odd, because i have to use all the new 4.3 functions in classes even if they use only 3.3 functionality. It would be nice to see at the requested version function, which OpenGL version is actually necessary for that specific class. This is not a desirable situation, because it unnecessarily restricts the usage of OpenGL 3.3. hardware.p  pSo please correct me, if i misunderstood the usage of requesting different version functions than the context is created for.

Negative 5615 pIm running into a bit of an issue solving a problem with some Angularjs functionality Im working on.p  pThe basic idea is that I have a system where certain criteria must be met before the user is allowed to advance to the next section of the app. One example of this is that a user must both add a comment, and click a link in the real app, this is a file download in order for them to advance.p  pYou can take a look at the full example here a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.netd81xxweu10 relnofollowhttpsjsfiddle.netd81xxweu10ap  pIll assume that the HTML is pretty self explanatory and move on to what Im doing with my Angular module. My app declaration and initialization are as followsp  precodevar myApp  angular.modulemyApp, [ngRoute]  myApp.runfunction rootScope       Both of these must be met in order for the user to proceed with specialbutton     rootScope.criteria           criteria1 false,         criteria2 false       codepre  pThis is pretty simple. Im attaching an object called criteria to the root scope of the application in order to make it accessible to my directives and controllers. I have a directive that renders the link which allows the user to advance once the criteria are met. In this example the text of the link changes from Waiting... to Click to proceed to indicate we may advance.p  precodemyApp.directivespecialButton, function rootScope      return          scope true,         template lta hrefgt linkText ltagt,         replace true,         link function scope, el, attrs              scope.linkText  Waiting...              var setLinkState  functioncurrentCriteria                  var criteriaMet  true                  forvar k in rootScope.criteria                      ifrootScope.criteria[k]  false                          criteriaMet  false                                                        ifcriteriaMet                      scope.linkText  Click to proceed                                             Watch for changes to this object at the root scope level             rootScope.watchCollectioncriteria, functionnewValues                  setLinkStatenewValues                             codepre  pSo in order to trigger the watch statement weve set on this directive I can add a comment as allowed by this controllerp  precodemyApp.controllercomments, function scope, rootScope      scope.commentText       scope.comments  []      scope.addComment  function           scope.comments.push commentText scope.commentText          scope.commentText             When the user adds a comment they have met the first criteria         rootScope.criteria.criteria1  true       codepre  pThe previous is my controller for displayingadding comments. I set criteria1 to true here to indicate the user has added a comment. This actually works fine, and the watchCollection in the specialButton directive is called as expected.p  pThe problem arises when I try to perform the same action from the link that must be clicked in order to advance. This is rendered with a directive as it is my understanding that in a case such as this a directive makes more sense than a controller, unlike the comment listform.p  precodemyApp.directiverequiredLink, functionrootScope      return          scope true,         template lta hrefgtClick meltagt,         replace true,         link functionscope, el, attrs              el.bindclick, functionevt                  evt.preventDefault                   When the user clicks this link they have met the second criteria                 rootScope.criteria.criteria2  true                             codepre  pAs you can see here I pass in rootScope just as in the controller. However when I set criteria2 to true the watchCollection is not triggered.p  pSo what ends up happening is if I add a comment first, then click the other button, I do not see specialButton update its text because the second change never triggers the watch. If, however, I click the link first, then add a comment, specialButton updates as expected. The click of requiredLink IS updating the data, but not triggering the watch. So when I then add a comment and the watch is triggered it sees that BOTH have been set to true.p  pThanks in advance for any help you can offer in resolving this issue I appreciate your time.p

Negative 5615 pIm running my CodedUI automation tests on a HyperV VM using Test Agents and Test Controllers. p  pThe VM where the tests are executed has the Test Agent on it which also takes up a good amount of CPU and the code is built on the Test Controller VM which is a different box.p  pThe program that is automated takes up quite a large amount of resources. At two separate points in one of the automation tests, the program freezes and I have to perform a hard shutdown to exit it. The code still runs in the background, but because the program is frozen, the test fails.p  pI have added up to 10 GBs of allocated memory, 8 processors, and changed settings on HyperV, but the CPU still maxes out when running the two specific portions of the test and then the program hangs. After the hang starts, the CPU goes back down but the program never recovers.p  pIve watched this program hang for at least 30 minute stretches before force closing it.p  pI have looked into the HyperV settings for this machine and adjusted them to see if that helped the issue.  Here is what the settings are currently set top  pstrongWindows Server 2012 R2strong strongMemorystrong Startup RAM 10000 MB         Dynamic memory is off         Memory Weight is near Highp  pstrongProcessorstrong intelr xeonr cpu e52630 v2  2.60ghz            Number of virtual processors 8            Virtual Machine Reserve 50            Virtual Machine Limit percentage 100            Relative Weight 200 strongOSstrong        Windows 7 professional wsp1 x64p  pMicrosoft VM BUS video device.p  pI can get the automation to run on my local machine which has an i7.p  pAny suggestions on what is happening here or what could improve this situation p  pThanks in advance for your help  I have racked my brains on this but I dont usually deal with IT issues.p

Negative 5615 pI have a project in which I have two different subprojects, the main library and a compiler for a programming language in a directory structure like thisp  precode build.gradle  src    library    compiler    ... codepre  pMy build.gradle looks like thisp  precodesourceSets      library              java                      srcDir srclibrary             srcDir srcasm                   compiler              java                      srcDir srccompiler                   ...    ...  task buildLibtype Jar, dependsOn classes      from sourceSets.library.output     classifier  dyvillibrary   task buildCompilertype Jar, dependsOn classes      from sourceSets.compiler.output     classifier  dyvilcompiler  codepre  pMy problem is that whenever I try to run the codebuildCompilercode task, the build fails and the Java Compiler gives me hundreds of errors in places where the compiler source code references classes in the library.

Negative 5615 pI have a SQLbased application and I like to cache the result using Redis. You can think of the application as an address book with multiple SQL tables. The application performs the following tasksp  p40 of the timep  ul liCreate a new record  Update an existing recordli liBulk update multiple recordsli liReview an existing recordli ul  p60 of the timep  ul liSearch records based on users criteriali ul  pThis is my current approachp  ul liThe system cache a record when a record is created or updated.li liWhen user performs a search, the system will cache the query result.li ul  pOn top of that, I have a Redis lookup table Redis Set which stores the MySQL record ID and the Redis cache key. That way I can delete the Redis caches if the MySQL record has been changed e.g., bulk update.p  pWhat if a new record is created after the system cache the search result If the new record matches the search criteria, the system will always return the old cache which does not include the new record, until the cache is deleted which wont happen until an existing record in the cache is updated.p  pThe search is driven by the users and the combination of the search condition is countless. It is not possible to evaluate which cache should be deleted when a new record is created.p  pSo far, the only solution is to remove all caches of a MySQL table when a record is created. However this is not a good choice because lots of records are created daily.p  pIn this situation, whats the best way to implement Redis on top of MySQLp

Negative 5615 pI work on iOS application with acts as Bluetooth peripheral. I need to implement a searching for my iOS peripheral from non iOS centrals. Im faced with a problem while my iOS application advertising in background mode. When it is advertising in foreground, my central can read primary service UUID from advertising data, but when it is advertising in background, I cant see the name or the UUID of peripheral  there is only Apple manufacturer data in advertising packet.p  pThe essence of the problem lies in the fact that my non iOS central cant determinate  is it advertising my peripheral in background or any other peripheral in background. I have to connect every iOS device with advertising in background, enumerate its services to look for my service UUID.p  pThe documentation says that during background advertising all service UUIDs go to special overflow area and only iOS devices can read it specifying service in CBCentralManagers scanForPeripherialWithServices method. It looks like Apple have an ability to check background advertising packet data for service UUID.p  pAfter searching on SO I found some interesting information about service hashed UUID. Background mode advertising packet always contains Apple manufacturer data 14 FF 4c 00 01 and undocumented 128 bit value, where one of these 128 bits equals 1. I tried to change my service UUID several times and found out than this 128 bit value after Apple manufacturer data changes too.p  ol liId like to use this value to filter peripherals around and reduce connections to wrong not mine peripherals. Can anyone give any information how this value depends on service UUID Is there any hash function that is used on specified service UUID in scanForPeripherialWithServices method li liCan I be sure that the background advertising packet will always be the same for the immutable service UUID which will never changeli liIs there any other way to send my custom information while advertising in background mode Maybe I can add my data into BLE SCAN RESPONSE packetli ol  pBest Regards, Dezmondp

Negative 5615 pIm currently trying to set up a website using Bolt CMS. For a simple contact form, Im trying to use the SimpleForms extension. For this, it seems I have to set up a mailoptions field in config.yml.  p  pNow, for the mail host I use Zoho Mail. I have successfully made an account, verified my domain and so on.

Negative 5615 pSo I have code that is blindingly fast.  But Im sure what Im doing is a Terrible Thing I just need someone to confirm this and give me a reason why.p  pI have to process a datafeed with 80,000 records, and it can match to any of 250,000 records by either network ID, an HR Personnel Number, or a combination of legal org code and a local ID.  None of these three identifiers are permanent  any of them could change, though usually not at that same time small miracles.  So I have nothing to leverage as a primary key, and users can match to more than one record coming back in the results.  In fact, those identifiers are not unique  I can have multiple matches against a particular HR Personnel Number, for example.  I need to flag users who have more than one active account, for example among other things.  Hopefully it goes without saying that this is strongnotstrong my code.p  pThe basic approach is to shred the 250k results coming back from the database into three lists, each keyed to one of those three identifiers.  Then for each datafeed record, I build a unioned list of matches from each.  Shockingly, this is slow.p  pIve tweaked the code to the point where it can consolidate matches for all 80,000 rows and execute validation checks against them in less than one second, but I think I may have had to sell my soul to do it.  The code below is only a small part of the solution, but its... questionable.p  precode Working with Typed DataTables DictionaryltDatafeedTableRow, ListltUserIdsTableRowgtgt datafeedUsersDictionary  new DictionaryltDatafeedTableRow, ListltUserIdsTableRowgtgt Dictionaryltstring, ListltUserIdsTableRowgtgt allLocalIdsDictionary  foreach DatafeedTableRow datafeedTableRow in stagingDataTable      datafeedUsersDictionary.AdddatafeedTableRow, new ListltUserIdsTableRowgt     God may have just killed a puppy   Populate three dictionaries  one for each identification type  These dictionaries all hold UserIdsTableRow objects  foreach DatafeedTableRow datafeedTableRow in stagingDataTable      ListltUserIdsTableRowgt currentRecordMatches  datafeedUsersDictionary[datafeedTableRow]      if stagingTableRow.IsLEGALORGIDNull ampamp datafeedTableRow.IsLOCALCOMPANYIDNull          localIdKey  new StringBuilder.AppenddatafeedTableRow.LEGALORGID                                         .Append                                         .AppenddatafeedTableRow .LOCALCOMPANYID                                         .ToString      if allLocalIdsDictionary.ContainsKeylocalIdKey          currentRecordMatches.AddRangeallLocalIdsDictionary[localIdKey].Whererow gt currentRecordMatches.Containsrow       codepre  pA good bit of code has been snipped, of course.  But because codedatafeedUsersDictionarycode is keyed to a row from the datafeeds typed DataTable, this is easyp  precodeListltDatafeedTableRowgt multipleActiveRecords  new ListltDatafeedTableRowgt multipleActiveRecords.AddRangedatafeedUsersDictionary.Whererow gt row.Value.Countactive gt active.SECURITYSTATUSCODE  ACTIVE                                                                                                 active.SECURITYSTATUSCODE  NEWUSER                                                                                                 active.SECURITYSTATUSCODE  TEMP LEAVE gt 1                                                       .SelectstagingTableRecord gt stagingTableRecord.Key codepre  pbr  Sometimes you have to sell your soul in the name of performance.  And sometimes you shouldnt do something because its dangerous or unpredictable VB 6 Window Handle references, anyone.  Which is this  p  pThe only reason I feel even remotely okay with it is because of functions like code.ContainsDataTableRowcode... this is really just the same thing, yesp
