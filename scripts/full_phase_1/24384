Positive 24384 pI just noticed a behavior change that seems related to migrating to iOS 9.p  pI have a codeUITableViewcode. In the first codeUITableViewCellcode I have a codeUIScrollViewcode that I use to page through images. It should only scroll strongleftltrightstrong. Finger dragging up and down should drag the codeUITableViewcode up and down. Up until iOS 9 it did do that beautifully...  Now when I compile for iOS9 devices or simulator I can still scroll the images strongleftltrightstrong but the table no longer scrolls up and down. Those touches just get sucked into the abyss.p  pLet me add that when I compile from Xcode 7 to my device running iOS 8.4 it still behaves as intended. Scrolls up and down when dragging in the embedded codeUIScrollViewcode.p  pFurthermore, when I download my last released version compiled on previously released Xcode for iOS 8.1 target I get the expected behavior on the iOS 9 phone. p  pAdditional wrinkle of weirdness if back in xcode7 compiling live to iOS9 device again I start scrolling vertically from one of the other cells and the table is still gliding to a stop THEN I CAN drag up and down from the codeUIScrollViewcode. What the heckp  pAnything obvious jump out herep  pThanks,p  pBillp
Positive 24384 pI have an codeUIScrollViewcode with some codeUITextFieldscode in it.

Positive 24384 pI have a codeUIImageViewcode inside a codeUIScrollViewcode and I would like the user to be able to zoom in on the image. So far, the zooming works, but I began noticing some extra space in the scroll views codecontentSpacecode. Initially, I thought this was due to codecontentOffsetcode issues or the like, but after debugging I discovered that aspect ratio of the image view changes after zooming. Initially, the image view fits the image, but, after zooming, the aspect ratio of the image view becomes square. Since the viewed image is rectangular, there is some extra space in the image view. How can this be fixed p

Positive 24384 pI have a list or records containing images and text and I would like the user browse these records as on the Flipboard app, that is with a halfapagestyle transition. So I created a new UIViewController on my storyboard and called it Form view. Its main view contains one single UIScrollView displaying a single record, with images and text. The scrollView scrolls vertically only and it works well. To flip to the nextprevious record I actually use my interactive and custom transition which works pretty well too. The problem is that, in order to display the next record using my transition, I am forced to instantiate a copy of the Form View controller from the storyboard then to push it. So I end up with a bunch of unwanted extra UIViewControllers in the stack. Worst, the leftBarButtonItem reports the name Form view and not Record List as I should really come from. Removing the extra controller when the animation has done, creates some unexpected troubles.p  pSo my question is Can I use an interactive custom transition without using an extra viewController Heres my codep  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      self.animator  [MyFlipPageAnimator new]      UIPanGestureRecognizer  pan  [[UIPanGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTargetself actionselectorPanToFlipPage]     pan.cancelsTouchesInView  NO     pan.delaysTouchesEnded  NO     [self.view addGestureRecognizerpan]     voidPanToFlipPageUIPanGestureRecognizerrecognizer         switchrecognizer.state              case UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan                       ifmTurnPage return              CGPoint velocity  [recognizer velocityInViewview]             mPanHorizontal  fabsvelocity.x gt fabsvelocity.y             ifmPanHorizontal  NO return              self.animator.reverse  location.x gt midWidth ampamp velocity.x lt 0             NSInteger   increment  self.animator.reverse  1  1             NSInteger   newIndex  self.mCurrentRecord  increment              MyFormViewController   extraViewController  [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierFormView]             [extraViewController setRecordsself.records showRecordIndexrecIndex]             self.interactionController  [UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition new]            [self.navigationController pushViewController extraViewController animatedYES]              break        case UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged           ifmTurnPage return           CGPoint translation  [recognizer translationInViewview]           CGFloat d  fabstranslation.x  150           [self.interactionController updateInteractiveTransitiond]       break        case UIGestureRecognizerStateCancelled       case UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded           CGFloat donePercent  self.interactionController.percentComplete           CGPoint velocity  [recognizer velocityInViewview]            BOOL    sameDirection  mVelocityStart.x gt 0 ampamp velocity.x gt 0  mVelocityStart.x lt 0 ampamp velocity.x lt 0           BOOL    finish  donePercent gt 0.5  sameDirection ampamp fabsvelocity.x gt 200            iffinish [self.interactionController finishInteractiveTransition]           else [self.interactionController cancelInteractiveTransition]            self.interactionController  nil           mTurnPage  NO         BOOLgestureRecognizerUIGestureRecognizer gestureRecognizer shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWithGestureRecognizerUIGestureRecognizerotherGestureRecognizer         return mPanHorizontal  NO    id ltUIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioninggtnavigationControllerUINavigationController navigationController                                animationControllerForOperationUINavigationControllerOperationoperation                                             fromViewControllerUIViewController fromVC                                               toViewControllerUIViewController toVC         ifmTurnPage        if operation  UINavigationControllerOperationPop  operation  UINavigationControllerOperationPush            return self.animator                  return nil            else return nil    id ltUIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioninggtnavigationControllerUINavigationController navigationController                       interactionControllerForAnimationControllerid ltUIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioninggt animationController       ifmTurnPage              return self.interactionController          else return nil  codepre

Positive 24384 pIm still learning to develop in iOS and Swift so I apologize beforehand if my question is too simple.p  pI have created an UICollectionViewController to show a matrix of elements. My issue is that the width of the screen is not wide enough to fit all the columns in a single row, so the excess of them are shown in another row below. Instead of this, Id like to enable the horizontal scroll so the user can scroll to see all the columns in one single row.p  pI know UICollectionViewController already contains UIScrollView so I guess this should be as simple as to change a setting in the .storyboard but I couldnt find it after many trialerrors p  pI guess it is related to the Flow layouts setting and that I need to handle a custom one, but dont know how exactly.p  pWould anyone be so kind to please help me I havent attached any code because Im using a pretty standardoutofthebox implementation of UICollectionViewController but if you want me to add anything, just let me know, please.p  pMany thanks in advance for any helpp

Im trying it the way outlined a hrefhttpwww.apeth.comiOSBookch20.html relnofollowherea on apeth.com as was referenced on another SO question. My implementation does not set a contentSize or use a contentView as the scrollView should adjust to the size of its subviews. p  pThe problem is that the UIButtons and UILabels seem to not have the constraints applied. I had to bunch up my UIButtons and UILabels to fit on the Storyboard so I could see them like so.

Positive 24384 pI have a codeUIScrollViewcode in each codeUITableViewCellcode of my table view that lays out codeUIViewscode horizontally  kind of like the Featured section on Apples App Store. When Im setting up the codeUITableViewCellcode I call a function within the custom codeUITableViewCellcode to layout the scroll view. This loops through data assigned to that tableview cells index path and then creates the custom views and adds them to the scroll view. However, these get mixed up when scrolling the tableview and when the tableview refreshes.p  pIf I clear the subviews before laying them out, it does work. However, Id like to keep the scroll position at the same point every time it shows the cells. How is this possiblep
Positive 24384 pI am having trouble using UIScrollView with Autolayout with the resulting layout being able to be localized. p  pIn the normal examples, we are told to embed a contentView of type UIView of into the UIScrollview with its sides pinned to the 4 sides of the scrollview. The contentView must have explicit size, and subviews of this contentView will be pinned and sized accordingly. Easy enough.p  pHowever, this doesnt take into account localization. Apples guidelines for localization state that UILabels and other string holding UIView types should not have an explicit width to account for content length. If UILabel subviews of the contentView are not given explicit widths, then the contentView also cannot have explicit width. How can the need for explicit size in the contentView to make scrollView work be reconciled with the need for flexible sizing for localizationp

Positive 24384 pIve implemented a UIScrollView within a UITableViewCell that enables the user to scroll left and right to reveal buttons in the same fashion as the iOS Mail app. The original implementation that set frames and positions explicitly worked well but Ive refactored the code to use autolayout throughout. Animation to hidereveal the container for the buttons on the left accessory buttons works well but the animation that brings the scrollview to rest when the right container edit buttons slows just before reaching the desired offset before jerking into its final position.p  pAll calculations use the same math just transformed e.g.  rather than  value,  rather than lt in tests depending on the side the container is located and the values displayed by logging are correct. I cant see any obvious code errors and there are no constraints for the cells set up in IB. Is this a bug or is there something obvious Ive missed through staring at the code for the last hourp  precodeclass SwipeyTableViewCell UITableViewCell        MARK Constants     private let

Ive chosen to go with an MD5 hash and it fits fine for my purpose. The uniqueness is an important issue, but I dont expect the number of those hashes to be very large at any given time  these hashes represent software servers on a home LAN, so at max there would be 5, maybe 10 running.p
Negative 24384 pIm looking for the fastest way to determine if a codelongcode value is a perfect square i.e. its square root is another integer.  Ive done it the easy way, by using the builtin Math.sqrt function, but Im wondering if there is a way to do it faster by restricting yourself to integeronly domain.  Maintaining a lookup table is impratical since there are about 2sup31.5sup integers whose square is less than 2sup63sup.p  pHere is the very simple and straightforward way Im doing it nowp  precodepublic final static boolean isPerfectSquarelong n    if n lt 0     return false    long tst  longMath.sqrtn  0.5   return tsttst  n  codepre  hr  piNotes Im using this function in many a hrefhttpprojecteuler.netProject Eulera problems.  So no one else will ever have to maintain this code.  And this kind of microoptimization could actually make a difference, since part of the challenge is to do every algorithm in less than a minute, and this function will need to be called millions of times in some problems.ip  hr  pstrongUpdate 2strong  A new solution posted by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers3508arexA. Rexa has proven to be even faster.  In a run over the first 1 billion integers, the solution only required 34 of the time that the original solution used.

However, as suggested by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers38426bobbyshaftoeBobbyShaftoea, we can use the Carmack hack for n lt 410881.li liNewtons method was a good bit slower than codeMath.sqrtcode.  This is probably because codeMath.sqrtcode uses something similar to Newtons Method, but implemented in the hardware so its much faster than in Java.  Also, Newtons Method still required use of doubles.li liA modified Newtons method, which used a few tricks so that only integer math was involved, required some hacks to avoid overflow I want this function to work with all positive 64bit signed integers, and it was still slower than codeMath.sqrtcode.li liBinary chop was even slower.  This makes sense because the binary chop will on average require 16 passes to find the square root of a 64bit number.li ul  pThe one suggestion which did show improvements was made by a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers25188johndcookJohn D. Cooka.  You can observe that the last hex digit i.e. the last 4 bits of a perfect square must be 0, 1, 4, or 9.  This means that 75 of numbers can be immediately eliminated as possible squares.  Implementing this solution resulted in about a 50 reduction in runtime.p  pWorking from Johns suggestion, I investigated properties of the last emnem bits of a perfect square.  By analyzing the last 6 bits, I found that only 12 out of 64 values are possible for the last 6 bits.  This means 81 of values can be eliminated without using any math.  Implementing this solution gave an additional 8 reduction in runtime compared to my original algorithm.  Analyzing more than 6 bits results in a list of possible ending bits which is too large to be practical.p  pHere is the code that I have used, which runs in 42 of the time required by the original algorithm based on a run over the first 100 million integers.  For values of emnem less than 410881, it runs in only 29 of the time required by the original algorithm.p  precodeprivate final static boolean isPerfectSquarelong n    if n lt 0     return false    switchintn amp 0x3F      case 0x00 case 0x01 case 0x04 case 0x09 case 0x10 case 0x11   case 0x19 case 0x21 case 0x24 case 0x29 case 0x31 case 0x39     long sqrt     ifn lt 410881L            John Carmack hack, converted to Java.

Negative 24384 pUPDATE So pretty much everyone here told me that i just need to start over again on how i designed my classes thank you folks for your excellent answers by the way.  Taking the hint, i started doing extensive reading on the a hrefhttpwww.dofactory.comPatternsPatternStrategy.aspx relnofollowstrategy patterna.  I want to create behavior classes or strategy classes that inherit from an abstract base classes.  The Candidate class would then have properties w the different abstract base classes as the types for the behaviors or strategies.  maybe something like thisp  precodepublic abstract class SalaryStrategy      public abstract decimal Salary  get set      public abstract decimal Min  get set      public abstract decimal Mid  get set      public decimal CompaRatio          get              if this.Mid  0  return 0              else  return this.Salary  this.Mid                  public class InternalCurrentSalaryStrategy      public override decimal Salary  get set      public override decimal Min          get  return this.Salary  .25m          set            public override decimal Mid  get set    public class Candidate      public int Id  get set      public string Name  get set      public SalaryStrategy CurrentSalaryStrategy  get set    public static void Mainstring[] args      var internal  new Candidate     internal.CurrentSalaryStrategy  new InternalCurrentSalaryStrategy     var internalElp  new Candidate     internalElp.CurrentSalaryStrategy  new InternalCurrentSalaryStrategy     var elp  new Candidate      elp.CurrentSalaryStrategy can stay null cause its not used for elps  codepre  pAny comments or suggestionsp  phr p  pORIGINAL Questionp  pI am trying to learn and become more proficient at design patterns and principles.

Heres a very condensed version of the codep  precodepublic class Candidate      public int Id  get set      public string Comments  get set       lots more properties and behaviors...   public class InternalCandidate  Candidate      public decimal CurrentMid  get set      public decimal CurrentMax           get  return this.CurrentMin  1.3m           lots more properties and behaviors...   public class EntryLevelCandidate  Candidate      public string Gpa  get set       lots more properties and behaviors...   public class InternalEntryLevelCandidate  what do I inherit here        needs all of the properties and behaviors of      EntryLevelCandidate but also needs the CurrentMin and      CurrentMax and possibly more in InternalCandidate  codepre  pThe InternalEntryLevelCandidate class is primarily an EntryLevelCandidate but needs to share some of the emimplementationsem of InternalCandidate.  I say implementations because I dont want the implementations to be different or repeated, otherwise I would use an interface for common contracts and have concrete implementations in each class.  Some of the implementations of the InternalCandidate properties and behaviors need to be common or shared.  I have read about C and Ruby mixins, which seem to be something similar to what I what I want to do.  I also read this interesting blog post that discusses an idea for a behavior type where a class would be able to inherit multiple behaviors while still maintaining a single is a relationship a hrefhttpwww.deftflux.netblogpostAgooddesignformultipleimplementationinheritance.aspx relnofollowhttpwww.deftflux.netblogpostAgooddesignformultipleimplementationinheritance.aspxa.

Negative 24384 pI have a slightly unique requirement with the JavaJDBC API along with Oracle Database. I have autoCommit to be default which is true for Oracle and I am using the example similar to this a hrefhttpwww.exampledepot.comegsjava.sqlBatchUpdate.htmllinka.p  pHowever, when I add say 1000 batches and lets say each of them are inserts. And Let us assume that about 20 records violated some constraints, I want the remaining 980 to go COMMITTED and henceforth visible to any other queries using any other connection to the database and ignore the 20 records. In the above example, when one row violates any transaction then strongeven when I commit in the catch block the transaction only commits until the first failurestrong.p  pI know batch updates are to be done ONLY when you are fairly sure all rows will go through and exception processing is not one, but am planning to PATCH an existing database so some kind of bad practices is okay  Any code samples will be highly appreciated. p  pstrong MORE DETAILS strongp  pUsing Simple insertupdate is not okay since I am processing close to 3M rows so am batching every 1000 records. Simply adding 1000 inserts in loop ignoring exceptions takes way more time about 5 seconds for every 1000 records as opposed to the batch update lt 300ms.p  pProblem With Oracle database the Driver seems to stop at the first FAILURE, ie when 1000 rows are batched and 100th failed, I want it to go ahead till the 1000th row. Me thinks this cannot be done in JDBC with Oracle Like the a hrefhttpwww.exampledepot.comegsjava.sqlBatchUpdate.htmllinka indicates only few databases support such feature and probably Oracle is not one p

Negative 24384 pI have a threaded console application that is working fine, but its architecture needs to be improved, and Id like some feedback.p  pCurrently, the program loads up a list of data, and segments that data into partitions one chunk for each thread.  The program then initializes a new thread using the ThreadPool, and passes it ONE segment of the partitioned data on which to operate.p  pEverything works nicely...exceptp  pSome of the threads fail...due to network problems, or unrecoverable exceptions.  This is expected behavior and not a bug.p  pI now need a way if the thread fails to recover that threads segment of data and provide it to another working thread so that it doesnt become orphaned.  Im sure there are ways to do this, ie, sharing data between threads, etc, but I think theres a better approach.p  pInstead of segmenting the data beforehand and passing it to each thread, I could share ONE static collection of this data between all threads.  This is more elegant, but introduces newfound sync problems that the old approach didnt have to worry about.p  pA. What are your thoughts on this approach vs the old onebr B. If this approach is a good one, how do I go about locking access to the shared static collection.p  pWhen the thread inits, I can lock the collection and popoff a segment of the data just for that thread.  The static collection would now be REDUCED by the amount popped off for that thread.  Upon FAILURE of the thread, I could reallocate that segment of data to the shared collection by again locking it, and pushing the data back to the collection for other threads to attempt to process.p  pFor example untested pseudocodep  precodevoid Processobject threadInfo    lockStaticCollection        var segment  StaticCollection.Take100     StaticCollection.RemoveStaticCollection.Whereitem gt segment.Containsitem       foreachvar seg in segment         do something        reallocate the threads data on failure   ifunrecoverableErrorOccurred        lockStaticCollection            StaticCollection.Addsegment          codepre  pAm I on the right track with this  It seems to me that one thread can remove items at the same time another thread is reallocating items...or does a lock on a STATIC collection mean that no other thread can access that collection at all.  So, Thread A. obtained a lock in the FIRST part of the method, would that block all other threads from executing the LAST part of the method until ThreadA was completep

Negative 24384 pI have a slightly unusual situation where Im needing to maintain CLIENT tcp connections to another server for thousands of mobile users on my servers basically the mobile devices connect to my middle tier server when they are able to, which maintains a more stable connection to the 3rd party server for the mobile devices.p  pAnyways, Ive developed my server application using Async Sockets wrapped up in a SslStream, and have got 1000 client sessions running full time on it right now.  Im quite happy with the results so far as Im seeing about 010 average cpu usage on a single core processor, and about 60mb of ram being used over time.p  pMy question is, how do I scale this up so I can reach 100,000 or 200,000 or more client sessions being run on my server  Again, this is a bit untraditional, as my server isnt really acting like a server, since Im worried about outgoing connections, not incoming.p  pI know that theres a registry setting MaxUserPort that needs to be changed to get beyond the default which seems to be 5000.  However, there seems to be another hard limit of 65535, and Im not too clear on where that limit resides. Is this a limit per network interface  Is it a global Windows limit Is it a limit per process p  pIf it is a limit per network interface, can I add multiple network interfaces and bind client session sockets to each interface eg 65k on interface 1, 65k on interface 2, etc.p  pIm also not too sure what, if any socket options or properties I should be setting to help things out.  Right now Im not using any socket options.p  pId really appreciate any thoughts on this subject, as clear advice has been pretty hard to come by on this subject.  Thanksp
Negative 24384 pAll right, after having worked through a hrefhttpcocoadevcentral.comarticles000085.php relnofollowCocoa Dev Centrals Build a Core Data Application tutoriala I started experimenting with building my own application, using the code and code.nibcode file from the tutorial as a reference to make sure that things are put together properly.

All the other controls work properly and saverefresh their values when I go between records minus some date box silliness, where the second box doesnt want to save its values.  I have checked all of the bindings settings and the codeNSArrayControllercode against the code.nibcode from the tutorial to see where things could be off that led to unhooking the first text box and then reconnecting it with the same settings and it suddenly magically working.  The second box doesnt want to behave, however, and persists in breaking the program the debugger shows up, listing all manner of variables and memory addresses and stuff thats frankly quite beyond my comprehension.p  pCurrently, the offending box is configured as followsp  precodeClass NSTextView Value Bound to history     Controller Key selection     Model Key Path description     Checked Allows Editing Multiple Values Selection     Checked Conditionally Sets Editable     Checked Raises For Not Applicable Keys codepre  pAny insight into whats going on herep

My question is, how can I access the image object that was clicked inside the codeenlargeImagecode function  I tried accessing the codethiscode object inside the function hoping it pointed to the image that was clicked, but codethiscode referred to the entire page, not the image that was clicked. Id like to be able access the codesrccode attribute, as well as, change the style attributes of the image thumbnail.  I should also note that eventually there will be multiple images which is why I need this dynamic behavior.p  pThanks so much in advance for your helpp
Negative 24384 pI am writing a small application in C using a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiWindowsForms relnofollowWindows Formsa. I want to let my users copy and paste data around the application and there are some custom controls, for example one is a colour picker.p  pSome of the default controls well at least the TextBox have a copy and paste functionality already. I want to have the same thing with my colour picker, and also want an Edit menu at the top to copy and paste.p  pAt the moment, I cant see how to do this in a nice way, my current tack is to catch the kbdCtrlkbd  kbdCkbd and kbdCtrlkbd  kbdVkbd commands and the menu clicks and go through a function which uses some a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiWindowsAPI relnofollowWin32a calls to find the focused control and then copy or paste data from or to the control with a massive codeifcode statement depending on the type of the focused control.p  pThe alternative seems to be to write key handling into every custom control, but with this method Im not sure how to incorporate the Edit menu functions.p  pHow do I do this in an elegant or more standard wayp

Really it is just a gui for editing these files as they have a special format.

Except all other files will have Build Action set to None except the .inf file which will always have Build Action set to Resource...and this causes it to not be copied to the output directory as far as I can tell. p  pI think I must be missing something here, as it seems VS is doing this on purpose, so perhaps I am not following best practice each time I change its build action back to none  to have it copied to the output directory just like all the other files.p  pThanks.p

Negative 24384 pAll, p  pWondering if someone could help.  Ive been using DataTables quite some time both via dom manipulation and JSON code.  However, two of our larger resultsets are still running too slow, so Im attempting to convert them over to clientside data sources.  I have the table there, with headers, but the data is not being injected into the markup.p  pIve built the output page and copied a snippet of the output from that code for reference.  It is validating via JSON validator and I can see no differences between it and the example code.  In fact, at one point I tried using the example data on my site to get this working to no avail.  Not that it matters, but my JSON is created via a Symfony action which is able to be directly accessed with login, of course  I can successfully see the validated JSON output on Firebug via XHR call so I know its available at runtime to the browser.  I have had other datatables running in this page, so the includes are properly setup.  My theory is that something related to instantiation, be it a malformed parameter or a missing command, that is causing this to fail without error.  p  pThe following is my codep  pAJAX page output truncated for clarity purposes  p  precodesEcho 0, iTotalRecords 1788, iTotalDisplayRecords 1788, aaData[[, lta hrefweblink123gtltimg border0 altView Prospect srcwebimagesview.png gtltagt, First, Last, company , address, city, state, ] ,[, lta hrefweblink124gtltimg border0 altView Prospect srcwebimagesview.png gtltagt, first1, last1, company1, address1, city1, state1, email1] ] codepre  pJquery Initializationp  precodejQueryprospectList.dataTable           bProcessing true,          bServerSide true,          sAjaxSource webprospectajax,          bJQueryUI true,          sPaginationType fullnumbers,          bAutoWidth false,          bFiltertrue,          bLengthChange true,          bPaginate true,          bSort true,          iDisplayLength 10,          bInfo true,          aoColumns [              sTitle Action ,              sTitle First Name ,              sTitle Last Name ,              sTitle Company ,              sTitle Street,              sTitle City ,              sTitle State ,              sTitle Email           ]        codepre  pAnybody see anything missing  Thanks in advance.p

Negative 24384 pIm writing a .net WCF service.  Ive written a few classes that I want to return to the calling code from the WCF service hence, I decorate them with the codeDataContractcode attribute.p  pLets suppose that my WCF service is called codeFooServicecode.  It contains a method called codeFooMethodcode which returns an object of type codeFooDatacode which is decorated with the codeDataContractcode attribute.  Suppose that codeFooDatacode contains a list of numbers and a method called codeFooAveragecode which returns the average value of the numbers.p  pIn Visual Studio, I create a new application to consume the service.  I add a new Service Reference to my WCF Service and give it the namespace codemyWcfServicecode.  In my client code, I instantiate a proxy class and get a connection to the service.  To get the codeFooDatacode object from my proxy, the method call is codemyWcfService.FooMethodcode.  It returns an object of type codemyWcfService.FooDatacode, which is a type determined from the codeFooServicecode metadata.p  pNow that I have my object of type codemyWcfService.FooDatacode, how can I get this data into an object of type codeFooDatacode as the original type from the service code so that I can call codeFooData.FooAveragecodep  pbEditb I am entirely aware of the fact that data comes down the pipe in XML format and that the logic of the methods in a class decorated with codeDataContractcode does not get returned by the service it isnt serializable.  What Im asking is if I can reference the class that contains the codeDataContractcode class used in the service, is there a straightforward way to deserialize the data into the class that it was serialized fromp  pI am willing to accept the answer that it is not possible with the current .net framework.p
Negative 24384 pI apologize if this is a duplicate but I couldnt find any solutions that worked or any symptoms identical to mine.p  pI have a VSTO Word AddIn Ive been developing for awhile.  Ive never changed Visual Studios 2010 Solution Configuration before Ive just left it as Debug.  But today my AddIn has stopped loading in Word.  It appears in the list of Word COM addins the list you get when you open word, go to Word Options  AddIns, but the checkmark is off, and when I turn the checkmark on and return to that list of COM addins, its off again.  Also the message for the AddIn in Words list of AddIns is just Unloaded not anything like Unloaded an error occurred while...  Cleaning and rebuilding doesnt help.  Deleting its registry node in HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftOfficeWordAddIns doesnt help.  Removing the AddIn from Words list of AddIns doesnt help.  Im stumped.p  pThe only clues I have as to what is going on are 1 there is no output from my BuildRun when I am in Debug configuration.  The Output window of Visual Studio is just blank.  2 When I switch to Release configuration in Visual Studio, my buildrun now results in output in the output window and the addin loads properly in word.  I feel like this information might help someone more knowledgeable than I about WordVSTOVisual Studio.p  pHelp  Thank you.p

Negative 24384 pI come up against this decision frequently and I constantly vacillate on what approach to take.p  pMany MVVM examples have the model being passed into the constructor of the view model. Hence every VM is coupled to a Model. The logic to retrieve the Model and create the VM is outside of the VM somewhere. Model has to know how to persist it changes.p  pThe other option is to pass some sort of context, service or repository through to the VM and the VM decides what model it needs. The implication is the VM has a longer lifetime and might be reused to display many different models. The VM will commit changes to the model back using  the supplied service.p  pHas anyone come up with any rules for working out the best approach for a given scenariop

Negative 24384 pIm currently building my first JSF 2 application and I have some questions regarding flow of data between views.p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pThe application keeps track of competences of ITconsultants. To illustrate my questions, I will just describe a small part of it. A Competence entity has a manytoone relation to a Area entity, putting the different competences in groups. I have views to handle these emCompetence.xhtmlem, emEditCompetence.xhtmlem and emEditCompetenceArea.xhtmlem. These are backed up by a ManagedBean, emAdminCompetenceControllerem. p  pemCompetence.xhtmlem lists all Areas in a table, and lists all Competences in an Area if the user clicks on its row. It also has a newbutton for Competences and Areas, and an Editbutton for each Competence and Area. these leads to emEditCompetence.xhtmlem and emEditCompetenceArea.xhtmlem respectivly, where the user can fill in information about a Competence or and Area.p  pstrongQuestionsstrongp  ul lipWhat is the recommended way to handle flow of information between these pages For example emEditCompetenceArea.xhtmlem needs to know which Area it should edit or if it should make a new one. Should I have one backing bean per view or one for all of them Should it be Session scoped and keep track of the selected AreaCompetence with variables Or should it be View scoped and send the id of the selected object with viewParams Is it even possible to use Request scope Ive tried several of these and have run into practical problems with each method.pli lipIs it possible to use viewParam to transfer information between views using different backing beanspli liIs it possible to use viewParam with a Request scoped backing bean The data seems to disappear from the bean before I can use it in the postback.li ul  pAlso, if anyone can recommend any reading material preferably free, online regarding more general design patterns rather than specific smaller problems in strongJSF 2strong, I would really appreciate it.p

or y axisli lii use or dont use the GL10glEnableGL10.GLDEPTHTEST command in the method onSurfaceCreatedli ul  pSo, what is the simplest way to correct that  I have thought of using glClearDepth and

Negative 24384 pIn this art website Im working on for a school project, I am using Joomla 1.5 as the CMS of choice and JoomGallery to display artworks. emI tried to install 1.6 several times, but the Next buttons would not work for me for some reason. I installed it manually, but had another issue, so finally reverted to 1.5... and then I realized that the other issue was easily fixed. Ill migrate it to 1.6 eventually, but not now.emp  pOn the website, there are three primary categories of art, all of which appear in the menuTraditional, Digital, and Photography. Each one is linked to a respective category in JoomGallery, each with its own subcategories.p  pWhat I want in this case is that each one is locked within its own boundaries, essentially. However, when clicking on the Last Added and Most Viewed links, images are taken from EVERY SINGLE category I have created and is published, not just the current root category I set for the page and its subcategories. Additionally, Id like total number of hits and total images to be restricted to that specific category and its subcategories.p  pI searched around and I could not find a way to fix this. Im sure theres a way, but Im not too keen on Joomla yet... Ive tried looking into it and I cant figure out. I just naturally assumed that this would be pretty obviousif I set a category in a Menu Page, all the links and everything would be restricted to that single category, but its not the case, and I dont like it.p  pI know theres got to be a way to do this, but again, Im really not into Joomla much yet. I managed to build the template from scratch with a tiny bit of help from tutorials, but I havent started getting into other Extensions yet. How can I go about accomplishing this task which should have been an option to begin withp  pBelow is a link to the website. Again, the pages Im referring to are Traditional, Digital, and Photography. The categories are locked down pretty good cant view any higherother categories, but the TOP links dont restrict it by category, and neither do the total number of hitsimages.p  pa hrefhttpaeternalwings.tsronline.org relnofollowhttpaeternalwings.tsronline.orgap  pAnd no, I dont hate JoomGallery... in fact, its the best free Open Source Joomla Gallery Ive found, and I doubt Ill find a better one without having to pay an arm and a leg. Its mainly this one thing thats bothering me.p  pemP.S. The artwork on this site is not mine, but I DO have permission to use it. This website is for my fiance, and all artwork was drawn by her, and all photos were taken by her except for perhaps the selfportrait displayed on the Blog page. It was built during a school assignment, and she will later use it once it is complete.emp

Negative 24384 pMy question is really innocent. Ive been reading up on git, and I already know the basics like pushing and pulling and creating branches and so on. My mentor told me that the proper way to work with git is to pull the resources, create a new local branch, transfer and edit that local branch and once youre done, go back to master branch and merge it with your local branch. Now my question is, what exactly happens behind the scene p  ol lipI mean, when git creates a local branch, does it create a copy of the master branch that you can edit If it does, where are these copies located pli lipIf by any chance I mess up on my local branch, how do I revert back the changeslets say for example, I want to go back to the way it was when I pulled the master Is it just a simple matter of going back to master and deleting the local branchpli lipI suppose that the reason why people call it version control is because of the branches, which I think...Represents the version. Am I correct pli lipWhy is the master called a branch Shouldnt it be a trunk emokay that just a very dumb question, ignore 4...em hahahapli ol  pAnswers to my innocent childlike questions shall be appreciated. lt3 lt3 lt3p

Negative 24384 pIs there a way to automate or at least automate some of the process of extracting data from forms that is stored in the codePOSTcode or codeGETcode superglobalsp  pI know you can iterate through the array with a foreach loop and other kinds of loops to do something with each keyvalue pair, but there are many times where I have other code that needs that data but just wont work when inside a foreach loop at all.p  pEDIT Heres an example I can think of. Say I have a whole bunch of posted data and want to insert it into a database. As far as I can see, doing something like this isnt possible since Id need to insert a value into a different column on each loop throughp  precodeforeacharray as key gt value  mysqlqueryINSERT INTO table somecolumn VALUESvalue  codepre  pAlso, another thing Id really like to do is take all of the values from the posted data and assign each of them to a variable somehow kind of like what codeextractcode does but without the issue of overwriting other variables. The only thing I can think of to handle this is to somehow put the data into an array, but Im not sure if this much much more efficientp  precodedata  array foreacharray as key gt value  data[key]  value  codepre  pOne last case I can think of is when I have to use this data outside of the foreach loop. If I modify my code to have it so that everything is executed inside of the foreach loop, then I am restricted to keeping everything that has to do with the form data inside of the loop. If variables andor constants are defined inside of a loop, they cant be accessed outside of it, correct I have been working with Java a lot lately and am used to the more strict scope and strict way of handling variables  p  pIve been reading about the codeextractcode method a bit, but it looks like a bit of a dangerous thing to use overwriting variables, security holes, etc.p  pFor anyone else that processes large amounts of data lets say 25 form fields, how do you do it Im tired of assigning variables like codedata  POST[somedata]code over and over to use them elsewhere...p  pThanksp

Negative 24384 pI had a few questions all related to the way an entity manager is created and used in an application with respect to codeVirtual Private Databasescode, which is a feature in Oracle DB which enables Row Level Security.p  ol lipIn a session bean, we generally have the entity manager as a member, and its generally injected by the container. How is this entity manager managed by the container  I mean, if we want to implement a codeVirtual Private Databasecode then we have to make sure that the codeVirtual Private Databasecodecontext remains valid for the entire user session, and we do not have to set this context everytime before we fire a query. to include more verbiage here  a session bean implements a couple of functions and each of these functions uses the same entity manager now, it should not be the case that we set the Virtual Private Database everytime in each of these functions which do some DB manipulations.pli lipFurther to 1, since the entity manager is cached in the session bean, do we need to explicitly close the entity manager in any scenario like we do for JDBC connectionspli lipAlso, I was wondering what should be the use caseor design criteria for using a JTA or a nonJTA datasource. Is the way we create an entity manager dependant on thispli ol  pTo add w.r.t the requirement on VPD  It would be nice if the container managed EM can somehow be made to enforce the VPD per user. Note that EM is injected in here, so there should be a mechanism to set the VPD on the connectionand later retrieve the same connection for this user in this session. p  pWithout an injected EM, i think using a reference to EMF and then setting the properties for the EM can be done. Something like  org.eclipse.persistence.internal.jpa.EntityManagerImplem.getDelegate.setPropertiesp  pIt would be an overkill, if the VPD is set everytime before the query is fired, rather the connection should maintain the VPD context during the users session and later release the connection after clearing the VPD back to the pool.p

The animation is then stopped in the viewDidLoad method of the tableview controller. Initially, I just stuck the code to start the animation above the lines of code that start the modal view. What happened was the animation was never played. p  precode[[self loadingView] playAnimation]  SettingsViewController menus  [[SettingsViewController alloc] initWithNibNameSettingsViewController bundlenil]  MyNavigationController navController  [[MyNavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewControllermenus]  [menus setParentnavController] [navController setDelegateself] menus.mainViewController  self  [self presentModalViewControllernavController animatedYES] [navController release] [menus release] codepre  pI then tried the following, and it worked...p  precode[NSThread detachNewThreadSelectorselectorsettingsOpeningThread toTargetself withObjectnil] [[self loadingView] playAnimation]     void settingsOpeningThread   NSAutoreleasePool apool  [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init]  SettingsViewController menus  [[SettingsViewController alloc]   initWithNibNameSettingsViewController bundlenil]  MyNavigationController navController  [[MyNavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewControllermenus]  [menus setParentnavController] [navController setDelegateself] menus.mainViewController  self  [self presentModalViewControllernavController animatedYES] [navController release] [menus release]  [apool release]   codepre  pAnimation keeps playing until the SettingsViewController view is fully launched. But does launching modal views like this count as UI and should be avoided Also I am getting some weird memory leak errors in Instruments every time the modal view is launched. But its from one of those System Libraries, which Ive been told is very difficult to debug. What might be going wrong herep  pSorry for the embarrassingly long post. Any help will be appreciatedp

Negative 24384 pThe 1,500 page Access 97 Bible dont laugh that Ive been given by my boss to solve his problem doesnt solve my problem of how to solve his problem, because it has nee VBA code.p  pLet me first make clear that Ive made attempts to solve this without much coding, and that Ive coded quite a bit in VBA already, so Im basically familiar with most things including recordsets, queries, etc etc but have problems with MS Access limits on how to form a report with data coming from VBA variables. Im also versatile in most programming languages, but this is not a language problem but rather a how towhats possible problem.p  pMy problem right now is that dragging the query fields into the Detail subform and putting them into cells in columns setting Left and Top with VBA code are moving them alright, but each cell is on a new page. Unfortunately, there is multiple data in each cell that wont conform to the Create Report Guide options available.p  pSo my question is simply this strongCan someone point me to working examples of code that create, place, and fill with VBA variable strings, text fields at any coordinate I please on a paper size of my choicestrongp  pEdit The above is not an option, as I understand this will prohibit the client from getting an .mde database. What remains, then, is to merely ask for some sound advice on how to get several rows GROUPed BY weekday and machine see below into a recordset or similar for each cell. I guess the best way is to count the number of columns in the table machines in the sql result and create 5 rows of these with dummy data, then go through the result rows and place the data in the relevant controls. But if you have ideas for doing this work better and faster, write them as answers.p  pSorry for this, I knew there was something I wasnt understanding. Basically, I thought Access supported creating reports dynamically via VBA, ie. generating pages with data rather than preparing a flow of controls connected to datasources. But Access requires that you create an ample amount of dummy, unlinked controls manually, then either fill or hide them and thats how they become dynamic.p  pThis is for Access 2003 on a remote server accessing local and remote ODBC SQL database tables, if relevant. strongThe goal is to make a week schedule of n columns nnumber of machines at a certain plant x 5 rows weekday MonFri, and put 1 or more recordset rows scheduled activities for that day on that machine in each of the n by 5 table cells.strongp  pIf you detect venting frustration in this post I can only ask your forgiveness and hope for your understanding.p

Negative 24384 pOk, this might not be possible, but Ive got a class called codeCompositeViewcode thats a subclasses codeUIViewcode.  It uses some core graphics work to produce a custom background based on some options.  Not a huge class, but bound to grow as my demands changeincreasewhatever.  The problem Im having is I use this class a lot, in a lot of different places.  But in a few of the places I need it to be a subclass of codeUIScrollViewcode instead of a codeUIViewcode.  Interestingly enough, I can simply change the superclass and it all works perfectly fine.  But not only do I not want all my other views to be a codeUIScrollViewcode, it also interferes with the operation of some of them.  So I need a class thats sometimes a subclass of codeUIScrollViewcode and sometimes a subclass of codeUIViewcode.p  pFor now, Ive literally copied all of the interfaceimplementation of the codeCompositeViewcode, changed the class name to codeCompositeScrollViewcode, and changed its inheritance to codeUIScrollViewcode.  It works fine, but now Ive got two sets of code that do exactly the same thing, just inherited from different parent classes.  This makes keeping them both up to date a pain.p  pIs there a better way to do thisp

Negative 24384 pThis question has been repeatedly asked and answered with oneline assertions, such as because it is an obvious violation of MVC.  Frankly, I just dont get it.  Indeed, it feels to me that putting session inside the controller merely an artifact that ApplicationController faces the network layer via a rack call, rather than an MVC mandate.  Let me explain my problem.p  pRolling an authentication from scratch, I found myself agonizing and spiking all over the place for lack of ability to articulate simple tests session isnt available to the testing framework either.  My authentication scheme, as almost all I have seen in rails, wanted to use the session hash as a persistence layer to retain the id for the User model of the current user.  Doesnt that feel FAR MORE like a model than a controller artifactp  pThe code smells are obvious whenever you look at the typical sessions controller this one from Ryan Bates excellent screencasts.  Desperate to shovel this concept in with rest, we see unhealthy language such asp  precodedef create    user  User.findbyemailparams[session][email]   if user ampamp user.authenticateparams[session][password]     session[userid]  user.id     redirectto rooturl, notice Logged in   else     flash.now.alert  Email or password is invalid     render new   end end codepre  pTo me, this is a code smell, an obviously overlogicked controller that is screaming for refactoring  But we cant.  Why  Oh yes, because it is a violation of MVC to put references to the session, used as a persistence lawyer into the model.  WTF  Doesnt it say something to you that we seem to want to CALL THIS REST RESOURCE sessionsp  pTo see why this is just plain screwy, look at your login views  handcoded html, or use of the tags API  If we had an ActiveModel model to do this code, then the create code could look like the usual scaffolding, or possibly even reduced to the respondwith oneliner.p  precodedef create    recognition  Recognition.newparams[user]   if recognition.save     redirectto rooturl, notice gt Thank you for signing up   else     render new   end end codepre  pThen, take a look at the handcoded html for all of those views  If Recognition was a model, persisted by session or some other means that should not be the responsibility of the controller layer anyway, then you could simple use form builder or simpleform to generate the forms.  Of course, we could simply pass the session hash to a newlogin class method of Recognition, say codeRecognition.onsession.newparams[recognition]code, but that seems uglier than it has to be.  Perhaps it is inherent, as we will want to use a currentuser reference later in the application layer, perhaps codeRecognition.onsession.currentusercode similar to the way one might use a singleton patternp  pJust try to build your authentication package with strict BDD, and honestly tell me you havent spiked this portion of it  If we had a Recognition model, this entire thing would be reduced to a simple set of unit tests without hackery.  Now, instead we have the sole use case for integration testing, magic invasions of ActiveController modules and hacks to make speedy any acceptance testing of the loggedinas predicate.p  pI think the entire point of ActiveModel was to facilitate this kind of rethinking and refactoring.  Not all models use the database.  Why not persist to the session  p  pI have been using devise and its kin for too long, burying these smells with the dont mess with the gem excuse I dont have to look at them.  No longer  I think I am going to reject the zealots from now on.  Sorry, to me, session is a persistence layer that should be manipulated in the Model layer of MVC.  I posit, but am not sure, that the reason it lives in controllerland has more to do with the ugly or elegant fact that controllers are rack objects than any theoretical MVC magic.p  pSo once again, is there a more elegant way to access the session layer than to have logic in the controller for thatp

Negative 24384 pThe W3C definition seems a bit vague when it comes to the a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRhtml5sections.htmlthenavelementcodeltnavgtcodea tagp  blockquote   pThe nav element represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page a section with navigation links.p      pNot all groups of links on a page need to be in a nav element  the element is primarily intended for sections that consist of major navigation blocks. In particular, it is common for footers to have a short list of links to various pages of a site, such as the terms of service, the home page, and a copyright page. The footer element alone is sufficient for such cases while a nav element can be used in such cases, it is usually unnecessary.p      pUser agents such as screen readers that are targeted at users who can benefit from navigation information being omitted in the initial rendering, or who can benefit from navigation information being immediately available, can use this element as a way to determine what content on the page to initially skip andor provide on request.p blockquote  pBased on a very strict interpretation of their definition and what Ive encountered through validation, it appears as though codeltnavgtcode should only contain list elements. However, shouldnt search be considered a form of navigation within a series of pages p  pWhile I understand that its primary use is for user agents, it still seems rather redundant to have a codeltnavgtcode preceding a codeltulgtcode tag if the former acts only as a container for the latter. It would make more sense if codeltnavgtcode could contain other elements related to navigation, not limited to a list of links.p  pFor examplep  precodeltnav rolenavigationgt   ltform actionhttpgoogle.comsearch methodgetgt     ltfieldset rolesearchgt        ltinput typehidden nameq valuesitemysite.com gt        ltinput classsearch typetext nameq results0 placeholderSearchgt     ltfieldsetgt   ltformgt    ltul classtopnavigationgt      ltligtlta hrefgtHomeltagtltligt      ltligtlta hrefabout.htmlgtAbout Meltagtltligt      ltligtlta hrefarchive.htmlgtArchivesltagtltligt   ltulgt ltnavgt codepre  pAside from validation, is this not an acceptable use of codeltnavgtcode What would the repercussions be for one less concerned with validation, than to ensure screen readers and other accessibility tools can render the page properlyp

Wouldnt it be easier to just keep them out of the VCS, and create a migration queue on every machine that doesnt have to be kept in sync with everybody elses migraton queues p

Negative 24384 pThis is a pure best practice question. I am pretty new to Node and Mongoose. I absolutely love the technology and have been cranking away on a project to build a JSONbacked API for an app that Im building. p  pI am finding that I am continuously repeating code when I fetch objects from my database. For examplep  precodePlaylist.findByIdreq.params.id, functionerr,playlist   if err     return res.jsonerror Error fetching playlist   else if playlist     return res.jsonerror Error finding the playlist    Actual code being performed on the playlist that Im fetching  codepre  pThe error handling at the top of the function call is annoying because I have to repeat that code for every call to the database... or so I think.p  pI thought about using a callback likep  precodevar fetchCallback  functionerr,objOrDoc,callback   Handle the error messages   callbackobjOrDoc  codepre  pHowever, this approach would mess up my sequential flow since I would have to define the callback function before I performed the fetch. So, if I had a lot of database queries chained together, I would have to place the callbacks in reverse order, which is far from ideal in a cleancoding perspective.p  pIm wondering if anyone has run into this issue and has any best practices for cutting down on the repetition. p  pIm also using the express framework, so if theres a helpful way to handle it in express, Id be interested to know, too.p

Negative 24384 pWe are using a hrefhttplinux.die.netman2recv relnofollowrecv2a in order to listen to incoming ICMP packets in a network management application in which there is a status poll feature to ping all managed hosts.p  pIn a productive environment, the number of managed hosts can become pretty large 1,000, and at the moment, when said status poll is performed, we send out all the ping requests sequentially with no delay inbetween.p  pObviously, this will lead to many ping replies being sent back almost simultaneously, and it appears that our dispatching routine cannot catch up. This seems to cause that packets are dropped and the ping replies are never actually received by our application. We believe so because many hosts are falsely detected as being unavailable.p  pThe dispatcher doesnt do anything more than adding incoming replies to an inbox of sorts, which is processed later by another thread, ie it does not take much time and can probably not be optimized any further.p  pIs it possible that the internal packet buffer used by recv in the kernel in the network hardware fills up and starts dropping packets If so, is there a good way to determine a reasonable maximum amount of simultaneous pings that can be performed safely ie by getting that buffer size from the OSp

Negative 24384 pIve developed an app that was supposed to target both the Galaxy Nexus and the Galaxy S3. Both have 720 x 1280 screen resolutions and I have only used dp values in my app. The resources exist in the layoutxhdpi and the drawablexhdpi folders. Layout looks perfectly fine on the Nexus, but the padding values in dp is slightly off on the S3. I assume its because of the bigger screen size on S3 and difference in density. p  pHow can I create a separate folder for Nexus and S3 so I can take into account the different screen sizesp

Negative 24384 pWhile debugging a mixed mode application in VS2010, the breakpoint set on a line of code contained in an unmanaged c dll source file called from a managed c wrapper class shows the infamous The breakpoint will not currently be hit. No symbols have been loaded for this document info message when hovering the mouse over the breakpoint on the line in question. The breakpoint itself is a red circle with a yellow info triangle instead of the usual solid red orb.  Of course, the breakpoint isnt hit when the debugger is executed.  Most answers Ive found for this warning indicate the breakpoint hasnt been set properly, or that the expected dll is not being loaded, or that the associated pdb file is not located in the correct location, etc. etc. This is not the problem. The application does load and execute the referenced dll correctly. Ive verified that the correct pdb file, with the same file date as its dll, is located in the executables working directory along with the target dll itself. The debugger simply doesnt load the symbols for the dll, and the dll doesnt show in the Modules list.p  pNone of the solutions Ive found online work for this problem.  The dll doesnt show in the modules list available from DebugWindowsModules menu selection... even though it is, in fact, loaded. Breakpoints set in the wrapper class work correctly.p  pDeleting the bin and obj directories, cleaning and rebuilding the solution also doesnt help.p

Negative 24384 pI am building an application that allows authenticated users to use a Web browser to upload MP3 audio files of speeches to a server, for distributing the audio on a network.  The audio files need to use a specific bit rate 32kbps or less to ensure efficient use of bandwidth, and an approved sampling rate 22.050 or 44.100 to maximize compatibility.  Rather than validate these requirements following the upload using a serverside script, I was hoping to use HTML5 FileReader to determine this information prior to the upload.  If the browser detects an invalid bit rate andor sampling rate, the user can be advised of this, and the upload attempt can be blocked, until necessary revisions are made to the audio file.p  pIs this possible using HTML5  Please note that the question is regarding HTML5, not about my applications approach.  Can HTML5 detect the sampling rate andor bit rate of an MP3 audio filep  pFYI note  I am using an FTP java applet to perform the upload.  The applet is set up to automatically forward the user to a URL of my choosing following a successful upload.  This puts the heavy lifting on the client, rather than on the server.  Its also necessary because the final destination of each uploaded file is different they can be on different servers and different domains, possibly supporting different scripting languages on the server.  Any one server would quickly exceed its storage space otherwise, or if the serverside script did an FTP transfer, the servers performance would quickly degrade as a single point of failure.  So for my application, which stores uploaded audio files on multiple servers and multiple domains, validation of the bit rate and sampling rate must take place on the client side.p

Negative 24384 pIm working on a framework in which we have the concept of a task.  The hope is that lots of people will write tasks, and to do so they will simply need to implement the Task interface.  The tasks need to be triggered via their name, meaning there needs to be a central registry of tasknametaskclass somewhere.  Currently Im using an Enum to do this, but this requires task implementers to add code into the Enum for every task they implement, which is gross.p  pAnother option Ive come up with is to search via reflection for all classes that implement the Task interface and register them from there.  This also strikes me as gross and I feel there must be a better way.p  pA static initializer would be perfect if it didnt require the class be referenced at least once before it ran.p  pAnnotations are another option, but they require either more reflection work, or changing the build process if we were to do compile time codegen to make the dispatcher.p  pAny simpler ideasp  hr  pA simple version of what Im doing now is below, to give an idea of the control flow I want smashed into a single class for simplicityp  precodeclass Disp      interface Task          public String doTask           static class HelloTask implements Task          public String doTask              return Hello                    static class ByeTask implements Task          public String doTask              return Bye                    static class TaskDispatcher          static enum Tasks              Hello                  Task getTask                      return new HelloTask                              ,             Bye                  Task getTask                      return new ByeTask                                           abstract Task getTask                   public static Task getTaskString taskName              return Tasks.valueOftaskName.getTask                    public static void mainString[] args          System.out.printlnHello task says TaskDispatcher.getTaskHello.doTask         System.out.printlnBye task says TaskDispatcher.getTaskBye.doTask        codepre  pWhat would be much nicer is if the code to register say HelloTask could live only inside HelloTask and not have to leak out into TaskDispatcher As in the real project these are multiple different filesp

While its functional, I need something that can be more easily accessed on multiple computers, sometimes even public computers amp computers owned by clients, so I dont want to be limited by xMarks...we basically store URLs in notes on our smartphones so we can type them in when we need them...archaic, I knowp  pIt seems that it would be possible to simply have a form.

Negative 24384 pOn Unixlike systems dynamic shared libraries .so files have an codeSONAMEcode. It can be extracted for example with codereadelf a libfoo.so.0.3.2  grep SONAMEcode  codelibfoo.so.0code. The last part is also called the codeSOVERSIONcode. That version number marks versions of the library that are binary compatible ABI. So when a program links to one version of the library it can also use a later version if the codeSOVERSIONcode doesnt change.p  pa hrefhttpwww.sourceware.orgautobookautobookautobook91.html relnofollowLibtoola has a codeversioninfocode mechanism to decide such a codeSOVERSIONcode with codecurrentcode, coderevisioncode and codeagecode.

Negative 24384 pI was tasked with converting a fullfledged MS Access application that I created into an Oracle application. The Access database includes about a dozen tables and another dozen queries, including some VBA logic I had to use to rank things efficiently. Ive also got forms with VBA behind them to run the queries. My goal is to recreate this application on an Oracle server, setting up the same kinds of tables and queries, and using Application Express for user input. This is not going to be an environment with many users, but there could at times be 23 people accessing the same database. p  pMy question is as a developer of MS Access applications, can you recommend any quick guides as opposed to full books that can expose me to the major differences in design and approach in developing an Oracle application Im thinking of things like stored procedures, views, transactions, and things like that that arent available in MS Access. In the end, Ill need to know how to have different users use forms to edit and import data to the database as necessary, and to run the same queries and generate an output table specific to each user so not writing to the same table each time.p

Negative 24384 pI am doing a cross compiling [mips] of Qt and Qt based applications. Two developement machines one 64bit and other 32bit, are used for this purpose.  Generally Qt related libraries and binaries are cross compiled in 64 bit machine. Qt based application, is cross compiled in 32bit machine. p  pWith this setup, there is a small problem with usage of mocqmakeqrc etc These are compiled on 64bit machine and cannot run on the 32bit machine. p  pOne shortcut method, is to change the mkspec [Pass m32 instead of m64 in linuxg64 ].  This way issue is resolved. p  pWhat I wanted to know is, if we can configure Qt itself to use linuxg32 instead of 64, for compilation of qmakemoc etc binaries. p

Negative 24384 pI have an application built with CodeIgniter that a 3rd party service an email service provider is making http requests containing POST data to when certain events occur.

Negative 24384 pI am using ctypes to interface python code with a legacy C DLL. The DLL expects that I give it a function pointer to be used as a callback, that then will be called from within the DLL.p  pThe C declaration of that callback looks likep  precodechar foochar buf codepre  pSemantically the DLL expects that I let point buf to a string buffer that is managed by the callback and return 0 if everything works fine. In C that would be a static char[] variable mybuf and I would pass the address of that static buf back with code like p  precodebuf  ampmybuf[0]  return char0  codepre  pThe string in mybuf needs to be null terminated as usual in C. I was able to pass a function pointer to the DLL and now a python member functionp  precodedef pyfooself, charptrptr  codepre  pgets called.p  pThe class in which pyfoo is defined also initialises in stronginitstrong a fieldp  precodeself.responsecreatestringbufferThe Response String codepre  pHow do I pass the address, where this string is actually stored in memory to the DLL Since ctypes sometimes creates copies instead of returning a real reference by address I tried something likep  precodecpointer  cint.fromaddresscharptrptr[0] cpointer.value  addressofself.response return cchar0 codepre  pIt does not work. I tried other ways of dereferencing the passed pointerpointer and storing a memory address there e.g. directly storing what I think is the address of the string into charptrptr[0], but the caller of the callback is never doing what I am expecting it to do. p  pIf anybody has ever solved the problem to create a null terminated string in python and to pass the address of that string through a pointer to a DLL implemented in C, I would be very thankful to here about how heshe solved the issue.

Negative 24384 pI am having troubles with dependencies between two classes. The problem is the followingp  pI got two classes, Timestamp and Exception. Exception is abstract and all possible exceptions derive from this abstract class. Every exception has a timestamp to tell when the exception was thrown. So exceptions need to include in the language i am using it is called import the timestamp class. But wen working with timestamps errors can occur, so that exceptions are thrown. Therefor the timestamp class has to import the exception classes.p  pAnd there is my cyclic dependency. Now my actual question is and this is why it is independent from the language What would be a proper design in such a case to avoid cyclic dependencies I fail to solve this problem as I cannot figure out a solution to have this classes as independent as they are now but without the cyclic dependency.p

Negative 24384 pI am using setMethod to override the summary function for objects of different classes.p  pOriginally, I used this approachp  precodesetMethodsummary, class1,            functionobject, ...              code for class1 summary here...                        setMethodsummary, class2,           functionobject, ...              code for class2 summary here...                        setMethodsummary, class3,           functionobject, ...              code for class3 summary here...                       codepre  p...and so on for each class.p  pHowever, there are 12 different classes altogether, so the code became very repetitive.

All other API calls also work fine with ajax, listSubscribe is the only one I have any issues with. IF I type in an nonemail into the email field the listSUbscribe api function reports it as an error validation on the APIs part is clearly working as well, but if i do type an email, absolutely nothing happens. No users are added to the list and nothing is in my inbox, spam or trash folders.p  pCan anyone give me even a slight clue as to what the issue could be, im completely lost on this one.

Negative 24384 pWe are creating a WCF infrastructure to allow other systems in the organization to consume our business logic. Some of this logic has to do with user authentication, so securing the services is of high concern. The transport layer is secured by certificates. I am more concerned with securing the business layer.p  pOne of our clients calls these services in a certain sequence, in order to support a business process. What I would like to do is put in place some mechanism to verify that the sequence is indeed kept. The sequence can be disrupted by developer errors on the consuming side or by attackers trying to compromise the system. I do not want to put the logic of the process inside the services themselves, since this will couple them to this specific clients process. I would like to put the logic for coordinating the different services in a separate layer, which will be client specific or maybe something more generic to support any processp  pCan someone point me to specific patterns or resources which discuss this issue I have been searching Google for half a day, and I cant seem to find any resource discussing this specific issue.p

Negative 24384 pSo I have something weird going on and i can not pin down exactly what is causing it. My asp.net project is live with session state on two production servers that are synced using the following command p  precodemsdeploy verbsync sourcewebserver,computernameMACHINE,usernameAdministrator,passwordPASSWORD destwebserver 2ltamp1  codepre  pThe application is an asp.net 4.0 website that is run on two Server 2008 R2 web servers behind a load balanced configuration where the users are set to stick to one server once they connect. We have codeltMachineKeygtcode set hardcoded with validation and decryption keys in the root site of the application and it is the same between both servers.  My application is set up to forward exception events to our email system. p  pWhat is happening is that i am receiving the dreaded Validation of viewstate MAC failed from the servers but even though the server load is 5050 split the errors are coming in on a 991 split. So one web server is generating these errors considerably more often than the other one. This is strange considering the servers are synced and all configurations are identical. p  pIve done extensive searching on this problem and it seems quite difficult to find any solution that doesnt mention or do the following.p  ul licodeltMachineKeygtcode is not identical between servers. I know for a fact this is not my problemli liSetting codeenableViewStateMacfalsecode or some other setting that jeopardizes the site security. li liMake sure that all action tags on form inputs reference the same page they are placed onli liMake sure the instance ID of the servers are the same they areli liIf the user clicks through the page before the entire page viewstate has been downloaded my viewstate is set to render at the top of the page.li liIssues with response.redirect and server.transferli ul  pNow i have eliminated all except the last two as possible causes. My application has been running fine for over a year with no issues and right before these errors appeared i enabled SQL session state, migrated the project from .NET 3.5 to .NET 4.0, and set the set the server mode deployment mode to retail. I have tried recycling the application pools and performing an iis reset to no avail.  p  pDoes anyone else have any suggestions as to what i can look at Bottom line i do strongNOTstrong want to fix this by opening up security holes in my site. p  pIt appears this is happening to users right after they authenticate using forms authentication the first time they try to log in but i can not confirm this.

For ex.p  precode This works printfnTest1n hstring test char tmpc[50] scanfs,tmpc test.settmpc printfsn,test.get   This works printfnTest2n hstring test2[2] test2[0].setHello  test2[1].setworld printfs sn,test2[0].get,test2[1].get   This works printfnTest3n hstring test3[2] scanfs,tmpc test3[0].settmpc scanfs,tmpc test3[1].settmpc printfs sn,test3[0].get,test3[1].get   This, what I want to do, does NOT work printfnTest4n hstring test4  hstring malloc2sizeofhstring forint i0ilt2i     scanfs,tmpc     test4[i].settmpc  printfs s,test4[0],test4[1] freetest4 codepre  pIm confused as to why the fourth test doesnt properly run. It compiles but crashes upon reaching test4 and trying to reallocate memory in the code.setcode function. I get an access violation reading location error which made me assume I was writingreading somewhere that Im not supposed to however, I cannot determine the exact cause though I can tell the line causing the error is codescharreallocvoid s,sizesizeofscode when trying to reallocate the size of the character array. Does someone notice an issue that I have overlookedp

Under any of the users, the bash script works as expected when run from the command line.p  pWhen I run the bash script via the php script click on an html form that fires off the php script, then the scp command works correctly and the file is transferred, however the python script does not run.  The output from the php line containing ssh ... screen ... returns Must be connected to a terminal., but Im using the t option and as I mentioned, the bash script runs as expected when run from the command line.p  pAny ideas what Im doing wrongp  pWhat is the best way to run a python script remotely using a web interfacep  pThanks, rb3p

Negative 24384 pIm writing a program that needs to ask the user a yes or no question at the end. Going based off the example .exe my teacher provided us, the line is supposed to print out Would you like to print an Amortization TableYNY and it looks for one keystroke from the user. The Y is printed out following the question like I typed, as it is supposed to represent the default choice so if the user presses code[y]code, code[shift  y]code, or code[enter]code it goes to the function that does the amortization table and if the user presses anything else it goes to the next line When it gets the input from the user it processes the keystroke instantly as it is pressed it does not need code[enter]code to process the input without letting the keystroke appear on the command prompt. I have tried all the functions I can think of to do this getc, getchar, getche but everything I have tried ends up printing the users input. Does anyone know what function he used or what trick he is doing to keep the keystroke from appearing in the command prompt Thanks for your help in advance, I am obviously new to programming.p

Negative 24384 pIf I have a list, which contains the 4 nodes this test example is something of a small and I want to find every string that has is only 1 positive with this list.  This topic has been posted a large number of times, which I have used to help get me this far.  However, I cant see anywhere how I omit this from a positive result.  I could probably use stringcstr, then find it myself, after Ive reduced my much larger list.  Or is there a way I could use stringfindfirstof  It would seem theres a better way.

Negative 24384 pIve had a discussion with collegues this morning concerning forloopoptimization. It was pretty much the situation as described in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5116188cforloopoptimizationquestionthis questiona, however the code was CCLI and the method called a property emfrom a different assemblyem. Im aware that in this case the compiler cant optimize the loop by inlining the function. However, the subject was image processing and the properties called were width and height of an image, i.e.p  precodefor unsigned int y  0 y lt image.Height y      for unsigned int x  0 x lt image.Width x           Do something with pixel x,y       codepre  pFor a 5M grayscale image, that loop took about 450 ms, whereas when saving width and height to local variables before executing the loop, the time consumption was about 10 ms These numbers are only given to show the magnitude of the difference.p  pOf course, we are heading for the local variable solution now, but I wonder whether the naive forloop given above is actually bad design When writing such code, I wouldnt expect any real compiler optimization, but calls to emtrivialem properties like width and height of an image Id expect to return their value way quicker. So isnt the whole problem due to bad design of the image library authors When using trivial properties, shouldnt I prever readabilityp

Negative 24384 pSo I have this situation in which I need to collect information from a remote computer over a longrange and possibly somewhat unreliable WiFi connection via a TCP socket ensuring no information is lost is far more important than speed, and then rebroadcast it on the reliable end to other listeners via a multicast. This remote computer is a moving target, so simply tuning everything for a good range of sight is not possible. Ive created a diagram below.p  pThis remote computer isnt very powerful, so having all listeners connect to it via TCP sockets is not desirable, as it is already somewhat restricted in its available resources.p  pIt is also desirable, however, for this remote computer to be able to be discoverable when someone connects to its WiFi network. As far as I understand, this is usually accomplished with periodic UDP broadcasts.p  pNow my issue is how should I be doing this from a network perspective From what I understand, UDP broadcasts typically are not supposed to cross out of their LAN, which in this case would only be the 10.0.1.08 subnet... meaning the relay device behind the router would be unable to see it. Apparently, if you have a router that allows for complex configuration such as one running DDWRTTomato then you can force this behaviour across the respective VLANs...  which is apparently not a good idea I would assume that would screw up the DHCP too, allowing DHCP requests from clients on the router to be accidentally served by the longrange WiFi network.p  pMy other option is to do the service discovery via multicasting over a set port and multicast address all the clients know to listen on i.e. 224.239.74.245454, because multicasts are supposed to be able to cross LANs after simple configuration I suppose.p  pIn regard to multicasting though, Ive been lead to understand that doing it over WiFi is generally a bad idea not sure why though. Some of the monitoring devices may be connected over WiFi broadcasted from the intermediary router. I could change it such that all monitoring devices connect to the relay via TCP, but that does not seem scalable in the event that the relay is either relatively weak i.e. another embedded computer, or if an unprecedented number of monitoring devices are added to the network in the future.p  pBecause this network is completely closed not connected to the internet, Ive been wondering if IPv6 could be a solution. I dont know much about IPv6 aside from a ridiculous number of addresses and essentially no more subnetting. Ive read online that multicasting is inherent to the protocol unlike optional with IPv4, which would lead me to believe that whatever issue there is with multicasting over IPv4 on WiFi has been resolved. This is also assuming that all modern equipment is essentially IPv6 ready.p  pCould someone please advise me on what I should do from here Im not very experienced in this stuff and everything Ive written is speculative.p  pimg srchttpi.imgur.comcF0tHUo.png altWow, so networkp

Negative 24384 pIm rather used to use one database alone say PostgreSQL or ElasticSearch. But currently Im using a mix PG and ES in a prototype app and may throw other kind of dbs in the mix eg redis.p  pSay some piece of data need to be persisted to each databases in a different way. strongHow do you keep a system consistent in the event of a failure on one of the componentsdatabases strongp  pExample scenario that im facing Data update on PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch is unavailable. At this point, the system is inconsistent, as I should have updated both databases. As Im using an SQL db, I can simply abort the transaction to put the system in its previous consistent state.p  pBut what is the best way to keep the system consistent p  ul liCheck everytime that the value has been persisted in all databases li liIn case of failure, restore the previous state  But in some NoSQL databases there is no transactionACID mechanism, so I cant revert as easily the previous state.li ul  pAdditionnaly, if multiple databases must be kept in sync, is there any good practice to have, like adding some kind of version metadata whether a timestamp or an home made incrementing version number so you can put your databases back in sync  Not talking about CouchDB where it is builtinp  pMoreover, the databases are not all updated atomically so some part are inconsistent for a short period. I think it depends on the business of the app but does anyone have some thought about the problem that my occur or the way to fix that  I guess it must be tough and depends a lot of the configuration for maybe very few real benefits.p  pI guess this may be a common architecture issue but Im having trouble to find information on the subject.p

Negative 24384 pI know there are dozens of questions similar to this one, but I couldnt find an answer to my specific problem. Sorry if I missed it  please tell me where to look if it exists p  pThe problem seems very common to me I need a list of objects that is sorted by some property of the object, and only have each object once in the list. Specifically, I am implementing A path finding and need the open list sorted by the Fvalues of the nodes. p  pWhat I tried was using a TreeSet with a Comparator that compares the fvalues of two Nodes, like thisp  precodepublic class NodeFComparator implements ComparatorltNodegt       Override     public int compareNode arg0, Node arg1          return arg0.getF  arg1.getF        codepre  pClass Node is looking like this p  precodepublic class Node       PathableMap parentmap     Point coord     coordinates on the map     private Node parent     parent node used by astar to backtrace shortest path      etc etc             Fvalue of a node is the sum of the distance from start  distance to target.       The nodes are searched in the order of that value.           public int getF          return getG  getH           Override     public int hashCode          final int prime  65537         return prime  coord.x  coord.y           Override     public boolean equalsObject obj          if this  obj             return true         if obj  null             return false         if getClass  obj.getClass             return false         Node other  Node obj         if coord  null              if other.coord  null                 return false          else if coord.equalsother.coord             return false         return true        codepre  pThe problem with this solution seems to be that if two different nodes have the same fvalue which happens all the time, in other words the comparator returns 0, the TreeSet seems to treat that as Node1  Node2 and doesnt add the second node to the list or does some other weird thing because my openlist misses nodes that should be there.p  pSo the only way I can think of doing this with the existing classes is to use a simple ArrayList and sort it each time I append a Node to it.p  pIs there really no collection class in Java or Apache Commons thatp  ul likeeps a sorted list of objects by any property of an object li lihas fast lookup and insert timesli liis as easy to use as other collection classesli ul  pIm puzzled.p

Negative 24384 pDisclaimer Im emveryem new to the world of POS programming.p  pI need to do some programming of a Vx670 POS, and I would like to use C to that end.

Negative 24384 pI want to hide a page in navigation component based on the logged in user. I have two approaches in mind. Set permissions on the pages node in CRXDE denying it for all users and then allowing it for specific groups. I have been trying it not found much success. Else I can get the id of the logged in user in the jsp and based on the user group I can set the pages property Hide in Navigation . But I am not able to find how to set that property in jsp. Please suggest.p  pEdit I am using the default authentication.I wanted to hide a page from navigation in the default list component. If I use CUG the users belonging to that group will still be able to see that particular pages link in the list component and would be asked for login on clicking on that page.I want the link itself to be hidden if the user belonged to a particular group Thanks.p

I am unsure how to get the Boolean type to return a message if they leave the field blank or in an invalid format.p  pI was able to get everything working like a charm within my code using the  getPhoneInput method,  however is there a way to return something other than a true or false with a Boolean. I understand that is what it was built to do, but once I have the correct format i want the number written to a txt file. as it works now instead of logging a number with the users name it just tells me that their phone number matched the required format or that it did not with a true or false.p

N 1  NTHREADS displacement, 2  L1 displacement, 3  L2 displacement, 4  TAMNTHREADSp  pI am having a hard time trying to figure out why my parallel code runs just slighty faster than sequential code.p  pWhat I basically do is to loop through a big array 108 elements of a type intfloatdouble and apply the computation A  A  CONSTANT  B. Where A and B are arrays of same size.p  pSequential code only do a single function call. Parallel version create pthreads and uses the same function as starting function.p  pI am using gettimeofday, RDTSC and more recently getrusage to measure timings. My main results are expressed by Clocks per Element CPE. p  pMy processor is an i53570K. 4 Cores, no hyperthreading.p  pThe problem is that I can get up to 2.00 CPE under sequential code and when going parallel my best performance was 1.84 CPE. I know that I get an overhead by creating pthreads and calling more timing routines, but I dont think this is the reason for not getting better timings. I did measured each thread CPE and executed the program with 1, 2, 3 and 4 threads. When creating only one thread, I get the expected result CPE around 2.00  some overhead expressed in miliseconds but overall CPE is not affected at all.  When running with 2 threads or more the main CPE decreases, but each thread CPE increases. 2 threads I get main CPE around 1.9 and each thread to 3.8  Why this is not 2.0   The same happens to 3 and 4 threads. 4 threads I get main CPE around 1.85 my best timing and each thread with 7.07.5 CPE.p  pUsing many threads more than avaiable cores4 I still getting CPE under 2.0 but not better than 1.85 most times higher due to overhead.p  pI suspect that maybe context switching could be the limiting factor here. When running with 2 threads I can count 5 to 10 involuntary contexts switch from each thread... But I am not so sure about this. Are those seemly few context switches enough to almost double my CPE  I was expecting to atleast get around 1.00 CPE using all my CPU Cores.p  pI went further on this and analyzed the assembly code for this function. They are identical, except for some extra shifts and adds 4 instructions at the very beginning of the function and they are out of loops.p  pIn case you want to see some codep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltpthread.hgt include ltsystime.hgt include ltcpuid.hgt  typedef union    unsigned long long int64    struct unsigned int lo, hi int32  tsccounter  define RDTSCcpuc                    asm volatile rdtsc        a cpuc.int32.lo,              d cpuc.int32.hi   define CNST 5 define NTHREADS 4 define L1SIZE 8096 define L2SIZE 72512  typedef int datat  datat  A datat  B  int tam double avgthreadCPE tsccounter threadt0[NTHREADS], threadt1[NTHREADS] struct timeval threadsec0[NTHREADS], threadsec1[NTHREADS]  void fillABint tam     int i     for i0ilttami         A[i]2 B[i]2          return   void multsomapar4v4void arg     int w     int i,j     int id  int  arg     int limit  tam14     int size  tamNTHREADS     int tam2  id1size     int limit2  tam214      gettimeofdayampthreadsec0[id],NULL     RDTSCthreadt0[id]      Mult e Soma     for iidsizeiltlimit2 ampamp iltlimiti15           A[i]  A[i]  CNST  B[i]           A[i1]  A[i1]  CNST  B[i1]           A[i2]  A[i2]  CNST  B[i2]           A[i3]  A[i3]  CNST  B[i3]         A[i4]  A[i4]  CNST  B[i4]         A[i5]  A[i5]  CNST  B[i5]         A[i6]  A[i6]  CNST  B[i6]         A[i7]  A[i7]  CNST  B[i7]         A[i8]  A[i8]  CNST  B[i8]         A[i9]  A[i9]  CNST  B[i9]         A[i10]  A[i10]  CNST  B[i10]         A[i11]  A[i11]  CNST  B[i11]         A[i12]  A[i12]  CNST  B[i12]         A[i13]  A[i13]  CNST  B[i13]         A[i14]  A[i14]  CNST  B[i14]           for  ilttam2 ampamp ilttam i         A[i]  A[i]  CNST  B[i]      RDTSCthreadt1[id]     gettimeofdayampthreadsec1[id],NULL      double CPE, elapsedtime      CPE  doublethreadt1[id].int64threadt0[id].int64doublesize       elapsedtime  doublethreadsec1[id].tvsecthreadsec0[id].tvsec1000     elapsedtime doublethreadsec1[id].tvusec  threadsec0[id].tvusec1000       printfThread d workset  dn,id,size     printfCPE Thread d  lfn,id, CPE         printfTime Thread d  lfn,id, elapsedtime1000     avgthreadCPECPE       freearg     pthreadexitNULL    void imprimeint tam     int i     int ans  12     for i0ilttami         printfd ,A[i]         checking...         if A[i]ans printfWAn          printfn     return   int mainint argc, char argv[]     tsccounter t0,t1     struct timeval sec0,sec1     pthreadt thread[NTHREADS]      double CPE     double elapsedtime            int i     int id      tam  atoiargv[1]        A  datat malloc tamsizeofdatat     B  datat malloc tamsizeofdatat      fillABtam     avgthreadCPE  0      Start Computing...       gettimeofdayampsec0,NULL      RDTSCt0                                  Time Stamp 0      for i0iltNTHREADSi              id  int mallocsizeofint            id  i         if pthreadcreateampthread[i], NULL, multsomapar4v4, voidid               printfERRO pthreadcreaten exit1                        for i0 iltNTHREADS i           if pthreadjointhread[i], NULL                printfERRO pthreadjoin n exit1                         RDTSCt1                                  Time Stamp 1      gettimeofdayampsec1,NULL     End Computing...      imprimetam      CPE  doublet1.int64t0.int64doubletam        diferenca entre TimeStampsrepeticoes       elapsedtime  doublesec1.tvsecsec0.tvsec1000      elapsedtime doublesec1.tvusec  sec0.tvusec1000       printfMain CPE lfn,CPE      printfAvg Thread CPE lfn,avgthreadCPENTHREADS      printfTime lfn,elapsedtime1000      freeA freeB      return 0     codepre  pI appreciate any help.p

The whole point of it is to act like a bedside clock, the user can easily tap a button for the time to light up, in this case that button is the screen.p  pWhat I want to do is turn off the screen after a certain amount of time a preference in the applications settings then listen for screen presses. When the user taps the screen it will turn the screen back on until it times out again or the user destroys the activity, at which point screen time out will default to their phones settings.p  pAny help would be much appreciated.p

I decompiled the swf files Im looking at along but also have the swf file itself. p  pI would like to know what size the file displays as dimensions.p  pMy first thought was to try using image size comparison.p  blockquote   pMy issue with this is that some images that are used as assets in the swf are actually larger than the swf itself, otherwise I would use PIL to simply get the dimensions of the largest image asset ex the background.p      pSecondly my other issue is that can equally compare svg and png files.. and Pillow and Pil to my knowledge do not handle svg files. p blockquote  pMy second idea was to search the actionscript code for the dimensions.p  blockquote   pSome files have in their action script something like 300x300 which denotes the size. Unfortunately after looking at most of the files I am working with do not which means this is largely unhelpful. p blockquote  pMy 3rd idea was to ignore the decompiled swf data and rather focus on the swf itself. p  blockquote   pI could in theory either try to find the dimensions in the byte code or use a library that does this which I need to find one as pip and pillow do not appear to work or I need to run the ad and then screenshot it and try to find where the ad starts and stops and calculate the pixels based on that. My problem with screens shotting it is that the image may blend into the background and make it hard if not impossible to get the correct dimensions, but more importantly many swfs cannot be played due to security if they are not played in the right url, etc. p blockquote  pThus Im left with a dilemma. I think the best way to go about this would be to use the swf file itself. p

Instead, the row is never built or, when we tried to fix it by changing the WHERE conditions, it brought PriceFactor1 from a different row, which is also no good.p  pHow its supposed to workp  pA row is created in table Orders.

But without passing row by row, we arent sure how to check each individual Order to see if has a matching Price before building the row in Shipments.p  pI know there are details missing here, but I didnt want to write a 1,000 page question.

Negative 24384 pIm working on learning Bootstrap 3 and Less, and Ive hit a dead end before Ive even gotten started. After two days of trial and error, I finally landed on Koala for compiling Less into CSS. Im on Mac OS 10.7, so Codekit is out only runs on 8 now, and since Koala actually runs and Ive installed a dozen pieces of software is trying to implement this workflow, including but not limited to Grunt, Ruby, Git, Bower, Jekyll, GCC, Node.js, not to mention various IDEs and text editors, I am loathe to keep trying more options, and I just hope theres some simple concept Im missing. p  pI havent even been able to start any hands on learning of Less because Ive been wrestling with understanding and setting up this workflow. I finally got Koala to see the source Less and destination css files in my Bootstrap project, but when I tried to compile anything with a straight, installedviaBower Bootstrap, I get a boatload of errors, and the code is not compiled. The targetdestination css file remains unchanged.p  pI would really like to have some kind of app that keeps me out of the command line Ive spent enough time there today to last me a lifetime. Besides that, while having error detection is great, are the default BS 3 files really so riddled with errors I have to kind of doubt it, and presume that Koalas just behind.p  pNote also that I have Koala set to Auto Compile, but it only throws errors when I try to compile manually. It has never compiled, even though Ive successfully edited the config json file to getput compressed files in the right place. p  pE.g., trying to compile alerts.less, log shows the following errorp  precodeNameError variable alertpadding is undefined in UsersmattkDocumentsiliumweb2014bootstrapbowerbowercomponentsbootstraplessalerts.less1011 9 .alert  10   padding alertpadding 11   marginbottom lineheightcomputed codepre  pTrying to compile carousel.less, log shows thisp  precodeNameError .transition is undefined in UsersmattkDocumentsiliumweb2014bootstrapbowerbowercomponentsbootstraplesscarousel.less204 19     position relative 20     .transition.6s easeinout left 21  codepre  pTo recap, my questions are Why is Koala not auto compiling, and furthermore, why is it not compiling at all Do these errors prevent the process from completing If Bootstraps default .less files wont compile, then what hope do I have of editing files that willp  pIve always considered myself to be at least halfway bright, and while Im no programmer, Ive always loved code CSS and JQuery make me physically excited. But man, after this illfated attempt to get my head around Less, its putting me off of this whole webbuilding thing. p  pWhat am I missing It seems pretty common that people run into less compilers that dont, but Im running out of options here. I installed a lot of the things mentioned above initilly just thinking I could bite the bullet and stay in the command line in my workflow, but its hard to say since I cant seem to even get to the point where Im editing .less files anyway.p

Negative 24384 pI am using codeopendirreaddircode in a C program GNU on cygwin to collect the filenames from some nested directories into a string array the program uses largely C89 and earlier conventions. Since I dont know the number of files in advance I decided to use codemallocrealloccode to perform dynamic memory allocation. A pointer array is passed through recursive calls to collect filenames. The problem is that filenames stored during early calls to codegetlistcode are being corrupted during later storage steps. After going into a subdirectory, performing a second call to coderealloccode and emerging from the subdirectory, strings at the edge of the storage at the point after the coderealloccode was executed are progressively corrupted as additional filenames are collected in the parent directory. p  pIf instead I allocate memory using a single codemalloccode assignment to create a large initial pointer array I avoid the problem, but Id like to be able to use coderealloccode. Can anyone point out what I am doing wrong, specifically I guess its how I am using coderealloccode in this case p  precodeinclude ltstring.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltsignal.hgt  include ltstdio.hgt include ltstddef.hgt include ltsystypes.hgt include ltdirent.hgt include ltsysstat.hgt   function prototypes char  getlistchar  filelist,long int numfiles,char dirname  extern int stat const char filename, struct stat buf    extern DIR  opendir const char dirname extern  struct dirent  readdir DIR dirstream  int mainint narg, char argv[]         vars     char  dirname     char filelist, traverse      long int numfiles 0     FILE pfile      ....................................      and go ...      if  filelist  char mallocsizeofchar    NULL                    printfFatal malloc errorn              exit3          filelist  getlistfilelist,ampnumfiles,argv[1]  argv[1] is dir name        list the stored filenames and write to file      pfile  fopenlistoutput.txt,w     printfStored filenames Nin,numfiles     traverse  filelist         whiletraverse              printfsn,traverse         fprintfpfile,sn,traverse         traverse          fclosepfile       free etc should go here...      return 0      char  getlistchar filelist, long int numfiles, char dirname        variables     char filename[200]     char dirname[200]     DIR  directory     struct dirent  file      strcpydirname,dirname       for checking file type      macro   int SISREG modet m       struct stat filestat  mallocsizeofstruct stat     int sizeofchar  sizeofchar  fields modet stmode, unsigned char dnamlen      char traverse, ptemp       aux     long int ii, icheck           check number of valid files in dirname and allocate memory in char pointer array     ii0      directory  opendir dirname      whilefile  readdirdirectory              sprintffilename,ss,dirname,filegtdname         icheck  statfilename,filestat         if icheck0                      if SISREGfilestatgtstmode ii                  else                      printfCouldnt check file type of file s  icheck  in, filename, icheck                     generate enough room for all the filename strings      if  filelistchar reallocfilelist,sizeofchar numfilesii1    NULL               printfFatal realloc errorn         exit3           traverse  filelist  numfiles        now store the filenames in filelist ...      void rewinddir directory        whilefile  readdirdirectory              sprintffilename,ss,dirname,filegtdname         icheck  statfilename,filestat         if icheck0 ampamp SISREGfilestatgtstmode                      traverse  char mallocsizeofcharstrlenfilename1             strcpytraverse,filename             traverse             numfiles               spit out what we have so far             printfnCurrent list loopingnn             ptemp  filelist                iinumfiles             whileii                              printfsn,ptemp                 ptemp                          printfnn                    sleep1                   else if icheck0 ampamp SISDIRfilestatgtstmode                      if strcmpfilegtdname,.0 ampamp strcmpfilegtdname,..0                               printfProcessing folder sn, filename                 filelist  getlistfilelist,numfiles,filename                 traverse  filelist  numfiles                    spit out what we have so far                 printfnCurrent list returned from getlistnn                 ptemp  filelist                    whileptemp                                      printfsn,ptemp                     ptemp                                  printfnn                                        void closedir directory      traverse  NULL      return filelist      codepre

As its said in the documentation a hrefhttpsgithub.comexpressjsmorganblobmasterREADME.md relnofollowhttpsgithub.comexpressjsmorganblobmasterREADME.mda one of the paramateres it takes is stream which defines the output.

Negative 24384 pIve got this problem that Ive been trying to solve for a week and Im at wits end which, well, most likely means my wits not so great, since it doesnt seem to be a very hard problem nonetheless Im very new to Javascript and am trying to look at this as a learning experience.p  pI wanted to have a fixed position element that would rotate as a user scrolls the page. Doing so in CSS is trivially easy, however it doesnt work all that great, especially across browsers works fine in Chrome, but is janky in Firefox and under stress when I turn on FPS meter or some other stuff in Chrome Developer Tools it stops working correctly  I assume it would also behave similarly if there was another CPUextensive app open etc.. So I figured that animating in the canvas would be a more stable technique.p  pDoing the basic animation in the canvas is, again, rather easy. However I started having problems while trying to emulate the CSS transition effect. In short, Im trying to emulate a code like thisp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtmlgt ltheadgt     lttitlegtPage Titlelttitlegt     ltstylegt         body              height 3000px                  square              margin 50px             width 150px             height 150px             position fixed             backgroundcolor black             transition transform linear 0.3s              ltstylegt     ltscriptgt         window.onload  function               var deg  0             var pos  window.pageYOffset             var square  document.getElementByIdsquare              window.onscroll  function                  var npos  window.pageYOffset                 deg  npos  pos  10                 pos  npos                 square.style.transform  rotate  deg  deg                           ltscriptgt ltheadgt ltbodygt     ltdiv idsquaregtltdivgt ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pAnd what Ive got currently is below.

Negative 24384 pI have what I think is a simple question, but cannot find a simple answer.p  pI wanted to override the codetoStringcode method in codeSystem.IO.FileInfocode however, my usual ways of doing this dont seem to work.p  pI had thought of creating a new class which inherited from codeSystem.IO.FileInfocode, but I cannot do this because the method is defined as sealed codepublic sealed class FileInfo  FileSystemInfocode.p  pI tried creating a partial class however, since codeSystem.IOcode is in a different assembly I wasnt able to get it to work properly.p  pI even considered creating an extension method, and while that worked for creating a new method I wasnt able to simply override codetoStringcode.p  hr  pEssentially, in the currently implementation I have a listbox, and its items are a collection of codeFileInfocode items. Currently the codetoStringcode just prints the name, but I wanted to have an entry with a little more information.p  pI understand a codeDataGridViewcode would be more appropriate, but I dont really need multicolumns. I thought I could just set the ListBoxs codeDisplayMembercode to my extension method... but, now I realize codeDisplayMembercode needs to point to a property... not a method.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestionsp  pThank youp
Negative 24384 pI have a standard ASP.NET web page. It issues a query, using Ajax, to a SQL Server, and returns a table of results. The problem is, sometimes this table of results is very large and the query takes too long. I dont have control over the SQL, this happens via a stored procedure.p  pIs there a way to have a Cancel Request button on the page, so that when the user clicks the button the query on the SQL server is killed If so, how would I do that I am new to ASP.NETC, but understand the architecture of web requests. Thanks.p
Negative 24384 pI need a way to set an async task as long running without using Task.Factory.StartNew... and instead using Task.Run... or something similar.p  pContextp  pI have Task that loops continuously until it is externally canceled that I would like to set as long running i.e. give it a dedicated thread. This can be achieved through the code belowp  precodevar cts  new CancellationTokenSource Task t  Task.Factory.StartNew async  gt  while true      cts.Token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested     try              Running....Dump         await Task.Delay500, cts.Token          catch TaskCanceledException ex    , cts.Token, TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning, TaskScheduler.Default codepre  pThe problem is that Task.Factory.StartNew... does not return the active async task that is passed in but rather a task of running the Action which functionally always has taskStatus of RanToCompletion. Since my code needs to be able to track the tasks status to see when it becomes Canceled or Faulted I need to use something like belowp  precodevar cts  new CancellationTokenSource Task t  Task.Run async  gt  while true      cts.Token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested     try              Running....Dump         await Task.Delay500, cts.Token          catch TaskCanceledException ex    , cts.Token codepre  pTask.Run..., as desired, returns the async process itself allowing me to obtain actual statuses of Canceled or Faulted. I cannot specify the task as long running, however. So, anyone know how to best go about running an async task while both storing that active task itself with desired taskStatus and setting the task to long runningp

Negative 24384 pI use vim as an editor for hg. So every time I want to check something in, hg fires up vim to enter the check in message.

Strangely enough, everything works as expected, when I remove the ampersand.p  pThe thing I dont understand is, why is the array getting modified at all, even though I dont do anything with the reference variable ampitem variable except echoing it.p  pI also tried reset between the loops. But it didnt change anything, and according to the manual it shouldnt be necessary anyway in such a case at lease from my understanding because the loops start after each other and are not nested somehow.p  pThanks a lotp  pBerndp

Negative 24384 phopefully someone might be able to show me what Im doing wrong. p  pIm writing a small android app to send commands to SSH servers. I have the following code in a separate method running on its own thread into which I pass username, server, and command. p  pI send a command and it puts a toast on the screen showing the output of that command. Now the code works with my windows machine running an SSH server. It also works sort of with my raspberry pi. However, if I send a command like pwd to the pi I get the current directory back. Cool. If i send sudo touch mediaMYUSBSTICKtestfile it will create a file in the path specified.

Negative 24384 pIn the JSTL codefmtcode tag library is the tag codeformatDatecode, which has an optional attribute codevarcode. When using the codeformatDatecode tag, you can pass in a string via the codevarcode attribute that specifies the name of the variable that will be created, whose value will be the formatted date string.p  pUnfortunately, Java as of Java 8 doesnt support the Tongan and Samoan locales, which I need. Therefore, a coworker created a custom date formatting tag that basically just formats the date using codefmtformatDatecode but then in the case of Tongan and Samoan replaces the day name and month name values with the appropriate translations. However, this custom tag only outputs using codecoutcode the result, and Id like to enhance the custom tag to be able to create a variable, just like codefmtformatDatecode does. Unfortunately, I dont know how.p  pcodecsetcode doesnt allow expressions in its codevarcode attribute, and for some reason codepageContextcode is null inside the custom tag file dateformatter.tag.p  pSo heres what I have for the tag definition, minus extraneous details assume the codeccode and codefmtcode taglibs are included, as well as the codedateFormatterLocalecode variablep  precodeltattribute namevalue typejava.util.Date requiredtrue rtexprvaluetrue description... gt ltattribute nametype requiredtrue rtexprvaluetrue description... gt ltattribute namepattern requiredtrue rtexprvaluetrue description... gt ltattribute namevar requiredfalse rtexprvaluefalse description... gt  ltfmtformatDate typetype patternpattern valuevalue vardfFormattedDate gt ltcif testdateFormatterLocale  to  dateFormatterLocale  smgt     ...

Negative 24384 pLets start with some detailsp  pIm working with Visual Studio 2010 Express. I have 2 separate projects under one solution. The first project is the main game and contains all the source files. The second is a level editor that uses the games source files but starts from a different class, starting the level editor. Both projects have different namespacesp  pThe level editor has a project reference to the game and depends on it as such, the game builds before the level editor when compiling. What I want to do is add a conditional compilation symbol called LEVELEDITOR in the level editor project so I can use it for specific level editor features.p  pThe problem is that I simply cannot get the game to recognize the LEVELEDITOR symbol even though I defined it in the level editors project build settings. I went as far as creating a new library, adding references to the library in both projects, and then adding the symbol to the level editor class but even that failed as the library was not able to recognize the symbol.p  pI looked at Universal Apps to see how they did things, and I found that they have essentially the same project structure as me but have some inner workings that allow the symbols to work.p  pI would greatly appreciate it if someone can help with this issue. I can work around the symbols, but it wouldnt be as nice and convenient as just using the symbols themselves. Thanks in advancep

Negative 24384 pAs I was reading a colleagues Java code, I stumbled upon an army of ifelse statements.  In these statements, several codeampampcode and codecode operators were fighting each other without any help from parenthesis.  I simplified the statements intop  precodeif true  true ampamp false   return true else   return false codepre  pWhat do you think the result would be Honestly, I thought it would be codefalsecode, but it seems shortcircuiting doesnt work like I expected. In this case, the result is codetruecode. The shortcircuit mechanism seems to consider the whole expression as codetruecode when it finds codetruecode immediately followed by codecode.p  pBut in the reversed expression, what is the resultp  precodeif false ampamp true  true   return true else   return false codepre  pIf we follow the same logic, it should be false. the first boolean is codefalsecode and it is immediately followed by codeampampcode, but the result is codetruecode, once again. This makes sense to me, but it seems incompatible with our previous experiment.p  pSo heres my theoryp  pIf we find a codetruecode followed by codecode, then it is codetruecode, no matter what might comes next, even if there is a long list of other logical operators coming after. But if we find a codefalsecode followed by codeampampcode, it only shortcircuits the next element, not the whole statement.p  pAnd heres my questionp  pAm I right It seems a bit silly to me. Is codetruecode stronger than codefalsecodep

Negative 24384 pIm using Network Simulator 2 NS2 to implementevaluate a MAC protocol.

The issue I seem to be getting is that it doesnt seem to recognize the name of my protocol from the TCL file. It gives me the error p  precode    invalid command name Macpa3          while executing     valmac set repeatTx valrepeatTimes       file pa3.tcl line 45 codepre  pWhere line 45 is as follows p  precode    valmac set repeatTx valrepeatTimes codepre  pIt seems like it doesnt recognize the name of my protocol. Ive implemented the protocol in pa3.cc and pa3.h files respectively. When I type .configure then make clean, then make from the ns2.34 directory, it compiles without errors and generates the pa3.o object file. p  pI thought my TCL file was broken at first but it turns out that if I change the name to 80211, it works fine with my TCL file. I believe that the error mentioned on line 45 is flagged because it doesnt think I have a protocol called pa3 installed. p  pPlease advise as Ive been coming up with dead ends for the past few days. Has anyone used NS2 and can tell me the procedure to add your own protocol I dont want help evaluating the protocol but it seems I need to make the TCL file somehow recognize my pa3 protocol. Ive searched and searched but nothing Ive tried has worked.p  pThank You.p

Negative 24384 pI am using a complied Emscripten port of LibTIFF C code called tiff.js by seikichi on github. In my code I need to get some of the TIFF Tags. In tiff.js you can call tiff.getFieldtag value. One tag I need specifically is ROWSPERSTRIP with is 278 so to get this tag I call as followsp  precodevar rps  tiff.getField278 return rows per strip tiff tag codepre  pThis seems to work fine for some smaller values 1 to 176 not exactly sure yet but I have several files that AsTiffTagViewer reports as 224 rows per strip and one that file with 746 rows per strip. However tiff.js gets reports both of this values incorrectly as 6 and 1 respectively. I was stepping through the debugger in tiff.js and notice it comes to a place with the following codep  precodedoifbgtgtgt0lt65535de[j24gtgt1]0if1ltltdamp31ampc[a40dgtgtgt5ltlt2gtgt2]00k0elsebreakifreturn k0while0 codepre  pIts ugly I suspect because its the best Emscripten can do with C code. Now I know what  and ltlt do but I cant seem to find anything about . I dont have any idea yet if this is the section of code in tiff.js that is causing tiff.getField278 to not return some larger rows per strip values incorrectly all I know right now is it appears smaller rows per strip values are returned correctly where as larger ones are not returned correctly it appears.p  pSo my main question is what is  and my second question is does anyone have any ideas on why tiff.getField278 may not be working correctly for larger values. NOTE most of the other basic TIFF Tags do return correct values such as tiff.getFieldPHOTOMETRIC and tiff.getFieldSAMPLESPERPIXLE...etc.p  pThanks in advance for ideasp

I think If this was the case, thenp  pInside the img.onload function, since there is only one property in resourceCache at this time and it has been set to img, the isReady call will return true, and readyCallbacks will be called. However, since the .onReady function hasnt been executedthe program is still in the Resources.load function, there is nothing in readyCallbacks at this time, so the program will do nothing, but later on, since img.onload has been fired, it will not be fired again, thus after Resources.onReady is executed and the init function is inserted into readyCallbacks, it will not be invoked, so the game wont be initiated.p  pI was reading the code, when I got here I couldnt understand. After I run the code step by step, I find out that it actually takes time for the images to be loaded, even though they are all local. Using performance.now, I found that it takes a picture about 0.5ms to be loaded, by then the for loop in which load is called has completed, and the 2nd and 3rd resourceCaches properties have been set to false, so isReady wont evaluate to true, and the code will behave normally. And if there is only one image to load, then before the image is loaded, the .onReady  which is after Resource.load  will have been called and init will have been inserted into readyCallback, and the code will work too.p  pIf there is nothing wrong with the above analysis of mine, then there is one thing I still dont understand can we really rely on this image loading time being more than other codes execution time what if the images are really small and img.onload fires before another property of rescourceCache is set to false or the readyCallback has been set up If so the code wont work.p  pWhen I think further, I cant understand why we have to putp  precode    if isReady          readyCallbacks.forEachfunction func              func               codepre  pin the img.onload function, which makes it being executed multiple times when we are to load multiple images. Can we just put it after the .load call in the  After all, its purpose is to check if all the images have been loaded.p

In the code shown above, I disabled via comments instructions to center the image in this way, the component seems to work properly.p  pInstead, if I enable such instructions, the image is correctly positioned in the center of the panel when it is smaller than the panel itself, however, I encountered the following problem suppose that it is currently displayed an image larger than the panel, if the new image that I decide to load is smaller than the currently displayed image, then the new image is not displayed if I try to reload the new image, then it appears.p  pWhy does this problem occur

Negative 24384 pI have developed an application that uses bidirectional communication between two inapplication programsprocesses. I am using DatagramSocket purposely for a reason. In the server side of the application, when I send a DatagramPacket, it is not being received by the client but by the server itself, since the server receives message just after it sends. This is because the client and server have the same host address. The problem would not have occurred if the client and server program were running on a different machine.

The advantage is that matlab will automatically choose the plain matlab version if the right mex file is not present.p  pNow, my question si the following  is it possible to tell matlab to use, at some point, the plain version, even if the right mex file emisem present  This is mostly for performances comparaisons.p  pThanks a lot for your help,p

Negative 24384 pIm having trouble with a regular expression Ive developed specifically for dealing with migration from SQL Server 2012 to 2008.  If youve done this process before, you know that you cant use SSIS to copy Timestamp columns or you will get an error message.  To work around this, I developed a regex to comment out all the timestamp columns for the destination database, then SSIS works fine.p  pNow Im trying to develop a regex to collect all the timestamp columns into a single script so that I can add all those missing columns I left out before there are over 200.  Here is a sample code from the filep  precode Object  Table [dbo].[PNotice]    Script Date 7272015 103032 AM  SET ANSINULLS ON GO SET QUOTEDIDENTIFIER ON GO SET ANSIPADDING ON GO CREATE TABLE [dbo].[PNotice]     [NoticeID] [int] NOT NULL,     [NoticeText] [varchar]max NOT NULL,   [TimeStamp] [timestamp] NOT NULL,  CONSTRAINT [PKPNoticeNoticeID] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED       [NoticeID] ASC WITH PADINDEX  OFF, STATISTICSNORECOMPUTE  OFF, IGNOREDUPKEY  OFF, ALLOWROWLOCKS  ON, ALLOWPAGELOCKS  ON ON [PRIMARY]  ON [PRIMARY] TEXTIMAGEON [PRIMARY]  GO SET ANSIPADDING OFF GO   Object  Table [dbo].[UpdateType]    Script Date 7272015 103032 AM  SET ANSINULLS ON GO SET QUOTEDIDENTIFIER ON GO SET ANSIPADDING ON GO CREATE TABLE [dbo].[UpdateType]     [ItemType] [int] NOT NULL,     [ItemDescripton] [varchar]50 NULL  ON [PRIMARY]  GO SET ANSIPADDING OFF GO codepre  pThis sample file shows two tables, one with a timestamp column and one without.  So I wrote a regex to match the entire CREATE TABLE clause, only for tables with a commented timestamp column.  The regex appears to work fine for a little while, then at a certain point in the master script it suddenly matches the entire file, as though it timed out or reached some internal limitp  pExpandedp  precodeCREATE TABLE []    []n                    []n               s[[]]] [timestamp]    []n                    []n                ON [PRIMARY] TEXTIMAGEON [PRIMARY] codepre  pSingle expressionp  precodeCREATE TABLE [][]n[]ns[[]]] [timestamp][]n[]n ON [PRIMARY] TEXTIMAGEON [PRIMARY] codepre  pThe idea is to find CREATE TABLE, then table name, then all of the contents until we find the final closing parenthesis.  It is complicated by the fact there are often parenthesized subexpressions inside the CREATE TABLE clause, so I added handling for those.  Finally, I want to make sure the timestamp column is present, so I duplicated my entire match expression for matching stuff before and after the timestamp column.p  pHere is an online example demonstrating it working a hrefhttpregexr.com3bfns relnofollowhttpregexr.com3bfnsa.  This final version works great... until at some point in the file it just blows up with no explanation.  Here is an alternative SQL sample that will demonstrate the problem a hrefhttppastebin.comJtGh6tfM relnofollowhttppastebin.comJtGh6tfMa. WARNING If you try and paste this in regexr tester, it may lock up your browser.  Try it in Notepad to see the issue I was talking about, where it runs for about 10 seconds, then just highlights the whole file.p  pIm not sure if my regex is too complicated, or if there is some timeout builtin to NotePad regex matcher, or if there is some bug in my regex  How can I make it more efficient so it can handle a very large file without issues like thisp

Negative 24384 pI want to be able to apply conditional formatting quickly to rows in a series of tables in Excel using Excel 2007 currently to pick out the maximum and minimum value in each row. Its easy enough to do it a row at a time simply select the row, Click on Conditional Formatting, pick TopBottom rules, pick Top 10 items, change the code10code to a code1code  and then repeat the process for the Bottom 1 item.  Slow.  p  pBut if I try to copy amp pastespecial formatting to remaining rows in what might be a long table, then it picks out the top and bottom for the whole block  not whats wanted.p  pAs it happens, I think I can figure out a way to do it with a VBA macro so youd select the block and run the macro via keyboard accelerator but I prefer not to expose team members to VBA for all sorts of reasons.  So ideally Im looking for a formula that I can put in the new rule dialogue. I figure the formula if it can be devised would, for each cell to which it applies, test its value against the MAX MIN for a second rule of all values in the current row  where rows are as wide as they happen to be for that block of data.p  pIve been boggling at combinations of INDEX, INDIRECT, ROW, and I keep thinking Ive almost got it, only to find Im stumped again.p  pAny ideas, or is it impossiblep

Negative 24384 pThere are a couple of posts similar to this, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19102074woocommercecartpageaddingextraptagsherea and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14269033woocommercecartaddingextraptagsherea, but they are slightly different in scope, and more importantly, neither of them solve the problem.p  pMy Title is that it is impossible to remove the wpautop filter from the WooCommerce Cart Template, because I have found it to be literally impossible, but Im putting this out here, because there are many people much smarter than myself. I have gone so far as going into the Wordpress Core and disabling wpautop, and deactivating every plugin except WooCommerce, putting every removefilteraddfilter in functions.php possible, and removing every reference in the WooCommerce plugin of wpautop, and it is still autoformatting my template file with paragraph tags.p  pAnd yes, you have read it correctly, it is autoformatting the lines within the template file itself not content being pulled in from the database.p  pAnd I know that it is the wpautop function, because when I went into the Wordpress core and changed the function of wpautop to not add any paragraph tags, it fixed the problem. However, that is not a feasible solution.p  pDoes anyone know anyway that I can keep WooCommerceWordpress from using the wpautop function on my WooCommerce template file cartempty.php.p

Negative 24384 pI have this sample data and part of the query a hrefhttpsqlfiddle.com6b53e92 relnofollowSee the Fiddlea. It shows the segment start time and end time. The task is get the sum of all the time segments between 6am to 10pm in seconds.

Similarly if a segment starts at 9pm and finished at 5am then I want to get 3600 seconds i.e. the part before 10pm.p  precodeSelect    userid,   CASE     WHEN DateDiffday, starttime, endtime  0 THEN datediffsecond, starttime, endtime    END As TotalSecondsFromSixAMToTenPM       FROM   Test codepre  pHere is the expected result, Note the first and second last value is obtained by taking these values p  precodeSelect datediffsecond,  20150114 060000.000, 20150114 092554.000 Select datediffsecond, 20150114 213014.000, 20150114 220000.000     userid  TotalSecondsFromSixAMToTenPM    abc     12354                          abc     3600                           abc     15150                          abc     14684                          abc     1786                           abc     NULL                           codepre
