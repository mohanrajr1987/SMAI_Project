Positive 1805 pOn starting the El Capitan install from a running Yosemite OS an error dialog may appear complaining that there isnt enough free space on the startup disk to proceed. p  pAfter seeing this i erased some large files then tried again. This time the install continued to the point where, after reboot, it tried to proceed for about 30 minutes before it gave up. Once again it complained that there wasnt enough free disk space. Apparently it underestimates the amount it needs on starting the install.p

Positive 1805 pIn my current work environment, we have a setup where we have a central server database, and that connects to a mobile app that has certain information sent to it and stored in a localized database, at least from what I understand. A family member mentioned a program he uses for member management and I was wondering if I could take a shot at building something similar, but I really have no idea how to build something from the ground up or get it deployed anywhere. p  pThe main concern is that I dont know how to get a localized database set up and packaged into an installer. Heck I dont even know how to make an installer at ALL. Every answer I look up talks about needing to have a database server installed already, and I cant find any info on how it gets packaged in with applications. If the answer to that kind of thing is too longwinded Im find with article links, I just need a place to get start. Im most familiar with TSQL and C but since this is all experimental, advice regarding applications of any language is appreciated. p  pThanksp

The part number is DM1820171 for this kit.p  pI followed Microchips instructions for downloading the USB driver, but the installer tool for USB provided doesnt work.p  pTo see these instructions, Google the MCS3142 Dual KeeLoq Encoder Wireless Remote Control Development Kit Users Guide and scroll to section 8.2 in the PDF. This section provides several links for finding and downloading the installer tools.p  pThe GUI downloads, both the KeyLoq encoder and decoder, downloaded just fine. For some reason, it was finicky about where it was downloaded. I fixed it by creating a folder on the desktop and changing the directory to that, but I dont know how that fixed anything.p  pIm using a 64bit Windows 7 OS, and am using the x64 installer tool that goes with that version. I created a ticket on Microchips website, but they havent gotten back to me yet. When I spoke to Microchip yesterday for a different issue, they admitted that this is a rather niche board.p  pThere are a ton of files you need just to get started with this thing, and virtually no tutorials online beyond Microchips documentation. Oh, and enjoy random freezing on your computer if you try to download the USB installer too many times. I had to restart my computer twice now.p
Positive 1805 pToday, on my MacBook Pro with OS X 10.10.3, I launched the App Store application and downloaded XCode 7. After the download has ended, I cannot find any update file on my disk. App Store says XCode 7 is installed, but indeed its not. The XCode application on my disk is still the old version 6.4 and there is no trace of the XCode 7, nor an installer on my disk. I launched XCode 6.4 hopefully some upgrading should have been launched afterwards, but nothing happened. The About window confirms its the version 6.4 6E35b. I turned off the machine and rebooted. Nothing changed. So I downloaded XCode 7 once again. Same trouble. Any idea Solutionp

Positive 1805 pWe have been working on rebuilding our installer with WIX and Burn, using a custom bootstrapper application.  We are using a feature tree in our main MSI, and have set EnableFeatureSelectionyes so that we can replicate the feature tree in our custom BA UI and send those feature selections down to the MSI at planapply time.  This has all been working well until we started recently to test the upgrade process.  We have run into what appears to be an open bug in Burnp  pa hrefhttpwixtoolset.orgissues4616 relnofollowhttpwixtoolset.orgissues4616ap  pWhen we do a minor upgrade, the features that are already installed do not get upgraded...the originally installed code remains on the machine.  From the testing and investigation weve done, we believe its because Burn isnt passing REINSTALLALL to the MSI package which is what the above bug says.p  pWe found this question where Rob says you have to handle the OnPlanMsiFeature callback, which we are doing correctly.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions15394382wixpassoptiontomsiforrepairwix pass option to msi for repairap  pSince the above bug has been open since Dec 2014, we didnt have confidence that it would be fixed soon, so we decided that we would try to find a workaround.  What weve come up with so far is hackish at best, but at a proof of concept level, it shows some promise.  We are copying the entire MsiPackage node, giving the copy a new ID and adding a property with REINSTALLALL on it, like thisp  precode  ltMsiPackage  IdMSI     Cacheyes     Compressedno     DisplayInternalUIno     Vitalyes     Visibleyes     EnableFeatureSelectionyes     SourceFileltpath to MSIgtgt   ltMsiPackagegt     ltMsiPackage  IdMSIREINSTALL     Cacheyes     Compressedno     DisplayInternalUIno     Vitalyes     Visibleyes     EnableFeatureSelectionyes     SourceFileltpath to MSIgtgt      ltMsiProperty NameREINSTALL ValueALLgt   ltMsiPackagegt codepre  pThen, in our custom BA, we are using the DetectRelatedMsiPackage event to detect a minor upgrade.  And using that minor upgrade detection to set the RequestState for each MsiPackage to either Local or None inside our PlanPackageBegin event handler, like thisp  precode            if e.PackageId  MSI                              if Operation  RelatedOperation.MinorUpdate                                      e.State  RequestState.None                                  else                                      e.State  RequestState.Present                                            if e.PackageId  MSIREINSTALL                              if Operation  RelatedOperation.MinorUpdate                                      e.State  RequestState.Present                                  else                                      e.State  RequestState.None                               codepre  pWere hoping to have some guidance from others who have run into this error with upgrades in Burn with EnableFeatureSelection turned on.  Will our workaround do the job  Alternatively, is there a way to dynamically create an MsiProperty from the custom BA so we can create REINSTALLALL as needed  Does anyone have other ideas of how to workaround this issue that are cleaner andor more reliable  p  pIf you need more information, let me know.  Weve been working with WixBurn for a couple months now, so we know some things...but were not experts yet.  p

Negative 1805 pI am working on a project converting a spreadsheet application to a database solution.  A macro was written that takes screen shots of each page and pastes them into a PowerPoint presentation.  Because of the nice formatting options in Excel, the presentation looks very pretty.p  pThe problem Im having is that I havent ever seen an Access report that would be pretty enough to display to upper management.  I think the output still has to be a PowerPoint presentation.  It needs to look as close as possible to the original output.p  pI am currently trying to write some code to use a .pot presentation template and fill in the data programmatically.  Putting the data into a PowerPoint table has been tricky because the tables are not easy to manipulate.  For example, if a particular description is too long, I need to break into the next cell down wordwrap isnt allowed because I can only have emnem lines per page.p  pIs there a way to make an Access report pretty, am I headed down the right path, or should I just try to programmatically fill in the Excel spreadsheet and use the code that already exists there to produce the presentation  Id still need to figure out how to know when to break a line when using a nonmonospaced font, as the users are currently doing that manually when they enter the data in the spreadsheetp  pJason Z If I set it to wrap, and I already have emnem lines, it would make emnem1 or 2 lines on the slide, which is unacceptable.p  pDennis That article looks very good, I should be able to glean something from it.

Negative 1805 pIm working on a PHP CMS like project and Im trying to find out whats the most convenient way of dealing with the CRUD functionality in PHP.p  pThe CMS is programmed completely in procedural PHP no OOP  I know that many of you will not agree with this... and was designed keeping everything as simple and light as possible, as well as creating highly reusable functions and snippets of code.p  pThe CMS allows multiple modules to be installed  activated on needs basis. These modules describe different types of content so I will probably end up having something like pages, news, blogs just to name a few.p  pFor each of this content types I will have to create the CRUD operations and now Im trying to find the most convenient way to achieve this.p  pOne requirement would be that the form for each of these content types is contained in a single external file for both insert and edit and if there is some way to integrate server side input validation that would be a plus.p

Again this all works fine. p  pMy first attempt at sending the total due to the ModalPopup is as followsp  precodeprotected void lnkMakePaymentClickobject sender, EventArgs e       MakePayment is the actual ModalPopup control and total due is a public property     MakePayment.TotalDue  txtTotalDue.Text     mdlPopupPayment.Show  codepre  pThe problem with this is that when I click the link to show the ModalPopup the PageLoad event does not fire so I have no way to assign my property to a label inside the ModalPopup. I even attempted to use the session object but had the same issue.  I can not even make a trip to the database because I can not pass in a customer ID.  Any ideas I am a novice at Javascript and perfer a server side soultion but at this point I am willing to try anything. p  pThe MakePayment user control contains 3 asp textboxes. One for the user to input a payment amount, another for payment type, and a third for notes like check numbers. Also on the control there is an apply and cancel button. The parent control is a basic ascx page which is a data entry screen that contains the ModalPopupExtender and all html code to activate it. p

Negative 1805 pI have a class that has dependencies that Ive wired up with Ninject.  p  precodepublic interface IFoo   public class MyObject      [Inject]     IFoo myfoo  codepre  pIn the real implementation Im using property injection, but just to quickly illustrate, Ill inject on the field.  As I understand, instead of newing instances of MyObject, in order to get the dependencies to be properly injected, I need to use p  precodekernel.GetltMyObjectgt codepre  pThe thing Im stumbling on however is that MyObject will only be used in the context of a class library.

Given that, whats generally the most pragmatic way to approach surfacing a generic instance of a Ninject kernel to my class library so that instances of MyObject and other similar cases can be hydratedp  pMy first inclination is some sort of factory that internalizes a singleton kernelwhich the applications themselves have to hydrateinitialize by loading up a module.p  pSo in RandomService.csp  precodevar myKernel  NinjaFactory.Unleash var myobj  myKernel.GetltMyObjectgt myobj.foo codepre  pBefore I go too far down this path though, I need to do a sanity check to make sure that the thinking is sound or that there isnt some obvious other thing that Im missing.

Negative 1805 pLets say theres a Teacher object and that Teachers holds a list of Courses objects. The courses for the Teacher can change. Some get added, some get deleted. Whats the best approach to update this changes in the database. 1. Right after every change, update the database. e.g. A course get added, immediately add that into the database as well . 2. After all changes are made to the entityobject Teacher courses are added, courses are deleted, only then update the database with all the changes. 3. Others p  pI can see for both 1 and 2 advantages and disadvantages. For 1 I dont know how good it is when data models have direct access to the database.

Negative 1805 pIm implementing a interpreterlike project for which I need a strange little scheduling queue. Since Id like to try and avoid wheelreinvention I was hoping someone could give me references to a similar structure or existing work. I know I can simply instantiate multiple queues as I go along, Im just looking for some perspective by other people who might have better ideas than me p  pI envision that it might work something like this The structure is a tree with a single root. You get a kind of insertiterator to the root and then push elements onto it e.g. a and b in the example below. However, at any point you can also split the iterator into multiple iterators, effectively creating branches. The branches cannot merge into a single queue again, but you can start popping elements from the front of the queue again, using a kind of visitoriterator until empty branches can be discarded at your discretion.p  precode            x gt y gt z a gt b gt  g gt h gt i gt j              f gt b codepre  pAny ideas Seems like a relatively simple structure to implement myself using a pool of queues but Im following the think first, code later strategy p  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrong I thought Id add some extra background info. Its not relevant for the problem, but I thought it might help to clarify my objectives a bit. Very roughly the idea behind this structure is that it is basically used to scheduling computations... A branch can end in either a COMMIT or a ROLLBACK. If any of x  ..., g  ... or f  ... ends in a COMMIT, then p  precodea gt b codepre  pis executed in sequence as well as the branch that ended in COMMIT. E.g.p  precodex gt y gt z gt COMMIT codepre  pHowever, a  b will only be executed once when at least one of the branches are committed. If all three of the branches end in ROLLBACK then the entire tree is discarded including the initial events a  b.p  pThanks for the great answers so far Ill review them in detail as soon as I get home again.p

On the other hand, why put it if its just delegating work to the main constructor Logicwise, I wouldnt need to.p  pThe only point I see where itd be useful to explicitly define the contract in both constructors is if in the future we have Intelisense support for contracts. Would that happen, itd be useful to be explicit about which contracts each method has, as thatd appear in Intelisense.p  pAlso, are there any books around that go a bit deeper on the principles and usage of Design by Contracts One thing is having knowledge of the syntax of how to use Contracts in a language C, in this case, other is knowing how and when to use it. I read several tutorials and Jon Skeets C in Depth article about it, but Id like to go a bit deeper if possible.p  pThanksp

Negative 1805 pIve been reading about Webhooks and Im trying to determine if its a specification vs a stylepattern.p  pBy specification I mean that the implementation details, e.g. headers, payload and so on are well defined.  By style or pattern I mean in the sense that REST is a style as opposed to a spec or a pattern which describes usage but doesnt define implementation details.p  pFrom what I see, Webhooks is a stylepattern.  That the events which triggers the http callbacks are generated however the developer wants, and that the http callbacks have no specific implementation requirements except to be an http post.p  pIs this correctp

Negative 1805 pI have a model question, followed by a view question in a separate SO post, which I will link to when I create it.  Im making two posts so I can do two acceptances.  p  pNow, lets start by supposing that I have the following schema.  This is a simplified version of a real schema Im designing, with irrelevant columns ommitted.  Names have been changed to protect the innocent, and my job.p  pcodetreecode has the following attributes.p  precodetree.id tree.dob tree.height     tree.forestid codepre  pcodeforestidcode is a foreign key to the codeforestcode table, which is just a way to aggregate multiple codetreecode rows.  It has an codeidcode column and some metadata columns.p  pcodetreecode and codeforestcode both have potentially many codetreedatacode rows.  codetreedatacode containsp  precodetreedata.value treedata.treeid treedata.forestid codepre  ptreedata.treeid and treedata.forestid are constrained so that one of the two must be null.p  pIf tree.forestid is not null, then the relationship between treedata and tree is manytomany, and forest is the linker table.  Otherwise, the relationship between tree and treedata is one to many.  It is very important to my application that the user is able to group trees together into forests on the fly via the UI, and to set a treedata.value for the entire forest, but also be able to work with individual trees.  Now, I can think of a couple of ways to represent this.  One is to say that every tree has a forestid and is a forest of at least size 1.  Then, the relationship is always many to many.  Another is to provide a denormalized view along the lines of p  precodeselect tree., treedata.  from tree, treedata where tree.id  treedata.treeid  union  select tree., treedata., from tree, treedata where tree.forestid  treedata.forestid.   codepre  pYet a third way would be to have a codeforestidcode column in codetreecode and to drop the codeforestcode table entirely. Down that path I see a difficulty in getting ACID guarantees with respect to proper incrementing of codetree.forestidcode.  Theres also the possibility that forests should contain their own metadata.  Id love to hear more ways to represent this, and also to get the opinion of more seasoned database people with respect to which way is preferable, and top marks if you explain why you think so by citing examples from your own experience.p  pemResponse to Martin Doms suggestion of a TreeComposite tableemp  pThanks for your reply.  I wanted to give the suggestion of a TreeComposite a day to simmer before responding.  First of all, your way does model the relationship Im expressing in normal form, so yes, I think that you do understand the question.  However, I think I made a silly mistake by naming my tables Tree and Forest because Forests dont need to be recursively composable  into each other.  They arent computer science trees.  Theyre just barkandtwig trees.  The parentid model, though it still represents what I need in normal form its a generalization of what I need, and though it has the advantage that Trees and Forests are the same thing now, which is on the surface a complexity win, I fear that in the soil it would be a tangled mess.p  pThe problem is that whether or not theyre called the same thing in my model, theyre not not the same thing to my controller or view.  E.G., a TreeComposite with child nodes will probably have at least attribute for which each node will have a distinct value. In that case, I need to use a different widget in my view to display multiple values for the attribute.  Put another way,I need to be able to display each TreeComposite that is its own parent as a single row, and what that row looks like depends on whether the TreeComposite has children.p  pSo the first thing I have to do after I extract a TreeComposite from my model is decide whether its really a Tree or a Forest.  Why do that, when I can store it in normal form as Tree and Forest directly, thereby making my View and Controllers simpler without hurting my model  Searching for TreeData is also complicated by the parentchild relationship.  I have to connect through N number of TreeComposites until I find the root node, and then search for TreeData pointing at the root node.  This shreds data locality.  Meanwhile, if I have a Tree with a ForestID, and I want that Trees data, I never need to look at the Forest table at all.  I can do a direct foreignkey lt foreignkey join to TreeData.  codewhere Tree.ForestID  TreeData.ForestIDcode.p

Negative 1805 pI need the ability in C code to logoff the console user when call from an administrator process or if it is called by that user and maybe a windows service in the future. The issue I am running into is that ExitWindowsEx will only logoff the user that calls it. If an administrator process calls a logoff the console user is unaffected. The only application that I know of that can do this is psShutdown.exe, except that psShutdown can only be run by the administrator. Does anyone know in C how to identify the console user and then do a logoff against that user What is the magic inside psShutdown Im looking for something that works in WindowsXP and up. Also I cannot use WMI because some machines are running windows Embeded and do not have WMI.p  pThe reason psShutdown.exe must be run as administrator is because it installs a service and a normal user does not have the rights to do this.p

Event subscribers declare a service operation with the event type they want to handle and wrap that in a generic message contract class. This generic message class uses the message code attributes to use the eventpublisher xml names  which is a single message structure. All event subscribers are registered in UDDI and the pubsub mechanism use those endpoints to push events to the subscribers. Registration of service operations in UDDI detect the specific eventnamespace to register those service operations as event handlers and not reqresponse operations.p

Negative 1805 pSo I dropped the standard WPF codeCalendarcode control on the MainWindow.xaml in a brand new WPF App in VS2010.  If I click on a day in the calendar and then try to click the Close button for the app, I have to click twice on the close button before it accepts the click.  Its acting as if the codeCalendarcode hasnt released the Mouse to interact with the rest of the application.p  pIve changed codeFocusablecode to false, with no change in effect, and Ive tried overriding the codePreviewOnMouseUpcode and calling codeReleaseMouseCapturecode to no avail.  Ive done the same thing with codeMouseLeavecode and codeMouseLeftButtonUpcode with the same result.  Given that none of those things are working I suspect Im barking up the wrong tree.

Negative 1805 pIm using jQuery with PhoneGap building an iPad app. p  pI have built a modal window using an absolutely positioned div that I animate into place using codewebkittransform translate3d0,80px,0codep  pWithin this div I have a simple menu consisting of a UL with each LI floated left.p  pIve added this jQuery to it to allow the selected item to be highlightedp  precodevar optionsPlayers  optionlistplayers li optionsPlayers.clickfunction       optionsPlayers.filter.selected.removeClassselected     this.addClassselected     players  this.index  1      codepre  pThis all works as intended, except that when I click one of the LIs, I also get this very weird screen glitch where it appears that the modal DIV looses positioning for a second then comes back. You see this flicker where it appears the modal is shifting to the left of the screen and back again. p  pThis happens in both the simulator and the iPad 2 itself. p  pIm going to start dismantling it all piece by piece to see if I can find what the culprit is, but thought Id also ask in here in case theres a known issue involving jQuery events and PhoneGap in this manner p  pUPDATEp  pa hrefhttpwww.flickr.comphotosaustinfamily5879607156 relnofollowHeres a short video of it in operationa so you can see the weird flickerp  pUPDATE 2p  pI went ahead and swapped out a jquery .click for a .bindtouchstart...p  pAs expected, it feels a bit more responsive, but I still get the exact same weird screen redrawflicker. p  pUPDATE 3 SOLUTION Found it Adding answer below...p

Negative 1805 pThe example Im hitting is that Im attempting to update a record in a database and I get a violation of a unique value constraint. The text of the message has the name of the constraint and the value that is duplicated. In principle, I could parse the text of the message to extract this information. But I hate to do that, because text processing like that has a tendency to add ambiguities. Like, the value is enclosed in parentheses. But if I search the text for parentheses, what if parentheses occur somewhere else in the message, like someone created a constraint name with parentheses in it or some such What if future releases of the DB engine change the wording or format of the message Etc. So is this information available in cleanlydefined fieldsp  pSpecifically Im using VB.Net but I presume any answer would apply to .Net in general.p

Negative 1805 pI am currently trying to port a c program that deals with datagram udp packets to some higherlevel language.

So is something like peeking at the datagram or determining its complete length beforehand possible in higherlevel languages like python or javap

Negative 1805 pI have created a jar file of my application so that users can run it from Windows Explorer. It loads a JSON file in its own working directory for some settings using the path .config.json. However, when I run it from the jar file from Windows Explorer, it cannot find the config file, while running the same jar from the command line works.

Negative 1805 pI am following up to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq102115591238040this questiona, where there is an asynchronous request to draw a route from point A to B, called codesetDirectionscode.

Negative 1805 pI upgraded to Nhibernate 3.2.0.4000 and fluent 1.3.0.717 using Nuget.  Mappings that used to work are now causing me an issue when I try to save.  The data loads up fine, but when I try to change any boolean values, they are ignored.  I can save text fields without any problem.  In fact, I can alter a text field and boolean value in one save, and it only actually saves the text field change into the database.p  pFirst, I have an options objectp  precodepublic class Options      public virtual long OptionsId  get set       private IListltMobileOptionsgt MobileGatewayList  get set        public virtual MobileOptions MobileGateway              get                      if MobileGatewayList  null                 return null              return MobileGatewayList.FirstOrDefault                 codepre  pAnd for Mobile specific options I have a classp  precodepublic class MobileOptions      public virtual long MobileOptionsId  get set       public virtual Options Options  get set       public virtual SharedGatewayOptions SharedGatewayOptions  get set   codepre  pcodeSharedGatewayOptionscode is a class of shared options for all my subsets of options I have 3, but am only showing mobile to keep this example concise.  Specifically, where I noticed the error was in the boolean flag to enable the mobile portion of my application.p  precodepublic class SharedGatewayOptions      public virtual bool GatewayActivated  get set   codepre  pThe mapping of the mobile options in my main options class map options looks like thisp  precodeHasManyltMobileOptionsgtReveal.MemberltGatewayOptionsgtMobileGatewayList             .KeyColumnOptionsId             .Cascade.All codepre  pI had to use a hasmany because the table containing the mobile options contains the parent Id, but the parent does not contain a column to the child table.  There is no FK relationship in the database, and I could not get a HasOne to work.p  pHere is the mapping in the MobileOptions classmapp  precodeReferencesltGatewayOptionsgtx gt x.Options, OptionsId  Componentx gt x.SharedGatewayOptions, y gt       y.Mapx gt x.GatewayActivated, ActivateGateway.Generated.Insert  codepre  pWhen I create a new options record and mobile options, this all works fine and it is set up with the defaults.  But when I go to change the activation boolean or any other boolean there is no error and nothing is saved back to the database.  However, on another child options much like the codeMobileOptionscode when I save a text field and a boolean field, only the text field changes.p  pMy code for changing the bit looks like thisp  precodepublic void ToggleGatewaysToggleGatewaysRequest request      var options  GetOptionsnew GatewayOptionsRequest  SiteId  request.SiteId       options.RemoteGateway.SharedGatewayOptions.GatewayActivated  request.RemoteGatewayActivated      optionsRepository.Saveoptions  codepre  pThis code used to work, but since the upgrade it doesnt work anymore.  I traced through it and the object is being changed in memory, but then on the next request, the object is reverted.  I have stepped through the code to see if on the next request I am somehow causing the bit to flip back, and that is not the case.  The database is never toughed.  Its as if the newest fluent no longer knows how to map boolean  bit on a save.p

Negative 1805 pI am currently working on a program that utilizes RSSI to determine location based on signal strength. Does anybody know where a working java example is of trilateration I couldnt find any online. p  pThe program will basically need to take in 3 distances, which are the distances derived from the RSSIs and then the latitude and longitude of the three points and then determine the users location using 2 dimensional trilateration Im ignoring the height of each beacon for now. p  pI saw a Python one on here, but I dont know Python well enough to understand it.p

Negative 1805 pFor this wordpresssite a hrefhttpbit.lyNlBv9I relnofollowhttpbit.lyNlBv9Ia I use sliding doors for the rounded corners and cufon for the font.

It first appears when the user clicks on the account li under authenticated and disappears either when the user clicks on the li again or mouses out. The navigation div has its height set to 40px in the css, so I thought it might be a positioning problem like in the linked question, but setting the height to auto didnt fix it, and I cant take the account container out of the navigation bar because that will mess up its positioning.

Negative 1805 pIm in need of recording video from a 4 channel DVR from .net C. Ive looked at EMGU a Opencv .net wrapper as well as the DirectShow .net library to do this. Ive decided to give EMGU a go and is quite happy with it when using webcams. Now I want to use a 4 channel H.264 Usb DVR for the same purpose, but I dont know how to select a video channel on the DVR. When running the sample capture application of EMGU I only get a black screen. I have the same problem with DirectShow. It picks up the DVR as a DR 31013104 Video Capture device, but is also showing me the black screen. Note that the camera is working fine, when I use SuperDVRsoftware that came included with the DVR.p  pI think there must be a way to specify the channel of which camera you want in both of these libraries, but I have no idea. Could someone shed some light on my problem please. p

Negative 1805 pIm trying to create a domain model that supports localization. Ive looked at some SO questions that were asked before but I did not really like the solutions proposed. For example, in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1668033localizedtablesandentityframeworkthis questiona I think its an overkill to create an additional entity for each and every entity that should support localized data. Id rather have the localized data for all of my entities be in one entity whose sole purpose is to hold the localized data. p  pMy proposed solution is as followsp  ol lipCreate a codeLocalizedEntitycode class from which all of the entities that should support localization would inherit.pli lipCreate a codeLocalizedDatacode entity which will basically hold the actual localized values by culture.pli ol  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  precodepublic class LocalizedEntity      public String Code  get set    public enum ResourceType      CityName,     CityDescription,     StreetName,     AreaName     others...   public class LocalizedData      public Int32 Id  get set      public String Code  get set      public ResourceType Type  get set      public Int32 CultureId  get set      public String Value  get set    public class City  LocalizedEntity      public Int32 Id  get set      public virtual ICollectionltAreagt Areas  get set      others  codepre  pAccordingly, the business layer will fetch the localized entity, and then go and get its localized value from the codeLocalizedDatacode entity by codeCodecode and codeResourceTypecode. And of course, in order to avoid many roundtrips to the database, some caching could be appropriate.p  pYour thoughtsp

Negative 1805 pI have quite a bewildering problem.br Im using a big C library for handling some proprietary protocol over UDP on Windows XP7. It listens on one port throughout the run of the program, and waits for connections from distant peers.p  pMost of the time, this works well. However, due to some problems Id experienced, Ive decided to add a simple debug print directly after the call to codeWSARecvFromcode the win32 function used in the library to recv datagrams from my socket of interest, and tell what IP and port they came from.br Strangely enough, in some cases, Ive discovered packets are dropped at the strongOS levelstrong i.e. I see them in Wireshark, they have the right dstport, all checksums are correct  but they never appear in the debug prints Ive implanted into the code.p  pNow, Im fully of the fact people tend to mention a bit too often that UDP doesnt guarantee delivery  but this is not relevant, as the packets strongarestrong received by the machine  I see them in Wireshark.br Also, Im familiar with OS buffers and the potential to fill up, but here comes the weird part...p  pIve done some research trying to find out which packets are dropped exactly. What Ive discovered, is that all dropped packets share two things in common though emsomeem, but definitely not emmostem, of the packets that emarentem dropped share these as wellp  ol liThey are small. Many of the packets in the protocol are large, close to MTU  but all packets that are dropped are under 100 bytes gross.li liThey are always one of two a SYNequivalent i.e. the first packet a peer sends to us in order to initiate communications or a FINequivalent i.e. a packet a peer sends when it is no longer interested in talking to us.li ol  pCan either one of these two qualities affect the OS buffers, and cause packets to be randomly or even more interesting  selectively droppedbr Any light shed on this strange issue would be very appreciated.p  pMany thanks.p  hr  pstrongEDIT 241012strongp  pI think I may have missed an important detail. It seems that the packets dropped before arrival share something else in common They and Im starting to believe, emonlyem they are sent to the server by new peers, i.e. peers that it stronghasnt tried to contact beforestrong.p  pFor example, if a synequivalent packet arrives from a peer weve never seen before, it will not be seen by codeWSARecvFromcode. However, if we have sent a synequivalent packet to that peer strongourselvesstrong even if it didnt reply at the time, and now it sends strongusstrong a synequivalent, we will see it.p  p Im not sure whether this is a empeerem we havent seen i.e. ipport or just a emportem we havent seen before.p  pDoes this helpbr Is this some kind of WinSock option Ive never heard of as I stated above, the code is not mine, so it may be using socket options Im not aware ofp  pThanks againp

Negative 1805 pIm working on A pathfinding for a grid based topdown game. The issue Ive came across is probably easiest to understand in the image below. Asterisks are playersNPCs. The yellow asterisk is the current NPC that wants to path to the X. The red asterisks are NPCs that in this case are obstacles. Yellow cells are walls, white cells are floor. While the entire path to the goal is indeed unreachable, Im still wanting to get a path to the next best location in this case, spot numbered 8.p  pI can easily have it path around obstacles, but not sure how to do exactly as I describe. If I stop it once its hit an obstacle, it doesnt perform properly by stopping at 3. If I repath to the tile in the closed list with the lowest distance from the end goal, if the end goal is on the other side of a wall as an example it can mess things up quite bad as well.p  pAny suggestions I feel like Im missing something otherwise obvious, so please forgive an idiocy here.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com5UzvT.png altenter image description herep  pThanks, Timp

Negative 1805 pProblem looks like thisp  pI am a Python developer for approx 2 years, but I should mention that I integrate with Postgresql mainly via Sqlalchemy. Although I know how to write basic queries and instructions I am not very experienced.p  pSo, I started new work recently  upgrading existing website. But there seems to be a query problem. Imagine a table actions and when i hitp  precodeselect  from actions where ownerid  2 codepre  pit shall return all actions for the particular owner, but to my suprise it does not. For now i am only seeing actions i performed today. To make it more interesting I am using the same database structure in a developer version and there everything works fine.p  pSo my solution was that I connected to production db via pgadmin and checked everything. First all the records are in the database to my suprise, althouth they are not returned to users. Second The only difference between production and test versions is in sequence, which looks like thisp  precodeCREATE SEQUENCE actionidseq  INCREMENT 1  MINVALUE 1  MAXVALUE 9223372036854775807  START 89  CACHE 1  CYCLE ALTER TABLE actionidseq OWNER TO databaseuser GRANT ALL ON TABLE actionidseq TO public GRANT ALL ON TABLE actionidseq TO databaseuser codepre  pIn test version was created without thouse GRANTs of course for another datbase user.p  pSo finally my question could this be a problem . Or mayble sqlalchemy is the problem p

Negative 1805 pIm navigating from one view controller to the next using a segue modal. However I am using a custom segue so that no animation is involved when the transition happens. Instead i have my own animation on the subviews inside the view controller view. Everything works fine here.

And when the codedismissModalViewControllerAnimatedcode is called, even if the device is in landscape orientation the whole view rotates  to come to the landscape view again.  p  pIs there any way to change the orientation stored of the parent view controller to landscape before I dismiss the modal view controllerp  pOr am I doing anything wrong in implementing my custom animationp

Negative 1805 pI am trying to write a Mathematica script that can interpolate a discrete vector field to a continuous vector field.  I then want to extract the integral curves field lines from the continuous vector field.  p  pI know that Mathematicas codeListStreamPlotcode function can visually present integral curves however, I need the actual points that comprise them.p  pI have considered writing a bruteforce method to the following effect It seems that the integral curve could be determined recursively.  If a point were picked in the list, then the next point in the integral curve would be that with the closest slope.  Each point is actually a vector, and thus each has its own slope.  There are only 4 candidates for the next point  up, down, left, or right of the current point.  The next point would then become the new starting point, and the process would recurse until the edge of the grid is reached.  p  pHowever, I wonder if there is a simpler method using Mathematicas higherlevel functions.  I also dont know if my method is even conceptually correct.p  pI would really appreciate any thoughts or suggestions on this task. p  pThanksp

Negative 1805 pMy asp .net application is facing issue where logged out users are using browsers backbutton to revisit previously accessed page. User cannot perform any server side events , but it would be much better if user are not allowed to view this page at all. I searched for a solution to stop this  but most of the solution include writing code inside page that must be not be revisited like this one.p  precode protected override void OnPreRenderEventArgs e                      base.OnPreRendere             string sb             sb  ltscript languagejavascriptgtn             sb  window.history.forward1n             sb  nltscriptgt             ClientScript.RegisterClientScriptBlockPage.GetType, clientScript, sb          codepre  pThis means that i will have to write code in every page that a loggedin user can visit . Is there a better way to handle this issue Im expecting an optimized solution whereby I will not have to write code in every page .  Help will be much appreciated. p

Negative 1805 pI would like some advice on how to use Git locally on my computer along with Visual Studio and a TFS server. Unfortunately the technical leader of my company has set TFS with the strongexclusive checkoutstrong policy and so every time someone checks out a file, it cant be edited by someone else.br What is the right way to make the two systems live togetherbr I would try to use emGitTFem but Im not convinced with the checkin phase. The workflow should be as the followingp  ol liclone the projectli liswitch to offline mode for Visual Studioli liwork offline with Gitli lifetch from the TFS server and rebaseli liemcheckinemli ol  pThe problem is how do I checkin my files if someone else has already checked out the files I need to change How does GitTF really work when checkingin filesp  pAnother workflow that came to my mind, without GitTF, could be the followingp  ol liopen the TFS projectli liswitch to offline modeli licreate a new branch with Gitli liwork on the branchli lireturn to the master branch, update itli liexclusively checkout the files which have been changed on my Git branchli limerge the branch on masterli liemcheck in with TFS after switch to online modeemli ol  pWhat do you recommendp  pThank youbr Lucap

Negative 1805 pRegarding source maps, I came across a strange behavior in chromium build 181620. In my app Im using minified jquery and after loggingin, I started seeing HTTP requests for jquery.min.map in server log file. Those requests were lacking cookie headers all other requests were fine. Those requests are not even exposed in net tab in Developer tools which doesnt bug me that much.p  pThe point is, js files in this app are only supposed to be available to loggedin clients, so in this setup, the source maps either wont work or Id have to change the location of source map to a public directory.p  pMy question is is this a desired behavior meaning  source map requests should not send cookies or is it a bug in Chromiump

This gets the return of the LINQ statement later.p  precodestatic ListltJobPropertiesgt SortedList  jobList codepre  pI then used the following statement to give codeSortedListcode a sorted codejobListcode that should be sorted first by codeArrivalTimecode and then by codeCPUCycleTimecode.p  precodeSortedList  jobList.OrderByo gt o.ArrivalTime.ThenByo gt o.CPUCycleTime.ToList codepre  pInstead of getting what I expected, I got the following.p  precode1 3 10 2 4 15 3 6 8 4 7 3 5 9 12 codepre  pIf this question was not clear enough or the formatting not pleasant, please tell me and I will edit in the clarifications and adjust the formatting. Thanks for any help.p  h2EDITh2  pI want to implement a Shortest Job Next sorting. Job 1 will arrive at time 3. There are no other jobs at time 3 so it uses its CPUCycleTime of 10. While it was being processed, jobs 25 were put in the waiting queue. So, now those four jobs must be sorted in order of shortest CPUCycleTime. Going by the above codeinput.txtcode, job 4 should come next, then 3, 5, and 2.p

Negative 1805 pI have a situation where I have nested divs. I have a parent div that has an onclick event and a few divs inside that are being dynamically populated.  Im given to understand that through bubbling, the onclick event should propagate up through the DOM, triggering the onclick event in all parents.  All of the research I have done has shown a bunch of people who are trying to PREVENT this, whereas I cant get it to work.  The only way I can get the onclick to work, is to click near the edges of the div, presumably where the child divs dont exist, and Im clicking directly on the parent.p  pIve included the applicable code below.  There can be as many as 9 of these, socalled widgets on the page, but I have removed all code except that referencing the first widget.p  pUpdate When I try to pull everything out of the JavaScript function, and put it directly in to the HTML code, it works as I would expect. However, doing this would force me to drop desired functionality, so Im going to try to avoid that workaround.p  pThere is a new fiddle below that shows essentially what Im going for, even though the events are not calling the JS functions as I would expect.p  pUpdate 2 I have created a fiddle 5 below that mimics the response Im seeing in the code.  When using the fiddle, youll notice that no alert is given when clicking in the center of the div, but when you click near the outer boundaries of the div, you finally get a response.p  pPROBLEM SOLVEDp  pPer Racheets answer below, this problem has been solved.

I figured out srcmain... resources are loaded instead of srctest...p  pDo anyone know what happend I can get it working just by renaming the test specific resources but I am curious why the loader  changed precendence to load main over test.

Negative 1805 pIve a ViewController which Contains a segmented Control.p  pEach Segmented Control has his own View Controller. Technically I initiate a ViewController for each Segmented Control and display the View to display, and hide the other views.p  pThis works all good, but now I tried to display a MFMailComposer with presentModalViewController. That I clearly need to do on the ViewController where the Segmented Control is on it, because from the other ViewControllers I only put the view above the segmented Control.p  pThe MFMailComposer appears and disappears, but after disappearing the complete App rotated 180. I only support one Orientation, the 180 rotation isnt supported by the plist.p  pWhat I did wrongp

As such, the rows get nice highlighting, the columns can be sorted, and theres a search box at the top of the table. All nice stuff.p  pThe problem is that the page, as a whole, is a bit slow to load. It seems that half of the loading time is the raw displaying of data fetching data then iterating over all the records generating the basic codeHTMLcode table. The second half of the loading time or at least a decent chunk of the time looks to be devoted to converting the regular table into a codedataTablecode. p  pIm wondering if theres anything I can do to speed this whole process up. Ive tried using pagination on the codedataTablecode but that seems to be useless since all the records are loaded anyway, just hidden across multiple codedataTablecode pages. Real pagination for the whole page isnt really possible given the nature of the app. I feel like the queries arent going to get any faster so theres got to be optimization or some trick to make this page load faster.p  pAny thoughtsp  pThanks for the helpp  pemstrongEditemstrong Im referring to this dataTable plugin a hrefhttpdatatables.netindex relnofollowhttpdatatables.netindexap

In the first 8 SCL cycles, the SDA bus was what I expected, 7bit slave address and 1bit Read.

The gyro never lowers the SDK to low to ACK the master.p  pI bought the product recently, so I dont think there is a problem with it. Im guessing the master never release the SDA bus to check an ACK to begin with. What am I missing herep
Negative 1805 pMy PC is Windows 7 64bit Im on the U.S. East coast Eastern Time the Date and Time applet  reached by rightclicking on the taskbar clock and choosing Adjust datetime  labels my time zone UTC0500 Eastern Time U.S. amp Canada and tells me that Daylight Savings Time ends in November.  For those coming along later, this was written in April, after we did the spring forward to get to Daylight Savings Time.p  pCalling either the Windows GetTimeZoneInformation or GetDynamicTimeZoneInformation APIs the latter only available on Vista or later returns a bias value of 300 minutes, 5 hours.  The bias value is not negative because the doc for that value says UTC  local time  bias.p  pBut if I go to the a hrefhttpwwp.greenwichmeantime.cominfoiso.htm relnofollowISO web site that claims to show me the time on my computera it displays a time that matches a clock but ends 0400.  I tried to copypaste it but its difficult as it changes every second.  Typing current time utc into Google shows a time that is also 4 not 5 hours ahead of the clock time here.p  pConfusing me a bit more  I have an EC2 instance running Windows Server 2008 that someone else set up and said was intentionally set to GMT so that times recorded based on the server clock wouldnt have 1hour jumps caused by Daylight Savings Time.p  pWhen I connect to that server, it shows a time 5 hours ahead of what I see here.  But its DateTime applet in Control Panel different from Windows 7 shows that the current time zone is GMT Greenwich Mean Time Dublin, Edinburgh, Lisbon, London but there is also a time zone GMT Coordinated Universal Time  UTC  and if I change the time zone to that something I think is correct, the offset is 4 hours.  p  pThe Time Zone Settings dialog on Windows 7 reached by clicking the Change time zone... button on the Date and Time applet discussed above has time zones labelled UTC Coordinated Universal Time 4 hours from now and UTC Dublin, Edinburgh, Lisbon, London 5 hours from now.p  pOther than thinking that the EC2 instance had its time zone set wrong  it should have been set to UTC not London time to accomplish the goal stated above  I am not any further along in understanding this.  Windows 7 in the U.S. says Im 5 hours from UTC everything else including Windows 2008 set to UTC time says 4 hours.p  pSo what should a routine do to produce an ISOstyle timestamp with a trailing timezone offset  The Windows API tells me it should be 0500, but everything else says it should be 0400.

Negative 1805 pI have a custom output class that has two codestdostreamcode members that serve different purposes.  Either stream is used depending upon how the output class is configured.  In some instances, the two streams are chained together.  A grossly simplified version of the class is below.

Negative 1805 pI am making a horizontal side scroll game in which the objective of the player is to get as far as he possibly can in the game. In order to play the game, the player will have to jump over objects placed on the ground rocks. He will also have to destroy objects ice that are hanging from the top of the stage by shooting an object a ball for now at these ice objects. I have managed to make the jumping part of the game work, I am having difficulties however in trying to make the player destroy the ice objects.p  pThe ice objects are Movieclips being placed in a container on the stage using a for loop and some math randoms. The player can shoot an object at these ice objects to destroy them. I created a function that is activated when the ball of the player hits the ice objects. Both of the objects will dissappear upon hit and should be removed from the container. This function does appear to remove both the ice object that is hit and the ball that the player shot from the stage. However both objects are still in the container, you just cant see them.

Negative 1805 pI am involved in a new project that is using scrum and has scaled from one scrum team to four and will probably grow further. Its a new technology so the architecture is still evolving, so the pieceparts need to be system tested as a whole. Using the car analogy we have teams for chassis, brakes, engine, and steering. Any given story has a focus eg faster acceleration and is assigned to one team eg engine. The definition of done usually defines criteria wrt that piece in that scrum. However some testing still needs to be done of the system eg drive the car around the track to make sure changes didnt break other parts of the system. Eg the engine may be heavier which affected the braking or steering. p  pa hrefhttpthescrumblog.blogspot.com201105scalingscrumdone.html relnofollowHerea points out that a separate test team is NOT the answer. It lists separate test team first in their top five issues when scaling scrum. So the system testing must be handled with the scrum structure.p  pShould the definition of done which drives the test criteria include the entire system so all teams do full regression test of all areas or just their focus area eg the brake teams regression test of some other story is what discovers the impact the changed engine had. There seems to be a tradeoff between duplication and coverage. We would like to avoid scrumfall eg adding another stage of testing, avoid duplication, yet still discover issues as quickly and close to source as possible. p  pHow does system test scale as a project grows to multiple scrum teamsp
Negative 1805 pI am learning Quick Sort.  I know that Quick Sort performs badly when the pivot value does an unbalanced partition , and so first element or last element is not a good choice because if the list is almost sorted the partition would be unbalanced.p  pAs i searched i found 2 optionsp  pOne was to choose a pivot randomly between emlowemlowest index and emupemhighest index.It seems a safe option but random number generators are time consuming.p  pSecond would be to take the median of all the elements.

Negative 1805 pSorry for asking a question which I think I know the answer to but it just seems so weird to me it cant be correct. p  pIf I have a templated function p  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt int TemplatedSizeT ampref     return sizeofref  codepre  pand I instantiate it with a string literal like thisp  precodeint i  TemplatedSizeoh how I love C sometimes codepre  pwhat I get stamped out by template instantiation would be a function taking a reference to an array of const char with a length of 28 I looked up the syntax for that and I must say I have never seen it in code before.

Negative 1805 pIn Eclipse, I load up an Android Virtual Device, and then once its loaded and not at the lock screen, I hit Debug on the Eclipse toolbar.  My app runs fine barring any errors from the last edit cycle, but thats what debugging is for.  However, after I try to end my app by hitting the back button from the main [only] activity  I have implemented a call to finish as the last line of onBackPressed , even though on further research it appears that hitting the back button from the main activity implicitly calls finish , it appears to not end the app.p  pThe Eclipse debug perspectives Debug pane still shows the followingp  precodeMyAppName [Android application]  DalvikVM[localhost8619]      Thread [lt1gt main] Running   Thread [lt10gt Binder2] Running   Thread [lt9gt Binder1] Running codepre  pI am assuming the DalvikVM line is the emulator.  I do not knowingly spin up any extra threads in my app light enough computations, so far, that I just do them all in the UI thread on button clicks, etc, so I have no idea whatsoever where Binder1 and Binder2 came from.p  pAlso, when I go to debug again, thinking the app was fully shut down, the tooltip on the debug icon is Debug MyAppName already running.p  pDoes finish not terminate the application when it comes to Eclipses debug hooks  Or, is there some other method I should call from the main activity that behaves like a terminate, that tells Android that not only the activity, but the whole app, is finishedp  pYes, I am aware that Android apps processes are not immediately killed when running on the device during the normal life cycle.  I realize that I dont want to make my app kill its process stone cold dead when it comes to the shipped version.  However, if this is the cause of the persistent debugger tiein, I would at least like to implement something like codeifDEBUGMODE trulyExitcode , either by teaching Eclipse to autokill after a finish somehow, or by implementing some sort of trulyExit in my main activity, to only be used during debugging.  So, if I could get a few tips on how to teach Eclipse, or how one would implement a codetrulyExitcode, thatd be awesome.p  pMy workaround currently is closing the emulator each time.

Negative 1805 pWhat is the best way to use multiple dynamic PHP Mysqli connectionsp  pCurrently I have a single MySQL server. All my data is on this server in a few databases. But in the not too distant future my storage needs will be larger than this server can handle. So what I will probably have to do is place some databases on one server and some on another. And in the further future probably more servers will come into play.p  pIn an effort of future proving my scripts I thought that a class to point to the right server might be the best solution. I just send a key of the data I want to get and it says what connection I should be using because it is stored on that server. For instance if I want to get some logs I send the key logs and the class says I will need to use the predefined connection connectionA.p  pThe class currently looks something likep  precodeClass DatabaseConnection      public connectionname      function constructkey         ifkeylogs             connectionname  connectionA                  elseifkeyuserdetails             connectionname  connectionB                codepre  pSo what I do now isp  precodeconnectionA  new mysqlidbhosta, dbusera, dbpassa, dbnamea connectionB  new mysqlidbhostb, dbuserb, dbpassb, dbnameb  databaseConnection  new DatabaseConnectionlogs sql  SELECT  FROM something WHERE timestampgt12378912798 result  databaseConnectiongtconnectionnamegtquerysql codepre  pThis works fine. Although it isnt as dynamic as I wish it was. I mainly run into problems when functions are concerned. But that required me to dop  precodefunction something     global connectionA, connectionB      databaseConnection  new DatabaseConnectionlogs     sql  SELECT  FROM something WHERE timestampgt12378912798     result  databaseConnectiongtconnectionnamegtquerysql  codepre  pOR p  precodefunction something     databaseConnection  new DatabaseConnectionlogs     global databaseConnectiongtconnection      sql  SELECT  FROM something WHERE timestampgt12378912798     result  databaseConnectiongtconnectionnamegtquerysql  codepre  pNeither are very elegant and the first one is quite some work if I add more connections or shuffle things around.p  pSo I thought about doing something like thisp  precodeClass DatabaseConnection      public connectionname      function constructkey         ifkeylogs             connectionname  connectionA                  elseifkeyuserdetails             connectionname  connectionB                    function connection         thisgtthisgtconnectionname           function connectionA         connectionA  new mysqlidbhosta, dbusera, dbpassa, dbnamea         return connectionA           function connectionB         connectionB  new mysqlidbhostb, dbuserb, dbpassb, dbnameb         return connectionB       codepre  pAnd using it likep  precodedatabaseConnection  new DatabaseConnectionlogs sql  SELECT  FROM something WHERE timestampgt12378912798 result  databaseConnectiongtconnectiongtquerysql codepre  pBut there are functions in certain scripts that are run a few hundred times each time the script runs. Inserts and stuff. So wouldnt this open 300 connections or something like thatp  pMy knowledge of Mysqli is too limited to fully the consequences of this approach. I read somewhere that Mysqli pools connections together so if a scripts runs a function for the first time it uses a set of credentials to login to serverA, and it tries to do it again in the same script a few moments later, it doesnt actually creates a new connection but uses the same one. Am I right or mixing things upp  pWhat do you think is the best way to address my need of dynamically saying what server should be contacted for what sort of data Or do you have another good ideap

Negative 1805 pIm currently facing a problem concerning the implementation of an Object Pool pattern Im trying to build with Cocoa.p  pMy classs basic behaviour is as follows p  ul lia client object requests an object  the object is reused from an not in use objects collection if available the class instantiates a new one otherwise, put into an in use collection and returned to the clientli lia client object is done using the object  the object is put into an not in use collection and removed from the in use collectionli ul  pThe thing is I use a dictionary containing arrays for the not in use collection and somehow, objects get deallocd and set to nil while theyre in the arrays thus making my app crash...p  pIve been trying to debug this for hours and still I have no clue about what is causing this bug...p  pAm I missing something here Should I take more care about something in particular concerning retainreleaseautorelease callsp  pPS Im not using ARCp  pThats in advance for your answers and since Im french, excuse my english p

Negative 1805 pLet me explain. Im developing a javascript application to help people develop websites. I wont explicitly go into what it does, just know that it works by superimposing its htmlinline css interface over the website thats being developed and offers a variety of tools such as tracing images and code minifiers.p  pI have it stored on a server as a .js file. All people have to do to access my application is copy and paste a small bit of html onto their page to use it, like thisp  precodeltscript srchttpajax.googleapis.comajaxlibsjquery1.10.2jquery.min.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srcwww.example.comapplication.jsgt ltdiv classapplicationgtltdivgt codepre  pThe html and inline css of the interface is then inserted into the application div using jquerys .html function.p  pIt all works perfectly. p  pApart from one thing. The load time. As a user develops their site they will be continually refreshing their page, and this results them having to wait about 3 seconds very annoying as time goes on for the applications interface to load.p  pOf course, if the browsers cache is turned on, the problem dissappears, but if youre developing a site youre going to want to have your cache disabled Its a conundrum.p  pThen I thought to use local storage objects to hold strings of the interface svg graphics, and then .html these strings into inline css. Its an elabourate workaround, but only developers would use this tool. It isnt an end user thing. And it works beautifully too, but the thing is, the browser still needs to download the script inorder to know to access the locally stored images Processor speed isnt bottlenecking it, its bandwidth.p  pSo I was thinking storing the script itself in a local storage object, and having a tiny initialisation script to run it.p  pThe initialisation script would simply retrieve the script from the local stroage object as a string, parse it accordingly strongand then run it.strongp  pstrongTo reiterate my question, running it is the part I cant do I can insert the script onto the page via .htmlscript, but then how do I go about running itstrongp

Negative 1805 pI have a single codeconfigServicecode in my AngularJS project that fetches some configuration values  of the whole project from the server via an ajax request, i.e. like whether or not users need to be moderated before their account is activated.p  pTo display information according to the configuration, the whole first page load should be deferred until this ajax request completed. My service looks likep  precodeangular.moduleclientApp.factoryconfigService, function http      var configService       var conf        Object.definePropertyconfigService, serverConfig,          get function               return conf                    http.getapiconfig.successfunction data          conf  .extendconf, data           return configService  codepre  pSo, since the service is a singleton, this will only be executed one time when the page loads, not on every route change.p  pNow I know how to use codeqcode and promises, but my problem is how can defer the execution of ALL of angular until this service has finished its request Most of my views will require values from codeconfigService.serverConfigcode and depend on it for specific behaviour  doing this asynchronously and have a codedefered.thencode in every controller does not seem like the best idea.p

Negative 1805 pI am programming a test program that is supposed to do a binary compare on video files. The idea is that we have some standard files that we have agreed on being OKAY and then we have some test files that we need to compare with the standard files. Now these files are located on my computer and I therefore need to specify the directory path in which these files are located. So instead of typing it manually in, in the function call, I would like to be able to have a browse button which makes me browse all files on my computer, just as when you open a file in Word or some other application like that.p  pNow I have tried with OpenFileDialog, but as I have understood this does not Work in a asp webapplication. I have also tried using FileUpload, but this does not seem to Work for me, as I do not want to upload anything. so my question is are there some alternative to this Or will I have to just skip this ideap  pI hope you can help mep  pRegardsp  pMagnus  p

Negative 1805 pThere are a variety of ways that it can be useful to make some transformation when escaping usergenerated text before displaying it as html.  For example, one might want to convert newlines to codeltbrgtcode, linkify urls, replace spaces with codeampnbspcodes, etc.p  pTypical recommendations for how to do this type of transformation involve first escaping the text and then making the appropriate substitutions afterthefact.  For example, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma14795104httpstackoverflow.coma14795104a that one is for Mako rather than Jinja2 but they both seem to use markupsafe for escaping suggests to pass alreadyescaped text into the function and then to call codes.replacen, Markupltbr gtcode.  However, these recommendations seem somewhat fragile  they assume that the escaping process wont introduce any of the characters to be replaced, and they dont work too well when chained.  For example, if you first converted urls to links and then attempted to replace spaces with codeampnbspcodes, you might wind up with something like codeltaampnbsphref...code.p  pIt seems like the more correct way to handle this would be for the escaping function to take some kind of transformation function as a parameter to allow the text to be translated as part of the escaping process.  Is there an existing way to do this in Jinja2p

Negative 1805 pI have been searching around for the answer to this problem but have come of with little information on how to solve the problem. What I am looking to do is be able to use Graphics2D to do all the graphics I need, within a window. I am not very lenient on the use of Graphics2D and a BufferStrategy because I have a large amount of existing code that uses these to make a full screen window using the computers GraphicsDevice. This is a test that I made but there is something that I am missing.p  precodepublic static void mainString[] args      Creates a frame and sets properties     JFrame frame  new JFrameFrameDemo     frame.setDefaultCloseOperationJFrame.EXITONCLOSE     frame.setSize500, 500     frame.setResizabletrue     frame.setVisibletrue     frame.createBufferStrategy2      Gets Graphics2D from the bufferstrategy     BufferStrategy s  frame.getBufferStrategy     Graphics2D g  Graphics2Ds.getDrawGraphics      Draws a background and a line for testing     g.setColorColor.GRAY     g.drawRect0, 0, 500, 500     g.setColorColor.BLACK     g.drawLine50, 50, 200, 50      Displays the graphics to the frame     frame.updateg     g.dispose     s.show  codepre  pWhen run this only creates an empty frame that is set to the correct size and produces no errors but the line and background are not displayed.p  pMy guess is the problem stems from the last three lines of code where the frame is updated. My confusion is how to display the Graphics2D components when using the BufferStategy... Do you still have to update the frame or do you just need to show the BufferStategy Any help would be much appreciated and thank you in advance.p

It serves as fallback solution when  every other rewriteredirect fails e.g. in an aliased environment without  modrewrite. Additionally, this reduces the matching process for the  startpage path  because otherwise Apache will apply the rewritting rules  to each configured DirectoryIndex file e.g. index.php, index.html, index.pl. DirectoryIndex app.php  ltIfModule modrewrite.cgt     RewriteEngine On        Redirect to URI without front controller to prevent duplicate content      with and without app.php. Only do this redirect on the initial      rewrite by Apache and not on subsequent cycles. Otherwise we would get an      endless redirect loop request gt rewrite to front controller gt      redirect gt request gt ....      So in case you get a too many redirects error or you always get redirected      to the startpage because your Apache does not expose the REDIRECTSTATUS      environment variable, you have 2 choices       disable this feature by commenting the following 2 lines or       use Apache gt 2.3.9 and replace all L flags by END flags and remove the        following RewriteCond best solution     RewriteCond HTTPHOST m..     RewriteCond ENVREDIRECTSTATUS      RewriteRule appmobile.php. CONTEXTPREFIX2 [R301,L]      RewriteCond HTTPHOST m..     RewriteCond ENVREDIRECTSTATUS      RewriteRule app.php. CONTEXTPREFIX2 [R301,L]           If the requested filename exists, simply serve it.      We only want to let Apache serve files and not directories.     RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f     RewriteRule .  [L]       The following rewrites all other queries to the front controller. The      condition ensures that if you are using Apache aliases to do mass virtual      hosting, the base path will be prepended to allow proper resolution of the      app.php file it will work in nonaliased environments as well, providing      a safe, onesize fits all solution.

Negative 1805 pSo the problem that Ive run into is the following Currently, the symfony2 project I have has a user entity with its own methods for encrypting its password in the databasep  precodeprivate function blowfishCryptpassword,cost      chars.ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789     saltsprintf2a02d,cost     Create a 22 character salt edit 2013.01.15  replaced rand with mtrand     mtsrand     fori0ilt22i salt.chars[mtrand0,63]     return cryptpassword,salt   public function encryptPasswordstring      thisgtsetEncryptedPasswordthisgtblowfishCryptstring, 10  codepre  pThe login method basically just checks the entered password like so p  precodeif cryptuserPost[password], usergtgetEncryptedPassword  usergtgetEncryptedPassword codepre  pThen it sets session variables, codeauthTokencode and codeuserIdcode.p  pBut because of that throughout the application calls are having to be made to ensure that the userId and authToken are set in the session  so that any action we want authenticated users only to have access to we have to do a check likep  precodeif authToken  return 401  not exactly, but you get the idea. codepre  pMy temporary solution to clean up all those checks was to create an interface that all my controllers can implement that will run some code before the controller action, and can return a redirect if the user is not logged in. What I would like to do is rewrite all of this so that I can utilize symfony2s security layer. How can I accomplish thisp  pEDIT I have a separate portal running from the same code base that uses an entirely different table like an administration portal for users. Assuming the above is possible, is this possible with symfony2s security featuresp  pEDIT 2 Trying to get this all integrated, so the first step I thought would be to implement UserInterface in my User entity.

Basically I need users to be able to access , login, signup, etc, without logging in. Almost every other page will require an authenticated user. I havent gotten to the custom password encoder yet, I figure that will be my last step. I want to get past this redirect loop problem. Any ideasp

Negative 1805 pI am working on a project and am just stymied by this. It should be really straight forward. I have included the code so you can see the other Menu Strip Items.   p  pThe user has the ability to open as many Child forms into the mdiParent form. I would like the Window function on the menu strip to populate with the Bank Name found on the Child form so if a user had 10 bank forms open, they could find a specific form by clicking Window and seeing the bank name the name of the text field which I would like to pull is Bank.lblbank.text This functionality was found in the 2007 and older versions of many of the Microsoft Suite products.p  pIf I hadnt seen my professor do this in class, I would think it was a bit of proprietary Microsoft Office coding that us mere mortals cannot access.  Unfortunately, he whipped it out and I didnt get it captured.p  pObviously, I am not asking the right questions on the search engines because I cannot find a clear answer. Does anyone have any advice This functionality isnt necessary but a little something I want to add. Ive worked on this way too long and just want a little bit of success.p  pLet me know if a zip copy of the project or screen prints would be helpful.

Negative 1805 pI need to programmatically find out which JRE classes can be referenced in a compilation unit without being imported for static code analysis. We can disregard packagelocal classes. a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavasespecsjlsse7htmljls7.htmljls7.3 relnofollowAccording to the JLSa, classes from the package codejava.langcode are implicitly imported. The output should be a list of a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavalangClassLoader.htmlname relnofollowbinary class namesa. The solution should work with plain Java 5 and up no Guava, a hrefhttpcode.google.compreflections relnofollowReflectionsa, etc., and be vendor agnostic.p  pAny reliable Javabased solution is welcome.p  hr  pHere are some notes on what Ive tried so farp  pAt first glance, it seems that the question boils down to How to load all classes from a package, which is of course practically impossible, although several workarounds exist e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq5203281005481thisa and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq11565521005481thisa, plus the blog posts linked there. But my case is much simpler, because the multiple classloaders issue does not exist. codejava.langcode stuff can always be loaded by the systembootstrap classloader, and you cannot create your own classes in that package. Problem is, the system classloader does not divulge its class path, which the linked appoaches rely on.p  pSo far, I havent managed to get access to the system classloaders class path, because on the HotSpot VM Im using, codeObject.class.getClassLoadercode returns codenullcode, and codeThread.currentThread.getContextClassLoadercode can load codejava.lang.Objectcode by delegation, but does not itself include the classpath. So solutions like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq92208871005481this onea dont work for me. Also, the a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase7docsapijavalangSystem.htmlgetProperties2829 relnofollowlist of guaranteed system propertiesa does not include properties with this kind of classpath info such as codesun.boot.class.pathcode.p  pIt would be nice if I didnt have to assume that there is an emrt.jarem at all, and rather scan the list of resources used by the system classloader. Such an approach would be safer with respect to vendor specific JRE implementations.p
Negative 1805 pI have a service that runs on a LAN with no clients other than the ones I create.

Negative 1805 pIm currently making an inventory for my office using an application called GPLI. This application saves the information for every computer stored in the inventory with an SQL database.  My question is, I have to make a text document for every employee where they sign to be responsible for every computer theyre lent, and it would be much faster if I had the ability to transfer certain parts of the SQL database into the word document so i dont have to look for the information and write it manually. Ive seen this work with excel where you just click next and the fields that youve setup change manually so all the letters are done automatically.  So, is there a way to take information from an SQL database into a Microsoft Word Document directly or is there a way to take the information from an SQL database into an Excel document  Thanks in advance for your help. p

Negative 1805 pWe recently made the switch from SVN to GIT for our repo management, and have a good grasp on the nonlinear source control style.

In the end, We wish to lock our codemastercode branch of our core libraries, as they are missioncritical and require peer review through pullrequests.

If kappa is low     small intensity gradients are able to block conduction and hence diffusion     across step edges.  A large value reduces the influence of intensity     gradients on conduction.      gamma controls speed of diffusion you usually want it at a maximum of     0.25      step is used to scale the gradients in case the spacing between adjacent     pixels differs in the x,y andor z axes      Diffusion equation 1 favours high contrast edges over low contrast ones.

Negative 1805 pI am new to the world of web development. I know how to use PHP and so I can do that just fine, but I am a little behind on modern practices. Last night I went ahead and used the LightOpenID library with CodeIgniter to create a login section on my website. The user clicks log in which takes them to a login page with a Google log in button. That button uses the URL generated by LightOpenID to direct the user to the Google Account selection page which asks for permissionsetc. It then redirects the user to my website where I write their details to the database for future use  like a silent registration feature. I store their first name, last name, email and OpenID. I then create a session for the user and the user can now browse my website. Super simple. p  pThe reason I felt like I should explain that is because I wanted to point out how little I want to utilize the users account. I just need them to sign in with Google for authentication. Googles OpenIDoauth2 migration page and all of their migration examples which are a little beyond me explain Google authentication for the purpose of retrieving a users friend circles and other social junk. I dont need anything this complicated, all I need is authentication.p  pSo I was wondering what method I should be using now instead Google says use oauth 2, but not early oauth 2.. I have no idea what the difference is. They also say that I should only use Google now and I am wondering if you guys can help me find a simple library that handles authentication for mep

We store latitude and longitude as DOUBLE for now            AND uu.longitude     between lon1    and lon2            AND uu.dateOfBirth   between maxAge  and minAge  dates are in millis, therefore maxAge will have a smaller value than minAge and so it needs to go first          AND IFgender       is null, TRUE, u.gender  gender    AND IFactivityType is null, TRUE, u.preferredActivityType  activityType    AND u.accountState  A    AND u.id  userId HAVING distanceInMiles lt searchRadius ORDER BY distanceInMiles LIMIT pagingStart, pagingLength codepre  pBRp  precodeCREATE INDEX findMatches ON users latitude ASC, longitude ASC, dateOfBirth ASC USING BTREE codepre  pBr p  pThe idea here is to have an inner query that identifies qualifying rows based on user location and age, using the covering index specified above. In a table with a few million rows, that narrows them down to a few thousand without requiring a full table scan. Then the resulting rows are tested against more finegrain conditions, such as gender, availability, etc.  this time a full scan of the reduced resultset is inevitable.p  pThis runs almost as expected, codeEXPLAINcode reveals that the inner query does indeed make use of the full key length 3 columns of the covering index, and the outer query then looks up the rows returned, by PK. img srchttpi.stack.imgur.commv66l.png altenter image description herep  pbr strongThe problemstrongbr The performance is satisfactory while the search range is within a few hundred miles, but when I get to a thousand miles, it starts degrading because the number of users within the specified boundary increases. The problem would also become apparent if the search range remained the same, but the number of users increased by a few orders. Here are the problems that I have identified so farp  ol liMySQL does not currently support codeLIMITcode in inner queries, therefore the inner query will return ALL qualifying codeuserIDscode i.e., thousands, even if the outer query will then limit them to just a dozen or so.li liEnabling codeoptimizertracecode and looking at the work behind the scenes suggests that only column codelatitudecode of my covering index is used as a coderangecode. Im not sure why that is, especially since codeEXPLAINcode suggests that the full index key length is used.li ol  pbr strongThe questionstrongbr How do I solve 1 and 2 above Before somebody suggests using spatial data types for lat and long, please note that a hrefhttpdev.mysql.comdocrefman5.7eninnodbrestrictions.html relnofollowthe latest InnoDB engine MySQL v5.7 does not support spatial indexes, just spatial data typesa.p

Negative 1805 pI have made an application using JavaFX 2.2 and want to switch to JavaFX 8.

In addition the nodes have an incorrect size compare Step 1 and the small little dot. Another problem is that when performing actions such as adding nodes the application lags heavily in JavaFX8.p  pUnfortunately I do not get any error messages at all and I have almost no clue what I have to fix in order to get the application working in JavaFX8. Any helpideashints would be greatly appreciated.p  pPossible issues p  ul liI have used Platform.runLater very often in my application. Has this perhaps changed in JavaFX 8li liin JavaFX2.2 the size of a node e.g. stackpane containing text was automatically computed after adding it to the scroll pane. Lets say I add a node with position x and y. Only after JavaFX has drawn it I can get its height and width boundsInParent.getHeight. This is also the reason why I often used Platform.runLater in order to layout the nodes. Has this behaviour changed in JavaFX 8li ul  pEDIT The bug is connected with css styling. If I remove the stylesheets that are added to the nodes everything works fine except the styling of the nodes of course. In particular the commands I have to remove are of the following form p  pgetStylesheets.addClassName.class.getResourceCSSFile.css.toExternalFormp

If a just could only save the string contentToUpdate                          var page  RavenSession.LoadltCorePagegtmodelAsCorrectModel.Id             RavenSession.Deletepage             RavenSession.SaveChanges              RavenSession.StoremodelAsCorrectModel             RavenSession.SaveChanges              var modelToReturn  new JavaScriptSerializer.SerializemodelAsCorrectModel               return JsonmodelToReturn                   return null      codepre  pby doing it this way, my model in the razorview never gets updated before I reload the page. That means If a save on of my WYSIWYGeditors, its content gets updated to ravendb. But if I save another one without refreshing the page after I saved the first one.  Then just that another one gets updated. Because the model sent in to the savemethod is still the first model sent in to the view. So the first one saved, then gets overwritten by the original Model, because it still holds the original models valuesp

Negative 1805 pI am looking for a solution to what is seemingly straightforward but .....p  pIn SharePoint 2013 I have a series of External Content Types defined which all have a child relationship to a parent  they all have fields such as MainID for the parent and ChildID in the child. p  pI can successfully display all of these items in a webpage which has an External Content Type Picker which passes the IDs as a filter to each of the child lists p  pThe problem that I have is creating a new item from the child lists which requires the user to manually add in an ID value to the ChildID field in the form. Clearly this is not ideal. p  pSo in simple terms  I want to New Item link for each child list and pass the ID which links the webparts to a field in the Child newifs.aspx form [ChildID]p  pany help gratefully received.....p

Here is my arrayp  precodeArray  [0] gt Array              [tagid] gt 1         [tag] gt vestas         [subtag] gt Array                                  [1] gt Array              [tagid] gt 2         [tag] gt novo nordisk         [subtag] gt Array                                  [2] gt Array              [tagid] gt 3         [tag] gt stock         [subtag] gt Array                              [0] gt stocks                 [1] gt stock market                     [3] gt Array              [tagid] gt 4         [tag] gt bil         [subtag] gt Array                                  [4] gt Array              [tagid] gt 5         [tag] gt flower         [subtag] gt Array                              [0] gt flowers                      codepre  pI want to count occurrence of these tags in my articles. And the subtags should give points to the main tag. For example if I have an article that sounds like thisp  pVestas is a great company, the stocks are doing well on the stock exchangep  pThis article would give 1 count to vestas tag and 2 counts to stock as there are both stocks and  stock. p  pI prefer regex as I want to search the articles for exact words, and Im thinking something like this p  precode   if pregmatchallbsubtagsb, content, matches                      subtagcount  countmatches[0]     codepre  pAnd somehow use a foreach loop to loop through the subtags and main tag.p  pI appreciate your help Thanks in advance p

Negative 1805 pMy goal is to create an interactive web visualization of data from motion tracking experiments.p  pThe trajectories of the moving objects are rendered as points connected by lines.  The visualization allows the user to pan and zoom the data.p  pMy current prototype uses Processing.js because I am familiar with Processing, but I have run into performance problems when drawing data with greater than 10,000 vertices or lines.  I pursued a couple of strategies for implementing the pan and zoom, but the current implementation, which I think is the best, is to save the data as an svg image and use the PShape data type in Processing.js to load, draw, scale and translate the data.  A cleaned version of the codep  precode pjs preloadnanoparticletrajs.svg  PShape trajs  void setup     size900, 600    trajs  loadShapenanoparticletrajs.svg    function that repeats and draws elements to the canvas void draw      shapetrajs,centerX,centerY,imgW,imgH    ...additional functions that get mouse events codepre  pPerhaps I should not expect snappy performance with so many data points, but are there general strategies for optimizing the display of complex svg elements with Processing.js  What would I do if I wanted to display 100,000 vertices and lines  Should I abandon Processing all togetherp  pThanksp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pUpon reading the following answer, I thought an image would help convey the essence of the visualizationbr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxgqdd.jpg altScreen capture of the currently implemented visualization  p  pIt is essentially a scatter plot with 10,000 points and connecting lines.

Negative 1805 pFor some reason the National Weather Services xml site does not work for me.

I have tried making the url https.... instead but that did nothing. Ive tried specifying codetypeGETcode in the ajax call as well. Every time I run the script it returns codeerror0errorcode . Does anyone have any ideas A working implementation of an ajax call would be even better, Ive been working at this for days and its driving me crazy that I cant seem to retrieve this data.p  pin response to the first comment, I looked into it before but it seems like the SOAP service is for requesting data packages, such as the weather in SF from january to september or something, and from the looks of thisp  pXML Feeds of Current Weather Conditions This page provides access to observed current weather conditions for about 1,800 locations across the United States and US Territories.

Negative 1805 pHeres the current problem I have an XFA Form created by a 3rd party and I would like to use it as is.  I was able generate the PDF with filled fields byp  precodea Extracting the XML via Acrobat Pro b filling the fields within the XML and calling              XfaForm xfa  form.getXfa             xfa.fillXfaFormnew FileInputStreamXML codepre  pWhat Im trying to do is just stamp an imagewatermark over the 2nd page which has a form wmultiple fields.  The DRAFT png image Im stamping has a transparent background so if the overlay works, the image background should make the underlay appear and look like that the image text is sitting on top of the pdf page.p  pWhat I wanted to accomplish would have been trivial if this was not an XFA form.  I would just use iTexts pdfStamper and stamp this transparent PNG over the 2nd page, but since Im now confined to use Adobe LiveCycle Designer, I noticed that this once trivial task in the non XFA document isnt so trivial within XFA. From a previous post, I learned that I couldnt mix technologies together.  I had to choose between nonXFA AcroForms vs XFA built by Adobe LiveCycle Designer.  Basically, I couldnt do a fillXFA then use the stamper, so I had to figure out how to do this using XFA.p  pIve tried the following steps as a static PDF and a dynamic PDF....it didnt make a difference what type the PDF was.p  p1 Within Adobe LiveCycle Designer, I went to the second page of the source PDF and defined 2 image fields.p  precode  overlay1  this will span the top portion width of the page which has text               content underneath   overlay2  this will span the lower portion width of the page which has text               content underneath codepre  p2 As a test...I selected an image for overlay1 which has a transparent background and its    foreground background as DRAFT    At design time...the DRAFT transparency image worked and it was laid on top of the content correctly       for the imageField overlay1.    I saved the modified XFAbased PDF, opened it up in Acrobat Pro, and exported the XFA XML structure.    I verified that overlay1 had the DRAFT image as a base64 encoded string.p  precodeltoverlay1 xmlnsxfahttpwww.xfa.orgschemaxfadata1.0 xfacontentTypeimagepng gtiVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAACWAAAAJYCAYAAADmY91UAAAACXBIWXMAAC4jAAAuIwF4pT92AABH ....... ....... codepre  p3 When I took the same base 64 string and only entered its content within overlay2 and rendered it through the fillXFA method...the image was a black box instead.    I also opened the file in Acrobat Pro, then double clicked on the imageField area, selected the transparent image, and it still showed up as a black box.     I repeated the previous step with an image wno transparency and its rectangular white background    overlayed everything underneath it.p  p4 I went ahead and made another image...one that didnt have any transparency.    DRAFT with no transparency and its background is white.    I had it encoded in base64 format.    I was able to place it within both overlay1 amp overlay2 image fields without any problems.    The new problem is that the white background of the DRAFT images covered everything behind it.p  pWhy did the initial transparent png work during the Adobe LifeCycle Design design time and after    a fillXFA call it shows up as a black box  But if I change the image to not use transparency at    all...everything worksp  pDoes XFA not support transparent images for image fields during an xfa fill  Remember, it worked during design time when I told Adobe LiveCycle designer to use this transparent png for this field.p  pIm basically trying to create 2 image watermarks over a specific page within an XFA pdf.p  pMy current backup plan is to flatten the PDF take off the XFA and putting back all the fields back on the form using Acrobat Pro and filling it using the standard PDF itext calls and using a stamper this is going to be tedious since theres a bunch of fields.  But Id like to know if anyone ever had to do the same wan XFA PDF form before I look at option B.p

Negative 1805 pI crosscompiled TCPDUMP and PCAP to make Tcpdump available for Android.  It does not require installation because all that is required is a rooted device to allow wifi card to run in monitor mode and a terminal emulator.  It is simply a folder which you browse to with the terminal emulator and type tcpdump XX nn vv s0 i wlan0  and it shows traffic in realtime.I want to put it on Google play store for free so others can enjoy it.  I have never put anything on Google play store before and Im not sure if they would accept just a noninstallable folder as an app. Is there a way to make this folder into an apk that just simply installs the folder  I mainly wanted something like this that shows traffic in realtime visually with minimum permissions other than rooted device.  does anyone have any experience in submitting apps to Google or do you think the idea is just a waste of time  Be brutally honest I can take it. heres a screenshot of it running a hrefhttpwww.smisecurity.altervista.orgtcpdump.png relnofollowhttpwww.smisecurity.altervista.orgtcpdump.pngap

Negative 1805 pWe are in the process of migrating to RAD 9 and WebSphere 8.5.5.  We have a JAXWS web service project that has been working for years.

Negative 1805 pHas there been any work on supporting vectorstyle recycling for general data in Haskell For example runningp  precodemain  do   let ls  [1..1000000]   print ls codepre  pwith codepcode states that it allocates a total of 425mb. Runningp  precodemain  do   let ls  [1..1000000]   print ls   print ls  [1] codepre  pwith codepcode states that it allocates twice that, at 820mb.p  pI understand why this is happening, but Im wondering why GHC does not perform this optimization. I suppose one reason is that it doesnt show up much in real code so the benefits are slight, if anything but maybe a general way to recycle any inductive structure could give some benefit. Usually people are told to use other data structures anyways e.g. Data.Seq.p  pps  Ive seen links to the Recycle Your Arrays paper by Roman Leshchinskiy, however all links on the web are now dead and I dont want to pay to read it via Springerp  peditp  pWhen I use a hrefhttpshackage.haskell.orgpackagedeepseq relnofollowdeepseqa instead of print, I get similar but less extreme results.

Negative 1805 pI have a C COM object 32 bit. This COM object calls a C COM Object and as part of the initialization, passes an interface pointer IDispatch to C.

The exception seems to be coming from ComEventsSinks.cs  but this is not a connection point container or connection point. I am trying to access the interface given by the calling C object.p  pI gave up and created a simple ATL COM object and I tried to  accomplish the same, and it works great. I could even to  what I eventually wanted to do, CoMarshalInterfaceThreadInStream and  CogetInterfaceandRelease stream from a background thread and all works beautifully.p  pBut for some reason, the C cant even call back to C even from the  original thread, let alone my background thread.p  pI am scratching my head from the past 2 or 3 days and tried all kinds of  stuff but this beats me. p  pAny ideas pointers Perhaps I am doing something silly and stupidp

Negative 1805 pI have an application which uses a three helper threads to read from a database 3 different tables, 160,000 rows in total, create objects from those rows, then add the objects to one of two lists, depending on what type of object was created. The helper threads add objects to the list through a SendMessage call so that the main thread is the only object addingremoving tofrom the list.p  pThe odd thing is that SendMessage doesnt always succeed, Ill frequently get these two errors ERRORALREADYEXISTS 183 and ERRORTRUSTEDDOMAINFAILURE 1788. The function that SendMessage calls just adds an object to the list, and this function always returns success 0. Theres no creating files as ERRORALREADYEXISTS seems to suggest and theres no network calls so Im not sure why Im getting ERRORTRUSTEDDOMAINFAILURE errors.p  pAny ideas on what might be causing these errors or any way to debug these errorsp  pAs a note, before it was SendMessage I was using PostMessage and would get lots of ERRORNOTENOUGHQUOTA errors SendMessage makes the utility work a lot better.p

Negative 1805 pIm working on a backup service. It tracks changes of the files in a the directory to backup. It does that by setting a watch using inotify with Linux and comparing the modification time and size after a file has been changed. When it is, the whole file is copied to backup. Im thinking, could this be done much more efficient If the backup service can determine the offset and the number of bytes written, it can just copy that, in stead of copy the whole file. Ive been looking to fanotify, which offers some interesting features, like an fd to the file modified by the other process. Now here it stops I think.

Negative 1805 pI am writing a program on assembler using TASM 4.1 and I have stumbled upon a problem I have been unable to fix for 2 days. The problem is that TASM just wont recognize labels in macro as local labels and would give me an error when assembling Symbol already defined elsewhere. So far I have tried the following thingsp  ol liPutting LOCALS at the very beginning of .asm file and using  for local labels as was suggested in one of the answers to a similar problem. Produced zero effect whatsoever.li liUsing LOCAL inside a macro to list all my local labels starting with  again, as was suggested on the web. However, this produced even more errors when assembling Symbol already different kind and Expecting pointer typeli liPutting LOCALS  at the beginning of macro. Just like with the first case, zero effect.li liPutting LOCALS at the beginning of .asm file and listing labels using LOCAL. Same effect as with 2.li liPutting LOCALS at the beginning of .asm file and using LOCALS  inside macro. No effect.li liPutting LOCALS  at the beginning of .asm file. No effect.li ol  pThis is my very first time trying to program, so I apologize if I missed some trivial thing that causes this problem.

Is there some other option that I am missing changing the order will not work in this specific case and I dont like the idea of including the urls with empty pattern.p

Negative 1805 pSimple version of this question stronghow can I tell if a user is authenticated through Facebook after they are logged in with ASP.NET Identitystrongp  pVS2013, ASP.NET SPA Template, ASP.NET Identity 2.2.1p  pId like to know if a user authenticated via Facebook. I was previously able to do this callp  precodeExternalLoginData externalLogin  ExternalLoginData.FromIdentityUser.Identity as ClaimsIdentity codepre  pinside of my GetExternalLogin method. Now, though, it works the first time when called from GetExternalLogin returning an object describing the facebook login but upon returning form the postback to Facebook, its called again from my GetUserInfo method and it returns null. I dug into the code, and found the offending linep  precodeif providerKeyClaim.Issuer  ClaimsIdentity.DefaultIssuer      return null  codepre  pThe value for both of these things is LOCAL AUTHORITY and null is returned.p  pIn the instance when it works correctly, providerKeyClaim.Issuer  Facebook. Can anyone explain what this check is for, and why this condition is being met despite a Facebook login I wish I knew when it last worked for me. I updated my version of ASP.NET Identity though Im not sure if it worked after.p  pUpdate Looks like during the call to GetExternalLogin, the User.Identity object was issued by Facebook. But for the subsequent GetUserInfo call, its an entirely separate locally generated object, generated by the ASP.NET Identity components.p

If she imports just a small number of Excel files, it is fine.  But if she imports a bunch say, 20 in a batch, it will fail on one of the files which specific file will change from attempt to attempt with the external table is not in the expected format error.p  pThe line it is dying on isp  precodePerform the same action for the other named rangestables.

Negative 1805 pI try to eliminate all warnings in all my code. I find this improves the quality of my code. This becomes problematic when the RubyMine inspections find an issue that I cant resolve.

Negative 1805 pIm trying to use two large, complex linear algebra libraries which define many of the same functions. I cant rewrite legally in one case, but technically in both either of them.

Negative 1805 pTraditionally in the template method pattern, a base class implements some algorithms and defers to derived classes for specific behavior. This works well in languages like CCJava because you can use protected on those methods to hide them from the callers but keep it visible for derived classes. For example, in the GoF book, you have something likep  precodeclass Application      void CreateDocument  ..., thisgtDoCreateDocument      protected void DoCreateDocument    override for custom behavior  codepre  pThis keeps the public interface for codeApplicationcode clean. In Swift, because you cannot use codeprotectedcode, the public interface is not clean. I do not want users of codeApplicationcode to see codeDoCreateDocumentcode.p  pSo Im trying another method, which instead of using methods for codeDoCreateDocumentcode, Im trying to define a closure and use functor patterns.p  precodeclass Application      typealias ActionFunc   gt      private let doCreateDocument  ActionFunc     inita  ActionFunc  self.doCreateDocument  a      func CreateDocument          self.doCreateDocument       codepre  pSo this class looks good  the public interface is clean. However, its impossible to actually use this.p  pThe obvious approach is using a derived classp  precodeclass DoApplication  Application      init          super.init             a                    This would work, but you cannot use self here                 self.  anything with self. is an error                    codepre  pThe problem with this approach is that in the initializer, you cannot pass a closure to codesuper.initcode that uses codeselfcode. I get the error codeself used before super.initcode.p  pThat basically makes it useless because you cannot access any state variables.p  pHowever, if you dont initialize codedoCreateDocumentcode in the codeinitcode, you need to expose a setter of some sorts  again, the lack of codeprotectedcode means that the setter is on the public API. Yuck.p  pSo is there any way to cleanly implement the template pattern that keeps the interface cleanp

However, if I try to call a function that takes arguments, I get symbols not found link errors when compiling.

Negative 1805 pI am building an application using Xamarin Android, it uses a PCL project as a Service layer. I have a Web Api endpoint and I am using codeHttpClientcode to consume it.p  pEverything works fine, but if I leave my Android app open and idle for a while like 2 minutes and I try to make a new request, the first request using the singleton codeHttpClientcode wont work. It just never returns and stays there until it timeouts codeTaskCancelledExceptioncode. I also put a breakpoint on my Api and it doesnt get hit. If I try to send the request again, then it works.p  pAfter a lot of debugging I found that this only happens if I try to use the codeHttpClientcode as a Singleton.

Negative 1805 pI am currently trying to do the following with LLVM.p  pCurrently we have a large number of c files, we are using LLVM to compile them in parallel.p  pWe are trying to count how many times the callsites have been called.p  pPerformance is a very large portion of concern so that accessing the counters are limited to one array access. p  pSo we right now have the following idea. Each module keeps their own copy of enums of specific type, such as counter, as below. p  precode... typedef enum     FIRST,     SECOND,     THIRD,     LAST countertag ... codepre  pWe use one single array to record the counter corresponding to each tag. And we access that array element to access the counter. as below.p  precodeincrementcountercountertag tagid      counterarray[tagid]  codepre  pSo here comes the challengep  ol lipThe compilations are done in parallel, so we do not know how many tags are out there.  And so we do not know how to size the array.pli lipThe tags of each module needs to be given a proper offset to separate them from the other modules, they all need independent counters.pli lipMemory and cpu performance is very limited, so using a hashmap in this case cost too much to be acceptable. It must be done in one array access.pli ol  pSo our focus have been into if there are anything we can do at the time when LLVM does the optimization, or during the linking phase, or if it is resolvable with some modification within LLVMp  pThank you very much for the potential help. If any of the above input confuses you please let me know I will try to make it as clear as possible.p

Negative 1805 pI looked through some similar question but couldnt find an example of this sort of logic what im looking for is a way to parse through a large return of usernames in powershell. User names that are not service accounts or kiosks have a specific naming convention of 6 grouped numeric characters for example username123456. I was thinking there has to be a way of using the whereobject command but cant find anything on the syntax on technet or other PS resources. The one liner to get a return from the local domain isp  precodeSearchADAccount PasswordNeverExpires   SelectObject Name, Enabled codepre  pThis returns a list of domain accounts that have the password set to never expire. I want to only see the ones with the above naming convention  I know you can achieve this with regex but my regex is quite rustyif it can be done with whereobject that would be optimal. I also looked into using pattern, but it seems to be for more complex returns than this... Thanksp
