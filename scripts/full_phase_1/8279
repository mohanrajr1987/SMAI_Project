Positive 8279 pOn a our Heroku Rails 4.2 web app running Unicorn workers, where each worker needs about 230MB, we can run 2 per 1X Heroku dyno, or 4 per 2X Heroku dyno. CPU requirements are quite low.p  pIf we need 8 workers to handle our traffic, what are the technical  performance tradeoffs of using four 1X dynos vs. two 2X dynos to get 8 workersp  pTwo years ago there was a wellpublicized issue with the way Heroku was routing to dynos that as I recall suggested larger dynos with more workers worked best because there was less chance of a request being routed to a busy dyno. But Im not finding any emcurrentem guidelines on when it is best to use larger dynos vs more dynos.p

Positive 8279 pIm learning Ruby on Rails, and having lots of difficulty setting up. So I have created this new app, using coderails newcode command. Modified a bit, and now on way to deploy it on heroku.p  pFirst try, it failed because heroku required the app to use postgresql rather than sqlite3, which was set as a default database. So I downloaded and installed postgresql, and here is the where the trouble began.p  pAfter installing the postgres, I set up the path. And then I was unable to run the app locally anymore.p  pIn command, coderails servercode command is not working anymore, showing all kinds of error not being able to load stuff.p  pIt looks like thisp  precodeDrubyappnamegtrails server cRailsInstallerRuby2.1.0librubygems2.1.0gemspg0.17.1x86mingw32libpg.rb10in require cannot load such file 2.1pgext ltLoadErrorgt codepre  pand another bunch of load error.p  pNo need to mention deploying on heroku, it fails everytime.

Positive 8279 h2What Im trying to doh2  pI have a web app hosted on Heroku, which uses Django, with the domain say codeexample.comcode. I wanted to make all incoming codehttpexample.comcode requests redirect to codehttpsexample.comcode.p  h2What Ive doneh2  pI set up a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.8refmiddlewaredjango.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware relnofollowSecurityMiddlewarea in Django and set codeSECURESSLREDIRECTcode to be codeTruecode, which a hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.8refsettingsstdsettingSECURESSLREDIRECT relnofollowredirects all nonHTTPS requests to HTTPSa. This seems to work.p  h2The problemh2  pHeroku serves as a proxy to my Django app. So when the Heroku loadbalancer gets an HTTPS request, it probably routes to my web app using a nonHTTPS connection. Which freaks out my app, and it redirects it to HTTPS again, setting off a redirect loop.p  pa hrefhttpsdocs.djangoproject.comen1.8refsettingssecureproxysslheader relnofollowThe way to solve this seems to bea to set codeSECUREPROXYSSLHEADER  HTTPXFORWARDEDPROTO, httpscode as a setting in Django. This tells my app if the proxy sends the header HTTPXFORWARDEDPROTO, and if its value is https, then trust the connection. I tried this, and it works.p  pHowever, Im warned by the Django docs that I should make sure that my proxy strips incoming XFORWARDEDPROTO headers, which makes sense  if a malicious agent sends this header over a codehttpcode connection with an codehttpscode value my web app will be fooled.p  pstrongHow do I check if Heroku strips the codeXFORWARDEDPROTOcode header from incoming requestsstrongp

Negative 8279 pWe have a .net remoting application sitting in between web app and database. Occasionally we get strange problem. The remote call simply hangs and never returns.

Negative 8279 pMy app is a JApplet which opens a JFrame. the applet has a listener and a button, so that if the frame goes behind another window looses focus, the user can simply click the button to get it to come to the front.  codeframe.toFrontcode This works fine.p  pBut initially in the applets codepublic void init code, after calling codeframe.setVisibletruecode I call codeframe.toFrontcode to to make sure it starts in front.  However, the frame then immediately goes behind the browser.  Pressing the button calls it back, though. I have tried a running a separate thread which repeatedly calls codeframe.toFrontcode  But as soon as this stops, the frame goes behind the browser anyways.  Only when the button is pressed does it come to the front, and stay in front.  Also, having a loop or time continually holding it in front is not a good option, because the user may need or want to have it go behind on purpose.

Negative 8279 pIm trying to play some sounds in my flash project through action script. However for some reason in my code the call to Sound.play takes from 40ms to over 100ms in extreme cases, which is obviously more than enough to be very noticeable whenever a sound is played.

Negative 8279 pIm trying to build a grid, in rails, for entering data. It has rows and columns, and rows and columns are joined by cells. In my view, I need for the grid to be able to handle having new rows and columns on the edge, so that if you type in them and then submit, they are automatically generated, and their shared cells are connected to them correctly. I want to be able to do this without JS.p  pRails nested attributes fail to handle being mapped to both a new record and a new column, they can only do one or the other. The reason is that they are a nested specifically in one of the two models, and whichever one they arent nested in will have no id since it doesnt exist yet, and when pushed through acceptsnestedattributesfor on the top level Grid model, they will only be bound to the new object created for whatever they were nested in.p  pHow can I handle this Do I have to override rails handling of nested attributesp  pMy models look like this, btwp  precodeclass Grid lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany   rows   hasmany   columns   hasmany   cells, through gt rows    acceptsnestedattributesfor rows,     allowdestroy gt true,     rejectif gt lambda a a[description].blank    acceptsnestedattributesfor columns,     allowdestroy gt true,     rejectif gt lambda a a[description].blank   end    class Column lt ActiveRecordBase    belongsto grid    hasmany cells, dependent gt destroy    hasmany rows, through gt grid  end   class Row lt ActiveRecordBase    belongsto grid    hasmany   cells, dependent gt destroy    hasmany   columns, through gt grid     acceptsnestedattributesfor cells  end    class Cell lt ActiveRecordBase    belongsto row    belongsto column    hasone    grid, through gt row  end codepre

Negative 8279 pI created an NTLM authenticating SOAP client based on KSOAPAndroid and JCIFS.

JCIFS seems to be doing its job as well as I can see the NTLM challenge response taking place via Wireshark. The issue is that the message body is missing. It is simply null. Due to this the web service encounters a 501 and the codeInputStreamcode returned is null. p  pAnyone have a clue why this would happen p  pemNote Im removing the CONTENTLENGTH header below because codesetEntitycode apparently tries to set this but KSOAP has already set it. I simply remove it and allow codesetEntitycode to reset it.emp

Negative 8279 pSo basically I have a main table, and I want to filter that data to another table normally easy but I want this based upon 2 criteria. e.g. I want to filter the data of a specific department but only for the current month. The way I display the current month in the main table is by inserting the date from a userform and then by formatting that cell to just display the month. However, when using advanced filter I use the column headings that I want to filter e.g. department mens, month november worked out using now then formatting to just display the month but when Im running the filter its not picking out the information at all.p  pI think this lies with the way the month is worked out and displayed but I cant figure out another way to do this. Any help is greatly appreciated.p  pIm also open to trying a new method of just selecting data for the current month if anyone has a cleaner way, as Im sure there is one.p

Negative 8279 pIve taken up learning vb.net having come from a C background.p  pI was trying to reprogram a simple C winforms program I had, which took command line parameters to determine what it did. In C, there is always a main method to accept these arguments.p  pFrom what Ive read, vb.net implements a main method for you once you specify the starting form, unless you make one yourself. Which is fine, but the one Ive implemented seems to get ignored, Ive put break points in to see if the code even get looked at, but nothing. The main sub is in the class declaration of the startup form like sop  precodePublic Class FrontScreen     ltSTAThreadgt      Shared Sub Main         Dim mainWindow As FrontScreen  New FrontScreen         MessageBox.ShowHello Im exectuing         Application.RunmainWindow     End Sub End Class codepre  pObviously Im going to put more code in the main method later, but right now Id just like to get the message box to come up to show that my main sub is actually being executed. Im probably doing something really obvious wrong, but from the examples Ive seen I cant tell what. Any ideasp  pThanks, Andy.p

Negative 8279 pI want to make my first web app but dont know which is the best combination of technologies to use. The web app would be based on a Windows app I made with Visual Studio using C. Basically what the web page needs to do is to create some content dynamically based on an XML file on the server and then download data from Yahoo Finance to upload the content constantly. The user would be able to change views to display different subsets of the content, so the page is modified dynamically. The content is not user specific, but some parts of the page need to be created dynamically from the content of the XML file because it is updated daily, so I dont have to rewrite the page each time.p  pHope I am making myself clear, I am relatively new to developing and have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, and XML.p  pDo you know what are the best and easiest technologies to achieve something like thisp  pThanks.p

Negative 8279 pOkay, let me start off by saying that this is probably highly subjective and argumentative, and probably doesnt belong on here feel free to close if the feeling is mutual. Having said that, Im looking at some code, and I want to come to a standard approach for composition as it seems that different people have different styles  so, here are the styles Ive seen so far there may be more..

So the crux of the question is, is there something technically wrong with this approach and if not, why would you take the other two approachesp  hr  pEDIT I think the trivial example has not helped, in this particular instance, B is a resource manager, and own various components that are interlinked A  say for example various network connections etc. All the sub components can access each other through B  the whole system used to be a bunch of singletons... So the only reason that A knows of B is that it provides access to some other component that A needs... p  pIt is interesting that most answers recommend forwarding, yet I still cant see why this is advantageous over the templated approach  is there some inherent fear of using templates in code other than for simple, generic functions p

I mean is there a URL path to activating an extension.p  pAlso, I like the pinned tab feature, but it seems I can only do this Pin a tab and for it to open just like that every time by adding current tabs to open these pages. But if I pinned for eg. gmail.com and then I close it and later open it up again little later it wont pin it. Is using JSON with the 128 px icon and making your own web app the only way this can be achievedp  pThank you.p

Negative 8279 pGood day,p  pI have a ASP.net MVC app that needs to upload files to Amazon S3 with progress. I found a neat control called Flajaxian that does the job pretty well. The issue is that now I want to insert a row of data into a DB that keeps track of the uploads. If you look at the code below the control has a FileUploader1ConfirmUpload event that fires after the upload has completed. Url.ActionUpload, TracksController does not do what I want it to, which is fire the Upload Action in the TrackController Controller. This is the first time Ive worked with MVC so Im hoping there is a simple solution.p  pI originally had a submit button to perform the upload in code like this codeltdiv classsubmitBtnDivgtltinput typesubmit valueSubmit classsubmitBtn idtrackAdd gtltdivgtcode. but now the upload is asynchronous so i want to do the same postbackp  pThank you to everyone that takes the time to read through this, and even more to those that try to solve it.p  precode ltdiv classcontentsAccgtltform idform2 runatserver stylewidth400pxgt                 ltscript runatservergt                     private void FileUploader1FileNameDeterminingobject sender, FileNameDeterminingEventArgs e                                              e.FileName  SessionWrapper.PersonId.ToString    e.FileName                                      ltscriptgt                 ltscript runatservergt                     private void FileUploader1ConfirmUploadobject sender, ConfirmUploadEventArgs e                                              Url.ActionUpload, TracksController                                                                  ltscriptgt                     ltfjxFileUploader IDFileUploader1 runatservergt                         ltAdaptersgt                             ltfjxDirectAmazonUploader   OnFileNameDeterminingFileUploader1FileNameDetermining OnConfirmUploadFileUploader1ConfirmUpload                                 AccessKeyWebConfigAmazonAccessKey                                  SecretKeyWebConfigAmazonSecretKey                                 BucketNametracksupload gt                         ltAdaptersgt                     ltfjxFileUploadergt          ltformgtltdivgt codepre  pOk, so Ive tried to change my approach a bit from the above yesterday. Instead of trying to fire the Action of the TracksController i want to move that Action code into the ConfirmUpload event. But now I still need to get the values of the textboxes. Because MVC doesnt remember state it is proving difficult. Here are the textBoxes. they are on the same page as the code above.p  precode ltlabel forBandNamegtArtistltlabelgt         ltHtml.TextBoxArtists gtltHtml.ValidationMessageArtist,gt         ltdiv classclearfixgt         ltdivgt         ltlabel forSongNamegtSong Title         ltlabelgt           ltHtml.TextBoxSongName gtltHtml.ValidationMessageSongName,gt         ltdiv classclearfixgt         ltdivgt codepre  pIs it possible to pull the values of the textbox and have it sent to the ConfirmUpload event which happens server side If not with server code then maybe JavaScript client sidep  pstrongThe upload control im using is the only one that does excatly what I want, but it is web forms, the site is MVC.

Negative 8279 pIn plpgsql, Id like to use results from query A to execute several queries queries B, and return the results of all B queries as one table, but Im not sure how to do this. Do I use the RETURN QUERY functionality in plpgsqlp  pHeres an example.

Negative 8279 pIm new to C and so forgive me if I have some of my concepts skewed. Im working with the Canon EDSDK, and to make life easier Id like to be able to see error messages as text rather than hex values.

For examplep  precodeHashtable EDSDKErrorCodes  new Hashtable  EDSDKErrorCodes.Add0x00008D01, EDSERRTAKEPICTUREAFNG EDSDKErrorCodes.Add0x00008D08, EDSERRTAKEPICTURECARDPROTECTNG etc etc... codepre  pThe later in my code I could grab the error message returned from one of the EDSDK methods and display it in a human readable form p  precodeerrorcode EDSDK.EdsInitializeSDK  MessageBox.ShowConvert.ToStringEDSDKErrorCodes[errorcode] codepre  pMy question is .. is this a good way to handle all these error codes or is there a better and more efficient way that people would recommend  If so how I could fill my hash table  as a series of constants rather than having to use the Add methodp

Negative 8279 pIve done quite a bit of research on what I thought would be an easy question but I cannot find what I am looking for. I am simply trying to return a record as a match with only a search term matching part of the text in the record.p  pFor example, if the user searches for ed I would like any record that contains ed to be returned. So if there was a record with the name Edward in the name column it would be returned as a match. If there was a record with finished in the description, it would also return that record as a match.p  pI have looked into full text search but not sure if this is something that I would need to do or if it would even do what I need.p  pAs always, Im not looking for an answer per say, Im just looking for a direction.p

String manipulation is not acceptable.  I am looking for an elegant and efficient solution.p  pGiven a currency value ie 251.03, split the value into two half and round to two decimal places.

Negative 8279 pIm developing a solution in Silverlight 4 with RIA Services.  I am using data annotations on my entity to describe validation.

The data annotation i have on all the textboxes is the  annotation but this does not ever fire until a user has editted a textbox first, left the textbox, reentered the textbox and then deletes the content.

But this is not actually what I want to do. Since I have to setup the method Find on the mock object I also need to know how it is going to be called in my logic class.

Like thisp  precoderepositoryMock.Setupr gt r.GetQueryltCalenderTblgt.Returnsnew ListltCalenderTblgt    new CalenderTbl                  Date                new DateTime2010, 1, 1,           Year  2010       ,   new CalenderTbl                  Date                new DateTime2010, 2, 1,           Year  2010       ,   new CalenderTbl                  Date                new DateTime2011, 1, 1,           Year  2011        .AsQueryable codepre  pSo when Find is calling GetQuery internally in the GenericRepository class it should get the correct Calendar entities that I setup in GetQuery. But this is not working of course. Since I havent setup the Find method of my mock object I dont get any entities.p  pSo what to do Of course I could probably use Moles or some other framework which mocks everything but I dont want to do that. Is there anything I can do in the design of the class or test to solve the issuep  pIt is not the end of the world if I have to go with my current solution but what if the property year turns into a not nullable int Then of course I will have to change my implementation in the logic class but I would also have to change the test. I would like to try to avoid this.p

Also the pattern matching is foreign to me, I dont know if that is trivial or costly.li liMotifs If Im reading this correctly, 70 of all memory allocations are done by motifs, and Id assume that has to be garbage collected at some time. Again using the all purpose list might be slowing me down or the list comprehension, since the cost of that is incredibly unclear to me.li ol  pDoes anybody have any advice on the usual procedure here If data types are the problem, would arrays be the right answer Ive heard they come in boxesp  pThanks for the help.p  pEdit It just occurred to me that it might be useful if I describe the manner in which these two functions are calledp  precodetotalDistance  Motif gt Int totalDistance motif  sum  map minimum . map hammingDistance motif . motifs l dna codepre  pThis function is the result of another function, and is passed around nodes in a tree.

From then on its your typical branch and bound algorithm. p  pEdit John asked that I print out the change I made which virutally eliminated the cost of motifsp  precodescoreFunction  DNA gt Int gt Motif gt Int scoreFunction dna l  totalDistance     where          The sum of the minimum hamming distance in each line of dna          is given by totalDistance motif         totalDistance motif  sum  map minimum . map hammingDistance motif possibleMotifs         possibleMotifs  map motifs l dna  Previously this was computed in the line above codepre  pI didnt make it clear in my original post, but scoreFunction is only called once, and the result is passed around in a tree traversalbranch and bound and used to evaluate nodes. Recomputing motifs at every step of the way, in retrospect, isnt one of the brightest things Ive done.p

Negative 8279 pI recently had the following problem Im developing a numerical library in Python called codespuqcode that needs codescipycode at its core. Now one of the functions in scipy, its called codebtdtricode, had a bug for a certain tuple of input parameters. This bug, however, is now fixed in scipy version 0.9 according to the developers of scipy. So in my code I have something like thisp  precodeimport scipy  def fooa, b, c   if scipy.versiongt0, 9       return btdtria, b, c   else       return myfixedbtdtria, b, c codepre  pThis works, however, I dont really like to litter my code with bug fixes for third party packages. I would rather have that contained in one module, that implements the workaround, and have all the other of my modules uses the patched module automatically.p  pNow my question is what would be the best practice to handle cases like this in general E.g. write my own codespuq.contrib.scipycode and say therep  precodefrom scipy import  if version lt 0, 9   btdtri  myfixedbtdtri codepre  pand instead of importing codescipycode import codespuq.contrib.scipycode everywhere I think thats complicated and easy to forget and probably unpythonic and ugly. Maybe there is a way to hook automatically into the package loading and modify the codescipycode module directly so that every other package sees only the patched up package I think this problem is quite common, so probably there should be some bestpractices around.p

Negative 8279 h2The App Layouth2  pI am building an App, where one can create surveys. Every survey has multiple questions. I am embedding the questions into the survey model with codeembedsmanycode in Mongoid, so a survey may look like thisp  precode   id    4f300a68115eed1ddf000004,   title Example Survey,   questions    [            id      4f300a68115eed1ddf00000a,       title   Please describe your experience with backbone.js,        type    textarea     ,            title   Do you like it,        id      4f300a68115eed1ddf00000b,       type    radiobutton,       options [Yes, Yes, a lot]        ]  codepre  pNow, there is also a survey editor which consists of a codeSurveyViewcode, which displays the survey and lists the questions. If I click on a single question, a codeQuestionViewcode will pop up, where I can edit the question.

Then I can do things like fetching a codeQuestioncode out of this collection by id, pass it to the view and when I change the model, everything will get updated automatically, but I have to specify an codeurlcode in the collection, and backbone will send single questions to the server, if things get updated.p  pAny suggestion on how to do this the backbone wayp

Negative 8279 pIm writing an ASP.Net Web Forms application that has a couple of slow backend operations, so Im attempting to use UpdatePanels to perform the operations asynchronously.p  pI want these operations to be only executable one at a time, and inform other users when someone is performing one of these operations. As a quick and dirty way of doing this, I want to put up a simple modal dialog with a mask behind it, disabling access to the site while an operation is taking place. I do this in the MasterPage shared across all pages of the site.p  pI stuck the modal in an UpdatePanel, and put a timer on it to check a global variable from ApplicationState for current status. If its executing a task, display the modal, otherwise disable it by setting Visibility  False. I only want that content to update, so I ensure EnablePartialRenderingtrue in my ScriptManager and set UpdateModelContitional on the UpdatePanel. I even call .Update in the Timers Tick event.p  pSounds pretty good to me. To test, I get the modal to turn on and off randomly. So far, the timer works a treat and the modal displays and hides like a champion. Only problem is, after the second time the modal is hidden, EVERYTHING disappears.p  pSo... to being, the modal is hidden, the main page displays fine. Then the timer triggers, the modal is shown, overlaying the main page beautifully. The timer triggers again, and the modal disappears, but so does everything elsep  pI check the active html source behind by inspect element in Chrome and the content has disappearedp  pIm missing something very obvious here...p  pThis is my codep  precode    lt Master LanguageC AutoEventWireuptrue CodeBehindSite.master.cs InheritsOPTH.DesktopRollout.Website.SiteMaster gt      ltDOCTYPE html PUBLIC W3CDTD XHTML 1.0 StrictEN httpwww.w3.orgTRxhtml1DTDxhtml1strict.dtdgt     lthtml xmlnshttpwww.w3.org1999xhtml xmllangengt     lthead runatservergt         lttitlegtlttitlegt         ltlink hrefStylesSite.css relstylesheet typetextcss gt         ltaspContentPlaceHolder IDHeadContent runatservergt         ltaspContentPlaceHoldergt         ltheadgt     ltbodygt         ltform runatservergt             ltaspScriptManager IDMainSM runatserver EnablePartialRenderingTrue gt                      ltaspTimer runatserver IDCheckTimer Interval500 OnTickCheckTimerTickgtltaspTimergt              ltaspUpdatePanel runatserver IDModalUp UpdateModeConditional RenderModeBlock gt                 ltTriggersgt                     ltaspAsyncPostBackTrigger controlidCheckTimer eventnameTick gt                 ltTriggersgt             ltContentTemplategt                             ltaspPanel idmodalPnl runatservergt                     ltdiv classmodalPopupgt                         ltdiv idmodalContentgtCurrently performing task ltaspLiteral runatserver IDTaskNameLtr gt.

Transaction management was one of the issues wed have to solve.  So some insight into that would also be useful.p  pFor the moment, Im simply issuing a sql BEGIN at the start of a node server request and a ROLLBACK or COMMIT at the end.  However, Im perhaps obviously unfamiliar with the realworld issues surrounding SQL transaction management.  If someone could briefly explain the issues that the transaction management frameworks solve, Id find it useful.p  pEDIT Im using the builtin connection pooling mechanism of the postgres driver, and all queries within an http request are issued on the same connection obtained from the pool.  First the BEGIN is issued, then whatever the specific http request does, then the COMMIT or ROLLBACK.p  pThanks. p

Basically we have some very timeconsuming calls in the backend, which should run asynchronous so the user can work on. p  ul liMy first shot at this was using codeAJAXcode to post the data to the timeconsuming script and relocate the user through codejavascriptcode. li ul  pThis somewhat works but the magento sessions seem to be dependant on the php sessions  as far as I can see a user will have a session created in the directory specified in codephp.inicode and one created in codemagentovarsessioncode. p  pSince this php session is file based I wont be able to get any response from the server in the second request the redirection or any other requests within the same session before the first call the script called by codeajaxcode has finished. p  ul liMy solution to this was to memcache these session files alongside magento in order to allow these asynchronous calls. li ul  pHowever, magento cant seem recognize these sessions now that they are stored in memcache. p  pWhy is this p  pI would think that it used the standard php functions when accessing these sessions  I cant find any of these functions in the source code though, but they must be called in some way. p  pI have successfully tested that the sessions can be stored and loaded properly. I get no error messages and the log is empty. p  pAny ideas why magento cant handle this p  pIs it even an acceptable approach in order to achieve these asynchronous calls, or is there a much better solutionp  pstrongTLDRstrong Standard php sessions are being stored using memcache. Magento cant seem to recognize them. Why is thisp

Negative 8279 pDo you know if there are any plans to introduce parallel programming in R for all packages  Im aware of some developments such as Rrevolution and parallel programming packages, but they seem to have specialised functions which replace the most popular functions linear programming etc... However one of the great things about R is the huge amount of specialised packages which prop up every day and make complex and timeconsuming analysis very easy to run. Many of these use very popular functions such as the generalised linear model, but also use the results for additional calculation and comparison and finally sort out the output. As far as I understand you need to define which parts of a function can be run in parallel programming so this is probably why most specialised R packages dont have this functionality and cannot have it unless the code is edited.p  pAre there are any plans or any packages to enable all the most popular R functions to run in parallel processing so that all the less popular functions containing these can be run in parallel processing For example, the package difR uses the glm function for most of its functions if the glm package was enabled to run in parallel processing or rewritten and then released in a new R version for all multiprocessor machines then there would be no need to rewrite the difR package and this could then run some of its most burdensome procedures with the aid of parallel programming on a Windows PC.p

Negative 8279 pI want to know is this possible I learnt HTML back in the early 00s, used to have the fundamentals of PHP and javascript. Now all I remember is basic HTML, and python. Currently I have a python script that prints to a GUI Tkinter entry on repeat every couple of seconds, as defined by the user.p  pI want to do emthisem with a webpage.p  pIs it possible to print text to a dynamically updated webpage I was thinking RSS feed.. which sure, would work. But it probably wouldnt be to neat. I want to recreate my Tkinter GUI on a page and make the flashcard service available on the net. The python script retrieves values from an SQL Lite database. And as I hear python is netsafe, I dont want to learn an entirely new language such as PHP.p  pI would also like to embed the entire dynamically updated form in a drupal site if its possible to do that. Any ideas Example tutorials on using python to dynamically add text to a webpagep

Negative 8279 pI have a list of nodes each with a click. The click sends a node reference argument which loads a new view using ajax. Jquery collects the node reference number via a hidden input value on the contenttypetpl.php. Likewise the nodes in the new view each have a click which sends a node reference argument which loads a new view using ajax. However while the clicks in the original view work correctly, the clicks in the newly called view do not reference the correct node. Instead of referencing the node id for the node which is clicked, the node id of the next node in the view is collected instead. Oddly when placing codeltphp echo nodegtnidgtcode on the contenttypetpl.php, the correct node id is echoed on the page. But sadly this is not the one sent to the view argument. So clicking any node in the the newly loaded ajaxed view, sends the id for the next node. Heres the javacriptp  precodeDrupal.behaviors.ajaxlinks  function context      .morelinknot.toggprocessed, context.addClasstoggprocessed.eachfunction         var myindex  .morelink.indexthis       var target  .newthing.eqmyindex       var nid  .mynid.eqmyindex.val     this.clickfunction  if .hiddenrows.eqmyindex.ishidden     .hiddenrows.eqmyindex.show     .newthing.eqmyindex.show       var toLoad  Drupal.settings.basePath  replies  nid       xhr  .ajax         url toLoad,         success functiondata          target.htmldata      Drupal.attachBehaviorscontext    else      .hiddenrows.eqmyindex.hide     .newthing.eqmyindex.hide      return false codepre  pIts the same code so I cant see why it works differently in the newly loaded view. Can anyone spot what I am doing wrong I suspect its got something to with either the placement of or how Ive declared my variables. Or perhaps its got to do with a misuse of index , eq or thisp

Negative 8279 pThis is usually a very straight forward thing to do, so before you down vote me for such a question hear me out p  pMy problem is not selecting the elements and adding the class, its that I want the alternate class to be added to even or odd rows emrelative to that tableem.p  pRight now I am using thisp  precodejQuerydocument.readyfunction  jQuerytable.rep tbody gt tr tdfirstchild.addClasscomposer jQuerytable.rep tbody gt tr tdlastchild.addClasspieces jQuerytable.rep tbody gt trodd.addClassalt   codepre  pThe problem is that jQuery is selecting all of the rows from all of the tables with the rep class and then adding the alt class to the odd rows from that set.p  pLike I said, I want to have it apply the class to the evenodd rows relative to each table, so the first row would always be styled the same way.  As it is using the code above, the first rows can be either altnormal based on how many rows are in the previous table.p  pI was thinking of somehow using the code.eachcode function, but after looking through the jQuery docs, I havent been able to find out how to achieve my desired result.p  pIm thinking it might look something like thisp  precodejQuerytable.rep.eachfunction      selectfilter odd rows from this set and add alt class   codepre  pSo my question is if code.eachcode can be used like that and if so, how to drill down into the results of each iteration and make it do what I want.p

Negative 8279 pI have a very frustrating start learning Plone development. I would like to develop a dexterity based content type for Plone 4. Im an experienced python developer, having some knowledge of Zope and Grok, being rather new to buildout. That said, I read Professional Plone 4 Development by Martin Aspeli, but quite some version information in the book seems to be outdated.p  pUsing buildout I was able to get a Plone instance up and running. ZopeSkel is installed but when I try to create a new package, I get an error like thisp  precode   Your new package supports local commands.  To access them, change   directories into the src directory inside your new package.

I tried different versions of ZopeSkel and tried the raw plone templates and also zopeskel.dexterity.

To create a command, I use a call like that one  p  precodemCommandFactory.createCommandlt                         DoSomeStuff,                          ParameterType1,                          ParameterType2,                          ParameterType3,                          ParameterType4                         gt                         stdstringsome description,                           parameter1,                           parameter2,                           parameter3,                           parameter4 codepre  pAs you probably have guessed, parameter1 type is ParameterType1, and so on ... . p  pNow if we look at the definition of the command  DoSomeStuff itself  p  precodeclass DoSomeStuff  public UndoableCommandlt ParameterType1 , ParameterType2, ParameterType3 , ParameterType4 gt          public       DoSomeStuff...  arguments which are needed for precessing the command and undoing it        DoSomeStuff throw       void executeImpl       void undoImpl      protected               ...  members which are needed for precessing the command and undoing it       codepre  pAs you can see, ParameterTypeN information is already inside DoSomeStuff declaration.p  pI was wondering if it was possible somehow to replace the createCommand call above by something simpler p  precodemCommandFactory.createCommandltDoSomeStuffgt                         stdstringsome description,                           parameter1,                           parameter2,                           parameter3,                           parameter4 codepre  pHere is the CommandFactory code  p  precode    class CommandFactory          private            some stuff used to initialize objects created by this factory       public         CommandFactory...  ...  members initialization                                 template ltclass CommandType, typename P1, typename P2, typename P3, typename P4gt          void createCommandjuceStringamp description,P1 p1, P2 p2, P3 p3, P4 p4                      Undoable cmdPtr  new CommandTypep1, p2, p3, p4             ...              init cmdPtr              cmdPtr                      codepre  pBasically the point would be to move the complexity inside CommandFactory, to keep the client code the call to createCommand as simple and short as possible. p  pAny ideas  p

Negative 8279 pI am working on a card game project in C. In this game, there are numerous events that are fired that the cards on the table need to subscribe to. However, I need the cards to dynamically subscribe and unsubscribe to the events so that the cards that are not currently active will not respond to the events being fired. p  pMy solution for this is to use an EventManager parent class, with one child for each event. Each of these managers will have subscribe  unsubscribe methods that take an EventHandler as a parameter. When called, the methods will subscribe  unsubscribe the provided handlers from the event assigned to that manager.p  pThe code below is a basic Console application that uses the same design pattern as my card game, and has the same issues.

Negative 8279 pWorking on a large project which has spawned a new side project. Not quite a child of the first, more like a plugin of substantial size. For various reasons we have decided to develop this new project in a repository separate from our main products repo. Both products are Maven based and share an Artifactory repository.p  pWith this separation, I have also decided to implement a new integration environment which executes nightly builds of unit and integration tests and uses Sonar to apply Checkstyle and Findbugs analysis.p  pId like ensure that developers and the integration environment of both products remain in sync i.e. developers are using the same Checkstyle and Findbugs rules as the integration environment is. Im struggling to define a simple mechanism to do this which does not require new developers to do a lot of manual environment setup.p  pIm attempting to create an IDE agnostic code base i.e. we dont check in .eclipse, .project, etc. Ive been looking at several approaches including publishing Checkstyle and Findbugs configuration in a Maven extension artefact. Ideally, these configurations would reside under version control as a dependency but not owning to either of the projects. Changes to the configurations would somehow be propagated to the developer environment and integration environment as transparently as possible.p  pPreviously we used workspace mechanic to setup Eclipse. Im not entirely against workspace mechanic, but I am wanting to explore alternatives that cater for both the developer environment and headless integration environment equally as well.p

Negative 8279 pI spent half of the day today unsuccessfully trying to install a hrefhttpsgithub.comcppnetlibcppnetlib relnofollowcppnetliba on Mac OS X the goal is to implement asynchronous http requests in C. When I do make to build and run the tests, I have lots of no matching constructor errors coming from Boost. Having read a hrefhttpsgithub.comcppnetlibcppnetlibissues123 relnofollowthisa, I tried installing different versions of Boost 1.49, 1.50, 1.51, but that didnt help. So Im at the point of thinking of alternatives to cppnetlib. One possibility is to use Boost.Asio directly, but it would have been great to use something like cppnetlib as it is much easier to use once its installed. Any alternatives to cppnetlib which come to mind Or any other way I should try to make cppnetlib pass the tests Thanks in advancep

Negative 8279 pI just finished a project that uses ASP.NET MVC, jQuery and jQueryUI. One of the pages I wrote is still bugging me because I ended up writing a lot of clientside code for event handlers and it grew out of control due to the complexity of the interactions of the controls on the page and their states the page is very interactive and has a google docs feel to it. My question is what best practices are available for clientside development specifically using jQuery amp jQueryUI that have complex interactions like google docs or yahoos mail client My biggest complaint I had with my code is that for almost all my event handlers, I ended up writing a lot of if statements that executed code based on the states of other controls on the page. It seems like there has to be a way to handle this in a more controlled manner.p

Negative 8279 pI have a silverlight app that uses the default startup loading progress bar. It used to start from 0 and gradually move to 100.

Negative 8279 pSalutation WIX users,p  pIve encounter a weird issue with one of our patches recently and Im really lost. Tried to understand the problem for 3 days and still nothing so Im sending my question your way with hopes someone might see something. It concerns the hotfix 7 of a build that has already seen 6 successful patches  .msp  so it had functional hotfixes before.p  pWhen I install the build followed by that hotfix on, lets say a windows server 2003, everything seems to install itself correctly. However under a server 2008 the installation fails with the error message  p  pError applying patch to file CConfig.MsiPT1E0D.tmp. It has probably been updated by another mean and can no longer be modified by this patch.p  pAfter looking in the log it seems to be related to the dll Coveo.ces.web.search.dll installed under the folder bin  and not the copy in the GAC . But I mean, nothing should have changed since the original installation.p  pI would think it is due to the windows installer version that is used  3.0 under server 2003 and 4.0 under server 2008  but I havent found anything that would support that.p  pIve encountered that error once before and it was due to the fact that we were installing 2 identical files in the GAC that were overwriting each other but in that case, it never happened on the first hotfix always the second and it did not vary depending on the system.p  pThe PCP files are pretty similar as the msi built to generate the msp. Ive compared the failing hotfix 7 log with a successful installation of hotfix 6 and here what I think are are the major differences around the dll Coveo.ces.web.search in chronological order  and If you need the complete log just ask and it will be my pleasure to send it to you.p  pThank you for your help, NickLp

Negative 8279 pWe test an application developed in house using a python test suite which accomplishes web navigationsinteractions through Selenium WebDriver.  A tricky part of our web testing is in dealing with a series of pdf reports in the app.  We are testing a planned upgrade of Firefox from v3.6 to v16.0.1, and it turns out that the way we captured reports before no longer works, because of changes in the directory structure of firefoxs temp folder.  I didnt write the original pdf capturing code, but I will refactor it for whatever we end up using with v16.0.1, so I was wondering if there s a better way to save a pdf using Pythons selenium webdriver bindings than what were currently doing.p  pPreviously, for Firefox v3.6, after clicking a link that generates a report, we would scan the CDocuments and SettingsLocal SettingsTempplugtmp directory for a pdf file with a specific name convention to be generated.  To be clear, were not saving the report from the webpage itself, were just using the one generated in firefoxs Temp folder.p  pIn Firefox 16.0.1, after clicking a link that generates a report, the file is generated in CDocuments and Settings Local SettingsTemptmpcache, with a random file name, not ending in .pdf.  This makes capturing this file somewhat more difficult, if using a technique similar to our previous one  each browser has a different tmp folder, which has a cache full of folders, inside of which the report is generated with a random file name.p  pThe easiest solution I can see would be to directly save the pdf, but I havent found a way to do that yet.p  pTo use the same approach as we used in FF3.6 finding the pdf in the Temp folder directory, Im thinking well need to do the followingp  ol liFigure out which tmp folder belongs to this particular browser instance which we can do be inspecting the tmp folders that exist before and after the browser is instantiatedli liLook inside that browsers cache for a file generated immedaitely after the pdf report was generated which we can by comparing timestampsli liIn cases where multiple files are generated in the cache, we could possibly sort based on size, and take the largest file, since the pdf will almost certainly be the largest temp file although this seems flaky and will need to be tested in practice.li ol  pIm not feeling great about this approach, and was wondering if theres a better way to capture pdf files.  Can anyone suggest a better approachp  pNote the actual scraping of the PDF file is still working fine.p

But as soon as I publish the ASP.NET site to the IIS 6 on our server, callback are never received by the ASP.NET app. Both are in the application pool. p  pIs there a setting, or something I need to be looking for to have the ASP.NET to keep open the listening port for the callbacks The XBAP is still receiving the callbacks, no problem.p  pThe service config is as follows note I have maxed out the buffers because of simplicity for the moment to rule that outp  precodeltconfigurationgt   ltsystem.diagnosticsgt     ltsourcesgt       ltsource propagateActivitytrue nameSystem.ServiceModel switchValueWarning,ActivityTracinggt         ltlistenersgt           ltadd typeSystem.Diagnostics.DefaultTraceListener nameDefaultgt             ltfilter type gt           ltaddgt           ltadd nameServiceModelTraceListenergt             ltfilter type gt           ltaddgt         ltlistenersgt       ltsourcegt     ltsourcesgt     ltsharedListenersgt        ltadd initializeDatawebtracelog.svclog typeSystem.Diagnostics.XmlWriterTraceListener, System, Version4.0.0.0, Cultureneutral, PublicKeyTokenb77a5c561934e089     nameServiceModelTraceListener traceOutputOptionsTimestampgt         ltfilter type gt       ltaddgt     ltsharedListenersgt   ltsystem.diagnosticsgt   ltsystem.webgt     ltcompilation debugtrue targetFramework4.0 gt   ltsystem.webgt   ltsystem.serviceModelgt     ltbindingsgt      ltwsDualHttpBindinggt         ltbinding receiveTimeout000100 sendTimeout000005 maxReceivedMessageSize2147483647       messageEncodingText textEncodingutf8gt           ltreaderQuotas maxDepth2147483647 maxStringContentLength2147483647         maxArrayLength2147483647 maxBytesPerRead2147483647 maxNameTableCharCount2147483647 gt           ltsecurity modeNone gt         ltbindinggt       ltwsDualHttpBindinggt     ltbindingsgt     ltbehaviorsgt             ltserviceBehaviorsgt         ltbehaviorgt          ltserviceMetadata httpGetEnabledtruegt          ltserviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaultstruegt         ltbehaviorgt       ltserviceBehaviorsgt     ltbehaviorsgt     ltserviceHostingEnvironment aspNetCompatibilityEnabledfalse   multipleSiteBindingsEnabledfalse gt     ltprotocolMappinggt       ltadd schemehttp bindingwsDualHttpBinding gt     ltprotocolMappinggt   ltsystem.serviceModelgt   ltsystem.webServergt     ltmodules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequeststruegt     ltdirectoryBrowse enabledtruegt    ltsystem.webServergt ltconfigurationgt codepre  pThe service has methods where clients will subscribe to callback lists.

Negative 8279 pI am developing a Python application to transfer files using TCP and is new to Python language. I have already coded out the client side code and server side code and it is working if I run them individually. Unfortunately, I needed to put them all together in a same file, ie. main.py, that will run the server side code and client side code. For example, every network node should act as a server and client at the same time. Thus, I will need it to constantly listen for new requests from other nodes so need to run the server side code and at the same time send new requests to other nodes that acts as server so in this case, it is acting as a client. I have thought of using threading but kept getting stuck at the server side codes thread.p  pheres an example of my main.py code that deals with the threading.p  precodeif name  main     serverThreadstop  Event     serverThread  Threadtarget  TCPServer, args  1111,test.txt     serverThread.start     serverThread.join     clientThreadstop  Event     clientThread  Threadtarget  TCPClient, args  127.0.0.1,1111,test.txt     clientThread.start     clientThread.join     clientThreadstop.set     serverThreadstop.set codepre  pAs Im quite new to Python and socket programming so I might have made some mistakes with the threading code.

Negative 8279 pI am interested in make better programs with more responsive design and capabilities. Nowadays, when I create my programs that access data remotely, my interface freezes and there is no animated GIF to work on that condition.p  pI was told by David Hefferman that animated GIF that are created in the VCL do not respond even in threads because the VCL is in the main thread, and the same goes to databases.p  pMy doubt here is how to work with threads, specifically in databases, so I have lots of questions about it.p  pDo I have to implement my entire database in thread functions and procedures If that is correct, then I cant use database by dropping components to the Form, right  But what about the user input and grids Will they work correctly with those threads or will I have to user regular codeTEditcode instead of codeTDBEditcode to then send its content to a insertupdate sql commandp  pThe main objective in here is to create Delphi application that access remote databases like MySQL using Zeos but not freezing for every drop of consult made in the server. At least the smaller ones. It would be very ugly if the system were to download a list of records to a table and the user could still input things. For those cases I would like very much that my animated GIF or other solutions could work.p  pemThank you for any help at allemp

Negative 8279 pIm learning node.js and interested in is there any difference between following two cases. I.E. I have some variable codemyvarcode like db connection or just constant string test that needed to be passed in many modules and submodules. p  pFirst case. Create modules, that accept that variable as a paramp  psubmodule.jsp  precodevar option   , submodule   submodule.func  function     ...     var something  option     ...  module.exports  functionopts     option  opts     return submodule  codepre  pmodule1.jsp  precodevar option   , submodule   , module1   module1.func  function     ...     submodule.func     ...     var something  option     ...  module.exports  functionopts     option  opts     submodule  require.submoduleopts     return module1  codepre  pIn this case if submodule is used in several modules with same codemyvarcode value i.e. 2 modules submodules codemodule.exportscode function will be called 2 times. In node.js mans it said that Modules are cached after the first time they are loaded. And I cant understand is this module cached or not.p  pAnother case That codemyvarcode can be passed as parameter to module functions. So code will look likep  psubmodule.jsp  precodefunction funcoption     ...     var something  option     ...  exports.func  func codepre  pmodule1.jsp  precodevar submodule  require.submodule function funcoption     ...     submodule.funcoption     ...     var something  option     ...  exports.func  func codepre  pSo the question is  Is there any difference between this two cases or they are samep

Negative 8279 pWhen dealing with microcontrollers there are things that are inherently global  Im thinking about peripherals like serial ports or other interfaces. There are also peripherals that are not only global but there is only one and there will never be more  like peripheral controlling core clocks or interrupt controller. These peripherals do have some kind of global state for example  core clock is set to something and its inefficient to reversecalculate these values.p  pIf Id like my program to be nicely objectoriented, Im having hard time deciding how to deal with such objects... Global variables are not nice and this is obvious, but I just dont know not enough experience whether I should try to hide the fact that these things ARE global... For example cin or stdout are globals too lets ignore the fact that in multithreaded apps these are usually threadspecific and noone is hiding that... Lets stick with the clock generator peripheral  there is only one, so I could use the singleton antipattern  or make the class static or just have the single object global thats what I have usually done, as this object has the current clock setting stored and this value is needed for LOTS of other things  its needed to set system timer used by RTOS, its needed to set clocks for other peripherals UART baudrate, SPI bitrate, ..., its needed to set correct clock for external memories or configure memory wait states. Thats why I think that creating one object in main and passing it around everywhere would be a bit cumbersome...p  pI could write the methods so that all global information would come from the peripheral registers for example the core frequency could be reversecalculated from current PLL settings, but this also seems like a wrong idea, not to mention that creating object for clock generator peripheral everywhere would look funny...p  pCurrent clock setting could be stored in static member of the class, but from here theres only one small step towards a fully static class as this pointer will be useless for a class that has no state...p  pThe solution usually found in notobjectoriented programs is closest to fully static class  there are only functions that operate on global variables.p  pAnyone has some nice idea how to deal with such scenario nicely or whether this problem is worth the time Maybe I should just use one global object and be done with it p

Negative 8279 pIm creating a list with handles for sorting. I dont like the aesthetics of having 20 handles visible, so Im trying to make the handles appear only when the mouse hovers over a list item.p  pThis was my first attemptp  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netscottbpk9ch1 relnofollowjsFiddle 1ap  pAs you can see, hovering over items in the list creates a rather jarring movement and misalignment of list items. To fix this, Ive created a blank 16px image that I use to replace the handle when its not visible. It creates a much nicer user experience than hovering, as you can see herep  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netscottb88BPQ relnofollowjsFiddle 2ap  precodethis.prependltimg srchttpi.imgur.comtzGrVLc.png classblanksprite  width16 height16 border0gt codepre  pThe problem is that during sorting the 16px image often disappears, leaving things out of alignment. Id post an image but I dont have the reputation. It doesnt always happen, but seems to happen more frequently when Im sorting very quickly.p  pId love to know why this happens and how to fix it.

However yoxos always installs the old version.p  pHere is what I have tried without successp  ul liremove the plugin via the web interface and reinstall itli liremove the update site via the web interface and add it againli ul  pWhat I have not tried is to create a new update site But that is a bit annoying to create a new update site for every minor version I want to install.p  pWhat is the trick to tell yoxos to flush its cachesp

Negative 8279 pI am having an odd issue when using the filesize method from the boost library. If the path that I try to dereference using a directory iterator is not the current path where the executable is, then I get a value of 0 for any file sizes I try to return. So if my path variable is instantiated to . for the current folder it will return byte sizes no problem but if I go one folder up or a path anywhere on the C drive the byte size of files is not returned. Is this an issue with scope or is there something Im missingp

Negative 8279 pI have radio groups set up in my template and I want to prefill these tags using the REST API.p  pPlease dont ask for code andor requestresponse dumps.

This page also doesnt mention anything about prefilling the values for a recipient. But its linked from a hrefhttpwww.docusign.compRESTAPIGuideContentREST20API20ReferencesRecipientsSigners20Recipient.htm relnofollowherea see codetabscode anyway. There is a bit of information herep  precodevalue if an X, this is the selected radio button. Only one radio button in a group can be selected. codepre  pAnd then just before this it saysp  precodeselected Sets if this is radio button is selected. Use truefalse to show the value is selected or not. Only one radio button can be true. codepre  pSo we learn there are only just two ways to specify a radio widget selected. Of course this applies when you are creating the widget.p  pNevertheless I tried to make requests assuming this would also work for prefilling I got this helpful error messagep  precode   errorCode UNSPECIFIEDERROR,   message Object reference not set to an instance of an object.  codepre  pWhen I search the support forum Ive found a hrefhttpcommunity.docusign.comt5DocuSignAPIIntegrationNETUsingCreateEnvelopeFromTemplatesAndFormswithradiobuttonsmp3259highlighttrueM274 relnofollowthisa, its not exactly the same with my problem, Id be happy to be able to set the wrong radio widget selected as opposed to getting the codeUNSPECIFIEDERRORcode but this post is about the XML API.p  pI started my frantical search for the new topic button, it is so well placed you can usually find it in less than 10 minutes. I remember I used to go to my profile and then click something there... Then I did what every rational developer would do in the first place and went back to the post URL and read the breadcrumbs codeDev Zonecode section was renamed as codeDev Zone MOVED TO STACK OVERFLOW  Use tag DocuSignAPIcode.

Even if this makes much sense it worries me for the reason of its impact on speedperformance. It seems that each time a lot of initialization is emredoneem.p  h1The questionh1  pKnowing that the HTTP protocol a stateless protocol, it would appear to me that for each request that is sent to the server, it is necessary to run through all possible initialisations done in the PHPCGI code over and over again.

Negative 8279 pMy iOS application relies heavily on GPS and I tried writing a method that helps conserve battery but I am having little success.p  pI created an NSTimer that fired every 15 seconds. Every time the method was called, it would increment an int time up by 1. If int time reached 205 minutes it would turn off the location updates and set a bool isStopped to true. Every time the method ran and int time was above 20, it would increment another int, int time2, up by 1. If the method was ran and int time2 was equal to 4, it would start the location updates again and set time2 to 0.p  pThen in the didUpdateLocation method for the location manager, I have an algorithm that would first check if the bool isStopped was true, if it was true then it would check the new locations horizontal accuracy and make sure it was under 10. Then it would check the newLocation with a location object named coords and check to see if they were greater than 9 meters apart. If they were not, it would stop location updates again and return. If they were, it would continue to another algorithm where it would check the new location object against some arguments. If it passed the coords location object would be set with the new location object, the time and time2 ints would be set to 0, the isStopped would be set to false, and the whole process would start all over again.p  pIn short, after 5 minutes of no location changes, the location updates would be stopped and periodically checked every 1 minute to see if the user had moved at least 10 meters from the previous location that passed all requirements. When the user does move far enough, it starts the process all over again and the user has to not move 10 or more meters for 5 minutes before it starts the periodic checks. The thought behind this is to do only few second checks every minute when the user isnt moving much instead of constantly having the location services running.p  pNow heres the problem I run into, when the location updates stop. The NSTimer stops running while the app is in the background.p  pCould I somehow schedule a background task to run the loop between the 1 minute checks Does anyone have any better ideas Or any ideas on solutions to thisp

Negative 8279 pI have an image slideshow viewer that uses a UIPageViewController to present the images. The imageview viewer ViewController is pretty simple  a toplevel view containing a UIScrollView containing a UIImageView.  On initial image presentation or when the device is rotated the image is aspectfitted to the view dimensions and centered.  It works fine except for a problem which happens on both iOS 7 and iOS 6.p  pIf I am in the middle of panning to change images and two images are on the screen and I then rotate the device it sometimes maybe always messes up the display of one or more images.  The previouslycentered image appears in the wrong place on the screen and this persists when rotated and zoomed.p  pThe only thing I can find emwrongem when this happens is that the center property of the UIImageView is not, in fact, the center of the frame.  If I change the center property of the UIImageView in viewDidAppear to be the center of the possiblyscaled UIImageView then the images seem to display correctly in all cases.p  pDoes this sound like the effect of some familiar mistake that Im making p  pEdit to respond to the questionbr I dont do anything in the willRotate or didRotate methods.br In strongviewDidLayoutSubviewsstrong I aspectfit the image into the current UIScrollView bounds which is the full toplevel view which is the full screen and center it.  This takes care of both the initial presentation and rotations.  I dont see any problems in normal rotation situations.  The problem occurs only when I rotate with two of the pageViewControllers children views both partly onscreen at once.  I can fix the problem in all cases but surely Im doing something wrong.p  pEdit 2br Ive discovered another anomaly that occurs less frequently when rotating the device while panning with 2 images onscreen.  Best explained by an examplep  pThe page view controller is being used to display one image in a sequence of images from left to right of A B C.  Image B is onscreen.  During a pan to the left you see part of both images A and B.  If the pan to image A is nearly complete, i.e. B is nearly offscreen, and you rotate the device then image B normally ends up onscreen it never rotates still showing the partial pan, but sometimes image C ends up being displayed  as though you had panned in the other direction.  Anybody else see this kind of behaviorp
Negative 8279 pIm having trouble validating the existence of REGISTER.txt for input purposes in a function see below.

Negative 8279 pI am using an open source graphing library, oxyplot, in a c wpf application. I am running into an issue where the UI thread is blocked when updating the graphs canvas object. Due to the canvas object belonging to the UI thread the update is done on the UI thread. p  pI have already moved all code I can to run on background threads, but the actual draw of the canvas isnt as easily solved.p  pThe writer of the library tried with this piece of a hrefhttpsgist.github.comoeb7418988 relnofollowcodea using a scheduler from the UI threads synchronization context but still couldnt get around the UI thread blocking when writing to the canvas.p  pThe example above does work pretty much like the plotting library does so I wont give any of the code for that here. p  pHow could I implement this without blocking the UI threadp  pEDITp  pHere is a snippet of my code  it shows how ive attempted to implement this. You can see that I create the path data in the first bit of code. When im finished I attempt to loop round these on the UI Thread and add them to the canvas.

Negative 8279 pI want to use the Unix mail command to send emails that include an InReplyTo header record.  Under some Linux versions it seems I can use a to add arbitrary header records, but on some versions that doesnt seem to be available.  Also, I need to do this on AIX, where the mail command seems to have far fewer options than on Linux.  Im running as a regular user not root, and the SAs seem to have set up sendmail.p  pAs some background  I monitor several Unix servers via cronfired shell scripts that run every ten minutes and send an email if conditions arise that need attention.  Sometimes several scripts on several servers are emailing at once, every ten minutes, and the number of emails is quite high.  The new mobile device I use to receive these emails cant group email by any attribute other than by conversation, and so, to keep some sanity to that devices inbox I want to control the InReplyTo of these emails.p

Negative 8279 pI have an application which has two activities codeAcode and codeBcode. When application is installed and run for the first time then it always starts with codeAcode as it is declared as launcher activity in manifest. p  pAccording to workflow, after a few seconds, activity codeAcode is destroyed and activity codeBcode is started. So that, the root of task becomes codeBcode. Now, when user presses the home button and later comes to our app, activity codeBcode is resumed as expected. But, if application is left in background for a long time then the application is restarted as from the logs codeApplicationonCreatecode is called. However, I want that whenever the application restarts that is whenever codeApplicationonCreatecode is called like in the second case activity codeAcode should be started instead of B, in all other cases when application is not restarted activity codeBcode should be appearing. I am new to android and unable to figure out a solution. Any help is much appreciated.p  pThanks in advance.  p

Negative 8279 pSo I designed this page locally on my Mac OSX which runs on NodeJSExpress. Once I deployed and got my app running on my server and opened the page, I noticed it looked differently. I  then went on and accessed them both side by side with the same browser on the same machine and saw the differences. p  pFor some reason the viewport although they were the exact same showed different values in the Dev Tools. Weird. All my elements were bigger, as if they were zoomed in. So then I decided to add zoom0.9 to my body and after that it looked exactly the same.p  pI then proceeded to check all my pages to see if it was a problem with the page or with all of them and I saw that it as the same for all my pages.

Negative 8279 pI have built an application based on HotTowel template and so far it looks great. With a minor problem... It has no account management. SimpleMembership and SimpleRole have been implemented and so far everything works as intended. Accounts are based on ASP.NET MVC SPA template. What I can do is  add new Users only in Seed method there should be no register, only administrator can add people and once they are set, they cant be changed. It is not a problem to include views from SPA template and use those for management, but that doesnt fit into HotTowel very well. Only login fits into this, and logout is being handled in a weird way  hidden  written in index.cshtml and then being called withp  pcode.hiddenLogoutForm.submitcodep  pThe question is  how should I handle account management with currently built application Would this be the time to introduce 2nd breeze manager to handle UserContext or is there any better way Considering I already use AccountController for login and logout, would it be good to make BreezeAccountController or similar name just for breeze readwrites Would loginlogout still work as intended if I just added code[BreezeController]code decorator to AccountController How to best connect Roles and User info Password changes Only UserProfile is visible in the context by default so any other change will have to be saved through some other Action method. Is it worth trying with breeze or just simply write ajax callsp  pAny suggestions are welcome.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 8279 pIve been searching for an answer to my problem, but none of the solutions so far have helped me solve it. Im working on an app that communicates with another device that works as a server. The app sends queries to the server and receives appropriate responses to dynamically create fragments.p  pIn the first implementation the app sent the query and then waited to receive the answer in a single thread. But that solution wasnt satisfactory since the app did not receive any feedback from the server. The server admin said he was receiving the queries, however he hinted that the device was sending the answer back too fast and that the app probably wasnt already listening by the time the answer arrived.p  pSo what I am trying to achieve is create seperate threads one for listening and one for sending the query. The one that listens would start before we sent anything to the server, to ensure the app does not miss the server response.p  pImplementing this so far hasnt been succesful. Ive tried writing and running seperate Runnable classes and AsyncTasks, but the listener never received an answer and at some points one of the threads didnt even execute.

Stack tracep  precodeat System.Net.Dns.GetAddrInfoString name at System.Net.Dns.InternalGetHostByNameString hostName, Boolean includeIPv6 at System.Net.Dns.GetHostEntryString hostNameOrAddress at System.Runtime.Remoting.Channels.CoreChannel.GetMachineIp at System.Runtime.Remoting.Channels.Tcp.TcpServerChannel.SetupMachineName at System.Runtime.Remoting.Channels.Tcp.TcpServerChannel..ctorIDictionary properties, IServerChannelSinkProvider sinkProvider, IAuthorizeRemotingConnection authorizeCallback at System.Runtime.Remoting.Channels.Tcp.TcpServerChannel..ctorIDictionary properties, IServerChannelSinkProvider sinkProvider at Some.Namespace.Server.Start codepre  pHowever, after some research I found out that the problem is the codeCoreChannel.GetMachineIpcode method. I found the code of the codeCoreChannelcode class a hrefhttpwww.dotnetframework.orgdefault.aspx4040untmpDEVDIVTFSDev10ReleasesRTMRelndpclrsrcManagedLibrariesRemotingChannelsCORECoreChannelcs1305376CoreChannelcs relnofollowherea and noticed, that the codeDns.GetHostEntrystring hostNameOrAddresscode method is called twice. In the first call the return value of the codeDns.GetHostNamecode method which correctly returns my computer name, lets say we got hostname here is passed as argument while in the second call the returned codeIPHostEntry.HostNamecode is passed. Here is where the problem occurs Since my computer is inside a domain lets call it domain, the returned codeIPHostEntry.HostNamecode contains hostname.domain instead of just hostname. The second codeDns.GetHostEntryhostname.domaincode call then throws an exception because hostname.domain is not known.p  pThere is a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3263257systemruntimeremotingchannelscorechannelgetmachineipfromnetreflectorsimilar questiona, but it didnt help me in any way.p  pI dont know why this thing is working that way, but I cant change my computer name or the domain, so I am stuck at this point and really need some help.p  pI am using Windows 7 64bit if it matters, VS Professional 2012 Update 4 and .NET Framework 4.5.p  pThanks for the helpp
Negative 8279 pTo best describe the question, ill begin with the following scenariop  pSuppose i have a poker game The player is allowed to use credit in order to purchase some goods.p  pIf the player executes two purchase orders at the same time theoretically, two workers may handle this request simultaneously and there could be an integrity error, thus the application must make sure that there is only one or less orders executing for a single player at a given time.p  pJust to make sure that the scenario is clear  there could be hundreds of orders executing simultaneously  but for different playersp  pFollowing the 12Factor guidelines, i should be able to scale out the workers which actually process the purchase orders.p  pHow can i make sure that only one order or less is executing for a single player at a given time with an elegant solutionp  pThanks in advance, Erik.p

Negative 8279 pI gave up I tried my best to fix the problem but I have no clue. My problem is dealing with the resolution, the width, and the different computers. I manage to organize the page the way I wanted on my computer but every time I go check it on another computer I get frustrated. I dont know if someone could take a look at my CSS code and HTML code and give me some feedback I would, really, appreciate it. My images move and overlap with the text and other images when I try resizing the page. The footer moves up if I opened the page on a larger screen. I dont want the scroll bar to appear unless if its needed. Normally a good page everything will stay where it supposed to be and if you resize the page the scroll bar appears and allows you to see what you are interested in. I placed 4 images on the bottom of the page web and 3 on top.  I would appreciate it if someone could help with these issues.

Negative 8279 pHi all I download the Gtk3.0 documentation to my hard drive and deploy it on doc on my linux  root file system. And Ive created a symbolic link to the docindex.html but when it navigate to other pages it uses the symbolic address as the relative path.p  pfor a example I have symbolic link to docindex.html at rootDesktop like this     ln S gtkdocs.html docindex.htmlp  pThe index.html page loads fine. But lcewesel uses command line parameter as the URL, so it does not symbolically expanded. The correct behavior should be expand the symbolic link first and then load the original location into the URL if its a symbolic link.p  pAny fix up or workaround for this issue p

Negative 8279 pIve got a problem. My AdMob has been set up for some time now without any problem, but I noticed something wrong. Ad gets successfully loaded i see message from ddms, but it wont show. It will get shown after periodical 60 seconds refresh or when I open up login to google plus. The problem happens only with Google Play Services AdMob and not with AdMobSDK jar. Id switch to AdMob jar, however Im using Google Play Game Services for leaderboards and achievements.p  pI suspect the problem is with view not being shown, or inproper settings.p  pSo again, ad will show itself after 60 seconds along with ad refresh of waiting, or when I fire up the log in screen for google play services.p  pIm adding my code, also I should mention that Ive switched to new AdMob website and I repeat, that problem is not happening if I use AdMob jar file the ad is then shown in 23 seconds like normal. Ive cut the google play game services code they dont affect this issue because ive tried in my other app without them, and the problem is still there.p  pMainActivity codep  precodepublic class

Negative 8279 pAlthough Ive worked with C for a while, Ive recently switched gears to attempt a project in ActionScript 3 on Adobe Flash CS4. This is my first real attempt at code in Flash. What Im trying to do is essentially fake the physics of a rocket. What Im making is a scrolling shooter, and Im using tweens to move a rocketship from left to right with easing.p  pMy problem is dynamic easing. I have it set up so when you press either the Left or Right arrow key Ill continue to make an example of pressing Left, a Tween moves the ship to the corresponding direction with Regular.easeIn until you let go of the key. Then it uses another tween with Regular.easeOut to slow you down. But lets say that you let go of the Left key, and then press it again. It immediately cancels your velocity to ease you in to another tween. I dont want this. Is there any way to make a tween or engineer one so that it doesnt start with zero velocity with ActionScript, of coursep

Negative 8279 pIm working on a project involving using data from PubMed to find connections between MeSH Terms and Articles theyre mentioned in. The Neo4j DB Ive built for it contains 11M nodes and 100M relationships and Im experiencing extremely slow query times 30 min or greater in a lot of cases, including queries as simple as codeMatch aMeSHTermlt[Mentions]bArticle WHERE a.nameCalcimycin RETURN bcode i.e. just looking for all nodes with a Mentions relationship to the node w name Calcimycin. This is all being done on a university blade running Ubuntu 12.04 with a very limited amount of RAM according to the free command, 3G of RAM, 2 of which are in use by applications other than neo4j. Right now, the wrapper config sets the minimum java heap size at 16mb and the max at 64 mb though the difference in used memory when neo4j is running and when it is not is 1G any explanation on where the rest of that GB is being used. p  ol liIm not sure how much more I can expand the heap size without butting into the swap file, since free tells me Im using all of the available RAM when neo4j is running andli liif we need to expand to a stronger system with more RAM in order to obtain reasonable query times. Any suggestions would be much appreciated, and Im happy to clarify wherever I can, though Im still new to working with Ubuntu in general.li ol  pUpdate After adding an index on the label MeSHTerm, query time has improved to onaverage 11s, based on 100 randomized tests of the query. Anything more I can do Id love to bring it down to subsecond times, as this is eventually going to be a webbased tool.p

Negative 8279 pI am currently creating a project which wil grab live data from a COM port for me and then display it for easy interpretation. Part of that is creating line graphs with Dynamic Data Display, which I want to happen live as well.p  pI currently have a working setup that pulls together data from a collection and outputs it in a readable format for the plotter, while this is just fine for my static sample data, I fear this is far from optimized considering that the data will update a lot sometimes multiple times per second. Always sending a notification that data changed makes the graph refresh, but always pulling all data and creating a new graph source seems far from efficient. Im using the following code in my view modelp  precodeprivate CompositeDataSource AccelXData public CompositeDataSource AccelXData      get              var xData  new EnumerableDataSourceltintgtdataItems.Selectv gt v.id         xData.SetXMappingx gt x         var yData  new EnumerableDataSourceltdoublegtdataItems.Selectv gt v.accelX         yData.SetYMappingy gt y         AccelXData  xData.JoinyData         return AccelXData       codepre  pI have multiple of those running, each representing one graph e.g. acceleration on the x,y and z axis. They are bound to following example chartp  precodeltd3ChartPlotter Nameplotter DockPanel.DockTop Margin5gt     ltd3LineGraph DataSourceBinding AccelXData gt     ltd3LineGraph DataSourceBinding AccelYData gt     ltd3LineGraph DataSourceBinding AccelZData gt ltd3ChartPlottergt codepre  pTwo things I would like to know about this Is it possible to write one function to handle all data output, in a way that I dont have to copy the same code over and over And more importantly, what would be the best way to simply add values to my line graphs as soon as my Collection updates instead of regathering all data over and overp

Negative 8279 pI have a table which updates every few seconds using an Ajax call. The table was becoming pretty unresponsive when there were a few thousand items in it. The main bottleneck is Tablesorter.js updating the table reapplying filters, sorting and pagination, which is understandable as it has a lot of data to process.p  pI have increased performance somewhat by caching the last array of objects returned and then using underscore to compare it to the new one received and only updating the table if there has been a change, in the fashion....p  precodevar cachedJobData  .ajax     type  GET,     cache  false,     url  jobs,     success  functiondata         console.logGetNow   got data         Items  data          if.isEqualItems, cachedJobData             console.logDATA THE SAME                  else             console.logDATA DIFFERENT             rebuildTable                   cachedJobData  data     ,     error functionXhr, status, error         toastr.errorError getting job list    error     ,     alwaysfunctiondata         ifdata.loginResult  false             onLoggedOut                 function rebuildTable      var tblbody       .eachItems, functionindex, item         tblbody  makeRowitem           dbTable tbody.htmltblbody      table.triggerupdate  codepre  p...this works a lot better than previously, and has greatly improved performance, but I think it could be better.p  pWhen Tablesorter has to update a table of 5000ish rows each with 12 cells using codetable.triggerupdatecode it tends to take a good few seconds, and the page is unresponsive for this time.p  pMy question is, how can I improve on this One thing that crossed my mind was to look up each object individually in the current and cached array, and push any differences to another array so I end up with an update array and then apply that to the table by looking up each row by an ID field that I store, then telling Tablesorter to only update those rows. This seems cumbersome though.p  pI am looking to use Angular eventually, but its a steep learning curve to achieve the same functionality that Tablesorter gives me in terms of looks, filtering, sorting and pagination.p  pAt the risk of this being labeled as a nonconstructive question  any advicep

Negative 8279 pPretty much usual scenario. I want to have some decoupled piece of code, that is triggering event when something is ready. This will happen only once for the whole application run. p  pOn other side, there is another piece of code, where I want something else to happen when two or more events are triggered. I mean like all of them, like dependencies.p  pAlright, more async things together ... definitely promises right p  pThen I started thinking. Is it really wise to use pubsub for one time events  Wouldnt be better to just make accessible promise, that resolves once that event is about to be triggered  However that would mean I need to kinda interconnect that decoupled code. One thing is having shared EventEmitter, but being dependent on some code to actually create promise ... that sounds rather bad.p  pSo I am thinking about some kind of mix. Having module, where other modules can ask for event by its name and obtaining prepared Promise object. Other module should then trigger that event and effectively fulfillingrejecting that event this way.p  precodevar promisedLand  require.promisedLand promisedLand.waitForevent  returns promise promisedLand.resolveevent, value promisedLand.rejectevent, error codepre  pWhat do you think about this solution  Any chance there is some solution like this already available p

Negative 8279 pI am seeing an odd problem when using an embedded Scala interpreter. It manifests itself as a corruption  of the hosting noninterpreter class loader. It roughly goes like thisp  ul liI have a class codeFoocode in the hosting environmentli liI am matching against codeFoocode in some place codecase f Foo gt ...codeli liI am running the interpreter at some point codeIMain gt interpretcodeli liAfter that the pattern match for codeFoocode fails if I check the class it is codeFoocode but it does not match with codeFoocodeli ul  pSo I except that there are now two competing class loaders which produce two nonidentical instances of codeclass Foocode. There is emonly oneem codeFoocode in my entire class path, so there is no way that it could be shadowed. Also, it is sufficient to run something like code1  1code in the interpreter, so there is absolutely no way that the codeIMaincode itself tried to load class codeFoocode.p  pI know this is very vague, but I am hoping for hints as to trace the bug.p  hr  pstrongEditstrong After further investigation, this problem occurs only when building against Scala 2.11.0, but disappears when building against 2.10.4 I ensured that the builds were made from cleanstate.

Negative 8279 pI am having an issue with spring securitys timeout facility. On my home JSP i have a table. each list item will allow the user to modify the data in this list element. when you click the edit icon a modal opens with the data from that list element so the user can edit it. the issue I am having is if this modal is open and the system times out and loads the login page. but it loads the login page into the table div. I am just wondering if anyone knows of any possible solutions to this problem I have increased the time out limit but will not fix the problem of the login page being displayed in my table div. any help is much appreciated. p  phanks in advance Billyp

Negative 8279 pI am trying to find a heart rate from a video of my skin.

Negative 8279 pWhen I execute my tests one by one, all tests work and there are no problems. However when I execute them all together, I will run into problems like codeNullReferenceExceptioncode and codeSemaphoreFullExceptioncode.p  pAfter a lot of digging I have noticed that the threads of my tests seem to interfere with eachother even after the test has finished, duplicated background calls seem to continue when another test is being executed.p  pThe application in question is a WinRT Component executed from a Universal App Unit Test Project. All calls youll see below are executed asynchronously. In order to give my backgroundtasks the time to finish if the test continues while supposedly waiting for the asynchronous background task, it will shutdown once it reaches the end of the test I put the main thread to sleep for an appropriate amount of time with p  precodenew ManualResetEventfalse.WaitOnemillisecondsTimeout 60  1000 codepre  pAdditionally I have also added a sleep to the teardown method to be very sure everything gets finishedp  precode[TestCleanup] public void Cleanup     new ManualResetEventfalse.WaitOnemillisecondsTimeout 60  1000  codepre  pIn order to diagnose what I have so far, I have looked at the execution plan of the tests and since theyre pretty similar I simply put a codeDebug.WriteLinesession.GetHashCodecode in every relevant place where my code passes. Below you can find the result of that stripped from the codeFileNotFoundExceptionscode in mscorlib, endofthread messages and symbol loading messages.p  pThis codeSessioncode object in question is something that gets created by the user and passes it on to codeCorecode which then passes it on to codeMainApicode and codeStorageApicode. The former wraps this into a codeDispatchercode and passes this dispatcher onto codeUserControllercode while codeStorageApicode simply passes the session object to codeStorageControllercode and subsequently codeDatabaseControllercode.p  pThroughout the entire hierarchy the same session object is used and passed through and all objects use the reference that is available to them at their location.p  pThe semaphore comes into play when a database is created. In the codeEventBuscode there is a property p  precodeinternal static SemaphoreSlim TablesCreatedSemaphore  new SemaphoreSlim0, 1 codepre  pwhich is used to make sure that there will be no data requested before the tables are created.

The output I expect is a blurred pure white shape on a black background, but the white shape isnt white anymore, its grey. Now Ive gone over my code several times and I cannot find where the problem is.

Negative 8279 pI am doing a project where I compare different types of Text compression methods such as Huffman and Arithmetic for both static and adaptive form. I make a probability table for both using the number of occurrence of each letter in the text. Now, for adaptive form, the receiver does not need the Probability table but for the static form, we need to transmit this probability table as well to the receiver for decoding the message. Now this storing of the table will need some extra bits, which should be taken into account while comparing.p  pSo my question here isp  ol liWhat is the best solution for storing the probability table in a file.li liWhat is the minimum number of bits required to do that I know it depends on the text, but is there some way to find the minimum bits required to store the table.li ol  pThank you very much.p

What do I gain by using CRTP in this case Is there any point Should I ditch it and follow the other examples Ive foundli liIn the current framework, the assignment to the data member in the Vec class is handled by a copy constructor in the Vec class. This wont work if I want to use the expression template returned by Vechead, since the assignment happens within the class that holds the data, not the expression template.li liIve tried creating an assignment operator within the new expression template, but that wont work with the code above as all the expression template members are const references, and so the assignment operator is deleted at compile time. Can I just switch the members to being values instead of references Will this impact on performance if additional storage is needed Will this even work if I change a stored copy of the expression rather than the expression itselfli ol  pOverall Im confused about how to go about adding an expression template that can be used as an lvalue in the code above.

It seems to be an issue with the View. In the Advanced View settings, I have Hide Attachments in Summary set to No.p  pMight I need to adjust the view template to enable the display of attached files to anonymous users Or make a template for the specific attachment fieldp  pThanksp
Negative 8279 pI just have a very basic question, I am wondering what would be the best way to make a stack of cards where each are offset. In the code below I tried to use a StackPane, the problem is however that it doesnt seem to register the offset coordinates.p  pIn the image below you will see that I tried to deal 2 cards to the dealer and to player1 and yes those are two different stacks Note I havent taken the time to position them correctly yet, also the border around the table is temporary.

Negative 8279 pThe code I am writing is actually a WPF behaviour to get the selected items from a grid control SelectedItems, as we know, is not a bindable property. I am actually using a Telerik RadGridView but I would like the Behaviour to be general for anything with a SelectionChanged event. However, different controls have different signatures for the SelectionChanged event handlers RadGridView uses Telerik.Windows.Controls.SelectionChangeEventArgs whereas a standard GridView uses System.Windows.Controls.SelectionChangedEventArgs. The one thing we can be sure of is that the event args will be derived from EventArgs in fact we can be sure that it will be derived from RoutedEventArgs.p  pHowever, while I can write a general event handler that takes a RoutedEventArgs as its second parameter, and I can use reflection to get the EventInfo for the SelectionChangedEvent, I cant hook the handler to the event without using the precise signature for the event handler  in this case the RadGridView handler.p  pHere is my code. Ive included all of it but the important bit is SelectItemPropertyChanged, which is the DependencyObject PropertyChangedCallback that attempts to hook up the event handler SelectionChangedHandler to the SelectionChangedEvent. The code in SelectionChangedHandler is irrelevant to the question but Ive left it in so its clear what Im doing.p  precodepublic static class SelectedItemsChangedBehaviour public static readonly DependencyProperty SelectItemsProperty      DependencyProperty.RegisterAttachedSelectItems, typeofbool, typeofSelectedItemsChangedBehaviour,     new FrameworkPropertyMetadatafalse, new PropertyChangedCallbackSelectItemPropertyChanged  public static void SetSelectItemsDependencyObject dependencyObject, bool selectItems      dependencyObject.SetValueSelectItemsProperty, selectItems   public static bool GetSelectItemsDependencyObject dependencyObject      return booldependencyObject.GetValueSelectItemsProperty   private static void SelectItemPropertyChangedDependencyObject dependencyObject, DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs dependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs       No common base for all classes with SelectionChanged event so use reflection     EventInfo selectionChangedEventInfo  dependencyObject.GetType.GetEventSelectionChanged     if selectionChangedEventInfo  null              throw new ArgumentExceptionMust have a SelectionChanged event.           if booldependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs.OldValue               This is what I want to do, but it throws because the handler signature is wrong         selectionChangedEventInfo.RemoveEventHandlerdependencyObject, RoutedEventHandlerSelectionChangedHandler           This works fine because it is of the right type for the RadGridView but is not general         selectionChangedEventInfo.RemoveEventHandlerdependencyObject, EventHandlerltTelerik.Windows.Controls.SelectionChangeEventArgsgtSelectionChangedHandler          if booldependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs.NewValue               This is what I want to do, but it throws because the handler signature is wrong         selectionChangedEventInfo.AddEventHandlerdependencyObject, RoutedEventHandlerSelectionChangedHandler           This works fine because it is of the right type for the RadGridView but is not general         selectionChangedEventInfo.AddEventHandlerdependencyObject, EventHandlerltTelerik.Windows.Controls.SelectionChangeEventArgsgtSelectionChangedHandler        private static void SelectionChangedHandlerobject sender, RoutedEventArgs eventArgs       No common base for all classes with AddedItemsRemovedItems eg.

Negative 8279 pWe have a webapp using standard JSPservlets and packaged as a codewarcode file. This makes the app really portable. We can push it to any cloud supporting Java such as AWS beanstalk.

Negative 8279 pI am a frontend developer who knows little JSP. I am working on a project that is building a CMS. This particular part I need advice is for slideshow data. In the JSP I am loading each slide and then injecting data with ajax. However it seems to be loading slowly, especially slideshows with more than 100 slides. It is also breaking with a lot of slidesHTML structure seems to break. p  pEach slides data is loading with its own endpoint by taking its ID. In addition, each slide has a edit button that calls the slides endpoint again to load a form, which also seems to load a bit slow. I was seeking what the best way to go about including this data with ajax. I was thinking something like infinite scroll  specifically a hrefhttpwww.responsivewebmobile.comappwebrootrwminfinitescroll relnofollowhttpwww.responsivewebmobile.comappwebrootrwminfinitescrolla. However, what is the best way of organizing this and loading the data Any advice is greatly appreciated.p

Negative 8279 pWhen you free memory, what happens to pointers that point into that memory  Do they become invalid immediately  What happens if they later become valid againp  pCertainly, the usual case of a pointer going invalid then becoming valid again would be some other object getting allocated into what happens to be the memory that was used before, and if you use the pointer to access memory, thats emobviouslyem undefined behavior.  Dangling pointer memory overwrite lesson 1, pretty much.p  pBut what if the memory becomes valid again for the same allocation  Theres only one Standard way for that to happen coderealloccode.  If you have a pointer to somewhere within a codemalloccoded memory block at offset codegt 1code, then use coderealloccode to shrink the block to less than your offset, your pointer becomes invalid, obviously.  If you then use coderealloccode again grow the block back to at least cover the object type pointed to by the dangling pointer, and in neither case did coderealloccode move the memory block, is the dangling pointer valid againp  pThis is such a corner case that I dont really know how to interpret the C or C standards to figure it out.

Negative 8279 pPlease, bear with me. Im sorry for the long post.p  pI have a 3D scene on my iPad with a cube, a sphere, and cylinder. I wanted to apply texture to the cube, color to the sphere, and both texture and color to the cylinder. p  pSo, my solution was to have 3 different shader programs to handle those 3 cases, then during rendering, I used glUseProgram to switch to the appropriate shader program prior to rendering my cubespherecylinder. p  pHowever, the problem was that the glUseProgram doesnt seem to work during rendering.p  pIn the renderScene function below, if I use the same shader handle for all 3 objects, then all 3 objects will render as expected, no problem. However, the moment I mixed them up, only objects that use the same shader handle as the last object will be rendered.p  pFor examplep  precodedrawcube,     mprogramHandleTexture  showing drawsphere,   mprogramHandleColor    not showing drawcylinder, mprogramHandleTexture  showing  NOTE last object rendered codepre  pAnother examplep  precodedrawcube,     mprogramHandleTexture  not showing drawsphere,   mprogramHandleColor    showing drawcylinder, mprogramHandleColor    showing  NOTE last object rendered codepre  pSo, I think I must be missing something really simple before calling glUseProgram to switch the shader programs.

The 50 stars on the flag represent the 50 states of the United States of America and the 13 stripes represent the thirteen British colonies that declared independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain and became the first states in the Union.[1] Nicknames for the flag include the Stars and Stripes, Old Glory,[2] and The StarSpangled Banner.ltfigcaptiongt       ltfiguregt       ltp classs1gt The United States of America USA or U.S.A., commonly referred to as the United States US or U.S., America, and sometimes the States, is a federal republic[17][18] consisting of 50 states and a federal district. The 48 contiguous states and Washington, D.C., are in central North America between Canada and Mexico. The state of Alaska is the northwestern part of North America and the state of Hawaii is an archipelago in the midPacific. The country also has five populated and nine unpopulated territories in the Pacific and the Caribbean. At 3.80 million square miles 9.85 million km2[4] and with around 318 million people, the United States is the worlds third or fourthlargest country by total area and thirdlargest by population. It is one of the worlds most ethnically diverse and multicultural nations, the product of largescale immigration from many countries.[19] The geography and climate of the United States is also extremely diverse, and it is home to a wide variety of wildlife. ltpgt       ltp classs1gt PaleoIndians migrated from Eurasia to what is now the U.S. mainland around 15,000 years ago,[20] with European colonization beginning in the 16th century. The United States emerged from 13 British colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard. Disputes between Great Britain and these colonies led to the American Revolution. On July 4, 1776, as the colonies were fighting Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, delegates from the 13 colonies unanimously issued the Declaration of Independence. The war ended in 1783 with the recognition of independence of the United States from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and was the first successful war of independence against a European colonial empire.[21][22] The current Constitution was adopted on September 17, 1787. The first ten amendments, collectively named the Bill of Rights, were ratified in 1791 and designed to guarantee many fundamental civil rights and freedoms. ltpgt     ltsectiongt   ltarticlegt    ltSidebargt   ltasidegt ltasidegt ltdivgt ltbodygtlthtmlgt codepre

Negative 8279 pIm writing a GUI package on Python with Tkinter module and using matplotlib via emFigureCanvasTkAggem to show some graphical data.

Everything works just fine, but I do not satisfied with default arrowlike cursor it does not allow precise clicking on my data the actual click point does not match with the tip of the arrow and also it hides from user some area near the click pint. So the question is how to change the default cursor I tried change it through Tk config methods like emmaster.configcursortcrossem, but apparently matplotlib canvas has its own cursor configuration because this string only changes appearance of the cursor above all parts of main window except MPL canvas, above canvas the default arrow is still being shown.p

Negative 8279 pI want to test my Jersey resources in a Dropwizard 0.8.0rc2 application. An additional obstacle is that I use TestNG instead of JUnit, so I have to do some things by hand that I copied from codeDropwizardClientRulecode.p  pNow I have some resources that are secured by codeAuthcode. In Dropwizard 0.7.1 I added the authenticator to the test application as followsp  precodeDropwizardResourceConfig resourceConfig  DropwizardResourceConfig.forTesting         AuthenticatorltBasicCredentials, Identitygt authenticator          credentials gt getAuthorizedIdentity resourceConfig.getSingletons.add         new BasicAuthProviderltgtauthenticator, TEST codepre  pHere, codegetAuthorizedIdentitycode would fetch some test authorization. This would be passed to the codeAuthcode annotated injected parameter. Now, of course, with Jersey 2 things have changed a bit. I triedp  precodeDropwizardResourceConfig resourceConfig  DropwizardResourceConfig.forTesting AuthenticatorltBasicCredentials, Identitygt authenticator          credentials gt getAuthorizedIdentity resourceConfig.registerAuthFactory.binder         new BasicAuthFactoryltgtauthenticator, TEST, Identity.class codepre  pThe effect is that I get 401 on all secured resources. Debugging shows that my authenticate function is never called at all If I remove the registration, then I will not get 401s anymore so the registration is not without effect, but now the secured resources are unsecured and get codenullcode for the codeAuthcode annotated parameter.p  pSo, how do I add the authenticator to the test context so it will work The production code works fine with almost the same line.p
Negative 8279 pBesides stronge references, there are three distinct kinds of Reference WeakReference, SoftReference and PhantomReference. There may be others, but they will either extend one those or be irrelevant to my question.p  pIf an object is not strongly reachable during a GC cycle, it gets garbage collected i.e. finalized and removed from memory. But before it is collected, any Reference is cleared  depending on reachability conditions, the kind of Reference to be cleared, memory demand, etc.p  pI was wondering, if the JLS made any guarantees about whether all References of the same kind to the same object are cleared atomicallysimultaneously, or if there is a slight chance ie. race condition, that some References get cleared while other References of the same kind are not, such that an object could potentially be revived ie. be strongly referenced again through one of the remaining References although some References of the same kind have already been cleared and enqueued.p  pQuestion rephrased from a different POV Is it safe to assume that a cleared Reference implies that the previously referenced object cannot be revived through a different Reference of the same kindp

Negative 8279 pPlease indicate if this is the wrong forum for this, but I am looking for a very rough scope estimate for adding a bulk upload feature. Our site is in PHP and the functionality for the bulk upload is basically we want to allow users to enter text into CSV files that will populate posts with that text. We will also allow users to enter image file names into the CSV and upload a folder with the images and their file names so that the posts contain the images as well. p  pThe site itself already supports the posts and their respective fields through a web form so this simply allows a bulk feature on top of alreadybuilt functionality. p  pIm trying to see if something like this would be on the order of days, weeks or months to build.

Negative 8279 pstrongImportant Information and Approachstrongp  pSo I have this method that is incomplete at the moment whose sole purpose is to change the background image in every screen. Here is the method that does this.p  precodeifoptionButton1.isArmed      optionButton1.setOnMouseClickedegt Optionmenu.setIdBlueBackground1  else ifoptionButton2.isArmed      optionButton2.setOnMouseClickedegt Optionmenu.setIdBlueBackground2  else      optionButton3.setOnMouseClickedegt Optionmenu.setIdBlueBackground3  codepre  pSo what this code does at the moment is check to see what button has been pressed and released and changes the old id to a new id. Once it changes it to a new id, it will change the id in the FXML File and then the FXML file will go into my css file and look for the id that matches the new id. p  pNow this FXML variable is in one of my controller classstrongOptionscreenControllerstrong and the variables name is Optionmenu. It look likes this in my controller class p  precodeFXML private StackPane Optionmenu codepre  pthis mean that optionmenu is the main root of the FXML File that this method changes.p  pOne of my challenges are to find a way to bring all the nodes or roots to this class and change the ids of those nodes as well if possible.p  pstrongHere was my attempt at solving this problemstrongp  precode   try              FXMLLoader myLoader  new FXMLLoadergetClass.getResourceMillionaireTriviaGame.MAIN         myLoader.load         mainMenu  myLoader.getRoot         mainMenu.setIdBlueBackground2          catch IOException ex              Logger.getLoggerOptionscreenController.class.getName.logLevel.SEVERE, null, ex       codepre  pWhat i was thinking of doing was loading up a FXML file with another FXML file beside the main one, stronguse getRoot to get the objectstrong inside the FXML File, add it to a variable that has the same strongfxidstrong and use the strongsetIdstrong to change its old id.p  pNow there are two problems with this first and foremost, doing it this way will invoke the override method initialized to run no matter whatevery controller has to have this method. So I said, ok so I wont use FXMLLoader.load. Ill just go straight to getRoot immediately. Turns out it sets the FXML variable to null.p  pThe last challenge I have is keeping the changes made to each background as the user transition from screen to screen.p  pThese are the challenges that Im facing at the moment.p  hr  pstrongCode Timestrongp  pThe first thing that I think you need to see is how I transition from screen to screen.

Negative 8279 pNoob here with regards to Oracle and OCI.p  pI am writing a program to do some tasks for my company.  Amongst the tasks, I have to update an oracle database to keep it in synch with other actions.  p  pI want to preallocate memory efficiently to hold the results of fetching on the select set.  In order to do that, I need to know how many rows are in the select set.  p  pI could do it with 2 separate statements first a SELECT COUNT statement, followed by a SELECT statement, but that is inefficient from a server point of view. I could also just execute my SELECT statement and dynamically allocate memory as rows are fetched from the select set, but that is inefficient from a client point of view.p  pI want to simply execute the SELECT statement and, before fetching any rows, retrieve the number of matching rows in the select set.  p  pBut I cannot locate an attribute that has this information.br There is OCIATTRROWCOUNT but this is the number of rows FETCHED, not the total number of rows in the select set. Then there is OCIATTRPARAMCOUNT which tells you the number of COLUMNS seems useless because you already know how many columns you asked for in your SQL.p  pDoes anybody know how to obtain the select set row count prior to fetchingp  pThanks Joshp

Negative 8279 pI was looking at a programming question today and I had an issues finding the theta runtime of it. Basically, within my question, I form the following loop structurep  precodeforint i  0 i lt n i     forint j  i  1 j lt n j         forint k  j  1 k lt n k             check some condition codepre  pBy obvious inspection, it is On3. More accurately, it is on3. However, I want to know what the theta runtime of this is. If you examine this loop, the actual amount of times the inner condition executes is n3n3 since it is evaluating all combinations of n numbers without repetition.p  pIs there a way to express the theta runtime in polynomial form other than n choose rp  pFor example, the runtime of selection sort similar but with only 2 for loops can be evaluated by looking at the number of instructions being executed. n  n1  n2 ...  1 would simplify to nn1  2.p

Negative 8279 pI am creating an Angular application, and I am having trouble wrapping my head around the proper way to ensure my application and its users is secure.p  pIve been reading around many stack discussions, but I believe I am missing some core understanding of what is happening, please correct any errors you see written below.p  pSo far I have a Sinatra server with many currently mostly hypothetical resource routes.  A user can create an account using an email address and password that is stored in a database after being hashed with BCrypt.  When a user logs in, the record is retrieved from the database by email and the password checked for authentication.  It is from this point I am not sure how to proceed.p  pPrior to this I have simply set a session variable and had the server check that the variable exists in order to correctly route logged in users.  Now my application is currently a single HTML page that uses Angular and uirouter to display different content, so most of the requests are simply returning JSON content.p  pIt is my understanding that Restful applications should generally not use sessions, or rather that the server should respond identically to identical requests and not have its own data that shapes a response. strongBut if I do not store something in a session variable, how could the server know that the client making the request has the correct permissionsstrong And are sessions not stored in the browser anyway, thus not part of the serverp  pI believe from what I have read, it is possible to create a token which is essentially a large random string, return that string to the client and also store it in a database with a timestamp. The client then provides this token when making requests and the server hits the database to verify it exists and valid. But would the client not also have to store that string in a cookie  I suppose the angular application could store the token in a variable, which would persist while using the uirouter but not if the users navigates using the address bar.p  pI also do not understand how Basic Auth may or may not fit into this picture. Any help would be greatly appreciated, as well as a pointer to some good resources where I may find a better understanding of these concepts in general.p

Negative 8279 pstrongBackground infostrong I have a simple tally counterhabittracking app that populates a tableview with custom cells  the counters. Tapping on a cell brings up a detailed view of a specific counter that has the name, value, and the time period for that counter dailyweeklymonthlyyearlytotal. I have also stored in CoreData the startDate and endDate for each counter, so each counter resets after a certain time.p  pstrongWhat I would like to dostrong Each time a counter resets e.g. after a day or a week, I would like its current total value to be added to a log preferably some sort of array specific to that counter. This will then populate another tableview so that, after a few weeks, I can look back and see the previous weekly totals and compare it to the current week.p  pstrongMy data structurestrongp  pEntity Counterp  pAttributes Value Int, startDateNSDate, endDateNSDate, timePeriodInt Note For timePeriod, each integer from 0 to 4 represents dailyweeklymonthlyyearlyno reset.p  pstrongMy question How can I implement this Do I create another entity with a date and value attribute that is created each time a counter resets Im having trouble visualizing how to do this with CoreData.strongp  pP.S.

Negative 8279 pI have a data set, coderfmcode, which has a column named codecohortcode, of class codeDatecode as shown below.

Somehow codeas.POSIXctcode wont reveal the time zone to codeintervalcode, even if its explicitly set in the same call. What am I missingp

Why is this so Why is the function which stays within Integer arithmetic slower, whereas the function which goes into string comparison is fasterp  pI ask this because I come from programming in Java and similar languages, where the code 10code trick of generating digits is way faster than the convert to String method. I havent been able to wrap my head around the fact that converting to a string could be faster.p

Most importantly, please tell me what file the code should go into and where its located. In the vast majority of answers Ive found here I just see chunks of code pasted and I usually have no clue where its supposed to go.p  pSo heres what I would like to accomplish I have created a custom post type Dealer that is being displayed as a list of search results. By default, each Dealer title is a link directing to the single post page. I do not want the titles to be links, since the single pages are irrelevant and shouldnt be accessed. I did find threads in the forum describing how to remove the anchor tags from all posts globally but I have not found any describing how to do it just for a specific custom post type but if one exists, feel free to just link me to that.p

Negative 8279 pI have been reading over the threads here, and cant seem to find what I am looking for. I will start this off by saying I am a new  using Python, but taking a few classes.  The goal is to be able to SSH into a Router, run a command script below does this Next is to be able to grep or extract info from the command, and store this as a variable.  The example would be to track down a route, the router will display a prefix, and the next hop. I would like the script to be able to store the next hop in a variable, and then exit out of the router, and SSH into the variable stored. p  pThe basic question is how would I go about writing this into a python scriptp  pBelow is the code I have that works so farp  precodeimport paramiko import time   def disablepagingremoteconn      Disable Screen Length 24   remoteconn.sendenvironment no moren  time.sleep1 ip  192.168.0.1 name  ROUTER1 PUT ROUTER NAME HERE IF YOU WANT username  LOGMEIN  PUT YOUR USERNAME HERE password  PASSWORD  PUT YOUR PASSWORD HERE  remoteconnpre  paramiko.SSHClient remoteconnpre  remoteconnpre.setmissinghostkeypolicy paramiko.AutoAddPolicy  remoteconnpre.connectip, username  username, password  password, lookforkeys  False, allowagent  False  print SSH connection established to s  name   remoteconn  remoteconnpre.invokeshell print SSH session established to s, s  ip, name  Strip the initial router prompt output  remoteconn.recv1000 print output    DEFINE COMMANDS HERE remoteconn.sendenvironment no moren  removes the break after 24 lines,      no needed to press a key remoteconn.sendshow router routetable 0.0.0.0n       Wait for the command to complete time.sleep2       this is the buffer for  of lines to receive 5000 output  remoteconn.recv5000 print output codepre

Negative 8279 pI setup a websocket using Socket.io and express 4 framework on node.js server.p  pI am trying to implement authorization step for my users when using my websocket.p  pWhen a user connects, a token is passed as a query value to the server.

If a session is found, I do few other check to ensure that the token is not hijacked.p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pThe session data seems to be cleared on every page reload.

Negative 8279 pI have an application written in C which write to an ofstream file output stream. The problem is, that the CApplication is writing about 2000 Lines before flushing the stream emltlt endlem and the output became visible inside the file which i monitor via emtail fem. But for debugging purpose i want to see the emunflushed contentem of the stream.p  pAdding emltlt endlem inside the CApplication sounds logic, but isnt possible at all because there are too many places where i have to add emltlt endlem and it is going to look really ugly because i have to addp  precodeifdef DEBUG fileStream ltlt endl endif codepre  peverywhere in the code.p  pSo im looking for a way to read the stream from another application.
