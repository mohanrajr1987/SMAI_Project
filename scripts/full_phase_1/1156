Negative 1156 pSo the idea is to sort a large STRUCTURE using an element of that structure, for arguments sake Zip Code.p  pTo keep it simple lets pretend that there are two arrays, one integer containing the zip codes and two, a larger structure 3k Bytes array. p  pSorting the integer array is suitably fast with Quick Sort, but tagging the Structure array could be done a little better than simply swapping elements when the integer array swaps elements.p  pIn testing a random 3000 element integer array required 12000 swaps to achieve a completed sort. Swapping the entire structure that many times would have a performance penalty esp if there are many elements.p  pIdeally I would just sort an array of pointers, but in this case I actually have to return a sorted structure array not an array of sorted pointers. If nothing else this is an exercise in sorting a tagged array.p  pOne approach would be to tag a secondary integer array, and then use the order within it to shuffle the elements of the structure around, thus moving each element only once.p  pI am not finding much help on the web a hrefhttprosettacode.orgwikiSortinganArrayofIntegersC relnofollowhttprosettacode.orgwikiSortinganArrayofIntegersCap  pSuggestions for an elegant design would be appreciated.p

Negative 1156 pI have two lists, one with an ID of vlist and one with an ID of hlist. The vlist holds elements which should be visible, while the hlist holds items that should remain hidden. The idea here is to allow the administrator of the system to specify which elementsfields should be shown on a signup page, and which shouldnt. The two lists are connected using connectWith, so the administrator can drag items from the visible list to the hidden list or vice versa.p  pMy dilemma is that there are a few fields I want emlockedem into the visible list, but still sortable within that one list. For example, the username, email and password fields should be locked within the visible list as they always need to be used for registration.p  pIs this even possible Perhaps it is a nobrainer that I simply havent discovered yet. Ive looked around through jQuerys documentation for a while and cant seem to find anything related to this scenario. I have found how you can cancel specific elements in the list from being sortable altogether or even disabled from being a dropable target, but this doesnt do it. The user should still have the ability to drag these items within the visible list, in case they want to adjust the ordering of the locked fields. Im also aware that you can contain sortable elements within a specific element or DOM object, but this also cant be used as this only seems to apply to the whole sortable list, and not specific elements of that list.p  pIve even tried to see if something like this would work after I built the sortable listingsp  precodevlist gt slistliusername.sortableoption, containment, vlist codepre  pObviously, that didnt work either or I wouldnt be posting this.p  pIn case it might help, I thought Id throw in the code Im using now here is the jQuery codep  precodefunction  vlist, hlist.sortable          connectWith .signupsetflist,     forcePlaceholderSize true,     receive function event, ui                  var itemID  ui.item.attrid         var fID  itemID.replaceslistlig,          var hID  slist  fID         if ui.sender.attrid  vlist                          hID.val                      else                          hID.valfID                           .disableSelection     vlist gt slistliusername.sortableoption, containment, vlist  codepre  pAnd as for the HTML, Ill upload it to here since StackOverflow seems to break when I paste it in here  even in code modep  pa hrefhttpsikosoft.netjquerysortconnect.html relnofollowhttpsikosoft.netjquerysortconnect.htmlap

Negative 1156 pIm designing a new system, and I have need to store a pretty large volume of different type of data, with realitivly few rows per type.p  pI know that if I were doing this with SQL Server I dont want to use a SQL Azure database for this.

In addition, it would be nice to use a factory to create these codeFoocodes off of a factory method.p  pIve fumbled with a few quick implementations of commonality in base class or interface and nothing I came up with answered this, seemingly, very simple problem elegantly.p  pstrongSmall editstrong I shouldve mentioned that my primary goal is to use the .Value without forcing a cast on the caller.p
Negative 1156 pI am trying to decouple two applications using EDA and NServiceBus.  Currently, I have a Sales MT and an Inventory MT.  Whenever a sale is requested through the Sales MT, before it is approved the Sales MT will call the Inventory MT to make sure there is available stock.  I want to change the way this works, so that the Sales MT just automatically approves it, and publishes an async SaleCreated event, which the Inventory MT and the Billing MT will then subscribe to.  The Inventory MT can then flag the Sale in an offline process if there are any outofstock items.p  pMy problem is that I have 10 instances of my Sales MT, 5 instances of my Inventory MT, and 3 instances of my Billing MT.  All 3 applications have their own Virtual IP on top of a LoadBalancer that sits in front of the 1053 servers.  So basically I have 1 virtual publication SaleCreated events and 2 virtual subscriptions Inventory and Billing subscribers.  Ideally, a Sale that gets processed by the Sales MT, should create a SaleCreated event message to be sent to 1 and only 1 Inventory MT, and 1 and only one Billing MT.  I am really confused how this will work, since I havent seen examples of this scenario on the NServiceBus site.  Also, I dont want to have all messages sent to a single distributor for each subscription, as that will cause one machine to be a bottleneck.p  pIs there any way to do thisp

Stallone is known for his machismo  and Hollywood action roles. Stallones film Rocky was inducted into the National Film Registry as well as having its film props placed in the Smithsonian Museum. Stallones use of the front entrance to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the Rocky series led the area to be nicknamed the Rocky Steps.A commercial, educational, and cultural center, Philadelphia was once the secondlargest city in the British Empire  after London, and the social and geographical center of the original 13 American colonies. It was a centerpiece of early American history, host to many of the ideas and actions that gave birth to the American Revolution and independence.The American Revolution was the political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century in which thirteen colonies in North America joined together to break free from the British Empire, combining to become the United States of America. They first rejected the authority of the Parliament of Great Britain to govern them from overseas without representation, and then expelled all royal officials. By 1774 each colony had established a Provincial Congress, or an equivalent governmental institution, to form individual selfgoverning states.p blockquote

Negative 1156 pI have a multithreaded Delphi 6 Pro application that I am currently working on heavily.  If I set a breakpoint on any code that runs in the context of the Main thread VCL thread I dont have any problems.  However, if a breakpoint is triggered on any code in one of my other threads, after I continue the application from the breakpoint, all repaints to the VCL components on the main thread including the main form dont happen anymore.  The application isnt dead because other background code keeps running, just the main thread.  Its as if the windows message dispatcher has been corrupted or rendered dormant.p  pNote, in this application I allocate my own WndProc via allocateHwnd on the main form because I need to catch certain registered messages.  From that WndProc I dispatch any custom messages I handle and if the current message is not handled by my code, I pass the message on by calling the main forms inherited WndProc.  If I do handle the current message I simply return from my WndProc with Msg.Result set to 1 to tell the dispatcher that the message was handled.  I cant simply override the TForm WndProc instead of allocating my own WndProc because for some reason the Delphi VCL does not pass through registered messages instantiated with the Windows API RegisterWindowMessage call.p  pHas anybody experienced this in similar context and if so, what did you do to fix itp  p roscherlp

Negative 1156 pThere have been various posts of logging the activity start, commit amp rollback of Springs transaction manager. However, I recently came across a deadlock issue for which logging just the activity isnt enough. p  pThe fundamental issue in our code is a messy usage of transaction propagations REQUIRED and REQUIRESNEW. There are so many method calls back and forth that we end up with a lot of transactions stacked onto each other. Alas, the code base is huge and the solution urgent... We all know what this is.p  pThe issue was a deadlock because code was added to query entities in a transaction that were subsequentially modified in another transaction. Spring spits out an exception telling the update of entity X times out because its locked. Now, Knowing this is nice, but how does one find the faulty code The query which does the early locking.p  pMy question at last  Is there a way to log the entities being added to a transaction  This way I can specifically look for transactions locking the entity Spring is complaining about.p  pThanks  p

Negative 1156 pBackground I have an image intensive app that was originally made for iPhone and upgraded to iPad using two devicespecific applications. So now, all of my resources are common to both, except the interfaces which are unique to each iPad and iPhone. p  pProblem My problem is now I have a set of images that I want to display at the full screen width of each device, and animate in some cases. For the iPhone, Ive created a copy of all images that have been downsized to 320x320 for memory and performance. For the iPad, I have the original image sizes bc of image quality.p  pQuestion I want to know if theres a way to copy in the higher quality image folder into the iPad Resources section and leave the lower quality image folder in the iPhone Resources section. The folders with images are named Set 1 thru Set 20 and are accessed from the code as such. Is there any way to keep both a higher quality image set and lower quality image set within the same project and keep the folder names the same for both Any help is MUCH appreciatedp
Negative 1156 pMy question in a nutshell is Is there a correlation between the number of decimals used in GPS coordinates and the accuracy of the locationp  pRight now I happen to be working with the Android SDK but Im sure this question can apply to many other geolocation SDKs.

Negative 1156 pIs there a best practice or widely accepted way of structuring and validating data using MVVM in conjunction with RIA services in Silverlightp  pHeres the crux of my problem. Lets say I have an EmployeeView, EmployeeViewModel and some Employee entity. In regular RIA applications I will expose that Employee entity on the view and I get validation for free, because Entities implement INotifyDataErrorInfo and IDataErrorInfo correct.p  pNow if I want to expose some Employee properties through a ViewModel instead of directly through an Entity then it becomes more complicated. I could expose the bits that I need directly and hook them into the entity on the backend, like thisp  precode    private Employee employee      public EmployeeViewModel              employee  new Employee           public string Name              get  return employee.Name          set                      employee.Name  value              fire property change, etc.               codepre  p... but I lose the tasty free validation of entities. Otherwise, I could expose the entity directly in the view model, like sop  precode    private Employee employee     public Employee Employee              get  return employee            public EmployeeViewModel              employee  new Employee      codepre  pIn this case, the view will bind directly to the Employee entity and find its properties in there, like sop  precodeltStackPanel DataContextBinding Employeegt     ltTextBox TextBinding Name gt ltStackPanelgt codepre  pUsing this method we get free validation, but its not exactly a clean implementation of MVVM.p  pA third option would be to implement INotifyDataErrorInfo and IDataErrorInfo myself in the VMs, but this seems like an awful lot of plumbing code, considering how easy it would be for me to use the above solution and have something slightly less clean but a heck of a lot easier at the end of the day.p  pSo I guess my question is, which of these approaches are appropriate in which situation Is there a better approach I am missingp  pIn case its relevant Im looking at the Caliburn.Micro MVVM framework, but I would be keen to see answers that apply generically.p

Negative 1156 pI have a WCF service and 2 clients Im testing with. The first client is written in c .NET 3.5 and has no trouble connecting to the WCF service. The other client is written in Delphi7, and its the one Im interested in getting working. This is the interesting part. If I start the service then hit it with the Delphi client, it wont connect... but if I start the service then hit it with the .Net client then try the Delphi client, it works  Could be something to do with the designtime addresses, Im not sure. Maybe a more experienced person will know whats going on and what I need to do to get my Delphi client working without needing a .Net client running alongside it. It might be relevant to note that the service is currently being hosted in a winforms app.p

Negative 1156 pCurrently, we have two kinds of portlets related to search. The first is for running searches, lets call it SearchPortlet, and the second is for formatting and displaying results, lets call it ResultPortlet. p  pAs time has gone on, the code for these portlets has undergone a series of mutations in order to fulfill customer requirements. And we have reached the point where any change to either portlet results in dozens of bug reports being opened. In order to share the results of a search, the Portlets use variables set on the a hrefhttpwww.bluesunrise.comportletapijavaxportletPortletSession.html relnofollowPortletSessiona object. This has resulted in all sorts of conditional statements littered all over the place in an attempt to manage the Objects in the Session, and make sure they are removed, read, or replaced at the appropriate moment. p  pWhen rewriting these portlets, I do not wish to make the same mistake as the original developer. However, at the same time, I have to admit, I am a bit wary of Portlets, and have not written any that share data in any way. There appear to be a hrefhttpportlets.blogspot.com200904interportletcommunicationinjsr286.html relnofollowtwo waysa to do a hrefhttpblog.xebia.com20090419interportletcoordinationwithjsr286 relnofollowinterportleta communication.p  ol liPublic render parametersli liPortlet eventsli ol  pAs the thing I am sharing between instances of SearchPortlet and ResultPortlet is a SearchResult object, Im guessing that Portlet events are my best bet, given that render parameters are just String objects.p  pIn terms of requirements  when a user runs a search in a SearchPortlet, the SearchResults must be available to ResultPortlet instances, which may be on the same page, or on other parts of the site. In addition, a large number of users may be running searches concurrently, and there should be no sharing of SearchResults embetweenem users. p  pA user can also further filter a search by clicking on a filter by.. link on the results page, but I dont want the ResultsPortlet to have anything to do with running searches. When a user clicks on a link to run another search, the ResultsPortlet is the target of the action I think, so maybe I need to generate an event to send to a SearchPortlet, which can then run the search before in turn generating a further set of results.. but which SearchPortlet would the event be sent to Perhaps I ought to do away with the idea of separate Search and Result portlets altogether Im not sure as yet. p  pSo finally, my questions are these is my thinking sound on this so far Have I missed anything Are there any gotchas that you think I need to be aware of Have you done anything similar in the past, and if so, how did it gop  pThanks in advance for any feedback. p  pEDIT Another relevant a hrefhttpdevelopers.sun.comportalserverreferencetechartjsr286jsr286.html relnofollowlinka.p
Negative 1156 pI have a ListView GridView that I want to sort by 2 columns, so if 2 items have the same value in Column 1, it sorts by Column 2. Pretty easy. But empty strings show up at the top when sorting AZ. Id like to move them to the bottom. I made a comparer IComparer that takes care of this, but Im not sure how to use it.p  pHeres the code I triedp  precode Dim view As ListCollectionView  CollectionViewSource.GetDefaultViewmyCollection  Using view.DeferRefresh     view.SortDescriptions.Clear     view.SortDescriptions.AddNew SortDescriptionsortHeader.Header, direction     view.SortDescriptions.AddNew SortDescriptionotherColumn, direction     view.CustomSort  New MyComparer  End Using codepre  pThe problem is my comparer is given a type of my class instead of the value of the propertycolumn being sorted by. So if the class is Foo and Im sorting by Foo.Bar, I get the entire Foo class, not just the value of Bar which is really all it should be concerned about, since thats what its sorting by.p  pHow will my comparer know which property to compare Maybe Im doing something wrong here, because this doesnt make any sense. I expected to get a String the property type for x and y...p  pDoes anyone know how to do thisp

Negative 1156 pIn my previous a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5719312uiviewblocktransitionsonshowinghidingkeyboardquestion on UIView animationsa I mentioned that I have to simulate the modal behavior for some view. Here Ill explain why and ask about some better solution.p  pThe first view a user should see in my app is the login screen. Upon successful authentication the program checks if the user is a parent or a child in a family. For each of these roles the app must provide different functionality.p  pSo I designed the app like thisp  ul liDeclare outlets for the login view controller and a tab bar controller for the main part of the interface in my AppDelegate.li liIn the codeapplicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptionscode method ul liSet the coderootViewControllercode of the main window to the login view controller.li liMake AppDelegate the delegate for the login controller, so it can send notification when its done its job.li ulli liWhen AppDelegate receives the message on successful login, it determines whether the user is a parent or a child, instantiates the set of view controllers that provide corresponding functionality and passes them to the tab bar controller.li liAt last AppDelegate switches the coderootViewControllercode of the main window to the tab bar controller.li liCertainly the user can logout, then the coderootViewControllercode is switched back again to the login controller.li ul  pI would like to present and dismiss the login screen as if it is a modal view, but AppDelegate only has a bare window, thus I dont have an object to send codepresentModalViewControllercode to. This brings up a questionp  pemFirst of all, is it a good designbr And if it is, how do I simulate a modal behavior correctlyemp

Negative 1156 pI am considering building a series of event driven neural networks, inspired by actual brain architecture rather than a simple feedforward networkFor a frame of reference, it will be closer to an HTM algorithm.

I am fairly new to event driven programming Ive toyed with wxPython so there are two questions I need to askp  pIs there a good event driven API intended for simulations, or should I just extract the features I need from something like openglp  pDo you have any suggestions as to how to limit the number of events that can occur in a given time period without skipping over events The simulation is a chain reaction and, if not properly handled, would consume all of the processor.p

Negative 1156 pIf I want to clone a polymorphic object in C i.e. an instance of a class A which is derived from some other class B, the easiest way seems to give B a virtual clone member function, that has to be overridden by A and looks like thisp  precodeA clone     return new Athis  codepre  pMy problem is, that I find this unnecessary boilerplate code, as this is almost always needed, if one wants to use runtime polymorphic features of C. How can it be circumventedp  pThanksp  pstrongWhy I need thisstrongp  pMy use case can be abstracted to the following example I have a codeclass Integralcode, which evaluates the integral of some function. Do do this, they have a member which is a pointer to the codeclass MathFunctioncode. This abstract class contains a pure virtual function codeevaluatecode which takes one argument. I I wanted to implement the power function I would create a codeclass PowFunction  class MathFunctioncode. This class would have a member codeexponentcode and the function evaluate would look like thisp  precodedouble evaluatex     return powx,exponent  codepre  pAs stated the member codeMathFunctioncode of codeclass Integralcode has to be polymorhpic, which requires it to be a pointer. To answer the questions of the commenters with another question. Why wouldnt I want to be able to make copies of MathFunction objects p  pI really want the Integral to own its MathFunction, meaning, that it can alter the parameters like codeexponentcode without changing the MathFunction of any other Integral object. This means every Integral needs to have its own copy. This requires a clone function for MathFunctions, doesnt itp  pOne alternative i thought of If several Integral objects can share the same MathFunction via a pointer to the same address, I could create copies of Integral objects without the need to copy the MathFunction. But in this case I would have to make all the properties const or somehow readonly, which is not very elegant either. Also, which Integral object should handle delete the MathFunction objectp  pstrongWhy you need thisstrongp  pAre you seriously saying, that as soon as you work with polymorphic objects you dont ever need a copy operation What makes polymorphic object different from other objects in this respectp  pUsing this argumentation, you could also throw the copy constructor and copy assignment operator out of the C standardp

Negative 1156 pI have a weird problem, I have got CORS working without cookies, and am now adding cookie support as my webservice uses cookies as part of its authentication mechanism for certain routes.p  pNow originally when I set the xhr.withCredentials  true it would receive and accept the cookie, but then I realised that the cookies domain was localhost and subsequent calls to the service would not send the cookie over. This is still a partial unknown as to why it wont send the cookie back over, but it is presumed that it is because the actual service resides upon localhost1893 not localhost like the domain says.p  pSo... I changed the domain in the service to correctly reflect the port number, so it was then localhost1893. However when the CORS request happens now, it receives the cookie in the response you can see it in the firebug response, however the cookie is gray and doesnt appear in the actual cookies section of firebug.p  pCould anyone shed any light on thisp  ul liUsing Firefox 5li liUsing jquery 1.6.1li liXHR has withCredentials set correctlyli liServer returns correct CORS headersli ul

Negative 1156 pIm using a few codeUIGestureRecognizercodes to pan, rotate and scale a view, which resides inside a scroll view.p  pMy problem is that sometimes the scroll view eats the touches embeforeem the gesture recognizers do, so when this happens I end up zooming the scroll view instead of dragging the view. It doesnt happen all the time. I still cant describe how to reproduce this behavior.p  pIm pretty sure this can be solved in some way. For example codeMPMoviePlayerControllercode doesnt have this problem in fact, you can put it in a scroll view, and when you pinch it, it works just fine i.e. it doesnt zoom the outer scroll view too. Does anyone know how does codeMPMoviePlayerControllercode achieve thisp  pIve already searched for answers on SO, with no results. Thanks p

Negative 1156 pFirst of all, sorry for the vague title. I have no other ideas of what could possibly be put there, but youll see this for yourself as you read on.p  pI am a very new Java developer for android and a martian to game development, therefore my question is not so related to particulars as it is related to theory and possibilities.p  pIm interested in how I can develop my game so if holding the phone horizontally and it is tilted one way or another, an object will move in that direction. Im sure this is very common and easily done but what about if I wanted the top speed to increase the further it was turned, and the acceleration to increase the quicker it was turnedp  pI honestly have no idea of the complexity of this question, whether you will laugh and give me one line of code or whether its something you just cant teach.p  pEither way, thanks for reading, I look forward to your responses.p

Negative 1156 pIs it possible that nested calls of ioservice.runone is not a valid use of boostasio.p  pFor example I have a handler which is executed after something has been received on a socket. The ioservice is running in another thread with ioservice.runone. Hence in my opinion the ioservice will stop after serving the receive handler. p  pThen in the receive handler I am executing ioservice.runone again in order to send now something back over the socket. This means, that there is a nestedrecursive call of ioservice.runone method. p  pThis behavior doesnt really work. I mean sometimes there is a block in the runone method which never returns. I couldnt also find any documentation handling about this particular case.p  pSo, is it allowed to have recursivenested ioservice execution at all or is this not a well behaviorp  pP.S. ioservice.reset is used in front of every runone execution.p

Negative 1156 pOn my site there is currently an algorithm ranking content by pointsage. We want to introduce user specific ranking based on a users preference. So for example something like pointsageuserPreference The only problem is currently to reduce server load we are caching the ranks in the database because calculating the rank for every piece of content on page load would take too long.  Now we want user specific ranking this would no longer work because the rank would be different for each user. How could we go about implementing this without having to recalculate the rank of all the content each page loadp

Negative 1156 pI am programming WP7 application adhering the MVVM pattern.p  pI have ViewModelLocator which ensures that each instance of ViewModel is only one. These ViewModels are created when application is launched. ViewModels communicating with each other using messages. I use messages for navigatig to next Page For this I am using NavigationService.Navigate, which is Raised from MainPage CodeBehind  it is the only functionality that is in CodeBehind . View and ViewModels are connected together by setting the DataContext in the Page to ViewModelLocator.p  pEverythig works at first sight.p  pBut during each navigation, there is created new Page instance, which is connected to the ViewModel from ViewModelLocatorwhich is designed for it. The result is that when a user often switches between pages, there are multiple instances of a page connected to one ViewModel. Of course, there is visible only one page at one point.p  pVery simple solution could be setting NavigationCache, but it is readonly in WP7.p  pI am looking for solution of unwanted behavior.p

PasswordBox does not provide Password as dependency property. I did not want to break the MVVM guideline of trying to avoid code behind as much as possible and so was tempted to go for the a hrefhttpblog.functionalfun.net200806wpfpasswordboxanddatabinding.html relnofollowPasswordBoxAssistanta class mentioned a hrefhttpblog.functionalfun.net200806wpfpasswordboxanddatabinding.html relnofollowherea. This otherwise is a nice solution, save one thing. It is not letting me validate the Password Box with Joshs data template.  I have validated the password property of my ViewModel for not being empty. The property, very well is getting validated as my Login button is not getting enabled without the user filling in password. But the Enter password message that I did set as a part of this property validation is not being rendered by the Content presenter that lies below the PasswordBox. here goes the codep  precodeltLabel ContentPassword Grid.Column0 Grid.Row2 Margin2 gt             ltPasswordBox xNamePasswordBox Grid.Row2 Grid.Column1 Grid.ColumnSpan2 Margin2 Validation.ErrorTemplatexNull                    ffPasswordBoxAssistant.BindPasswordtrue                     ffPasswordBoxAssistant.BoundPasswordBinding PathPassword, ModeTwoWay, UpdateSourceTriggerPropertyChangedgt ltContentPresenter            Grid.Row3 Grid.Column1 Grid.ColumnSpan2           ContentBinding ElementNamePasswordBox, PathValidation.Errors.CurrentItemgt codepre  pNeedless to say that the ff in the above code stands for the namespace referencep  precodexmlnsffclrnamespaceMyProject.UserViews codepre  pI am sure, this problem is happening because the Password property has got extended by the helper class. If I drop this approach, I will have to remove the Password property from the IDataErrorInfo Implementation and on Login button click will have to verify it, presenting the user with a message box. But not without compromising consistency. I am sorry for having you read so much, but I am not much aware of Dependency Properties, can there be any workaround Will altering the helper class in someway, let me have the red error message back in placep  pEDIT Edited the xaml code for PasswordBox.p

Negative 1156 pIve been working for a couple of days on grabbing frames from a phonon media object. My aim is to capture frames at some interval specified by the user. I firstly tried to implement a slot for the tick signal associated with PhononMediaObject. However because the tick signal is emitted at the first opportunity there can sometimes be a little variety in the time difference... not so much that its not a workable solution but still I investigated further and tried a combination of seek and grabWidget but it appears that seek takes some time to complete and does not have any way to notify the application when the video is running fine again, this causes code like p  precodeobjgtseekimgrabInterval QPixmap image  QPixmapgrabWidgetmui.videoPlayer codepre  pto save out a black image 90 of the time, but correctly grab the frame the remaining times. p  pMy question is is there anything I can do about either of these two ideas that will make them work better for me, or am I barking heavily up the wrong tree and there is a much more  obvious I have missed completelyp  pThanks in advance p

Negative 1156 pstrongGoalstrong I have an adjusted codepairscode plot in codeRcode and I would like to add a color key to it. The panel backgrounds in the codepairscode plot show certain colors determined from a matrix of numbers. I would like to have a color key to the right of the codepairscode plot which shows these colors and some labels indicating the numbers.  p  pI found some ways how to add color keys to codeimagecode plots for example, codeimage.plotcode in the codefieldscode package codecolorbarcode in the codematlabcode package codecolor.legendcode in the codeplotrixcode package. So, in principle, I would like to do something similar for my adjusted codepairscode plot. However, I already run into trouble with reserving some space for the color key to be plotted to can [or even emshouldem] this be done with codegridcode. p  pHere is a minimal example of a codepairscode plot that has colored backgrounds.

The numbers are all in between 0 and 1 and 0 1 corresponds to the darkest brightest color. Those numbers should then determine the ticks and numbers printed at the color key I dont need actual text labels  I just tried that since the example of codecolor.legendcode used it. So a vector of numbers for codecolorscode above could be codec0.95, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 1, 1code the larger the number the brighter the column. To be more precise These values are pvalues determined by goodnessoffit tests for each pair and the dark color should point out small pvalues. Indeed, the colors are not that evenly spaced, I only use some colors above the significance level of for example 0.05, and most of the colors below 0.05, so one can directly see which tests lead to rejection.p

onSortCol, and beginSearch methods to call back to the web service and refresh the grid data in the callback.p  pThe data is supplied in a format consumable by jqGrid I can easily map it via the jsonReader optionp  precodejsonReader      repeatitems false,     root Rows,     page Page,     total TotalPages,     records RecordCount,     userdata FooterTotals,     id ClaimId , codepre  pI pass in the data via the datastr option and set the datatype to jsonstring.p  ploadonce is set to false ive tried it both ways and my rowNum is set to 10.p  pWhen I make the initial call a dataset with 900 records comes back, and the grid displays the first 10 records, strongbut the pager is ignoring the total amp records and thinks i only have 1 page of datastrong.p  pthe root data is not being ignored it displays 10 records and the userdata is not being ignored i.e. the footer is rendering correctly.  so the grid is selectively ignoring the total and records data from the datastr.p  pMy question is  does using datatypejsonstring and datastr and supplying json to the grid instead of using the url prohibit the ability to take advantage of server side pagingsortingfilteringp  pif so, is there a way to accomplish what Im afterp  pnote that if i return the entire 900 count record set and set loadonce to true, everything works fine, albeit clientside.p  pmy entire jqGrid, for referencep

Negative 1156 pDoes it make sense to simply copy the mysqldata files vs mysql replication between data centers I am having the impression mysql replication might be complex when done cross data center. And if I just copy, I could easily switch to the other data center wo worrying if its primary or slave. Any thoughtsp
Negative 1156 pFor example, there are 5 object stores. I am thinking of inserting documents into them, but not in sequential order. Initially it might be sequential, but if i could insert by using some ranking method it would be easier to know which object store to search to find the document. The goal is to reduce the number of object store searches. This can only be achieved if the insertion uses some intelligent algorithm.p  pOne method i found useful is using the current year MOD N number of object stores to determine where a document goes. Could we have some better approaches to thisp

Id prefer all database connection data reside in application.ini.p  pIs there a way, within my daemon class, to initialize my Zend Framework application so I can use the models p

Negative 1156 pI have a build process that compiles LESS code into CSS, which will then be injected into a JavaScript string litteral, and concatenated with the main minified .js code.

Say I have a class that looks like thisp  precodeinterface MyClass  NSObject  property nonatomic, copy NSSNumber myVar  end codepre  pGiven myVar, I want to get myVar. Then I could use it in a log like thisp  precodeMyClass myObject  [[myClass alloc] init] NSLogThe variable is named , getVarName[myObject myVar] codepre  pThen the log would say codeThe variable is named myVarcode. Thank you for your helpp  pPS The reason I want to do this is to create a method for encoding variables for archiving. So when I write my codeencodeWithCodercode method I can just do something like thisp  precode voidencodeWithCoderNSCoder aCoder      NSArray varsForEncoding  [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjectsvar1, var2, var3, nil]     for NSObject var in varsForEncoding              [aCoder encodeObjectvar forKeygetVarNamevar]       codepre  pThen do the reverse in codeinitWithCodercode. That would prevent typos screwing this up, e.g. using key codemyVarcode when encoding but typing codemVarcode in the initializer.p

Negative 1156 pI am currently figuring out how to restructure the architecture of an existing not very modular ASP.NET MVC 3.0 application. I have a plugin like structure in mind to make the existing project extensible. p  pI have searched for different strategies to make modular web applications and found the following. I would like you to comment on these ideas. p  ul listrongMVC Areas in separate Projectsstrong li ul  pFor each plugin I want to create an individual ASP.NET MVC project that contains controllers, views and view models for the plugin. An Employee Module would contain an Area to list, create, update and delete employees. However this sounds good, AreaRegistration required to place all areas in the bin directory. I found a way to place my Area projects directly in the Areas folder and resolve the Area assemblies from the Areas[AreaName]bin folderp  precodeBuildManager.AddReferencedAssembly.AddAssembly.LoadFrom AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve  ResolveAssemblies codepre  pThis is working quite well and allows me to deploy plugins in the Areas folder of the main project. I like that I am using the Areas feature which is provided out of the box by ASP.NET MVC.p  ul listrongMVC Portal Areas MVCContribstrongli ul  pa hrefhttpelegantcode.com20120406mvcportableareashttpelegantcode.com20120406mvcportableareasap  pPortable Areas do not seem to be a good approach, since they require that views are compiled as embedded resources in the Area project file. This would prevent IIS caching. On the other hand I really cannot imagine how big the performance drawback really is. p  ul listrongMVC based Modules using MEFstrongli ul  pa hrefhttpwww.fidelitydesign.netp104httpwww.fidelitydesign.netp104a p  pIn order to create loosely coupled services in other projects I heavily rely on MEF. Thus I thought it would be a great idea to use it to discover ASP.NET MVC ModulesPlugins. I would end up using a ControllerFactory that would instantiate Controllers exported by using the Export attribute. This way I would have full control over the plugin instantiation and could use MEF to get services. However using MEF really requires much more work than using MVC Areas, which resolve controllers out of the box. p  ul listrongEntity Framework across Plugin projectsstrongli ul  pOne problem, I was unable to solve so far, is how to distribute the entities across the individual plugin projects. Currently we use a Database First approach, which consists of one .edmx model file that contains all entities. Even with DbContext or Code First it is not possible to use multiple DbContext classes for one database. One idea would be to use MEF to load entities from different plugins into a central DbContext class. However I do not know whether this is a supported andor recommended setup.p

Negative 1156 pI want to minimize trafficstorage costs on GAE.p  pUsers fill out a form, checking boxes to select options which are lines of text, eg I wake up two or more times during the night. or I sleep less than 7 hours per night. or I usually have trouble falling asleep.p  pI want to store the users selections using the datastore. I suppose I can save on storage space by giving each selection a unique identifier. Then Ill just store for example 342, 554, 106 instead of three long lines of text... Then retrieve those numbers and translate them back into sentences next time loading the page for each user. p  pMy question is, will it be better to do that conversion on the client side, or the server side p  pObviously, doing the conversion on the client side will mean sending LESS data from client to server for storage  which is good. However, it would mean sending MORE data from server to client, considering the additional lines of clientside javascript necessary to facilitate the conversion, which they will be downloaded as part of the page source  and that could be bad. p

Negative 1156 pWorking on a project for class specific to the college network.p  pThe idea is that if we can fetch an identifying characteristic of the web sessionconnection on campus, we can map out and associate the AP with their location coordinates and plot them on a map. More specifically, were trying to determine which AP the device is connected to. p  pBasically the user would bring up a webpage on the intranet from a wifi enabled device preferably an iPad or iPod Touch, and either on the page load or through an action event an unique identifier is captured which we could in turn associate with lat amp long coordinates. The idea here is that the unique identifier would be sent and stored into to a DB field almost like a guestbook submission. Then, externally on a separate public webpage  viewers would be able to see these unique identifiers returned and translated as the most recently visited locations plotted on a map. This would translate to a manual checkin tracking service. p  pCapturing the IP address will not work as they are not static. p

Negative 1156 pAs I am having an application with 135 screens.I know it will be a stupid plan for an application but unfortunately this is the requirement.As we are planning to make all the screens as html then putting it in assets then reading it to a string and loading it in two webviews. It should load with animations.So we are using 2 webviews.p  pI dont know how much efficient this method will be.As I read in most of the blogs and forums.This will make a lot of performance issues.Now my problem is that I am trying to load 4 htmls in 2 webviews correspondingly and applying the animations to the webview. This 2 webview will be in a frame layout.When I do the same I am getting many problems listed below.p  ol liWebview is flickering.li liWhen the animation happens sometimes unloaded htmls are shown in between which is been previously loaded.li liSometimes the page is not loading it will only show if any user interaction happen on the screen.li liSome times a white page is shown in between loading two pages.li ol  pFlickering and white page between are the main problems am facing.Can any one let me know how we can solve these issues.I am really struggling to get this done.If this is not the efficient approach to load 135 htmls let me know the best one.Some piece of code is mentioned below just to show how am tackling this....Thanksss in advance..p  precodewv1.loadDataWithBaseURLfileandroidasset,                         readFromAssestsrechercherunjob.html, texthtml,                         UTF8, null                  animrighttoleftin  AnimationUtils.loadAnimationgetBaseContext, R.anim.righttoleftin                 animlefttorightout  AnimationUtils.loadAnimationgetBaseContext, R.anim.righttoleftout                  animlefttorightout.setAnimationListenernew AnimationListener                              Override                             public void onAnimationStartAnimation animation                                  wv1.bringToFront                                                           Override                             public void onAnimationRepeatAnimation animation                                                           Override                             public void onAnimationEndAnimation animation                                  runOnUiThreadnew Runnable                                      public void run                                          Toast.makeTextLoadHTMLActivity.this,                                                 anim end 2,                                                 Toast.LENGTHSHORT.show                                                                                                       wv2.loadDataWithBaseURL                                         fileandroidasset,                                         readFromAssestsblank.html,                                         texthtml, UTF8, null                                                                         final Handler Handler1  new Handler                 Runnable mUpdateTimeTask1  new Runnable                      public void run                           wv1.setAnimationanimrighttoleftin                         wv2.setAnimationanimlefttorightout                                                       Handler1.postDelayedmUpdateTimeTask1, 1000 codepre

Negative 1156 pI have an existing JTAPI application that Im going to be enhancing and refactoring.  One of the first concerns is if the new enhancements will scale reasonably well to larger number of IP phones.  Ive done scalability testing of web services by simulating web service clients with threads, and that approach works well for determining if web services will scale.p  pNow Im trying to come up with a way to simulate increasing numbers of IP phones on a network because I obviously dont want to have to build a real network with hundreds or thousands of IP phones.p  pIll start with simple JTAPI operations like querying each device on the network to determine which ones are busy, but more complex operations will also have to be tested.p  pI could build a network of 10 IP phones and scale out that network by repeating each JTAPI operation N times for each phone.  I would test with N  1, 3, 7, 10, 30, 70, 100, 300, ...  One potential problem with this approach is that the results could end up heavily skewed by the latency of the IP phones in responding to multiple JTAPI operations instead of showing the scalability of a larger network of IP phones responding to a single JTAPI operation.p  pAnother approach is to setup a network of IP soft phones and scale that out, but I dont think IP soft phones would behave like a real IP phone in terms of latency and responding to JTAPI operations.p  pHow have others tested the scalability of their JTAPI applicationsp  pThanks.p

One VC fetches based on names and only wants to present names in a tableview thus only holds the name data from the fetched NSManagedObjects in memory, not the rest of the object.p  pThis allows selected data to be held in memory, How is the memory used when more than one VC is holding onto the same data at once Will there be copies of this data for each reference or are the NSManagedObjects backing data the single entry in CoreDatap  pIf so, does CoreData use virtual memory mapping for on demand reading of these single instances or is the actual data loaded into memory as copiesp

Negative 1156 pFor a Confirm Order page in application written in PHP I need to prevent multiple form submissions so we dont get duplicate orders.  I have attempted to handle this in two waysp  ol liFor users supporting javascript the submit button is disabled on clickli liA token is generated with the form and stored in session.  On the first submit theyre compared and the session token is removed.  Subsequent submissions without a matching token should therefore be rejected.  This should have the added benefit of preventing CSRF attacks.li ol  pI understand that both are fairly standard practice, yet the issue seems to remain  With js disabled if I click the submit button several times I will get X number of duplicate orders.p  pThis makes me think that perhaps the issue is config related.  It is hosted on lighthttpd and php is compiled with cgifcgi.  Im not entirely sure if that is even relevant but I am baffled as to how this is now possible.p  pThe server code is as follows cut down for brevityp  precodeltphp     SESSION[token]  uniqid, true gt ltform namemyform actionconfirm methodPOSTgt   lt.... gt  ltinput typehidden namecsrftoken valueltphp echo SESSION[token] gt gt  ltinput typesubmit namesubmit gt codepre  pp  pThen on submit the token is verifiedp  precodeltphp    if POST[csrftoken]  SESSION[token]         proceed and process order        unsetSESSION[token]      gt codepre  pSession is started and the token is correctly generated and subsequently unset.p  pI have used this approach in the past with no problems but this time round it still seems to get through.

Negative 1156 pI can not find why the background of my subview shrinks toward the upper left corner of the subview the first time I move it or animate it.  not sure if it is technically a subview since the object I dragged on to my main view was labeled Viewp  pFor this example, I will provide an animated example so that you can see what is going on easier.p  pHere are my .h entries 2 objects, a button and a viewp  precodeproperty weak, nonatomic IBOutlet UIView floatPad  IBActiontoggleButtonUIButton sender codepre  pFor this example iPad the view is located at 20, 800 with a size of 728, 186.  I also set the background to light grey in the Interface Builder to show whats going on better.p  pThe button toggles the view on and off the screen, sliding via animation code off and on through the bottom of the screen.p  pHere are my .m entries 1 BOOL, 1 UIColor, plus the viewDidLoad and toggleButton codep  precodeinterface ViewController   property assign, nonatomic BOOL floatPadVisible property retain, nonatomic UIColor redBackground  end  implementation ViewController  synthesize floatPad synthesize floatPadVisible synthesize redBackground   voidviewDidLoad  floatPadVisibleYES     redBackground  [UIColor colorWithRed179255.0 green1255.0 blue54255.0 alpha1.0]      [super viewDidLoad]    IBActiontoggleButtonUIButton sender   if floatPadVisible  is floatPadVisible BOOL set to YES     [UIView beginAnimationsfloatPad contextnil]     [UIView setAnimationDuration1.5]     [UIView setAnimationDelegateself]     [floatPad setFrameCGRectMake20, 1004, 584, 145]     [floatPad setBackgroundColorredBackground]     [UIView commitAnimations]     floatPadVisible  NO      else      [UIView beginAnimationsfloatPad contextnil]     [UIView setAnimationDuration1.5]     [UIView setAnimationDelegateself]     [floatPad setFrameCGRectMake20, 800, 584, 145]     [UIView commitAnimations]     floatPadVisible  YES       codepre  pThe problem is that the first time you hit the toggle button, the view doesnt move, only the background shrinks.  I say shrinks, because you can still the the 20 point space on the left side of the view.  If you put an object inside the view, it doesnt move, which tells me the view isnt shrinking, only the background.  After the first toggle the button operates as expected.  I added the background change color code to show that the first toggle never calls the animation code, evident by the fact that the background doesnt change color until the second toggle.p

Negative 1156 pIm experimenting a lot with Reactive Extensions and right now Im trying to make a system in which I can queue procedures and execute them in whatever fashion I want while being able to send notifications to subscribers. p  pI currently have my database access encapsulated within a UserAccess class that exposes the method to add a user. In that method I would like to queue an action that adds a user to the database. So I made a JobProcessor of T class that exposes a method QueueJobAction and have my User implement this class. My problem is I cant see how to call the Action from within the OnNext method of the Observable because the action takes a User parameter.p  pMy angle of attack must be wrong and there must be a problem with my grasp of the design.

Negative 1156 pI am currently getting codeSendFailedExceptioncode because my sendmail instance has some email addresses blacklisted to filter out all emails to nondevelopers during testing.  But codeSendFailedExceptioncode could also indicate a failure to connect to the SMTP server or something else.  When this exception occurs because the email is blacklisted, I need to ignore the message and continue, but any other exception should be allowed to propagate out of my method. When I look at the JavaMail API, it appears that codeSendFailedExceptioncode is the lowest level of exception I can get the last one in the codejavax.mailcode package.  What I really need is is the underlying a hrefhttpjavamail.kenai.comnonavjavadocscomsunmailsmtpSMTPSendFailedException.html relnofollowSMTPSendFailedExceptiona, but that is in the codecom.sun.mailcode package, and, as far as I understand, that means it is implementation specific and should not be used.  However, that class actually has a codegetReturnCodecode method that could be used to differentiate between codeSendFailedExceptioncodes.  Is there a better way to do this  Is it safe to use codecom.sun.mailcode classes  Any suggestionsp

Negative 1156 pIm having an issue with a multithreaded server Im building as an academic exercise, more specifically with getting a connection to close down gracefully.  p  pEach connection is managed by a Session class.  This class maintains 2 threads for the connection, a DownstreamThread and an UpstreamThread. p  pThe UpstreamThread blocks on the client socket and encodes all incoming strings into messages to be passed up to another layer to deal with.  The DownstreamThread blocks on a BlockingQueue into which messages for the client are inserted.  When theres a message on the queue, the Downstream thread takes the message off the queue, turns it into a string and sends it to the client. In the final system, an application layer will act on incoming messages and push outgoing messages down to the server to send to the appropriate client, but for now I just have a simple application that sleeps for a second on an incoming message before echoing it back as an outgoing message with a timestamp appended.  p  pThe problem Im having is getting the whole thing to shut down gracefully when the client disconnects.  The first issue Im contending with is a normal disconnect, where the client lets the server know that its ending the connection with a QUIT command.  The basic pseudocode is p  precodewhile quitting      inputString  socket.readLine   blocks     if inputString  QUIT           forward the message upstream         server.acceptMessage inputString      else           Do cleanup         quitting  true         socket.close        codepre  pThe upstream threads main loop looks at the input string.  If its QUIT the thread sets a flag to say that the client has ended communications and exits the loop.  This leads to the upstream thread shutting down nicely.  p  pThe downstream threads main loop waits for messages in the BlockingQueue for as long as the connection closing flag isnt set.  When it is, the downstream thread is also supposed to terminate.  However, it doesnt, it just sits there waiting.  Its psuedocode looks like this p  precodewhile quitting      outputMessage  messageQueue.take   blocks     sendMessageToClient outputMessage  codepre  pWhen I tested this, I noticed that when the client quit, the upstream thread shut down, but the downstream thread didnt.  p  pAfter a bit of head scratching, I realised that the downstream thread is still blocking on the BlockingQueue waiting for an incoming message that will never come.  The upstream thread doesnt forward the QUIT message any further up the chain.  p  pHow can I make the downstream thread shut down gracefully  The first idea that sprang to mind was setting a timeout on the take call.  Im not too keen on this idea though, because whatever value you select, its bound to be not entirely satisfactory.  Either its too long and a zombie thread sits there for a long time before shutting down, or its too short and connections that have idled for a few minutes but are still valid will be killed.  I did think of sending the QUIT message up the chain, but that requires it to make a full round trip to the server, then the application, then back down to the server again and finally to the session.  This doesnt seem like an elegant solution either.  p  pI did look at the documentation for Thread.stop but thats apparently deprecated because it never worked properly anyway, so that looks like its not really an option either.  Another idea I had was to force an exception to be triggered in the downstream thread somehow and let it clean up in its finally block, but this strikes me as a horrible and kludgey idea.  p  pI feel that both threads should be able to gracefully shutdown on their own, but I also suspect that if one thread ends it must also signal the other thread to end in a more proactive way than simply setting a flag for the other thread to check.  As Im still not very experienced with Java, Im rather out of ideas at this point.  If anyone has any advice, it would be greatly appreciated.  p  pFor the sake of completeness, Ive included the real code for the Session class below, though I believe the pseudocode snippets above cover the relevant parts of the problem.  The full class is about 250 lines.  p  precodeimport java.io. import java.net. import java.util.concurrent. import java.util.logging.

Negative 1156 pstrongEDIT I found a way to disable the warnings from thirdparty codes using GCC. Look at this post right here a hrefhttpsphaleron.blogspot.se201106ignoringgccwarningsonperfilebasis.html relnofollowhttpsphaleron.blogspot.se201106ignoringgccwarningsonperfilebasis.htmla Or as bames53 post saidstrongp  pIve just upgraded my GCC compiler and all of a sudden I got loads of warnings I never had before.

Anyway, I was starting to fix these warnings because why not when I checked for new ones and to my surprise I received over 100 warnings from the glew file I added to be able to draw with OpenGL more efficiently. I have no plans to go into that code just to fix warnings. p  pWhat would you have done How important is this If I dont fix them is there a way for me to remove these warningsp  pstrongClarificationstrong I always fix more severe warnings, its just that all the warnings from my code are Narrowing warnings in glew.c its emwarning variable redeclared without dllimport attribute previous dllimport ignored [Wattributes]em and Im wondering how important it is to fix these, especially since glew threw a whole bunch at me.p

Negative 1156 pI got Python embedded into a PyQt4 app back when it was in the beta stages and only worked on a git branch of Ipython.

Negative 1156 pIm trying to code something using X11 related libraries such as codeXlibcode and codeXrandrcode.p  pAt first I was expecting a full coverage of the real basic functions such as retrieving the refresh rate from the monitors from codeXlibcode alone, later on I find out that I need codeXrandrcode for that.p  pNow I need to get the list of all the windows displayed or hidden in the desktop, Im not thinking about using GnomeKDEXFCE ... extensions because I know that those are just decorators for X11, but I cant really find a function or a macro that is able to enumerate the open windows in the X server. I also need to get the IDname of the window that is under focus.p  pMy question is codeXlibcode alone is capable of doing this  Because from the terminology that Xlib adopts, I have my doubts that this functions could possibly even exist.p

I dont know how With the completely meaningless interrupt, it works. Without it, same result as before  hangs with no output. Apparently, FreeDos doesnt like codeint 13hcode as the first interrupt. No idea why. I dont recall ever seeing anything like this before.

My goal is to not associate locations to users individually, but rather for users to add and remove them, one or more at a time, via another field codezipcodecode.  This means that when a user adds a zip code, ActiveRecord should insert a single record into UserLocations something like codeINSERT INTO userlocations userid, zipcode VALUES 1, 12345code.

Negative 1156 pOptimization in modern compilers is getting better and better with basic optimizations like constant folding to utilizing SIMD instructions. However, I wonder how far these kind of optimizations should be taken and how this decision is made by compilers nowadays.p  pLets look at an examplep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  static double naivesindouble n      return n  nnn  6.0  nnnnn  120.0  nnnnnnn  5040.0   int main      printffn, naivesin1.0      return 0  codepre  pWhen compiling this with GCC with codeO3code, it can be observed that the resulting floating point number is calculated by the compiler and stored in the source code. Optimizing further than that is obviously not possible.p  pNow, lets look at a second examplep  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt  int main      double start  0.0      for int i  0 i lt 100 i          start  1.0           printffn, start      return 0  codepre  pWith the result of the first example in mind, one could expect the compiler to apply similar optimization and produce the constant code100.0code in the resulting machine code. However, when looking at the output, it turns out that the loop is still therep  pObviously this kind of optimization is not always possible. Lets say you were writing a program that calculates pi to a million places. Such a program requires no user input, so theoretically the result could be hardcoded into the machine code by the compiler. Of course this is not a good idea, because the compiler will take much longer to internally evaluate a program like that as opposed to just running the less optimized version.p  pStill, what makes the compiler decide to not optimize the loop in this case Are there languagescompilers that optimize this kind of code or is there something preventing this Is it perhaps related to the concept of not being able to predict if a program is ever going to endp

Negative 1156 pI am currently working on a project where there are client systems, user systems and a server. For our example lets use strongClient Astrong, strongServerstrong, strongUser A.strong p  pstrongClient Astrong sends a keep alive packet to the server and the server stores the socket info as a hashmap list with the client ids. This way more number of clients can add into the hashmap list.p  pstrongUser Astrong wants to send an information to strongclient Astrong, so it connects to the server to send a message to strongclient Astrong. The server fetches the relevant socket information from the hashmaplist and passes it over to strongUser Astrong or the server ties up both the sockets together.p  pA bit clueless in this part of merging sockets together. Any views or suggestions is appreciated. Currently I am trying out ZeroMQ but not getting anywhere with it, any other frameworks, apis or libraries I can look intop

Negative 1156 pI have MVC3 application that draws some charts using gRaphael library.

I know that server side rendering is faster and more preferable approach but i also know that gRaphael library doesnt support server rendering out of the box and it still needs some JavaScript to be executed on client side. I heard about PhantomJS as a work around but I am not familiar with it and i also heard that there are some issues using it for SVG rendering.p  pSo my questions are p  ol liShould i even try to find a solution to render those charts on server side Will i get major performance improvements by moving the rendering to server sideli ol  pAnd if i should, what is the best practice to do itp  pThanks in advancep

I wrote p  precodes  os.Args[1] maxLetters, err  strconv.Atois if err  nil       handle error     fmt.Printlnerr     os.Exit2  codepre  pWhich takes the string 8, converts it to an integer, and allows me to set it as a max number in my game.  However, they have the option to not enter a number.  In this case the max number gets defaulted to 7 in my program.  My question is how do I check in golang if os.Args[1] exists or not  If it exists, set max to the users number.  If it doesnt exist, set max  7.p  p2...During the game, there needs to be user input.  flags help, incorrect guess word entry makes them try again, correct guess word entry gives them the next question, and simply hitting the return key a blank line exits the game.  I use p  precodevar answer string fmt.Scanfs, ampanswer codepre  pTo obtain their entry.  The problem is the  entry, or blank line entry, is not recognized.  Hitting the return key does not change the value of answer, therefore answer stays the same. , and the game proceeds with their previous entry still as the answer value. Obviously this is a big problem and the answer value needs to change to  or some sort upon hitting the return key.p  pAny suggestions  Thanks for any help.p

This almost works fine, except that if I open and close the same document repeatedly without closing the App then each time its windows height is increased a small amount 26 pixels, almost like its doing the cascade thing.  However if I close the App completely and reopen it then the document remembers its previous position exactly.  Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug.

Negative 1156 pI have a view controller inside a navigation bar that pushes a tab bar view controller which has 4 tabs and view controllers to go with it. When I codeNSLog, self.navigationControllercode inside TabBarViewControllers viewDidLoad it comes up as null.

It is weird because I have a selector, for the back button, called dismissTab and I pop the view controller and it works. If I NSLog there it doesnt come up as null so something is wrong somewhere. I have a feeling that this is the reason that my ViewControllers, for each of the tabs, is being hidden by the NavigationBar and TabBar.

Negative 1156 pIn both Hue and Solr dynamic fields cause issues.  In Hue, data that is stored as a dynamic field refuses to appear in the default Solr search, which displays all available data from the imported collection.  It also fails to search for this data which is of the textgeneral type and is indexed and stored.  In Solr, it seems that the dynamic fields are not indexed even though the schema settings are like sop  precode   ltdynamicField namet  typetextgeneral    indexedtrue  storedtruegt    ltdynamicField nametxt typetextgeneral   indexedtrue  storedtrue multiValuedtruegt codepre  pThese settings are exactly the same as the normal field name which is token searchable and appears in the Solr Search in Hue.p  precode   ltfield namename typetextgeneral indexedtrue storedtruegt codepre  pMy goal was to use the tag and attribute names as the field names in the indexing, the values being indexed.

But if I search the word Precinct from the policeprecinctt field, my search returns nothing.  All of this is in the Solr administrative window reached by going to codehttpHOST8983solr.code  p  pIn Hue, I have even sparser information.

The dynamic field data doesnt even show up in Hue like it does in the Solr Administrative panel, but I can search the data the same way I can in the Solr Query window.  If I type in boroughtQUEENS I get all the results where that exact field and value match, in both Hue and Solr Query.  This does not allow for token matching and doesnt match the expected behavior of the declared dynamic field or its attributes thats given above.  Im using the example schema.xml thats given with Solr in collection1.  Ive checked to make sure there arent any other dynamic fields with the glob t to conflict and negate or error the field when its set.  p  pSolr is very simple to use and, with some reading, to understand, but I cant seem to find an answer for why solr refuses to work as expected.  Im using SolrJ to index my files into Solr, and then Im using both the Solr Admin Panel and Solr Search in Hue 2.5 to interact with the indexed data.p  pAn example of my XML data, pulled from the a hrefhttpsnycopendata.socrata.com relnofollowNYC Open Data Sitea, will not format properly, but if youre really interested you can look up the Firehouse Location and Graffiti Location data and export the xml.  That is the data Im putting into Solr. My solutions that I can see seem to be writing hardcoded interpretation code that assigns each tag value to an exact field with the textgeneral settings or creating the fields on the fly, which doesnt seem much different from dynamic fields.  I would love to figure out how to get dynamic fields to work as I expect them to.p  pThank you in advance.p

Negative 1156 pbasically Im solving the assembly line scheduling problem in a recursion way, based on the formula provided a hrefhttpwww.geeksforgeeks.orgdynamicprogrammingset34assemblylinescheduling relnofollowhereap  pThe following information can be extracted from the problem statement to make it simplerp  pTwo assembly lines, 1 and 2, each with stations from 1 to n.p  pA car chassis must pass through all stations from 1 to n in orderin any of the two assembly lines. i.e. it cannot jump from station i to station j if they are not at one move distance.p  pThe car chassis can move one station forward in the same line, or one station diagonally in the other line. It incurs an extra cost ti, j to move to station j from line i. No cost is incurred for movement in same line.p  pThe time taken in station j on line i is ai,j.p  pSi,j represents a station j on line i.p  pBreaking the problem into smaller subproblems We can easily find the ith factorial if i1th factorial is known. Can we apply the similar funda here If the minimum time taken by the chassis to leave station Si, j1 is known, the minimum time taken to leave station Si, j can be calculated quickly by combining ai, j and ti, j.p  pT1j indicates the minimum time taken by the car chassis to leave station j on assembly line 1.p  pT2j indicates the minimum time taken by the car chassis to leave station j on assembly line 2.p  pBase cases  The entry time ei comes into picture only when the car chassis enters the car factory.p  pTime taken to leave first station in line 1 is given by T11  Entry time in Line 1  Time spent in station S1,1 T11  e1  a1,1 Similarly, time taken to leave first station in line 2 is given by T21  e2  a2,1p  pRecursive Relations If we look at the problem statement, it quickly boils down to the below observations The car chassis at station S1,j can come either from station S1, j1 or station S2, j1.p  pCase 1 Its previous station is S1, j1 The minimum time to leave station S1,j is given by T1j  Minimum time taken to leave station S1, j1  Time spent in station S1, j T1j  T1j1  a1, jp  pCase 2 Its previous station is S2, j1 The minimum time to leave station S1, j is given by T1j  Minimum time taken to leave station S2, j1  Extra cost incurred to change the assembly line  Time spent in station S1, j T1j  T2j1  t2, j  a1, jp  pThe minimum time T1j is given by the minimum of the two obtained in cases 1 and 2.

In this div I have another div that has a ribbon as a background and contains the navigation. If the viewport is wide enough, I want to show everything from the inner div centered on the page. So far no problem by setting codemargin 0 autocode to the inner. However, when the viewport is less than the ribbons width, I would like to cut off the ribbon on the left side logically, on the right it is automatic to the point where it bends, thats the point where the buttons of the navigation begin 169px from left.

Negative 1156 pIm writing an IRC bot in python and I dont have a clear idea on how Im supposed to implement command substitution.

My goal would be to be able to do things like ddg random 100, which would generate a random number and search it on DDG.

At the moment the best solution I can come up with isp  precodefrom sympy import  z  symbolsz eq1  Eqz  1, 4 Eqeq1.lhs  1, eq1.rhs  1  Output  z  3 codepre  pWhere the more obvious expression codeeq1  1code only subtracts from the lefthand side. How can I use sympy to work through equalities stepbystep like this i.e. without getting the codesolvecode method to just given me the answer Any pointers to the manipulations that are actually possible with sympy equalities would be appreciated.p

Negative 1156 pIm looking for help in finding the source of jitter when using collision detection. Ive implemented a java game using eclipse and slick2d and have been loosely following this guide a hrefhttpkatyscode.wordpress.com201301182dplatformgamescollisiondetectionfordummies relnofollowhttpkatyscode.wordpress.com201301182dplatformgamescollisiondetectionfordummiesap  pbut of course changing bits where necessary to suit my game and java not cpp.p  pFrom the research I have done I think the root cause of my jitter is coming from rounding errors.  Despite that being my main suspect, I still havent been able to identify where its occurring.p  pSorry if the indentation isnt quite right there, had a little trouble using the code block recognition.p  pBasically Im creating variables in the class. In init I set up most of the resources. In render all the drawing takes place. Note the graphics translation so the camera follows the player. In update Im of course updating the position of the player according to user input, gravity and friction.p  pI also call my collision detection from this method. Collision detection is working on a penetration resolution method. p  pYes I know Im exhaustively comparing with every single world object. I will be improving my efficiency with AABBs when I have sorted more fundamental problems out. Like jitterp  pMy method first calculates how much the player expects to move in each axis, then for each world object it checks for intersection with the players bounding points floating point values that represent coordinates around the player. It checks this in each direction and uses the result to determine in which axis the collision occurred, if any, so that the appropriate action can be taken.p  pSorry its a put load of code, but its collision detection after all, which isnt a small thing.p  pHere is my Play class where all the updating goes on for the gamep  precodepackage GameFiles import java.io.BufferedReader import

During destruction, some of the jobs are done and it will be the time to call the code.notifycode. As the codeThreadpoolmutexcode during destruction is invalidated, exceptions occur during locking. your suggestion will be appreciated. p

Negative 1156 h1Effecth1  pI want to achieve the effect of a codeUIViewcode subclass implementing codedrawRectcode that can be scaled all the way down from fullsize to zerosize to make it vanish, then all the way back up from zerosize to fullsize to make it reappear.p  h1Requirementsh1  pI dont want to use codecontentModecode codeUIViewContentModeRedrawcode as this means a redraw every animation frame, which is slow.p  pId need to be able to create the original codeUIViewcode at fullsize, zerosize, or any size between. Regardless of the codeUIViewcodes emcreationem size, its codeCALayercodes size or whatever entity its bitmap is managed with should emalwaysem be that needed for the fullsize view. The codeCALayercode will then be scaled as necessary to the size of the codeUIViewcode for display.p  pA normal codeUIViewcode achieves this, provided that it begins life at the fullsize when codedrawRectcode is called and is then vanished down to zerosize. It fails if the codeUIViewcode begins at zerosize, and is then expanded up again to reappear it.p  pIf the technique works for standard codeUIViewcodes and not just my subclasses, thatd be even better.p  pThank you.p

Negative 1156 pcoderunSTcode is a Haskell function that statically constrains the usable lifetime of a resource through types. To do this it uses rank2 polymorphism.

Negative 1156 pIve got a strange situation with two SQL queries that arent producing the expected results. Here are the queriesp  pQuery 1p  pcodeSELECT DISTINCT SomeCharValue  FROM Table1  JOIN Table2  ON Table1.SomeCharValue  Table2.SomeCharValue  ORDER BY SomeCharValuecodep  pQuery 2p  pcodeSELECT DISTINCT SomeCharValue  FROM Table1  JOIN Table2  ON Table1.SomeCharValue ltgt Table2.SomeCharValue  ORDER BY SomeCharValuecodep  pI have two tables with columns of varchar15. Table2 is essentially a small subset of the values in Table1, thus Table1 has all values stored in Table2. The problem is, the two queries should never produce the same results, yet they do. Both queries will produce the same result for certain values for example, if Table1 and Table2 contain the word hello, then Query 1 should return it, while Query 2 should not. However, BOTH queries return hello. It doesnt make sense that hello in both tables is equal and not equal at the same time. I ran a length query to test the values, and some were a different size with trailing white spaces, but even after changing these to be an exact match, and verifying the hexadecimal value of the characters to be the same, the same results occur. I cant compare numeric key fields since there is no key relationship between these tables. I can only compare the exact character values in the columns. Any ideasp

Negative 1156 pI had a project that I had committed to github, strongMy Projectstrong. At one point I realized that strongMy Projectstrong is too large to contain in just one program i.e. front end amp back end, so I wanted to break it up into separate programs, but I still want it to be contained within one repository. I dont want to break up the code within strongMy Projectstrong and add a new directory within there because it is already a properly configured Android project, I want it to be completely separate from the back end. So what I want isp  pstrongProject Rootstrong strongMyProjectstrong, strongMyProject2strongp  pSomething like that, strongProject Rootstrong is the main directory which contains the code for the work Ive done so far in strongMy Projectstrong and strongMy Project2strong is the new work.

Negative 1156 pIm using the Win32 API for DHCP stuff, and following a code example from pinvoke.com Im finding that the sample code kills my app when I am impersonating a user, and works fine when I am not. I believe it has something to do with Marshal.FreeCoTaskMem andor Marshal.DestroyStructure but I dont understand why.p  pIm a bit scared of a memory leak, so I want to do this right.

Negative 1156 pI have started working on a project where a Postgres database is used as an integral component in the system architecture. This has forced me to abandon my previous notions that a database is well, to store things.p  pThere is an API which translates incoming requests into database queriesupdates. This causes triggers in the database to then notify another application to update the actual system accordingly.p  pTo me this all seems unnecessary. This is also in a fairly system critical architecture, and yet we have no way to guarantee knowledge of the underlying systems failure making it back up the chain since everything is Async. In short I dont like it at all. My view is we should restart from scratch immediately using direct communication between the API and the underlying system, using the database only to store persistant state updates  user information etc.p  pWhat im really looking for here is someone to explain to me why Im wrong before I end up falling out with the team, but all views are welcome.p

Negative 1156 pI know the question may be a bit offtopic on SO and understand the risk being downvoted, however lots of research have given me no results.br Basically the question is bCan i get the list of buildings having indoor maps for specific filters, particularly locationradiuscoordinatesb I mean, there definitely should be REST API for this task, however i couldnt find it out.p  pbEDIT1b a hrefhttpssupport.google.comgmmanswer1685827 relnofollowhttpssupport.google.comgmmanswer1685827a has the list of indoors, however its not exactly what i need. Exploring codeGMSIndoorBuildingcode class iOS SDK gives info like codeindoorIDcode, codeboundscode, codecentercode private properties... google has the way to obtain that info. Does anybody know any public APIs for thisp  pThank you for your time.p

Negative 1156 pI have a balance stored on a server in a database. I would like to have two apis p  ol liaddToBalanceamountToAdd  li lisubtractFromBalanceamountToSubtract li ol  pMy problem is as follows If a user is on a mobile and calls one of these then loses connection we have no way of telling if the balance was updated. So we do not know whether or not to retry.p  pA solution I came up with was to give the current balance as the client knows it to verify whether there has already been an update, the update should fail if the balance provided does not match the actual current balance. The problem with this solution is, if the balance is updated from elsewhere then the call will fail. We will not know whether to differentiate between the two failures so still do not know whether or not to retry.p  pDoes anyone have a possible solution to ensure that the same call does not get made multiple times to avoid multiple additions and subtractionsp  pThanks, Andy.p

Negative 1156 pIm currently implementing a movable gravity well that the player controls in Unity3D. The player can also add on an offset vector to the force of gravity that will affect its movement so it doesnt always go towards the center of the gravity well. Using these forces, I can determine the velocity each entity affected by the gravity well should go and its trajectory however, codeattributes.trajectorycode is continually added up until it reaches either  infinity and crashed the game. Logs show that that codegravityTrajectorycode and codegravityOffsetcode are at the correct vectors and speed at the time of crash is about 30 units. The logs show that codeattributes.trajectorycode isnt being properly normalized and will retain its magnitude.

Negative 1156 pI have a problem with a Mysql stored procedure running slow on an Amazon RDS instance.p  pIm currently migrating the Mysql database of a client to our own Mysql database using stored procedures. Both databases are on the same RDS instance. The instance class is db.m1.medium.p  pOne stored procedures copies approximately 2.600.000 records from one table in the clients database to 2 tables in our database.p  pWhen running this stored procedure on a local copy of our database on my laptop, it takes 1 hour 15 minutes. When running this stored procedure on the RDS instance it would take approximately 19 hours. Im calling the stored procedure from an EC2 instance in the same availability zone.p  pCan I make the stored procedure running faster on the RDS instancep  pEDIT 27012015 Last night the stored procedure crashed because of an out of memory exception.p  pI now changed the stored procedure. I wrapped all the inserts in one transaction for every row in the original table. I also made a work around for some select queries I did in the stored procedure so I dont have to do them anymore.p  pI also gave the RDS instance an SSD drive of 30 GB.p  pNow the stored procedures runs in 12 minutes on my laptop. But I estimate it will still need 8 hours on the Amazon RDS. How is this big difference possiblep  pstrongEDIT 28012015strong The procedure is still running. Estimated time has now increased to 31 hours and 15 minutes.p  pWhen I monitor my RDS instance, the amount Freeable Memory keeps going down. Is it possible that there is a memory leak in a stored procedurep

Negative 1156 pOur rails app acts as a gobetween for the UI and a javapowered API at the back. Basically, rails takes requests from the browser, tells the API what it needs, does some normalization and formatting, then hands it back to the browser.  Our app is ALSO an installed app, often without internet access. Oh, and it all gets compiled into a JRuby war.p  pCurrently, to get statuses of various things over time, were running some javascript intervals every X seconds.  Weve started discussing a better solution to this, but given the requirements above, AND required support for IE9, Im not sure what the best course of action is, or how to go about implementing it.  Basically, Im looking for some solid examples of either long polling in rails 3, or some kind of sockets implementation that will work for IE9  our wonky installationcompiling requirement.p  pId appreciate any thoughts or feedback.p
Negative 1156 pI have a classp  precodepublic class MyClass IMyInterface      int parameter    public Myclassint parameter            parameter  parameter        Do other things         public int FrequentlyCalledFunction               ifparameter  0                         return 0                    else                      int result            Do some calculations            return result                   codepre  pSince the parameter is assigned once in the constructor, entering the if statement every time the FrequentlyCalledFunction is called  seems somewhat inefficient for an already created instance .  Thus, I thought to modify the code as follows. Declare a delegate p  precodepublic delegate int MyDlg  public class MyClass IMyInterface      int parameter    MyDlg intermediate     public Myclassint parameter            parameter  parameter       intermediate  parameter  0  returnZero  calculateAndReturn         Do other things           public int FrequentlyCalledFunction             return intermediate           int returnZero             return 0              int calculateAndReturn               int result          Do some calculations          return result                     codepre  pSo now, the check will be performed only once at the moment of creating the instance. On the other hand the if statement is replaced with an additional delegate call.p  pThe question is, assuming that the performance is very important, which approach is betterp  pP.S. The FrequentlyCalledFunction is a method from the interface IMyInterface, thus, I cannot define a MyDlg FrequentlyCalledFunction and call it from the outside of the class.p

Negative 1156 pI have a question which may not be your area of expertise but I was trying to help out a friend on their site by making a numerology calculator that would calculate someones birthday, or life path number.  Birthday january 13, 1970. Lifepath is 113197013   134 so 4 is the number im looking for.  This is the formula I used ModModn,45,9, n[mathinput1].  And that works on every birthday except one that is supposed to end in 9 in which case it says the lifepath number is 0.  Any ideas One of our users bday is May 1, 1965 which is a 9 and it returns 0 as do all the combos i tried that equal 9.

Negative 1156 pI just got in JavaScript and noticed that lazy evaluation is not directly supported in this language. Natively the code turns into the hell of boiler plate like thisp  precodefunction lazyf      var v  undefined     return function          if v  undefined              v  f         return v         10 times larger than actual operation var foo  lazyfunction      return 3  3  codepre  pBut I found Sweet.js and believe that it can make the code simple like thisp  precodevar foo  lazy 3  3  var goo  lazy      var a  3  3     return a  codepre  pSo I tested out a hrefhttpsweetjs.orgbrowsereditor.html relnofollowEdit Sweet.jsap  precodefunction lazyff      var v  undefined     return function          if v  undefined              v  f         return v        macro lazy      rules  expr  gt          lazyffunction  return expr         var foo  lazy 3  3 codepre  pIt worked with a single expr. But there are cases that codelazycode takes in a block of expr like thisp  precodevar goo  lazy      var a  3  3     return a  codepre  pSo I arranged the above code like thisp  precodefunction lazyff      var v  undefined     return function          if v  undefined              v  f         return v        macro lazy      rule  expr  ...  gt               lazyffunction expr ...                                              rules  expr  gt          lazyffunction  return expr         var foo  lazy 3  3  var goo  lazy      var a  3  3     return a  codepre  pAnd it doesnt work for some reason. I believe the first pattern codeexpr  ...code shouldnt match with code3  3code, but apparently its doing. p  pI worked on this for an hour and finally gave up. How do you make the two patterns working at the same timep  pIf its not possible to do so, I would like to take another way for a single exprp  precodelar foo  3  3 var foocontent  foo codepre  pAnd I dont know how to do this as well.p

Negative 1156 pI am working on an outlook plugin which was created in VS 2008.It works well in outlook 2007.But when I open it in outlook 2013, it shows strange behavior. When I drag and drop a mail to a node, it uploads it to the server and the node is collapsed in outlook 2007. But in outlook 2013, it uploads the mail fine but first collapses the nodewhich is what Ive written in code and then automatically expands itwhich is not written by me ,changes the text of the node incorrectly e.g communications8 to communications88. Note that in code Ive written code so that numbers are not appended like communications89 but are only changed like communications89 changed e.g communications These nodes are of tree view control.And the oultlook automatically appends a number to parent node every time I upload a mail.Like I gave example of communications above.It is strange because there is no function in code regarding this functionality.Outlook does this by itself.p
Negative 1156 pIve been working on porting some existing game framework technology to Android and, consequently, Ive been working in OpenGL ES 2.0. I have set up a sprite batching class very similar to XNAs SpriteBatch. While the class works correctly when used with XNA, its producing odd results when used with my OpenGL framework. In short, its drawing the sprites in the right place and with the correct rotation, but whichever texture is drawn last is being used for every sprite.p  pSimply, if I instruct it to draw two instances of Texture A and then one instance of Texture B, then it will draw three instances of Texture B. If I reverse the order, it will draw three instances of Texture A. Whichever texture is sent last replaces the other textures. The obvious answer would be that I am replacing the texture in the required slot. However, I do not believe I am doing so though my knowledge of OpenGL is limited. In order to help diagnose the issue, I dispersed console output statements throughout my code base wherever a call to the OpenGL API was used excluding shader compilation, linking, etc. After running the code to a break point after the first frame, the output seems to suggest that the correct texture is assigned at each point.p  precodeGL Setting frontface direction to CCW.

GL Swapping Buffers. codepre  pThe log certainly seems to indicate that the correct texture was assigned at the time of each draw and attribute call. Unfortunately, this process touches on quite a lot of code. The texture, graphics, and sprite batching systems are clearly at the centre, but it also tangentially touches on the effect system. Ill try to avoid posting unnecessary code without removing anything that might prove important.p  pThe sprite renderer runs a setup before flushing. Any parameters that dont exist on the effect are ignored.p  precodeprivate void Setup      graphicsDevice.BlendState  blendState     graphicsDevice.SamplerState  samplerState      if effect.ApplyAfterParamters         effect.Apply0  Apply first pass if effect applied before parameters set.

Negative 1156 pLets say ive got 5 selects in an html form but you can only choose options from 3 of them. I need to accomplish the following 1. calculate a total price, 2. dynamically pass set variables that will eventually get passed to json for PHP equal to the name attr of the selected options. p  pThe problem im having is that im using value 1 on every option. Then defining the price which is updated each time they select another option by statically assigning the variable with an if else. In what im doing each select has many options to choose from.p  pWhere im stuck Either im going to use the name attribute and pass over 5 variables using optionselected or there is a way to accomplish this so my database only needs 3 columns to store to the database instead of 5. p  pI was hoping to accomplish this in the script on the page, rather than in the PHP. Can you do this dynamically and only send over 3 variables for JSON to pass off to the php or is this just going to be easier and faster to send over 5 Yes im very new to javascript and jquery p  precodeltform id  testform name  testform methodPOST actiontest.phpgt ltselect class  choose idchoice1gt   ltoption value0 selectedgtltoptiongt   ltoption value1gt Choice 1.altoptiongt ltselectgt  ltselect class  choose idchoice2gt     ltoption value0 selectedgtltoptiongt     ltoption value1gt Choice 1.bltoptiongt ltselectgt  ltselect class  choose idchoice3gt   ltoption value0 selectedgtltoptiongt   ltoption value1gt Choice 1.cltoptiongt ltselectgt  ltselect class  choose idchoice4gt   ltoption value0 selectedgtltoptiongt   ltoption value1gt Choice 1.dltoptiongt ltselectgt  ltselect class  choose idchoice5gt   ltoption value0 selectedgtltoptiongt   ltoption value1gt Choice 1.bltoptiongt ltselectgt  ltlabelgtlth4gtTotallth4gt ltinput style typenumber classnum nameamount value0.00 readonlyreadonly gtltlabelgt  ltscript typetextjavascriptgt select.changefunction     var form  this.form         var sum  0         var price            select selected.eachfunction          sum  Numberthis.val        if sum gt 3          alertYou can only choose 3 classes         select.choose.eachfunction              .choose.val0                       if sum  1     price  80      else if sum  2      price  130  else if sum  3      price  180   .num.valprice  form.elements[total]  price   codepre

It will then go back to the viewing table but if I searched again and ended up with 8 results if I edit it again it will throw p  blockquote   pException in thread AWTEventQueue0   java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException 8  8p blockquote  pand Im suspecting its because it cant find the currently selected combobox which was at row 9... so how do I deselect itp  pand uhm side question is there a way to synchronize the two tables because what Im doing is simply copying the values from one table to anotherp  pEDIT heres a sample of the problem but if its too much hassle to run Im just gonna provide a screenshot on how the problem is created...p  pa hrefhttpoi58.tinypic.com2qdap3s.jpg relnofollowhttpoi58.tinypic.com2qdap3s.jpga sorry Im new so I cant post pictures directly herep  precodepublic class TableClass extends JFrame        public TableClass          initComponents           SuppressWarningsunchecked                              private void initComponents           jScrollPane2  new JScrollPane         edittable  new JTable         remove  new JButton         edit  new JButton          setDefaultCloseOperationjavax.swing.WindowConstants.EXITONCLOSE          edittable.setModelDefaultTableModel             new Object [][]                  null, null, null, null,                 null, null, null, null,                 null, null, null, null,                 null, null, null, null             ,             new String []                  Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4                               jScrollPane2.setViewportViewedittable          remove.setTextRemove last row         remove.addActionListenernew ActionListener              public void actionPerformedActionEvent evt                  removeActionPerformedevt                                edit.setTextEdit         edit.addActionListenerActionListener              public void actionPerformedActionEvent evt                  editActionPerformedevt                                javax.swing.GroupLayout layout  new GroupLayoutgetContentPane         getContentPane.setLayoutlayout         layout.setHorizontalGroup             layout.createParallelGroupGroupLayout.Alignment.LEADING             .addGrouplayout.createSequentialGroup                 .addContainerGap                 .addComponentjScrollPane2, GroupLayout.PREFERREDSIZE, 375, GroupLayout.PREFERREDSIZE                 .addContainerGapGroupLayout.DEFAULTSIZE, Short.MAXVALUE             .addGroupGroupLayout.Alignment.TRAILING, layout.createSequentialGroup                 .addGap0, 0, Short.MAXVALUE                 .addComponentremove                 .addPreferredGapComponentPlacement.RELATED                 .addComponentedit                 .addGap109, 109, 109                  layout.setVerticalGroup             layout.createParallelGroupGroupLayout.Alignment.LEADING             .addGrouplayout.createSequentialGroup                 .addContainerGap                 .addComponentjScrollPane2, GroupLayout.PREFERREDSIZE, 95, GroupLayout.PREFERREDSIZE                 .addGap18, 18, 18                 .addGrouplayout.createParallelGroupGroupLayout.Alignment.BASELINE                     .addComponentedit                     .addComponentremove                 .addContainerGapGroupLayout.DEFAULTSIZE, Short.MAXVALUE                   pack                           private void editActionPerformedActionEvent evt                                                   TableColumn column  edittable.getColumnModel .getColumn  3           Im using a custom renderer from WebLAF          WebTableCellRenderer renderer  new WebTableCellRenderer          column.setCellRenderer  renderer          JComboBox comboBox  new JComboBox          comboBox.addItem  1          comboBox.addItem  2          comboBox.addItem  3          comboBox.addItem  4          column.setCellEditor  new WebDefaultCellEditor  comboBox                                                      private void removeActionPerformedActionEvent evt                                                   DefaultTableModel model  DefaultTableModeledittable.getModel          int rows  model.getRowCount         model.removeRowrows1                                                       public static void mainString args[]          java.awt.EventQueue.invokeLaternew Runnable              public void run                  new TableClass.setVisibletrue                                  private JTable edittable     private JButton remove     private JButton edit     private JScrollPane jScrollPane2   codepre

Negative 1156 pI am new to swift and am working my way through the Plymouth University lectures on Swift in iTunes U. They had us load 6 images into the media library, each sized specifically for a different orientation of iPhone and iPad. Under media, I drag in the first image, then under width select Any amp Compact which gives me 6 boxes. I follow the onscreen instructor exactly and place each image in the correct corresponding box. Then when I go back to storyboard and select the compact width and regular height orientation and drag the banner which correctly says I have 6 images stored it drags the largest image stored there. Even when I change the orientation to regular regular or any other variation, it always drags the same image and ignores the fact that I have specified which one should come. p  pWhat the heck is wrong here Should it not automatically pull the corresponding picture from banner based on the storyboard settingp  pEdit On Images.xcassets i have Width set to Any amp Compact per instructions  have the top row set to the three sizes for iPads, and bottom row set for three sizes of iPhone p  pOn main.storyboard, frame is set to compactregular.p

Negative 1156 pIve written two algorithms to find prime numbers. One  codeisPrimecode  is based on searching for odd divisors from 3 till the square root of the odd numbers to analyze the even numbers are discarded, the second  codeisPrime2code  is based on the assumption that all prime numbers greater than 3 have the form pk61 or pk61. These function consider the number 1 is a prime, but is easy to modify this behaviour if you think 1 is not a primep  pThe second algorithm is slightly faster than the first, but using tables they have at least the same speed.p  pUsing tables as the main, below, does the search becomes two times faster searching for the first million of primes than without using them.

Negative 1156 pI am at an intermediate level in Database  sqlite. Here is my understanding The search or reading mechanism becomes faster if we do indexing on the given field. However, in my case the field is the text  for example a long title of the movie. As far as I know, the indexing on text is expensive also it will need a lot of memory.  Since, I have an embedded system that runs sqlite, how can I make the select query faster for the text field. Is there any way to do so without indexing Note, I cannot convert the given strings to numbers.p  pThe use case is the following In STB, the user goes to a search filter option, the user starts typing the movie name, and the UI starts showing the movie name when the characters entered by the user exceeds 3. How can I optimize the DB to get the results  select query works fastp

Negative 1156 pI am using a hrefhttpninodezign.comcoolimagehovereffectwithpurecss3 relnofollowImage hover Effecta for a website. After a lot of search and spending long time in customization of that effect, I got the hover effect which I wanted. But that is not properly working on older version of internet explorer version such as IE8, IE7, IE6.p  pOn that website from which I referred has mentioned that these effects only work in modern browsers. Youll have to provide a suitable fallback if youd like to support for older browsers. p  pBut I dont know, what should I do to support that for older versions of IE.

Negative 1156 pI read many posts about the SurfaceView and how to integrate it in Android game and there is something that almost all the posts ignore.. The reason to use SurfaceView is to export all the graphics logic and screen rendering to different thread to achieve performances boost. But in all the posts that I read, the SurfaceView thread is also responsible for the logic and the game state updates, thus it seems like it takes the whole point of using SurfaceView. Even in posts that the logic unit is using a different thread, the updates methods and the rendering methods are called synchronically, and again, its seems like it makes the SurfaceView unnecessary.p  pYour help with example if possible would be appreciated.p

Negative 1156 pI have an MVC5 View where I am using the Grid.MVC component a hrefhttpsgridmvc.codeplex.com relnofollowhttpsgridmvc.codeplex.coma.

Negative 1156 pBackground If you seed your prng, it will print out the same random sequence. So, if I tell you that I used the seed 123 and I got 1, 5, 2, 4. Then, you can use the seed 123 and get 1, 5, 2, 4.p  pWhat I want to do in the most simple case... I make a web page that lets you enter a seed. Then, it shows you one random number and a next link. You click the next link and get the next random number. The problem is that the page accessed when clicking next has no relationship with the previous page. So, it is not based on the seed entered.p  pWhat Im trying to do, and I am obviously overlooking something, is to maintain the seed during the session. I can srand to seed the rand for the first random number. Then, I need to store the updated seed in the session so the next time the user shows up I can srand with the proper next seed. Is there an opposite to srand I dont want to seed the rand. I want to get the value required to make it start in the current state the next load.p

Negative 1156 pI am working on a JAXRS client application using resteasyclient 3.0.8Final which should read the text output streamed by a REST service and simply print it linebyline on the console. p  pA manual curl call to the service confirms that the output is streamed correctly, linebyline, as expected. However, when I try to read it from within the java client, it appears that I can only read and thus display from the input stream once the stream is closed and the call to the service has completed. In other words, if the service emits one line of output every second or so, instead of being able to display one line every second, I have to wait until the call to the service completes and then all lines are displayed at once.

Negative 1156 pIm trying to model a traitclass structure to a generic Data Access Layer using Slick, but to limit just on fundamental part Ill post a basic code that have the general idea of the problem.p  pSuppose I have a base trait that define the common attributes for a Entity.p  precodetrait Base    def id Option[Long]   def version Long   codepre  pNow Ill create the Entities based on that trait.p  precodecase class Userid Option[Long], version Long, name String, age Int extends Base codepre  pAnd a function that will get the Base type to be generic.

Negative 1156 pIm working on a SMSbased game Value Added Service, in which a question must be sent to each subscriber on a daily basis. There are over 500,000 subscribers and therefore performance is a key factor. Since each subscriber can be a difference state of the competition with different variables, database must be queried separately for each subscriber before sending a text message. To achieve the best performance Im using .Net Task Parallel Library TPL to spawn parallel threadpool threads and do as much async operations as possible in each thread to finally send texts asap.p  pBefore describing the actual problem there are some more information necessary to give about the code.p  pAt first there was no async operation in the code. I just scheduled some 500,000 tasks with the default task scheduler into the Threadpool and each task would work through the routines, blocking on all EF Entity Framework queries and sequentially finishing its job. It was good, but not fast enough. Then I changed all EF queries to Async, the outcome was superb in speed but there has been so many deadlocks and timeouts in SQL server that about a third of the subscribers never received a text After trying different solutions, I decided not to do too many Async Database operations while I have over 500,000 tasks running on a 24 core server with at least 24 concurrent threadpool threads I rolled back all the changes the Asycn ones expect for one web service call in each task which remained Async.p  pNow the weird casep  pIn my code, I have a boolean variable named isCrossSellActive. When the variable is set some more DB operations take place and an asycn webservice call will happen on which the thread awaits.

Negative 1156 pIm using strongVBAstrong in strongExcelstrong, and using the almighty Google to find functions, classes, methods for browsing HTML, string manipulation etc. but my question is actually for a possibly very general future usage.p  pUsually I find Microsoft documentation pages. Sometimes I figure out a way to use them, sometimes not. For example I found the function Filter a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryfat7fw0svvs.90.aspx relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibraryfat7fw0svvs.90.aspxa for string manipulation which seems to be for VB, not VB.NET however I have trouble running even the example code. I get a variable not defined error for CompareMethod constant.p  pI this specific situation I suspect I may need to add some references to my code in order for the compilator to recognize the symbols.p  pAs a different example I used the function Split a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarymicrosoft.visualbasic.strings.split.aspx relnofollowhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarymicrosoft.visualbasic.strings.split.aspxa, which seems to be for VB.NET, however it seems to work as intended in my VBA code.p  pstrongMy Questionstrong Can someone please not only explain to me what is happening here, but more importantly stir in the right direction by showing, where I can find VB functions and classes documented and their references explained in a way, that allows me to just add them in Excel VBA codep  pEDIT I like to emphasize that I see the emRequirementsem part of the description, however I doesnt help me much in Excel, since I can only access libraries through Tools  References, and the names there are quite different then the emnamespaceem, emmoduleem and emassemblyem names on Microsofts site.p

Negative 1156 pI started implementing a sample server in netty to support 100 continue. I got some confusion when I go thrugh the a hrefhttpwww.faqs.orgrfcsrfc2616.html relnofollowRCF2616a section 8.2.3. It says p  blockquote   pUpon receiving a request which includes an Expect requestheader           field with the 100continue expectation, an origin server MUST           either respond with 100 Continue status and continue to read           from the input stream, or respond with a final status code.
