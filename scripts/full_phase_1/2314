Positive 2314 pI have a JSON object codetblscode which contains an array called codesectionscode. This array contains titles codencode and IDs codeviewidcode of rooms that are also a part of the JSON object. This means you can do codetbls.[roomid]code and get the array that contains the objects of each room. I have a hard time making this work in Angular.p  pIt was built this way because it makes it easy to work with when it comes to UITableViews in iOS where its implemented and works. Therefore I cannot change the data. I tried below solution, but that gives me an error.

It then has one operation that is checked every time if codex  ycode. Since the WORST case is when the list is composed of identical elements, this check is always true  so the third and fourth operations codexycode, and list appending are always performed.

Positive 2314 pSo, I recently got into programming in python and decided to make a simple code which ran some simple maths e.g calculating the missing angle in a triangle and other simple things like that. After I made the program and a few others, I thought that maybe other people I know could use this so I decided to try and make this as simple as possible. The code can be found belowp  precodea  intinputWhats one of the angles b  intinputWhats the other angle in the triangle c  a  b d  180 f  int180  c printf codepre  pThe code itself does work but, the only problem is that if you have more than 1 question, it becomes tedious and a rather cumbersome task to constantly load up Python and hit F5 so, my idea was to have it loop an infinite number of times until you decided to close down the program. Every time I tried searching for a way to do this, all of the while True statements were for bigger and more complicated pieces of code and with this being maybe my fifth or tenth piece of code, I couldnt understand a few of the coding for it.p  pId appreciate any help or advice for this subject as itd make my day if anyones willing to help.p

Positive 2314 pI have been using OpenAL soft for Win32, and I I ran into a particular problem.  p  pMy goal is to play a looping sound that has a oneshot intro portion, similar to a .WAV file with a loop marker.  As I understand it, this must be achieved in OpenAL by using multiple buffers on a source.  In general, my approach is to queue up both buffers, then wait until the second buffer is playing, and set the source to loop.  This works, but the problem is that once I am ready to stop the sound, I dont seem to be able to unqueue the last buffer.  My code looks roughly like thisp  precode set up the sound alSourceQueueBufferssource, 1, ampbuffer1 alSourceQueueBufferssource, 1, ampbuffer2 alSourcePlaysource  ...   check to loop sound in update ALint buffer alGetSourceisource, ALBUFFER, ampbuffer if buffer  buffer2      alSourceisource, ALLOOPING, true   ..   check to stop sound in update if shouldStop      alSourceisource, ALLOOPING, false     alSourceStopsource      alSourceUnqueueBufferssource, 1, ampbuffer1     alSourceUnqueueBufferssource, 1, ampbuffer2  ALINVALIDOPERATION  codepre  pThe result seems to be that the buffer is not properly unqueued, and will be heard the next time I play this source.  I know that typically you can only unqueue a buffer after it finished playing, but I would think that I could freely unqueue any buffers on a stopped sound.  I am wondering if perhaps my use of the loop flag is causing this behavior  p  pId greatly appreciate any advice.p  pThank you, Mikep

Of course youre using a pipe and of course youre using stdin and stdout of the respective parts of the command. I had assumed that was too obvious to state.p  pWhat Im asking is how this is handledimplemented. Since both programs cannot run at once, how is data sent from stdin to stdout What happens if the first program generates data significantly faster than the second program Does the system just run the first command until either its terminated or its stdout buffer is full, and then move on to the next program, and so on in a loop until no more data is left to be processed or is there a more complicated mechanismp

Negative 2314 pI have a Form Compact Framework, actually with a few fields, a date and a string, among other things. Both TextBox controls are bound to properties in a BindindSource.p  pThe BindindSource has a DataSet as its DataSource property, and the DataMember is a table in a SQL CE database.p  pWhen I want to add a new row, I call bindingSource.AddNew, then bindingSource.MoveLast. The form shows the default values as defined in the DataSet and I can edit all the fields.p  pTo save the form, I call bindingSource.EndEdit and insert the values from the DataSet row into the database, using a TableAdapter method. The date makes it into the database, the string does not. Instead, the default value for the string is saved, not the value that I typed in the text box.p  pWhen I inspect the data in the DataSet tables row after calling EndEdit, the date field is updated with the data from the form, the string is not.p  pOddly enough, when I edit an existing row with the same form without calling AddNew, the string field is updated and persisted just fine. So this only happens after calling AddNew on the BindingSource. What am I missing Where should I start lookingp  pThe code is a bit too much to post here, unfortunately.p

Negative 2314 pThe topic has already been on the table in some previous questions. New elements come with new problems. I am seeking here for the best way to handle database connections, concerning aspects of  emmaintainabilityem, emperformanceem, emsecurityem and emimplementationem. I must mention that i am not interested in abstractions like Hibernate, Spring, etc at this time. Here are the facts  p  phr p  pScenario 1  Singleton patternp  phr p  p The main ideas here are  verify connection details, instantiate the connection, write a static getter for her and use it as long as needed. Code sample  p  precode  static Connection connection   private Statement stmt  null    connection  createConnection...   stmt  connection.createStatement codepre  pQueries will be executed using  p  precode  stmt.execute codepre  pNow, this may not sound too fancy, but..it works. I have total control over my connection, closing it, instantiating it, closing resultSetmust be done by every caller, etc.p  phr p  p Scenario 2  Singleton pattern with PreparedStatement p  phr p  pAs some people suggested here, ive introduced the PreparedStatement for executing the queries, and basically ive dropped the strongstmtstrong variable, and instead i use the expression p  precodePreparedStatement pStmt getConnection.prepareStatementquery pStmt.execute codepre  pUsing PMD code analyzer, ive noticed that strongpSmtstrong may fail to close, which is true, because i cannot close it here, and i cannot instruct the caller to close it either. This approach leads to the next scenario.p  phr p  p Scenario 3  Singleton pattern with static PreparedStatementp  phr p  pAll set, ive declared p  precodeprivate static PreparedStatement preparedStmt  null codepre  pMy executeQuery method adapts itself to p  precodesetPreparedStmtgetConnection.prepareStatementquery getPreparedStmt.execute codepre  pwhere the setter and getter are simply .. setters and getters, with public visibility and static attribute. This approach is easy to understand, and the callers will have to close the codePreparedStatementcode themselfs no problem, but closing codePreparedStatementcode will also close the codeResultSetcode, if the case. However, somehow i feel that reusing this precompiled statement is not all that safe with transactional aspect of the database. Are there any dangers herep  phr p  p Scenario 4  Using a Connection Poolp  phr p  pThis aspect needs further research, but i get the main idea. I cannot go into details about this practice, but there are few questions here also p  p4.1 I know that one can set the number of connections, the max size of the pool. What that number would be for a single user, for instance, resulting that i will multiply that number with the user count.p  pp4.2 Using a pool of connections, should i use the codeStatementcode or the codePreparedStatementcode when getting one connection from the pool and use it to execute some query p4.3 It is my understanding that using this strategy, i have to close the connection after his task is finished. But what if, for some reasons, the connection fail to close If that will, for some reason, repeat for a number of times equal to connection pool size..we are doomed. p OK, i will stop here, perhaps some updates will follow, depend on the answers to come. Manny thanks.p

Negative 2314 pI think Ds codestatic ifcode is an interesting language feature. That prompts my question Are there are other examples of compiled languages in which the compiler has a strong notion of the code and there are languages facilities to access themp  pFor example, this code provides something similar to codereprcode from Pythonp  precodechar[] reprTT value    static if istypeofvalue.repr   class T provides a repr method     return value.repr      else static if isTstring      return   value      ...other cases...    else      return toStringvalue     codepre  pI think this is cool is because it allows a different and more general approach to what overloading does, which is kind of an inside out way to make code more dynamic, compared to features like this. For example, the compiler knows how many fields my class has, but theres no way for my code to access that information at compile time in most languages.p  pCAVEAT That last paragraph had opinions in it, but I just mean to provide some motivation and clarification for my question, not elicit controversy.

Negative 2314 pI come from an MVC background Flex and Rails and love the ideas of code separation, reusability, encapsulation, etc.  It makes it easy to build things quickly and reuse components in other projects.  However, it has been very difficult to stick with the MVC principles when trying to build complex, statedriven, asynchronous, animated applications.p  pI am trying to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2083516bestpracticefortransitioningfromnestedstatetonestedstateseediagramcreate animated transitions between many nested views in an applicationa, and it got me thinking about whether or not I was misleading myself...  Can you apply principles from MVC to principles from Artificial Intelligence BehaviorTrees, Hierarchical State Machines, Nested States, like Games  Do those two disciplines play nicely togetherp  pIts very easy to keep the viewsgraphics ignorant of anything outside of themselves when things are static, like with an HTML CMS system or whatever.  But when you start adding complex statedriven transitions, it seems like everything needs to know about everything else, and the MVC almost gets in the way.  What do you thinkp  pUpdatep  pAn example.  Well right now I am working on a website in Flex.  I have come to the conclusion that in order to properly animate every nested element in the application, I have to think of them as AI Agents.  Each View, then, has its own Behavior Tree.  That is, it performs an emactionem shows and hides itself based on the emcontextem what the selected data is, etc..  In order to do that, I need a ViewController type thing, Im calling it a Presenter.  So I have a View the graphics laid out in MXML, a Presenter defining the animations and actions the View can take based on the state and nested states of the application, and a Presentation Model to present the data to the View through the presenter.  I also have Models for value objects and Controllers for handling URLs and database calls etc... all the normal statichtmllike MVC stuff.p  pFor a while there I was trying to figure out how to structure these agents such that they could respond to their surrounding context whats selected, etc..  It seemed like everything needed to be aware of everything else.  And then I read about a PathNavigation TableList for games and immediately thought they have a centrallystored table of all precalculated actions every agent can take.  So that got me wondering how they actually structure their code.p  pAll of the 3D video game stuff is a big secret, and a lot of it from what I see is done with a graphical UIeditor, like defining behavior trees.  So Im wondering if they use some sort of MVC to structure how their agents respond to the environment, and how they keep their code modular and encapsulated.p

Negative 2314 pI am building a very dynamic webbased application using a lot of Javascript to handle user events.

But when a column is not selected including the default load, I want the button disabled. The usability developer in me wanted to give the users subtle contextual clues as to what they can do to enable the button through the native rendering of the title attribute as a lightweight tooltip. I do this already in other areas of the application this is a crazy beast of a project and our usability tests have shown that the users are at least capable of recognizing that when the cursor changes to help that they can hover over the element and get some information about what is going on.p  pBut this is the first time Ive ever tried this with a form element. Apparently when I put disableddisabled in the element, it completely ignores the title attribute and will never display the tool tip.p  pNow, I know I have a few options at least the ones I could think ofp  ol liWrite my own custom tool tip plugin that is a little bit more robust.li liDont disable the element, but style it as disabled. This was the option I was leaning on the most in terms of ease to develop but I hate having to do this.li liLeave the button as enabled but dont process the click event. I dont like this option as much because I like to leave things natively styled as they should logically be. A disabled button feels the most correct and the look of a disabled button is instantly recognizable as a disabled button.li ol  pSo, with all that said, am I missing something Is there something easy that I can do that I just havent thought of Google searches have failed me on this topic, so I thought Id toss this out on StackOverflow to get some fresh eyes on this.p  pstrongEditstrong p  pI just found another StackOverflow question on this same topic, though that person used a very different set of terms describing his problem probably why I didnt find it.p  pThe url to the question is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2034820firefoxdoesnotshowtooltipsondisabledinputfieldshttpstackoverflow.comquestions2034820firefoxdoesnotshowtooltipsondisabledinputfieldsap  pBoth of the answers on that question are pretty good, though Id like to see if anyone has any other suggestions.

Negative 2314 pMy current application allows users to define custom web forms through a set of admin screens. its essentially an EAV type application.  As such, I cant hard code HTML or ASP.NET markup to render a given page.  Instead, the UI requests an instance of a Form object from the service layer, which in turn constructs one using a several RDMBS tables.  Form contains the kind of classes you would expect to see in such a context codeFormcode codeIEnumerableltFormSectionsgtcodecodeIEnumerableltFormFieldsgtcodep  pHeres what the service layer looks likep  precodepublic class MyFormService IFormService         public Form OpenFormint formId           construct and return a concrete implementation of Form           codepre  pEverything works splendidly for a while. The UI is none the wiser about what sectionsfields exist in a given form It happily renders the Form object it receives into a functional ASP.NET page. p  pA few weeks later, I get a new requirement from the business When viewing a noneditable i.e. readonly versions of a form, certain field values should be merged together and other contrivedcalculated fields should are added.  No problem I say. Simply amend my service class so that its methods are more explicitp  precodepublic class MyFormService IFormService         public Form  OpenFormForEditingint formId           construct and return a concrete implementation of Form                  public Form  OpenFormForViewingint formId           construct and a concrete implementation of Form             apply additional transformations to the form          codepre  pAgain everything works great and balance has been restored to the force.  The UI continues to be agnostic as to what is in the Form, and our separation of concerns is achieved. Only a few short weeks later, however, the business puts out a new requirement in certain scenarios, we should apply only emsomeem of the form transformations I referenced above.p  pAt this point, it feels like the explicit method approach has reached a dead end, unless I want to end up with an explosion of methods OpenFormViewingScenario1, OpenFormViewingScenario2, etc. Instead, I introduce another level of indirectionp  precodepublic interface IFormViewCreator         void CreateViewForm form   public class MyFormService IFormService         public Form  OpenFormForEditingint formId           construct and return a concrete implementation of Form                  public Form  OpenFormForViewingint formId, IFormViewCreator formViewCreator           construct a concrete implementation of Form             apply transformations to the dynamic field list            return formViewCreator.CreateViewform          codepre  pOn the surface, this seems like acceptable approach and yet there is a certain smell. Namely, the UI, which had been living in ignorant bliss about the implementation details of OpenFormForViewing, must possess knowledge of and create an instance of IFormViewCreator.  p  ol liMy questions are twofold Is there a better way to achieve the     composability Im after perhaps by     using an IoC container or a home     rolled factory to create the     concrete IFormViewCreatorli liDid I fundamentally screw up the     abstraction hereli ol

Negative 2314 pId like a streamlined methodology behind being able to run locally work is done on more than one machine, deploy, and commit to version control where the sensitive information up to and including password, username, ports, hostnames, database name are automatically absentor removed and imported based on which situation is happening p  pThe sensitive data was listed in order of importance so while password only solutions are nice, the farther up the chain the better. The other nice to have would be that theres a dummy sample file for someone else to try out the project on their own machine with their own host by just filling in the missing parts of the dummy file. p  pWhat are my options to follow for this functionality I thought about adding the relevant settings to the local machine.config, but then the information is saved out to the machine file instead of somewhere encrypted in my user documents file. Additionally that wouldnt lend itself very well to a local dummy file for newer programmers to plug and play. p  pWhat Im thinking is the cleanest solution is a local .config file in the project root that isnt added to version control.p  pIf theres a way to have it encrypted in such a way that the server machine is the only one with a key to decrypt the file rather than the project being able to do it that will be deployed that would be terrific. Then I could have the data stored in source control, share the source with other people interested in studying the project, without them getting the actual information needed to make breaking changes or look at private information.p

Negative 2314 pThe app Im building needs to show a shared custom UIToolbar for multiple views and their subviews within a UITabBarController framework.  The contents of the custom toolbar are the same across all the views.  Id like to be able to design the custom toolbar as a xib and handle UI events from its own controller class Im assuming I can subclass UIToolbar to do so.  That way I could define IBOutlet amp IBAction items, etc.  Then I could associate this custom toolbar with each of the UITabBarController views and their subviews.  But Im having trouble finding out whether thats possible  and if so, how to do it.p  pIn particular, I want to be able to push new views onto UINavigationController view stacks which are each associated with parent UITabBarController tabs.  So, to summarize, I want ap  ul licustom toolbarli lishared by multiple viewsli liwhich are managed by multiple navigation controllersli liand the navigation controllers are associated with different tabs of a parent tab bar controllerli ul  pThe tab bar controller itself is launched modally, though I dont believe thats relevant.p  pAnyway, the tab bar controller is working, as are its child navigation controllers.  Im just having a little trouble figuring out how to persist the shared toolbar to the various subviews.  Id settle for a good clean way of implementing programmatically... though Id prefer the flexibility of keeping the toolbars visual design in a xib.p  pAnyone have any suggestionsp

Negative 2314 pIve been pondering this question awhile now... many 3d engines support advanced terrain rendering using quadtrees, LOD... all the features you expect. But every engine Ive seen loads height data from heightmaps... grayscale bitmaps. I just cant understand how this is useful  each point in a heightmap can have one of 256 values. But what if you wanted to model Mt. Everest with detail of 1 meter, or even greater Thats far outside the range of 256. Of course I understand that you can implement your own terrain format to achieve this, but I just cant see why heightmaps are so widely used despite their great limitations.p

Negative 2314 pI have recently begun to develop a game in haXe which targets the Flash platform. I can say that Im not really used to Flash and how it works, it is really apparent that it was intended for animations. But anyway, now that game Im making is starting to be that big that it takes a few seconds for it to load that I want to have a nice preloader that makes a good impression while the user is waiting.p  pI found this a hrefhttpgamehaxe.com20090204haxepreloaderforflashwritteninhaxe relnofollow titlehaXe preloader for Flash  written in haXehaXe flash preloader written in haXea and it seemed like the perfect thing, but it is broken since haXe changed how its startup mechanism works  and I do not really know what it is doing so I do not know how to fix it either. It seemed to work at first but then it just stuck into some kind of loop and utilizing 100 of one CPUcore.p  pI also found this sort of a hrefhttpcreateivity.wordpress.com20100115haxepreloader relnofollow titlehaXe preloader  Createivityhalfpreloadera, it is only half in the sense that it only loads assets that is needed later. But in my game the assets is, as of now, a small fraction compared to the code, that means that there is still a few seconds of a grey square before the preloader shows up. I guesses that many might think that the game is broken and just leave if they do not see anything happen in 13 sec or maybe more.p  pI wounder if someone has a fully functional method that allows me to code preloader animation using haXe. Im also using swfmill, my coding station is an 10.04 64bit Ubuntu laptop if that is relevant.p

I initially attempted aliasing it as distance among the codeSELECTcode fields, but psql told me that this alias wasnt available in the codeWHEREcode clause. Fine. If theres some fancy pants way around this, Im all ears, but on to my main questionp  pstrongWhat Id like to do is to return a list of vendors, each joined with the closest of its locations, and have this list ordered by proximity and limited by radius.strongp  pSo supposing I have 2 vendors, each with two locations. I want a query that limits the radius such that only one of the four locations is within it to return that locations associated vendor alongside the vendor itself. If the radius encompassed all the locations, Id want vendor 1 presented with the closest between its locations and vendor 2 with the closest between its locations, ultimately ordering vendors 1 and 2 based on the proximity of their closest location.p  pIn MySQL, I managed to get the closest location in each vendors row by using codeGROUP BYcode and then codeMINdistancecode. But PostgreSQL seems to be stricter on the usage of codeGROUP BYcode.p  pId like to, if possible, avoid meddling with the codeSELECTcode clause. Id also like to, if possible reuse the codeWHEREcode and codeORDERcode parts of the above query. But these are by no means absolute requirements.p  pI have made hackneyed attempts at codeDISTINCT ONcode and codeGROUP BYcode, but these gave me a fair bit of trouble, mostly in terms of me missing mirrored statements elsewhere, which I wont elaborate in great detail on now.p  hr  h1Solutionh1  pI ended up adopting a solution based off a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4918098howtogroupresultsfromaquerybasedononetomanyassociationbysomecriter49182584918258OMG Ponies excellent answera.p  precodeSELECT vendors.

The purpose being, simply, that the custom class validator would be in the default group, so the business logic validating this class wouldnt have the details of this ugly legacy design leak into it by virtue of having to call the validation separately.p  pThoughts Thanksp

Negative 2314 pI need to detect scraping of info on my website. I tried detection based on behavior patterns, and it seems to be promising, although relatively computing heavy.p  pThe base is to collect request timestamps of certain client side and compare their behavior pattern with common pattern or precomputed pattern. p  pTo be more precise, I collect time intervals between requests into array, indexed by function of time p  precodei  integer lninterval  1  lnN  1  N  1 Y[i] X[i] for current client codepre  pwhere N is time count limit, intervals greater than N are dropped. Initially X and Y are filled with ones.p  pThen, after I got enough number of them in X and Y, its time to make decision. Criteria is parameter Cp  precodeC  sqrtsummX[i]normX  Y[i]normY2k codepre  pwhere X is certain client data, Y is common data, and norm is calibration function, and k is normalization coefficient, depending on type of norm. There are 3 typesp  ol licodenormX  summXcountX, k  2codeli licodenormX  sqrtsummX[i]2, k  2code li licodenormX  maxX[i], k is square root of number of nonempty elements Xcodeli ol  pC is in range 0..1, 0 means there is no behavior deviation and 1 is max deviation. p  palibration of type 1 is best for repeating requests, type 2 for repeating request with few intervals, type 3 for nonconstant request intervals.p  pWhat do you think Ill appreciate if youll try this on your services.p

Just codeboostcode and standard library headers scattered around.p  pThere is a hrefhttpwww.lenholgate.comblog200407fistlportprecompiledheaderswarninglevel4andpragmahdrstop.htmlan interesting approacha to this problem, but I cant quite figure out how to make this work. It seems that each source file must be compiled twice please correct me if Im wrong once with Yc and once with Yu. This adds burden on the developper which must manually tweak the build system.p  pI was hoping to find some automatically generate one precompiled header for each source file trick, or at least some best practices, but most people seem happy with including the world into codestdafx.hcode.p  pstrongWhat are the options available to me to use precompiled headers on a per source file basis strong I dont really care about build times as long as they dont skyrocket, I just want intellisense to work strongfaststrong.p

Negative 2314 pAfter developing for iOS for some time now, I have gotten comfortable with the language and am trying to get better at designing wellstructured applications. Initially my focus was on seeing something functional, so I ended up with gigantic view controllers which were horribly architected. Now, Im learning to separate my model classes and trying to keep my architecture more modular. I would greatly appreciate any advice on the following sample situationp  pI am developing an app which among other things pulls a list of articles from a server and displays them. However, the user has to be authenticated to be able to retrieve this list. Because other aspects of the application utilize the same authentication, I want a single class to manage the authentication. The goal is that when any controller requests data from the model which requires authentication, if the user is not authenticated, the authentication prompt will automatically be presented.p  pI expect to create the following  p  pVIEWbr  ArticlesViewbr  AuthenticationView  p  pCONTROLLERbr  ArticlesViewControllerbr  AuthenticationViewControllerbr  ArticleManager singletonbr  AuthenticationProvider singletonp  pMODELbr  Articlep  pWhen the application first loads, execution will reach the ArticlesViewControllers viewDidLoad method. In this method, I get a shared instance of the ArticleManager, specify the authentication class to be the authentication provider, and ask it for a list of recent articles. p  precode ArticlesViewController.m void viewDidLoad      ...     AuthenticationProvider authProvider  [AuthenticationProvider sharedInstance]     [[ArticleManager sharedInstance] setAuthenticationProviderauthProvider]     [[ArticleManager sharedInstance] fetchNewArticles]  codepre  pIf no authentication was necessary, the ArticleManager would successfully retrieve the list from the server and post a notification letting anyone interested know that the articles have been retrieved. The ArticlesViewController would handle this notificationp  precode ArticlesViewController.m  void handleNewArticlesNotificationNSNotification note      [self updateUI]  codepre  pHowever, if authentication is required, the user needs to be presented with a login screen before the articles can be fetched and displayed. So I imagine the ArticleManager doing something like thisp  precode ArticleManager.m  void fetchNewArticles      if [self.authenticationProvider isAuthenticated]           go fetch list from the web          else          [self.authenticationProvider presentAuthenticationRequest]       codepre  pNow, at this point I run into some difficulty fleshing out the remainder of the details. The AuthenticationProvider could present the AuthenticationViewController as a modal view controller from the AppDelegates windows rootViewController and AuthenticationProvider would be the delegate of AuthenticationViewController. The AuthenticationViewController would probably be dumb to the actual actions that it is taking, and would have its delegate AuthenticationProvider do the work to authenticate the user. Once the user is authenticated, AuthenticationProvider would dismiss the modal view controller AuthenticationViewController.p  pBut how does ArticleManager get notified that the authentication that it requested has completed It would need to be able to handle both successful and failed authentication attempts separately. A successful authentication would eventually result in fetchNewArticles being called again. p  pOne thought is for ArticleManager to be a delegate of AuthenticationProvider. This seems to work in this case, but there are other Model Managers which could also rely on AuthenticationProvider. Presumably this would be resolved if AuthenticationProvider is not a singleton. Would that be a decent design approachp  pThanks for taking the time to help me understand a good design approach. I have coded this a couple of times, but always get stuckconfused toward the end. Also, if the entire approach needs to be rearchitected, please feel free to point me in another direction.p  pMany thanksp

Negative 2314 pI have a session variable that changes some things about how a page looks. I have a button that changes the value of this session variable. But ... the onClick event happens after page load, so by the time I update the session variable based on the button click, its too late, the page has already been loaded.p  pTheoretically I could put all the logic about changing the display into a function and call it from page load, and then call it again from the onclick after the variable as been updated. But this is impractical there are many user controls that check the value, used on many different pages in different combinations. I would have to hardcode the list of user controls on each page, and if someone added a new user control to a particular page, theyd have to remember to update this function, which is lame.p  pIs there a way to force a page reload I can use response.redirect back to myself and it works. If all else fails I guess this is what Ill do. But it means an extra round trip to the server, which is clumsy.p  pIs there a way to process the onclick before the page loadp  pSome other magic solutionp

Negative 2314 pI have a clojure program that at some point executes a function called codedbrebuildfilestablecode.

Negative 2314 pFirst of all, let me clarify that I know you cannot have actual abstract classes in ObjectiveC. When I say abstract I mean I am not creating any instances of the class, but am simply using it as a base class for inheritance.p  pMy abstract class contains a NSInteger. All the classes inherited from this abstract class will need to use this integer. Once set, the NSInteger will be never be changed. The value of the NSInteger though will vary depend on the derived class. Since it will never be changed, I want to make the variable const. The thing is though, if I make it const, I would have to set the value upon instantiation. Therefore I would have to set the value in the base abstract class however then I cant adjust the value based on the derived class it exists it.p  pI realize this is hard to understand so I created some basic pseudocode. I used an NSString as an example, but in my program it is an NSIntegerp  precodeClass animal const NSString soundItMakes  Sound the constant integer since soundItMakes is const I have to set it upon instantiation even though it doesnt make sense in the base class  Class dog animal derives from animal. Needs to change the const soundItMakes to fit a dog however since it was already set in animal, the base class, I cant really change it  Class cat animal derives from animal. Needs to change the const soundItMakes to fit cat however since it was already set in animal, the base class, I cant really change it. codepre  pI do not want to remove the variable from the base class and instead put it in each derived class nor do I want to make it nonconstant. Does anyone see a solution to this I realise this is confusing so if any more information is required feel free to ask.p  pI am using Cocoa in Xcode 3.2.6 in Mac OS X Snowleopard.p

Negative 2314 pIm writing an app that stores the location of the places you have been throughout the day. Ive done a lot of research on CLLocationManager, and have been testing my app for the last 3 weeks. The locations I get with CLLocationManager sometimes is very inaccurate, sometimes 4 or 5 miles away from where I am.  I have a log in my test app and realized that every time I get a new location my DidUpdateToLocation method is called 3 times in a row, like within one second, and I get 3 different locations. One of them is always right, but the other 2 are off. Ive tested with it with different accuracieshundredMeters, nearestTenMeters, and Best, but still had the same problem. So, my first question isp  pIs there anyway I can find out which of these locations is the right one so I can store itp  pIve also realized that the users current location on the map view is always very accurate, so I thought about getting the users location from the mapViewblue dot instead of the CLLocationManager, but I learned that a mapView object will only return the current location if the map is actually on screen, and this is not the case since I want my app to run in the background. So the second question isp  pIs there anyway to get the users current location from a mapView without the map being on screen Or at least use the same technique the mapView uses for finding the current locationp  pIf you have any experience with mapKit and CLLocationManager, please share your thoughts.p  pThanks for you time. Any help is appreciated.p

Negative 2314 pAnalyzing Core Dump in retail build often requires to correlate the codeobjdumpcode of any specific module and the source. Normally correlating the assembly dump with the source becomes a pain if the function is quite involved.  Today I tried to create an codeassembly listingcode of one particular module with the compile option codeScode expecting I would see an interleaving source with assembly or some correlation. Unfortunately the listing was not friendly enough to correlate so I was wonderingp  ul liGiven a coredump from which I can determine the crash locationli licodeobjdumpcode of the failing module Assembly Listing by recompiling theli limodule with codeScode option.li ul  pIs it possible to do a onetoone correspondence with the sourcep  pAs an example I see the assembly listing as p  precode.LBE7923         .loc 2 4863 0         movq    rdi, r14         movl    esi, r12d         movl    696rsp, r15d         movq    704rsp, rbp .LBB7924         .loc 2 4880 0         testq   rdx, rdx         je      .L2680 .LVL2123         testl   ecx, ecx         jle     .L2680         movslq  ecx,rax         .loc 2 4882 0         testl   r15d, r15d         .loc 2 4880 0         leaq    rax,rax,4, rax         leaq    40rdx,rax,8, rdx         movq    rdx, 64rsp codepre  pbut could not understand how to interpret the labels like code.LVL2123code and directives like code.loc 2 4863 0codep  pstrongNotestrong As the answers depicted, reading through the assembly source and intuitively determining pattern based on symbols like function calls, branches, return statement is what I generally do. I am not denying that it doesnt work but when a function is quite involved, reading though pages of Assembly Listing is a pain and often you end up with listing that seldom match either because of functions getting inlined or optimizer have simply tossed the code as it pleased. I have a feeling seeing how efficiently codeValgrindcode handles optimized binaries and how in Windows WinDBG can handled optimized binaries, there is something I am missing. So I though I would start with the compiler output and use it to correlate. If my compiler is responsible for mangling the binary it would be the best person to say how to correlate with the source, but unfortunately that was least helpful and the code.loccode is really misleading.  Unfortunately I often have to read through unreproducible dumps across various platforms and the least time I spend is in debugging Windows Minidumps though WinDBG and considerable time in debugging Linux Coredumps. I though that may be I am not doing things correctly so I came up with this question.p

Negative 2314 pI am gaving a strange problem with a code.  The task is quite simple, from native code I call a java function, which gets a param from prefs, and returns to c, the method is with no params and returns a string. p  pEven stranger, it runs nicely on the first run, but the second time I call the whole native procedure from java when the c routine tries to contact the java method it crashes. which tells me its a memory corruption but I have no idea why it happens.p  pOk.

Negative 2314 pTo set the record straight, I am fairly new to C and most of my experience in programming is in Java. Im writing an array based stack implementation and I cannot seem to read any of the data saved in my stack. p  pObjects can be pushed and this seems to function normally. Commenting out the top operation yields a successful output of zero, which seems to tell me that I know the item is at least being added to the array. p  pHowever, reading the item, I get a segfault error. After a quick google or two, I learned that a segfault means that there is an operation accessing data it does not have access to. This leads me to think that my top function does not have access to the array. It is a private member of the class, but my previous knowledge of OOP tells me that a class method should have access to all private variables.p  pCould anyone help point me in the right direction here Apologies if the documentation is a bit excessive for such a primitive data structure, let me know if it should be removed.p  pThanks Code is belowp  precodeinclude ltiostreamgt using namespace std   Class arrayStack  A simple stack implemented with a single array.

Negative 2314 pUsing Magento CE 1.7, I have uploaded multiple csv files to create categories, create a lot of products, and assign the products to the correct category. I dont know when precisely it happened, but about two weeks ago I noticed that the category listings pages would stop showing the products on the frontend. I have spent nearly half of the development time for this project trying to get the category pages to consistently show the products.p  pToday I noticed that, again, the category pages no longer showed the products. Once again I logged into the admin section and double checked that the products were active, in stock, had qty and that the indexes were refreshed I have turned off caching so this was not an issue. When none of the usual fixes worked, I carried on to my original task of the day. I logged into the members area and did my tweaks there. It was then that I went back to the category pages and found that the products were back. By logging in and logging out I could make the category pages show  hide the products. I have been through the admin section looking for an option that may hide a product from a nonloggedin user but am unable to locate one.p  pWhy do my products not show when a user is not logged inp

Bad news is if we update the record with other status values before marking it Complete Hold, etc, then the first thanks for your submission email is sent again to the created by user.  As you can guess, they should only receive a total of two emails during the entire process.p  pCould this be because of the start option also being set to change, even though we specified the parameters for the change  Perhaps the two steps need to be defined as two separate workflows  It seems simple and specific enough that they can be contained in the same workflow.p  pAppreciate any feedback, thanks.p

Negative 2314 pI was wondering if it was possible to disable socket connection pooling in JAXWSp  pI am making calls to a webservice from within Jetty.  The webservice is designed to have at most two connections to the server at any given time.  One of the connections is a blocking connection thats used to do a pubsub poll with the server.  The other connection is used to make standard SOAP requests.  Once a connection polls, no other connections can be used to poll, or the server returns an error.p  pTo do this, I create two SOAP ports, one of which I use to poll and the other to make requests.  This works great until the poller returns some data and the SOAP request connection is sitting there idle.  When that happens, the next time I try to poll with the same SOAP port, it picks one of the connections out of the connection pool and reuses it.  If it happens to get the SOAP request connection, the server returns an error.  From that point on, the pollers dead in the water, since any new SOAP ports I create end up reusing one of those two connections, both of which have been deemed invalid for polling.p  pA possible solution would be to disable connection pooling, which means that each time I create a new SOAP port, it would establish a new connection.  Either that, or a way to get at the socket itself, which I could forcefully close.  p  pIt might also be worth mentioning that the connection to the server is a mutually authenticated SSL connection.p  pFYI, heres the spec for the server that Im trying to connect top  pa hrefhttpwww.trustedcomputinggroup.orgfilesresourcefiles93C23F2A1A4BB294D0A36CCD8A9E7BD3TNCIFMAPv20R047.pdf relnofollowhttpwww.trustedcomputinggroup.orgfilesresourcefiles93C23F2A1A4BB294D0A36CCD8A9E7BD3TNCIFMAPv20R047.pdfap  pAny help would be appreciated  Thanks, Marshallp

Negative 2314 pI have the following problem.  I need to compute the permutations of a set however, the set may contain two elements which are the same and therefore cause repeated permutations.  For examplep  pGiven the set code[ 0 0 1 2 ]code, the permutations include these possibilitiesp  precode 1     2     0     0  1     2     0     0 codepre  pHowever, I would like to avoid identical permutations such as these.

Negative 2314 pI have a JScript application which runs a HTA window to communicate with user. It starts HTA app with specific ID, then searches through shellWindows collection for the window with this ID and gets control on it.

When it does so, the createHTAWindow function doesnt work more cause it cant find the HTA window in shellWindows collection. If the script doesnt try to elevate its rights, then HTA part works fine.

Negative 2314 pI am new to web programming and need some expert advise. I am using SQL database for one of my website project. My website will display a list of topics with a Like and Dislike button. Logged in users will be able to click on the Like or dislike button for each topic. I am able to keep a count of likes and dislikes for each topics. So if a user clicks on a certain topic it will display the number of Likes and Dislikes for that particular topic, however what I am trying to achieve is when someone clicks on a particular Users profile it should display all the topics that user likes or dislikes.  For example when we click on a users profile in Facebook, it displays all the comments or Likes of that particular user, how do I do something similar to that. I would like to know the data structure to implement this and query the data Thank you all. Regards, Aaf.p

But I didnt find any post about ajax request from different js files. I have one module it works like facebooks notificatins in a simpler manner. When the page is loaded it sents the request every predefined seconds to control if the user has new offer from another. If it finds any it shows a message buble ower the notif button. when user clics the button it fires an other request to pull the offers in a list in opend little layer like facebook. I control the arrangemnt of request by making an global variable like ajax and initialize with a value of 1. If a request start then the 0 is assigned to the var ajax. if it returns success it returns 1 again an before every request it checks the value of var ajax to start. But Now I need to make an other module to refresh the content for every predefined seccond to bring the list of new contenbt form the database. Or in the component I need to mage the pagination via the ajax for inbox and outbox of user offers. How to control all of these. Without crashing.

Negative 2314 pam creating custom live tiles by updating the text in a 173x173 XAML control, then using writablebitmap.Render to create a JPEG.

But once in a while when a new tile is created, or deleted, the image is corrupted. The text is all mushed on the left side of the tile and there is no background color. Any ideas what could be happening Its not a background task as that is disabled. Something to do with the system scanning the newly created jpegs while Im trying to set the tile data thanks.p

When I first display that page an EditText at the top of the layout has the focus and the soft keyboard is covering the bottom 45 of the screenp  pI assumed that the keyboard was there because the EditText had the focus, so I decided to give a button at the bottom of my page the focus instead via . . . p  precode  butDone.setFocusableInTouchModetrue   bResult  butDone.requestFocus codepre  p... right after the emsetContentViewem.

Other than making them all links pointing back to the page  they are on Ive yet to find a way around it.p  pAnyone have any input Because this is really annoying and the whole reason I developed this application was so we could use it on our phones out in the field. p  pGoogle  StackOverflow Queries returned 0 useful results.p

Negative 2314 pIm hoping for advice on designing a workorder system that has to support recurring workorders. For example, An administrator needs to be able to set a workorder to repeat in a unit of time like every 6months.p  pIm using NodeJS as a server, a noSQL database couchDB for storage and elasticsearch as a search engine. Heres my first attempt at a document structure to support thisp  precodeBase Workorder     id 1    ... Unrelated fields    recurInValue  6,    recurInUnit  months    lastRecurredOn 1368914552527,    numOcurrences 1,    numTimesToRepeat null,    stopOn  1384920941195,    createdAt 1364936177618   Occurrence Workorder     id 2    ... Unrelated fields    recurFrom  1   Occurrence Workorder     id 3    ... Unrelated fields    recurFrom  1  codepre  pMy current CRUD plan isp  h2CREATEh2  pA cron job will poll the database hourly and get all of the workorders that have a nonempty recurInValue base workorders. It will then calculate the actual date of recurrence by adding the time given by recurInValue and recurInUnit to lastRecurredOn, if present, or createdAt, if not. moment.js works great for this. If the actual date of recurrence is lt now, the system will copy the workorder, set the recurFrom property to the base workorders ID, and update the appropriate fields.p  h2Readh2  pThis one is a little tricky as workorders have associated notes, activity log entries, and system log entries. These associated items all live in their own documents that have a workorderId property set to the parent workorders ID. Locating an individual workorders associated documents is trivial and is done by couchdb.p  pHowever, using notes as an example, the customer wants to see all of the notes from past workorders along with an occurrence workorders notes. Ive got this working by using ElasticSearch to find all of the workorderIDs that either share the same recurFrom value id of base workorder or that have an id that matches the workorders recurFrom property base workorder. The system then bulk fetches the corresponding notes in createdAt order chronological and passes them off to the view. p  pI havent worked out how to display everything though. A user could in theory add a note to a previous workorder emafterem the latest note on the one the user is viewing so displaying the notes in chronological order may be confusing. I might be able to get around this in the view by differentiating the current workorders notes from other notes by color or in separate sections, but Im not sure about that.p  h2Updateh2  pOne thing that seems tricky here is updating the recurInValue. If that changes, I think I would need to change the base workorder, not the occurrence workorder, so for example, if the user clears out the recurInValue the workorder will stop repeating.p  h2Deleteh2  pIm still a little fuzzy on this. If the user wants to delete an occurrence workorder, I can just delete it and its associated documents and ask them if they want to stop the workorder from repeating. If they say yes, I can clear out the base workorders recurInValue.p  pIf the user deletes a base workorder, repeating will obviously stop but all of the occurrence workorders will have a recurFrom property that points to a nonexistent document. If I leave the recurFrom property as is, I will be able to load all occurrence workorers associated documents and display them properly, but it doesnt feel right.p  h2Other Optionsh2  pIm not tied to this implementation, its just what Ive come up with so far. I considered a linked list implementation where each occurrence workorder would point back to the previous workorder, but it seems having to walk the list in a long chain of workorders and load each workorders associated documents individually would result in an excessive number of queries and not be very efficient.p  pAny advice you can give me is appreciatedp

Negative 2314 pI just upgraded to .NET 4.5 and I want to take advantage of the asynchronous method features. Specifically, I have a facade that makes 4 different api calls and aggregates the responses into a single response object which will be returned from my controller. Since these 4 calls arent related, they can be done asyncronously and execute in parallel. Ive seen examples of asynchronous controllers, but I want the parallel calls to occur within the facade class itself.

Negative 2314 pHere whats happening. I wish to store some data from multiple lists on Twitter. Each request return 20 array max, so if the list have more than 20 members you have to do multiple requests using the cursor attribute to get the next one. So i thought  infinite loop to call and parse the codejsoncode. p  pBasically what i want to do  call the first jsonwith cursor value set to 1 and stock the data. Then call the second codejsoncode with cursor value  to nextcursorstr value of the previous codejsoncode. Then call the third one... etc and stop if the loop if the nextcursorstr value  0 that mean its the last codejsoncode. That was my first draft p  precodevar interval  setIntervalfunctioni start the loop     if i1 var cursor  ampcursor1 else var cursor  ampcursorjson.nextcursorstr  set the value of cursor ine the request.

Negative 2314 pI have been struggling days to properly write the data from an audio buffer to a wave file... I have checked generating a sine wave to the wav file, and it works fine. However writing audio buffer data as Int16 to the wav file results in a constant high white noise. i.e. I can barely hear what I played on the instrument heavily distorted. Audio buffers are taken from ASIO input buffer using the ASIO SDK from steinberg.p  pThis is the function called when each input buffer is populated. Buffer size is 176 samples. I copy the buffers value from the address returned from it into a pointer called sound. This works without noise if i put in a sine wave in here without the buffersp  precode void bufferSwitchlong index, ASIOBool processNow         forint i0 ilt176 i      memcpysoundsoundcount,Int16 bi.buffers[index]i,2     soundcount          codepre  pThe wave header is as follows. The header works and plays fine with a sine wave.p  precodestrcpyWAVgtChunkID, RIFF WAVgtChunkSize  uint32tsize  8 strcpyWAVgtRIFFType, WAVE  strcpyFormatgtChunkID, fmt  FormatgtChunkSize  16 FormatgtCompressionCode  1 FormatgtChannels  1 FormatgtSampleRate  uint32t44100 FormatgtSigBitsPerSamp  16 FormatgtBlockAlign  2 FormatgtAvgBytesPerSec  FormatgtBlockAlign  44100  strcpyDatalgtChunkID, data DatalgtChunkSize  3  44100 2 sound  Int16 Datal  1 codepre  pThe sample type as specified by GetSampleType from ASIO SDK is 16 i.e. Int 16 LSB. Therefore I used Int16 as the data type for the samples. When the samples are printed using a printf it gives low values between 25 and 25 in each sample it is low since the values lie between 32767 and 32767 in a 16 bit pcm wav. I dont understand how the high noise is generated. However when analyzed through Audacity, the file has a lot of peaks as expected by the noise. Where am I going wrong and is endianess a issue in thisp  pEDIT Solvedp  pOkay I found the error. As I was saying the input and the buffers were flawless. It was an error in writing the data. I used fwrite earlier to write the bufferss which caused garbage bytes to be added to the file. Now I used the ofstream to write the data and it works like a magic. I think there is something wrong with fwrite method.p

The specific thing about this is that the page contains 3 forms which from only one is displayed depending of the dropdown list. Everything seems to be working perfectly apart from one thing. I cant submit the form because on the other 2 hidden forms there contain unfilled fields. How can I overcome this issue I think its a matter of adding to jquery a part which will ignore the hidden elements during validation process.

Negative 2314 pWell, I am very new and learning as I go here, so code has been added throughout this process and may be bloated and redundantly redundant.p  pI am trying to style my site so that everything remains centered in the page. I originally had this done and looking how I wanted but realized that everything was in a fluid layout. I want the information to remain fixed and simply have the background color extend fluidly to the right and left as needed for larger screens. p  pI have managed to adjust the header to a fixed layout into the center but now the white border will not extend out to either side to fill the rest of the header space. I was able to do this in a fluid layout but cannot figure out how to accomplish this now.p  pI am in the process of trying to convert the body and footer over as well. Currently the footer is coded following a sticky footer code I found while researching, however as mentioned above it was fluid and adjusting the browser size resulted my text moving when decreasing the size horizontally and the footer sliding in behind the body when changing the vertical size of the browser. I want to create a fixed, centered footer that remains at the bottom of the page with the black background extending out to the right and left fluidly to fill in the space.p  pThank you for any help you can provide.p  pHTMLp  precodeltdiv idpagegt  ltdiv idheadergt   ltdivgt   ltdiv idmaingt  ltdivgt  ltdiv idfootergt    ltdiv classfooterinfogt   ltulgt          ltligtltpgtltstronggtAddress ltstronggt ltbrgt  Streetltbrgt  City, state, zipltbrgt  phoneltpgtltligt          ltligtltpgtltstronggtAddress ltstronggt ltbrgt  Streetltbrgt  City, state, zipltbrgt  phoneltpgtltligt          ltligtltpgtltstronggtAddress ltstronggt ltbrgt  Streetltbrgt  City, state, zipltbrgt  phoneltpgtltligt          ltligtltpgt 2013ltpgtltligt       ltulgt   ltdivgt  ltdivgt ltdivgt lthtmlgt codepre  pCSSp  precodecharset utf8   header  font 1001.4 Open Sans, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sansserif backgroundcolor white margin 0 auto paddingtop10px paddingbottom10px color 7C0408 width1000px textaligncenter    body  font 1001.4 Open Sans, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sansserif backgroundcolor eae5e5 margin 0 padding 0 Height 100 color 000         BEGIN FOOTER        .footerinfo li  color white backgroundcolor black liststyletypenone margin 0 paddingleft10px displayinlineblock   .footerinfo linthchild4  fontsize 0.8em verticalalign250   footer  Position absolute Width 100 Bottom 0 Height 75px   This value is the height of your footer  font 751.4 Open Sans, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sansserif backgroundcolor black padding 10px 0px 12px 0px textaligncenter color white         END FOOTER        Html  Padding 0 Margin 0 Height 100    page  Minheight 100   for all other browsers  height 100   for IE  positionrelative    main  Paddingbottom 75px    This value is the height of your footer        Elementtag selectors   ul, ol, dl   padding 0 margin 0   h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p  margintop 0    paddingright 15px paddingleft 15px          miscellaneous floatclear classes   .fltrt    float right marginleft 8px  .fltlft   float left marginright 8px  .clearfloat   clearboth height0 fontsize 1px lineheight 0px  codepre

Negative 2314 pIm writing a CUDA program which will attempt to locate about 35 subimages, or patterns, within a base image.  Each subimage pattern can only exist in a small area say a 10x10 pixel window of the base image.  The subimages vary in size from 1000 to 10000 pixels.  The base image is 640x480 pixels.p  pI do this by convolving the subimage with a subsection of the base image and if the convolution result is smaller than a threshold, than that is considered a match.  I have to do about 100 convolutions per subimage since I only check a 10x10 window of allowable positions.p  pFirst question has this been implemented and is it available in Open Sourcep  pSecond question which is the better implementation strategyp  ol liCoarsegrained Each CUDA thread does a full convolution of the subimage within the base image.  There is one CUDA thread for each subimage and position.li liFinegrained each CUDA thread computes one component pixel of the convolution so, the CUDA thread multiples a pixel of the subimage by the appropriate pixel of the base image.  Then, use syncblock to sum these multiples.li ol  pUPDATE I trid both approaches.  I think the best method is a variant on method one where I divide the larger subimages into smaller subimages.  Now all the subimages are approximately the same size say, 1024 pixels.  Then each CUDA thread does a full convolution for a single position.  When done, I send all results to the host, and the host is responsible for putting the intermediate pieces back together for the subimages that were divided into smaller pieces.  The advantage is that all CUDA threads perform the same amount of work.  This seems to be twice as fast as the second approach, which is problematic since the subimages vary in size.p

Negative 2314 pI have been working on an app with the Windows Phone 8 SDK and Visual Studio 2012. I installed VS 2012 Update 3. After that, I started encountering a Silverlight 4 SDK not found error. I reinstalled VS 2012 and the Windows Phone 8 SDK which has apparently fixed that error. p  pI have a new problem now though. The WP8 emulator is not found anywhere on my system. The drop down in VS that shows all of the emulator target options is empty except for just Start. Choosing Start results in VS showing error HRESULT 0x89721500.p  pPlease help me if anyone of you solved this nasty problem. p

Negative 2314 pI have a design that needs what amounts to a UISplitViewController somewhere other than the root of the app.  Since thats illegal for some stupid reason thanks Apple, Ive had to recode certain aspects of it by hand.p  pThe table lays out properly in landscape mode, but when I move it into a popover, I get some odd issues.  Originally, I had the popover long enough that it had to shrink to provide room for the keyboard, with the result that the TableView was too large, and wound up clipped.  So I shrank the popover... and now the TableView is shrinking itself when I reload its data which I have to do when a user types in a search key.  Please note that the error only shows emafterem I reloadData the tableView and instead of clipping, now that its shrinking its band boxing at the top and bottom.p  pWhen I query against the frame data, the tableView oddly enough appears to maintain its height.  What that means I dont know.  If I dismiss the popover and represent it, it doesnt fix the issue I think the popover winds up being larger, but when I recall the keyboard it does popover shrinks back to the right height.  I dont want to try and do that as a fix because thatll just be annoying for a user whose actively typing.p  pEditp  pIf it matters, the only autolayout Ive applied is to the UITableView its been given a fixed width, and a height.  No X or Y data, which might have been a mistake, except I generate an error when I try to reference the superview  probably because the popover doesnt create a superview until I try to present itp  pEdit  Requested code Sorry its such a large and ugly blockp  precodevoidsetupViewsAfterRotation      if UIInterfaceOrientationIsPortrait[UIApplication sharedApplication].statusBarOrientation          [self.searchTable.view removeFromSuperview]         self.popover[[UIPopoverController alloc] initWithContentViewControllerself.searchTable]         self.navigationItem.leftItemsSupplementBackButtonYES         self.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItem[[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithTitleSearch                                                                                styleUIBarButtonItemStylePlain                                                                               targetself                                                                               actionselectorpresentPopover]         [self setupPortraitConstraints]         NSLogIntrinsic size data  width f and height f,self.searchTable.view.intrinsicContentSize.width, self.searchTable.view.intrinsicContentSize.height         NSLogRuntime size data  width f and height f,self.searchTable.view.frame.size.width, self.searchTable.view.frame.size.height       else          [self.popover dismissPopoverAnimatedNO]         self.popovernil         self.navigationItem.leftBarButtonItemnil         [self.view addSubviewself.searchTable.view]         [self setupLandscapeConstraints]        voidsetupLandscapeConstraints      if self.tableViewConstraints          [self.view removeConstraintsself.tableViewConstraints]         self.tableViewConstraintsnil          NSMutableArray landscapeConstraints[[NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormat[tableView256]                                                                                   options0                                                                                   metricsnil                                                                                     viewstableView self.searchTable.view] mutableCopy]      [landscapeConstraints addObjectsFromArray[NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormatV[topLayoutGuide][tableView]                                                                                       options0                                                                                       metricsnil                                                                                         viewstableView self.searchTable.view,                                                                                                 topLayoutGuide[self topLayoutGuide]                                                                                                 ]]     self.tableViewConstraintslandscapeConstraints     [self.view addConstraintsself.tableViewConstraints]   voidsetupPortraitConstraints      if self.tableViewConstraints          [self.view removeConstraintsself.tableViewConstraints]         self.tableViewConstraintsnil          NSMutableArray portraitConstraints     if self.keyboardHeight          NSLogHeight set to 612         portraitConstraints[[NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormatV[tableView612]                                                                      options0                                                                      metricsnil                                                                        viewstableView self.searchTable.view] mutableCopy]         [self.popover setPopoverContentSizeCGSizeMake256, 612 animatedYES]          else         NSLogHeight set to 768         portraitConstraints[[NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormatV[tableView768]                                                                      options0                                                                      metricsnil                                                                        viewstableView self.searchTable.view] mutableCopy]         [self.popover setPopoverContentSizeCGSizeMake256, 768 animatedYES]           [portraitConstraints addObjectsFromArray[NSLayoutConstraint constraintsWithVisualFormat[tableView256]                                                                                      options0                                                                                      metricsnil                                                                                        viewstableView self.searchTable.view]]     self.tableViewConstraintsportraitConstraints     [self.searchTable.view addConstraintsself.tableViewConstraints]  codepre

Negative 2314 pI found some javascript code on here that will display a session timeout warning and a message to inform the user that they have been logged out as shown below However my issue with this code is that if the user is not in front of the computer to click the ok button on either one of the alerts no further action is taken. So at the moment the timeout warning is set to be displayed 1 minute before the redirect, when that warning pops up the timer is halted until the user clicks the button and the second message pops up 1 minute after the user clicks the ok button then the redirect doesnt happen until the user clicks the button on that warning. The biggest of the issues here for me is that obviously the actual session timer is completely separate to these javascript timers so if the user is not in front of the screen when the first warning message pops up saying they have a minute before the session expires and that minute passes, then they see the message and click ok, they have not been redirected and will think they have one minute left but the session has already expired and I have code in each page the timer runs on so that they redirect to the index page if the timer has expired and all of the session variables stored are gone so they click on something and will be redirected anyway.p  pIs there a better way to do this Can I use the javascript to poll the session state and find out how much time is actually remaining rather than running a completely separated timerp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt      var iddleTimeoutWarning  null     var iddleTimeout  null      function pageLoad           if iddleTimeoutWarning  null             clearTimeoutiddleTimeoutWarning         if iddleTimeout  null             clearTimeoutiddleTimeout          var millisecTimeOutWarning  lt int.ParseSystem.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[SessionTimeoutWarning]  60  1000 gt         var millisecTimeOut  lt int.ParseSystem.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[SessionTimeout]  60  1000 gt          iddleTimeoutWarning  setTimeoutDisplayIddleWarning, millisecTimeOutWarning         iddleTimeout  setTimeoutTimeoutPage, millisecTimeOut           function DisplayIddleWarning          alertYour session will expire in one minute due to inactivity.           function TimeoutPage          alertYour session has expired due to inactivity.         location.replaceindex.aspx       ltscriptgt codepre  pThanks.p
Negative 2314 pI just came across some code which uses waitnotify construct to communicate with thread defined in a class, by its other membermethods.

Negative 2314 pI am creating a Java game within which the user can enter the commands of codeupcode, codeleftcode, coderightcode, or codedowncode to move the character in that location for a certain amount of pixels. Within the codePlayercode class I am receiveing the commands from the user in an codeArrayListcode of codeJTextFieldcodes after they have pressed the start button. I then use a codeforcode loop to go through all the inputs from the user and create codexcode and codeycode targets within a multidimensional array for the codexcode and codeycode amount of distance that the player needs to move. Finally I have a function called codeupdatePositioncode which is called within the main game loop. Within this function I loop through the multidimensional array of targets and have an codeifcode statement to check if the target has been reached or not. However when this method is executed and the user has input the commands of codeupcode and coderightcode for example, then the character moves diagonally up. I want a way which will move the character in the direction that the user has specified, executing them one after another.p  pHere is the codep  precodemoveSpeed  1 private double moveAmt  20 private Double[][] targetCoordinates  null private ArrayListltJTextFieldgt userInputTextFields  new ArrayListltJTextFieldgt codepre  pWith method below I acquire the codeArrayListcode of codeJTextFieldscode within which the user has entered the commands and store it in a local codeArrayListcode.

This array will be used to store the codexcode and codeycode targets for the character. I then lastly call the codemoveCharcode method which will set the target codexcode and codeycode. p  precodepublic void getInputTextArrayListltJTextFieldgt textFields     this.userInputTextFields  textFields     targetCoordinates  new Double[userInputTextFields.size][2]     moveChar  codepre  pThis method will check if the commands that the user has enetered and set the codexcode and codeycode targets within the codetargetCoordinatescode array.p  precode   private void moveChar         for int i  0 i lt userInputTextFields.size i               ifuserInputTextFields.geti.getText.equalsup                targetCoordinates[i][0]  x                targetCoordinates[i][1]  y  moveAmt               else ifuserInputTextFields.geti.getText.equalsdown                 targetCoordinates[i][0]  x                 targetCoordinates[i][1]  y  moveAmt               else ifuserInputTextFields.geti.getText.equalsleft                 targetCoordinates[i][0]  x  moveAmt                 targetCoordinates[i][1]  y                else ifuserInputTextFields.geti.getText.equalsright                 targetCoordinates[i][0]  x   moveAmt                 targetCoordinates[i][1]  y                      codepre  pp  pFinally, this is the method which gets called within the main game loop.

Negative 2314 pIn our current project, we implement persistent sessions by using cookies. When the user logs in a session hash is generated and sent via a user cookie.

Negative 2314 pI am trying to learn how to use the sds functions. I have the code sds.h and sds.c code files in my project folder and the little exploration program that i wrote compiles and runs just fine. However I am having a hard time understanding some of what I am seeing in the code from the sds.h and sds.c files. I cant tell why it compiles let alone works. p  pThe code in question isp  precodetypedef char sds  struct sdshdr    int len   int free   char buf[]   static inline sizet sdslenconst sds s    struct sdshdr sh  voidssizeofstruct sdshdr   return shgtlen  codepre  pThe sdslen function is called numerous times in the sds.c file and I can even use it in my own program after including the sds.h. I know that the typedef makes sds a type that is just a char pointer. The static keyword restricts the scope of the function. Inline means that the function will be pasted into the code by the compiler when it is called rather then using the stack and function call mechanisms.  It looks to me like the sh pointer in the sdslen function is assigned an address sizeofstruct sdshdr memory addresses before the address stored in s and then without initializing any of the variables in the struct the len member variable is passed back.  Any help in understanding this, what is really happening, would be appreciated. p

Negative 2314 pIm trying to create simple WebServices project using Intellij Idea 12 IDE Glassfish 4.0.0 server, JDK 1.7.045 And have a couple of troubles.p  pFirst of all, I cannot expose or unexpose my default class HelloWorld. I just do not have this button Expose Class as Web Service in menu Web Services or even in the tab tools. Somewhere Ive found that ALTENTER could help me, but it did not. There were no signs of that functionality too.p  pHowever, as you probably know, it is not extremely important in this test HelloWorld example to expose the class it is exposed by default and I still tried to launch my simple solution. But it does not work. It shows just blank window in browser path localhost8080jaxwsserver or smth like this. When I intentionally tried to change this path to string Ive changed it not only in browser urlstring, but also in Artifacts settings localhost8080servicesHelloWorld, which I have found in the configuration file sunjaxws.xml, It just shows 404 error in a browser.p  pI use this tutorial a hrefhttpwiki.jetbrains.netintellijDevelopingasimpleJaxWSWebService relnofollowhttpwiki.jetbrains.netintellijDevelopingasimpleJaxWSWebServiceap  pWhat can I do to solve this problems Thank you for every answerp

Negative 2314 pI have a script which has been written to allow multiple processes to be carried out concurrently.  In addition to running in parallel, these processes report their properties to the GUI in real time to allow the user to track the processes progress.  Also, I believe I have the system set up in order to allow the user to halt the process at any point in time, change the properties of that process, and then resume the process from where it was with the new properties.p  pHowever, it appears that the GUI is still not very responsive to the startingstopping of the processes and does not keep the changes in properties that are fed to it.p  pI have received some help on this script a hrefhttpcodereview.stackexchange.comquestions35876pausingandmanipulatingdatainaprocessusingmultiprocessingpipewithaguiherea, but it appears that the question was not appropriate for that forum.p  pThis is the code which I have at the moment, which I hope to change in order to achieve all of the goals I listed abovep  precodefrom PyQt4 import QtCore, QtGui

Negative 2314 pIve got some difficult for me problem with functions in C. Ive made some classes, like Numbers, Characters and so. Each class has a codevoid addcode function, but Numbers have codevoid addint vcode, Characters  codevoid addchar ccode, etc. In the main function, Ive got Numbers and other classes instances numbs, charcts and I would like to bind those with stdmap, so I will be able to call functions like thatp  precodefuncmap[numbers][add]12 codepre  pwhich will be the same asp  precodenumbs.add12 codepre  pBut itll be easier for me, if I could call methods by giving just their names as strings like show above.

Negative 2314 pI love jQueryUI, but the Tabs widget seems to be complicating things too much jQueryUI version 1.10.3.p  pI know it can load content on the fly and this is all wonderful, but I have here a emveryem simple structure with a form and some DataTables, more or less like thisp  precodeltdiv idMyContentgt   ltulgt     ltligtlta hrefFormgtMain Dataltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefSubTable1gtAdditional data 1ltagtltligt     ltligtlta hrefSubTable2gtAdditional data 2ltagtltligt   ltulgt   ltdiv idFormgt     ltformgt...ltformgt   ltdivgt   ltdiv idSubTable1gt     DataTables 1 goes here   ltdivgt   ltdiv idSubTable2gt     DataTables 2 goes here   ltdivgt ltdivgt codepre  pHowever, things break horribly when I apply jQueryUI Tabs to this. One reason I already know is the use of codeltbasegtcode tag in my code, which makes Tabs think I want to load my content on the fly, instead of simply hidingshowing content already there. But even using a hack to fix this, DataTables doesnt render correctly.p  pAnd frankly, I dont want to spend days trying to figure it all out to find a fix.p  pInstead, I would like to know if there is a way to switch off all the fanciness of JqueryUI Tabs, and make it just hide and show my tabs, using whatever is inside each div. Is it possiblep  pThat would solve my problem. If I manually create some buttons and associate a click event that simply do a codedisplay nonecode  codedisplay blockcode to my divs, they work like a charm, including DataTables.p  pIn fact, Im considering dumping jQueryUI Tabs completely and creating the necessary code to do just that, but I would prefer to use jQueryUI Tabs, if possible.p  pThanks a lot in advancep

Negative 2314 pI have implemented log4j in my web application project. Project is done using net beans,using  tomcat 7.0.41. At first,I created log4j.property file and placed under web pageWebINFclasseslog4j.properties in net beans and it asks me to locate the file in my project,so I manually located that file to implement log4j in my application. After that I changed the place of the log4j.properties file to myprojectbuildwebWEBINFclasseslog4j.properties in location of my project saved, now its working fine, it did not ask me to manually locate the property file, It takes automatically when my class files executed. Now my problem is that once I committed the project and again checkout the project on some day, property file does not appear and it again ask for property file. So where can I create the log4j property file in my project so that my team mates can utilize it when they checkout project in their system.p

Negative 2314 pIm using Vagrant to run a mock of my production server, and trying to deploy to it via Capistrano 3. Because vagrant is forcing me to use port 2222, I added it to the server in my test.rb stage file. When I run codecap test deploycode, it prompts for the password and runs nearly everything, but when it gets to moving the precompiled assets to the Vagrant box it seems that it isnt using the port on the server. It prompts for my password again and after entering the correct one three times, it craps out every time. a hrefhttpsgist.github.comDevanB8403955 relnofollowHere is a gista of the log, my test.rb and deploy.rb.

Negative 2314 pI want start programming my first browser based web application. Since it will be my first one I have only few knowledge of the necessary languages and frameworks.p  pThe application should provide a modern interface with a proper designed skin including basic animations and its main purpose will be to provide MySQL database based data analysis to a nontechnical audience. It must also provide graphsdiagrams to visualize the numbers. I want to target bigscreen devices but it should also be possible to access the application by common mobile devices. However since this hopefully will not be my the last application, the selected languages and frameworks should support implementing a big variety of browser based webapplications.p  pMy first decision is to select the server side andor client side frameworks and languages. I think this is very important since I will have to invest a lot of worktime into this project and I would really like to avoid ending up starting from the scratch because I selected the wrong techniques.p  pCurrently I am not totally aware to which degree I would like the application to be executed on the client side or on the server side. But I suppose this depends from the selected frameworks and languages. My current intension is to run the application mainly on the server side at least the algorithms and application logic. I want to avoid browserplugins like Flash and Silverlight.p  pThe server to be used for the application currently runs mainly PHP applications especially Wordpress hosted in LinuxApache. So languagesframeworks that run on LinuxApache would be an advantage because they are easier to integrate into the existing site. However I also have an Microsoft IIS available which would probably need iframes to integrate the application into the existing WP website.p  pTo me more important than the webserver is that the languagesframeworks are modern and fully object oriented I am a C programmer and I would like to avoid the pain of losing OOP. They should provide a big variety of components and should actively support secure programming on the server side. I also would like to have a modern IDE that holds my hand while learning and developing if it doesnt cost a fortune. And it shouldnt be too new or exotic so I can easily find code examples, tutorials, documentation and forum help in the web.p  pMaybe someone can give me some advice which technologies I should investigate first.p

Now I know that its using at least 4 threads because I see the processor load on each of my cores. But even with shared memory I can understand why processes might take a while, due to memory copying, I feel that this disparity in runtime is far too huge.p  pDoes anyone have any ideas as to why this might take so long It seems that a simple squaring operation, which is indeed highly parallelizable, should really not take so long.

Negative 2314 pI have two projects on my git repo server. The first one is a library I wrote, lets call it codefoolibbarcode. The second is an application which uses that library codefooappbarcode.

Negative 2314 pI have an SQL Azure database, and one of the tables contains over 400k objects. One of the columns in this table is a count of the number of times that the object has been downloaded.p  pI have several queries that include this particular column call it codetimesdownloadedcode, sorted descending, in order to find the results.p  pHeres an example query in LINQ to SQL Im writing all this in C .NETp  precodevar query  from t in db.tablename     where t.textcolumn.StartsWithsearchfield     orderby t.timesdownloaded descending     select t.textcolumn   grab the first 5 var items  query.Take5 codepre  pThis query called perhaps 90 times per minute on average.p  pObjects are downloaded perhaps 10 times per minute on average, so this codetimesdownloadedcode column is updated that frequently.p  pAs you can imagine, any index involving the codetimesdownloadedcode column gets over 30 fragmented in a matter of hours. I have implemented an index maintenance plan that checks and rebuilds these indexes when necessary every few hours. This helps, but of course adds spikes in query response times whenever the indexes are rebuilt which I would like to avoid or minimize.p  pI have tried a variety of indexing schemes.p  pThe best performing indexes are covering indexes that include both the codetextcolumncode and codetimesdownloadedcode columns. When these indexes are rebuilt, the queries are amazingly quick of course.p  pHowever, these indexes fragment badly and I end up with pretty frequent delay spikes due to rebuilding indexes and other factors that I dont understand.p  pI have also tried simply not indexing the codetimesdownloadedcode column. This seems to perform more consistently overall, though slower of course. And when I check on the SQL query execution plan, it seems to be pretty inconsistent in how SQL tries to optimize this query. Of course it ends up with a log of logical reads as it has to fetch the codetimesdownloadedcode column from the table and not an organized index. So this isnt optimal.p  pWhat Im trying to figure out is if I am fundamentally missing something in how I have configured or manage this database.p  pIm no SQL expert, and Ive yet to find a good answer for how to do this.p  pIve seen some suggestions that Stored Procedures could help, but I dont understand why and havent tried to get those going with LINQ just yet.p  pAs commented below, I have considered caching but havent taken that step yet either.p  pFor some context, this query is a part of a search suggestion feature. So it is called frequently with many different search terms.p  pAny suggestions would be appreciatedp

Negative 2314 pI want to give the opportunity for a user of an app to registerlogin with Facebook or by creating an account. I know that I can get the users Facebook account email address, and their first and last names. Thats basically the only information for creating a local app account, apart from a password. How can I make sure that if that person logs in to Facebook on another device, that their two devices are linked to the same local account i.e if they choose to sign in with Facebook with 2 devices, I only want one local account to be created on my server for that user.p  pIdeally, I want the login schemes for both to be identical. So if that user logs in with Facebook, I can check securely that the FB account is linked to a local account, and automatically log that device in without making the user type in a password. Is this possiblep  pEdit The local users will be stored in a database on my server, and the front end will be done in Python running alongside the API for the app. Note that local is just referring to the fact that it uses my app web service rather than an external social network.p

Negative 2314 pId like to make a function reading integers from codestdincode in the fastest way possible. To be more specific Ive got a very long sequence of codeintcodes separated with spaces finished with codeEOFcode on which Ive got to make some operations. I used codecincode but since this function is quite robust in its possibilites Id like to make something smaller, more specific, and thus, faster and more efficient. Ive read that the fastes way of reading codestdincode is codegetCharcode function. Ive already found some implementations of this problem in C, but chars there are just another form of integers and in C theyre not. My idea is to make a function of type codeboolcodep  pcodebool myIntRead int numcodep  pwhich would basically read chars of an integer until a space sign and somehow put these chars back into an codeintcode number. The codeboolcode type would be used to inform that the codestdincode is empty. p  precodeint main      int num     while myIntReadampnum           myIntReadampnum         some operations on num       codepre  pIm fully aware that this sort of dealing with input is much more complex and more difficult but Id really like to find out a solution to this problem. I will really appreaciate some help from You Guys in finding out an implementation of this concept. Best regardsp

Negative 2314 pIm the maintainer of a public project on github and npm. When I created the project it solved my particular requirements better than available alternatives. However, the community has caught up and surpassed my solution. I dont even use the tool I created any more, and Im not interested in maintaining it. I updated the README to this effect, but Im still getting pull requests. Should I simply take it down Is this considered rude given others are forking it and trying to contribute So far Ive had no luck getting these others to accept responsibility as its maintainers.p  pIm not looking for arbitrary subjective opinions, rather evidence of some kind of consensus  perhaps in the form of documentation or a howto from a recognized authority.

Negative 2314 pThe way stock.picking.in is implemented in openERP is interesting. I am trying to do something similar with purchase orders.p  pStock.picking.in inherits from stock.picking, customizes a few columns and defaults and declares the table as stockpicking.

Negative 2314 pI would like to find out a good way to go about implementing a jobs queue using strongpostgresstrong and strongPDOstrong php. p  pBasically I have an codeeventscode table where the apps events are logged and some form of scheduled processor say codeproccode that will regularly take care of retrieving an event at a time and execute certain routines in response to it and depending on the nature of the event it self.p  pClearly, as soon as an instance of codeproccode starts working on an event, I need to mark the row as codeongoingcode, like thatp  precodeUPDATE events SET status  ongoing WHERE id  3  gtgt QUERY 1 ltlt codepre  pFine codeproccode can now do its business according to the type of event and its payload and no other thread will deal with the event of id  3 as it is now codeongoingcode.p  pWhen codeproccode is done with event 3 it marks it as resolved so that, again, no other thread will, in the future, take care of event 3. Here we gop  precodeUPDATE events SET status  resolved WHERE id  3  gtgt QUERY 2 ltlt codepre  pNow my concern is that this must be done inside a transaction, so I would havep  precodeBEGIN   QUERY 1  VARIOUS OTHER QUERIES TAKING A LOT OF TIME  QUERY 2 COMMIT codepre  pAs far as I know, when inside a transaction, the change operated by QUERY 1 is only visible to other threads when the whole transaction is committed. That implies that while codeproccode instance 1 is doing the time consuming work the code between QUERY 1 and QUERY 2 some other instance of it might read the codeeventscode table and think that no one is taking care of event 3 and move on doing stuff with it. Clearly that would mess up the whole thing and corrupt the state of the queue. p  pstrongSo my question isstrong how do I preserve the transactional style of codeproccode and, at the same time, make the change of state of event 3 from codefreecode to codeongoingcode strongimmediatelystrong visible from outside the transactionp
Negative 2314 pI want to create a build server for my Android Application. I am working with TeamCity. My problem isp  ol liBuild server which is a PC Windows doesnt see Android SDK location.li liPC on which server runs has ANDROIDHOME set in right way.li liMy application uses Gradle build system.li ol  pWhat I need to do is to make my build server use environment location ANDROIDHOME during build of my app. What have I already triedp  ul liI used local.properties in my Android Project. I tried to set ANDROIDHOME parameter to sdk.dir in various ways for example.li ul  blockquote   psdk.dir  ANDROIDHOMEp blockquote  presult  errorp  blockquote   pThe SDK directory ETeamCitybuildAgentworka6d423a9d6e29c40ANDROIDHOME does not exist.p blockquote  pSo as you can see, server adds some strange directory before. Same goes for ANDROIDHOME or ANDROIDHOME.p  ul liWhen I set path manually and point to SDK direction on server soli ul  blockquote   psdk.dir  Program Files x86androidstudiosdkp blockquote  pThen server builds the project and everything is right. ANDROIDHOME environment variable is set to same location as this.p  ul liI deleted local.properties and I get thisli ul  blockquote   pSDK location not found. Define location with sdk.dir in the local.properties file or with an ANDROIDHOME environment variable.p blockquote  pSo how I understand this is if I wont have local.properties in my project it will look for SDK path in ANDROIDHOME environment variable. Like I said, on my server environment variable is set and Ive checked it many times. It doesnt work. I tried it also on MAC X OS, terminal displays ANDROIDHOME as ApplicationsAndroid Studio.appsdk but for example Android Studio is able to build project only if I hardcode path in local.properties. It doesnt want to accept ANDROIDHOME variable in any way.p  hr  pHow can I set environment variable in local.properties so I dont have to hardcode it to make it workp
Negative 2314 pIm trying to wrap my head around where the code executes from, as this is what I want to achievep  pI have a main window codewinMainWindowcode with a toolbar at the top. Each item in the toolbar codeFile gt Add New Companycode will open a new window, which will ideally be selfcontained, do some processing, and then be closed.p  pEvery time I add a new window to the project rightclick on codesolution gt Add gt Windowcode, it creates a code.xamlcode and code.xaml.cscode file for the new window. Say I create a new window called codeSettingsWindowcode I understand how to use the codeSettingsWindow.xamlcode file, thats selfexplanatory.p  pHowever, with the code.xaml.cscode file that it creates for each window, what is supposed to go in there I cant seem to figure out when that code will be executed  I havent been able to find the Main method yet, so there must be a reason thats hidden.p  pIt would make sense to have the codeSettingsWindowcode methods in the codeSettingsWindow.xaml.cscode file, but how to I get the program to switch to that code.cscode file when the codeSettingsWindowcode has been openedp  pLastly, if I wanted to write a method called codeOpenThisWindowcode, which I want to be able to use for all my windows, where would I write this method I believe it should be a codepubliccode method, but I dont know where to place the code.p  pThank you.p

I had some idea to utilize JIT and remove some instructions at runtime code.p  pHere is sample code i triedp  precode   Created by kadirbasol on 4614.   public class RemoveJump      public final boolean test      private static RemoveJump instance  new RemoveJump      public static final RemoveJump getInstance          return instance           private RemoveJump          set the test on the constructor once and         remove this if statement forever from testLoop         test  false            public final long getData          return 1000000000           public final void testLoop          long l  System.currentTimeMillis         int ppp  0         long count  System.currentTimeMillis         final long data  getData         this loop should be removed from function because         RemoveJump set test to false and modified testLoop function         for int i  0 i lt  data  i              iftest                  ppp                          iftest                  ppp                          iftest                  ppp                          iftest                  ppp                          iftest                  ppp                               long lastTime  System.currentTimeMillis  l         System.out.printlnlastTime         System.out.printlnppp           public static void mainString[] args          RemoveJump.getInstance.testLoop       codepre  pthere are 5 if statement on the code. Is it possible to remove these 5 check if statements at function  The constructor will set final boolean variable once and remove the jump. Constructor will modify the testLoop function.p  pBut the code i tried has no effect. JIT is not modifying code  why  if not , can we modify JVM function on the constructor i heard about a hrefhttpasm.ow2.org relnofollowhttpasm.ow2.orga , asm java library for generating or modifying JVM.p

Negative 2314 pSo i made this program to scan for an address and then ask the uesr if they want o insert another one or print the ones already inserted. When i run it i goes through it once then what ever i insert for ampy it prints a random number then prints the line with the comment in it again and scans for ampy. I feel like its skipping the fgets function the second time through the dowhile loop.

Negative 2314 pIm having my first real introduction to injecting pv a hrefhttpwww.ivarch.comprogramspv.shtml relnofollowPipe Viewera in bash for some user feedback. Ive also tried to search the other posts regarding PV and havent found what I needed. It is likely a simply answer that others will hopefully find useful ...p  pMy goal is to transfer a large network file then decompress in this case tarp  pThe network folder has been mounted for convenience.  Im able top  precodepv rootnetworksharesomeFile.tar gt tmpsomeFile.tar codepre  pthenp  precodepv someFile.tar  tar xf  codepre  pSo Im trying to pipe chain them and just cant seem to get it correct. I believe Im close withp  precodepv cN transfer rootnetworksharesomeFile.tar gt tmpsomeFile.tar  pv cN untar tar xf   codepre  pJust an FWIW, if I create a dependent instruction it does work, Im really trying to understand more of the piping construct. For example provided the network transfer is successful, the following will produce the desired resultp  precodepv cN transfer rootnetworksharesomeFile.tar gt tmpsomeFile.tar ampamp pv cN untar tmpsomeFile.tar  tar xf   codepre  pId appreciate that final nudge and what Im missing.

Negative 2314 pI am loading a very big testing database into MYSQL I have a script running to load all the tables. I think the loading process is going to take a few days so I am trying to determine which tables have been completely loaded and also make sure every tuple is correctly stored. I have many tables so I do not want to do a count for each table one by one I was wondering if there is a function to display all the tables in my database with a summary of the information about them ie number of rows. So far,I have found the function SHOW TABLES but this does not show any information about the tables.  Please let me know if there is a way to obtain this information without having to run queries for every table. Thanksp

Negative 2314 pOkay so Im starting to make a main menu for a small flash game and to do this I want to use the mouse to click on buttons etc. I have a button class in which I create two rectangles a rectangle for the button and a rectangle for the mouse based on its X and Y, 1 pixel by 1 pixel. I use Rectangle.Intersects to check if they are touching before seeing if left mouse button is down. Problem is, the thing the mouse position is relative to changes every time so no matter where the mouse button is on the screen, its never the same coordinates as in a different build in that exact same position.

I dont want to have to rely on hackish keypress simulations if possible, but for questions sake, heres what I did try doesnt workp  precodedptsearch.autocomplete       lookup dpts,       minLength 0,       onSelect function suggestion            dptsearch.triggerkeypress         codepre  pSo basically,p  p1.

Negative 2314 pComparing case insensitive strings with linq is quite easy, even to find out if a specific string is within another. The problems only start when it is also needed as in my case to differentate between ss and . As far as I have seen linq and string offer only 1 viable option there Contains but the problem is the only contains overload that takes for example StringComparer.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase as parameter does not take string as parameter for the part that is searched within the calling string but instead takes ONLY a char value.p  pAs it was asked Im using linq to gather info from a SQL database thusp  precodevar results  from c in myEntity.myTablename where  c.MyStringTextColumn.ContainsmyStringTextToCompareWith  select c.MyStringTextColumn.Distinct.ToList codepre  pis how Im comparing the strings originally but like I said the problem is this does not differentiate between ss and . Thus in the database there are different versions in regards to ss and  stored, and I need to only find the correct one. Even though they are essentially the same one, an example would be strasse and strae as names are stored in the database I couldnt use them in this example. If I type in strass I only want to find those strings that contain ss and not those with  thus strae should not be foundp  pSo my question is What options exist therep

Negative 2314 pImagine you are going to have a lot of long processor intensive tasks of translating some strings into something else. You are going to want to have a pool of actual threads to keep the main node thread going and to make use of your cores.p  pThe main way to do this is to either implement a hrefhttpsgithub.comxknodethreadsagogo relnofollowThreadsagogoa or a hrefhttpsgithub.comxknodethreadsagogo relnofollowWebworkerThreadsa, and start a pool of 16 threads e.g. on a Intel with 8 cores you usually have 16 threads concurrently.p  pDoing a request to a thread is called an event or a message. Getting a response is also catching an event or getting a message. But how does this work with a threadPoolp  pIf you skip the Webworker API, TAGG and Webworkers for node have the same underlying API. You can load your translation function in all workers using codethreadPool.loadcode and que a task to one of them using codethreadPool.anycode.p  pBut imagine I now have 50 tasks strings to translate to be queued. The codethreadPoolcode will eventually emit 50 events responses with a translated string without telling me what task the response belongs top  pI think I am fundamentally misunderstanding one thing about the threadPool.p  pIs there a way I can just add a task to the threadPool queue and receive a callback when strongthat particular taskstrong is donep

This is used when creating  redirection URLs. In the context of virtual hosts, the ServerName  specifies what hostname must appear in the requests Host header to  match this virtual host. For the default virtual host this file this  value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.  However, you must set it for any further virtual host explicitly.

When I went to my main class, I saw that all references to R had been marked red, and I was told that R could not be resolved to a variable. At first, I tried to rebuild and clean up my project, but that didnt work, so I am assuming that the issue lies in the XML file I recently edited, however I do now know where the issue would lie. And yes, I did make sure android.R was not being imported.  p  pA few additional detailsp  ul liI am using Android 5.0 API 21li liThe R issues do not appear in my other class files, which reference

Negative 2314 pIm trying to program a producer consumer problem by pushing and popping characters in and out of a queue. There are two main files, producer.c and consumer.c. Both of them have shared memory space initialized at the beginning. Producer will be run first and will initialize variables in the shared pointer static struct shared sharedptr. One of them is a queue struct Queue buffer.p  pProducer reads characters from a file and put into push the queue one at a time, and consumer reads, prints, and takes character out pop from the queue one at a time. p  pThe problem is producer runs no problem in terms of getting the queue pointer memptr  buffer and pushing characters in. However, producer cannot access the queue although it should have the same pointer to the queue. p  pIt properly prints when checking if the buffer is NULL when I tested with this if statementp  precodeifmemptr gt buffer  NULL     printfBuffer is empty.n else printfBuffer is not empty.n codepre  pThe segmentation fault happens when I tested with thisp  precodeifmemptr gt buffer  NULL     printfBuffer is empty.n else if memptr gt buffer gt tail  NULL     printfTail is NULL.

This didnt happen when I was testing with all the queuerelated functions in common.c provided below, and plus producer is running fine with it.p  pWhat is happening with the pointers Consumer can access other variables in struct shared memptr, but not buffer  tail.

The arrays are passed to methods that represent the templates.p  pIm new to java, and this is what I have managed to get done below, however shows errors saying void cannot be converted to string for each print message part.

I cant seem to do latex on this stack exchange, but anyway my problem now is a software problem.p  pI implemented this in Scala by hiding a var deep inside the thunks that create EMA functions.  This all works, but its super tricky, because calling ema5 and then ema5 again will naturally lead to a different result.  Id like to try redoing all of this using State Monads, but Im quickly getting lost in the weeds.  p  pFor example, I have the following simplified EMA State monad in Haskellp  precodeimport Control.Monad.State  type EMAState  Double type Tau  Double  ema  Tau gt Double gt State EMAState Double ema tau x  state  y gt   let alpha  1  tau       mu  expalpha       mu  1  mu       y  mu  y  mu  x   in y, y codepre  pwhich I can readily test in GHCIp  precodeMain Control.Monad.Stategt runState ema 5 10 0 1.8126924692201818,1.8126924692201818 codepre  papplying the input 10 to a 5period EMA initialized to 0.  This is all well and good, using forM I can apply multiple input values etc.  Now, the next step is to implement an iterated EMA, which is an EMA applied to itself N times.  p  precodeiEMA[n]x  EMAiEMA[n1]x codepre  pEach of these intermediate EMAs will need to have their own state, aka previous result, to correctly calculate the vector of iterated EMAs.  So, what I am looking for, is something which like this, I thinkp  precodeiema  Int gt Tau gt Double gt State [EMAState] [Double] codepre  pWhich is essentially a daisy chain of EMAsp  precodeiEMA[3]x  EMAEMAEMAx,s1,s2,s3  x, [s1,s2,s3] gt [y1,y2,y3], [s1,s2,s3] codepre  pAnd if all I care about is the 3rd iterated EMA ... p  precode... gt y3, [s1, s2, s3] codepre  pThe paper moves on from there, creating ever more complex operators built on iterated EMAs and averages of them etc, so I want to be able to functionally and purely compose these stateful operators building ever more complex states, but still quite simple input and output.  p  pI really feel like this is what functional programming is good at, but I dont yet have the expertise to see how to put together these State monads in the correct way.  Could someone please point me in the right direction with these iterated recurrence operators  p  pEDITp  pA couple of helpful folks have suggested repeated application of the same ema operator to the input data, but this is not sufficient.  Each ema operator needs to maintain its own previous value.  Heres an examplep  precodetau 5                mu  0.818730753              muprime 0.181269247                      ema1    ema2    ema3          x   0       0       0       lt States0     1   0.1812  0.03285 0.00595 lt States1     5   1.0547  0.21809 0.04441 lt States2 codepre  pThe x column is the raw input, ema1 uses its left for input and its up for recurrencestate.  ema2 uses its left for input not x and its up for state.  Its an ema ema x .  Ditto ema3  ema ema ema x  .  What I would like to do, which I think must be possible, is given an ema state monad, compose the ema3 state monad, or even better, the [ema] state monad with each each subsequent ema operating on the output of the previous.p

Negative 2314 pstrongHey therestrongp  pstrongHere is the scenestrongp  pI am working on a strongWordpressstrong site that should have its users integrated to a strongMedia Wikistrong setup. Everything is working great by using a Media Wiki extension called a hrefhttpwww.mediawiki.orgwikiExtensionWPMW relnofollowWPMWa. When users from Wordpress log in they are automatically added to Media Wiki user database and they become affiliated to the Wiki as well. strongSuccess so far.strongp  pstrongHere is what I need to dostrongp  pI need to, upon Wordpress  Media Wiki user login through the WPMW extension, find a way to update a single specific Media Wiki page based on information I gather from the current user on the process. For example when the Wordpress user called strongOlafstrong strongEditorstrong role, connects to Media Wiki, I want to simply write append to a special Wiki page called strongEditorstrong the name strongOlafstrong, that will be together with other existent names.p  pSo I researched about strongMedia Wiki APIstrong, and after following some examples, I was able to create a PHP file where, after being accessed on the server, it locates a specific code and append text to it even using a Media Wiki template built previously. strongSuccess againstrong, but only for stand alone use... I need to go to example.commyscript.php to make it work.p  pstrongHere is the problemstrongp  pI tried to to insert my API code inside the WPMW Extension, but it is obvious that things are not simple as that, and everything stopped to work. So, I wonder, what could be the correct way to, stronginside a Media Wiki extension, call the Media Wiki APIstrong and give instructions to it to append text to a Media Wiki page, based on strongPHP variablesstrong present at the moment of the WPMW login executionp  pFor example When Olaf Editor is logged on Wordpress and goes to the Wiki, the WPMW Extension gets active and makes the bridge  by registering automatically the Olaf to the Wiki database if it is his first time  or by simply logging Olaf into Media Wiki site.p  pAt this point, I am able to get from Wordpress, as variables, all data relevant to me, the strongUsernamestrong and the strongUser Rolestrong. But how to use them to strongappendstrong the strongOlafstrong name to a strongWiki pagestrong called strongEditorsstrongp  pstrongHere is my API code, based on examples I foundstrongp  precodeltphp settings[wikiroot]  httpexample.comwiki settings[user]   shangchi settings[pass]   mypassword settings[domain]  Windows settings[cookiefile]  cookies.tmp   Test use a Wiki template to append to page prepend  testnn   function httpRequesturl, post          global settings          ch  curlinit         Change the user agent below suitably         curlsetoptch, CURLOPTUSERAGENT, applicationxwwwformurlencoded         curlsetoptch, CURLOPTURL, url         curlsetoptch, CURLOPTENCODING, UTF8          curlsetoptch, CURLOPTRETURNTRANSFER, true         curlsetoptch, CURLOPTCOOKIEFILE, settings[cookiefile]         curlsetoptch, CURLOPTCOOKIEJAR, settings[cookiefile]         curlsetoptch, CURLOPTSSLVERIFYPEER, false         if emptypost curlsetoptch,CURLOPTPOSTFIELDS,post         UNCOMMENT TO DEBUG TO output.tmp         curlsetoptch, CURLOPTVERBOSE, true  Display communication with server         fp  fopenoutput.tmp, w         curlsetoptch, CURLOPTSTDERR, fp  Display communication with server          xml  curlexecch          if xml                  throw new ExceptionError getting data from server url  . curlerrorch                   vardumpxml          curlclosech          return xml    function login user, pass, token          global settings          url  settings[wikiroot] . api.phpactionloginampformatxml          params  actionloginamplgnameuseramplgpasswordpass         if emptysettings[domain]              params . amplgdomain . settings[domain]                  if emptytoken                  params . amplgtokentoken                   data  httpRequesturl, params          if emptydata                  throw new ExceptionNo data received from server.

Negative 2314 pI apologize in advance but I am a newbie at JS. p  pI have a asp.net mvc project that requires a realtime representation of data. Using datatables jquery ajax features I have been able to incrementally get information from the database and reload the table. However when the reload function is called the table is redrawn therefore any interaction the user had with the datatable is reset. p  pI think the best way to solve this problem is to detect some kind of user interaction with the datatable and temporarily pause the setincrement function so that the table wont reload. Then wait for so many seconds after interaction and then continue to start the reload process again. p  pI dont know JS enough to be able to program any such detection or even pause andor reset the incrementer. Any help would be greatly appreciated whether it be answering my question directly or with a better solution.p  pHere is my current JS for scripting the reload and setting the datatable p  precodedocument.readyfunction           var table  myDataTable.DataTable             autoWidth false,             bProcessing false,             sAjaxSource Url.ActionGetDropData, Drops,              columns             [                  width 10 ,                  width 50 ,                  width 40              ]                   setIntervalfunction                table.ajax.reloadnull, false  user paging is not reset on reload          , 500       codepre

Negative 2314 pIs it possible to dynamically add to the list of interfaces implemented by an object such that codeinstanceofcode returns true and casts dont failp  pI have a set of objects whose types need to change dynamically during runtime. As their state changes, more of their methodsproperties become valid. Currently, this is done in a bruteforce way... all members are exposed, and calling the wrong one at the wrong time is a bug. Ideally, I would like to use static typing, and to pass these objects to methods which expect specific interfaces. The set of interfaces that an object implements will only increase, so old references would remain valid.p  pIs it possible to change an objects implemented interfaces at runtime, either using builtin reflection or via thirdparty bytecode manipulationp

Negative 2314 pIn our project we currently moved to Java 8 and want to use now the internal XML libraries instead of additional ones. For that we removed e.g. our xalan.jar from our classpath.p  pThis leads to ClassNotFoundExceptions when trying to render our XML files. Within the XSL stylesheets we ue to transform the XML files, we also call external Java methods as in the following examplep  precode ltxslstylesheet version1.0 xmlnsxslhttpwww.w3.org1999XSLTransform    xmlnsfohttpwww.w3.org1999XSLFormat    xmlnsjavahttpxml.apache.orgxalanjavagt  ...  ltxsltemplate nameexamplegt   ltfoblockgt     ltxslvalueof selectjavamy.package.name.JavaClass.testMethodtestgt   ltfoblockgt ltxsltemplategt ... codepre  pHowever, always when the external method codetestMethodcode should be called, the process stops with a ClassNotFoundException. I debugged the code in the codecom.sun.org.apache.xalan.internal.xsltc.compiler.FunctionCallcode class and found that XSLTC tries to instantiate the codemy.package.name.JavaClasscode in order to call the codetestMethodcode. Which is okay. But...p  pThe class is tried to be instantiatedloaded within the following code of codecom.sun.org.apache.xalan.internal.utils.ObjectFactorycodep  precode       Find a Class using the same class loader for the ObjectFactory by default       or boot class loader when Security Manager is in place           public static Classltgt findProviderClassString className, boolean doFallback         throws ClassNotFoundException, ConfigurationError              return findProviderClass className,                 findClassLoader , doFallback      codepre  pwhich further calls codefindClassLoadercode to get the correct class loader to load my codeJavaClasscodep  precode       Figure out which ClassLoader to use.  For JDK 1.2 and later use       the context ClassLoader.           public static ClassLoader findClassLoader              if System.getSecurityManagernull              this will ensure bootclassloader is used             return null                    Figure out which ClassLoader to use for loading the provider          class.  If there is a Context ClassLoader then use it.         ClassLoader context  SecuritySupport.getContextClassLoader         ClassLoader system  SecuritySupport.getSystemClassLoader          ClassLoader chain  system         while true              if context  chain  ...loop to get correct class loader          codepre  pNow in our project we have the problem that we have a SecurityManager implementation in place which means this implementation above just returns codenullcode instead of the context classloader.p  pBTW I would also expect to get the context classloader here, but with additional checks later if the SecurityManager allows to load a class, why des it just return null herep  pThis again means that my class is tried to be loaded with the boot classloader which does not know my class and therefore throws the exception. Removing the SecurityManager returns the context classloader which is able to load my class and the XML can be successfully transformed.p  pSo  if you are still here and asleep  is there a way to be able to still use my external Java methods in the XSL stylesheets Is there a way to load my class in this situation I thought about the following maybe possible solutions, but they all do not really satisfy mep  ul lipatch the ObjectFactory, remove or extend the check for a SecurityManager and put it on the boot classpath of my application that it is loaded before the original one dirty hackli liremove the SecurityManager is more or less a dummy implementation for now, but this would not be a permanent solutionli liwrite the Java methods as extension functions in XSL not sure if this works for all methods we have and would be very timeconsuming and errorprone also Im not sure if this really solves the issueli lipuse reflection to create an instance of my JavaClass inside the XSL in the following wayp  p pli ul  pHowever, the last way is also not working as the class is also loaded with the AppClassLoader and probably also not available during the parsing process. But maybe there is a similar solutionp  pThanks in advance.p  pBest Regards, Jensp

Negative 2314 pThis question doesnt address any programming language in particular but of course Im happy to hear some examples.p  pImagine a big number of files, lets say 5000, that have all kinds of letters and numbers in it. Then, there is a method that receives a user input that acts as an alias in order to display that file. Without having the files sorted in a folder, the methods need to return the file name that is associated to the alias the user provided.p  pSo lets say user input gd322 stands for the file named k4e23, the method would look likep  precode  ifinput.equalsgd322             return k4e23                             codepre  pNow, imagine having 4 values in that methodp  precodeswitchinput  case gd322 return fw332 case g344d return 5g4gh case s3red return 536fg case h563d return h425d    switch on string, no break, no string indicators, ..., pls ignore the syntax, its just pseudo codepre  pKeeping in mind we have 5000 entries, there are probably more than just 2 entries starting with g. Now, if the user input starts with s, instead of wasting CPU cycles checking all the as, bs, cs, ..., we could also make another switch for this, which then directs to the next methods like thisp  precode switchinput[0] implying we could access strings like that      case a switchAinput     case b switchBinput  [...]     case g switchGinput     case s switchSinput        codepre  pSo the CPU doesnt have to check on all of them, but rather calls a method like thisp  precodeswitchGString input   switchinput    case gd322 return fw332    case g344d return 5g4gh    [...]     codepre  pIs there any field of computer science dealing with this I dont know how to call it and therefore dont know how to search for it but I think my thoughts make sense on a large scale. Pls move the thread if it doesnt belong here but I really wanna see your thoughts on this.p  pEDIT dont quote me on that 5000, I am not in the situation described above and I wanted to talk about this completely theoretical, it could also be 3 entries or 300000, maybe even less or more p

Negative 2314 pIm trying to do long polling with JQuery and Python under the Flask Framework.p  pHaving done long polling before in PHP, Ive tried to go about it in the same wayp  pA scriptfunction that has a whiletrue loop, checking for changes periodically eg.every 0,5 seconds in the database, and returns some data when a change occurs.p  pSo in my stronginistrong.py Ive created an app.route to poll for JQuery to call.

Negative 2314 pI am in this very unfortunate situationp  ul liMy website is using outdated software security patches are applied with OpenSSL 0.9.8o 01 Jun 2010 which doesnt support TLSv1.11.2li liI also have payment gateway which is PCI DSS compliant therefore SSL and early TLS is disabled thereli ul  pMy website used to exchange data with payment gateway but as TLSv1.0 is dropped I can no longer use phps cURL library or even codefilegetcontentscode or wgetlynxcurl via shellp  pIs there any workaround, any option how to connect TLSv1.1 secured server without using builtin librariesp  pI know some classes exists in PHP like a hrefhttpphpseclib.sourceforge.netphpsecliba which is SSH client, great for people who cant use a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenbook.ssh2.phpSSH2 moduleap  pDoes something like that exists for PHP Is there any way I can connect to my gatewayp  pSo far my best idea is connecting to gateway thru other server with updated softwarep
Negative 2314 pI am struggling to handle an errors response using Ember Data and the ActiveModelAdapter. I have Googled around and the consensus is that the json format needs to be errors fieldname [My error message, another error] but although I am returning this in a HTTP 500 response my models errors property remains an empty Ember object.p  pAlso, from what I have read Ember Data is compatible with the JSON API standard created by Embers Yehuda Katz so Id like to return errors in the following format if possiblep  pa hrefhttpjsonapi.orgformaterrors relnofollowhttpjsonapi.orgformaterrorsap  pThis would allow me to return a title, code etc. However, all of the examples that I can find of Ember Data handling errors do not demonstrate this format being used and they seem to limit the error format to a field name key and one or more message strings. Am I mistaken in thinking that the ActiveModelAdapter can handle this type of responsep  pIf anyone could help me with this Id be grateful.p  pThanks.p

Negative 2314 pHi I have an abstract class in which I have some public methods and some abstract ones. I have the public so that they implement the common methods for the derived classes.p  pWhat is confusing me is why I will want to define a public abstract method instead of protected abstract. That makes no sense to me to define a public abstract method in abstract class.... because if is an abstract will be overridden, in the derived classes, but the same is if is defined as public but somehow it makes more sense to define it as protected as we know that we will override that in the derived classes.p  pIs it wrong to define the method as public abstract in an abstract class Which is better and whyp

It consistently fails at this point no mater what the Xms Xmx XX values are. Do I have to add some other value to environment so that it starts working fine. The general solution in these kind of problems is increasing the memory value in XXMaxPermSize but its not helping p  pMore Context The ant builds 8 applications. The build works fine till the 6th application and all of them have similar customrules.xml file. But it fails when it is building 7th application. p  pIf you need more information then mention it in the comment section Ill add it. I have googled a lot regarding this problem and tried to solve it using the solutions, but was never successful. p

Negative 2314 pHere is what I am trying to understand.  I have the following database tablep  precodeDROP TABLE IF EXISTS test CREATE TABLE test    Field0 int11 NOT NULL,   Field1 int11 NOT NULL,   Field2 enuma,b,c COLLATE latin2czechcs NOT NULL  ENGINEInnoDB DEFAULT CHARSETlatin2 COLLATElatin2czechcs  INSERT INTO test Field0, Field1, Field2 VALUES 10,    11, a, 10,    13, b, 10,    13, a codepre  pNote the absence of any indexes, unique keys... . Before someone tells me that is not a good idea I have strung together this example for a good reason.p  pNow suppose I use Adminer you could just as easily read phpMyAdmin etc to edit  Row 2p  precode10,13,b codepre  pNow after the edit if the SQL that were issued werep  precodeUPDATE test SET Field2  c WHERE Field0  10 AND Field1  13 codepre  pMySQL would update strongtwo rowsstrong and the table would readp  precode10,11,a 10,13,c 10,13,c codepre  pwhich is not the desired result and not what Adminer does.  It appears to know what row to update and does just that.  It is not clear to me how this is done.  With many other statements  e.g. codeCREATE TABLEcode it is possible to deliberately use invalid assignments .e.g attempt to assign a length to a codeTEXTcode field and then study the SQL on error. However, that option does not exist on row edits since Adminer actively stops you from doing invalid edits e.g. typing in a char in an integer column.p  pAbout the only way I can think of is to tag on a codeLIMIT 1code at the end of the statement  which would work, kind of.  However, in a table with a larger number of fields it would involve putting in a very lengthy WHERE clause when only one or two fields in that row have changed in order to help MySQL identify the emrightem row to alter.p  pPerhaps there are other techniques to accomplish this that are not quite so crude that I am not aware of  Id be most grateful to anyone who might be able to help.p  pTo finish this post  please dont tell me that rows strongshouldstrong  be unique and I should be using indices.  I am well aware of that. This is simply the worst case scenario that I am trying to resolve.p  hr  pI should mention that although this question talks of MySQL I am in fact using MariaDB 10.p

Negative 2314 pI am trying to understand and handle the different ways a web socket connection could be closed. From a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.web.websockets.aspnetwebsocket.closeasyncvvs.110.aspx relnofollowmsdnap  blockquote   pYou can use the CloseAsync and CloseOutputAsync methods for both   clientinitiated and serverinitiated requests to close an   AspNetWebSocket connection. The two methods handle clientinitiated   requests in the same way After the client sends a message to the   server to close the connection, the server calls one of these methods   and sends an acknowledgment to the client, and then the method   returns. p      pFor serverinitiated requests, the two methods work   differently. The CloseAsync method sends a message to the client to   close the connection, waits for a response, and then returns. The   server does not wait for any additional data sent by the client. In   contrast, the CloseOutputAsync method sends a message to the client to   close the connection and returns without waiting for a response. After   the method returns, you can call the ReceiveAsync method and handle   either additional data or the acknowledgment that the client sends.p blockquote  pIn my application the client basically sits there receiving updates from the server, but never actually sends anything to the server outside of opening the connection. However the client also needs to be able to close the connection from their side.p  pBasically the servers role is to sit there waiting to open a connection, send a bunch of stuff, and handle clients closing connections but never has to decide to close the connection or not. p  pSo no matter, when we are talking about cleanly closing a connection, a client needs to send the server a message saying it wants to close the connection, correctp  pSo the client will need to do something likep  precodevar x  await closeAsyncWebSocketCloseStatus.NormalClosure, null, CancellationToken.None codepre  pHow does the server know the client executed closeAync I tried to send a piece of data from server to client using p  precodeawait sendAsyncnew ArraySegmentltbytegtinfoBytes, 1, false, cancelled codepre  pand received an errorp  blockquote   pThe received message type Text is invalid after calling   WebSocket.CloseAsync.

Negative 2314 pIve been reading a lot of articles about DDD and noticed that most are using GUID as their ID when persisting to a database.

We call it referral.p  pNow what Im planning to do is to have codeMemberIdcode of GUID type as the DomainObject Id where it serves as the primary key which will be used for joins, foreign keys on Referral, refererid would be the GUID codeMemberIdcode. codeAccountNocode will be an autoincrement column or maybe it will be acquired from repository by MAX  1. Mainly it will be used for search features in the system and in links.p  pShould the ID of DomainObject remain hidden to users of the system since its just a technical implementationp  pIs it ok to combine both GUID as rowid in database Surrogate Key. and AutoIncrement for Natural Keyp  pIs it okay to exclude the codeAccountNocode from the constructor because it will be autoincremented anyway What about the need to enforce invariants So is getting the next ID from repository the way to go and include codeAccountNocode in the constructorp  pShould I just stick with AutoIncrement ID and forget about GUID, remove codeMemberIdcode and let the codeAccountNocode be the ID of the DomainObjectp  pNOTEp  pI am not building the next facebook of some kind.p  psI just want to practice the Tactical side of DDD to learn how to make hard architectural decisions knowing their PROS and CONS.sp  pI just want to practice the Strategic side of DDD to learn how to make hard architectural decisions knowing their PROS and CONS and their implementation.p  pIf we will make 3 scenarios with member registrationp  ul liFirst Scenario Member registration happens every minute.li liSecond Scenario Member registration happens every hour.li liThird Scenario Member registration happens atmost 5 daily.li ul  pHow will it affect the decisionsp  pTechnology Stackp  ul liASP MVC 5li liSql Server 2014li liCli liDapper ORMli ul

Sets do not invalidate any other iterators  ok to use the nextiterator. For vectors Id need to store the previous iterator if any and return that. For a deque and similar wo iterator return this wont work at all. I dont want to implement an EraseImpl for all known containers as e.g. this would require me to include all their headers which I want to avoid.p  pIs there anything I can to to avoid specializing it for all types Of course I can create a trait with an enum like UseNext, UsePrev and leave it unspecialised for containers invalidating all iterators. But again I dont want to include all possible headers.p

Negative 2314 pBit of back storyp  pMy Node app, called Sleepychat in production, hosted on Heroku recently started reporting Memory Limit Reached errors at 512MB. Luckily, Heroku allows this and wont crash the app until 5 times is reached, so thats good. However, I find it strange that this occurred only just after a recent push to Heroku which involved nothing more than adding a page. My theory was that Heroku might have used a newer version of Node on the update, but it seems that isnt the case. I downgraded and the error still occurs.p  pMy source can be found on a hrefhttpgithub.comMrMeapifysleepychatblobmasterapp.js relnofollowGitHuba. Line 185 is the connection code, and line 1553 is the disconnect code.p  pNow, Ive had some time to run through the code using New Relic and Node Inspector to profile it, and it seems that any connection, whether allowed or immediately refused and disconnected, allocates a small amount of memory which isnt released upon disconnection.p  pFor example, I navigate to localhost, the page connects on document ready, and New Relic shows a slight increase in memory. Usually about 500kb which still seems large to me, but Im guessing thats mostly the socket object. When I disconnect, no change occurs in New Relic. Whats more interesting, is that I can spam page refreshes to rapidly spike memory usage. Earlier I mentioned that it doesnt matter whether or not the connection is refused. By this, I meant that after 3 connections within 15 seconds of each other, the site will immediately refuse new connections and disconnect.p  pDespite this, page refreshes which automatically connect increases RAM. Ive looked through many times to see if Im not releasing something, but to my knowledge, everything should be managed by the scope, so I have no idea whats leaking.p  pIve noticed some odd behavior once I added New Relic, though. Firstly, once Sleepychat hits its limit of 512MB, Heroku will report a Memory Limit Reached error, but New Relic will display as if a large chunk 100MB has been released. Despite that display, Heroku would later report an even higher usage on its next error. Secondly, New Relic reports a drop in memory usage whenever I use Node Inspector to record heap allocations, but goes right back up once I stop the recording.p  pHeres a snapshot file from Node Inspector Actually an allocation timeline. 10 seconds in is when I start spamming page refreshes. Additionally, heres an image of what New Relic reports.p  pSnapshot a hrefhttpwww.mediafire.comdownload3556q7bec856cal20150808T134745.heapsnapshot relnofollowSnapshot Fileap  pNew Relicbr img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comOOZOH.png p  pI have no idea whats going on.

Negative 2314 pI have two viewsp  precodetableView view codepre  pview is in front of the tableView, but when I apply an animated transform to views layer, the view animates behind tableView. Theres no clipping going on, Ive checked.p  pWhat Id like during the animation is for view to be rotated about its bottom centre around the x axis, causing it to essentially fall over tableView.

Negative 2314 pBackground info I have set up Azure to automatically deploy code from develop branch on Github to devwebapp when code is pushed to develop branch. When code is pushed to master branch, Azure deploys code from master branch to testwebapp and pre proddeployment slot.p  pIn Azure Im using New Relic Appservice to monitor these apps. It works. What I want now is to notify New Relic when code is deployed to a webapp.p  pQuote New Relicp  blockquote   pTo notify New Relic of a deployment, you can POST to a hrefhttpsapi.newrelic.comdeployments.xml relnofollowhttpsapi.newrelic.comdeployments.xmla and add the API key as a headerp blockquote  pTo notify New Relic when code is deployed to dev and test, I could set up webhook in GitHub to run when code is pushed to developbranch and masterbranch. I have tested this, and it works. I feel like it is not optimal since the notification comes from Github, and not from Azure which is where the deployment actually takes place.p  pI also want to notify New Relic when the preprod deploymentslot is swapped with prod.p  pIs it possible And what could be the best way to do this p  pMaybe webjobs could be the soulution This should be a webjob that only runs once after webapp is deployed and deploymentslot is swapped for prod. I cannot find any information about setting up such job.p
