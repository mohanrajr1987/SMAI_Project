Positive 529 pIve been given the task of changing all our legacy software installation packages to conform to Win 7 and 8. Previously our software would run on XP and Win Server 2003 and would simply be installed into the program files folder and run without any worry.  Nowadays, or since the introduction of UAC, installing into the program files opens up some issues regarding privileges when it comes to file creation, changing and deletion. Furthermore the whole wow64 redirection thing, where our legacy applications would be run from a different folder than the actual installation folder Program files x86.p  pstrongCut to the chasestrong Our legacy software is running on dedicated computers, only used for running our SW. Ive previously bypassed the whole problem with UAC and WOW64 redirection as a hotfixhack by simply installing the software outside the program files folders.  Now we are looking for a permanent solution, and I was actually thinking of making my previous hotfix the solution. So simply install our software on for example csoftware and by doing so bypass the whole issue with UAC and WOW64.p  pstrongQuestionstrong What are if any the pitfalls when installing legacy x86 software outside the program files folderp

Positive 529 pWe have SQL Server 2012 and VS2010 Pro installed which we use for SSISRSAS jobs. I have installed Vs2013 Pro alongside this as we need to use it for MVC 5 development. Everything is working fine. I cannot create any new SSIS jobs in VS2013 and any existing jobs automatically open in VS2010.  However our DBA has found out we have installed VS2013 and is concerned it will have overwritten some SQL server components and wants us to uninstall it and stick to older version. I can find no problems using both of them. p  pIs it fine to be able to use them both He asked if I selected install SQL Server components when I installed it but I honestly dont remember. I used defaults. He was concerned if we tried to open old SSIS jobs in VS2013 it would try and upgrade them but it doesnt even let me, it just says incompatible.  I need to convince him there are no issues with having them bothif this is the case. MAny thanksp

If the value of this property is NO, the scroll view does not scroll regardless of finger movement once the content view starts tracking.p  pRather opaque huh Anyway, it seems to work.p

Negative 529 pSo, Ive been coding for a little 2 years, and I have a very subjective questionp  pIs it wrong to use REQUEST for Datap  pThis mainly pertains to authentication by the way. p  pIf you think about the 3 ways data can occur in codeREQUESTcode, it can come from either a cookie, a form, or a query string. Now, I know that most people directly grab the information from either codePOSTcode or codeGETcode, using codeCOOKIEcode only when they are expecting a cookie. p  pMy theory is that in reality, there shouldnt be any difference in this data, and it shouldnt make any difference if you replaced codePOSTcode or codeGETcode with codeREQUESTcode.p  pIf you are authenticating a user into the system, does it really mattered if the authentication details are contained in the codePOSTcode or codeGETcode array Heck, it probably shouldnt matter if they are in codeCOOKIEcode either. They are still giving you credentials to log into the site, which you should check for correctness, and if so log them in.p  pNow, I do realize there are security issues if you try to have a login form that submits data via a query string, but I dont believe that pertains to the question. Also, if someone fails a login too many times, there should be proper limits set in place to avoid overloading the server.p  pId like to here the opinion about this. p  pCommunity Wikid for good measure.p  phrp  pOh, and just by the way, here are other StackOverflow questions that relate if you have other questions about codeREQUESTcodep  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions368329phpusinggetpostinsteadofrequesthttpstackoverflow.comquestions368329phpusinggetpostinsteadofrequesta a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions107683whenandwhyshouldrequestbeusedinsteadofgetpostcookiehttpstackoverflow.comquestions107683whenandwhyshouldrequestbeusedinsteadofgetpostcookieap
Negative 529 pI am trying to run a 64 bit executable java.exe from our 32bit .NET application. I am using codeProcesscode class and invoking codecmd c ltcommand namegtcode in order to support all possible commands like codedircode, codecdcode etc.p  pThe problem is that on my machine I installed 64bit version of JRE and java.exe is only available from codeCWindowsSystem32code folder x64. I have tried explicily starting 64 bit version of codecmd.execode by calling codeCWindowsSystem32cmd.execode but it gets redirected to codeSysWOW64code due to calling process being 32 bit. p  pIs there anything else I can do to get this to workp  pstrongEDITstrong The whole codecmd ccode thing is a bit of a red herring. It is not part of the problem, being able to run 64 bit executables is.p
Negative 529 pIm working on an iPhone OS app whose primary view is a 2D OpenGL view this is a subclass of Apples EAGLView class, basically setting up an orthoprojected 2D environment that the user interacts with directly.p  pSometimes not at all times Id like to render some controls on top of this baseline GL view think like a HeadsUp Display. Note that the baseline view underneath may be scrollinganimating while controls should appear to be fixed on the screen above.p  pIm good with Cocoa views in general, and Im pretty good with CoreGraphics, but Im green with Open GL, and the EAGLViews operations and its relationship to CALayers is fairly opaque to me. Im not sure how to mix in other elements most effectively read best performance, least hassle, etc. I know that in a pinch, I can create and keep around geometry for all the other controls, and render those on top of my baseline geometry every time I paintswap, and thus just keep everything the user sees on one single view. But Im less certain about other techniques, such as having another view on top UIKitCG or GL or somehow creating other layers in my single view, etc.p  pIf people would be so kind to write up some brief observations if theyve travelled these roads before, or at least point me to documentation or existing discussion on this issue, Id greatly appreciate it.p  pThanks.p

Negative 529 pI know this probably is not the easiest thing to do, but I am trying to connect Microcontroller and PC using USB. I dont want to use internal USART of Microcontroller or USB to RS232 converted, its project indended to help me understand various principles.p  pSo, getting the communication done from the Microcontroller side is piece of cake  I mean, when I know he protocol, its relativelly easy to implement it on Micro, becouse I am in direct control of evrything, even precise timing.p  pBut this is not the case of PC. I am not very familiar with concept of Windows handling the devices connected. In one of my previous question I ask about how Windows works with devices thru drivers. I understood that for internal use of Windows, drivers must have some default set of functions available to OS. I mean, when OS wants to access HDD, it calls HDD driver which is probably internal in OS, with specific questions so that means that HDD driver has to be written to cooperate with Windows, to have write function in the proper place to be called by the OS. Something similiar is for GPU, Even DirectX, I mean DirectX must call specific functions from drivers, so drivers must be written to work with DX. I know, many functions from WinAPI works on their own, but even simple window must be in the end written into framebuffer, using MMIO to adress specified by drivers. Am I rightp  pSo, I expected that Windows have internal functions, parts of WinAPI designed to work with certain comonly used things. To call manufacturerdesigned drivers. But this seems to not be entirely true becouse Windows has no way to communicate thru Paralel port. I mean, there is no function in the WinAPI to work with serial port, but there are funcions to work with HDD,GPU and so.p  pBut now there comes the part I am getting very lost at. So, I think Windows must have some builtin functions to communicate thru USB, becouse for example it handles USB flash memory. So, is there any WinAPI function designed to let user to operate USB thru that function, or when I want to use USB myself, do I have to call desired USBdriver function myself Becouse all you need to send to USB controller is device adress and the infromation right I mean, I dont have to write any new drivers, am I right Just to call WinAPI function if there is such, or directly call original USB driver. Does any of this make some sense  p

Checking whether an element has a scrollbar isnt as trivial as it seems. The first formula Ive written above works fine when element doesnt have a border, but when it does especially when border is of considerable width, codeoffsetcode dimension can be larger than codescrollcode dimension but the element can still be scrollable. We actually have to subtract borders from codeoffsetcode dimension to get the actual scrollable viewport of the element and compare that to codescrollcode dimension.p  h2For future referenceh2  pcodescrollablecode jQuery selector filter is included in my code.scrollintoviewcode jQuery plugin.

This works fine when the characters are in the Latin1 character set. When I try to post a Japanese character or some Unicode character, it doesnt come through on the Java side.p  pFileReference.upload ignores the contenttype setting and uses a ContentType of multipartformdata by default.

Negative 529 pI am trying to submit data to a database.  I have an update form that has several fields on it that pulls data from the database into the fields.  Submitting it updates the data in the database.  The two fields i am concerned with our two image uploaders that i have in the form.  I have been doing this successfully when i have only one image uploader on the page, but cant wrap my head around the conditional syntax when i add the second one.  Below is the code that i am using for the forms that have only one image uploader.  It looks to see if that submitted element is empty.  If so, it runs an update statement and leaves out the image variable.  If the image variable is not empty it runs an update statement with that field added to the statement.p  precodeifimgProfileFull   query  update students set nameFirst  nameFirst, nameLast  nameLast, profile  profile, priority  priority, active  active, modifiedDate  modifiedDate where id  id else ifFILES[image][type]  imagejpeg  FILES[image][type]  imagepjpeg ampamp FILES[image][size] lt 500000    ifFILES[image][error] gt 0     headerlocationstudents.phpfileerror   else     moveuploadedfileFILES[image][tmpname],     ..imagesstudentsfull . imgProfileFull    else   headerlocationstudents.phpfileerror  query  update students set imgProfileFull  imgProfileFull, nameFirst  nameFirst, nameLast  nameLast, profile  profile, priority  priority, active  active, modifiedDate  modifiedDate where id  id  codepre  pHow would i write my update statement to include another image field.  The variable would be codeimgProfileThumbcode.  Basically i want to update the two image columns in the database if, and only if, they are NOT empty.  This is because the way the form is built, the image field is technically always empty unless an image actually gets uploaded.  Any thoughts  Thanksp

You can see the content of the cell which is changed to BLUE is now display as BLANKp  pThen I unistall the JRE 6u24 and install JRE of other version. The conclusion is that the problem only happens with version after 6U22including 6U22.It works well with version before 6u21including 6u21.p  pSo it seems a bug of JRE of version 6U22. p  pAny help would be greatly appreciated p

Negative 529 pOK, Im asking for it, I know.  Please bear with me.p  pI have a ltform that is embedded in between some table row tags, something like thisp  precodelttablegt   lttrgt     lttdgtfoolttdgt   lttrgt   ltformgt   lttrgt     lttdgtbarlttdgt   lttrgt   ltformgt lttablegt codepre  pI know that is illegal placement of the form tag, but all the browsers Ive tried will allow it anyhow.  I dont have control over the design of this code, so please bear with me.p  pWhen I load this page with JQuery and the JQuery UI.Layout plugin see a hrefhttplayout.jquerydev.netindex.cfm relnofollowhttplayout.jquerydev.netindex.cfma , the table rows that are enclosed by the form tag are no longer rendered.  I assume because forms dont have any display properties themselves that either JQuery or the UI.Layout plugin are forcing those rows to inherit that lack of display.p  pFirebug shows those rows grayed out and indented one level below the form tag, which corresponds to their lack of display I think.  Interestingly, when I dont use any of the JQuery stuff, Firebug shows those rows as NOT indented, but instead at the SAME level as the form tag that encloses them and of course they are not grayed out  OH I also just noticed Firebug doesnt even show a closing form tag at all in this case.p  pIm unsure if its JQuery, the UI.Layout plugin, or something Ive done with JavaScript that has caused this, and Im still digging around, but theres a lot of code in those libraries, so Id really appreciate pointers if anyone has any.p  pIs there a way to prevent this, or possibly force those table rows to have some display  Maybe the form tag needs some display property placed on it so those rows inherit itp  pIm a big advocate of standardscompliant code, but sometimes the boss just wont listen.  So please spare the fix your code comments if thats all youve got.  I appreciate it, but thats not what Im asking here.p
Negative 529 pIm working on a system that mirrors remote datasets using initials and deltas.  When an initial comes in, it mass deletes anything preexisting and mass inserts the fresh data.  When a delta comes in, the system does a bunch of work to translate it into updates, inserts, and deletes.  Initials and deltas are processed inside long transactions to maintain data integrity.p  pUnfortunately the current solution isnt scaling very well.  The transactions are so large and long running that our RDBMS bogs down with various contention problems.  Also, there isnt a good audit trail for how the deltas are applied, making it difficult to troubleshoot issues causing the local and remote versions of the dataset to get out of sync.p  pOne idea is to not run the initials and deltas in transactions at all, and instead to attach a version number to each record indicating which delta or initial it came from.  Once an initial or delta is successfully loaded, the application can be alerted that a new version of the dataset is available.p  pThis just leaves the issue of how exactly to compose a view of a dataset up to a given version from the initial and deltas.  Apples TimeMachine does something similar, using hard links on the file system to create view of a certain point in time.p  pDoes anyone have experience solving this kind of problem or implementing this particular solutionp  pThanksp

Negative 529 pIm facing a design challenge that I just cant seem to solve in a satisfactory way.  Ive got a class library assembly that contains all of my shared ORM objects using EntitySpaces framework.  These objects are used in 2 or more different applications which is why they are in their own assembly.  This setup has worked fine for 4 years for me.p  pI also have a couple of applications built on the Composite Application Block CAB from Microsofts Patterns amp Practices group PampP.  Yes, I know this is really old but Im a part time developer, onemanshop and cant afford to update to whatever the current framework is.p  pHere is where my problem comes in I have been exercising my OO design skills and whenever doing a substantial refactoring I try to shift from a procedural approach to a more OO approach.  Of course a major aspect of OO design is placing the operations close to the data they work with, this means that my ORM objects need to have functionality added to them where appropriate.  This is proving a real head scratcher when I also consider that Im using PampPs Object Builder DI container within CAB and that much of the functionality I would move into my ORM objects will need access to the services exposed by my applications.p  pIn other words, lets say I have a shared business object called Person original, I know and I have two applications that do ENTIRELY different things with a person.  Application A provides a set of services that the Person object would need to have DIed in order for it to take on some of the methods that are currently littered throughout my services layers.  Application B also has a different set of services that IT needs to have DIed into the person object.p  pConsidering how the PampP Object Builder resolves dependencies using attribute decoration and Type reflection I dont see how I can accomplish this.  In a nutshell, I have a shared object that when used in various applications I would need to inject dependencies so that it can perform certain operations specific to that application.p  pThe only approach I can come up with is to inherit a new Type in Application A amp B from the Person object.  I would then add my nonshared functionality and DI code into this applicationspecific specialized Person object.  Now that I write that it seems so obvious, however its still my only solution I can come up with and I wanted to ask here to see if anyone else had a different solution they would like to proposep  pOne problem I would have with my solution is that I can see myself getting caught up on naming my inherited type  I mean... its a person, so what else would you call it  Anyways, hopefully you will have some ideas for me.p  pAlso, Im not hip on the current technologies that are out there and really, to be honest only barely grasp the ones Im currently using.  So if Ive said something contradictory or confusing I hope you can understand enough from the rest of the post to get what Im asking.p

The actual scenario here isp  pI have got 2 asp pages, strongA.aspstrong and strongB.aspstrong.

I dont know why its not displaying image when its loaded. p

Negative 529 pthis I cant figure out dispite my best effort I got a table that has 4 cells the the first cell is longest, has a fixed width and a 2 row span. the 2nd cell is susposed to have a fixed heigth the contents of the 3rd cell are going to change often so I have no idea what the heigth is going to be. and the 4th cell has a col span of two.p  pit looks perfect in firefox as it seems to let me set the cel heigth, but it looks crappy in IE as its complety ignoring it and for some reason insted of makeing cell 2 the fixed heigth or even the heigth of the content it uses all the space the 3rd cell isnt using wich makes the headder look way bigger then it should when the content in the 3rd cell isnt big enough  this only seems to happen in IE I tested bouth Chrome and FireFox and they bouth do it like I want.

Negative 529 pstrongUPDATEstrong I had asked this perfectly valid question in two Startup forums and everyone was pointing me to StackOverflow as its a highly technical question how to successfully architect such a system. To my astonishment here in StackOverFlow my question gets closed.  If its not allowed to be answered here, where shall I ask it then, on facebookp  hr  pRight now my software has reached the demo stage with only one main user or lets call it account. This main account is using several main tables and some lookup tables. Therefore whatever data is stored within these main tables it is basically meant to be for this one account.p  pBut a SAAS is meant to serve many accounts and each one obviously should only see its own data when opening the app.p  pHow do I architect it properly So that when the customer logs in successfully he would get only to see the data assigned to him and see only his colleagues from his company in a dropdown list etcp  pShould each main table get a userId and a companyId column and all CRUD queries should filter on that when inserting, deleting or selecting a rowp  pMany Thanks for your advice, Kavep

Negative 529 pThis is maybe more of a design issue, but has also a technical background.p  pIn my current app I have following viewsp  pMovieOverview FriendsOverviewp  pThe app starts and will show my movie collection  with the MovieOverview view  and youll have a possibility to navigate to my friends through an appbar button.p  pWhen on the FriendsOverview view, Ill see my friends and when you pressselect a friend, I do a NavigationService.GoBack to the MovieOverview view, BUT with a parameter stating the new selected username  the selected friend . This will refresh the MovieOverview view and it will show the friend movie collection.p  pWhen at this point you press the friends appbar button, I will show my friends again, so the original unchanged lists  and not the friends of the selected friend .p  pDrawback on this approach, when you selected a friend an get back on the MovieOverview view, pressing the hard BACK button will exit the app, because of the NavigationService.GoBack I coded from the FriendsOverview view to the MovieOverview view.p  pSo my question, how do you designtechnical o about this Any tips, suggestions, everything is welcome.

Negative 529 pI originally got into programming by learning some javascript while trying to set up a website. I took to programming better than html and CSS and have since been learning more of it. Part of the problem was that I just wanted to do everything myself, all the javascript, CSS, HTML, everything. No external libraries or help. I wanted to understand and do all of it. The general hostility towards WYSIWYG programs from the development community didnt help either.p  pThe amount of work required to do everything completely on my own is what deterred me, though I didnt want to have everything handed to me. A bit down the line from learning programming I decided I wanted to make some simple programs like I kept seeing everyone else make in Visual Studio. With programs, I knew it wouldnt only be difficult, but near impossible for me to do anything but use Visual Studio. As amateur as it feels dragging and dropping buttons and controls and having all the code generated, its allowed me to work on the more personal aspects of the program and not the nitty gritty and has been a lot more fun.p  pIve decided that I want to give web development another shot, but this time with a little less ego. Is there any way I can have something like Visual C for websites p  pedit As of yet, I cant fund my website experiments, so Im using freehosting. The x10 hosting I use doesnt support asp.net, so I cant use VS for it .p

Negative 529 pWe have a request to implement our webservice response so that xsddecimal fraction digits will be zeropadded when its not long enough when a pattern indicates so.

Here is the relevant part of the xsd according to their specsp  precodeltxsdsimpleTypegt    ltxsdrestriction basexsddecimalgt        ltxsdtotalDigits value14gt        ltxsdfractionDigits value2gt        ltxsdpattern value[][09]1,12[.][09]2gt    ltxsdrestrictiongt ltxsdsimpleTypegt codepre  pSo the fractionDigits are set to 2 which means the precision can be a maximum of 2 digits. According to a hrefhttpzvon.orgxxlXMLSchemaTutorialOutputsertypesst2.html relnofollowhttpzvon.orgxxlXMLSchemaTutorialOutputsertypesst2.htmla it is also fine if there are less fraction digits for example for a number like 5.1p  pBut according to the pattern 2 there should always be 2 fraction digits.p  pWere developing a generic application development platform and theres no telling what the decimal will be used for in advance currency, pH values, distances, etc. This case comes from a specific project where our platform is being used but normally we wont know what kind of data is being transferred. We could decide to just follow the WSDL in this regard which states it should have 2 fraction digits. but our implementation of it must be very generic.p  pThere is nothing stating with what exactly these fraction digits should be padded with or even that we should pad instead of just leaving out this decimal altogether. In theory we could decide to pad with 5s until it matches the pattern. As far as I know patterns are rarely used and if they are its used for things like passwords. The XSD specification is vague though so it would be appreciated if someone could shed some light on whether this is valid use of an XSD and if it makes sense for us to decide to pad with 0s.p

I have the .plist property of required background mode App plays audio.p  pThe second issue, is to play the sound after some elapsed time. NSTimers doesnt work when on background mode, nor NSThread sleep on my background process or NSOperation. So how could I play this sound after say 10 seconds of the callp  pAlso, this behavior has to work also when the application is already on background mode. With CTCallCenter I am only getting the event when the application is interrupted from use, but I dont see any logs when i send the app to background and then beginreceive a call .p  pIf anyone could point me to the right direction Ill be really grateful.p

Running the script directly on the local webserver, again, gives me the expected results only if I am calling it on the same machine using the emulator, the troubles begin.p  pHere are the combinations I have tried so far the scripts are located in the subdirectory zz of the rootp  precodeprivate static String urlallvenues  http10.0.2.2zzpullvenuesjson.php codepre  porp  precodeprivate static String urlallvenues  http10.0.2.280zzpullvenuesjson.php codepre  pleads to the following exception EJSON Parser657 Error parsing data org.json.JSONException Value   pWhen Im trying the followingp  precodeprivate static String urlallvenues  http10.0.2.28080zzpullvenuesjson.php codepre  pthe code runs forever and Im getting a timeout error after about 5 minutes.p  pAny idea how to fix that so I can also test my app on my local webserver  the emulator Most probably the problem is in my local Apache configuration, but then, Im not surep  pstrongEDITstrongp  pHere is some of the code that seems to trigger the errorp  precode            DefaultHttpClient httpClient  new DefaultHttpClient             String paramString  URLEncodedUtils.formatparams, utf8             url    paramString             HttpGet httpGet  new HttpGeturl              HttpResponse httpResponse  httpClient.executehttpGet             HttpEntity httpEntity  httpResponse.getEntity             is  httpEntity.getContent codepre  purl is the one mentioned above. As mentioned in my comment below, it looks as if the problem comes from the local WAMP webserver not responding appropriately, since the code works fine when Im directly accessing the real server via the Internet i.o.w, do nothing else than changing the URL to the Internet address of the php script. The odd thing is that the script also works fine when I run it locally, but NOT through the emulator.p

Negative 529 pWhen adding a new nonnullable column to a table using code first migrations, it will automatically create a default value for you. This makes sense because existing rows need to have a value for the new column since it cant be null. Thats fine, but after that value is assigned everywhere, I dont want it anymore. Its nonnullable, because I want to make sure that a value is always explicitly inserted. If everything defaults to  or 0 then Ill have magic strings. So anyway, I can up with a solution, that Im not thrilled of, but it works.p  pAfter adding the column, I then drop the default constraint.p  precodepublic override void Up      AddColumndbo.SomeTable, NewColumn, c gt c.Intnullable false     SqlHelpers.DropDefaultConstraintdbo.SomeTable, NewColumn  codepre  p...p  precodepublic static string DropDefaultConstraintstring table, string column      return string.Format         DECLARE name sysname          SELECT name  dc.name         FROM sys.columns c         JOIN sys.defaultconstraints dc ON dc.objectid  c.defaultobjectid         WHERE c.objectid  OBJECTID0         AND c.name  1          IF name IS NOT NULL             EXECUTE ALTER TABLE 0 DROP CONSTRAINT   name         ,         table, column  codepre  pPROS Once the helper method is implemented, I just need to add one simple line to drop the constraint. CONS Seems unnecessary to create an index just to delete it.p  pAnother approach would be to alter the generated migration, so we add it has nullable, update all the values and then make it nonnullable.p  precodepublic override void Up      AddColumndbo.SomeTable, NewColumn, c gt c.Int     SqlUPDATE dbo.SomeTableSET NewColumn 1     AlterColumndbo.SomeTable, NewColumn, c gt c.Intnullable false  codepre  pPROS Seems simplercleanerp  pCONS Have to alter my constraints temporarily I assume this runs in a transaction and thus we shouldnt be allowing bad data in. The update might be slow on big tables.p  pWhich method is preferable Or is there a better way that Im missing p  pNote I have demonstrated the case where you are adding and cleaning column definitions in one go. If you are just cleaning up defaults from previous migrations, the second approach isnt helpful.p
Negative 529 p I need to generate a probability histogram of the number of rolls before a sum of 7 occurs while rolling two dice.  The experiment works properly and through 10,000 iterations I get data that looks as you would expect.  I am having lots of trouble in displaying this data in a histogram however.  The problem is that there is a large amount of extra data that seems to be printed onto the histogram that is not present in the vector that Ive passed to codehistcode.  This shows up as a large amount of infinitely large bins at large values on the xaxis.p  pSince the probability of rolling a sum of 7 is 636  16, it is typical for this to occur on one of the first few rolls.  Here i have a row vector rollbins, where the ith entry holds the frequency of the experiment requiring i rolls.  After many iterations of the experiment, rollbins has its first few elements large with each subsequent entry smaller until the 45th is usually zero.p  pIve used the codehistcode function with a bins vector argument and per a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9123238limitdatavaluesdisplayedinmatlabhistogramthisa question Ive used codexlimcode to limit the display to only 045 on the xaxis.  However the output is not limited with or without codexlimcode.p  pAny help is greatly appreciated p  pre classlangnone prettyprintoverridecodeiters  1000  do not consider extreme results maxrolls  45  rollbinsi is how many experiments occured with i rolls rollbins  zeros1, maxrolls  for r1  1  iters      roll die until get sum of 7, note times taken     sum  0      the amount of rolls the experiment takes     rolls  0     while sum  7         rolls  rolls  1          sum two rolls of a die same as one roll two dies         sum  floor 6rand1  1   floor 6rand1  1      end       assign if within the vectors limits discards outliers     if rolls lt maxrolls         rollbinsrolls  rollbinsrolls  1     end end   1,2,3...45 range  11maxrolls  limit the values on xaxis to 045 xlim[0 maxrolls]  the histogram shows more than 45 vertical bars histrollbins, range codepre  pedit the codexlimcode call should come after the codehistcode function.

From where does it comeli liInside codeloadUsercode function, when you execute codenextcode, it means that the function codeapp.getcode can continue its procedure, but this req.currentUser  user, is the same req that is used on codeapp.getcode functionli liInside codeloadUsercode function, when you execute coderes.redirectcode code, automatically breaks the procedure on codeapp.getcode function, right it looks like it doesnt return to codeDocument.findcode.li ol

Negative 529 pI am creating a static table view must be compatible with iOS 4  so I cant use iOS 5s method.p  pThe way I have it is that I have two sections the first has one cell, and the second has two cells. I made two arrays, one with the title of the only cell in the first section, and the second with both titles for both cells in the second section. So my dictionary looks like thisp  precodeNSDictionary        First               Title1       lt  Array 1 item          Second               Title1,    lt  Array 2 items         Title2          codepre  pThe issue I have is that I need to return number of rows in a section using codetableViewUITableView tableView numberOfRowsInSectionNSIntegersectioncode. So my question is, how do I retrieve the section from the dictionary using codeNSInteger sectioncode I would also have to do the same thing in codetableViewcellForRowAtIndexPathcode.p  pThank youp

Negative 529 pI have a JTree populated with some custom nodes. I have a class thats subclass of DefaultTreeCellRenderer and using that MyTreeCellRenderer i can set tooltips for each node in my tree. It works fine JTree is populated, cell renderer is set, all added nodes do have tooltips. Problem is that i dont know how to change tooltip for certain node in already populated tree... How to do that Is there any way to recreate cell renderer for just one node in JTreep
Negative 529 pI would like to acces my app from another app. For instance, i would like to, from the buildin SMSapplication, to copy some text and add the text to my database.

Negative 529 pI have an old program written in C from the 1990s.  I would like to update it so that it will work for the next persons and on modern compilers.  Currently I am using a really old version of TurboC to make changes.  Should I be focusing on rewriting this in modern C or C  Which will be the easiest to bring this code up to date without having to rewrite too much and be able to reuse most of the existing codep  pMy programming background has mostly been in hprogramming languages like Perl, Python, PHP, Powershell, and Visual Basic, so I am not too familiar with the differences between C and C. p
Negative 529 pIve been working on a game engine. It can create games in windowed mode, fullscreen mode or applet mode. The FPS is fine in applet mode and windowed mode gives me 90120 fps with upto 3000 objects in the map, but in fullscreen mode, it drops to 2550 fps. Heres the window class.p  pa hrefhttpscode.google.compgameengineforjavasourcebrowsesrccomgejcoreGWindow.java relnofollowhttpscode.google.compgameengineforjavasourcebrowsesrccomgejcoreGWindow.javaap  pCould not find where the problem is.

So setting the mode increased the fps to 6070fps but still not as much as in windowed mode.p
Negative 529 pI am a newbie with iOS and objectiveC. I am writing an app in which a user can send a message to a certain set of friends selected from a list of Facebook friends which I am able to get. p  pI would like to enable the user to easily select friends from this list  Have a To box similar to how one types in an email and email addresses with a name as what user types appears  user selects one of the email ids presses enter and then can add more similarly. This is not an email and neither will the message be sent to Facebook.p  pHow do I develop the codeUI such that it is very easy for the user to select friends from this list as one does while typing emails or sending Facebook message on iPhonep  pThanksp

Negative 529 pIm having a severe problem using the new versions of Xcode 4.4 amp 4.5 in that, my project has a very large .sql database file stored in the project. This file cannot change, for many reasons... but it is 270Mb in size. This causes Xcode to hang on Indexing File... and becomes completely slow and unresponsive to the point that I have to force quit the app, and cannot actually get any coding done. I have raised a bug report with Apple several times, but it is seemingly being ignoredp  pI do not want to disable Xcode indexing entirely as i find the code completion features incredibly useful.p  pMy question is Can i remove the database from the Xcode bundle resources, and then add it automatically at compile timep  pWould appreciate any and all advice on how I could get round this problem.p  pRegards, Samp

Negative 529 pIn my project I have a tree of QObjects with different types. Let me give you a simple example which should give you the idea of what Im talking about. This could be an exemplary QObject tree not an inheritance diagram but somewhat similar to a class diagram, where we start with the root object at the top and listing its child objects belowp  precode                                   City                                                                         Street                                                                     House       ...                                                         Floor     ...                                               Room    ... codepre  pWhile a QObject tree does not necessarily follow this rule, in my case very class in the tree has a parent of emone strongparticularstrong typeem. So, to stay at one relation as an example, a house can have some floors and children of other types, but a floor is a child of a house and emonly a houseem.p  pNow if I model these as QObject derived classes, the interface of codeclass Floorcode should give me its codeHouse housecode by internally looking what the codeQObjectparentcode is. I really know that this parent will be of type codeHousecode, because I designed it to be so and the programmers stick to this design.p  pIs it ok if I Cstyle cast the codeQObject parentcode to codeHousecode to implement codeHouse house constcodep  pQt suggests to use codeqobjectcastltHousegtparentcode, returning code0code if the codeQObject parentcode doesnt inherit from codeHousecode, making the cast typesafe. But in release mode, I want to avoid such slow casts. I profiled one particular algorithm which is performing three times faster when doing Cstyle casts instead of qobjectcasts.

Negative 529 pI have a very large fixed at runtime, around 10  30 million number of arrays. Each array is of between 0 and 128 elements that are each 6 bytes.p  pI need to store all the arrays in mmaped memory so I cant use malloc, and the arrays need to be able to grow dynamically up to 128 elements, and the arrays never shrink.p  pI implemented a naive approach of having an int array representing the state of each block of 6 bytes in the mmaped memory. A value of 0xffffffff at an offset represents the corresponding offset in the mmaped memory being free, any other value is the id of the array which is needed for defragmentation of the blocks in my current implementation, blocks cant be moved without knowing the id of their array to update other data structures. On allocation and when an array outgrows its allocation it would simply iterate until it found enough free blocks, and insert at the corresponding offset.p  pThis is what the allocation array and mmaped memory look like, kindofp  precode 0xffffffff  0xfffffff     1234        1234     0xffffffff  ...      free       free    array1234[0]array1234[1]    free     ... codepre  pbr This approach though has a memory overhead of codeoffset of furthest used block in mmaped memory x 4code 4 bytes ber int.p  pWhat better approaches are there for this specific casep  pMy ideal requirements for this arep  ul liMemory overhead any allocation tables  unused space lt 1.5 bits per element  46 bytes per arrayli liO1 allocation and growing of arraysli ul

Negative 529 pIve been developing an program of late using both g 4.6 and g 4.7. Im currently taking advantage of a lot of the c11 features.p  pI made this decision thinking that I would be able to just bundle the libs along with the program in a sub directory and use LDLIBRARYPATH. I have since discovered that this is causing my program to segfault. I probably should have tested this a little earlier on huh. It appears to be the bundled libc.so.6 that is causing it possibly others, but definitely libc. p  pIn the past I have used this technique where it has not been possible to install libs and it has worked fine, but I have never needed to include the libc and libstdc along with the program.p  pIs there a way around this problem, or am I going to have to roll back to an older c  libc  libstdc version and the nightmare of code changes that comes with it p
Negative 529 pI am attempting to create a script that allows the user to click a codedivcode element with an codeh1coded bit of text and then replace the codeh1code with a textbox and a graphic to click after editing.

It replaces the codeh1code element with a textbox. And when I click the save graphic, that works fine too, in that it returns the codeh1code.

I put an alert for s after setting it to code.valcode and it still shows the old value, even after editing. I feel like Im missing something simple, but Ive fought with it all day and need some fresh eyes to look at it for me. Thanks in advance.p

Negative 529 pNetty channels have multiple states but I am unable to find any documentation on the actual state transitions.

It appears that not all channels make all possible state transitions.p

Negative 529 pI needed to create a NSButton with both image and title but I didnt like any of the standard positioning methods in cocoa. p  pI decided to subclass the button cell and override the codeimageRectForBoundscode and codetitleRectForBoundscode to provide my custom positions. The problem is that the codetitleRectForBoundscode method gets called normally but the codeimageRectForBoundscode is not.p  pThe images in the buttons are shown normally so the cell must have a frame to draw the images I just dont know where it gets it from.p  pThe code is really simple. At the moment the only thing I did is to subclass NSButtonCell and override those two methods. Then in IB I choose an NSButton and change its cell class to my custom button cell.p  pHere is the codep  precodeimport JSButtonCell.h  implementation JSButtonCell   NSRecttitleRectForBoundsNSRecttheRect      NSLogBounds for title     NSLog,NSStringFromRecttheRect     NSRect titleRect  [super titleRectForBoundstheRect]     NSLogTitle rect     NSLog,NSStringFromRecttitleRect     return titleRect    NSRectimageRectForBoundsNSRecttheRect      NSLogBounds for image     NSLog,NSStringFromRecttheRect     NSRect imageRect  [super imageRectForBoundstheRect]     NSLogImage rect     NSLog,NSStringFromRectimageRect     imageRect.origin.y  20     return imageRect   end codepre
Negative 529 pIm learning Node.js and looking forward to create a simple web application which will be based on Express and I was thinking of something like creating user groups and each group has its own users and each group has its own permissions Just like ACL in Cakephpp  pSo can anyone recommend a good module or whatever to do so p  pAlso Im a little curious about security and how these passwords are going to be saved and what type of encryption the passwords will be encrypted in.p  pWell, This can be done manually but it will take sometime. The best approach I found is to create a role for each user and there will be the group ID so later we can assign the appropriate permissionsp  pThanks p
Negative 529 pI want to start my app with a HomeScreen that amongst some other options displays a button to choose an image and to resume editing with some image from a previous session.p  ul liButton Pickli liButton Editli ul  pWhen choosing Edit it will bring the user to an edit view, using Navigation controllers etc. fine so far When choosing Pick it will show the iOS imagePickerController etc.p  pbut, after selecting an image, I do not want to return to the HomeScreen. When the UIImagePickerController is being dismissed, it will need to uncover the Edit view, as if it had been inserted into the ViewControllers NSArray, just below the UIImagePickerController.p  pThe Back button in the Edit stage will ALWAYS bring the user back to the HomeScreen, so even if one had entered this screen through the imagePicker, it still will have to return to the HomeScreenp  pOne of the reasons that the HomeScreen needs to be the back button, is the the app will be FREE app, but at the HomeScreen will be the option to do IAP to unlock more features and more like the About etc...p  pSo... how can I tweak the order of the Navigation Controllerp  por are there better ways to go from A to B to C and back to A or from A to C and back to Ap

Negative 529 pI have the following base interfacep  precodepublic interface Value  double getValue  codepre  pI would like to have a few different codeOutputtercode interfaces that would take a Collection and output them, based on the CONCRETE type of the Value, so I could have a Value class that would have 10 other important fields, which should also be output. I know this falls nicely into a Visitor pattern, but my concern is this Each outputter would always get a list of ONE specific type of Value, SO I could, in theory, supply a typed list of MeanValue, StdDevValue etc. I am not sure how to design this nicely, as Values are generated by another interface, so in fact, I am only holding a reference to Collection, and I do not want to downcast it and then call specific method on the Outputter...p
Negative 529 pwhen I run an already developedworking in iPhone 4S app in iPhone 5 without the launch image for 4inch screen, the UI is breaking. i.e, it is not showing the letterbox viewview with a black patch on both top and bottom of the screen instead it simply shows some white patch in the bottom alone and shifts the entire UI towards top. I know about the launch image related issues, but without that it should at least show the letterbox type view. But that even is not working. May know what could be the reasonp

Negative 529 pI am using a GoogleMap v2 api inside of a Fragment inside of a ViewPager.  The original issue I was having was that the ViewPager was capturing all horizontal scrolling gestures so the map could only be dragged if the user started in the vertical or diagonal directions.  All horizontal dragging was captured by the codeViewPagercode.  I found that the solution is to create a derived codeViewPagercode class and override the codecanScrollcode method.  The View being dragged is passed to this method, so you can make a decision based on the type of View it is.p  pIn my case, my Fragment is a codeSupportMapFragmentcode from the codecom.google.android.gms.mapscode package which gives me a GoogleMap object to interact with.  However, the actual control I receive in the ViewPagers codecanScrollcode method is of type codemaps.j.bcode.  I have fixed the problem with the following code inside my custom ViewPager class.  However, I dont feel comfortable checking for this class name when I dont know anything about it.  What is maps.j.b  Is this a dynamically created class at runtime  Is it possible for the type to change in a future update of the framework  Given only the View object, is there a more robust way of checking that the drag was initiated by a map controlp  precodeOverride protected boolean canScrollView v, boolean checkV, int dx, int x, int y      ifv.getClass.getName.equalsmaps.j.b          return true          return super.canScrollv, checkV, dx, x, y  codepre

Negative 529 pI was moving a MS MVC app from one server to another and came across an odd problem. In a number of views the images and js scripts are written with wrong case for instance contentimage.png instead of Contentimage.png. The old server handled those without a problem, but the new one doesnt return them when theyre requested.p  pWhen I run the site in the browser on the server everything works fine though.p  pBoth websites are running on IIS7.5 on Windows Server 2008 R2.p  pAnyone had a similar problem and a way to solve it Is there an IIS or some WS2k8 setting that I need to check in order for those files to be returned correctlyp  pWhats more when I try to load such wrong cased file the browser can get stuck on connection was reset error and even cleaning the cache doesnt help though I can run the site in a different browser or computer. What I mean by getting stuck is being unable to load the website at all getting connection was reset error all the time.p

Negative 529 pThis is an MVC 4 app using the Hot Towel SPA template.

Negative 529 pIm reading N3485 C Standard Draft and in the section on alignment, it states the followingp  pstrong3.11 Alignment [basic.align]strongp  blockquote   p1 ...    An alignment is an implementationdefined integer value representing   the number of bytes between successive addresses at which a given object can be allocated. An object type imposes an alignment requirement on every object of that type strongstricter alignment can be requested using the alignment specifierstrong 7.6.2.p blockquote  pHere it states what alignment is, and I get that.  It means that if you have 32 bit 4byte system, it will read in 4 byte size chunks at a time, so you should place things in memory at 4 byte offset addresses. A lot of this is handled by a good compiler, however C lets you have your say in it too.p  pThe alignmentspecifier it speaks of is codealignascode.p  pYou can pass an integer to codealignascode to specify your alignment requirement or a type like codealignasdoublecodep  pNow, you have weak or strict alignment, which is stated to be the followingp  blockquote   p5 Alignments have an order from emweaker to stronger or stricterem   alignments. strongStricter alignments have larger alignment values.strong An   address that satisfies an alignment requirement also satisfies any   weaker valid alignment requirement.p      p7 Comparing alignments is meaningful and provides the obvious resultsp      p Two alignments are equal when their numeric values are equal. p      p Two alignments are different when their numeric values are not equal. p      p emWhen an alignment is larger than another it represents a stricter alignment.emp blockquote  pSo here it states that a stricter alignment is a larger alignment.  Does that just mean that codealignas8code is more strict than codealignas4code  On a 32 bit 4 byte system, the 8 version would mean that codeintcode type would require two reads instead of one, and one with just padding.  Is the strict referring to the fact that it imposes potential overhead on the CPU, when alignment is misused, as in this silly examplep  pI realize that not all alignments are valid on a given system, and that extended alignments have to be valid in order to produce correct behavior.  p  pTo me alignment is about letting the CPU access memory data in word size chunks, which is the most optimal way for a CPU to fetch and write data to and from memory.p  pThis strict alignment, as I understand it, could potentially ruin that. Am I wrong What is strict alignment vs weak alignment  p
Negative 529 pIm refactoring some code I wrote and I have to decide if I wanna put a switch statement into a  while loop or repeat the while loop into each case blocks. The two different ways are something like the following pseudocodep  pOption 1p  precodewhile cnt gt 0      switch value      case A         doSomething         break     case B         doSomethingElse         break     ...     default         default         break          cnt  codepre  pOption 2p  precodeswitch value  case A      while cnt gt 0         doSomething         cnt        case B      while cnt gt 0         doSomethingElse         cnt        ... default       while cnt gt 0         default         cnt         codepre  pI think the first option follows better the DRY principle because I dont repeat every time the while and the cnt. Although I like a bit better the second option because once it picks a case in the switch statement, it starts to loop in the while and it doesnt have to evaluate the switch condition anymore.p  pSo, which of these two solutions would you pick and why p  pNB We can assume that the switchcondition i.e. the variable value in the code below doesnt change for the entire while loop, in other words the operations doSomething, doSomethingElse etc. do not affect the switch statement.p  pNB2 In the real code Im working on, the while loop can be very huge. Cnt, for some test cases, can be of the order of 109p

Negative 529 pThe idea of the following code is that the user will search based on maintenance operation No, operation type, the member who performs the operation, or the employee whose PC needs maintenance.

Negative 529 pI havent been able to find this after scavenging the forums. I would like to implement something like this ... the main character always moves in the direction its facing. When the player touches the screen, the character will turn to face that touch location, which should cause the body to move in a different direction.p  pI can get the character to face a touch location as followsp  precodeCGPoint diff  ccpSublocation, self.position CGFloat targetAngle  atan2fdiff.y, diff.x self.bodygta  targetAngle codepre  pI want something along these lines. Get the current angle the character is facing. Turn that angle into a unit vector. Multiply that unit vector by a maxvelocity, and apply it to the character.

Negative 529 pI am developing a reasonably complex iOS Application. To rationalise development, I have begin developing each module as a standalone project, which are then composed together in the toplevel Application project, resulting in a tree of dependencies.p  pI have taken this approach successfully before, but this time around have a shared dependency C which causes a problemp  precode     A              B  C  D         C   E     C codepre  pWhere A is the toplevel Application project, and C is a Core Library of functions. This core library is a dependency of A itself, as well as modules B and D. strongThe resulting multiple complilation causes duplicate symbols in the build folder and failed linking.strongp  pNow, I can be pragmatic and just remove the reference from A, as this will be compiled into the build folder by B anyway, and if D wasnt involved, this would just work.  But how do I go about resolving the  duplication of C dependency from B and D  strongThe B and D projects still need a reference to C when I compile them standalonestrong, but there is a clash when compiled twice in the context of A.p  pI can imagine some convoluted solution using objcopy and giving them unique prefixes, but this would be somewhat inefficient as its the same code. I could live with this, but is there a better way Perhaps some compiler or linker flag to reuse an existing symbol in the build folder if one exists, instead of compiling againp  pThanks for any advice.p

Negative 529 pMy backgroundp  pIm a pretty advanced Eclipse user since 2005  IBM RSA, Europa, Ganymede, then a lovely couple years away developing on NetBeans platform, and last year I inherited an Eclipse RCP application shortly before the developer left, built on top of Juno with e4 platform using Windowbuilder to design components and dialogs out of SWT widget.  p  pMostly that has been pretty smooth.  Windowbuilder seems pretty fragile, breaking and requiring a restart or reinstall of eclipse occasionally. Worse on Windows, but it recently broke on my OSX and I decided to try with a fresh install. In the past I successfully muddled through, googled the errors, and through trialanderror eventually made it through instructions that other have provided just these 3 easy steps.p  pI have installed Juno SR2, added the e4 tooling items, and my Eclipse product Eclipse application starts up.br Windowbuilder seemed to install.

Negative 529 pI found this little gem about how to get SignalR and Rx to play nicelyp  pa hrefhttpwww.thinqlinq.comPost.aspxTitleSignalRandReactiveExtensionsareanRxforserverpushnotifications relnofollowRx and Reactive Tutorialap  pHowever as you might have noticed this only works when going from server  client. Does anyone know how to go the other way around I want my framework to be a bit more message based like NServiceBus and less RPC which signalr standard examples tend to be.p  pThe reason for this is the weakly typed world doesnt lend itself very well to RPC. On the server side Id love to be able to put interfaces around the client calls, but I cant because the client may not even be OO and has no concept of contracts and interfaces.p  pSo Im hoping to turn everything into message based, with brokers in the middle via reactive, SOA services. Hopefully Reactive and DTOs will be the only dependencies in my code.p  pSo does anyone know how this can be achievedp

But using the system codefile descriptercode and codewritecode method in codefcntl.hcode doesnt write it out properly... I can open the picture, but its very obvious that the colors are off. Please assume that the picture has valid colors when it was outputed from the decoder, because I can write directly from decoder to disk and everythings fine.

Negative 529 pI am writing my first unit tests for an Angular JS project, and Im wondering how to lay thing out in a easy to understand and maintain manner.p  pFor directives for example the examples I have found so far usually have one file for directives, with in it one describe. In my opinion that would easily become quite a big file to maintain.p  pI think it makes more sense to have a file per directive, and then in that directive have a describe for the directive itself,like this for a myDate directive, with filename myDateDirectiveSpec.js. That already makes things easier to read, but then Im still a bit concerned about directives with a lot of functions. In the example below I add comments to indicate where I test which function, but isnt there a better wayp  precodedescribemyDate, function    var compile, rootScope   var validDate, invalidDate, invalidDateFormat    beforeEachangular.mock.modulemain    beforeEachinject       [compile,rootScope, functionc, r            compile  c           rootScope  r       ]        test function validDate   itshould check if the given date is a valid date, function        validDate  3182011       expectisValidDatevalidDate.toBetrue        test function formatDate   itformat the given date, function        validDate  3182011       expectformatDatevalidDate.toBe3182011        test function anotherFunction   it...., function        validDate  3182011       expectanotherFunctionvalidDate.toBetrue        test function anotherFunction   it...., function        validDate  3182011       expectanotherFunctionvalidDate.toBetrue        test function anotherFunction   it...., function        validDate  3182011       expectanotherFunctionvalidDate.toBetrue       codepre  pIf a directive has a lot of functions in it can I somehow split them out in a smarter way then what I did in the above examplep

To do this, Im setting the codewebView.scrollView.contentInsetcode property to have a top inset of code64code.p  pHowever, this doesnt shrink the amount of area the web view wants to take up, so if a page is less than a screenful, it has 64 px of white space at the bottom to scroll through. The web views are in a vertical codeUIPageViewControllercode, so this disrupts paging. Is there some way to get rid of this extra spacep

Negative 529 pIm writing a Philosophers Dining solution in Go. My solution is simple check if both forks are available. If so, pick both up. If not, leave both be.p  pHowever, Im running into a weird concurrency error, whereby a forks availability is still true even after explicitly being set to false. My codeForkcode is declared like sop  precodetype Fork struct      mu    sync.Mutex     avail bool   func f Fork PickUp bool      f.mu.Lock     if f.avail  false          f.mu.Unlock         return false          f.avail  false     fmt.Printlnset false     f.mu.Unlock     return true   func f Fork PutDown      f.mu.Lock     f.avail  true     f.mu.Unlock  codepre  pWhen a Philosopher calls codePickUpcode, the program will wait for the mutex lock if, at that point, the fork is available, the codeForkcode sets its availability boolean to false and returns true to indicate the operation was successful. p  pThe Philosopher is written like sop  precodetype Philosopher struct      seatNum int   func phl Philosopher StartDiningforkList [9]Fork      for          fmt.PrintlnforkList[phl.seatNum], phl.seatNum         if forkList[phl.seatNum].PickUp              fmt.PrintlnPhilo , phl.seatNum,  picked up fork , phl.seatNum              if forkList[phl.getLeftSpace].PickUp                   fmt.PrintlnPhilo , phl.seatNum,  picked up fork , phl.getLeftSpace                 fmt.PrintlnPhilo , phl.seatNum,  has both forks eating...                 time.Sleep5  time.Second                  forkList[phl.seatNum].PutDown                 forkList[phl.getLeftSpace].PutDown                 fmt.PrintlnPhilo , phl.seatNum,  put down forks.              else                  forkList[phl.seatNum].PutDown                             codepre  pemNote The codegetLeftSpacecode function has been excluded because its implementation is irrelevant it simply gets the index of the leftward space.emp  pThe implementation of the codePhilosophercode is very simple it checks to see if it can get the first fork. Then, it checks to see if it can get the second fork if it cant, it puts down the first fork. If it can, it holds both for 5 seconds, then puts both down. Ive limited this to two philosophers for testing purposes.p  hr  pHowever, this isnt working properly. Philosopher 0 picks up the first fork, and then the second fork. I have verified that the availability of these forks have been set to false. By this point, Philosopher 1 is locked by the mutex. However, once Philo 0 has released the mutex, Philo 1 enters the function.p  pThe expected result at this point would be for the codePickUpcode function to return false as the fork is no longer available, it cannot be picked up. However, the function does not do this it returns true and allows Philo 1 to pick up the fork p  pEven more mysterious, by the time Philo 1 goes to pick up the fork, the availability of the fork is codetruecode, even though Philo 0 explicitly set them to false Here is my debug outputp  precode0 0 true 0                        Fork 0 is available set false                             Fork 0 has been picked up Philo  0  picked up fork  0           Repsonse from Philo 0 confirming the above 0 0 true 0                        Fork 1 is available set false                             Fork 1 has been picked up Philo  0  picked up fork  1           Response from Philo 0 confirming the above Philo  0  has both forks eating...   As Philo 0 has both forks, they can now eat...  0 0 true 1                      Philo 1 checks Fork 0s availability, which is true set false                             Philo 1 sets Fork 0s availability to false Philo  1  picked up fork  1           Response of  0 0 true 1                        set false                             Philo  1  picked up fork  2 Philo  1  has both forks eating... codepre  pPhilo 1 should never have been able to pick up the fork.

Negative 529 pI have been reading a lot about queues and have confused myself. I will just jot down what I know, please let me know, if I understand things correctly. p  pA queue basically helps you to do things out of the requestresponse cycle. Meaning, if a client uploads an image, and you want to save the thumbnail version of the image, you do not want to keep the client waiting for the time till the image gets trimmed, and then return him, you do it out of the requestresponse cycle, via a queue. Queue is almost like the traditional datastructure queue, first in first out sort of. p  pThe popular solution providers for these queues are a hrefhttpwww.celeryproject.org relnofollowcelerya, a hrefhttpsgithub.combinarydudpyres relnofollowpyresa, amp amazon sqs.p  h2How does a queue workh2  pGenerally there is a daemon running, for instance, if there is celery then there is a celery daemon which runs, and keeps doing the computation on whichever task is at the top of the queue. hope i am right on thisp  pAnother example, slightly complicated, please correct me on this. p  pNow say I want to automate the following taskp  ol lipSend a mail to a friend of mine, on 25th Dec. pli lipWish a friend on her birthday on 26th Dec.pli lipWish another friend on her birthday on 26th Dec. pli ol  pIn this case, what I will do the followingp  ol lipcreate an entry,  and  in the database.pli liponce the entry is created, queue that entry. pli lipFire a worker, which will execute that task. pli ol  pNow here is the doubt, is step 3 correct p  pIs there a long polling worker, which will act  How does this work I am confused. Or do I need to have a cron job, running, which will keep firing a script  to check if there is anything in the queue, for the given timewith the precision of minutes if yes, then fire a worker. p  pWhen you look at the documentation of celery, they need a backend  redis, mongodb, sqs etc. So if I am right, there would be a continuous process which will run as a daemon, and will keep a track of things in the queueredis, mongodb and should execute. This is the gray area. Please help.p  pThanks for your answer.p

Next, I dont have items for these Category level items, ie. Cars and People, which are just strings. I suppose I could make these emplaceholderem objects, and give them their respective collections than make properties out of them on my viewModel, but that seems slightly excessive just to get some headers... Particularly because  already exists.p  pA second option would be the a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.data.compositecollection.aspx relnofollowCompositeCollection approach, with a good examplea but Im not entirely sure it will solve my problem. For one, Ive not seen this used in a TreeView so Im not sure if it would be appropriately applied there, and I want to use TreeView to preserve the hierarchical nature of the data.p  pLastly, I attempted my own variation where in the codeHierarchicalDataTemplatecode I add a codeltTreeViewItem HeaderCars gtcode but this doesnt work, as every Car gets its own header.p  h2The Questionh2  pMain Question What is the appropriate method, through binding, to achieve the desired structure of the TreeView Thus producing a result where all cars are presented under the Cars header, People under the People Header, with the exception that people, who are in a Cars.PeopleCollection are also displayed as children of the respective Car object.p  pSecondary Question Is a common, and appropriate approach, to make a Wrapper class specifically for the TreeViewItems Is that what I should be doing As I described in Philipps Potential Solution.p  pI should also mention that given the solution as I have described here, the code compiles. The issue is that there are no headers. The next issue, is after I add people to the cars, and then attempt to strongexpandstrong the car, I receive the following error codeMust disconnect specified child from current parent Visual before attaching to new parent Visual.code Which I assume is a product of this line of code codeObservableCollectionltobjectgt childNodes  new ObservableCollectionltobjectgtcode but frankly its late and I am tired so I cant conjure up the appropriate way to do this, perhaps CompositeCollection is what I need.p

Negative 529 pIve been making an application in C which is designed to mimic the appearance and behavior of Windows Snipping Tool application. Everything is fine, except the fact that double buffering to stop the screen flickering appears slow and laggy. Its not much lag, but its enough to be noticeable especially when comparing the performance between my program and Snipping Tool. What else can I do to improve the performance and make it seem like theres no lag, like in Snipping Toolp  precode    public Image Image  get set       private Rectangle selection     private Point startPoint      public static Image Snip              using var bmp  new BitmapSystemInformation.VirtualScreen.Width, SystemInformation.VirtualScreen.Height, System.Drawing.Imaging.PixelFormat.Format32bppPArgb                      using var graphics  Graphics.FromImagebmp graphics.CopyFromScreenSystemInformation.VirtualScreen.Left, SystemInformation.VirtualScreen.Top, 0, 0, bmp.Size             using var snipper  new CaptureScreenbmp, new PointSystemInformation.VirtualScreen.Left, SystemInformation.VirtualScreen.Top                              if snipper.ShowDialog  DialogResult.OK return snipper.Image                          return null                    public CaptureScreenImage screenShot, Point startPos              InitializeComponent          Cursor  Cursors.Cross         BackgroundImage  screenShot         ShowInTaskbar  false         FormBorderStyle  FormBorderStyle.None         StartPosition  FormStartPosition.Manual         Size  screenShot.Size         Location  startPos         SetStyleControlStyles.AllPaintingInWmPaint  ControlStyles.UserPaint  ControlStyles.DoubleBuffer, true           protected override void OnMouseDownMouseEventArgs e              if e.Button  MouseButtons.Left return         startPoint  e.Location         selection  new Rectanglee.Location, new Size0, 0         Invalidate           protected override void OnMouseMoveMouseEventArgs e              if e.Button  MouseButtons.Left return         var x1  Math.Mine.X, startPoint.X         var y1  Math.Mine.Y, startPoint.Y         var x2  Math.Maxe.X, startPoint.X         var y2  Math.Maxe.Y, startPoint.Y         selection  new Rectanglex1, y1, x2  x1, y2  y1         Invalidate           protected override void OnMouseUpMouseEventArgs e              if selection.Width lt 0  selection.Height lt 0 return         Image  new Bitmapselection.Width, selection.Height         using var gr  Graphics.FromImageImage                      gr.DrawImageBackgroundImage, new Rectangle0, 0, Image.Width, Image.Height,                 selection, GraphicsUnit.Pixel                  DialogResult  DialogResult.OK           protected override void OnPaintPaintEventArgs e              using var br  new SolidBrushColor.FromArgb127, Color.White                      var x1  selection.X             var x2  selection.X  selection.Width             var y1  selection.Y             var y2  selection.Y  selection.Height              e.Graphics.FillRectanglebr, new Rectangle0, 0, x1, Height             e.Graphics.FillRectanglebr, new Rectanglex2, 0, Width  x2, Height             e.Graphics.FillRectanglebr, new Rectanglex1, 0, x2  x1, y1             e.Graphics.FillRectanglebr, new Rectanglex1, y2, x2  x1, Height  y2                  using var pen  new PenColor.Red, 1                      e.Graphics.DrawRectanglepen, selection               codepre  pI think the reason it lags this way is because the application creates a screenshot and resizes the capture window to match the dimensions of all screens.

I named the tools one where I need to dumb all of the installs DEVTOOLS and put the path value to  CUsersmyusernamedeveltools ltthis part is correct. p  pI then created an additional JAVAHOME variable with value of DEVTOOLSjdk1.6.x for the specific version. After the install I have to append the PATH variable so that the JAVAHOMEbin is added in there as well.p  pI run into 2 issuesp  p1st when I try to download JDK 1.6.x and specify path as DEVTOOLSjdk 1.6.x it says unavailable, so I just used the long form Cusersmyusernamedeveltoolsjdk1.6.x as mentioned before then it goes fine.p  p2nd after I install it I need to verify that it worked properly so I run cmd and type emjava versionem to see if its correct. It doesnt display the newly downloaded version but an older version of jdk 1.6.x. p  pSo what am I doing wrong Sorry for the length of this question, but I figured better to be detailed.

Negative 529 pIm working on porting a complex data analysis routine I prototyped in Python to C.  I used Numpy extensively throughout the Python code.  Im looking at employing the GSL in the C port since it implements all of the various numerical routines I require whereas Armadillo, Eigen, etc. only have a subset of what I need, though their APIs are closer to what I am looking for.  p  pIs there an equivalent to codenumpy.minimumcode in the GSL i.e., elementwise minimum of two matrices  This is just one example of the abstractions from Numpy that I am looking for.  Do things like this simply have to be reimplemented manually when using the GSL  I note that the GSL provides for things likep  pcodedouble gslmatrixmin const gslmatrix  mcodep  pBut that simply provides the minimum value of the entire matrix.  Regardless of elementwise comparisons, it doesnt even seem possible to report the minimum along a particular axis of a single matrix using the GSL.  That surprises me.p  pAre my expectations misplaced  p

Negative 529 pMy intent is that when a user updates its email a verification email is sent where a verification link is contained in them and the user just has to click this link to verify the email update.It is standard practice in the web.p  pThe verification link will contain a nonce which will be cross checked with one in the db and if both are same this will mean that the verification will have taken place.p  pMy question has to do with the creation of the nonce and what function I must use to create it. This a nonce where security is not a top prioritywe are not dealing with passwords here. PHP function uniqid seems a good option but I wanted to here some opinions about the matter. What function do you use to create a nonce for the email verification links.p  pI cannot reach a decision about the matter because maybe I am not aware of all the factors that come into play and which factors must determine the decision to be takenp

Negative 529 pIm starting to work with uniqueidentifiers, and Im encountering an unexpected issue.p  pFirst of all, where Id typically use SCOPEIDENTITY, this is no longer possible with a uniqueidentifier, even though in concept it still involves an autogenerated id value as a result of the default newid or newsequentialid constraint.p  pI decided to use the OUTPUT clause in the INSERT statement to output the UUID to a table variable.  Now that I think about it, the OUTPUT clause renders SCOPEIDENTITY obsolete, considering its a much clearer and more powerful way to achieve the same thing and more e.g. gain clear and direct access to multiple autogenerated columns for all inserted rows.p  pWith the use of OUTPUT, however, Im now wondering how that affects the test of rowcount that would typically follow an insert.  Will the rowcount reflect the number of rows inserted in the main statement or the number of rows inserted into the table variable by the output clausep  pYou might think it wouldnt make a difference i.e. the count should be the same either way, but it does make a difference, because the a hrefhttptechnet.microsoft.comenuslibraryms177564.aspx relnofollowdocumentationa says that the OUTPUT clause will return values and populate the table even if the insert statement fails.p  blockquote   pAn UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE statement that has an OUTPUT clause will   return rows to the client even if the statement encounters errors and   is rolled back. The result should not be used if any error occurs when   you run the statement.p blockquote  pIt does mention that rowcount in particular will always reflect the outermost statement only when using OUTPUT, but it mentions this is context of a nested query.  Since the OUTPUT clause in my case is part of the outermost statement, its unclear whether rowcount will report the number of rows inserted into the output table if the insert statement fails.p  pre classlangsql prettyprintoverridecode    declare newuuid TABLE ID uniqueidentifier     insert into Users ID, PersonID, Username, Password, Notes, Enabled     output INSERTED.UUID into newuuid         values id, personid, username, password, notes, enabled      if rowcount ltgt 1 goto fail does this reflect rows inserted into Users or newuuid  What if the insert fails, and rows are still output to newuuid codepre

Negative 529 pSo I am currently working on an older program for practice and the directions say You can create a class that represents the collection of these WordRecords, this should have an ArrayListor Vector of WordRecords and various methods to help in accessing the Records. For example a method called addWordString word, String prefix, int lineNum  would be useful. It would first check to see if the word is already in the collection if it is then just add the prefixed line number to the WordRecord in the collection, if it isnt then create a new WordRecord for this word. So Im all good with the WordRecord class and am currently working on the WordCollection class and Im stuck on the addword method.

Negative 529 pI configured opencv with codeblocks 10.05 .Im using mingw that comes with codeblocks.Each time The programs builds fine but while running it gives a console window instead of the way it should work [I was having same problem with sfml] I tried some of the solutions from internet but didnt work.Ive also configured wxwidgets with this mingw  so I didnt want to use another mingw because earlier i figured out that I cant work with two mingw in my Pc.It gives me unknown bugs. I cant understand if it builds fine then why it cant run [I mean why this console window comes each time] One thing that Ive not tried is getting another mingw because for that Ive to build everything again from source. Can it be a reason Is something wrong with codeblocks MinGW Or,there may be other problems AS,it builds fine I think something is happening at the runtime [and as it builds that means no problem with opencv] Im using windows 7 32 bit Thanks.

Negative 529 pUpdate Just tried with TeeChart 2014.10.140220 and the problem I showed in the screenshots is no longer present. I guess it was a bug in calculating  displaying the chart, which has been fixed.p  pIm writing analysis tooling using Delphi XE 32bit and strongTChart Pro v2011strong. Im developing on Windows 7 64bit with a 3.2Ghz quadcore with 8GB memory. When testing this plot for development, I have about 6GB of memory free.p  pWhat is being analyzed is a circular surface diameter of 300mm for which the height has been measured in 134 rectangular grids of 3552 points. These grids are not equally spaced, and the points within the grids are not evenly distributed, although both deviations tend to be small. Of course the grids at the edges of the circle are not complete as the edge goes right through them. The points are actually the measured values of rectangles of 1mm by 3mm yes, they overlap.p  pThe user needs to see a 2D plot x and Y axis only of a coloured circle where the colour indicates the height at each point. This should be maintained when zooming in and the center of the circle should be at codexy  00code.p  pI have tried to use several of the offered surface series, but none are capable of correctly plotting this surface strange artefacts and random interpolation occurs and all add a Z axis, which is undesired.p  pWhen I try to draw each point as a rectangle with a colour, the plotting itself takes more than a minute when you click, you want an image on screen right away, not after waiting seconds let alone minutes.p  pAs a workaround, Im currently using a codeTPointSeriescode where I colour each point. On the initial view of the chart this looks OKish, but when the you start to zoom in you will see all the points separately which is harder to see and also incorrect. Also, due to the pixel size of the points, they will overlap incorrectly.p  pIs there a way in codeTChartcode to correctly draw this surfacep  pHere is an example of what I want to get this is actually a pointseries, but the plot was made small enough to see it as a surfacep  pimg srchttpslh4.googleusercontent.comrKBU6dNAHiEUtOgq1sjoRIAAAAAAAAB9IJjSsqdcIRXQw415h380noExamplePlot1.jpg altDesired viewp  pHowever when zooming in the surface breaks into the respective points. img srchttpslh6.googleusercontent.com3SMzs21thzcUtOgq3H52PIAAAAAAAAB9E0JKpHGDifcw415h380noExamplePlot2.jpg altProblem of TPointSeriesp  pI tried using a TContourSeries as suggested using random data. When viewing the the plot in its initial state it all looks like it is ok, but when you zoom in you see holes appearing, which should not happen. I added some timing measures to show it indeed takes seconds to display plot. I typically need to display multiple plots at the same time. Zooming in requires more time than the initial displaying. This plot is created using 1 TContourSeries per grid.p  pimg srchttpslh5.googleusercontent.comc6colrbNejIUuoDBKA2oKIAAAAAAAABEhLAYkkXScw490h477noContourNormal.jpg altTContour seems OK, but it takes long to displayp  pimg srchttpslh3.googleusercontent.comVPtnJCJ5K0UuoDBOekjNIAAAAAAAABABz7bOSxF7J8w498h475noContourZoomed.jpg altZooming in on TContour shows holes in the series.p

Negative 529 pMy general question is if and how it is possible to test to see if an arbitrary object supports a given property.   For methods, this is simple. I would send a respondsToSelector message to the object and check the result.

I am building on 10.9 and deploying on 10.6.  For machines running 10.7 and later, I would like to take advantage of the user feedback provided in the drag image number and acceptable files by codeenumerateDraggingItemsWithOptions...code method and the codenumberOfValidItemsForDropcode property.p  pMy initial thought is as follows. Test the sender declared id lt NSDraggingInfo  provided to the codedraggingEnteredcode method.  If so, use the mechanisms provided in 10.7.

Negative 529 pThis post relates a technical problem encountered in a recent software project, and allows the reader to benefit from the hardearned solution to the problem.p  pstrongBackgroundstrongp  pIn my company, Im the implementer and maintainer of an internal library that uses the a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1550dochtmlboostasio.htmlBoost asio ASynchronous IO socket frameworka to achieve crossplatform data transfer over sockets.  A colleague recently came to me with the following problem her Blackberry 10 application, which linked and used my library, crashed within several seconds if the WiFi router was unceremoniously turned off during a file transfer operation.p  pEnabling builtin tracing within the library showed us that the crash was occurring when the library called the boostasiowriteboostasioiptcpsocket , boostasiobuffer function with a socket that was not valid i.e., the socket may be unusable.  Placing a trycatchboostsystemsystemerror block around the write failed to catch anything  the crash was obviously happening within Boost.p  pBecause the crash occurred only in release builds, we could not use the debugger.p  pstrongTechnical Informationstrongp  ul liThe QNX compiler, QCC, uses GNU 4.6.3li liThe version of Boost used is 1.48.0li ul  pHere is a typical command line invocation of the compilerp  precodehomefoobarbbndkhost1010238linuxx86usrbinQCC     Vgccntoarmv7le     langc     x c     DLINUX DQNX DSUPPORTLAN DUSESQLITEFORDATABASE     Wnopsabi Wnowritestrings     O3     DNDEBUG     fnostrictaliasing     fPIC     IhomefoobarLibrariesBlackBerry10boost1.48include     ...

Had the crash occurred we could have assumed the problem was not caused by our proprietary library.  Unfortunately, the crash was not reproducible, leading us to suspect our library was at fault.p  pWe wrote a lightweight tracing framework for use within Boosts ASIO header files, instrumenting functions related to the problem.  The framework outputted a string on entry and exit intofrom these functions, enabling us to trace values of variables, too.p  pUsing the tracing framework we were able to prove that the crash occurred in the boostthrowexception templated function nonrelevant ifdefd code removed.  Boost calls this function when the systemlevel write operation fails on a broken pipep  precodetemplateltclass Egt BOOSTATTRIBUTENORETURN inline void throwexception E const amp e       All boost exceptions are required to derive from stdexception,     to ensure compatibility with BOOSTNOEXCEPTIONS.     throwexceptionassertcompatibilitye     throw enablecurrentexceptionenableerrorinfoe  codepre  pInserting traces and splitting the throw statement into separate statements proved to us that the crash was occurring in the process of throwing the exception object.  In all probability, something was going very wrong with the unwinding of the stack when the exception was being thrown.p  pstrongThe Solutionstrongp  pOnce we realized it was most probably a compiler bug, rather than an applicationlevel one, we examined the compiler options used to build the library.  We ruled out a memory corruption because the Boost internal code is probably hardened and robust enough.  Once we thought that release mode optimization may be the culprit, the distance was short to the solution drop the optimization level from O3 to O2.p  pOnce we did that the crash evaporated.p  pWe have since modified the Blackberry.cmake file in the QNX toolchain to use O2 rather than the original O3p  precodeSETCMAKECFLAGSRELEASE O2 DNDEBUG SETCMAKECFLAGSRELEASE O3 DNDEBUG . . .

Negative 529 pI am transferring bytes to and reading bytes from some tag technologies NfcA, MifareUltralight, IsoDep Mifare Desfire, NfcFFeliCa LiteS and MifareClassic. These all have a transceivebyte[] function for transmitting commands. For my work it is important that i detect when a CRC error has occurd, however, the description of how the transceive function handles CRC is rather brief. The CRC is added by the transceive function and is removed when a responce is received from the tag. How can i detect when a CRC error has occurred From what i can see, the transceive functions throw two kinds of exceptions IOException and TagLostException, and it seems reasonable that a CRC error would result in a IOException, however is that the only time a IOException is thrownp  pAny help is appreciated..p

Negative 529 pI am quite new in Android and I got a really interesting project for an app. What I need is to create a metro map for two crossing metro linesroutes with their respective stations. p  pThis seems easy at this point if we consider a static layout, with a background image for the metro routes and using buttons for the stations set in a relative way on the layout.p  pThe hard part comes when the entire layout has to be zoomable, both for zoom buttons levels or pinch and zoom. This includes moving the map by drag after the zoom.p  pMaybe this question may be a bit confusing. If I havent expressed myself well this is an example of an app which does more or less the same what I wantp  pa hrefhttpsplay.google.comstoreappsdetailsidcom.mtr.mtrmobile relnofollowhttpsplay.google.comstoreappsdetailsidcom.mtr.mtrmobileap  pThis is a metro map of Hong Kong. I would like to create the same functionalities as the map on the App but in my case only for two metro lines.p  pI am not very familiar with android.graphics or OpenGL and I have been searching for a long time for answers or similar questions on internet without result.p  pI will be very grateful if anyone could explain me briefly how the map on the app was made or give me any idea on how I could achieve that.p  pThanks in advance.      p
Negative 529 pIve been coding in assembly on Linux using NASM and am now trying to learn the same for Windows. Following advanced MSDOS programming by Ray Duncan, Figure 37 lists a hello world program based on MASM which basically prints hello world using interrupt 21h.

I want to do the same using NASM on windows. p  pMost of the examples on the net use the Windows API such GetStdHandle, WriteConsoleA etc. or use C libraries such as printf.

Negative 529 pIve been trying to look for an answer to this and couldnt find anything. Maybe my approach just sucks.p  pI have a script which I want to write in such a way so that its easily extensible with modules in the future. For that reason, I have created a function in said script that will register a module basically, add a function provided by a module to a dictionary using a key provided by the module.p  pMy initial and current plan is to call that function from the module Im importing, which doesnt work, obviously. Can I somehow call that function from inside the module If not, how else can I tackle this My problem is that I have dynamic function names here and there, and I cant just call a function from a given string, so Im creating a dictionary for that exact same purpose. For simplicitys sake, though, Id rather just import all modules, and not do anything in addition to that in the main script.p

I want to be able to take the FIRST mintime occurence of an instance, and the LAST maxtime of another instance.p  pThe table A with data can look like thisp  precodearticle   regdate  status  queue  area     1111  140514       2  LO2ST  P2    1123  140321       3  INLOA  P1    1123  140321       2  LO2ST  P2    1123  140320       3  INLOA  P1    1111  140421       2  LO2ST  P2 codepre  pNow, I want to take the earlist occurence on status 3 for each article, and I want to take the latest occurence on status 2 for each article.p  pI have tried followingp  precodeSELECT    article,    select minregdate from A where status  3 and queue  INLOA as FIRSTLOA,   select maxregdate from A where status  2 and queue  LO2ST as LAST FROM A GROUP BY A codepre  pBut this just gives me the first occurence of status 3 for all records in the table, and the same with last occurence of status 2 in the table.p  pHow do I get the first and last occurence with given parameters on article levelp

Negative 529 h1TLDRh1  pCan I use Java serializationdeserialization using codeSerializablecode interface, codeObjectOutputStreamcode and codeObjectInputStreamcode classes, and probably adding codereadObjectcode and codewriteObjectcode in the classes implementing codeSerializablecode as a valid implementation for Prototype pattern or notp  h1Noteh1  pThis question strongis notstrong to discuss if using copy constructor is better than serializationdeserialization or not.p  hr  pIm aware of the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiPrototypepatternPrototype Patterna concept from Wikipedia, emphasis minep  blockquote   pThe prototype pattern is a creational design pattern in software development. It is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects. This pattern is used top      ul   lipavoid subclasses of an object creator in the client application, like the abstract factory pattern does.pli   lipstrongavoid the inherent cost of creating a new object in the standard way e.g., using the new keywordstrong when it is prohibitively expensive for a given application.pli   ul blockquote  pAnd from this QA a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq16738411065197Examples of GoF Design Patternsa, BalusC explains that prototype pattern in Java is implemented by a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavalangObject.htmlclonecodeObjectclonecodea only if the class implements a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavalangCloneable.htmlcodeCloneablecodea interface marker interface similar to codeSerializablecode to serializedeserialize objects.

Probably this also happens when unmarshalling JSON content as well.p  hr  pPeople would advise using object constructor, and I would mind that option when working with simple objects. This question is more oriented to deep copying complex objects, where I may have 5 levels of objects to clone. For examplep  precodefields is an abbreviation for primitive type and String type fields that can vary between 1 and 20 or more declared fields in the class and all of them will be filled during application execution class CustomerType      fields...   class Customer      CustomerType customerType     fields   class Product      fields   class Order      ListltProductgt productList     Customer customer     fields   class InvoiceStatus      fields   class Invoice      ListltOrdergt orderList     InvoiceStatus invoiceStatus     fields   class to communicate invoice data for external systems class InvoiceOutboundMessage      ListltInvoicegt invoice     fields  codepre  pLets say, I wantneed to copy a instance of codeInvoiceOutboundMessagecode.

Negative 529 pIm developing a multiplayer network pong game, my first game ever. The current state is, Ive running the physic engine with the same configurations on the server and the clients. The own paddle movement is predicted and get just confirmed by the authoritative server. Is a difference detected between them, I correct the position at the client by interpolation. The opponent paddle is also interpolated 200ms to 100ms in the past, because the server is broadcasting snapshots every 100ms to each client. p  pSo far it works very well, but now I have to simulate the ball and have a problem to understanding the procedure.p  pIve read Valves and many other articles about fastpaced multiplayer several times and understood their approach. Maybe I can compare my ball with their bullets, but their advantage is, the bullets are not visible. When I have to display the ball, and see my paddle in the present, the opponent in the past and the server is somewhere between it, how can I synchronize the ball over all instances and ensure, that the it got ever hit by the paddle even if the paddle is fast moving Currently my balls position is simply set by a server update, so it can happen, that the ball bounces back, even if the paddle is some pixel away because of a delayed server position.p  pUntil now Ive got no synced clock over all instances. Im sending a client step index with each update to the server. If the server did his job, he sends the snapshot with the last step index of each client back to the clients. Now Im looking for the stored position at the returned step index and compare them. Do I need a common clock to sync the ballp  pstrongEDITstrongbr Ive tried to sync a common clock for the server and all clients with a timestamp. But I think its better to use an own stepping instead of a timestamp so I dont need to calculate with the ping and so on  and the timestamp will never be exact. The physics are running 60 times per second and now I use this for keeping them synchronized. Is that a good wayp  pWhen the ball gets calculated by each client, the angle after bouncing can differ because of the different position of the paddles the opponent is 200ms in the past. When the server is sending his ball position, velocity and angle because he knows the position of each paddle and is authoritative, the ball could be in a very different position because of the different angles after bouncing because the clients receive the server data after 100ms. How is it possible to interpolate such a huge differencep

Negative 529 pI just started to develop for BlackBerry 6 and 7 and grasped the basic for programming but when testing an example that requires to change the SIM card to validate a new number I came across a problem, I cant login.p  pIm using a SIM card provided at my workplace and I dont understand the problem. I created a BlackBerry ID and tried to login, but it gives the message This is not a valid BlackBerry account. I can use this user to log in into their site and the device was connected to WiFi before I changed the SIM card so it should be connected to the Internet, the login screen doesnt give me an option to connect to Internet so I guess its connected.p  pI tried to change the SIM card back to its original but now it shows again a login screen.p  pDoes it mean that a SIM card is linked to a single BlackBerry ID p  pIm learning from a book and nothing about changing SIM cards is covered there and the BlackBerry site is offering more on developing for BlackBerry 10 so I dont know where to dig there to find a faq section or common problems with older versions.p

I dont understand how adding an array creation and extra level of indirection is going to help anything, especially because if the resulting method handle gets inlined the JVM will try to optimize out the array creation anyway.  If the combineronly args are dropped with dropArguments, the JVM should be able to prove they arent used in the target.  If for some reason the JVM cant prove the combineronly args are not used in the target and thus must keep them alive, surely the array created by asCollector will be alive and thus keep its contents alive as well.  Theyll be on the heap rather than the stack, but I dont see how that helps especially if theyre references to objects already on the heap.pli lipJava 8 added a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavalanginvokeMethodHandles.htmlcollectArgumentsjava.lang.invoke.MethodHandleintjava.lang.invoke.MethodHandle relnofollowMethodHandles.collectArgumentsa which combines foldArguments and dropArguments in the obvious way to implement collectoronly arguments.

Negative 529 pI have a Go library that provides bindings for the C a hrefhttpsgithub.comOpenImageIOoiio relnofollowOpenImageIOa library a hrefhttpsgithub.comjustinfxopenimageigo relnofollowOpenImageiGOa.

The process goes through all the steps that make the first codevagrant upcode.p  pI have noticed, however, is that the one change I made to the Vagrantfile synced folders location is persisting. Also, if I use codevagrant reloadcode, the changes seem to persist. So it looks like the problem only happens if I use codevagrant haltcode or codevagrant suspendcode followed by codevagrant upcode. But I wasnt under the impression that codevagrant haltcode and especially not codevagrant suspendcode is supposed to destroy a VM. p  pAnd when I open VirtualBox Manager I can see a bunch of instances of railsdevbox VMs that have been created.p  pI found an issue that looks like this in the Vagrant Github a hrefhttpsgithub.comfnicholchefrvmissues157 relnofollowissuesa site but honestly the discussion is totally over my head and I wasnt able to understand the resolution even though that thread is closed. p  pIf anyone knows what is causing and could explain in newbie terms or, if my problem is too opaque, could walk me through the next steps to debug, I would really appreciate itp  pstrongEDITstrong After writing this out and thinking about it more, I realized the problem is not actually that changes arent being saved. Theyre being saved...but Im just being taken to a brand new VM any time I run codevagrant upcode.p

Negative 529 ol listrongWhy do my mainmethod run infinitelystrongli listrongWhy do I get segmentation fault without ever getting into the filecheckstrongli ol  pI am currently trying to learn C, going from Java. I must say I am in total confusion but its getting better. Anyways, I have tried to make a program that reads a file and store it in a linkedlist seeing as this is something I often do, and should be able to get comfortable with a new language doing this, I hope. p  pThis, however, is not going very well atm, and I have now created a small snippet of code, which should in my head, which obviously doesnt work read a line from a file, store it in a node, add the node to the list and continue until file is empty. I also have a printmethod for the list. First and foremost I continously get segmentation fault, which I have found to appear because the program doesnt find the file, I get to this.

Negative 529 pI have a codedirectivecode in my angular code which has an inline codetemplatecode property for the sake of app load times. The template is becoming large and unwieldy so I thought about using a codetemplateUrlcode property but I want to simplify my code without slowing down the load times.p  pSo ... I was wondering if its possible to use codeGruntcode to minify a html template file and then substitute the string right into the codetemplatecode property of a directive, and with such build magic get best of both worlds ease of development and fast load times.p

Negative 529 pI am implementing a custom auditing framework, logging ETL events such as start, end, error, insertrows etc.p  pAs well as logging at a package level, Im implementing session logging where a sequence of package executions, i.e. a controller package that executes several packages, is a session. In order to keep track of the session, the stored procedures always return a SessionLogID.p  pI was hoping I could map this result set to a project parameter as otherwise, I will have to save it to a user var and then pass it around between packages via parameters. This will mean every single package will have a Package Parameter and User Variable called SessionLogID. I dont want to do this if I dont need to.p  pOpen to other suggestions.p  pThanks, Adamp

Negative 529 pIve been trying to get OpenShifts HAProxy scaling working with ny NodeJS Express 4 app its essentially a REST API, but I havent had much luck.p  pIm using loader.ios stress testing tools, with a mere 100 usersminute ramps up from 0, as Im sure at least NodeJSExpress should be able to handle that. Now granted, this does generate roughly 1020k requests in 60 seconds, but still.p  pWhat happens after the requests start pounding the server, is that I can see CPU go up, memory stays pretty solid and HAProxys log file is letting me know that its about to scale up.p  pIt never does. HAProxy crashes before it can scale, then I lose the SSH connection to the OpenShift host. It comes back after a while, though.p  pAt one point I did see that it was hitting the default 128 connection limit, then trying to spin up another gear, but since the requests kept coming in, Im guessing it just couldnt handle itp  pAt first I thought that it was due to using a small gear, as I was running top and saw that the CPU load spiked through the roof and I eventually disconnected.p  pI deleted the app and switched to small.highcpu gears which cost money per hour.p  pStill crashes when its supposed to scale up with less than 100 concurrent users.p  pThe small.highcpu gear does do something different though, because after it restarts, it adds a new gear, but it does NOT scale down even though all traffic has stopped, so I have to manually scale downp  pIf I leave the second gear up and try to stress test again with 100 users within 1 minute, HAProxy still goes down memory usage and CPU seem to be OK and I lose the SSH connection shortly afterwards. Also, this time it does NOT come up by itself. I also receive the following error in my NodeJS appp  precode [Error socket hang up] code ECONNRESET   [Error socket hang up] code ECONNRESET, sslError undefined  codepre  pIf I manually restart HAProxy after this I kinda have to since its not coming up, I can see that the localgear is down, while the second gear is up, meaning that my NodeJS app crashed on the first gear, but stayed online on the second gear.p  pIs this really intended behaviour Should I be doing something differently when dealing with NodeJS and HAProxyp  pI really cant justify paying for a service such as this, if I cant even handle 100 usersminute, since Im certain that I will eventually peak far beyond a 100.p  pstrongUPDATEstrong Heres a loader.io graphreport, which kinda shows when HAProxy is giving up a hrefhttpldr.io1tV2iwj relnofollowhttpldr.io1tV2iwjap  pstrongUPDATE 2strong I tried using Blitz instead of loader.io, just to be certain on when HAProxy goes crazy. Blitz ended up with 12k hits, 26k errors and 4k timeouts.p  pAdditionally, HAProxy went down and seemed like it would never come back up. This time I decided to wait, and after a few minutes, the localgear DID come back up.

Negative 529 pI have some custom conversion and formatting to do for certain data on multiple Telerik codeRadGridcodes throughout a web application.  Prior to using Telerik, I used the standard ASP.NET codeGridViewcode.  To do my custom conversion and formatting while using the codeGridViewcode, I derived a new class from codeBoundFieldcode and overrode the codeFormatDataValuecode and codeGetValuecode methods.  In this manner, I could intercept the value for a grid cell from the bound data source, change the value as the grid sees it, and apply my custom formatting rules.  Then whenever I needed this functionality for a particular grid column, I used my custom codeBoundFieldcode.p  pI do not see any method for the Telerik codeGridBoundColumncode to override and intercept the point at which the grid fetches data from the bound data source the equivalent to the GridViews codeBoundField.GetValuecode method.  emI need the cell data to appear to the Telerik grid to be value B for all functions  display, sorting, filtering, grouping, etc.  even though the corresponding data in the data source is value A, and I cannot alter the underlying data source in any way.emp  pCode snippets for what I was doing using the ASP.NET GridViews BoundFieldp  precodepublic class MyBoundField      BoundField      protected override string FormatDataValueobject dataValue, bool encode              if  someCondition                       return MyFormatFunctiondataValue, encode                  else                      return base.FormatDataValuedataValue, encode                    protected override object GetValueControl controlContainer               Get the data bound value.         object boundValue  base.GetValuecontrolContainer           Convert the value for the grids usage.         object convertedValue  MyConversionFunctionboundValue          return convertedValue       codepre  pUsagep  precodeltaspGridView ... gt     ltaspBoundField .... gt     ltcustomMyBoundField .... gt ltaspGridViewgt codepre  pTelerik optionp  precodepublic class MyGridBoundColumn      GridBoundColumn      protected override string FormatDataValueobject dataValue, GridItem item              if  someCondition                       return MyFormatFunctiondataValue, item                  else                      return base.FormatDataValuedataValue, item                     Override what method in order to convert the value for all grid functionality  codepre  pstrongQuestionstrong How do I do the equivalent of codeBoundField.GetValuecode with a Telerik GridBoundColumn within a RadGrid  If there is no true equivalent, what are the available optionsp

Negative 529 pIm learning Redis, and Im working with a simple codeuserscode table. Im interacting with Redis through codenoderediscode.p  pI store each new user likep  precodeclient  redis.createClient client.incrusercount, function err, reply      var newuserid  reply     client.lpushuserids, newuserid     client.hsetuser  newuserid, username, req.paramusername, redis.print     client.quit     res.redirect  codepre  pSo at this point, I expect my database to look likep  precodeuserids 1 2 codepre  pAndp  precodeuser1 username Guy One user2 username Guy Two codepre  pstrongThis works fine.strong But what Im now stuck on is generating the full table of users. I iterate over the codeuseridscode, and for each one, pull out the corresponding codeusercode hash entry.p  pThis approach, besides seeming very inefficient an individual query for each user key, is also problematic due to codenoderediscode getter calls being performed asynchronously. So each getter has to, in its success callback, call the next getter, etc. A emveryem long chain of nested callback getters.p  pThis is what I had initially triedp  precodevar usernamesList  new Array client.lrangeuserids, 0, 1, function err, reply      var userIdsList  reply  null  reply  undefined  new Array  reply     for var userId in userIdsList          usernamesList.pushclient.hgetuser  userId, username          res.renderusers,  usernames usernamesList   codepre  pBut as mentioned above, not only is it inefficient, but it emdoesnt workem, because the third parameter currently nonexistent to the codehgetcode method should actually be a callback, which should then call codehgetcode for the next item in the codeuserIdsListcode, etc.p  pThe emreturn valueem of codehgetcode is a boolean value. As a result, my method as written above simply returns an array of code[true, true]codep  pSo my questionsp  ol lipIs this the right way to performarchitect a full user list and lookuppli lipHow can it be improved to deal with the fact that each codehgetcode requires a callbackpli ol

We are using c MVC together with Web Api and on the frontend we are using Backbone.p  pMy question is will a async controllers solve our problems Or should we implement this in another way Some of you will say just cache the data and you will be fine.

Negative 529 pI am new to Android and Java.  I have been working with the MediaPlayer and AudioManager examples provided by the Android Developer and other websites.p  pWhat I have noticed is that for the call to requestAudioFocus there seems to be two separate signatures that are used. For example, from the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsmediamediaplayer.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsmediamediaplayer.htmla site there isp  precodeAudioManager audioManager  AudioManager getSystemServiceContext.AUDIOSERVICE int result  audioManager.requestAudioFocusthis, AudioManager.STREAMMUSIC,     AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUSGAIN  if result  AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUSREQUESTGRANTED       could not get audio focus.  codepre  pWith the following textp  pThe first parameter to requestAudioFocus is an AudioManager.OnAudioFocusChangeListener, whose onAudioFocusChange method is called whenever there is a change in audio focus. Therefore, you should also implement this interface on your service and activities. For example With the following codep  precodeclass MyService extends Service                 implements AudioManager.OnAudioFocusChangeListener       ....     public void onAudioFocusChangeint focusChange           Do something based on focus change...       codepre  pThen from the site a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingmanagingaudioaudiofocus.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comtrainingmanagingaudioaudiofocus.htmla there isp  precodeAudioManager am  mContext.getSystemServiceContext.AUDIOSERVICE ...   Request audio focus for playback int result  am.requestAudioFocusafChangeListener,                                   Use the music stream.                                  AudioManager.STREAMMUSIC,                                   Request permanent focus.                                  AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUSGAIN  if result  AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUSREQUESTGRANTED      am.registerMediaButtonEventReceiverRemoteControlReceiver      Start playback.  codepre  pwithp  precodeOnAudioFocusChangeListener afChangeListener  new OnAudioFocusChangeListener      public void onAudioFocusChangeint focusChange          if focusChange  AUDIOFOCUSLOSSTRANSIENT              Pause playback          else if focusChange  AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUSGAIN               Resume playback           else if focusChange  AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUSLOSS              am.unregisterMediaButtonEventReceiverRemoteControlReceiver             am.abandonAudioFocusafChangeListener              Stop playback                codepre  pIve seen this dichotomy across numerous sites giving sample code for handling changes in audio focus. My understanding is that this provides context of the applications current state. I do not understand why in some cases this is the correct parameter while in other cases a handle to a change listener is the correct parameter when calling requestAudioFocus.p  pIn fact the first example I provided states the first parameter should be an AudioManager.OnAudioFocusChangeListener.  But this is used.p  pIf you could explain why this is used instead of an AudioManager.OnAudioFocusChangeListener is used as a parameter it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance and Happy New Year Jimp

Negative 529 pIm trying to use this mutation testing tool called gruntmutationtesting, but with no success.p  pIts unclear to me from the readme file on GitHub, or npmjs how the tool recognizes the test code, versus the production code. Moreover, I dont understand what their example is doing since theres no documentation for it.p  pAny help would be appreciated. I would like to use this tool, but currently, trying to set it up is causing more pain that its probably worth.p
Negative 529 pIm making an app in Android Studio, its calling a Json and its showing the results on the map. My question is... the user will be able to choose in the previous view what he wants to search on map, for example hotel, pub, restaurant... if he choose hotel the map will display just the hotel pins, if he choose pub just the pub pins will show on map... how can I make this search on Map Activity I can show the results of all of them, but I dont know how to make per category, it will be at same Map activity Thank you very muchp
Negative 529 pIm working on a small paramedical app mainly calendar and information about the patients that will be web hosted. The app will allow multiple accounts 1 for each practitioner that wont share data. I want to protect the personal data as much as possible, especially to avoid 2 possible problems p  p1 a programming bug that may lead one practitioner to access data from someone else 2 if the complete database is stolen, I want the personal information to be safep  pI know that the firsts things are to avoid every sql or parameter injection but I want to take an extra steps because Im human and I know that just one error could lead to a real mess if the data leaks... and I really want to avoid that.p  ul liThe app is based on PHP and Mysqlli lithe app HAS TO have a way to decrypt the personal data by its own, because for example it sends in background emails and SMS to the patients to remind them their appointments.li lia practitioner often has a secretary that must be able to access the app with its own loginpassword and see the practitioners data but not all of them, only the ones related to the contact information, appointment datetime...li liof course the practitioner or secretary should be able to make a search in the database to find for example a patient by its name, phone number... even if its encrypted in the database.li ul  pSo... Im trying to figure out the best way to store, encrypt, decrypt the data. Im also a little bit scared of performance, for example a search engine on encrypted data...p  pstrongFor now here is the simplest idea I have strong 1 when a new practitioner creates an account I generate a unique key, related to the account, that will never change, and store it in the database... it will be a kind of salt 2 for every personal data, I encrypt it for example  a patients name, phone number with a key composed of two parts  one which is the same for the whole application stored in a php config file for example  the salt taken from the practitioner account.p  pThis is practical because there is no link between the practitioners password and the app, so for example no problem for the practitioners secretary to access the data, my emailSMS tasks to decrypt the data and if the practitioner looses his password which is more likely to happen than the steal of the database. I first imagined to encrypt the encryption key with the clear password of the practitioner but then its impossible to access the data with the secretary account or the schedule task. If I encrypt the encryption key with the hash of the practitioners password which is stored in the database its a lot more complicated and in fact adds zero security benefit.p  pstrongQuestions strongp  pA do you think its strong enough or am I missing something  I know that if the complete server is compromised, the data are potentially not safe if the hacker is smart enough to locate the key, write a code to decrypt all the data... but thats not exactly what I fear. And I cant find any better solution which keeps the schedule task able to decrypt the data. Do you have better suggestions p  pB how would you encryptdecrypt the text data  algorithm, key, database... Im really new to this in PHP and I fear making mistakes. I read the documentation but it lacks complete real life example from key generation to text encryptiondecryption. I fear utf8 problems, problems with key lengths what are the good practices for creating a compound key from a fixed part php config file and a variable part stored in the database ... p  pC for the search engine, how would you do  for example I want to find a person having the name starting by ABCD do I have a better way to do it than retrieving the whole list of encrypted names, decrypt php every name, put them in a list, and then still php make a search function inside that list  Do you think I should encryptdecrypt the whole data using the MySQLs AESENCRYPTAESDECRYPT functions instead p  pThanks in advancep

Now Ive come to try and connect it to my a database rather than the sample one you get with it, however whenever I add my jar file in manage drivers it doesnt display any new drivers under the drivers tab. Ive tried every jar folder Ive used in the past even as a test to see if it was just the first jar file I was trying to use was the problem. p  pDoes anyone have any idea as to what could be wrong or what I may be doing wrong Ive followed the online tutorial from eclipse and it states that the driver should display when the jar file is added.p  pIve read lots of articles online and they all say that you need to place the file in the eclipse plugin directory and it states the path Ive used it then to restart eclipse and the driver should be available, mine is not upon restart.p  pHas anyone else ever faced this issue when setting up for the first timep

Negative 529 pIn CRM Online 2013, I need to determine the start and end dates of daylight savings time based on a specific time zone.  I have code that needs to display times converted for different time zones, aside from the time zone in the current users settings.  For example, if the current users time zone is set to EST  Eastern Standard Time they will see datetime values in their local time, but I need to have a web resource on an entity form display that datetime converted to other time zones.  I can get the standard offset for each time zone but cant find any accurate data that indicates the start monthday of daylight savings time so I know when to use that offset. Using the OData service endpoint I looked at TimeZoneDefinition and TimeZoneRule entities, and also at the users current timezone in UserSettings entity.  I checked the attributes on those entities but they have incorrect values for Daylight Savings monthday.  For example, looking at EST time zone I see Daylight month and day of March 2nd, but it should be March 8.p  pI have verified that CRM itself works fine as expected, setting datetime values on a form result in the correct UTC value for standard time up through 37 and daylight savings time starting 38, but I need to access this same info from within a javascript web resource.  Any help is much appreciated.p

The reason for this is that I tried code there I literally copied and pasted and worked my way through it, and nothing happened. I think this is because in his case its a list added directly to the frame and a panel. In my case its a list in a panel and another panel added to the codeJFramecode. So like I said the code above abandon the sample found in the link. Instead what I tried to do was create the panels add them to the frame, and edit the panel I wanted changed every time a click happened by changing its name value the name value is used to get the proper file.p

Negative 529 pRecently I have been attempting to scale pixel arrays int[] in Java. I used .setRGB to add all my pixel data into the BufferedImage. BufferedImage then offers a function called .getScaledInstance. This should work great for my purposes, but I ran into a problem. .getScaledInstance returns a Image, not a BufferedImage. With an Image object, I cannot use .getRGB to add all the pixel data in int[] form from the scaled Image back into an array. Is there a way to get raw pixel data from an Image file Am I missing something I looked at other questions and did a bit of googling, and they only seemed to be wanting to get picture data in a different form of array int[][] or in bytes.

It starts from one URL, finds all URLs in that URL and then visits all other URLs, and so on...p  pI add the URLs to a string array with a predefined size and a Dictionary so I can check if the URL has already been crawled I use Dictionarys ContainsKey method because its faster than a linear array search.p  pIt is very fast when it starts working, but over time it gets painfully slow. The reason for this is that the Dictionarys Contains method takes a lot of time when the Dictionary is very big 100K URLs, for example, and that means my web crawler is slowing down quickly over time.p  pWhat can I do about this I have to check if a URL has been added already, and a Dictionary lookup is the fastest way, but even this way gets slow after the Dictionary gets large enough.p

Negative 529 pthis is my first post here so I hope my way of my problem description is fine.p  pI experienced a problem with the Highcharts implementation of the realtime data.p  pIn the Background a C Programm is running and generates all the data and puts them into a SQLite3 database which is stored locally. After about 100 entries the db gets emptied.p  pThe php file opens a DB connection, grab this data from the local database, make some preprocessing time to unixtimestamp,etc. and returns it in Json format. With JavaScript this data gets rendered with Highcharts.p  pNow to the main Problem The data gets correctly inserted in the DB but after some time completely random one timestamp xvalue gets skipped, even though it is correctly displayed in the database. So it cannot be returned correctly to Highcharts. xvaluestimestamps, yvalues difference between two measured valuesp  pBtw also in the live example of Highcharts a hrefhttpwww.highcharts.comstudiesliveserver.htm relnofollowhttpwww.highcharts.comstudiesliveserver.htma I saw that after some time one random timestamp 1second gets skipped.p  pFirst I thought that it could be because of some timeouts but I changed and modified timeouts, without any positive effect. I also thought about that there is a problem with the milliseconds but the time only gets saved in the DB as YYYYMMDD HHmmss.p  pstrongError Logstrongp  precode[Mon Apr 27 151616 2015] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] 1430140486000 [Mon Apr 27 151618 2015] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] 1430140487000 [Mon Apr 27 151619 2015] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] 1430140488000 [Mon Apr 27 151620 2015] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] 1430140489000 [Mon Apr 27 151621 2015] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] 1430140490000 [Mon Apr 27 151622 2015] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] 1430140491000 [Mon Apr 27 151623 2015] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] 1430140493000 [Mon Apr 27 151624 2015] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] 1430140494000 codepre  pThe right entries in the error log are UNIX timestamps.

Negative 529 pIn short, the question strongIs there a way to prevent Python from looking up variables outside the current scopestrongp  pDetailsp  pPython looks for variable definitions in outer scopes if they are not defined in the current scope.

My code for this is as followsp  precode    ListltIntegergt filterTypes  new ArrayListltIntegergt     filterTypes.addPlace.TYPESTREETADDRESS     AutocompleteFilter filter  AutocompleteFilter.createfilterTypes       Create and attach adapter     mAdapter  new PlaceAutocompleteAdaptercontext, android.R.layout.simplelistitem1,             mGoogleApiClient,MainActivity.CURRENTBOUNDS , filter codepre  pBut this frequently causes Error getting autocomplete prediction API call StatusstatusCodeNETWORKERROR, resolutionnullp
Negative 529 pI am trying to write a remote shell program  emulator that displays as a vt100 terminal. Ive finished writing the terminal emulator on the receiving end of the connection and tested it with ssh  everything works fine. But now Im having some difficulty writing the remote shell daemon that accepts the connection on the host computer. p  pI have initialized a pseudoterminal pty and hooked the slave side up to a bash shell successfully. However whenever the terminal goes into application mode applications like vim that dont have a prompt, it is still necessary to send a newline character before a response is received. For example, if I am in vim and type dd to delete a line, nothing happens until I press enter. Then the effects of dd and the subsequent return happen deleted line  cursor moves to next line. After debugging on the server side, I found that the master side of the pseudoterminal is getting all of the keys at the right time, but the slave side will not respond until it receives a newline. p  pMy question is How do I get immediate responses from the slave side bash program, and not have it wait to respond until a newline is received p  pSorry if I am uncleardoing something wrong. This is my first question here. p

Negative 529 pI have a project that never applies a child element to the SOAPENVHeader.  In this case, the header is just a unique id for the message contained in the body.  Because of silly legal reasons, I am not allowed to post source code snippets here, unfortunately.  The web service client is a Spring managed bean initialized as a CXF jaxwsclient in the Spring application context.  I am using Spring 3.2.14 and CXF 2.7.16 with java 7.   The web service client method accepts two parameters.  First parameter is for the soap body and the second param is for the soap header.  I know the header is never getting applied because I can see the xml of the outbound soap envelope when I enable CXF debug logging.  I also created a  CXF interceptor and added it to every phase of the lifecycle.  That interceptor simply logs the count of headers in the collection.  It logs zero for every phase.  The java classes were generated from a WSDL file and several xsd files using the maven cxfcodegenplugin.  More precisely, the message id header and soap body are well defined in the wsdl file as inputs to the service call, so I have generated java pojos to represent that info.   I have confirmed the header object has a nonnull value before I pass it into the call as the second param.  Has anyone see this issue before   Can anyone suggest a remedy or further research  p

The calculation of codecalcValuecode is based on  the filed codevaluecode in the whole table, changing it in one row can cause changes in all of the others.p  pI want to write a trigger that updates codecalcValuecode everytime there is codeinsert, delete or updatecode in the table.p  pWhat im worry about is that the trigger itself is going to have an codeUpdatecode command.

I did some research and found this article  a hrefhttpsdiscussions.apple.comthread6538068start0amptstart0 relnofollowhttpsdiscussions.apple.comthread6538068start0amptstart0ap  pSo I decided to update the device to the latest version of IOS 8.4 hoping it would fix the issue but the login still doesnt work. Ive also tested the app using a different device with a lower version of IOS 7.1.2 and it works perfectly fine there... Has anyone experienced this beforep  pIm using Ionic Framework  Cordova stack btw...p

Also I would expect to see two connecton pools instead of one.p  pQ what would be the suggestion to achive it p  pstrongUPDATEstrong I guess it is all about JoinPool based upon Implicit.glocal is built. All nested Furue will be joined to one poolp  precode What I think I see is that if we have global execution context as parentmain,  then whatever we pass as execution context to the child Future still will use global context  and still will be using ONE connection pool.  And then therefore wll have performance problem if children do not use blocking   parents will be stuck in coreslong connection pool   So Children will inherit execution context, but not blocking  and as children connectedjoined to the execution context the parents will not be able to do  anything about it but wait for the free space in the pool when child is done  new additional threads will not be creating for the next parent because i guess  Global execution context will not see the reason offor it.   Like a snapshot of the moment of time  Connection Pool [ch1, ch2, ch3, p1]   It thingsOk there is one parent p1 in the pool if one more parent  future will come I create for it new thread it the pool.  But because we have more joined children than parents in the list  the moment when Global ex context can help parent will never come. codepre  pShould then I not to use that strongglobalstrong context if I want parents to be independant on childrent and vice versa strongfunny how many people in Internet are playing with global onlystrong.p  pSay I know ma app has 20 000 clients and each of them makes 1100 sec long operations op1op1.op1 all the time. Then I just could dedicate one executon context with 20 000 connecton pool max. And as many execution context as needed for all sort of longrunning operations parentchild where child is not reportng to the parent. Say codeprintingExConcode, codelogExConcode, codereadStufExConcode, codewriteStuffExConcodep  pBut if I know that one oparation should include anoter one and they maybe joined then only I may use that global Ex context  p  pOtherwise if I would use strongglobalstrong ex context as may man context  all and everyone would join to it and I would end up having performance problem that I explained at te beginning of this Sunday post..p  pstrongUPDATEstrong  I wasted good chunk of time trying to understand why fixed version with ex passed to childPlays Futureex was producing an output that ignore sleeps and behaves weired on many other cases.

Negative 529 pI used iReport 2.0.4 and created so many reports to a Java External app. They worked finely for it. Now I use iReport 5.5 to create reports.

Then it is finely compile with the Java external app. But reports are not with validation. I validate some reports fields. 12345 to 12,345.00, but now it shows 12345.0 by the app compilation. But , although I change the language to groovy it is finely shows as 12,345.00 in the ireport preview. Result shows as 12345.0 only compile by my app.p  pI think this is course library files.I didnt use new libraries though I change ireport version. But I dont have an idea about libraries.
