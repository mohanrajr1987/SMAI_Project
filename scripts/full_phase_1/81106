Which is correct, this pod uses codeUIKeyCommandcode, present in iOS7, which would crash in iOS6.p  pThe problem is that the app crashes even when the code that uses this is commented out.

If it is present FrameA must link it and the code execute its functionality. If it is not present then FrameA continues as it does now. It must work for third parties that receive new versions of FrameA but not the bolton library. I should make as few changes to FrameA as possible since those changes will have to be maintained going forwards by another team.p  pI also need to do this within Apples submission rules, the solution must support at least iOS6, 7 and 8. So Dynamic linking is not allowed. CompanyA provides FrameA directly to the thirdparties, so the only part that Apple has to approve is the final App.p

Positive 81106 pIm using autolayout to correctly lay out some views inside a UICollectionViewCell. It works fine with iOS 8, but when I try to run it on iOS 7 or iOS 6, the cells appearance varies widely everytime they are laid out sometimes I see small changes in size and positions  one or two pixels  and sometimes big changes, resulting in some pretty messed up cells.p  pI swear I tried hard to find anyone with the same problem, but I couldnt. I didnt find any answer that could help me solve or even get close to understanding the problem either.p  pI would appreciate any inputs on how to solve or even debug this better.p  pstrongMORE INFOstrongp  pIm using Interface Builder to create the view and set up the constraints. The cells view has a total of 17 subviews, including UIViews and their subviews, and they do have a great number of constraints.p  pI update a UIColletionView which includes a table of my custom cells everytime I press a button.p  pWhat I find outrageous here is that when I run the app, everytime I press the button, the cells subviews change their positions and sizes. I never change any constraint or frame programatically.p  pAlso, the behavior is worst on iOS6. The frames chage a lot more and autolayout runs really slow it take 310 seconds to update the collection view on iPod Touch 5th Generation, even if it has only one cell.p  pWorst of all, if I keep updating the UICollectionView, sometimes XCode will complain of constraints not being simultaneously satisfied. But most of the time it works just fine.p  pIm also running into crashes in some devices when removing some of my autolayoutenabled views from superview. I found this is a strange behavior of Autolayout engine, which could get to some bad calculations due to float errors. Im wondering maybe this two problems are related.p  pAs I couldnt find any help in the entire web after searching for almost an entire day, Im starting to think this must be a stupid error with a stupid solution. I do hope so.p  pThanks in advancep  pstrongSCREENSHOTSstrongp  pIm adding some screenshots to help you visualize the problem. To get those screenshots, I run the app on iPod Touch 5th generation with iOS 6. The behavior is different on iPhone 4 with iOS 7 it behaves much better, but I still get the elements moving around some pixels.p  pEverytime I press the Update button, I remove the view which contains the UICollectionView from its superview the entire screen and add it again. I do not destroy this view, it is created only once. I thought that could be the origin of the problem some autolayout calculation buffer holding values from previous layout, but destroying it didnt solve the problem altough it did make the displacements less frequent and disturbing, but at the cost of performance.p  pThis is the expected behavior. This is the view I get when the app openp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comronOo.png altThis is the expected behavior. This is the view I get when the app open. Misplaced views.

If I keep pressing the button, I get layouts alternating between screenshots 3 and 4 or at least they look pretty like the same.p  pstrongIM GIVING UP AUTOLAYOUT AND HERE IS WHYstrongp  pWell, Im really giving up using auto layout. Ive spent almost a week learning to do a lot of thing with it specially laying out and animating views. I thought it is a wonderful and powerful feature and I learned to love it. But then I needed to support iOS6 and iOS7.p  pI found it only works great on iOS8 with any device, old or not. I dont know if Im doing something really stupid, because I cant find any threads on the internet talking about three killing problems Ive been facing.p  pIll list them here just in case somebody come across this thread sometime in the future with the same problem or with a solution. They are listed ordered by the priority I gave to them to why Im giving up autolayout.p  pstrong1 Performancestrongp  pAutolayout runs really slow on iOS6 and a little slow on iOS7 compared to iOS8  remember Im developing with XCode 6.2 and iOS8.2 SDK. The same hardware with iOS8 runs the same code just fine.p  pTo get to this conclusion, I ran my app in two iPod Touch 5, one with iOS6 and the other with iOS8. The difference in performance was pretty clear. Loading or dismissing a simple view 11 subviews in iOS6 could take more than 5 seconds on iOS 8, never took more than 1. On iPhone 4 with iOS7, the same code performed much better than in iOS6, but slower than in iOS8.p  pIm sure it is an autolayout related problem because, using the same code, I disabled autolayout and size classes for some specific XIBs and they runned stupendously fast on iOS6, while the other views kept being slow emif you are going to try this, remember to delete the old app, clean the project and build it again, or it will still use autolayoutem.p  pstrong2 Random crashes on specific devices with iOS6 or 7 when dismissing a view controller or removing a view from its superviewstrongp  pThe problem is clearly stated a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17688370autolayoutremovefromsuperviewremoveconstraintsthrowsexceptionandcrashes2728407127284071herea. It seems Im bumping into the float error problem, because I can see some e08 numbers on the crash log.p  pThis is a serious problem for autolayout adoption. Its a random, unpredictable  but reproducible  crash. The same layout constraint can work in various devices, with different iOS versions. But it can also crash in some of them. Example I had a view that worked fine on iPhone 4 iOS7 and that crashed when dismissed on iPad Air same iOS. The solution Change the constraints items relation fromp  pstrongx.width  y.widht0.8  0strongp  ptop  pstrongy.width  x.widht1.25  0strongp  pwhich is equivalent matematically, but avoided the crash.p  pI searched a lot if anybody had a way to know when this crash could happen or how to tackle it down forever, so I could make my views without having to worry about testing them on every device, with every iOS version, to make sure it wouldnt crash. I couldnt find a away to fix it.p  pThis crash doesnt seem to happen in iOS8.p  pPS I tried removing the constraints from all my subviews before removing the view from superview, but then the crash occurred when removing one constraint. I couldnt find any good reason to why it was crashing when removed.p  pstrong3 The problem I describe in the first part of this questionstrongp  pIts a third priority problem because I could solve this designing the cells without autolayout. This would be a minor problem if the rest of the app do not use cells, which is the case.p  pBut it is still a problem I cannot understand nor solve with autolayout. When I remove autolayout, the cells are displayed just fine. And they do work fine on iOS8 and I double checked if I was using some specific iOS8 feature and Im not.p  pstrongBOTTOM LINEstrongp  pIm giving up autolayout while I have to support both iOS6 and 7 or until I can find a way to fix at least the first two problems I listed above.p  pIve tasted the power of Autolayout and I really like it, but I cant develop worrying about unpredictable crashes hidden on some mysterious dismiss in a specific hardware with a specific iOS version. Nor can I accept the poor performance of iOS6 sometime soon we should drop support to iOS6, though, so this will be a lost problem.p

The system runs fine when volume is low, but when the number of requests becomes high, the system starts rejecting incoming requests with the above exception message. Once the problem appears, very few requests actually make it through and get processed normally, about 2 in every 30. The vast majority of requests fail, until a SQL Server restart or IIS reset is performed. The system then start processing requests normally, and after some time it starts throwing the same error.p  pThe error occurs when a data adapter runs the Fill method against a SELECT statement, to populate a stronglytyped dataset. It appears that the dataset does not like the data it is given and throws this exception. This error occurs on various SELECT statements, acting on different tables. p  pI have regenerated the dataset and checked the relevant constraints, as well as the table from which the data is read. Both the dataset definition and the data in the table are fine. p  pAdmittedly, the hardware running strongembothemstrong the web app and SQL Server 2000 is seriously outdated, considering the numbers of incoming requests it currently receives.

So now Im wondering whether this error is a result of the hardware limitations of the system. Is it possible for SQL Server to somehow mess up the data its supposed to pass to the dataset, resulting in constraint violation due to, say, data typelength mismatch p  pI tried accessing the RowError messages of the data rows in the retrieved dataset tables but I kept getting empty strings.

Negative 81106 pA little bit of background Im building an inverted index for a search engine. I was originally using PHP, but because of the amount of times I needed to write to disk, I wanted to make a threaded indexer.p  pTheres a problem with that because PHP is not thread safe. I then tried Java, but I ended up with at least 20 try catch blocks because of the JSON data structure I was using and working with files. The code was just too big and ugly.p  pThen I figured I should pick up some Python because its flexible like PHP but also thread safe. Though Im open to all criticism, what Id like to learn is the shortcuts that the Python languagelibrary provides that I skipped over. This is a PHPafide Python script because all I really did was translate the PHP script line by line to what I thought was its Python equivalent.p  pa hrefhttppastebin.comxrg7rf9w relnofollowhttppastebin.comxrg7rf9wap

Negative 81106 pI have a Problem which confuses me a little bit, resp. where I dont have any idea about what it could be.p  pThe System Im using is Windows Vista, IIS 7.0, VS2008, Windows Software Factory, Entity Framework, WCF. The Binding for all Webservices is wshttpbinding.p  pIm using a Webservice hosted in IIS. This Webservice usescalls another Webservice also installed in the IIS. If I use a client calling the first Webservice which calls the second Webservice it works fine for about 410 Times. And then it is repeatable to get this Problem, but sometimes it happens after 4, sometimes after 10 Time, but it always will happen, the Service and the IIS gets stuck. p  pStuck means, that this Webservice isnt callable anymore and generates an timeout after 1 minute.  Even increasing Timeout doesnt change anything. p  pIf i try to restart the IIS I get an timeout error and this is really confusing me. It seems that the Webservice has crashed somehow and blocks the Restart of the IIS. So the IIS is also stuck it is not really stuck, but I cant restart it. Only if I kill the w3wp.exe IIS is restartable and the Webservice will work again until i again call this service several times.p  pThe logfiles im no expert in things like logging or where to findenable such logs, so to say  im a newbie like httplogging, Event Viewer or WCFMessage Logging dont show any hints upon the source of the problem.p  pI dont have this problem when Im using a Webservice which doesnt call another Service. Calling a Webservice is done by Service Reference Im using no ProxyClasses, but I think this should be no Problem.p  pI have no idea of what is happening, nor how to solve this Problem.p  pRegards Renep  pEdit.  I hope my posting is more readable now p

Negative 81106 pI have a piece of PHP code that loops through to display all the banners that are stored in a database.

Negative 81106 pOk, so everyone knows that raw pointers should be avoided like the plague and to prefer smart pointers, but does this advice apply when implementing a container  This is what I am trying to accomplishp  precodetemplatelttypename Tgt class AVLTreeNode  public     T data     uniqueptrltAVLTreeNodeltTgtgt left, right     int height  codepre  pUniqueptr can make container functions more cumbersome to write because I cant have multiple raw pointers temporarily pointing to the same object in a way that is elegant.

Negative 81106 pI was having a discussion on twitter about adding the ability of Ruby to use codecode instead of codelambdacode, and more generally about Unicode support.  I realized that all the languages I know work only with English reserved words and mostly assume a usen keyboard for example using  instead of  or .  While some languages are now starting to have some support for Unicode in there string functions, there are still so many convention based on English or the Latin style character set.  For example Ruby requires class names begin with an upper case letter, but upper and lower case is not a property of glyphs in most scripts.p  pSo the question is Are there programming languages that work in a large set of languages, and how do they do itp

Negative 81106 pIm doing a game with game loop and active rendering using SurfaceView and SurfaceHolder.Callback.p  pIm wondering how to make that work together with timed events and touch event management. The timed events are like each xx ms something happens, each yy ms something different happens. Touch management is update game and screen when down, up, and move.p  pI have made a few tries, but it looks somehow awkward and the game isnt performing very well..p  pOn one side I have a classic game loop in separate thread while running update, render, draw, sleep a bitp  pNow I didnt know well how to make this work with timer loops. I used handler approach  make classes which extend handler, do what they have to do in handleMessage, and call then themselves with sendMessageDelayed.p  pThey just update game state. The rendering of the resulting changes would be done in the gameLoop.p  pThis approach needs synchronization for update of gameloop not intefering with update of the timers.p  pAnd  besides of this I need to handle touch events  down, up, and move My approach here was, like in the timers, just update game state, and leave it to the loop to handle and display correctly.p  pI dont know if Im maybe on the completly wrong path, noob to Androd, and made it just like i thought could work.p  pFor example Im not sure if its necessary to make a game loop in a separate thread. I thought it was, to show the results of touch handling move according to certain framerate.p  pOn the other side I could leave the loop and just tell to draw after each timer update, and after each touch handling, but this doesnt work well either.p  pThe question is whats the general approach for this kind of game timed loops  touch event move which has to render to screen continuosly.p  pThanks in advance.p

Negative 81106 pSo I know STI is the most reviled thing ever but I have an instance where I think it might actually make sense.  My app is parsing a bunch of different types of xml files.  Every file model stores the exact same information.  Just some info about what user it is associated with, when it was uploaded, and where it is stored on S3.  p  pAfter the xml file gets stored then I parse it for information which I use to create various other models.  Each type of file is going to create different things.  It is possible there could be 100 or more different types of xml files although I dont think Im going to write parsers for that many.  Does STI make sense in this casep  pThe downside I guess is models are all in one directory so it is going to flood that directory unless hack Rails and stick it in a subdir in models dir.p  pThe other option is I have a kind field and put something in the lib directory that handles all this.  Or Im using resque, maybe every xml file parser should be its own job. There are drawbacks to that though like it being kind of awkward to force a job in the rails console.p

Negative 81106 pI have two WARs deployed to the same Tomcat 7 instance, and both use CXF  WSS4J. The two apps communicate via SOAP, and WSS4J interceptors handle SAML assertions in the SOAP headers.

It also helps to launch both apps from the same Tomcat instance in development.

Negative 81106 pI am using the mktimestruct tm function in Suse 10. p  pNow, I am noticing some strange behaviour when daylight saving time is enabled. Lets say I have enabled daylight saving time to begin on Sep 15 at 1810 and the daylight correction is for 30 minutes. Now, when I call mktime with tm structure having the date as Sep 15 1810 and tmisdst is set to 0, then I get back the same values in the tm structure only with the tmisdst set to 1.p  pBut, if the pass the date as Sep 15 1810 with tmisdst set to 1, then I find the time changed to 1740. This correction in the tm structure is noticed for time passed between Sep 15 1810 to Sep 15 1840, but after that no correction in time happens and teh dst flag remains enabled. Even if I pass the date as Sep 16 1810, no time correction happens only dst flag remains enabled.p  pI am totally confused. Is this the correct behavior of mktimep

However, the problem starts when i try to serve my static files css, javascript and images from a subdomain instead of the naked domain. The flexie.js file is loaded in ie, however it doesnt seem to do anything when i serve static content through subdomain. As soon as i change my config to use naked domain for serving the page, flexie.js renders the page appropriately.

Negative 81106 h3The Storyh3  pThere is a writer thread, periodically gathering data from somewhere in realtime, but that doesnt matter much in the question. There are many readers then reading from these data. The usual solution for this is with two readerwriters lock and two buffers like thisp  precodeWriter case 1 acquire lock 0                         loop     write to current buffer     acquire other lock     free this lock     swap buffers     wait for next period codepre  pOrp  precodeWriter case 2 acquire lock 0                         loop     acquire other lock     free this lock     swap buffers     write to current buffer     wait for next period codepre  h3The Problemh3  pIn both methods, if the emacquire other lockem operation fails, no swap is done and writer would overwrite its previous data because writer is realtime, it cant wait for readers So in this case, all readers would lose that frame of data.p  pThis is not such a big deal though, the readers are my own code and they are short, so with double buffer, this problem is solved, and if there was a problem I could make it triple buffer or more.p  pThe problem is the delay that I want to minimize. Imagine case 1p  precodewriter writes to buffer0                reader is reading buffer1 writer cant acquire lock1              because reader is still reading buffer1                                                                                reader finishes reading,  writer waiting for next period      lt this point   writer wakes up, and again writes to buffer0 codepre  pAt this point, other readers in theory could have read data of codebuffer0code if only the writer could do the swap after the reader finishes instead of waiting for its next period. What happened in this case is that just because one reader was a bit late, all readers missed one frame of data, while the problem could have been totally avoided.p  pCase 2 is similarp  precodewriter writes to buffer0                reader is idle                                                                                reader finishes reading,  writer waiting for next period                                         reader starts reading buffer1 writer wakes up                          it cant acquire lock0                  because reader is still reading buffer1 overwrites buffer0 codepre  pI tried mixing the solutions, so the writer tries swapping buffers immediately after writing, and if not possible, just after waking up in the next period. So something like thisp  precodeWriter case 3 acquire lock 0                         loop     if last buffer swap failed         acquire other lock         free this lock         swap buffers     write to current buffer     acquire other lock     free this lock     swap buffers     wait for next period codepre  pNow the problem with delay still holdsp  precodewriter writes to buffer0                reader is reading buffer1 writer cant acquire lock1              because reader is still reading buffer1                                                                                reader finishes reading,  writer waiting for next period      lt this point   writer wakes up swaps buffers writes to buffer1 codepre  pAgain at this point, all the readers could start reading codebuffer0code, which is a short delay after codebuffer0code has been written, but instead they have to wait until the next period of the writer.p  h3The Questionh3  pThe question is, how do I handle this If I want the writer to execute precisely at desired period, it needs to wait for the period using RTAI function and I cant do it likep  precodeWriter case 4 acquire lock 0                         loop     write to current buffer     loop a few times or until the buffer has been swapped         sleep a little         acquire other lock         free this lock         swap buffers     wait for next period codepre  pThis introduces jitter. because the few times could happen to become longer than the wait for next period so the writer might miss the start of its period.p  pJust to be more clear, heres what I want to happenp  precodewriter writes to buffer0                reader is reading buffer1                                                                                reader finishes reading,  writer waiting for next period      As soon as all readers finish reading,                                          the buffer is swapped                                        readers start reading buffer0 writer wakes up                          writes to buffer1 codepre  h3What I Found Alreadyh3  pI found a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiReadcopyupdate relnofollowreadcopyupdatea which as far as I understood keeps allocating memory for buffers and frees them until the readers are done with them, which is impossible for me for many reasons. One, the threads are shared between kernel and user space. Second, with RTAI, you cant allocate memory in a realtime thread because then your thread would be calling Linuxs system calls and hence break the realtimeitivity Not to mention using Linuxs own RCU implementation is useless due to the same reasonsp  pI also thought about having an extra thread that at a higher frequency tries swapping buffers, but that doesnt sound like such a good idea. First, it would itself need to synchronize with the writer, and second, well I have many of these writerreaders working in different parts in parallel and one extra thread for each writer just seems too much. One thread for all writers seems very complicated regarding synchronization with each writer.p

Negative 81106 pMy friend is facing an issue where in he has a Swing Dialog and it has several text fields, combo boxes and radio buttons. Also it has a codeJPanelcode which holds the search results if at all the user wants to perform any search.p  pIt looks fine with normal font size. But once the font size is increased to say 150 or even 200, then the text boxes are not growing and the text in them is growing. So, they are not fitting in and are getting cliped.p  pHe managed to overcome this limitation by using the codesetPreferredSizecode method on the UI components. Now it seems that he is able to control the behaviour in case of text boxes, combo boxes etc. But the search panel is still an issue.p  pCould some one please point out what the issue could bep  pUPDATE They also have a JTable where the search results are displayed. Now, the thing is, they are hardcoding the height of each row in that JTable using the call setRowHeight. And due to this, if the font size is increased, the row height still remains the same. Is there any method call that resolves this. We honestly think that they should not have done that hardcoding. Is there any solution for this Please share.p  pThanks, Pavan.p

Negative 81106 pIm developing a client which will receive the [EEG] data over tcp and write it to the ring buffer. I thought it can be very convenient to have the buffer as a ctypes or numpy array because its possible to create a numpy view to any location of such buffer and readwriteprocess the data without any copying operations. Or is it a bad idea in generalp  pHowever, I dont see how to implement a circular buffer of a fixed size this way. Suppose I have created a buffer object which is contiguous in memory. What is the best way to write the data when the end of the buffer is reachedp  pOne possible way is to start overwriting the already old bytes from the begining when the write pointer reaches the end of the buffer array. Near the boundaries, however, the numpy view of some chunk for processing cant be created or can it in this case, because some of it can still be located in the end of the buffer array while another already in its begining.

Negative 81106 pI have a question about the push notification service of the Windows Phone 7 device  I can now send a push notification, using a web application to a phone, changing the data of the tile. But the problem is when I start the app, I need to display the URI in the debugger output, and then copypaste it inside the web application, which in turn will contact the MPNS, which is fine for an update, once to a single phone. But I want to create a webservice that can make multiple calls automatically, retrieve the URI of the application  which changes after closingandopening the app, I think  and send a push notification to it. But I havent found an MSDN  topic that deals with this. They just use commends, saying  to be replaced later with the URI needed. So my question is how do I use the phone to send such a message to the webservice, respond to it, and connect to the phone again, handling such request  and also do I need an authenticated webservice, or is there a debug versionp  pThis is what I have thus far  p  precode   ltsummarygt      Setup a connection with a webservice, in order to update a shell, either a toast or a tile shell.      ltsummarygt      ltparam nameshellTypegtThe type of shell you wish to updateltparamgt     public void SetupShellChannel  ShellBindType shellType               holds the push notification that is created. Since we can only have one notification channel open at any one time,          we will need to check for existance. That is why, the channelName shouldnt be changed         HttpNotificationChannel httpChannel  HttpNotificationChannel.Find channelName           if the httpChannel was not found  read does not exist          if  httpChannel  null                       httpChannel  new HttpNotificationChannel channelName               httpChannel.Open               because there is more than one shelltype we can open, we will use a switch to call the method we seek             BindToShell httpChannel, shellType                       Only one push notification service is allowed per application, so we cannot send a tile notification, as well as              a toast message notification. When we attempt this, we get a InvalidOperationException         else                       in this case, the httpChannel did already exist, but the problem is, we cannot just add the eventHandlers,              because there is the danger that it didnt exist, and we would get a null pointer exception.             httpChannel.ChannelUriUpdated  new EventHandlerltNotificationChannelUriEventArgsgt httpChannelChannelUriUpdated              httpChannel.ErrorOccurred  new EventHandlerltNotificationChannelErrorEventArgsgt httpChannelErrorOccurred               For testing purposes, we now display the URI to the user, and as output.

Negative 81106 pProblem details. Lets assume we have some InnoDB table and this table contains some records. My question is how would you implement the delete operation, having in mind some form of operation logging I quoted delete because there are some flavors to itp  ol liThe delete operation should use a codeDELETE FROM tablex WHERE...code. This works great with foreign keys constraints. But how can one keep a track of this operation by that i mean some form of database logging operation. If the deleted records are inserted in a secondary database or a different table on the same database would be a good ideali liAnother idea would be to have a column, lets say codevalidcode with possible values 1 for activevalid and 0 for deleted records. A delete operation will simply set the value on this column to 0, and the business logic does not consider it anymore. Logging would be done on the same database, by preserving all the records. This approach will have to make heavy use of triggers to perform additional tasks, like updating records from another table, based on the foreign keys.li ol  pFeel free to add additional methods for accomplish this task, if you have them. Also, if well decide that variant 1 works best, is it possible in the same transaction started from java code to perform both codeDELETE FROM database1.tablecode and codeINSERT into database2.tablecode I honestly didnt tried this, but i dont think it will work. I just dont wanna end up with deleted rows from first database and missing rows from the 2nd. If not possible, but still 1 the best option, moving the data from table1 to table2 by deleting records from table1 and inserting them into table2 in the same transaction is a good practicep  pPlease have in mind MySQL server builtin checks that keep the database integrity and the fact that the solution will have to solve the logging problem also when answering my questionpropose a solution.p

Negative 81106 pI have several devices smartphones and tablets... but some of them have the value scaledDensity set in 1.5 You can get this value using the DisplayMetrics class.

In fact, all the fonts in the device are scaled up...p  pWell... the questions arep  pWhy a manufacturer would want to do that thing... p  pHow can I set my fonts to use a scaled density of 1.0p  pThanksp

Negative 81106 pI am working with a fairly old web app that uses MySQL as the database. 90 of the tables are MyISAM, they have no indexes on their foreign keys for the most part.p  pI was considering porting the whole thing over to InnoDB so I can apply foreign key constraints and the like. However as the application is old and a bit gangly its been relying on code to enforce referential integrity and I fear that making this change in the database could result in multiple code failures. I dont have time to go through the whole code base and ensure that everything does what it is supposed to, I have no reason to suspect that it doesnt Im just aware of the possibility of adding foreign key constraints causing unforeseen issues.p  pI was thinking another approach could be to simply add indexes on the foreign key fields without creating constraints. Im thinking this would improve performance without the risk of damaging existing functionality. Could anyone tell me if there is a reason not to do this Would I receive the same performance boost doing this as I would adding indexes AND foreign key constraints p

The intended behavior is to wait 3 seconds from the end of codeapplicationDidFinishLaunchingWithOptionscode to perform a selector that runs in a background queue. p  pI havent experienced any crashes on my test devices, but I have user crash reports of uncaught SIGBUS signals, the cause being a BUSADRALN exception.

Negative 81106 pI have an app that lets you download modules that can expand your app usage.br When the user downloads a module, I fetch a ZIP file from a server and extract it to his Caches folder.

Negative 81106 pI want to consume .Net WS from IBM WebSphere.p  pI created a WSclient with JAXWS IBM implementation that consumes a .Net WS on IIS. The client is on SUSE and the authentication is by NTLM with Windows Server 2003 Active Directory.p  ul lipIf the client is executed in command line the implementation calls java.net.Authenticator to get the credentials and the request is succesful.pli lipIf the client is executed inside RAD the Authenticator is not called and it fails with 401.pli lipIf the client is executed inside WebSphere the Authenticator is not called and it fails with 401.pli lipIf I create an HttpConnection directly to the .Net WS URL the Authenticator is called and the request is succesful.pli lipIf instead of JAXWS IBM implementation I use the Axis2 directly, not IBM Axis2 JAXWS implementation I could pass to the Axis2 client the Authenticator object and the request is succesful. This only works for NTLM protocol with Windows Server 2003. When we migrate to Windows Server 2008 the auth protocol is NTLMv2 everybody is moving to NTLMv2 because security issues with NTLM and the request fails because NTLMv2 is not supported by the HTTP Client 3.X that is the dependency of Axis2.

Negative 81106 pIm a newbie programmer, but I already saw some things that can be done better or at least differently. For example, classes are made available to create new objects, like thisp  precodevar newObject  new classNameparams codepre  pBut is this really necessary, since functions can return an object I mean, with the following code you could as well get rid of the emnewem keywordp  precodevar newFruit  function confobj    var instance      Common to all fruits   instance.edible  true    Custom settings   instance.color  confObj.color   instance.shape  confObj.shape   instance.sweetness  confObj.sweetness   if instance.sweetness gt 0      instance.sweet  true    else      instance.sweet  false       return instance   var banana  newFruit   color yellow,   shape long,   sweetness 8  codepre  pSo, what do would be the advantages of using JS classes that require the emnewem keyword instead of using code like that provided in the examplep

Negative 81106 pI am adding codeJPanelcode to codeJFramecode on a codeJButtoncode click. It adds the codeJPanelcode to the frame. The button will keep on adding the codeJPanelcode to codeJFramecode on click event. There are no limitations. I am adding the codeJPanelscode to a codeListcode as well when a button is clicked. I did this because of adding the codeMouseMotionListenercode using for loop to handle Dragging of JPanels. p  pThe problem which I am facing now is with the drag.

Negative 81106 pI have a problem with Devise in production mode. Everything works fine in development users can subscribe, log in and log out without problems.

Negative 81106 pI am developing an application in which I continuously receive messages. I am storing these messages in an inmemory data structure say List. I want to write those messages to a file but only after list size reaches some threshold value say 100 messages perform batch processing on the messages. One way is I can simply check the list size after every message is received and call a function to write messages to a file if Threshold value is reached. But the problem with this approach is p  ol liCalling function may need to wait indefinitely until all the messages are written to the fileli liThe incoming messages may be lost in the process or might need to wait for getting stored in the List.   li ol  pOther way could be to spawn a new thread, which will write messages to a file independently. But when I pass the list containing messages to the thread for performing write operation, it gets updated with new messages which are continuously coming in. As a result newly arrived messages also gets written to the file which is not expected.p  pThis should not happen as I am intending the new messages to be written in the next batch.p  pCan someone suggest me a solution for this requirement, or any improvements in the above approach that can solve my issues. p

Say I have a binary tree that looks something like the followingp  precode        8                    1  0   0                4    12                 2  1   2              2   6 10 14               4  2   8                                                                           10 codepre  pI want to find the depth of each node and add those numbers all together to get a total. The code Ive got right now looks something like thisp  precodeprivate int totalDepthNode node, int depth       ifnode  null               return 0           return totalDepthnode.left, depth  1  totalDepthnode.right, depth  1  codepre  pI figured this would recursively add one to each level deeper for the left side of the the tree 8  4  2 before traversing the right side, but it doesnt quite work.p  pIve tweaked this method any number of ways but cant seem to nail down what Im missing. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.p

Negative 81106 pIm developing an android app was about to use a switch with string argument, i am making sure it is ok to let the compiler do as it suggested and change whatever needs to be changed, by ok i mean wont effect the runnability of my app...p  pthanks in advance...p
Negative 81106 pMy application is required to switch back to the previous running apps and I used the following code.p  precodeRunningTaskInfo currentTask  mRunningTasks.getappIndex String packageName  currentTask.topActivity.getPackageName String className  currentTask.topActivity.getClassName  ...  try      mContext.startActivitynew Intent.setClassName     packageName, className.addFlagsIntent.FLAGACTIVITYNEWTASK  catch java.lang.SecurityException e      Intent launchIntent  mContext.getPackageManager         .getLaunchIntentForPackagepackageName     mContext.startActivitylaunchIntent  codepre  pcodemContextcode is the current codeServicecode.p  pThis code does allow me to switch to the previous running application but it always go back to the first activity. For example, my previous running application was GMAIL, and I was on the [Email content] page. When I used my code to navigate to GMAIL, it puts me back to the [Email list] page.p  pWhat I want is go back to whatever I was doing in that application. The builtin Android Task Manager [by long pressing HOME] can redirect to the previous application without change the pageactivity. Could anyone help me fix this problem Thanksp

Negative 81106 pI have written an in place mergesort algorithm for sorting a large set of data of random size 100,000 elements or more. I was thinking about putting in insertion sort for when the data is  almost sorted to make the algorithm run a little bit faster. I was wondering if this is possible with in place mergesortp  pHere is some of my code.p  precodepublic static void mergeArrayListltStringgt list, int low, int high     if low lt high          int mid  low  high  2         mergelist, low, mid         mergelist, mid  1, high         mergeSortlist, low, mid, high         public static void mergeSortArrayListltStringgt list, int first, int mid,         int last      int left  first     int right  mid  1     String holder         if mid lt mid1 skip merge     if compareTolist.getmid, list.getright lt 0          return           while left lt mid ampamp right lt last           if left index lt right index then just add to left         if compareTolist.getleft, list.getright lt 0              left          else              holder  list.getright             copyListlist, left, right  leftmoves everything from left to rightleft                       up one index in the arraylist             list.setleft, holder              left             mid             right                    what is left is in place    public static void copyListArrayListltStringgt source, int srcPos, int length      String temp1       String temp2  source.getsrcPos     for int i  0 i lt length i          temp1  source.getsrcPos  1         source.setsrcPos  1, temp2         temp2  temp1         srcPos       codepre  pNow, I was thinking of implementing Insertion sort by counter the number of elements when I first throw them into the arraylist and then changing my merge method to the following.p  precodepublic static void mergeArrayListltStringgt list, int low, int high     ifhighlowdataSize1         int mid  low  high  2         mergelist, low, mid         mergelist, mid  1, high         insertionSortlist    else if low lt high          int mid  low  high  2         mergelist, low, mid         mergelist, mid  1, high         mergeSortlist, low, mid, high        codepre  pHowever, this actually makes my algorithm to take an eternity. Im guessing Im doing this wrong and the algorithm is taking n2 to run since the data is completely randomly generated and no where close to almost sorted.p  pWhat am I doing wrong Any suggestions My guess is since its in place mergesort it wont work.p  pThanksp
Negative 81106 pI was asked to build iOS 6 application in Xcode 4.5.1 for real iOS device. My customer gave me  .developerprofile file and password. But when I drag and drop that file to Xcode and tried to enter password  it said that password wrong. So I went to OrginiserProvisioning Profiles click to refresh, entered my customers id and password and Xcode downloaded provisioning profiles. But status was marked as Valid signing identity not found and trying to ProductArchive I had a code signing error. But  the expiration date of provisioning profiles given to me is 2013 When I went to Apples site provisioning profiles using my customers account I saw that developer and distribution certificates are active. I even downloaded them. In keychain utility I can see those certificates but without private keys. So, the question is what Im doing wrong  How can I build my app with my customers developer profile, how can I obtain valid signing identity. And please dont sent me to apple site I WAS there. I want to know clear advices and detailed instructions how to fix this, please.p

Thats because Im only trying to just test this .ajax function out and later Ill add a form and invoke that call from some event.

I just wonder if its how Im forming my .ajax call in terms of the callback and maybe related to, my controller method is not fully correct  Im returning json from my action but its ok to have how I have it I assume.  I dont know, unless I can try something different in my action method thats returning the json.  I dont know if my .ajax call needs to specify the return type expected in the callback now that I just thought about it as I am typing this but Ill check that also.p  pfor example when I setup the .ajax call like this see below, Im getting a response back so I think that tells me IIS is able to send a response after it hit my route and controller ok.  So Im thinking its my action method thats not returning a correct json object, not really sure but at this point, if the route debugger from Phil Haack shows its definitely hitting my routes, then it cant be that...the ajax call IS hitting my route.  p  precode   .ajax         url OurAppSearchMember26049,         type GET,         dataType json,         success function response                       alertwe got a mother fing response             grid  new Slick.GridmemberSearchResultsGrid, response.data, columns, options         ,         error function e  alertresponse error        codepre  pso I get the alert for the error case above, its hitting this.  I dont know if I will always get a response...probably I assume IIS would respond in a failed request AND successful route request...p  pI tried to attach to the worker process and then refresh the page after setting a debug point on the first line of that action method thats returning json in my controller but that line is never hit.  I dont know why.

So, in C code, the variables might be defined asp  precodeint microchipIDNumber char dogname[500] codepre  pThe C variables need to be updated by assignments in Lua and its value needs to be retrieved by Lua when it is on the right of the equal sign.  I have tried the index and newindex metamethod concept but everything I try seems to break down when I have 2 dots in the Lua path to the variable.  I know I am probably making it more complicated with the 2 dots, but it makes the organization much easier to read in the Lua code.  I also need to get an event for the assignment because I need to spin up some hardware when the microchipIDNumber value changes.  I assume I can do this through the newindex while I am setting the value.p  pAny ideas on how you would code the metatables and methods to accomplish the nesting  Could it be because my previous function declarations are confusing Luap

Negative 81106 pUsing the combination of tools in the title, when I check out a branch, SourceTreeGIT willp  pA Definitely NOT delete folders from the previously checkedout branch, so if I have BRANCHALPHA with FOLDER1 and FOLDER2 and then I check out BRANCHBETA which has FOLDER2 and FOLDER3 only and no FOLDER1, the resulting structure in FINDER will show that FOLDER1 is still there.

Its really a problem with GIT.p  pThe only solution is to delete all the folders and all the metadata and then check out the branch.

Negative 81106 pFollowing a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14658230my previous questiona, let me be more precise and less obfuscative about what exactly I want. I wrote a chemical package, where I made a decision that the names of all the chemicals and reactions will be capitalized, such as ATP, Adenosine, DeoxyCytidine etc. That allowed me to write egp  precodeATP  ChemicalSpecies.new initialconcentration 225.0      in micromolars GDP  ChemicalSpecies.new initialconcentration 75.0       in micromolars codepre  pNow if ATP is used to phosphorylate GDP, using enzyme NDPK with catalytic constantp  precodeNDPKconstant  0.6 codepre  p, this I want to be written asp  precodeChemicalReaction.new name ATPGDPphosphateexchange,                      rate lambda  ATP  GDP  NDPKconstant  codepre  pI could just writep  precodeChemicalReaction.new name ATPGDPphosphateexchange,                      reactants [ ATP, GDP ],                      rate lambda  reactant1, reactant2 reactant1  reactant2  NDPKconstant  codepre  pBut it seems too wet to me. See how codereactant1code, codereactant2code repeqt twice, while codeATPcode, codeGDPcode being in mind. The easy solution would bep  precodeChemicalReaction.new name ATPGDPphosphateexchange,                      rate lambda  ATP  GDP  NDPKconstant  codepre  pAnd codeinstanceevalcode the ratefinding block in the context that defines codeATPcode and codeGDPcode as concentrations of codeATPcode, codeGDPcode. This is very very close, but not emexactlyem the thing I want, and that pisses the heaven out of me. I could even use codeRubyVMcode to find, which chemicals are used inside the block, consider eg.p  precoderequire ap  awesomeprint, like prettyprint but fancier, install if you dont have ap RubyVMInstructionSequence.disassemble lambda  ATP  GDP  NDPKconstant  .split n  gt [ 0]  disasm ltRubyVMInstructionSequenceblock in irbbindingirbgt,     [ 1]  catch table,     [ 2]  catch type redo   st 0000 ed 0027 sp 0000 cont 0000,     [ 3]  catch type next   st 0000 ed 0027 sp 0000 cont 0027,     [ 4] ,     [ 5] 0000 trace            1                                                 22,     [ 6] 0002 putself          ,     [ 7] 0003 send             ATP, 0, nil, 24, ltic0gt,     [ 8] 0009 putself          ,     [ 9] 0010 send             GDP, 0, nil, 24, ltic1gt,     [10] 0016 optmult         ltic5gt,     [11] 0018 getinlinecache   25, ltic3gt,     [12] 0021 getconstant      NDPKconstant,     [13] 0023 setinlinecache   ltic3gt,     [14] 0025 optmult         ltic6gt,     [15] 0027 leave codepre  pBy parsing this, one learns what names are inside codeATPcode and codeGDPcode. But like I said, out of stubbornness, I find codeATPcode, codeGDPcode ugly. I want to say just codeATPcode, codeGDPcode, or perhaps code[ATP]code, code[GDP]code, because chemists use brackets for concentrations. I know that this is what Yusuke Endoh calls constrained coding. My question is, can either of these two desirable syntaxes be beaten For example, having a closure codelambda  ATP  GDP  NDPKconstant code, disassembling it givesp  precodeap RubyVMInstructionSequence.disassemble lambda  ATP  GDP  NDPKconstant  .split n  gt [ 0]  disasm ltRubyVMInstructionSequenceblock in irbbindingirbgt,     [ 1]  catch table,     [ 2]  catch type redo   st 0000 ed 0027 sp 0000 cont 0000,     [ 3]  catch type next   st 0000 ed 0027 sp 0000 cont 0027,     [ 4] ,     [ 5] 0000 trace            1                                                 23,     [ 6] 0002 getinlinecache   9, ltic0gt,     [ 7] 0005 getconstant      ATP,     [ 8] 0007 setinlinecache   ltic0gt,     [ 9] 0009 getinlinecache   16, ltic1gt,     [10] 0012 getconstant      GDP,     [11] 0014 setinlinecache   ltic1gt,     [12] 0016 optmult         ltic5gt,     [13] 0018 getinlinecache   25, ltic3gt,     [14] 0021 getconstant      NDPKconstant,     [15] 0023 setinlinecache   ltic3gt,     [16] 0025 optmult         ltic6gt,     [17] 0027 leave  codepre  pOne sees that codegetconstantcode appeared at lines 7, 10 for codeATPcode, codeGDPcode. Outside the block, codeATPcode and codeGDPcode constants contain codeChemicalSpeciescode instances, but inside the block, I want them to refer to ATP and GDP emconcentrationsem. I didnt find any way to evaluate the block in an evironment where the constants themselves have different meanings that is, unless I want to temporarily rewrite the constants at runtime using dirty tricks, which is what I dont want. What I crave for is to be able to replace this RubyVM code codegetconstant ATPcode instruction by eg. codesend  ATP, 0, nil, 24, ltic0gtcode, and then eg. codeinstanceevalcode this closure in an evironment where codeATPcode means codeATP.concentrationcode... I know Im asking difficult questions, sorry again...p  pAs for the second option code[ATP]code, code[GDP]code, that one would require activating some sort of new array creation hook inside the block only, so that if there is just one element, that is a codeChemicalSpeciescode, its concentration would be returned instead of an array object. I think this is equally difficult, if not impossible task.p

Negative 81106 pWe have built a WCF service, set up as a SOAP service.  It reads data from a database, assembles a response and returns it to the client.  Because it queries all data it needs from the database, assembles the entire response in memory and returns it to the client, there can be a substantial memory requirement if the amount of data is large.p  pBasically, the client is requesting a particular record from the database, which contains a blob, which we dont have control over its size.  We expect the size of the data could range from 10k to 3mb or so.   Are there techniques we could employ were we could stream the data out of the database and to the WCF response so we dont have to load the full 3mb in memory all at oncep  pstrongEditstrongbr Originally, I thought this might be a duplicate of  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1935040howtohandlelargefileuploadsviawcfHow to handle large file uploads via WCFa, but that solution requires using Stream as the parameter in the OperationContract.

Negative 81106 pI noticed that the simulator in VS2012 is apparently opening a new Windows session with the same account, which causes many issuesp  ul liI cant use the Modern UI version of IE, because IE is not my default browser. But if I set it as the default browser in the simulator, it also becomes the default browser in my host session, which I dont wantli lifor apps that are scheduled to start when the session starts, a new instance is started in the simulator. For instance ul liDropbox it could probably cause serious issues if both instances try to synchronize the same physical folderli liSpark it detects that someone else connected with the same account from another computer, so Im disconnected in the host sessionli liLogitech Setpoint it captures the mouse wheel in the simulator, which means I cant use the wheel any more in the host session I have to kill Setpoint in the simulator to fix itli ulli ul  pIt seems to me that the best way to fix this problem would be to have the simulator open a session with a different user account, so that it doesnt interfere with my current session. But I couldnt find any option to control the behavior of the simulator... Is it possible at allp

Negative 81106 pI wrote a method in Groovy using the range operator in order to execute the same code multiple timesp  precode   Prints the code files code copyCount times using    code printService.   ltpgt   Exceptions may be thrown.   param printService Print service   param files List of code File objects   param copyCount Number of copies to print   private static void printJob         PrintService printService,          ListltFilegt files,          int copyCount        No multiple copy support for PS files, must do it manually     for  i in 1..copyCount            Print files       codepre  pThis method did not pass unit testing as it badly fails when codecopyCountcode is 0.p  pI searched a hrefhttpgroovy.codehaus.orgCollectionsCollectionsCollectionsRanges relnofollowthe documentationa and it seems that Groovy implements ranges like a list of sequential values. As I understand, a range does not represent a representation of an interval of integers since it also has the notion of order embedded.p  pIn Groovy codea..bcode is not the set of integers x such that codea lt x lt bcode.p  pIn Groovy codea..bcode is the representation of the enumeration codeu [0,ba] gt [a..b]code defined as codeu0  acode, for all codeicode in code[1,ba]code, codeui  ui1  sgnbacodep  pNow I can fix my codep  precode    if copyCount gt 0 for  i in 1..copyCount            Print files      codepre  pAlso in Groovy codea..ltbcode is the representation of the enumeration codeu [0,ba1] gt [a..b1]code defined as codeu0  acode, for all codeicode in code[1,ba1]code, codeui  ui1  sgnbacodep  pI noticed that the code below is also working for codecopyCountcode positive or zerop  precode    for  i in 0..ltcopyCount            Print files      codepre  pStill, if I can choose a solution where damages are minimized in case of inconsistency say codecopyCountcode is 200, I may get 200prints...p  precode    0.stepcopyCount, 1           Print files      codepre  pAt least with this solution Iget a codeGroovyRuntimeException Infinite loopcode in case of a negative codecopyCountcode.

I also found it safer in case of inconsistency. Still, it is not so groovy.p  precode    for  i  1  i lt copyCount  i            Print files      codepre  pWhy does the range operator in Groovy is so complicated As I see it, the fact that the step is magically determined and that we cant force it like in Ruby is a big flaw in this implementation. Am I the only one who was ever troubled by this two prints instead of none, it would have been a bad bug   Did I miss something Is there any practical case where it is required for a range to revert order when the higher bound gets lower than the lower bound Am I being too pickyp

Negative 81106 pI would like to use MongoDBs ObjectIDs to identify resources in RESTful calls. However, Im having trouble figuring out how to properly structure PUT calls.p  pAs I understand it, a proper PUT call path should include the ID of the resource to modify. If the resource with that ID exists, it is modified if it does not exist, it is created. The latter case is the one I have trouble with the client making the PUT request does not know the ID that MongoDB will generate, and therefore it cannot use the ID as part of the request.p  pI imagine this is a fairly common scenario when using autogenerated keys as resource IDs, yet I havent been able to find an explanation on how to deal with it correctly. I can ditch the idea of using ObjectIDs and use some other value in the document, but that doesnt work well for some kinds of collections. How do others do itp

Negative 81106 pWindowsCp  pLooking for some recommendations on how to reset the security attributes on a file after its been moved to a new folder.p  pOur standard way of creating files and download from the server is to create the file in a temporary folder, then as the file streams down, the file is appended.  Once the download is completed, we move the file to its final destination.p  pMoveFile will transfer the security on the file when the file is moved.  In certain configuration this causes a problem  where the security defaults of final folder dont match the original folder.   We cannot mess with folder security....p  pSo, ultimately, I would like to perform an operation on the file after I move it.  My current thinking is that I should fetch the security attributes of the folder it goes into, and then apply to the file after the move is completed.p

The ESB might enrich, route, etc.li liFinally, some other process consumes RabbitMQ and instructs the DMS what to create new policy folder, update policy metadata, etc.li ol  pThe triple queuing, MSSQL, Oracle and RabbitMQ, seems like overkill but on the other hand they all perform different things.p  h2Existing setuph2  pI have a greenfield messagingESBmiddlewareSOA environment and would like to set it up properly to handle, at first, the problem below.  p  ul liLOBA insurance application written in JAVA on a MS SQL 2008 databaseli liLOBB insurance application written in Visual Basic 6 on an Oracle 10.2 databaseli liDMS Microsoft SharePoint 2010li liBoth LOB apps are likley to be replaced in the next 18 monthsli liMore insurance apps may come into the fold in future, as well as a CRMli ul  h2Problemh2  pBoth LOB apps need to interact with the document management system by signalling when new policies, customers, etc. are created as well as when they are modified.

Negative 81106 pSince Javascript performance can possibly get intensive on large input forms, what is the cleanest and fastest way to track and mark changes to the input fields p  pemThe project is using .NET MVC and the inputs are bound to ViewModels but that is likely at least semi irrelevant.em My main concern is to avoid performance issues if there are possibly a few thousand fields and a number of hidden input fields generally there is a lesser amount, however there are cases where there can potentially be a couple thousand. There are dropdowns, textfields, checkboxes, etc.p  pA long form with various input types.p  precodeltinput type... textboxselect... classtrackMe ... gt ltinput typehidden classhiddenInputIsDirty ... gt codepre  pThe options that come to mind.p  pUnobtrusivelyp  precode .trackMe .on change, function      this.siblinghiddenInputIsDirty.valtrue  codepre  pOr p  pAlternatively using codeonClickObserve.MarkChangedcode on the input.p  precodefunction Observe, , undefined               Public Method     Observe.MarkChanged  function          this.siblinghiddenInputIsDirty.valtrue               window.Observe window.Observe , jQuery  codepre  pTo clarify Each visible input field will have a hidden input field to mark.

Negative 81106 pI have a strange problem that Im trying to sort out.  I have a website with a bunch of linkwrapped images which are only displaying on certain machines if we switch to compatibility mode.  Normally, I would think this is a problem with my website, but it only happens on certain machines.  Im on IE 10 and its fine, one machine with IE 9 on it doesnt work, but another one, also with IE 9 with an identical version number, works fine.  Ive also seen this happen on our VM desktop on some images, but not others, so there seems to be little rhyme nor reason behind when it happens. The HTML code for this is very basicp  precodeltdiv idMenuListgt lta hrefOrderSummary idMenuLinkSummary targetselfgtltimg altOrder Summary idMenuImageSummary srcContentimagesordersummary.jpg gtltagt lta hrefOrderSearch idMenuLinkSearch targetselfgtltimg altOrder Search idMenuImageSearch srcContentimagesordersearch.jpg gtltagt codepre  pThe images are jpegs  these were produced by our design company so I dont know if there are any formatting specifics with them that might cause this.p  pI validated my page and it validates OK apart from some objections with HTML tags being inserted by JavaScript the validator thinks that Im putting tags into my head area, so this is understandable plus one odd objection in another area to the target attribute in p  precodeltli classSideBargtlta hrefHelpGoHomeIndex targetblankgtHelpltagtltligt codepre  pbut this is on a menu bar and is nothing to do with the images.p  pThe other thing that could be causing it is our web filter maybe interfering with something  Ive only had reports of it from within our network, but that doesnt mean its not happening outside, so this is another, unfortunately unknown, variable.p  pAnother possible cause Im contemplating is if its a caching issue.  The trouble with that is I dont want to forcibly expire our content as some of our users are out in the middle of nowhere and only have dialup access, so efficient caching is important.p  pHas anyone seen this before  If so, is it an IE problem, or something caused by my website  If its the former, is there anything I can do, from the server side  I know I can force compatibility mode for the document in IE, but Id rather not do this, unless I can avoid it, as Id rather sort out the underlying problem.p  pSorry, I cant post the website as its our customer portal and so requires a login, but its running on IIS note sure about the version, but I can find out, if it might make a difference.p

I am now attempting to process this data into an already existing Mail Merge Word Document. Anyone have experience with this sort of thing that could help me out This is my first time with Mail Merge.p  pSome similar applications Ive looked over use the Word Document by writing first the Headers and then the query result records to a .txt file, which is then used as the source for the Mail Merge Word Document. Like I said, Ive never messed with Mail Merge before, but, wouldnt it be possible to process the records in my ListView directly into the Mail Merge operationp

Negative 81106 pI recently added the crossorigin attribute to certain script tags to enable my scripts to gather error information from scripts from a different subdomain. I added the header in nginx to allow the crossorigin request.p  pSince then, I occasionally have a page load without the browser requesting certain javascript files from the server. Reloading the page resolves the issue, but this has happened several times now.p  pI think this is related to CORS, but since it works most of the time, I have no idea how to reproduce it.p  pHere are some excerpts from my codep  pNginx configuration contains this rule for javascript files in a certain locationp  precodeaddheader AccessControlAllowOrigin httporigin codepre  pMy script tag in the php pagep  precodeltscript typetextjavascript srcltphp print hostjsfilenamevversiongt crossorigingtltscriptgt codepre  pWhen my page loads, I can see in Firebug that the script tag is correct, but in the Firebug Net tab there isnt even a request shown. Normally there is a request shown, even if it uses a cached version of the file.p  pI found one question here which I thought might be related a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14228839allofmybrowsersarenotsendingtheoriginheader1423835114238351all of my browsers are not sending the origin headera But thinking about it further, I think there should be an initial request which would fail and which would show in Firebug.p  pDoes anyone have any theories on why this might be happeningp  pEdit I added a separate access log for my CORS requests. Any file in the location which gets Nginx adding the CORS header also gets logged in a new access log.p  pWhen the page fails to load a javascript file, Nginx is logging a request with a 304 status not modified. That means that Nginx got a conditional request for the resource only if modified, and Nginx sent back the 304 and nothing else. If the cached version was not loaded with the CORS header, then maybe the javascript can not be executed.p  pI have a version number which I append to the src of the script tag as shown above. This version number has changed. So shouldnt that cause the browser to rerequest all these resources as if they had a different file name I think the browser should have been treating these as uncached resources. There should not have been any requests that could result in a 304. What could be causing thisp

Negative 81106 pIm working on an Android background subtraction project, with a moving camera. Im trying to use feature matching, findHomography and warpPerspective to find overlapping pixels between two frames. However, the output I get is slightly incorrect. Im quite new to image processing, so Im not familiar with all the terminology. I have 2 main issuesp  p1 The result of warpPerspective is overly distorted  e.g. the image is skewed, objects in the image are flipped, squished, etc. How do I solve this p  p2 I sometimes get an OpenCV Error Assertation failed error, which crashes my app. This error maps to warpPerspective. Notes the dimensions in image1 previous frame and image2 current frame are the same. I convert the images to gray before detecting features currently from RGB. I was sometimes getting a similar OpenCV assertion failed error with findHomography, but I learned it needs at least 4 points  so adding an if statement solved it, but not sure how to solve the error with warpPerspective.    p  pThe error I getp  precode0224 153049.554 Ecverror4589 OpenCV Error Assertion failed type  src2.type ampamp src1.cols  src2.cols ampamp type  CV32F  type  CV8U      in void cvbatchDistancecvInputArray, cvInputArray, cvOutputArray, int, cvOutputArray, int, int, cvInputArray, int, bool,      file homereportscislavedesktop50SDKopencvmodulescoresrcstat.cpp, line 2473 codepre  pMy codep  precodevoid stitchFrames      convert frames to grayscale     image1  prevFrame.clone     image2  currFrame.clone      ifcolourSpace1 convert from RGB to gray         cvcvtColorimage1, image1Gray,CVRGB2GRAY         cvcvtColorimage2, image2Gray,CVRGB2GRAY          else ifcolourSpace2 convert from HSV to gray         cvcvtColorimage1, image1Gray,CVHSV2RGB         cvcvtColorimage1Gray,image1Gray,CVRGB2GRAY         cvcvtColorimage2, image1Gray,CVHSV2RGB         cvcvtColorimage2Gray,image1Gray,CVRGB2GRAY           else ifcolourSpace3 no need for conversion         image1Gray  image1         image2Gray  image2           FEATURE DETECTION      key points     stdvectorltKeyPointgt keypoints1, keypoints2      int minHessian      cvFastFeatureDetector detector      detector.detectimage1Gray,keypoints1 prevFrame     detector.detectimage2Gray,keypoints2 currFrame      KeyPoint kp  keypoints2[4]     Point2f p  kp.pt     float i  p.y      FEATURE EXTRACTION      extracted descriptors     cvMat descriptors1,descriptors2      OrbDescriptorExtractor extractor     extractor.computeimage1,keypoints1,descriptors1 prevFrame     extractor.computeimage2,keypoints2,descriptors2 currFrame      FEATURE MATCHING      BruteForceMacher      BFMatcher matcher      stdvectorlt cvDMatch gt matches result of matching descriptors     stdvectorlt cvDMatch gt goodMatches result of sifting matches to get only good matches      matcher.matchdescriptors1,descriptors2,matches      HOMOGRAPY  WARPPERSPECTIVE  PERSPECTIVETRANSFORM      double maxDist  0.0 keep track of max distance from the matches     double minDist  80.0 keep track of min distance from the matches      calculate max amp min distances between keypoints     forint i0 iltdescriptors1.rowsi         DMatch match  matches[i]          float dist  match.distance         if distltminDist minDist  dist         ifdistgtmaxDist maxDistdist           get only the good matches     for int i  0 i lt descriptors1.rows i          DMatch match  matches[i]         ifmatch.distancelt 500             goodMatches.pushbackmatch                    stdvectorlt Point2f gt obj     stdvectorlt Point2f gt scene      get the keypoints from the good matches     for int i  0 i lt goodMatches.size i           keypoints from image1         DMatch match1  goodMatches[i]         int qI1  match1.trainIdx         KeyPoint kp1  keypoints2[qI1]         Point2f point1  kp1.pt         obj.pushbackpoint1          keypoints from image2         DMatch match2  goodMatches[i]         int qI2  match2.queryIdx         KeyPoint kp2  keypoints1[qI2]         Point2f point2  kp2.pt         scene.pushbackpoint2            calculate the homography matrix     ifgoodMatches.size gt4         Mat H  findHomographyobj,scene, CVRANSAC          warpPerspectiveimage2,warpResult,H,Sizeimage1.cols,image1.rows       codepre
Negative 81106 pIm implementing an codeNSPopovercode and having it appear in the status bar by setting it as a custom view. Ive set its behavior to Transient, and also added a global event monitor so that when any other application gets focus, the codeNSPopovercode goes away.p  pThis is working fairly well but the only problem Im running into is that click on the popover brings to focus the main window of the application.

Is there a way to prevent this Perhaps allow interaction with the popover without activating the applicationp

Negative 81106 pI have a Windows Phone 7 app which relies on ANID to store user data on remote server. Now Im preparing Windows Phone 8 version of it.

I know how to translate ANID to ANID2 a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17987520Windows Phone ANID to ANID2 conversion on Ca. But I need the whole ANID for this.  In WP7 ANID looks like A2E23ACF364795673CD7EBB58FFFFFFFFampEf48ampW3. I extract 32character value 2E23ACF364795673CD7EBB58FFFFFFFF and use it as UID I heard that remaining portion may be changed, but 32 id will always be the same.p  pSo I might convert ANID from WP7 version to ANID2 onthefly on remote server, but I dont have all 44 letters  only 32 of them. p  pI might update WP7 version with another WP7 version which sends the whole ANID to server, but I cant rely on the fact that all people will update their apps, save their data to server and then again update their apps when wp8 version will be available.p  pSo my questions are p  ul lipis there any way to get WP7style ANID value in WP8 app maybe via reflection or c pli lipit is possible convert ANID to ANID2 having only its 32character uid portionpli lipis there any way to find out whether particular ANID2 corresponds to existing 32character ANID portionpli liphow can I reverse convert ANID2 to ANID if we know developer GUIDpli lipcan user select the version to install if WP7 and WP8 versions availablepli ul  hr  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pSo far my workaround is to give users of wp8 version wp7 utility tool which generates ANID2 from ANID and stores this pair to remote database.

It seems, and I am not sure how since they are in different app pools, i can see the cookie until the .net app does a postback then i loose it.  It seems to have deleted as the classic app looses the cookie as well.  when that happens the checks that are in place route the user back to the login page to reauthenticate.  p  pOptions i can think ofp  ol liIdeal fix would be to be allow me to readcheck the cookie and leave it as is for now.li liIf the above doesnt work can I use recreate the cookie do you think each time  li liI dont know why postbacks are causing the cookie to get deleted but could i skip the check server side and locate the cookie via javascript or jquery perhaps  If so howli ol  pI would like to avoid having to write back to the database saying i authenticated unless that is all it comes down to.  Also, as i mentioned I want to try and avoid having to do much at all on the classic asp side as it will result in me hitting every single page.p  phow do i fix this cookie issuep  pThanks.p  pEDIT  one other thing I should note is that when i look in fiddler a tool which i not very savvy i can see the cookie on the classic side.  when I load the .net page within fiddler it shows the cookie as empty however the first load the cookie contents is found in pageload.  I dont get it  how i know this is within pageload i am looking for the cookie and filling a simple label with its contents.  Any time a postback occurs the contents is lost.p

Negative 81106 pIm currently creating a HTML5 music editing program. I started with recording audio. I figured out how to get access on microphon and so on. Code from Recorder.js helped me a lot.p  pBut instead of writing into an .wave file I want to create an temporary audiobuffer. I got the Float32Arrays from the inputtbuffer in onaudioprocess event and saved them all together in one Float32Array.  Now I have an Array with values, lets say from 3 Seconds of recording. Now I want to create an Audiobuffer to play the sound I recorded saved in that array.p  pIn read the [Webaudio API Specification]a hrefhttpsdvcs.w3.orghgaudiorawfiletipwebaudiospecification.html relnofollow1a but didnt found any possibility to create an new audiobuffer with an exisiting Float32Array. p  pMaybe Im doing the recording wrong or Im simply blind in reading. Every other Questions I read were linking on Recorder.js, but I dont want to save a file first and then load it again.p  pAnyone knowing Would be awesome.p  pThanks everyonep

Negative 81106 pOkay, this post is a bit wordy before I got to the actual question, so the abridged version basically pertains to cache warming using RABL templates. When calling Rabl.render vs API calls, the caches generated do not have the same cachekeys. When using Rabl.render directly should I expect cachekeys to match, when the same template is called via an APIp  pK, now the windup..p  pI have a Rails API server on Heroku. Ive done a lot of optimization with RABL using russian doll caching to improve the reuse of the underlying objects in collections.  Though, I am still left with collection caches, that when generated by the user on first request, is a burden on the experience  e.g. 1 second api calls. p  pWhen debugging a sample API call, I get the following cache actions on a given object.p  pstrong...apiv1activities26600 strongp  precodeCache read rablactivities2660020140423170223588554000hashd30440d18014c72014a05319af0626f7  Cache generate rablactivities2660020140423170223588554000hashd30440d18014c72014a05319af0626f7  Cache write rablactivities2660020140423170223588554000hashd30440d18014c72014a05319af0626f7 codepre  pstrongso for the same object when calling ...apiv1activities  after above call  I get the desired cache hitstrong p  precodeCache read rablactivities2660020140423170223588554000hashd30440d18014c72014a05319af0626f7  Cache fetchhit rablactivities2660020140423170223588554000hashd30440d18014c72014a05319af0626f7 codepre  pThis works great. The next step is to avoid having the firstany API call spend time generating the cache.br So I have been pursuing cache warming techniques to generate these collections prior to the user accessing them.  One suggestion is using codewgetcode as a way to hit the API directly  see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma543988451488httpstackoverflow.coma543988451488a .  But this adds a load on the Heroku web dynos, so I want to background cache warming via sidekiq workers.p  pRABL provides a way to render a template from code directly  a hrefhttpsgithub.comnesquenarablrenderingtemplatesdirectly relnofollowhttpsgithub.comnesquenarablrenderingtemplatesdirectlya  which definitely seems like the right approach for this use case. Therefore my intent is to call the RABL engine through some event prior to an API call for example   a User login event. p  pSo for the above API example, Id call the following in rails console and expect a cache hit. p  precodeirbmain0020gt activity  Activity.find26600 irbmain0030gt Rabl.renderactivity, apiv2activitiesshownoroot, viewpath gt appviews, format gt json  Cache read rablactivities2660020140423170223588554000hash  Cache generate rablactivities2660020140423170223588554000hash  Cache write rablactivities2660020140423170223588554000hash codepre  pUnexpectedly, I did not get a cache hit, but it is obvious that the cachekeys are not the same since the trailing hash signature is missing. Im not sure why the cachekeys would be different in this case. I am left with no way to warm caches for RABL templates. p  pUPDATEp  pTurns out the hash in the trailing cache key is the template hash.p  precode Cache digest for apiv1activitiesshow.rabl d30440d18014c72014a05319af0626f7 codepre  pThough this tells me the source of that hash, its still not clear why calling codeRablRenderercode directly would not use this as well.p
Negative 81106 pIm having a bit of an issue with a c property throwing an exception when checking for null. I dont have access to the class that contains the property causing this issue, otherwise it would be an easy fix.p  pBasically, I have a view model that contains ImportedClass. The ImportedClass is populated with a method in a shared library. I ran into an issue when a property from ImportedClass throws an exception instead of returning null or a value.p  pIt doesnt crash the app, I just cant check for null to prevent any possible errors.p  pI could assign that property to a local variable, wrapped in a trycatch to catch the error, but I find that too clunky just for one property.p  pAn example of my issuep  precodepublic string getPropertyA    get  return ImportedClass.PropertyA  throws exception    codepre
Negative 81106 pI am trying to sort an array in Javascript but something goes wrong and I cant figure out why.

Negative 81106 pWe are actually creating a website with some comunity elements. We choose django as programming language. Wed like to keep the website multilingual.  We already created some apps and website, but kept them static and singllelanguage. I read about 2 approaches to create a multilingual website. The first is to keep the translations in a database. This should be the easiest way, but way to unefficient and with an ordinary performance. I also read about setting up a xml translation file, where you can store every single translation.p  pId like to know the differences in performance and the advantage or disadvantages of these approaches. Is there any efficient way in django to keep my website multilanguagep
Negative 81106 pIm looking for a technique or algorithm that can help with a design idea.  Keep in mind that my proposed solution is open for modification, as well.br I have a series of blocks square and rectangular that fit into a grid.  The grid and the pieces are unique in that some blocks can fit into multiple locations and others can fit only into a limited number of locations.  If it helps, think of something like Battleship where the pieces have unique connectors which limits their placement.br I imagine this as a multidimensional array.  Using a sort of collision or storage contention technique I would like to devise the series of solutions where all pieces are able to fit.  An optimal solution would be the one which allows the most pieces to fit on the board at any one time. I have considered a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiIntervalscheduling relnofollowInterval Schedulinga, a variety of 2D collision detection algorithms, and looked into graph theory e.g. a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiFlownetwork relnofollowFlow Networka.  These all seem to be overkill for the design.br I dont have specific terminology for what I am looking for so searching for a solution is difficult.  If I have to brute force this then, OK, but I have to believe there is a more elegant solution.p

Negative 81106 pMy program starts with a loading window while it is compiling shaders, loading textures etc. I then want to be able to launch a fullscreen application and use these resources.

Both of these methods resulted in the loading screen being moved to the top left corner of the screen.

I dont get any exceptions raised, the delete seems to work. I properly finish the transaction and shut down the database. But when i rerun the code, i see the nodes and relationships are still there.

Negative 81106 pSo I am building a large menu out using a rather large JSON object. I originally tested it with about 250 nodes and the performance was fine. Since that was the scope for the project I wrote it off as completed and moved on.p  pNow the scope of the project requires there to be more than 3,000 nodes in the menu. In Chrome it takes about 34 seconds for the menu to be rendered, which is unacceptable enough. Then theres the fact that IE8 needs to be supported and takes almost a full minute to render the menu and you begin to see my problem.p  pNow normally I would build out a giant DOM string in JavaScript and apply it once its done and it would take lt1sec to build out the same DOM.  The problem is that all of the menu items have to be filtered based on checkboxes, which is why AngularJS was used in the first place, for realtime filtering of menu items not to mention easy rendering with recursive includes which lowered initial development time.p  pSo now I am stuck with trying to find a way to get Angular to create thousands of nodes quickly that are still databound so they can be filtered. Im already using a custom function to hideshow the nodes instead of having them be built out every time which made the menu blazing fast when addingremoving filters. Now I just need to find a way to get over this initial rendering hump.p  pHere is the markup for the menu itselfp  precodeltscript typetextngtemplate idmenuitemrenderer.htmlgt ltdiv classmenuitemgt     lta ngshowcategory.link hrefcategory.link classmenuitemtitle targetcategory.targetgt         category.title     ltagt     ltspan ngshowcategory.link classmenuitemtitlegt         category.title     ltspangt     ltspan classmenutogglebtn ngshowcategory.categories datangclasschildrenFilteredcategory.categoriesgtlti classiconplus gtltspangt     ltspan classmenuitemborder ngshowcategory.categoriesgtltspangt ltdivgt ltul classmenucategorylist listunstyledgt     ltli datangrepeatcategory in category.categories datangclassfilterResultscategory datangincludemenuitemrenderer.html classmenucategorygtltligt ltulgt codepre  pp        li   pThe JSON object is huge, but Ive set up a JSFiddle for you all so you can take a look at the render times.

Negative 81106 pI am using codeSQL Server 2008 R2code. I am having some problems finding an effective coding pattern  for codeSQLcode which supports strongcode reusabilitystrong as well as strongflexibilitystrong. By reusability, what I mean is keeping codeSQLcode queries in codeStored Procedurescode and codeUser Defined Functionscode. p  pNow, if I choose codeStored Procedurescode, I will be sacrificing its usability in a query directly. If I choose codeUser Defined Functionscode, I wont be able to use codeDMLcode statements.p  pFor example, suppose I created a codeStored Procedurescode which inserts one strongcontactstrong record. Now, if I am having a table which can act as a source of multiple strongcontactstrong records, all I am left with are either codeWHILEcode loops or codeCURSORcodes, which is clearly not a recommended option, due to its performance drawbacks. And due to the fact that DML statements are not allowed in codeUser Defined Functionscode, I simply cannot use them for this purpose.p  pAlthough, If I am not concerned with strongcode reusabilitystrong, then instead of using codeStored Procedurescode I can surely use same set of queries again and again to avoid while loops.p  pWhat pattern should I followp  pHere is a similar

Negative 81106 pIm trying to replicate a game called haxball, which is a really simple and basic 2d football game. However I am having trouble on the collision detection and I didnt want to use a engine like Box2d because its a bit of overkill for what I want and Im making the game just to practice, since Im a beginner.p  pI can check if the collision happens, but I cant resolve it properly. I loop through all objects and check if they are colliding with the ball and then, if they are, I put the ball at the border of the object so that it stops being inside the other. The problem comes here, because if the ball collides with a circle and a edge at the same time it will stay inside the edge or inside the circle.p  pThis is the code of collision resolving for the circle and detection and resolving of the edgep  precodethis.resolveCollisionCircle  functioncircle      var nv  circle.pos.subthis.pos     nv  nv.setMagcircle.radius  this.radius.addcircle.pos     this.pos  nv       Ill try to add later the bounce effect  this.edgeCollision  function      ifthis.pos.xthis.radius lt 0          this.pos.x  this.radius         this.velocity  this.velocity.multnew Vector1, 1          else ifthis.pos.xthis.radius gt Width          this.velocity  this.velocity.multnew Vector1, 1           ifthis.pos.ythis.radius lt 0          this.pos.y  this.radius         this.velocity  this.velocity.multnew Vector1, 1          else ifthis.pos.ythis.radius gt Height          console.logbaixo         this.velocity  this.velocity.multnew Vector1, 1       codepre  pThe ball moves accordingly to a velocity vector, in this case it starts as 4,0p  pDemo of the bug a hrefhttpantoniomc.0fees.us relnofollowhttpantoniomc.0fees.usap  pAlso If you could point me to a good canvas tutorial that could teach me this things, I would appreciate it I only seem to find for another languages, which helped me anyway, but it would be nice to see a canvas collision detection and resolution tutorial once in a while...p

Negative 81106 pI designed a table where you can add dynamic rows, the user can select a quantity and a price for each of them. I have a series of very simple functions that allow me to delete, empty the entire table or calculate the total of all products plugged.  So far everything works fine, the problem occurs when I create 3 rows, I add it to each of their values, then I decided to delete the second row and calculate the total. As you can see, the calculation is flawed, in fact I only returns the total of the first product added to the table. I can not understand why the script does not work properly.

Negative 81106 pI followed a tutorial on angularJS with subviews using ngviewsp  pIm using html5Mode in my locationProvider and a nodejs backendp  pIf I wanted to link to or hit refresh while on a specific ngview, I could use a hashtag.

Thats what I wanted. Of course, theres more than one way to skin a cat I guess, but it was working.p  pNow, Im trying to do that again. But this time its not working.p  pIf I try to go to localhost3000appsubview via a link or refresh, instead of going to the ngview that lives at appsubview like it did before, its going to app2Fsubview instead. And Im ..heh .. heh.. not sure whats different. I thought I was doing everything exactly the same.p  pHas anyone had this problem Does anyone know what is happeningp  pEdit I think I kind of found a workaround. If I set base href  app in the head of the html document, and then respond to a request to appsubview with a redirect to appsubview, then I can serve up app with the correct subview only the url goes to subview.

That is multiply by strong0x55555556strong and take the most significant 32 bits. This is true for n being a 32 bit number.br As I began digging the logic behind it I realised that this can be generalized. For instance if we consider n lt 128 i.e. 7 bit wide then br strongn3  n  0x56  8strong. So whats happening here  Well, strong0x56  86  2583strong and strong258strong is the first number bigger than 256 which is divisible by 3. Now,br strong2n  258n  256nstrong br  strongn  129n  128nstrong for any nbr But if restrict n lt 128 then 129n  128n is same as quotient of 129n128.br  strongn  129n128strong n lt 128br  strongn3  43n128strong for n lt 128br  strongn3  86n256strong n lt 128br  strongn3  n  0x56  8strongbrp  pIt is amazing how this can be generalised to other divisions.

These arrays are statically allocated to reduce    complexity, but this code could be easily modified to perform dynamic    memory allocation.      When arguments are added they are placed into these arrays.  The    Vargs array contains the argument values, and the lpszArgNames array    contains the name of the arguments, or a NULL if the argument is unnamed.    Flags for the argument such as NOFREEVARIANT are kept in the wFlags array.      When Invoke is called, the names in the lpszArgNames array are converted    into the DISPIDs expected by the IDispatchInvoke function.  The    IDispatchGetIDsOfNames function is used to perform the conversion, and    the resulting IDs are placed in the DispIds array.  There is an additional    slot in the DispIds and lpszArgNames arrays to allow for the name and DISPID    of the method or property being invoked.        Because these arrays are static, it is important to call the ClearArgs    function before setting up arguments.  ClearArgs releases any memory    in use by the argument array and resets the argument counters for a fresh    Invoke.   int           miArgCount int           miNamedArgCount VARIANTARG    maVargs[MAXDISPARGS] DISPID        maDispIds[MAXDISPARGS  1]       one extra for the member name LPOLESTR  malpszArgNames[MAXDISPARGS  1]  used to hold the argnames for GetIDs WORD      mawFlags[MAXDISPARGS]   CXLAutomationCXLAutomation      mpdispExcelApp  NULL     mpdispWorkbook  NULL     mpdispWorksheet  NULL     mpdispActiveChart  NULL     InitOLE     StartExcel     SetExcelVisibleTRUE     CreateWorkSheet     CreateXYChart   CXLAutomationCXLAutomationBOOL bVisible      mpdispExcelApp  NULL     mpdispWorkbook  NULL     mpdispWorksheet  NULL     mpdispActiveChart  NULL     InitOLE     StartExcel     SetExcelVisiblebVisible     CreateWorkSheet     CreateXYChart   CXLAutomationCXLAutomation      ReleaseExcel     ReleaseDispatch     OleUninitialize   BOOL CXLAutomationInitOLE      DWORD dwOleVer      dwOleVer  CoBuildVersion       check the OLE library version     if rmm  HIWORDdwOleVer               MessageBoxNULL, TIncorrect version of OLE libraries., Failed, MBOK  MBICONSTOP         return FALSE            could also check for minor version, but this application is      not sensitive to the minor version of OLE       initialize OLE, fail application if we cant get OLE to init.     if FAILEDOleInitializeNULL               MessageBoxNULL, TCannot initialize OLE., Failed, MBOK  MBICONSTOP         return FALSE            return TRUE    BOOL CXLAutomationStartExcel      CLSID clsExcelApp       if Excel is already running, return with current instance     if mpdispExcelApp  NULL         return TRUE       Obtain the CLSID that identifies EXCEL.APPLICATION       This value is universally unique to Excel versions 5 and up, and       is used by OLE to identify which server to start.

Takes the IDispatch object on which to invoke,    and the name of the method or property as a String.  Arguments, if any,    must have been previously setup using the AddArgumentXxx functions.      Returns TRUE if the call succeeded.  Returns FALSE if an error occurred.    A messagebox will be displayed explaining the error unless the DISPNOSHOWEXCEPTIONS    flag is specified.  Errors can be a result of unrecognized method or property    names, bad argument names, invalid types, or runtimeexceptions defined    by the recipient of the Invoke.      The argument list is reset via ClearAllArgs if the DISPFREEARGS flag is    specified.  If not specified, it is up to the caller to call ClearAllArgs.      The return value is placed in pvargReturn, which is allocated by the caller.    If no return value is required, pass NULL.  It is up to the caller to free    the return value ReleaseVariant.      This function calls IDispatchGetIDsOfNames for every invoke.  This is not    very efficient if the same method or property is invoked multiple times, since    the DISPIDs for a particular method or property will remain the same during    the lifetime of an IDispatch object.  Modifications could be made to this code    to cache DISPIDs.  If the target application is always the same, a similar    modification is to statically browse and store the DISPIDs at compiletime, since    a given application will return the same DISPIDs in different sessions.    Eliminating the extra crossprocess GetIDsOfNames call can result in a    signficant time savings.

If appropriate, memory may be    allocated to represent the argument.  This memory will be    automatically freed the next time ClearAllArgs is called unless    the NOFREEVARIANT flag is specified for a particular argument.  If    NOFREEVARIANT is specified it is the responsibility of the caller    to free the memory allocated for or contained within the argument.      Arguments may be named.  The name string must be a Cstyle string    and it is owned by the caller.  If dynamically allocated, the caller    must free the name string.

Negative 81106 pthis is a component for a class assignment so I apologize if I cannot go in depth as I need to. p  pTo summarize, I need to write a python function that groups all identical files meaning files with identical content that have varying file names. The purpose of grouping them is to eventually create a dictionary of type string list where the list is the group of identical files and the key string is simply the first entry in the group when sorted in alphabetical order. We are given a directory of files. p  pSo far, I have a program that iterates through each file using glob and I am also using filecmp.cmpfile1,file2 to find identical files. What I am struggling with is the logic required to successfully compare what can be up to 1000 files. Im sure there is a more pythonic way to do this task rather than compare file1 to file2, file1 to file3, etc.p  pIn conclusion, I know how to iterate through the list of files and I know how to create a dictionary once I have my groups of identical files... Im just a bit lost on how to efficiently get the groups of files. p  pSample Implementation Have 7 files A, AA, AAA, B, BB, C, D. Files A, AA, and AAA are the same and B and BB are the same while C and D are unique. My final dictionary should be p  pA [A, AA, AAA], B [B, BB], C [C], D [D]p  pThanks in advance for your timep
Negative 81106 pIm struggling with a iosltserver php post btw Im a newbie in objective c I cannot understand in depth how ARC works, since from what I read ARC must do the dirty job for me Im talking about unused objects release.

BUT, on the memory pane tool I noticed that the amount of memory required by my app grows on every POST done, no matters if I use NSURLConnection or AFNetworking 2 or other examples I found on the internet.

Negative 81106 pAmong other things, one reason for liberal use of const that Ive seen is that, by ensuring that the value wont change, the compiler can more effectively optimize the resulting code. This seems reasonable but Ive also heard that the benefits of this are somewhat minimal.p  pIn any case, would be same be true when working with stateless classes  objects Could you reasonably expect even a minor speedup from marking stateless objects const, or are todays compilers good enough to recognize statelessness, and optimize for it regardless of whether its marked const or notp  pFeel free to answer either in terms of specific compilers, or compilers in general.p

However, I ran into a little design decision. p  pLets say I run a car rental shop, with several cars, several customers, and different customers can use different cars.

The first would be the car, the second the number of kilometers that the customer drove with that car. But that doesnt feel right. Any suggestionp

Negative 81106 pI know this is probably obvious, but Ive searched and found no solution. I want to have an anchorpane wrapped in a scrollpane. In that scrollpane. I wanted the actual view size to be 1000x1000 but the scrollable area to be 1920x1080. I want the anchorpane to be 1920x1080 the full size of the scrolled scrollpane. p  pFirst question How do I set the scrollable area size I set HMax 1920, HMin 0, HValue 0 and VMax 1080 VMin 0, VValue 0. This doesnt seem to be doing the trick, and I only set these values based off information I loosely understood found on the javafx api. p  pSecond question How do I set the anchorpane to the full scrollable size of the scrollpane I wrapped it in the scrollpaneIm doing this in scenebuilder but I am not sure it will automatically fill the entire scrollpane, including when the scroll pane is scrolled. p
Negative 81106 pI am using JBoss Cache tried versions 3.2.7 and 3.1.0 to have a replicated Map for caching data between Application Servers. In the past I did some checks if it works out and it did. My testenvironment always were 2 nodes in the same network segment. Since IT deparments sometimes have a problem with UDP, we use TCP TCPPING for discovery. Now a customer reported problems with our nodes losing their sync, not replicating data. They have 4 nodes in 2 subnets 2 and 2. They say when they onbly use 2 nodes in any subnet it works. When they start the third, the problems begin. The logfile state a lot of merge problems indicating a partitioning problem. So I did my own tests in my company. My setup is my Laptop under Windows and two virtual machines with Ubuntu. The virtual machines use bridged networking interfaces. DHCP is used and our IT department provides my 3 nodes with different subnet IPs. My Host Laptop is in a different net than the virtual machines are. TCP Communication between the nodes works. There should be no firewall involved. So much to my setup. I wrote a little Program that just initializes JBoss Cache, gets the cacheMAP and in an intervall changes values in the map, and afterwards showing the content of the whole map. Pretty simple, 2 Classes involved. My JBoss Cache setup is as followsp  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingUTF8gt ltjbosscache xmlnsxsihttpwww.w3.org2001XMLSchemainstance             xmlnsurnjbossjbosscachecoreconfig3.1gt     ltclustering modereplication clusterNamejgroups.clusternameDEFAULTgt     ltstateRetrieval timeout20000 fetchInMemoryStatetrue gt     ltsync replTimeout20000 gt     ltjgroupsConfiggt             ltTCP startportjgroups.tcpping.startport7800 loopbacktrue recvbufsize20000000                  sendbufsize640000 discardincompatiblepacketstrue                  maxbundlesize64000 maxbundletimeout30                  useincomingpackethandlertrue enablebundlingfalse                  usesendqueuesfalse sockconntimeout3000                  skipsuspectedmemberstrue useconcurrentstacktrue                   threadpool.enabledtrue threadpool.minthreads1                  threadpool.maxthreads25 threadpool.keepalivetime5000                  threadpool.queueenabledfalse threadpool.queuemaxsize100                  threadpool.rejectionpolicyrun oobthreadpool.enabledtrue                  oobthreadpool.minthreads1 oobthreadpool.maxthreads8                  oobthreadpool.keepalivetime5000                  oobthreadpool.queueenabledfalse                  oobthreadpool.queuemaxsize100                  oobthreadpool.rejectionpolicyrun gt             ltTCPPING timeout3000                      initialhostsjgroups.tcpping.initialhostslocalhost[7800],localhost[7801]                      portrange3 numinitialmembers3 gt             ltMERGE2 maxinterval100000 mininterval20000 gt             ltMERGE3 maxinterval100000 mininterval20000 gt             ltFDSOCK gt             ltFD timeout10000 maxtries5 shuntrue gt             ltVERIFYSUSPECT timeout1500 gt             ltBARRIER gt             ltpbcast.NAKACK usemcastxmitfalse gclag0                            retransmittimeout300,600,1200,2400,4800 discarddeliveredmsgstrue gt             ltUNICAST timeout300,600,1200 gt             ltpbcast.STABLE stabilitydelay1000                            desiredavggossip50000 maxbytes400000 gt             ltVIEWSYNC avgsendinterval60000 gt             ltpbcast.GMS printlocaladdrtrue jointimeout6000                         shuntrue viewbundlingtrue gt             ltFC maxcredits2000000 minthreshold0.10 gt             ltFRAG2 fragsize60000 gt             ltpbcast.STREAMINGSTATETRANSFER gt         ltjgroupsConfiggt     ltclusteringgt ltjbosscachegt codepre  pstarting my test nodes I provide them with the following System properties.p  precodeDjgroups.bindaddrNODE1  Djgroups.tcpping.initialhostsNODE1[7900],NODE2[7900],NODE3[7900] Djgroups.tcpping.startport7900 codepre  pFrom the logging messages I can see the GMS message that the NODE address is indeed as specified NODEX[7900] for all nodes.p  pNODE13 are given as IP numbers. Those IP numbers can be reached from other nodes. NODE1,2 are in the same subnet NODE3 is in a different subnetp  pI did an incredible amount of tests, changing the config, the JBossCache version, the combinations of nodes running etc. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt. One cause that seems to influence if the members find each other is the initial hosts info. Depending on the order of the hosts, if there are additional hosts to the 3 given, leaving out the own ip out of the list the setup works or not. It also depends on the order the nodes are started.p  pI am sure it has to do with the JGroups Group membership. Maybe parameters need to be added to make it more robust. I really would appreciate some hints on what to try in order to get the nodes talking to each other reliably.p  pI addition to trying to figure out the problems with JBoss CacheJGroups I did the same test using Hazelcast TCP instead. It PERFECTLY works without any problem, so the basic networking should work for the nodes. I consider to switch to Hazelcast, but this requires redeployments in several of our customers IT departments and I would want to avoid that.p

When I click on the id its a link anchor tag, it should take me to another page which has all the details about that id.p  pApproach   I thought of creating a cookie which will store the value of the id clicked, and get the cookie in tornado handler and retrieve all information about that id and send it to the next view.p  pThe code so far is  p  pHTML     p  precode                lttable classtable tablestriped idtableidgt                     lttbodygt                         lttrgt                           ltthgtConfig IDltthgt                            ltthgtNoteltthgt                         lttrgt                         lttrgt                              for d in data                                lttdgt                             lta onclick  configidCreateCookieFunction hrefSelectedConfig       name  configid id configidgt d[0] ltagtlttdgt                                 lttdgt  d[1]lttdgt                                end                              lttrgt                         lttbodygt                  lttablegt             ltdivgt codepre  pSo on clicking the link it would store the value of the id, and then the link points to a handler where I can get the cookie and retrieve more information about that id.p  pJavaScriptp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt  function configidCreateCookieFunction   var cid  document.getElementByIdconfigid.innerHTML   sessionStorage [configid]  cid    codepre  pp  pTornado code p  precodeclass SelectedConfigHandlerBaseHandler      def getself         configid None         configid  self.getcookieconfigid         print configid codepre  pBut this is not working. When I print the id its getting displayed as None.p  pSo basically I am not able to pull the value of the id which is a link, and the id is basically coming from the database Please help me out.

Negative 81106 pI have written a program in Cinder for OSX called ScreensaverCreator that generates screensavers. p  pInside the project I have a readybuilt default screensaver application bundle called DefaultScreensaver.saver that I just copy recursively, as a directory and rename. Lets say I rename it as NewScreensaver.saverp  pAfter copying, I insert overwrite textures and shaders in NewScreensaver.saverContentsResources which the code will know about. I also modify the NewScreensaver.saverContentsInfo.plist to change the bundle name to NewScreensaver and the bundle identifier to com.blahblah.NewScreensaver. The actual screensaver code doesnt change, it just knows what to do with the new resources, so the executable is left as NewScreensaver.saverContentsMacOSDefaultScreensaverp  pNow, this kinda works, and when I install the screensaver it has the right name and works in the preview and behaves as a screensaver. The problem comes when making multiple screensavers. They all have the same principle class name WindowImplCocoaScreenSaverDefaultScreensaver and so the OS thinks they are the same. p  pLooking in the LibraryScreen Savers directory, it seems that installing a new one doesnt actually copy the app bundle there. It just seems to reuse the one that is already there, despite having a different name and showing up as a separate screensaver in the screensaver setting panel.p  pI tried changing the name of the executable and in the plist, but that doesnt help. I believe the problem is that I need a unique principle class, but I cant recompile the screensaver each time.p  pSo, is there any way of solving this Perhaps a tool to change the principle class name of the compiled program I realise that what I am trying to do may be impossible for security reasons but I really need some kind of solution.p

Negative 81106 pIm using the bootstrap toggle add on in a project a hrefhttpwww.bootstraptoggle.com relnofollowhttpwww.bootstraptoggle.coma that is based on AngularJS.  The structure that uses the component is roughly as sop  precode   ltparentdirectivegt       lttr ngrepeatmyObject in dataSourcegt          ltchilddirectivegt             ltinput idmyToggleButton datatoggletoggle typecheckboxgt codepre  pIve narrowed down the problem to the requirement of the bootstrap toggle needing a jQuery selector to initialize the control when its dynamically created.  The call looks something like thisp  precode   myToggleButton.bootstrapToggle codepre  pIve tried to add this selector to the post compile event in my directive but the selector does not appear to be valid  p  precode        post function scope, element, attributes, controller, transcludeFn              myToggleButton.bootstrapToggle codepre  pIve added it to a button handler just to test which I manually clicked and magically it works.  There is clearly some point in which the compile post event is fired but jQuery is not functional and then at some point when regular user operations start where it is.p  pUnfortunately, the control seems to require this selector to initialize and the rows of data that hold this switch are built on the fly and not immediately when the page loads.  p  pMy question is at what point can a jQuery selector work after a compile function is completed for a directive  Im also not supply a link function with Im guessing Im going to need as well since this function does change the DOM when its called.p  pThanks in advancep
Negative 81106 pI am designing a voting application and designed a database with 2 tables  State and District.

A strongState HASA list of Districtsstrong. This is not in accord with the above database design.p  pCan someone please help me in designing JPA Entities for this. Please suggest if the database design needs modification too. Thanks.p

Negative 81106 pI have 3 programs written in Python, which need to be connected. 2 programs X and Y gather some information, which are sent by them to program Z. Program Z analyzes the data and send to program X and Y some decisions. Number of programs similar to X and Y will be expanded in the future. Initially I used named pipe to allow communication from X, Y to Z. But as you can see, I need bidirectional relation. My boss told me to use ZeroMQ.

Im out of ideas now, Ive followed the msdn page for EWS Managed Api and cant quite figure out why its now no longer picking out the emails. p  pAnother important point is Im doing a filter search which worked in the domain exchange.

There is only mention that you need to have https enabled for accessing exchange servers.p

Negative 81106 pIm trying to create a message system with JavaScript and PHP  MySQL. I have a form with two input elements recipient id, message content. Im using MVC Zend Framework 1. The form post data is send to my controller and stored in the database.p  pNow I want to encrypt the message before it is sent. I want to keep it userfriendly, so my idea was to use RSA private  public key. The idea was that a private key was generated on user log in and stored in the cookies, to make sure that the private key is only on the users machine. The public key could be stored in the users table, so that any user, who want to send a message to him, can encrypt the data.p  pIt is important that the keypair is generated by the users password. If its random generated, it would not be possible to use multiple systems to log in, because the private key would change everytime. So that would be the mechanism to make sure, that he will always have the same private key, until he is changing his password.p  pI tried a few JavaScript libraries. a hrefhttpsgithub.comwwwtyrocryptico relnofollowcrypticoa seemed to be the right choice, because it generates private  public key by password. The problem here is, that I can not store the private key and not even look into the value. p  pThey have an example on the websitep  precode The passphrase used to repeatably generate this RSA key. var PassPhrase  The Moon is a Harsh Mistress.    The length of the RSA key, in bits. var Bits  1024   var MattsRSAkey  cryptico.generateRSAKeyPassPhrase, Bits codepre  pWhen I try to output MattsRSAkey, I only get [Object object]. Its the same when I store it in the Cookies. I tried to use JSON.stringify. With this function I can store and look inside MattsRSAKey. But when I want to use it later to decrypt the message, I get an error, that I have no valid public key. I think the private key got broken while storing it. When I read the private key from Cookies I use JSON.parse.p  pIs there any way to solve my problem I just want to send encrypted messages from multiple users public key to one user private key. My intention is not to have a secure transport but to store the messages encrypted in the database, so that unauthorized persons can not read it. It is important that I do not only have encryption for onetoone messaging. This would be easy, because both users only would need to share a password for encryption.p

Negative 81106 pI want to find images similar to another image. So after researching i found two methods first was two represent the image by its attributes like p  pcodelength  full  pattern  check  color  bluecodep  pbut the limitation of this method is that I will not be able to get an exhaustive dataset with all the features marked.p  pThe second approach I found was to extract features and do feature mapping.  So I decided to use deep convolution neural networks with caffe so that by using any of the exsisting models I could learn the features and then perform feature matching or some other operation.  I just wanted to take a general advice what can be the other methods which are good and worth a try. And since I am just starting out with caffe so can anyone give a general guideline how to approach the problem with caffe  Thanks in advancep  pI looked at phash just was curious that it will find the images which are same like there are minor intensity variations and some other variation wiill it also work to give the same typesemantically like for a tshirt with blue and red stripes will it give black and white stripe as similar and would it consider things like the length of shirt, collar style etcp

My only idea to accomplish this interpolation is to use a linear interpolation similar to a hrefhttpwww.ajdesigner.comphpinterpolationlinearinterpolationequation.php relnofollowhttpwww.ajdesigner.comphpinterpolationlinearinterpolationequation.phpa. After that, I would simply compare the yvalue in mtcars with the interpolated predicted loess yvalue. If the yvalue in mtcars is larger than the predicted loess yvalue, then I keep that original data point else, I remove it.p  pI started to code this, but realize that I cannot do so in an efficient way. One problem is that my real data set which isnt mtcars is very large 40,000 rows First, to do the linear interpolation, I need to find the two x values in the loess fit that are closest to the original x value in my data set if there isnt exactly one perfect match, and I do not know how to do that efficiently without searching through increasing loess xvalues.p  pHow is an efficient way to approach this, for example, testing it out first on the mtcars data set Thank you.p

Negative 81106 pI know there are already similar questions and I gave them a look but I couldnt find an explicit univocal answer to my question. I was just investigating online about these functions and their relationship with memory layers. In particular I found this beautiful a hrefhttpslwn.netArticles457667 relnofollowarticlea that gave me a good insight about memory layers br brp  pimg srchttpslwn.netimages2011jmdataflow.png altmemory layersp  pIt seems that codefflushcode moves data from application to kernel filesystem buffer and its ok, everyone seems to agree on this point. The only thing that left me puzzled was that in the same article they assumed a writeback cache saying that with codefsynccode the data is saved to the stable storage layer and after they added that the storage may itself store the data in a writeback cache, so codefsynccode is still required for files opened with ODIRECT in order to save the data to stable storagep  pReading a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12262454fsyncsyncdoesitreallydowhatitssupposedtoherea and a hrefhttpwww.scs.stanford.edu13wics240notesxsyncfs.txt relnofollowtherea it seems like the truth is that codefsynccode and codesynccode let the data enter the storage device but if this one has caching layers it is just moved here, not at once to permanently storage and data may even be lost if there is a power failure. Unless we have a filesystem with barriers enabled and then codesynccodecodefsynccode and some other operations will cause the appropriate CACHE FLUSH ATA or SYNCHRONIZE CACHE SCSI commands to be sent to the device [from your website a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions12262454fsyncsyncdoesitreallydowhatitssupposedtoanswera]p  pQuestionsp  ol lipif the data to be updated are already in the kernel buffers and my device has a volatile cache layer in writeback mode is it true, like said by the article, that operations like codefsynccode [and codesynccode I suppose] synchronize data to the stable memory layer skipping the volatile one I think this is what happens with a writethrough cache, not a writeback one. From what I read I understood that with a writeback cache on codefsynccode can just send data to the device that will put them in the volatile cache and they will enter the permanent memory only afterpli lipI read that codefsynccode works with a file descriptor and then with a single file while codesynccode causes a total deployment for the buffers so it applies to every data to be updated. And from this a hrefhttpwww.databaseskill.com530512 relnofollowpagea also that codefsynccode waits for the end of the writing to the disk while codesynccode doesnt wait for the end of the actual writing to the disk.

I am  curious that why spring 4 recommend annotation to set up spring rather using configuration file Some people said that the spring configuration file is too complicated.

So why annotation is more applicable than configuration file p

Negative 81106 pI was wondering what is the proper way to test if reason  ADDONUPGRADE works for bootstraped addons Here is the way Im testing it I have two versions 2.1 and 2.2.

I would find myself doing a lot of housekeeping updating well over 1000 records due to a emtypoem or simply wanting to update the codeServiceMenucode name.p  hr  pstrongFilesstrongp  pstrongservicemenu.rbstrongp  precodeclass ServiceMenu lt ActiveRecordBase   hasmany services end codepre  pstrongservice.rbstrongp  precodeclass Service lt ActiveRecordBase   belongsto tech   belongsto servicemenu end codepre  hr  pstrongservicemenuscontroller.rbstrongp  precodedef update     respondto do format   if servicemenu.updateservicemenuparams     format.html  redirectto servicemenu, notice Service menu was successfully updated.    else     positioncount  ServiceMenu.count     format.html  render edit      end end codepre  pstrongservicecontrollerstrongp  precodedef new   service  currenttech.services.build end    def create   service  currenttech.services.buildserviceparams    respondto do format     if service.save       format.html  redirectto service, notice Service was successfully created.        format.json  render show, status created, location service      else       format.html  render new        format.json  render json service.errors, status unprocessableentity      end   end end  codepre  hr  pstrongschemastrongp  precodecreatetable servicemenus, force cascade do t     t.string   name,                      limit 255     t.datetime serviceiconupdatedat     t.integer  serviceiconfilesize,    limit 4     t.string   serviceiconcontenttype, limit 255     t.string   serviceiconfilename,    limit 255     t.integer  position,                  limit 4     t.datetime createdat,                            null false     t.datetime updatedat,                            null false   end     createtable services, force cascade do t     t.string   name,       limit 255     t.integer  techid, limit 4     t.datetime createdat,             null false     t.datetime updatedat,             null false   end     createtable techs, force cascade do t     t.string   email,                  limit 255, default , null false     t.string   username,               limit 255     t.datetime avatarupdatedat     t.integer  avatarfilesize,       limit 4     t.string   avatarcontenttype,    limit 255     t.string   avatarfilename,       limit 255     t.string   encryptedpassword,     limit 255, default , null false     t.string   resetpasswordtoken,   limit 255     t.datetime resetpasswordsentat     t.datetime remembercreatedat     t.integer  signincount,          limit 4,   default 0,  null false     t.datetime currentsigninat     t.datetime lastsigninat     t.string   currentsigninip,     limit 255     t.string   lastsigninip,        limit 255     t.datetime createdat,                                      null false     t.datetime updatedat,                                      null false     t.string   firstname,             limit 255     t.string   lastname,              limit 255  end codepre  hr  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pHow can I perform the task of updating multiple records strongdynamicallystrong in the codeservicescode db to the updated name in the codeServiceMenucode anytime I make a value change In order wordsp  ul liUpdate a record on codeServiceMenucode from the typo emBrakseem to emBrakesemli liAfter updating a record on codeServiceMenucode, Rails would find in the codeservicescode db all the values in the codenamecode column that  emBrakseemli liUpdate all the emBrakseem values in the codenamecode column to emBrakesemli ul  hr  blockquote   pEditp blockquote  pDo something like this any time I update anything on codeServiceMenucode drop down menu.p  precodeif servicemenu.updateservicemenuparams service.update.wherename Old ServiceMenu value which , ie.Brakse, The new ServiceMenu value which is now Brakes codepre  pPlease help on how to accomplish this.

Negative 81106 pI have a function where I need to return 2 lists that are created inside the function in python 3.x. Rather than returning the lists I can rather take the 2 lists as arguments and append whatever info I need in those lists. My other approach would be to return a dictionary with the 2 lists and then get the lists my using the key after the function returns. Both these methods require preparation beforeafter the function call, so Im just wondering if there is a better way of returning the lists, and if not which of these 2 approaches are better.p  pExample code p  precodedef method1list1, list2     do something to lists  def method2     do something to lists     returnlist1 list1, list2 list2  getlistsmethod1     list1  []     list2  []     method1  getlistsmethod2     listdict  method1     list1  listdict[list1]     list2  listdict[list2] codepre  pEdit, method using tuplesp  precodedef method3     create and do something with lists     return list1, list2  getlistsmethod3     list1, list2  method3 codepre

Negative 81106 pSo I have an app and I want a very different layout based on size class. And I thought Id accomplished this today because the storyboard preview showed every device and every size in every orientation doing exactly what it was supposed to do. When I ran this on my device and then the simulator however, the size class seemed not to change as the layout was pretty much the same thing as before. Here is screenshot showing my issue. Please note that the psycho spray painting was done by me not Xcodep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comdnzBm.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdnzBm.png altThis shows the simulator on the left and the storyboard preview on the right. The image view seen in the preview is shown overlapping the slider in the simulator.ap  pSo I was hoping someone could help. In case youre wondering, I did the psycho spray painting to protect some confidential info which I thought was pretty obvious but there you go p  pThanks for reading and thanks in advance for the helpp  pEDITp  pHere is a screenshot of all constraints for the two main size classes. The green and blue objects that are blanked out do correspond. So the blue thing up top is the blue thing in the constraints. The green is label and slider of the same part of the apps functionality which I dont want to reveal. For now all Ill say is that its a music app as you can tell by looking at the photos below.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comJKB7i.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJKB7i.png altCompact Width, Any Heighta a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comaSj2Z.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comaSj2Z.png altAny Width, Compact Heightap

Negative 81106 pIm running through a tutorial on YouTube on how to build a website. It was good info, but the person didnt mention how to make menu buttons work. For example, I have About Me, Favorite Quotes, Portfolio, and Contact Me. My index.html serves as my About Me. I assumed that to make something like Favorite Quotes work, I would need to copypaste index.html into quotes.html and then itd be clickable, but it doesnt work. Looking at the nav tags, I assume that I need to use the classcurrent command, but every tutorial Ive seen them implemented in have used lists. The nav tags in my code dont use lists so I am unsure how to link my html page menus together. p  pHow do I make something like Favorite Quotes be clickable and not send me to the this webpage is not found error I know I have to utilize classcurrent, but I am not sure how to incorporate it in a nonlist environment.

To clarify, everything is clickable, but I am not sure how to use the buttons to send me to a new page.

Negative 81106 pI am using codeMVCcode 5 to render an initial view and Kendo codeMVVMcode with codeWebApicode to populate controls with data.

Negative 81106 pI have to implement a program using the Stack class which allows a user to enter a positive integer,codencode, followed by codencode integers. Then the program should allow the user to enter another integer, codevalcode after which the program should display the last value which is greater than codevalcode. From my understanding of the program, I figured out that it should compare each element from the top of the stack to the codevalcode. Therefore to compare each element to codevalcode, it should iterate through the values in the stack starting from the top. I dont really know how to make this work so would be pleased if I could get any help. Here is my programp  precodeimport java.util. public class MyClass  public static void mainString[] args       Scanner sc new ScannerSystem.in      StackltIntegergt NumsInStack new StackltIntegergt      int n, num, val     System.out.printlnPlease enter n.     nsc.nextInt      forint i0 iltni          numsc.nextInt         NumsInStack.pushnum            System.out.printlnEnter a value.     valsc.nextInt      forint i0 iltNumsInStack.sizei           ifNumsInStack.peekgtval             System.out.printlnThe number greater than val is NumsInStack.peek                     codepre

Negative 81106 pIn this notebook I had Windows 10, Ubuntu and Fedora. After a strongFedora updatestrong, instead of the grub menu, the stronggrub promptstrong started appearing. Ive tried some solutions which suggested to look in what partition the files vmlinuz and initramfs where, and then run the commands linux and initrd all of that in the grub prompt but theyre not found.p  pNow Ive formated the Fedora partitions and installed Linux Mint, thinking that maybe a new OS would fix that, but I was wrong. Every time the notebook boots first the Toshiba logo appears and immediately next the grub prompt. What I have to do to select an OS is press F12 before the grub prompt so that a boot menu appears There I select to boot from the HDD and then I can select from Fedora, Ubuntu, Windows and Ubuntu. If I select Fedora, the grub prompt appears, and if I select Ubuntu, I get the grub menu to choose Ubuntu, Linux mint or Windows.p  pI tried with BootRepair but nothing changed.p  pAny guessesp
Negative 81106 pConsider the following the modelp  precodeclass Storemodels.Model     id  models.CharField     products  JsonFielddefault[]     regexp  models.CharFieldmaxlength255 codepre  pI am using Django REST Framework and I have a serializer which serializes this model for a codeStoreViewcode. p  pI have some validation I would like to enforce. For example, I want codeproductscode to take the form codeidx, optionaltitleycode and I would like to enforce some regex validation for coderegexpcode.p  pHow would I enforce validation for this model in one single place and still get correct error returns. By correct error returns, I mean that I should return a code400 BAD REQUESTcode when I receive some bad payload in from an codeAPIcode client but I should also return a normal Django codeValidationErrorcode if I create an object on the model level.p  pI cant see the advantage of serializer level validation. It appears to me that I would just need to duplicate my validations in the model level if I want to guarantee that a bad object never gets into the DB.p
