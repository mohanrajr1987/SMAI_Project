Positive 28511 pstrongIntroductionstrongp  pHi I need some help. I have a really big issue in unity3d. When stray far away from 0, 0, 0 there are some floatingpoint precision issues, and that its normal.p  pstrongThe Complete Explanation Of The Problemstrongp  pIf i create 2 cubes or more in the scene and i place one in another as a child with a distance between them and i go far away in the scene, the 2 cube will  and they are not able to keep the child are not able to keep the good distance.p  pFor exemple a rigged model will be the best example for show a view of the importance of that problem.p  pemHeres an like from an youtube videoem youtube.comwatchvfqeEKE0p90Ep  pstrongUnderstanding The Problemstrongp  pWhy the child object arent able to keep the correct distance to the parent.p  pIn unity3d the vector take float parameters. The float have a precision to only 7 digits.p  pThe mathematic formule to calculate that distance called magnitude itsp  precodepoint Ax, y, z  A20, 20, 20 point Bx, y, z  B10, 10, 10  magnitude  AxBx2  AyBy2  AzBz2 magnitude  20102  20102  20102 magnitude  102  102  102 magnitude  100  100  100 magnitude  300 magnitude  17.32050807568877... codepre  pSo the float have only 7 digits of precision, that mean all of the decimals situated after the 7th digit will be erased. That mean, the child object doesnt keeped the exact position.p  pstrongSolving the problemstrongp  pI am 100 shore than there are a lot of ways to fix that, but personally i dont have any idea how to do it.p  pRust have a ViewModel system. Its something that recalculate the position or display the 3d model correctly or i dont know but it work very well.p  pstrongRust team explain a bit his ViewModel System herestrong http garry.tv20140407unityviewmodelsp  pI have made an injector for rust for checking how it work in the scene. There are a GameObject called View Model Root It have attached to it the ViewModel script.The View Model Root contains also some 3d models. I dont know more that that.p  pstrongImportant Informationsstrongp  pemI have decompiled Rust and i have uploaded all of source code on GitHub.emp  pemRUST SOURCE CODE HERE em a hrefhttpsgithub.comHexHashLegacyRust relnofollowhttpsgithub.comHexHashLegacyRustap  pThe principals classes for the ViewModel System arep  precodeCameraFX.cs, ICameraFX.cs, ViewModel.cs, MountedCamera.cs, MountCamera.cs, ViewModelAttachment.cs, ViewModelTester.cs, VMAttachmentSocketOverride.cs, ItemRepresentation.cs, IHeldItem.cs, etc... codepre  pemHere are some screenshots of result of the injectorem a hrefhttppastebin.comBEgz2vf6 relnofollowhttppastebin.comBEgz2vf6ap  pI need help, its very important if i cant fix that problem i cant continue my project.

Positive 28511 pI am writing a managed Unity3d plugin which handles some web requests, registration and downloading content from the web.

Something like the follwing line of code does not work, obviouslyp  precodeMyManagedPlugin.RequestDataAsyncCallback codepre  pI also would like to avoid any thread specific code on the unity3d side meaning in the scripts so that all the async calls are encapsulated in the managed plugin.

Positive 28511 pIm working with Unity 5 and the Smart Merge tool a tool that helps you to merge files that would otherwise be hard to merge. For this tool to work, you have to change a setting in Unity that will ensure that those files are serialised as text, rather than being binary. This is fine, and Ive turned that on in the two branches that I want to merge and now all those assets are serialised as text.p  pHowever, when I go to merge, I get errors when the Smart Merge tool tries to look at the base versions of those files. These versions of the files are from the common ancestor of the branches Im trying to merge. Of course, since I only turned on the text serialisation recently for merging, the files from the common ancestor are binary and the merge tool cant handle them.p  pIs there any way I can work around this I thought maybe this would be possible through git, so I posted here instead of on the gamedev StackExchange site. p

Positive 28511 pIm developing a Tower defense in 2D in Unity.p  pIm trying to calculate a parabola to draw the trajectory of the projectiles fired from a tower in the game. Ive got the position of the tower and the position of the enemy  now I need an algorithm that calculates a parabola that will hit the enemy.p  pIs there a universal algorithm or something like that for this kind of calculationp
Positive 28511 pI am to make a mobile painting game in Unity and Ive encountered a serious problem the Input class in Unity is framedependent. Thus I cant get the position of touch frequent enough to make my application draw smoothly as a result I get something like just points on the background, not connected between each other.p  pI tried to just connect the points that are detected in Unity, and than my result was just the same points connected with lines, of course. I was trying this in Unity Editor with about 180200 fps, and on mobile phone with 3050 fps it looks even worse. I expect that I have to get the touch positions somehow in android studio or Xcode, and only then use them in my C code in Unity editor.p  pAm I thinking right to use extern from Unity tools, or there is another easier way to do it directly in Unity If there is none and I am right, can somebody give me some links to guidestutorials how to do it and integrate it with Unity I have never worked outside of Unity and have no experience in integration some external tools with it.p  pNote Ive tried FixedUpdate without any luck  it doesnt matter how often I try to get the position variables, it is about how often they are updated I also tried Event.current.mousePositionin unity editor in OnGUI method, but it also gave me no difference.p  pUpd As I have already said, I need to get positions more frequently than the Input class gives me. It updates not fast enough Heres what I get without connecting the points. The image shows the mousePosition detection frequency in 180200 fps.

When the right button is pressed the camera is moved right by 1920 pixels which shows each levelworld in turn.p  pNow I want a world select button on each of these sections so I have placed a second canvas set to worldview. and then i have placed panels on each section each with a button in. The panels are set to not interactive via a canvasgroup and are made interactive when brought into view. p  pMy issue is that if I am on say the left button and I press right it does not navigate to the middle button, it navigates to the right button, then if I press right again it navigates to the centre button.....p  pHow do I get it to navigate naturally from left to centre to right bearing in mind that the centre button is whichever one is currently visible p
Positive 28511 pIm making a 2d boardgamestyle game in Unity 5, and I have a prefab made up of a couple of sprites which represents a game piece.  I want some text in my prefab that I can update as the game progresses.  p  pIf i try to add text, it requires a canvas, but when I create a canvas, an extraordinarily enormous canvas is created, that looks to be at least 1000x times bigger than by camera area.  If I try to place this canvas inside my prefab, my prefab is now made of an enormously huge canvas, and my tiny sprite images.  This makes the prefab impossible to position, or calculate sizing or animate, or anything else I want to do.p  pHow can I add text to a prefab, and make the text contained within the size of my prefab spitesp  pHeres what I have tried so far  p  ul lipif I set the canvas for the text to Render Mode World Space Im able to make its rect tranform smaller.  However, if I get it as small as my sprites, the text becomes an unreadably blurry mess.  I guess this happens because my sprites are literally at emleastem 1000x smaller than the canvas, so when I zoom in enough to even see the sprites, the text has been zoomed into oblivion.  My sprites are so much smaller than the canvas, that if I am zoomed out to see the full canvas, my sprites are not even visible.  pli lipIm able to kind of make things work if I recreate my prefab using UI Images instead of sprites.  This way, the UI Images, and the text are both UI elements contained in the enormous canvas, so the size disparity doesnt exist.  However, I dont know what the pitfalls are going to be trying to build an entire game out of ui images instead of sprites.  Do I get all the state capabilities of spritespli ul
Positive 28511 pI have a project in mind where two displays are connected to the same application. The first display does the processing and renders the scene, while sending instructions to the second display over Wifi which also renders a part of the scene.p  pI would like this to be easy to integrate in Unity projects which run on Android and iOS platforms iOS being one of the receiving displays. p  pI was thinking this would be possible by streaming video, but there would be a noticeable delay and more importantly heavy processing involved.p  pMy second thought would be to stream OpenGL calls to the second device, which would at least remove the heavy processing. This has been done before with projects called Chromium and ClusterGL.p  pI am wondering however if Unity can allow for such an application or that the OpenGL calls are obscured. Is this possible with the Native Plugin Interface a hrefhttpdocs.unity3d.comManualNativePluginInterface.html relnofollowhttpdocs.unity3d.comManualNativePluginInterface.htmla p  pemEditem As a followup, does Unity allow for multiple rendering contextsp

Negative 28511 pAlmost everyday I see new stuffs coming out of Beta or CTP releases from Microsoft. It used to be exciting but the list of products and technologies is getting bigger and bigger everyday. WPF, WF, Silverlight, Powershell, SSIS, SSDS, EF, LINQ, WCF, Data Services, XAML, Asp.Net AJAX, Asp.Net MVC blah blah.. p  pSince I am in a Technical role like most of you, fundamental knowledge or just familiarity is not enough.  I need to dig a little deeper into all the new technologies, try out prototypes and check if everything fits together, considering lots of other critical factors like Business, technology maturity, environment and people.  Not to mention comparison with other competing technologies for convincing my team.p  pIn some cases, you have to be strongly aware of concepts like REST and how it is different from SOAP. In other cases, you have to get your hands dirty for workflow solutions using WF. Again, one fine day you find that stuffs like WinFS is completely erased from the map and getting evolved into something different.p  pOne of the earliest warning I got for not updating my skills was when I was a bit slow to adopt SQL 2005.

Even the 3.5 SP1 has a bunch of new features.p  pI admit I love gathering knowledge but was wondering if there are efficient ways of managing and absorbing all this information without affecting normal work schedule. My question is how do you all manage this information overload One thing I have done is setting a filter. I loved reading hardware review sites as a hobby but now totally cut them off from my list.

Pretty black and white.p  pstrongSolution 3 codeUITextViewcodestrongp  pMy third attempt was to add a codeUITextViewcode as a subview of the table cell.p  pThe only thing that this doesnt solve is the fact that detected URLs cannot be handled by me. The text view uses codeUIApplicationcodes codeopenURLcode method which quits my app and launched Safari.p  pAlso, as the table view can get quite large, the number of codeUITextViewcodes added as subviews cause a noticeable performance drag on scrolling throughout the table, especially on iPhone 3G era devices because of the creation, layout, compositing whenever a cell is scrolled on screen, etc.p  pSo my question to all you knowledgeable folk out there is What can I dop  pWould a codeUIWebViewcode be the best option Aside from a performance drag, I think a webview would solve all the above issues, and if I remember correctly, back in the 2.0 days, the Apple documentation actually recommended web views where text formatting  hyperlinks were required.p  pCan anyone think of a way to achieve this without a performance dragp  pMany thanks in advance to everyone who can help.p

The next best thing would be to tell reciever.aspx to fire a javascript method.p  pIve tried to create a codehttpmodulecode to try to hook something up, but failed.p  pBest other solution Ive seen so far is to actually by jquery do a ajax post every x seconds. But this is defenatly NOT what I want. I want to fire it when it needs to be fired when the serverside event fires.p  pSolutions working with IIS6 or IIS7, any is fine, but its ASP.NET 3.5 and not MVC.p  pAny ideasp  pEdit apparently doesnt stackoverflows tag public delegates... p

Negative 28511 pI am using jquery 1.3.2.p  pI am registering two handlers as followsp  precodedocument.onmousedowndochandler  element.clickelemhandler codepre  pWhen I click on element both the handlers get called.

Negative 28511 pThere are a lot of flexible, complete, crossplatform, emet ceteraem, graphical user interface frameworks. Most of them provide many tools to turn software development easier.

Negative 28511 pWe have a number of webservers15 and for each server have a number of URLs30. I have written a Windows Desktop app that goes out and hits each server and each url combo. using the httpWebRequest.Proxy to do this. Its usually just for 2 servers at a time. So a total of 60 requests.p  pThe first problem was the 2 connection limit, so I added this to the Form Load ServicePointManager.DefaultConnectionLimit  500p  pThat helped, but then I seem to run into another limit.p  pAfter we roll code out for these sites, they can take a while to respond. The init process takes like 3040 seconds Thats another story though.p  pBut there seems to be a Windows XP connection limit. If I have IE open and am trying to access a site, while I a running my app to check sites, the IE takes a long time until it gets a page back. Once the app starts getting requests back and closes them, then IE gets its response back as well.p  pAlso the page we are calling gives us back timings of how long it took to call other WebService calls. These times are sometimes slow, but sometimes quite fast. I have a timer on each HTTP Request I make that starts the timer once I make the request. Sometime the difference between the pages specified response time and the HTTP requests timer is quite large, like 40 seconds.p  pSo what I think is happening is the request is being queued up and its timer is running, but has not yet been sent to the page.p  pDoes anyone know what I would need to change to increase the total connection limit in Windows XP I have read about registry changes or tcpip.sys editing, but would like a definitive answer from the wise and intelligent group at Stackoverflow.p  pThanks and I hope this makes sense.p

Negative 28511 pI need to split a string and extract words separated by whitespace characters.The source may be in English or Japanese. English whitespace characters include tab and space, and Japanese text uses these too. IIRC, all widelyused Japanese character sets are supersets of USASCII.p  pSo the set of characters I need to use to split my string includes normal ASCII space and tab.p  pBut, in Japanese, there is another space character, commonly called a fullwidth space. According to my Macs Character Viewer utility, this is U3000 IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE. This is usually what results when a user presses the space bar while typing in Japanese input mode.p  pAre there any other characters that I need to consider p  pI am processing textual data submitted by users who have been told to separate entries with spaces.  However, the users are using a wide variety of computer and mobile phone operating systems to submit these texts. Weve already seen that users may not be aware of whether they are in Japanese or English input mode when entering this data. p  pFurthermore, the behavior of the space key differs across platforms and applications even in Japanese mode e.g., Windows 7 will insert an ideographic space but iOS will insert an ASCII space.p  pSo what I want is basically the set of all characters that visually look like a space and might be generated when the user presses the space key, or the tab key since many users do not know the difference between a space and a tab, in Japanese andor English.p  pIs there any authoritative answer to such a questionp

I want to use some of the WinDbg commands like vad  for that I need other dlls like exts.dll, ext.dll, kext.dll, kexts.dll. I have all these dlls and have my NTDEBUGGEREXTENSIONPATH properly set.

Also when I try to load these dlls using Execute .load....  it throws an error   The call to LoadLibrary... failed, Win32 error 0n193. I tried load as well  both of them didnt work in my code.

Negative 28511 pFrom what I see if I write in the etcnginxvhostsdefault the effect will be server wide contrary to per domain confs. I cant seem to know how to write a rule to redirect from index.html or dirindex.html ro  or dir to have server wide effects.p  pThe thing is that running on CentOS makes files in homeuserpublichtml and from nginx I cant see the user part to use it in the root directive. I thought of something like thisp  precode server  listen 111.111.111.11180            fake IP servername                        this to take in all hosts...  root home.publichtml        this . would contain the user part rewrite .index.htmlhtm httphost1 permanent   codepre  pAs you can see.. probably.. Im trying to make that redirect work for all sites without having to manually edit each specific per domain conf file but rather have it in the etcnginxvhostsdefault conf file.p  pAny help is much appreciated p  pThank youp

Negative 28511 pHopefully I can articulate my question well enough to get some clear and usable feedback here. I have reports like paper reports in my .NET application that have data bound to them. Typically the reports are a combination of many data elements across several busniess entites that may not all relate through an Inheritance hierarcy, etc. This makes it difficult to get all the needed data placed together to bind to the report.p  pSo what I emhaveem done before are make Report classes with data elements specific to supporting the reports they are bound to, and on the back end might be tied to specially created Stored Procedures that bring this data back maybe several joins across many tables to get the emrightem data needed. So if I was to make an analogy to the database world, I am essentially denormailizing the data structure to get all of this data into a single class to make it easy to bind to the report.p  pHowever on the hard line OOP concepts and architecture design, one could say that a report is just another thing to bind data to, and its class should not be designed just to suit the needs of data binding. In this thought process, I would actually need to make my class design be able to create the relationships needed to get all of the data together properly to still be bound, but not create any emspecialem Report classes. I find this difficult to do sometimes. It is much easier to create these relationships in the back end stored procedures and then just output the resultset to be almost immediately bound to the report.p  pSo what is the emrightem way to solve this If I create these specialized report classes with really no behavior, am I introducing an antipattern like the Anemic Domain Modelp  pI could use some feedback, and please speak up if my question and scenarios did not make sense. Thanksp

Negative 28511 pIve written some JavaScript that uses XMLHttpRequest to fetch a large amount of XML documents from a remote server. To do this, Ive created a variable that the response of my request is stored in. I parse each response for the data Im interested it. Then, I loop back and run the function again, with a different URL. My understanding was that because I used the same variable to store the XML, each document would overwrite the one before it. However, Windows Task Manger reveals that the memory used by Internet Explorer continues to grow, presumably from cached versions of the nowmeaningless documents.p  pHow can I prevent IE from storing all of the documents Is there a way to clear this cache every now and thenp
Negative 28511 pIm developing an Android market for my thesis, and I need a recommendations system to order my app.p  pBasically for each app I have an average grade given by users, downloads number, how many times people have been looking app details, and a couple of other fields. I would like to find an algorithm that generates an average score based on the 45 fields, and order apps based on this score I can do the ordering part, so that the apps are listed and suggested based on this score.p  pI know that creating your own system is really complicated, there are thesis bases only on recommendation system, but thats is definitely not part of my thesis, I cant simply order applications only considering the feedback given by users. I need an algorithm or a function that consider 45 fields together and generate a score like in the real Android market, or Amazon, or Apple store etc. It doesnt have to be that good, just fair enough.p  pCan you suggest an algorithm ready to be used. It doesnt matter how good or innovate it is of course it should be not a paleolithic one. I dont know exactly what and where to look for it.p  pIt would be nice to find 2 such algorithms.p  ol liThe first one simply orders apps based on some fields. The same order for everyone. So not really a recommendation system cause it doesnt care about user info.li ol  pExample I have an app in my database with an average vote of 3 on 5 stars, 250 downloads, 2500 people visiting the page and something else. I would like an algorithm that weights this fields and generate a score N and then in my DB when I ask for a list of 20 apps I order those according to this score. Some suggestions or ideasp  ol liAnd the second based on a couple of fields more, for example category and sub category of each app ordering or given different score based on users and based also on user profile, like age, sex, country so that I can consider what people with similar profile have downloaded and suggest it to other users.li ol  pAnyway something easy and quick to integrate with my easyphp infrastructure. I have a MySQL database.... Does a recommendation or filtering system need a special engine or additional staffp

Negative 28511 pI have two tables that get joined regularly.p  pTable One is about 1 Million rows and grows daily. Table Two is always about 200k less than Table One.  Furthermore, Table Two is truncated and repopulated every night from a report downloaded from an outside service. The UPDATE..JOIN query I use isnt too speedy, so Im looking for a possible remedy.p  pTable Ones structurep  precodeI grow daily and currently am around 1 million rows. CREATE TABLE tableone  id INT NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,  sku VARCHAR30,   otherone VARCHAR30,  PRIMARY KEYid  codepre  pTable Twos structurep  precodeI get truncated every night and am about 200k less rows than Table One. CREATE TABLE tabletwo  id INT NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT,  sku VARCHAR30,   othertwo INT,  PRIMARY KEYid  codepre  pNote that the otherone and othertwo fields on both tables are just there to demonstrate that each table has fields mostly varchar beyond id and sku but there are actually many different columns on each table.  Im not sure it matters but SKU is unique on table two and but only unique about 95 of the time on table one.  Because of this, uniqueness is not enforced on either table in MySQL.p  pSo here is my workflow and questionp  p1 A bunch of new rows get added to Table One during the day.br 2 Each night Table Two is truncated all rows deletedbr 3 A report is downloaded from a third party as a CSV flatfile.  That report is then loaded into Table Two using a LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE command.br 4 3 queries are run that update Table One data and involve a JOIN.  They all look very similar to this  p  precodeUPDATE tableone t1 JOIN tabletwo t2 ON t2.sku  t1.sku SET t1.otherone  Other two was greater than zero WHERE t1.otherone IS NULL AND t2.othertwo gt 0 codepre  pWith the number of rows I have, doing JOINs between these two tables seems to take up quite a bit of time.  I was curious as to, with 3 heavy update queries, would it be best to create some index for these tables.  The issue being that these indexes would most likely have to be recreated each night when Table Two gets populated.  I dont know how this might affect population speed nor do I know which type of index I should use.p

I would need to export the wholeparts of the graph to high resolution still images, since screenshots look hideous when printed especially if the graph has been zoomed out. p  pThe code I use currently is as follows p  precodepublic void writeToDiskFile saveToFolder, String filename      Dimension loDims  getGraphLayout.getSize     Dimension vsDims  getSize      int width  vsDims.width     int height  vsDims.height     Color bg  getBackground      BufferedImage im  new BufferedImagewidth,height,BufferedImage.TYPEINTBGR     Graphics2D graphics  im.createGraphics     graphics.setColorbg     graphics.fillRect0,0, width, height     paintComponentgraphics      try        ImageIO.writeim,png,new FilesaveToFolder,filename     catchException e         e.printStackTrace       codepre  pThis creates PNG images which are not particularly high resolution. So my questions are as followsp  ol liIs it possible to push up the PNG export resolution to 300 dpili liIs it possible to export the graph, or any swing component for that matter, to vector based formats such as EPS, PDF or SVG without too much hassle I have found several libraries a hrefhttptrac.erichseifert.devectorgraphics2dVectorGraphics2Da,a hrefhttpjava.freehep.orgvectorgraphicsindex.htmlFreeHEPa for managing vector based images in Java, however I am not sure if using them would mean that I have to redraw each vertex and edge in the graph. Thats obviously not very desirable... li liAre there any other alternatives which I might have missedli ol  pThanks in advance,p

Negative 28511 pI have a 2D figure made from straight lines.p  pThe figures edges have coordinates from type double. The coordinates values are stored in an object called Dot.p  pThe data related to a line is the line ascending  or descending, the values of a and b in a  X  b  Y etc. is stored in an object called Line. The Line class also has two Dot objects for the two ends of every line. The Line class also has 2 functionsmethods and one constructor. The constructor has no arguments. The first functionmethod has no arguments and the second one has. Both functionsmethods are created in order to change all the data automatically when ever necessary.p  pI insert the number of the sides of the figure and the coordinates of the edges after I start the program. Later the program has to write on the screen everything about every line. No matter what coordinates I insert, the coordinates of the first dot are X  9,25596e061 and Y  9,25596e061. But the other dots have the coordinates I have originally inserted.p  pThere is one line that I add to a vector as much times as the number of the sides of the figure. After that I start changing the values of the coordinates of the edges of the figure by inserting the values in the running program. The third action is to call the functionmethod that creates the lines It calculates the rest of the data about the line. The fourth step of the program is to write on the screen the data about every line.p  pI have been searching for a problem in the algorithm and the code. I havent found anything.p  pIm using Visual C 2010 Express. I am also using the iostream and vector libraries.p  pSo why are the X and Y coordinates of the first edge changing their values to 9,25596e061p

Negative 28511 pIn Scala versions prior to 2.9.0, concrete function implementations in traits were compiled as normal methods. From 2.9.x onward, they are compiled as bridge methods. Im trying to find the reasoning behind this change, because it negatively affects users of many popular Java frameworks like Spring and Jersey.p  pConsider the following Scala codep  precodetrait Speaks    def speak       printlnwoof      class Dog extends Speaks    def wag       printlnwag wag     codepre  pWhen the Dog class is compiled with scalac version 2.8.1 and decompiled with javap, the result for the speak and wag functions look like thisp  precodepublic void speak     flags ACCPUBLIC     Code       stack1, locals1, argssize1          0 aload0                 1 invokestatic  11                  Method Speaksclass.speakLSpeaksV          4 return               LineNumberTable         line 7 0  public void wag     flags ACCPUBLIC     Code       stack2, locals1, argssize1          0 getstatic     18                  Field scalaPredef.MODULELscalaPredef          3 ldc           20                  String wag wag          5 invokevirtual 24                  Method scalaPredef.printlnLjavalangObjectV          8 return               LineNumberTable         line 9 0 codepre  pWhen Dog is compiled with scalac version 2.9.1 and again decompiled, the same two functions look likep  precodepublic void speak   flags ACCPUBLIC, ACCBRIDGE   Code     stack1, locals1, argssize1        0 aload0               1 invokestatic  11                  Method Speaksclass.speakLSpeaksV        4 return             LineNumberTable       line 7 0  public void wag   flags ACCPUBLIC   Code     stack2, locals1, argssize1        0 getstatic     18                  Field scalaPredef.MODULELscalaPredef        3 ldc           20                  String wag wag        5 invokevirtual 24                  Method scalaPredef.printlnLjavalangObjectV        8 return             LineNumberTable       line 9 0 codepre  pThe problematic part is the addition of the ACCBRIDGE flag to the speak function. Frameworks like Jersey and Spring intentionally do not recognize bridge methods in many cases as workarounds for other issues.p  pSo can anyone explain or point to a good explanation of why this change was made in Scala 2.9.x p  pAs a followup, is there a way to disable this behavior through a function annotation, compiler flag, etcp
Negative 28511 pIn CC how can my programs determine if there is a desktop system or remote or not  p  pMy project has three separate programs running now in separate gnometerminals.  It is launched by the last line of .profile, so it starts whether I am at the system desktop gnome or remotely connecting by VPNtelnet or VPNremotedesktop.  My machine is 250 miles away at a test site, so I frequently login remotely to make changes and have to restart the program.p  pId like my program to be able to detect that it is launched from a desktop environment or from a telnet session.  Preferably, I want them to continue running after the remote connection is broken.p  pObviously, I need to make my programs into daemons so they will persist after I close the connection.   But if I start them in a terminal on a desktop environment, where I can actually have three terminals open, Id like to watch their progress messages.  And if I disconnect the remote desktop, Id like the daemons to detect this and turn off printing to the now killed terms but keep on running in normal silent daemon mode.  Best of all, the programs could recheck for a desktop occasionally and resume printing by opening new terminals.p  pIs this possible  Any coding suggestionsp  pThanks in advance.    p

Negative 28511 pI am a beginner in Java . The first thing I learned was the main method of an executable class should be strongpublicstrong and the reason given was since this method will be called by the emJVMem it should be visible outside the class and hence should be public. Now while studying serialization I find that the codewriteObjectcode and codereadObjectcode private methods of a codeSerializablecode class can be called by the JVM while serializing and deserializing an object  If they are private methods then how can JVM call them  If it can then why it cant call the main method p  pAfter flipping through some java documentation , I read this line  JVM can access private methods of an object  . Since we call readObject using an instance of ObjectInputStream so it is accessible to JVM , whereas main method being a static or class method and called without instantiating any object of the class should be public in order to be accessible to JVM  Does that make sense  I dont know .p

Negative 28511 pI have a codeViewControllercode class that has a property that is the model which I want to observe as properties on the model change.  Within my model object I have a property that is periodically updated in the background of my application.  As it updates, I need to execute code within my codeViewControllercode.p  pTo do this, I create an observer on my model from within my codeViewControllercode codeviewDidLoadcode method.p  precode[ModelObject addObserverself                forKeyPathState                   optionsNSKeyValueObservingOptionNew                   contextnil] codepre  pAs you can see, this is nothing special and the observation method behaves as it should so long as I leave the view displayed on my screen.  If I remove the above view from the parent view, I get an codeEXCBADACCESScode error message when my codeModelObjectcode instance codeModecode property changes.  Specifically, my app crashes at the line that is updating the codeModecode property and I receive the mostly useless codeEXCBADACCESScode on the following line of code within the ModelObject instance.p  precodeThis is located in a method that periodically toggles the value of State [self setState 2] codepre  pI would assume the solution to this problem is to call code[ModelObject removeObserver self forKeyPathState]code from somewhere within my codeViewControllercode when it is removed from its parent subview array.  However, I have added that line of code within my codeviewDidUnloadcode method but Ive found the the codeviewDidUnloadcode method isnt being called.  Im not sure if that is the right place, but it needs to go some where.p  pWhat might I be doing incorrectly  I know the problem is KVO related because if I remove the observation, the application works without any problem.  My model instance can toggle this value as much as it wants and my application never crashes.  What should I do to be sure that my observer is removed correctly when the observing view is being removed from its parents subview arrayp

Application A a game like Diablo III or Civilization V attempts to read or right from file A the game save, application B the save repository detects this readwrite request and pipes the request through itself preforming the request on file B the actual game save in another location.

Negative 28511 pIn many languages, including the C family, initialization and assignment are both spelled codecode. In languages that dont formally distinguish between them, Im considering the first assignment to a variable to be its initialization.p  pWhich is more common in typical mainstream languages Eyeballing some chunks of open source code doesnt give a clear answer, and its tricky trying to distinguish them with a regular expression. Id be happy with statistics from particular code bases, e.g. in the Linux kernel there are X occurrences of the assignment operator, of which Y are actually initialization.p  pThe reason I ask is Im designing a language that needs to distinguish between them, and Im wondering whether to do as the ML family does and give initialization the shorter spelling, or vice versa.p
Negative 28511 pLets say I have a REST method to update a record. That would obviously be a POST because its updating a resource. However in the same motion, a new record in an audit or revision history table needs to be created.p  pIs there a standard or best practice here, of whether to use POST or PUTp  pDoes the REST method come from what is happening on the user side, or does it come from what happens in the databasep  pOne possibility is to call just one method, which updates a record in one table and creates a new record in another table.p  pAnother possibility would be to force that the POST only updates one table, and would require an additional method to do a PUT in the audit table. This forces the use of 2 methods and puts the responsibility on the developer, which Im not too keen on.p

Negative 28511 pI have two entities in Doctrine 2.1 codeCategorycode and codeSitecode each category has many sites and each site has a parent category.p  pI would like to make a single update query in DQL which will update a field called codecountcode of the Category entity with the number of related sites.p  pSo in SQL I would do something like thisp  precodeUPDATE categories c SET c.count  SELECT COUNTs.id FROM sites s WHERE s.categoryid  c.id codepre  pThis would work beautifuly, in DQL it might something like thisp  precodeUPDATE PackageNameBundleCategory c SET c.count  SELECT COUNTs.id FROM PackageNameBundleSite s WHERE s.category  c codepre  pSuch attempt raises code[Syntax Error] line 0, col 61 Error Expected Literal, got SELECTcode.p  pSubqueries DO work in DQL, but the problem here as far as I see it is that Doctrine cannot assign the returned value from the subquery, to the codec.countcode. This is understandable since I might fetch more than 1 field in the subquery and even more than one row. It magicaly works in MySQL since it sees one row, one field and for convenience returns a single integer value. Doctrine on the other hand has to be object oriented and has to work with different engines where such convertions might not be supported.p  pFinally, my question isp  pWhat is the best way to do this in Doctrine, should I go with Native SQL or it can be done with DQL and howp  pThanks in advancep  pEDIT I just found this quote in the DQL Docsp  ul liemReferences to related entities are only possible in the WHERE clause and using subselects.emli ul  pSo, I guess assigning anything but a scalar value is impossiblep  pThe main question remains though..p

Negative 28511 pSo unlike most of the results Ive seen. Im trying to do the exact opposite. Retain html tags that I get through a form. While displaying the immediate form contents, gives me what I want, I need to take the form contents and readd it to an existing HTML page. p  pTo do that, Im reading in the html page using DOMDocument, then finding the appropriate place, where I want to insert the new batch of information submitted through the form, then create a bunch of elements and add in that new batch. Problem is when I try to createElement and give it the value of my submitted information any html tags in that information is not converted to html, but has the tags on them.p  pExbr POST[content]  codelta hrefcontact.htmlgtContact US Hereltagtcode p  pActual PHP Code 1  p  precodecontent  domgtcreateElementdiv,POST[content] contentareagtappendChildcontent domgtsaveHTMLFiletest.html codepre  pOutput 1  codelta hrefcontact.htmlgtContact US Hereltagtcodep  pIve tried creating a Text Node.

Negative 28511 pAlright, so Im fairly new to PHP and SQLMySQL so any help is appreciated.p  pI feel like I took the right approach. I searched php.net for MySQL show all table names, it returned a deprecated method and suggested using a MySQL query on codeSHOW TABLES [FROM dbname] [LIKE pattern]code Im not sure what pattern means but, I searched for SQL Wildcard and got the  symbol.

Negative 28511 pIn my ASP.NET application, i have a procedure that log all exceptions to a file using codeApplicationErrorcode and codeglobal.asaxcode. Inside that procedure, I log several things like current datetime, user name and such.p  pIt works well, however, if someone that is already logged try to access a page that doesnt exists eg  a hrefhttpwww.mywebsite.comfoo.aspx relnofollowhttpwww.mywebsite.comfoo.aspxa current user name information cannot be accessed from procedure, because codeSystem.Web.HttpContext.Current.Sessioncode is null. At first, i was thinking that session has been lost. it is not true, because if i press back i can still use the website links still works without being redirected to login page. p  pstrongWhat is the reason of session being null if a ressource is not found strong is it because session object is only initialized by asp after he know which page to deliver  or maybe something is not configurated correctly on my website p

Negative 28511 pAll the possible distinct sums mean that the sums of any one, two, three to nthe length of the array number in an array.      For example, if the given array is [2,2,3]     the sums of one number in the array is the array itself [2,2,3]     the sums of any two numbers in the array is [4,5]     the sums of three numbers in the array is [7]     Therefore, the result should be the combination of all possible sums, which is [2,3,4,5,7]     Just the thoughts of the algorithm please, no need for specific code.

Negative 28511 pI think Im probably looking at this the complete wrong way. I have a stored procedure that returns a potentially large, but usually not result set. That set gets put into a table on the web via PHP. Im going to implement some AJAX for stuff like dynamic reordering and things. The stored procedure takes one to two seconds to run, so it would be nice if I could store that final table somewhere that I can access it faster once its been run. More specifically, the SP is a search function so I want the user to be able to do the search, but then run an codeORDER BYcode on the returned data without having to redo the whole search to get that data again.p  pWhat comes to mind is if there is a way to get results from the stored procedure without it terminating, so I can use a temp table. I know I could use a permanent table, but then Id run into trouble if two people were trying to use it at the same time.p

Negative 28511 pIm new to Scala from Java and I like to develop TDDBDD. So before knowing much about Scala Ive already dived into Scalatest.p  pIm wondering what you think is a good access strategy for unit testing, from the viewpoint that you want to test as much as possible.p  pSuppose I have a class World that I want to test and a class Agent that should not know everything about the World.p  precodepackage program    package world      class World        private var notForAgent       def forAgentDuringActing        forAgentDuringActing has an important side effect in notForAgent             package agent      class Agent      would call World.forAgentDuringActing       package world.test      class WorldSpec extends FunSpec        describeThe world          itshould have sideeffect behaviour when the agent acts on it             ... the test ...                          codepre  pNote that these package declarations are not sacred to me. What I really would like, is that WorldSpec would be something like a companion object to World, so that it can test for the side effect.p  pI thought maybe access modifier qualifiers would help. I could say codeprivate[world] notForAgentcode, but that really is more access than I would like. What I actually would like is something like codeprivate[this, test.WorldSpec] notForAgentcode, but I dont think multiple qualifiers are allowed.p  pWhat would you do to make this testable Alternatively, can you indicate where my thoughts go in the wrong directionp  pp.s. I know the statement never test privates. But I also know the opinion Testing is more important than the code itself. Alter access modifiers if its needed for testing. However, I would like to avoid that discussion in this thread.p

For example a day might contain 3 activities the users should perform. maybe activity 1 starts at 9am,activity 2 at 1130am and lastly activity 3 at 3pm. Therefore the event is in one block spanning from 9am3pm. I would like to customize this block and show each activity when they start and maybe to indicate how long an activity take, I might have to include different background colors for each.p  pNote I would like to create only one event, and style in to show this activities.Just like in a meeting in real life, you have one meetingevent and several agendas.p  pAny idea and contribution is highly appreciated.

Negative 28511 pIs it possible to compute an array which depends on the past values i.e., lesser indexes, in Repa  Initial parts of the array e.g., codea[0]code is given.  Note that I am using Clike notation to indicate an element of array please dont confuse.p  pI read the a hrefhttpwww.haskell.orghaskellwikiNumericHaskell3aARepaTutorial relnofollowtutoriala and quickly check the hackage but I could not find a function to do it.p  pI guess doing this kind of computation in 1D array does not make sence in Repa because you cant parallelize it.  But I think you can parallelize it in 2 or more dimensional case.p  pstrongEDITstrong Probably I should be more specific about what kind of codefcode I want to use.  As there is no way to parallelize in the case codea[i]code is a scalar, lets focus on the case codea[i]code is a N dim vector.  I dont need codea[i]code to be higher dimensional such as matrix because you can unroll it to a vector.  So, codefcode is a function which maps RN to RN.p  pMost of the case, its like thisp  precodeb  M a[i1] a[i][j]  gb[j] codepre  pwhere codebcode is a N dim vector, codeMcode is a N by N matrix no assumption for sparseness, and codegcode is some nonlinear function.  And I want to compute it for codei1,..N1code given codea[0]code, codegcode and codeMcode.  My hope is that there are some generic way to 1 parallelize this type of calculation and 2 make allocation of intermediate variables such as codebcode efficient in Clike language, you can just reuse it, it would be nice if Repa or similar library can do it like a magic without breaking purity.p

Negative 28511 pLooking at the source code for the stock Calendar app, Google uses an IntentService to do the content provider operations for the database. Is there an advantage to using an IntentService rather than a AsyncQueryHandlerp  pI thought that since a Handler is tied to the UI, if the activity gets paused or stopped, the Handler would also get paused. However, this doesnt seem to be the case I created a simple content provider and AsyncQueryHandler that do nothing but run through a long for loop. When I launch other apps or kill the activity, the for loop still runs.p  pSo is the advantage of using an IntentService for asynchronous CRUD operations that the service being a service has less of a chance of getting killedp  pUpdate Part of my confusion is how a handler relates to an activitys lifecycle. From my experiment, it seems that its independent. p  pAlso, for those not familiar with the stock Calendar app source code, the way it works is that to do a CRUD, it adds the operation to a queue along with a reference to a handler. Then it starts the intent service which pops the queue and does the CRUD. When its finished, it invokes the handler via Message.sendToTarget. p  pSo what does that extra complexity buy usp

Of those, 9500 have already been synchronized syncdone is true, will select only rest of the record syncdone is false. Ultimately 9500 records would not come under the select operation.p  pPlease suggest how I might proceed.p

Negative 28511 pThe idea im having is that clients can connect to a chat room on a server and communicate with each other. In the chat room you should also be able to target another user and they should be able to talk with each other. p  pNow to the problem. Im not sure which way is the easiestbest way to implement this. For the chat room I thought of when a user writes something, the message is sent to the server and the server then echoes that message to the other clients. Not sure what other options I have. p  pWhat im most confused about is how I can make only 2 clients talk to each other. Either the server act as a proxy and just forward the messages to the other client, this seem inefficient though.

Negative 28511 pIm coding a spaceinvaders like game, and I want to be able to move the player controlled ship with both mouse and keyboard. There is a speed constant that is being used, when moving the ship with the keyboard. When moving the ship with the mouse, only the position of the ship is changed. When moving the ship with the keyboard, the position of the mouse is also changed, to be consistent with the position of the ship. p  pThe constant I mentioned is not an int value, but a float one. The reason behind this is that I want to add a powerup to increase the speed of the ship, and that may or may not be of type int. Also, I wish to be able to fine tune the speed, if requested by players or by game being to difficult. Problem is, the MouseState gives me a pair of int coordinates, but the position of the ship is a pair of float ones. So herein lies the problem  p  pEach frame, I need to move the ship to the mouse position mouse controlled, and each frame I need to move the mouse position to the ship keyboard controlled. Since the mouse gives me int coordinates, the float ones from the ships position must be converted to int, which destroyes the idea I described earlier. Is there any way I can force the mouse to use float coordinates, either a workaround in XNA or some other API DirectX or WINAPI Im also toying with the idea of virtual coordinates and screen coordinates, with conversion between them. p  pCheers, Alexp  pEDIT  Added code snippet  p  precodeif keybState.IsKeyDownKeys.Right      Mouse.SetPosition     intplayer1.GetPlayerPosition.X  Constants.HorizontalMovementSpeed,      intplayer1.GetPlayerPosition.Y  if keybState.IsKeyDownKeys.Left      Mouse.SetPosition         intplayer1.GetPlayerPosition.X  Constants.HorizontalMovementSpeed,         intplayer1.GetPlayerPosition.Y  if keybState.IsKeyDownKeys.Up      Mouse.SetPosition         intplayer1.GetPlayerPosition.X ,         intplayer1.GetPlayerPosition.Y  Constants.VerticalMovementSpeed  if keybState.IsKeyDownKeys.Down      Mouse.SetPosition         intplayer1.GetPlayerPosition.X,         intplayer1.GetPlayerPosition.Y  Constants.VerticalMovementSpeed  if keybState.IsKeyDownKeys.Space ampamp shootKeyPressed  false      player1.Shoot     shootKeyPressed  true   shoboState  Mouse.GetState player1.MovePlayerShipToPositionnew Vector2shoboState.X, shoboState.Y codepre

Negative 28511 pI run into situations where I need to keep track if Ive processed a particular value. In these cases, I use codeDictionaryOf TKey, TValuecode to keep track of the values that Ive processed. Basically, as each value is processed, I insert the processed value into as key into the dictionary. When I want to see if Ive processed that value, I use the codeContainsKeycode method to see if the value exists in the collection.p  pThis works well, but I do have to insert something in the value side of the keyvalue pair. I would just use a codeListOf Tcode but I want the performance of the hash table lookup that Dictionary provides. Is there a data collection in .Net that is more suitable for this purposep

Negative 28511 pSo I have this situation where i want to serialize models with nonmodel values. I got the serialization of the models [both queryset and single model itself] but trying to combine that with nonmodel values seem problematic. for e.g. I want to JSONify codeUsercode with some codestatuscode of the request. Assume codemodeltoJSONcode does modelJSON, sop  precode it messes the user json by further escaping it,  which becomes unparseble on client since its a string now dumps user modeltoJSONuserobj, status ok codepre  pI could do couple of hacks, by first doing codeloadscode on the converted modeljson. but thats such a hacky way and so much time is just wasted in dumpsloadsdumps second option is string concatenation by doing individuals dumps and then concatenate the strings by stripping  of the leftmost string and  of the rightmost string with ,.p  pThe Django serializers are very specifically written towards modelsqueryset, so I cant really override them.p  pSo has anyone faced this problem before and any solutions you could sharep

I didnt think it was logical to embed claims inside promo collection given the number of writes will happen in a single document coz mongo resizes promo collection when size grows due to thousands of claims. Having non embedded approach keeps promo collection unaffected but insert new document in claims collection. Later while generating report Ill have to display promo details along with claims details for that promo.

It instead just returns a blank page.p  pHeres my funtion.php codep  precodeaddaction init, createposttype  function createposttype      registerposttype eacenglish,         array             labels gt array                 name gt  English ,                 singularname gt  English              ,             supports gt array title, editor, comments, excerpt, customfields, thumbnail ,             taxonomies gt arraycategory,             public gt true,             hasarchive gt true,             rewrite gt arrayslug gt en,               codepre  pAnd then, in a doc labelled archiveeacenglish.php I have the followingp  precodeltphp     thequery  new WPQuery array    posttype gt eacenglish,   orderby gt date,   categoryname gt pastfeaturedartist, name of category by slug   order gt DESC,   postsperpage gt 12  how many posts to show     x  0      while  thequerygthaveposts      thequerygtthepost gt             ltdiv classhomepostboxgt                 lta hrefltphp thepermalink gtgtltphp thepostthumbnailgridimage gtltagt                 lta hrefltphp thepermalink gt classhomeposttextgtlth3gtltphp thetitle gtlth3gtltagt             ltdivgtlthomepostboxgt        ltphp x gt     ltphp endwhile gt      ltphp wpresetquery gt codepre  pI have an  eacenglish post with with the category defined as pastfeatuerdartist, but when I visit that page urlcategorypastfeaturedartist nothing is returned. p  pNow if I take all the code in archiveeacenglish.php and add it to archive.php it works no problem, but obviously that doesnt give me the option to only call the post organized under eacenglish.p  pAny help here would be greatly appreciated cheers,p

Negative 28511 pI have been bashing my head against a wall for several hours now and I suspect that the answer is a simple one if you know where to look.p  pI have a compiled stored procedure in MS SQL 2005 which works perfectly. I have tested it and have no errors whatsoever.p  pHowever when I call the same procedure from my PHP include file shown here the stored procedure seems to start running my mssql trace shows the call to be made correctly then stops half way through. Sometimes I get 10 out of 15 records updated. Other times I get 5 out of 14.p  pIf I copy the command that was run from the trace window and run it directly in MS SQL management studio it works perfectly. This leads me to think it is some sort of timeout or am I closing the connection before the procedure is run so MS SQL 2005 thinks it should be terminatedp  precodeltphp sessionstart require ..includesconfig.inc.php  require..includesmssql.php  function includebookingbox, offeredtolocumid, surgery, rate      dbc2  mssqlconnectDBHOST, DBUSER, DBPASSWORD     q2  exec WEBSurgeryBoxOfferBoxtoLocum .box., .offeredtolocumid., .surgery.     myresult  mssqlqueryq2 ,dbc2             set out document type to textjavascript instead of texthtml      headerContenttype textjavascript      offeredtolocumid  GET[locumid]     rate  GET[rate]     rate  15.99     surgery  SESSION[surgeryid]     box  SESSION[currentbox]      includebookingbox, offeredtolocumid, surgery, rate      gt codepre  pI am new to the PHP  MS SQL bit so I understand that the code above is not perfect by any means.p  pI have many other procedure calls that work without problem.

My main program, pipe.c, includes the parentchild process with a while loop that should continue getting an input from the user with fgets, create a child process, use dup2, write to stdout, then the child process invoke the receive.c executable which will get the input from stdin and display it.. p  precode file pipe.c  include ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltstring.hgt include ltunistd.hgt include ltsystypes.hgt include ltsyswait.hgt  int main    int keyloggeron  0   int p[2]   pidt pid   char str[256]   char input[1024]   int status   char  file  test.txt    printfInput     whilefgetsinput, sizeofinput, stdin       if pipep1        perrorPipe create error       exit1           if pidfork1        perrorFork create error       exit1           if pid0        closep[1]   Close write       dup2p[0],0       closep[0]       execlpreceive,file,NULL          else        closep[0]   Close read       fflushstdout       dup2p[1],1       closep[1]       write1, input, strleninput1       waitpidpid, NULL, 0          printfInput       codepre  pHere is the simple receive.c that gets the stdin of the input and displays it. The file is just a test of passing a parameter.p  precode file receive.c  include ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltstring.hgt include ltunistd.hgt  int mainint argc, char argv[]    char input[256]   fgetsinput, sizeofinput, stdin   printfFILE s  RECEIVE s, argv[0],input   return 0  codepre  pRight now, all this does for me is when ran the first time, it gets the input, sends it to stdout, child calls receive, prints out the input, and then the whole parent program exits, the while loop is ignored, everything just ends. Im very new to forks and pipes so this is very frustrating to deal with Even made me post a question on here for the first time Thank you very much in advance. p

Negative 28511 pHi Ive been thinking for some time that codeSubjectltTgtcode disposes all the subscriptions based on it if you manually call its codeDisposecode method. But Ive recently found it doesnt work that way, it just clears its inner collection of observers and substitutes it with a DisposedObserver helper class instance.p  pI found myself a little confused about the behaviour, just assumed that the normal would be just propagate and dispose all the suscribers. Later, trying to figure out why is designed this way, I guessed a couple of reasons why they designed this way.p  ul liThe suscriber may be a composition that depents partially on the subject , so full propagation of disposal doesnt make sense.  ie. Merge is not disposed just because one of the sources was disposed, as everyone expects.li licodeSubject.Disposecode It is semantically equivalent to a continuation with codeObservable.Nevercode from the side of the observer. The Subject.Dispose caller can also call OnComplete or OnError if wanted to signal error or completion before disposal because they are on the same scope.li ul  pEdit Note Sorry for the unclear question. I already understand how to use it, this was more a design question. Let me state it more clearly. p  pWhy do you think the designers of Rx made Dispose behaviour that wayp  pthe two points above are my answer trial  p

Negative 28511 pI guess I am not understanding something very critical here. The following code is trying to compute the convolution of two signals using the FFT method. The problem I am having is that sometimes I get a wrongweird output. When I try and explicitly run each step of my convolution function at line 104 in main, it works. Now, if I run the code normally, via the convolution function, it works After I get the output I expect, I cannot recreate the setting that gets me the wrong answer. I am at a loss as to how this could happen.p  pEDIT  Code block contains data.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltmath.hgt  include ltcudaruntime.hgt include ltcufft.hgt include ltcuda.hgt  typedef enum signaltype REAL, COMPLEX signal  typedef float2 Complex  void printDataComplex a, int size, char msg     if msg   printfn   else printfsn, msg    for int i  0 i lt size i     printff fn, a[i].x, a[i].y   void normDataComplex a, int size, float norm     for int i  0 i lt size i      a[i].x  norm     a[i].y  norm       flag  1 for real signals. void randomFillComplex hsignal, int size, int flag      Real signal.   if flag  REAL      for int i  0 i lt size i        hsignal[i].x  rand  float RANDMAX       hsignal[i].y  0            FFT a signal thats on the DEVICE. void signalFFTComplex dsignal, int signalsize      Handle type used to store and execute CUFFT plans.

Negative 28511 pBefore you start asking why in the world I want to do this, bear in mind I dont have much experience with Windows.Forms and at this point I am just experimenting.p  pLets say I form with 5 buttons. And like every button, it should do something once I press it. I found out I could add multiple methods to an event such as thisp  precodebutton1.Click  DoThis button1.Click  ButAlsoThis codepre  pI did this for every button. Then I tried to make a method that removes all methods for a given button. Something like thisp  precodepublic void RemoveHandlersButton btn      Code to remove handlers  codepre  pThats where I got stuck...p  pI was hoping C would accept something like thisp  precodebtn.Click  null codepre  pBut appearantly Events only accept  and .p  pSo now I have this elaborate system where I have buttons and an list of EventHandlers, linked with a dictionairy. Then I remove each Eventhandler individually. It works... But I think there should be an easier way.p  pSo long story short p  pstrongIs there an easy method to remove all handlers from an Event without prior knowledge of the handlers involvedstrongp  pEdit, I found the answer thanks to Carlos Landerasp  precodeprivate void RemoveClickEventButton b      FieldInfo f1  typeofControl.GetFieldEventClick,      BindingFlags.Static  BindingFlags.NonPublic     object obj  f1.GetValueb     PropertyInfo pi  b.GetType.GetPropertyEvents,       BindingFlags.NonPublic  BindingFlags.Instance     EventHandlerList list  EventHandlerListpi.GetValueb, null     list.RemoveHandlerobj, list[obj]  codepre  pBut I just dont want to copypaste, Id like to know what is happening here.p
Negative 28511 pI am using qt designer and python.  I want to make a layout where a user can drag widgets to control the size while at the same time scaling properly with the window.  Basically all 3d modeling programs have this function, usually it has a top left right and perspective view.  The user can drag the edges to resize each view and it will maintain that aspect ratio when the main window is resized.  My question is similar to this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8233263activeresizingofwidgetsinsidemainwindowactive resizing of widgets inside mainwindowa  but I would like to do it in qt designer.  p  pSo what I have found is the layout horizontalvertical splitter.  However I am only able to layout two widgets horizontally, and another two widgets horizontally, then grid layout.  This makes it look similar to what I want except I want the top and bottom horizontal layouts to also be resize able.  p  pThanksp  pEdit p  pI have been able to do this with putting both horizontal split views in a group box and then splitting the two group boxes, however that makes each widget independent and does not let the user grab the middle axis to control all 4 views.p

Of course, each row has properties in the codeReviewcode object.  One property is a pram called codewasRatedcode which is either code0code or code1code if this param is 1, it means the user rated the item, the list row is made bold to reflect this.

Negative 28511 pSo, I have the rather popular problem of updating the SQL data in my core data powered app upon the release of a new version of the app. p  pemQuick summary of the apps mechanicsem p  pI have a console app that uses the same xcdatamodeld file as my app, in which I prefill the SQL database sqlite file. I then use this file in my app for the sake of prefilled data.p  pstrongThe Problem isstrong, every time I run such an updateusually monthly, the documents folder is preserved and the app ignores the new data and displays blank pages where the new data should be. This is obviously solved by deleting amp reinstalling the app but thats too much of a hassle for my users who would need new content monthly.p  h1emWhat Ive tried so faremh1  pI was advised to look through the core data migration docs and utilise data model versioning. This didnt work for me because my issue is with the actual data not the model. The model remains the same, its just the data it feeds off that changes. p  ul liI tried loading a JSON file from a webservice on a daily basis to avoid the need to ever update the app itself, but I got complaints from my clients, stating that one of the main features the users wanted was offline access. Especially for those in countries where mobile internet access is rather expensive and unreliable. li ul  pThe above reason ruled out other solutions such as stackmob etc. p  pAfter reading and much thinking, I feel this might work p  pWrite code to check for an existing database during app launch. If the existing DB is different from the new oneI plan to use some sort of numeric dependent condition e.g if version no1 lt new version, then it will delete the existing DB and use the new DB from the update. Without requiring the user to delete and reinstall the app every time an update is released.p  pAt this stage, I am open to any other ideas that will allow me prepopulate the database and update it monthly without any worries. I dont mind rewriting the app from scratch.p  pAny help is welcome. [emDont let my mastery of markdown fool you, Im a beginner em ]p

Negative 28511 pThis is just a curiosity that bugs me. I created a Form class to handle document selection from a database.

Negative 28511 pI am trying to draw parallels between ObjectiveC Category and features in Java and Ruby. Please see if these conclusions are accurate  p  pObjectiveC Category adds new methods to an existing class even when you do not have access to source code of the class. Java does not have anything similar but in Ruby you can open any class, including core language class like String. p  precodeclass String    def mynewmethod   new test method  end end  some string.mynewmethod gt new test method codepre  pSimilarly in ObjectiveC  you can reopen the NSString class using category. p  precodeimport NSStringForTest.h  implementation NSString ForTest  NSString myNewMethod    return new test method   end codepre  pHowever, one difference I see is that, in Ruby, once a class is opened and modified within a runtime, ALL subsequent uses of that class are affected, in other words it is a system wide change, while in ObjectiveC only code that imports this header file and any subclasses are affected.  Are there any other differences p

Negative 28511 pIm currently working on a game I started a while ago. Progress was good and everything runs smoothly, but I decided to try using XCode Instruments to check for any leaks in my code. I am using ARC and new objects are only added when others are deleted part of my games innerworkings, but the total memory size keeps growing as it runs.p  pMy game is completely procedurally generated and requires no assets, it also only uses a couple polygons mapped only with colors, so there are no textures. I expect it should only need a couple MBs to run which it starts out with but it just keeps growing.p  pNow, I noticed something interesting... What uses up the majority of the data is an entry called IOAccelResource. Which is odd because I dont use any accelerometergyroscopecompass data. I dont even have the CoreMotion framework referenced in my project.p  pThe second major use of data is a collection of four mallocs that keep growing. There are a couple more that stay relatively the same.p  pThese two entries arent considered leaks by the program though. And when I tell XCode to analyze my code it doesnt point to any problems.p  pAll of the other entries are pretty small and fluctuate around the same point, or just stay the same.p  pHere is a screenshot of the troublesome entries img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzhuca.png altEntriesp  pAny advicep

Negative 28511 pI saw a similar, but still different question to this, so just to clarify this is not a dupe of 13428881 Calling a function in an injected DLL. p  pWhat I have at the minute A DLL, injected into a target process, displaying a message box and fiddling around doing math.p  pWhat I want in the future A DLL which can manipulate and toy with the internals of the target process.p  pThe next step towards achieving the desired manipulation is to call a method in a remote thread within the process Im injecting into.p  pLets take an example I have a C application, which has int main, lets say it looks like thisp  precodeint PrintTextstring text      cout ltlt text     return 1   int main      while true              PrintTextFrom the DLL       codepre  pOk, so thats lovely, my target application is currently printing some text, and it seems to be doing so very happily. Its spamming it at an unbelievable rate, but I can slow it down using threads and sleeps etc if I need to. The fact is this isnt an issue, the code here hasnt been compiled or tested, and Ive no intention of using this exact code. Im actually working with a game.p  pNow, lets say I create a pointer to the method, PrintText, and that I know the address of it within that process. How do I go about calling it, externally, passing in argumentsp  pLocally, I believe it would look something like thisp  precodeint i int PrintSomeTextstring  PrintText codepre  pI could then call this function using a reference, like sop  precodei  operationText to be printed, PrintSomeText codepre  pThis should, by my theory, declare an integer called i, then define a pointer to a method which returns int, takes one string as a parameter, and the pointer stores the value of the pointer which was in PrintText. Or something of that nature.p  pVery nice, so I can call my own functions via pointer, thats great, cracking in fact. Ive truly astonished myself with this ability, and I do now feel like superman. Ill go save some babies or something, brb.p  pBack, so now I want to continue a little further, and take that next step. Lets say I know that the the method is at the address 100 in the target process decimal, I will likely do it in hexadecimal, as Im using CheatEngine  OllyDBG to find methods in the target process, but for this example well stay simple.p  pI presume that my injected DLL gets its own space entirely, does it have any higher access to the target process How can I find this outp  pThanks for your time, Joshp  pEdit A small note, Im going through the C tutorial book, and its proven so far to be very useful. Ive noticed that I forgot to include my operation method, so apologies for that being missing. If its required, let me know. Thanksp  pEdit nr 2 Ive just made some compilable code to test this out, since I wrote most of this free hand reading from the book without an IDE, and the IDE has finally configured itself, so here is the code Im currently working withp  precodeinclude stdafx.h include ltiostreamgt  using namespace std  int PrintTextchar  Text      cout ltlt Text ltlt endl     return 1   int tmainint argc, TCHAR argv[]      int Printchar  PrintText     char Text[]  Hello, world     PrintTextText     int x  PrintOh my word, it really works     cin.get     return 0  codepre  pNote I havent yet made it run indefinitely, so yeah, please excuse that, Ill add it shortly.p

I call commit  blockUntilFinshed  shutdown before exiting.p  pWhen I query the SOLR server  only 200 documents seems to get the update.p  pI tried this also with only 1 thread my thread  still 48 on the update server and still the same problem.p  pWhen I change from concurrentUpdateSolrServer to HttpSolrServer 1 thread it works fine.p

Negative 28511 pI am wondering if there is a way to have a python variable to behave like a python module.p  pProblem I currently have is that we have python bindings for our API. The bindings are automatically generated through swig and to use them someone would only needs top  precodeimport modulename as shortname  shortname.functions codepre  pRight now we are studying having the API to use Apache Thrift. To use it someone needs top  precodeclient, transport  thriftconnect  client.functions ...      transport.close codepre  pProblem is that we have loads of scripts and we were wondering if there is a way to have the thrift client object to behave like a module so that we dont need to modify all scripts. One idea we had was to do something like thisp  precodeclient, transport  thriftconnect  global shortname shortname  client builtins.shortname  client codepre  pThis sort of works. It creates a global variable shortname that acts like a module, but it also generates other problems. If other files import the same module it is needed to comment those imports. Also, having a global variable is not a bright idea for maintenance purposes.p  pSo, would there be a way to make the thrift client to behave like a module So that people could continue to use the old syntax, but under the hood the module import would trigger a connection ans return the object as the modulep  pEDIT 1p  pIt is fine for every import to open a connection. Maybe we could use some kind of singleton so that a specific interpreter can only open one connection even if it calls multiple imports on different files.p  pI thought about binding the transport.close to a object termination. Could be the module itself, if that is possible.p  pEDIT 2p  pThis seems to do what I wantp  precodeclient, transport  thriftconnect attributes  dictname, getattrclient, name  for name in dirclient  if not name.startswith or name.startswith globals.updateattributes codepre

I would like to remove or improve the offending code through one of three waysp  ol liImplementing a custom thrust memory allocatorli liReplacing the thrust code with CUB code with preallocated temp storageli liWrite a custom kernel to do what I wantli ol  pAlthough the third option would be my normal preferred choice, the operation that I want to perform is a codecopyifcodecodeselectifcode type operation where both the data and indexes are returned. Writing a custom kernel would likely be reinventing the wheel and so I would prefer to go with one of the other two options.p  pI have been hearing great things about CUB, and so I see this as an ideal chance to use it in anger. What I would like to know isp  pHow would one implement a CUB codeselectifcode with returned indexesp  pCan this be done with an codeArgIndexInputIteratorcode and a functor like sop  precodestruct GreaterThan      int compare      host device forceinline     GreaterThanint compare  comparecompare       host device forceinline     bool operatorconst cubArgIndexInputIteratorltintgt ampa const          return a.value gt compare       codepre  pwith the following in the main body of the codep  precodedin  device int array dtempstorage  some preallocated block   int thresholdvalue GreaterThan selectopthresholdvalue  cubArgIndexInputIteratorltintgt inputitrdin cubArgIndexInputIteratorltintgt outputitrdout    CubDebugExitDeviceSelectIfdtempstorage, tempstoragebytes, inputitr, outputitr, dnumselected, numitems, selectop codepre  pWill this try and do any memory allocation under the hoodp  pstrongEDITstrongp  pSo going off Robert Crovellas comment, the functor should take the product of dereferencing a codecubArgIndexInputIteratorltintgtcode, which should be a codecubItemOffsetPairltintgtcode making the functor nowp  precodestruct GreaterThan      int compare      host device forceinline     GreaterThanint compare  comparecompare       host device forceinline     bool operatorconst cubItemOffsetPairltint,intgt ampa const          return a.value gt compare       codepre  pand in the code, codedoutcode should be a device array of codecubItemOffsetPairltint,intgtcodep  precodedin  device int array dtempstorage  some preallocated block  cubItemOffsetPairltint,intgt  dout allocate dout  int thresholdvalue GreaterThan selectopthresholdvalue  cubArgIndexInputIteratorltint,intgt inputitrdin CubDebugExitDeviceSelectIfdtempstorage, tempstoragebytes, inputitr, dout, dnumselected, numitems, selectop codepre

Negative 28511 pim using jQuery to vertically center different elements on a page. I wont be able to use the tablecell cssstatement, because its not supported in lower versions of IE, so im using jQuery to calculte half of the height and then set it in the middle via negative margin.p  pThis works fine if i just use the adressbar to refresh the page, but if im using the reloadbutton it will calculate the wrong height and set it way too low. For example, the height of the broken element is 863px but jQuery sets margintop 228.5pxp  pThanks in advance. p  precodefunction verticalCenterobject      objectHeight  object.height  2     object.csspositionrelative,top50,marginTopobjectHeight       document .readyfunction      verticalCenterpromoheading     verticalCentercenter1     verticalCentercenter2  codepre

Negative 28511 pOkay, so I have a script processing the nullseparated output of codefindcode, and I can easily process this using a bash shell like sop  precodebinsh find 1 print0  while read rd  path do echo path done codepre  pFairly silly example since it just converts the results to newlines anyway, but its just to give you an idea of what Im looking to do. This basic method works great, and avoids potential issues due to files possibly containing newlines on various filesystems.p  pHowever, I need to do the same thing on a nonbash shell, which means I lose support for coderead dcode. So, without resorting to bash or other shell specific features, is there a way that I can process nullseparated results similarly to the abovep  pIf not, what is the best to protect myself against newlines in results I was thinking I could perhaps use the codeexeccode option of codefindcode to replace newlines in file names with some kind of escaped value, but Im not sure of the best way to find and replace the newlines I cant use codetrcode for example or what replacement to use, which is why nullcharacters are the best option if available.p

Negative 28511 pI am in need of your help I am trying to make this program work to solve the puzzle in the comment block p  pheres the program and where I am stuck at. I got most of it i would say but im stuck in couple functions. especially the main function, I do not know what to do with it p  precode Purpose This program solves the following puzzle outlined in           the following steps            1. Start with a long hallway full of lights that are               each controlled by respective toggle switches.           2. All lights are initially off.           3. Start at the first light and run to the end of the               hallway toggling every light.           4. Start at the second light and run to the end of the              hallway toggling every second light.           5. Start at the third light and run to the end of the              hallway toggling every third light.              .              .              .           6. Toggle the last light.            7. Which lights are on, and which lights are off You               might be able to spot a mathematical pattern            We will use a Light class and a Hallway class to model           the solution to this puzzle. The latter will contain an           array of the former.   Input   The number of lights in the hallway as an integer read           in from the standard input stream. BE CAREFUL The           bigger the number you enter i.e., the longer the           hallway, the slower your program will run why.    Output  The status of all of the lights in a hallway on or off.   include ltiostreamgt  using namespace std  const int MAXLIGHTS  1000  void TurnOff    A simple class to model the behavior of a light bulb with a toggle  switch.  class Light  private    bool isOn  public          Default constructor.

The User can be either buyer or seller of the Order.p  pBecause both buyer and seller can enter additional information for an order, I moved that to an extra entity codeOrderUserDatacode. There might or might not be a corresponding codeOrderUserDatacode object, but IF one exists, the user should only be able to see the entry they created based on USERID and not the one of the other party.p  pThe entities look like thisp  precodeEntity Tablename  TORDER public class Order       Id     GeneratedValuestrategy  GenerationType.IDENTITY     private Long id      ManyToOne     JoinColumnname  SELLERID     private User seller      ManyToOne     JoinColumnname  BUYERID     private User buyer      OneToManymappedBy  order, fetch  FetchType.EAGER     private ListltOrderUserDatagt userData  new ArrayListltgt     ..  codepre  pp  precodeEntity Tablename  TORDERUSERDATA public class OrderUserData       Id     GeneratedValuestrategy  GenerationType.IDENTITY     private Long id      ManyToOne     JoinColumnname  ORDERID     private Order order      ManyToOne     JoinColumnname  USERID     private User user      private String comment   ...  codepre  p codeUsercode is not very exciting, just ID and basic name fields p  pNow when Im trying to select the appropriate data to display in the website, I have a problemp  precodeString qry  SELECT o FROM Order o LEFT JOIN o.userData ud                WHERE o.seller.id  userId OR o.buyer.id  userId               AND  ud.user IS NULL OR ud.user.id  userId      TypedQueryltOrdergt query  em.createQueryqry, Order.class      query.setParameteruserId, userId codepre  pLets say I execute this, setting codeuserIdcode to 2p  pMy Database looks like thisp  precodeORDER  ID    SELLERID    BUYERID 1     1            2 2     2            3 3     3            1  ORDERUSERDATA  ID     ORDERID    USERID    COMMENT 1      1           1          Comment that only user 1 should see 2      1           2          Comment that only user 2 should see codepre  pBut unlike you would expect, when executing the above query, both records are included in the codeuserDatacode list It seems like JPA is executing two queries despite the EAGER fetch and ignoring the WHERE on the second one.

Negative 28511 pI have an excel workbook which has 5 worksheets. The back 4 worksheets are filled from queries in Access with values for a summary. The front worksheet is formated all nicely and has graphs and such. The values in the tables on the front sheet are pulled from the back sheets by setting the cell formulas to something like thisp  precode BackSheet1A1 codepre  pThis works great but now I need to keep the values in the cell and break the connection so I can delete the back 4 worksheets because thats what the boss wants. p  pSo my question is about the execution of this.

Is there a better way Can I call an excel chunk of VBA from Access VBA so this happens upon creation of the file Any other thoughts or tips are appreciated.p  pThanks.p

Negative 28511 pThis question relates to gcc 4.6.3 Ubuntu and its behavior in unrolling loops for SSE intrinsics with immediate operands.p  pAn example of an intrinsic with immediate operand is mmblendps. It expects a 4bit immediate integer which can only be a constant. However, using the O3 option, the compiler apparently automatically unrolls loops if the loop counter values can be determined at compile time and produces multiple instances of the corresponding blend instruction with different immediate values.p  pThis is a simple test code blendsimple.c which runs through the 16 possible values of the immediate operand of blendp  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltx86intrin.hgt  define PRINTV                   printfs , V                  for i  3 i gt 0 i printf3g , V[i]       printfn  int main    m128 a  mmsetps1, 2, 3, 4   m128 b  mmsetps5, 6, 7, 8   int i   PRINTa   PRINTb   unsigned mask   m128 r   for mask  0 mask lt 16 mask      r  mmblendpsa, b, mask     PRINTr      return 0  codepre  pIt is possible compile this code withp  precodegcc Wall marchnative O3 o blendsimple blendsimple.c codepre  pand the code works. Obviously the compiler unrolls the loop and inserts constants for the immediate operand.p  pHowever, if you compile the code withp  precodegcc Wall marchnative O2 o blendsimple blendsimple.c codepre  pyou get the following error for the blend intrinsicp  precodeerror the last argument must be a 4bit immediate codepre  pNow I tried to find out which specific compiler flag is active in O3 but not in O2 which allows the compiler to unroll the loop, but failed. Following the gcc online docs atp  pa hrefhttpsgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocsgcc4.8.2gccOverallOptions.html relnofollowhttpsgcc.gnu.orgonlinedocsgcc4.8.2gccOverallOptions.htmlap  pI executed the following commandsp  precodegcc c Q O3 helpoptimizers gt tmpO3opts gcc c Q O2 helpoptimizers gt tmpO2opts diff tmpO2opts tmpO3opts  grep enabled codepre  pwhich lists all options enabled by O3 but not by O2. When I add all of the 7 listed flags in addition to O2p  precodegcc Wall marchnative O2 fgcseafterreload finlinefunctions fipacpclone fpredictivecommoning ftreeloopdistributepatterns ftreevectorize funswitchloops blendsimple blendsimple.c codepre  pI would expect that the behavior is exactly the same as with O3. However, the compiler complains that the last argument must be a 4bit immediate.p  pDoes anyone have an idea what the problem is I think it would be good to know which flag is required to enable this type of loop unrolling so that it can be activated selectively using pragma GCC optimize or by a function attribute.p  pI was also surprised that O3 obviously doesnt even enable the unrollloops option.p  pI would be grateful for any help. This is for a lecture on SSE programming I give.p  pEdit Thanks a lot for your comments. jtaylor seems to be right. I got my hand on two newer versions of gcc 4.7.3, 4.8.2, and 4.8.2 complains on the immediate problem regardless of the optimization level. Moverover, I later noticed that gcc 4.6.3 compiles the code with O2 funrollloops, but this also fails in 4.8.2. So apparently one cannot trust this feature and should always unroll manually using cpp or templates, as Jason R pointed out.p

Negative 28511 pWe have a 50GB onpremises TFS collection, which we want to have migrated to TFS online. We are now using the OpsHub Visual Studio Online Migration Utility, to test with. The conversion of some separate test projects seem to work fine, so now we are trying to measure the time it will take for a full migration. It looks like the migration of all 78K changesets will take about a month. That is way too long for us. The tool is using only one Core of our 8 available Cores. I dont see other resource bottlenecks, other than the CPU the Core in use is over 50 most of the time. Are there any tips for a faster migration Is there any way to speed up things Besides asking you all for a possible solution, I am now also trying to do several smaller migrations in parallel. As soon as I have results of that, I will share them.p
Negative 28511 pIm not sure if this is possible but Im looking for a solution that would give a similar effect. I have a calendar control on an asp.net C page along with a button.p  pHere is some background as to how the page works When the user selects a date range, there is a post back that shows data and also populates a few drop down boxes with data relevant to the selected date ranges. The dropdown boxes are used to filter the data, for example, the user could choose a specific customer to view data for. After the user selects filters from the drop down boxes, they would click the button to update the page with the filtered data. Alternatively, if they did not select a date and the button is clicked, the selected date range is assumed to be this week. The button is needed because we would prefer not to do multiple database calls if the user wants to use more than one filter from the dropdowns.p  pWith that said, I want to be able to prevent each of these controls from calling another post back if there is already one in progress for the other control. Ive seen disabling a button by doing thisp  precode                ltaspButton ID  ShowDataButton runatserver                   OnClientClickthis.disabled  true                 UseSubmitBehavior  false                 onclickShowDataButtonClick                 Text  Show Datagt codepre  pIs there a similar property for a Calendar control that would allow me to disable the button control Something like, codeOnClientSelectionChanged  ShowDataButton.disabled  truecode From what Ive researched so far, Im not too hopeful that this exists. If it doesnt, is there another way that I could accomplish something similar When I try to add codeShowDataButton.Enabled  falsecode to the codeOnSelectionChangedcode event method in the code behind, the button doesnt get disabled until after the postback is finished, which I should have expected. Without something like this occurring, the calendar control ends up returning codeDateTime.MinValuecode if the user selects a date and then immediately clicks the button as the post back takes a few seconds to complete. Any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.p

Negative 28511 pSo I have a numeric up down control in place, and I want to make the updown increment and decrement buttons hidden. So far I have set it up within the value changed event for testing purposes. Basically once the value becomes greater than 3 the buttons are supposed to become hidden. The code looks something like thisp  precode    private void numericUpDown1ValueChangedobject sender, EventArgs e              if numericUpDown1.Value gt 3                      numericUpDown1.Controls[0].Visible  false             numericUpDown1.Controls[0].Hide             numericUpDown1.Refresh               codepre  pIt works... Sort of. You see the buttons become disabled, as in I cannot click them any more but they are still clearly visible. It looks something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com67imi.png altIgnore the Textboxp  pThe textbox is just part of another test where basically you take the value of the numericupdown control and subtract it from 10, the answer goes in the textbox.p  pAs you can see I have tried setting the visible property in the past and have even tried to force the entire control to redraw itself, but nothing seems to be working at this point. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much in advance.p
Negative 28511 p Sorry for this wordy post, but I wanted to describe as much as I could about my situation p  pIve been trying to get a 1  0..1 relationship modeled in Hibernate and I cant get it to work, even though Ive tried all combinations of options  cascade, unique, constrained, etc. Ive read through other posts like a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions841354hibernateonetozerooronemappingHibernate one to zero or one mappinga and a hrefhttpsforum.hibernate.orgviewtopic.phpt949458 relnofollowhttpsforum.hibernate.orgviewtopic.phpt949458a but they are about querying the data and Im having trouble with insertupdates.

Otherwise there is no someData object nor data row.p  p3 Sometimes type  a is known during creation sometimes type is set to a after the initial Person insert, in which case a new data row must be inserted. Type may also be changed to b, in which case the data row should be removed but I really dont care if it hangs around.p  pI dont think this should be so complicated, but somehow it is. What I found is p  p1 When my form is submitted, struts2 builds a new Person and attaches a new someData object to it no matter what, since struts2 doesnt know about the typea rule. Q  Can I make struts2 build it conditionally Also, how does Hibernate persistence work when struts2 builds new objects every time Doesnt that totally defeat the persistence of an object in memory being linked to a DB row Anyway, because of this, I cant have Hibernate create a data row based on the someData object existing. So MY code checks if type  a and if so, calls saveOrUpdate with the someData object.p  p2 I have to set the backward pointing link from someDataPerson. Why I dont use this link in my code  is there a way to configure this scenario without the backwards someDataPerson pointerp  p3 The real problem I have is with the ID of someData, and whether or not my code needs to set it.p  p If Person exists and the user changes type to a, someData now has to be created in the DB. If I set the Id attribute of someData, Hibernate tries to Update the row, and returns an error saying since the row in data table doesnt exist. If I DONT set the Id attribute of someData, it will be inserted correctly with the Person ID.p  p OK, so my code wont set the Id attribute of someData. But then, if someData already existed in the DB so this operation is an update, Hibernate returns an error saying Duplicate row since without the Id set in the object, it tries to insert the row with the Person Id. So I cant set the Id, and I cant NOT set the Id. p  pHow can I configure Hibernate or change my code to have this work correctlyp

Negative 28511 pIm creating a program that simulates that of the Breakout Game using C.p  pIve been learning various techniques on how to create the bricks, paddle and ball for the game but cannot work out on how to add them all into one picture box in Visual Studio. p  pThe main issue Im facing is that in order to move the ball for example, I have to clear the canvas by using the following section of code codepaper.ClearColor.Whitecode This basically clears the picture box to the colour white in order for the new coordinate of the ball for example to be dawn within the picture box and this is where my issue begins.p  pEach of the components within the Breakout game that I have practised all use the codepaper.ClearColor.Whitecode code. This means that if for example I want to move the paddle, display the bricks and bounce the ball simultaneously, the program just decides to do one function at a time. If I remove codepaper.ClearColor.Whitecode from one of my assets then the program just wont function in the way I want it to. p  pIs there a way for all these components to run simultaneously within the game without missing any of them out completely  p

Negative 28511 pLets say I have a branch called codedevcode which is going to be updated. I do a codegit checkout newbranchcode where I am going to add new files and not bother with the code that was or is going to be written in codedevcode. Lets say dev has a folder codeprojectcode with some scripts, and in codenewbranchcode I will create codeprojectextascode which Ill merge to codedevcode. The problem is that the codeproject foldercode from the codedevcode branch is now also showing in my codenewbranchcode. When I am finally merging codenewbanchcode with codedevcode I will have mergeconflicts with whatever new code was added to codeprojectcode in dev and I want to avoid that completely. But now codeprojectcode has somehow been committed and pushed in codenewbranchcode how do I undo or remove this I try to avoid merge conflicts as much as possible as Im very scared of them and usually cant resolve them easily, so I need the merge to be clean.p

Negative 28511 pI want to manipulate a treebased data structure with several threads and protect each node with a mutex.  The target architecture has several hundred threads and operates on virtual shared memory.p  pIf CPU 1 acquires a lock on a node it is to manipulate, will this change of state mutex be communicated to all other cores actively or only if requestedp  pI would assume that like all other changes of shared variables, mutex changes are written to main memory. Caches of other CPUs are invalidated and replaced based on their policy. The value of the mutex is only accessed by another CPU if it wants to lock it or if their cache replacement policy loads it from memory.p  pIs this correct, or are mutexes treated differently and broadcast immediately or withheld until requested Id like to avoid invalidating hundreds of caches each time a node is locked. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6868007onmulticorex86systemsaremutexesimplementedusingalockdinstructionThis questiona indicates that the bus is locked each time a mutex is used, which does not seem to be a problem.p  pstrongEditstrongp  pIm asking about the C11 mutexes as implemented by GCC 4.8. As far as I know, the Intel Compiler also uses the GCC libraries for anything to do with the C11 specification. Im worried about overhead more than about correctness.p

Negative 28511 pIm having this problem where a view is not being run through the layout on the server, but in a local instance it works just fine without any changes.

When querying using DIR, or in Windows Explorer, the files involved have the same date as they had, before being handled by the ZIPUNZIP process.p  pSo, all OK. p  pBut then, Im using the codeXCOPY Dcode command, to further manipulate different copies of those files on the disk ... and, XCOPY says  one file is newer than the other one.

How do I prevent that strongp  pFrom how I see, theres different things involved, being XCOPY, very specific ZIP and UNZIP, and NTFS file system. Which one is doing something wrong p  pI must stress that apart from ZIP and UNZIP, there are strongnostrong other changes done to the file, like changing 1 file, then making a change to another one, in less than 60 seconds time.p  pAt moment of test, the time shown was NOT the current time, and not close to it either. No file is adjusting to the current time, the times refer to last changes of the file in question, which may be any time in the past. In this case, its one day later, but it can be anything.p

Currently my config file has the following codep  pauth sufficient pamtest.sobr auth required pamgoogleauthenticator.sopli ol  pThe googleauthenticator module is invoked correctly if my module fails to authenticate when the password entered is correct but the typing behavior does not match.

Negative 28511 pThere seem to be many examples of using two MOC to handle concurrent data, but my usecase is a bit simpler. Parts of my object graph should be affected by undo, and parts of it should not. For example in a word processor, the user can undo an action like adding an object to a document, but if they rename the document, it should not undo the rename. Is using two MOCs appropriate for solving this problem one with an undo manager where undoable changes are made, and one without My biggest concern is managing connections between objects in the two MOCs and if it would be wiser to forgo a formal CoreData relationship and manually manage them using NSManagedObjectIDs.p

Negative 28511 pI have gone through most of the links here on stackoverflow and i have some doubts regarding InApp Subscriptions and Google Wallet.p  pWhat i knowp  ol liInApp Subscriptions basically allows a user to be able to subscribe to an app, say for example if it offers one year trial period, then once thats over, Google automatically handles the subscriptions then after.li liGoogle Wallet, its a method that can be used to perform the purchase. strongWhat i dont understand is, can i use this method in order to allow users to use the app for one year, and then make them pay for the next yearsstrongli ol  blockquote   pBilling continues indefinitely at the interval and price specified for the subscription. At each subscription renewal, Google Play charges the user account automatically, then notifies the user of the charges afterward by email. For monthly and annual subscriptions, billing cycles will always match subscription cycles, based on the purchase date. Seasonal subscriptions are charged annually, on the first day of the season.p blockquote  pThis is what happens in my app  1. A user logs in, and i get a date that probably keeps track of the billing cycle  2. If the sessions expired, the user is asked to pay using the inApp Billing serivce  3. Based on TrivailDriveApp Example, where we have the success log printed on subscription, we update the date of payment.p  pSome questions i havep  ol lipAs per the quote from android, if the user is automatically subscribed to the service, and if a mail is sent to the user, does that mean that i would never be able to get a notification about the payment extension How do i sync that with the server thenpli lipIs my approach wrong in handling this kind of scenario Or do i have to select a different method of handling app extensionspli ol  pP.S There is no way of testing inapp subscriptions also. I wonder if i could do that without using real creditdebit card credentials.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pI would also want to keep track of when the purchase or billing was done, if subscriptions are autorenewed, then should i take up the purchase flow as an InApp Product instead of an InApp Subscriptionp  pPlease help.p

Local socket timeout was 000959.8593729.strongp  pWhen I debug the WCF Service, it is actually not taking long at all. It immediately returns a result. it only validates the log in information by querying the database and return it immediately. So, my guess is not related to timeout at all.. but I dont know how to resolve it..p  pPlease help... p

Negative 28511 pI have a codeMainFrameJFramecode. From within it I call codeJavaFX dialogcode. How to make it modal and always on top of JFrame Like normally dialogs works in applications I can make it modal, but if it is opened just with modality, when I focus MainFrame, dialog goes to back and MainFrame couldnt be interracted JDialog is modal.

Why cant I use the method from cartshelper, but can I use the method from productshelper In a normal rails app I can use any helper method on any view, right p  pIt might have to do something with the namespacing i.e. the helper files are not in codehelperscode but in codehelpersshopcode however a hrefhttpguides.rubyonrails.orgengines.htmlgeneratinganarticleresource relnofollowthis helps prevent conflicts with helpers from other engines or apps...ap  precodemodule Shop   module CartsHelper       def cartactionpackageid         some code       end   end end codepre  pHow I call it on codeshopproductsindex.html.erbcodep  precodelt cartactionpackage[id] gt codepre  pCould it have to do with the fact that I inherit functionality for my applicationscontroller from my main app p  precodeclass ShopApplicationController lt ApplicationController end codepre  pinstead of p  precodemodule Shop   class ApplicationController lt ActionControllerBase   end end codepre  pFWIW my routes for this engine looks likep  precodeShopEngine.routes.draw do     resources products, only [index]      shopping cart     resource cart, only [show] do         put addpackageid, to cartsadd, as addto         put removepackageid, to cartsremove, as removefrom     end  end codepre  pThanks for any help in advancep  pNote I do not want to use my helper method in my main app, rather just on another view in the same engine.p

Negative 28511 pis there a better way to implement this I have about three buttons that load UIViewControllers A, B, C on click. The app starts by loading A and then the user can click any button to load the other views. My views parse an XML using NSXMLParser and works fine. However parsing each xml is time consuming and so I want to cache or save each parsed xml so when the user return to the previous view say A after visiting say B, I wont have to do another parsing but will only load the cached result. I want to only parse again when the app starts or when user use Pulltorefresh  function. Thanks for your help.p

Negative 28511 pI have a node.js application. As all nontrivial applications, its split across many files. For simplicitys sake lets say there are two filesp  pcodeBase.tscodep  precodemodule MyNamespace      export class Base   codepre  pcodeDerived.tscodep  precode ltreference pathBase.ts gt  module MyNamespace      export class Derived extends Base   codepre  pIn TypeScripts terminology theyre eminternal modulesem. Now, I want to use a node.js module inside of the file codeDerived.tscode. The nave approach would be to just import it.p  precode ltreference pathBase.ts gt  ltreference pathnode.d.ts gt  import fs  requirefs  module MyNamespace      export class Derived extends Base          stats fs.Stats       codepre  pHowever, if we try to compile this code, well receive an error code2304 Cannot find name Basecode. This is happening because a module containing a top level codeimportcode or codeexportcode is an emexternal moduleem, and external modules cant be spread across files in other words, theyre emsealedem, as its called in Scala, C, and, perhaps, somewhere else. It, in turn, means that the file codeBase.tscode doesnt contribute to codeMyNamespacecode anymore. Even though I believe its a perfectly reasonable desire to have a common namespace and to be able to depend on other  external  modules.p  pIve tried some workarounds, but none of them was perfect.p  ul lipstrongUse codevarcode instead of codeimportcode.strong No top level import means the module does not become external. However, if we import a module with codevarcode we arent able to use it in type positions, only in value ones.pli lipstrongMake all the modules external.strong Basically, wed remove the namespace and instead of referencing the other modules in the files that depend on them use the codeimportcode statement. Like good old codeincludecode. Besides having to do a ton of requires it means that every module compiles to a separate file, and now to load the application we need to read a lot of files instead of one. pli lipstrongKeep everything in one file.strong Solves the problem with the sealness is there such a word of external modules. This one is good for small programs, but having a file thats bigger than even 1000 lines of code becomes unmanageable.pli lipstrongCreate a wrapper.strong If you have only a few modules to import, and theyre rather small, you can import them with codevarcode, and create wrappers that delegate the functionality. Obviously, not the cleanest solution and becomes cumbersome as the number of modules grow.pli ul  pSo, my question is stronghow to properly import a node.js module into a file containing an internal TypeScript module that is spread across multiple filesstrong. Also, Id like to understand why it isnt possible to go with my first nave approach.p

Negative 28511 pI cannot use DirectoryEntry AuthenticationTypes.SecureSocketsLayer using impersonation of application pool identity in a .NET web application. It works when using AuthenticationTypes.Secure but I have a requirement to use SSL instead over port 636. It also works when credentials are hard coded into the service call not acceptable for security reasons. I can also connect using SSL over port 636 using LDP.exe from the same box so I know it is not a connectivity or certificate issue. I think it is the double hop issue but I have tried configuring Kerberos delegation on the service account but I dont seem to have the correct configuration.

Negative 28511 pI am having trouble with Chromiumbased browsers and CORS requests that include 302 redirects.  More specifically, I am having trouble with Chromium versions 3442 inclusive 43 and later works, and it seems 33 and earlier versions worked as well I didnt test too far past 33, 28 worked.p  pMy XHR request uses withCredentialstrue, so AccessControlAllowOrigin is not allowed the server must reply with an AccessControlAllowOrigin header that echoes the incoming requests Origin header.p  pAfter receiving the first 302, Chromium 43 and later sends Origin null as part of the redirected request, and accepts AccessControlAllowOrigin null in response as does Firefox.  p  pThe Chromium series of 3442 all send the host name as Origin for all requests, and several issues from this time indicate that CORS redirects were emonlyem supported with AccessControlAllowOrigin set to , and that the original XHR must not have allowcredentials set to true, examplep  ul lia hrefhttpscode.google.compchromiumissuesdetailid154967 relnofollowhttpscode.google.compchromiumissuesdetailid154967ali ul  pI am hoping this is a misconception, and there is something as an app developer I can do on the client andor server to coerce those versions to not cancel the redirect, or failing that, ideas for a workaround.p  pVersion 33 amp earlier sent the entire host name for every request, and the full roundtrip works.p  pOne possibility for a workaround I have been experimenting with stems from the fact that, I actually do emnotem need withCredentialstrue for the crossdomain request, I only need it for the redirect back to the origin host to exchange cookiebased authentication for an accesstoken, but I could not find a way to get the client to send a cookie when following the 302 to itself unless it was also sent with the original crossdomain request.p  pTo illustrate, here are excerpts from a

Negative 28511 pI have a timedependent system of varying number of particles 100k particles. In fact, each particle represents an interaction in a 3D space with a particular strength. Thus, each particle has  X,Y,Zw which is the coordinate plus a weight factor between 0 and 1, showing the strength of interaction in that coordinate.  Here a hrefhttppho.to9Ztti relnofollowhttppho.to9Zttia  I have uploaded 10 realtime snapshots of the system, with particles are represented as reddish small dots the redder the dot, the stronger the interaction is. p  pThe question is how one can produce a 3D spatial density map of these particles, preferably in Matlab or Origin Pro 9 or a hrefhttpimagej.nih.govij relnofollowImageJa Is there a way to, say, take the average of these images based on the redcolor intensity in a hrefhttpimagej.nih.govij relnofollowImageJap  pSince I have the numerical data for particles X,Y,Zw  I can analyze those data in other software as well.

Negative 28511 pIm trying to write a PHP function that takes some text to be displayed on a web page, and then based on some entered search terms, highlights the corresponding parts of the text. Unfortunately, Im having a couple of issues.br To better explain the two issues Im having, lets imagine that the following innocuous string is being searched on and will be displayed on the web pagep  precodeMy daughter was born on January 11, 2011. codepre  pMy first problem is that if more than one search term is entered, any placeholder text I use to mark the start and end of any matches for the first term may then be matched by the second term.br For example, Im currently using the following delimiting strings to mark the beginning and end of a match upon which I use the codepregreplacecode function at the end of the function to turn the delimiters into HTML codespancode tagsp  precodehighlightStart highlightEnd codepre  pThe problem is, if I do a search like code2011 lightcode, then code2011code will be matched first, giving mep  precodeMy daughter was born on January 11, highlightStart2011highlightEnd. codepre  pUpon which when codelightcode is searched for, it will match the word codelightcode within both codehighlightStartcode and codehighlightEndcode, which I dont want.p  pOne thought I had was to create some really obscure delimiting strings in perhaps a foreign language that would likely never be searched on, but I cant guarantee that any particular string will never be searched on and it just seems like a really kludgy solution. Basically, I imagine that there is a better way to do it.br Any advice on this first point would be greatly appreciated.p  pMy second question has to do with how to handle overlapping matches.br For example, with the same string codeMy daughter was born on January 11, 2011.code, if the entered search is codeJan anuarcode, then codeJancode will be matched first, giving mep  precodeMy daughter was born on highlightStartJanhighlightEnduary 11, 2011. codepre  pAnd because the delimiting text is now a part of the string, the second search term, codeanuarcode will never be matched.p  pRegarding this issue, I am quite perplexed and really have no clue how to solve it.br I feel like I need to somehow do all of the search operations on the original string separately and then somehow combine them at the end, but again, Im lost on how to do this.br Perhaps theres a way better solution altogether, but I dont know what that would be.p  pAny advice or direction on how to solve either or both of these problems would be greatly appreciated.br Thank you.p

Negative 28511 pI have configured two application servers with HA Proxy to recover from failover situation. So I want to configure HA in such a way that if my 1st application server goes down, then only next requests forward to 2nd server, otherwise 2nd server must be seat as ideal only. I know that I am trying to disable actual purpose of HA Proxy, but thats what my requirement. My 2nd server is busy with other jobs and will help to serve request only if 1st server crashed. I will loose all sessions  from 1st server but that is OK for me.p  pIs it possible through HA Proxy configurations Please let me know.p

Negative 28511 pId like to set up an API versioning, similar to how Stripe does it but Im not quite sure how to make express do what I need. a hrefhttpsstripe.comdocsapiversioning relnofollowhttpsstripe.comdocsapiversioningap  pWhat Im looking for is, the proper route would be something likep  papiv1callp  pThe kicker is, Id like them to pass in a version revision like stripe allows, so if they sent a header like APIVersion 20150815, it would map to that specific version of the major version. So, v1 but the version updated on 20150815.p  pEssentially, if there is an update to the API call that is not backwards compatible, Id roll a new version for that particular call. Express would be smart enough to know that if a version isnt passed, use the latest. If a version is passed, use the latest version for each call up until the version date.p  pId assume the directory structure would be something likep  ul lirouterli lirouterv1li lirouterv1callli lirouterv1anotherCallli ul  pAnd maybe in the call directories, there is a index that checks for the header version and uses the proper file.p  pSo maybe for instancep  ul lirouterv1callindex.jsli lirouterv1call20150810.js  First versionli lirouterv1call20150815.js  Updated version that isnt backwards compat.li ul  pThoughts Ideasp

Negative 28511 pI have been making a living as a contracted webdeveloper for the past 3 years, and I decided to take it upon myself to learn how a computer strongactuallystrong works. I was really tunneling down the rabbit hole. My boss asked me why I wasnt putting in as many hours, and I told him, thinking hed be beaming with pride, that I was learning Assembly. To my surprise, he told me that I didnt need to learn assembly and should instead spend that time honing my JavaScript expertise.p  pI know that you could live a happy life as a JavaScript developer without having ever written a single assembly instruction. In fact, most of my peers have not learned Assembly or even C and seem to be very accomplished scripters with at least some concept of of lowlevel ideas like stacks and memory references.p  pSo, is it worth it for me to learn Assembly if my career only ever demands scripting Would it improve my ability to write good serverside or clientside scriptsp  pSorry for the subjective question.  I hope this is useful to other developers in my situation.p
