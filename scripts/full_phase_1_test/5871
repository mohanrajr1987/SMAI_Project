Positive 5871 pI mathematics, codex lt ycode is equivalent to codex gt ycode. This is true for floatingpoint arithmetic, emin most casesem, but not always. When codexcode or codeycode is NaN, codex lt ycode is strongnotstrong equivalent to codex gt ycode, because comparing a codeNaNcode to anything always returns codefalsecode. But still, codex lt y ltgt x gt ycode is true most of the time.p  pNow, suppose I am writing a class that contains floatingpoint values, and I want to define comparison operators for this class. For definiteness, suppose I am writing a highprecision floatingpoint number, which uses one or more codedoublecode values internally to store the highprecision number. Mathematically, the definition of codex lt ycode for this class already defines all the other operators if I am being consistent with the usual semantics of the comparison operators. But codeNaNcodes break this mathematical nicety. So maybe I am forced to write many of these operators separately, just to take into account NaNs. But is there a better way My question is emHow can I avoid code duplication as much as possible and still respect the behavior of codeNaNcodeemp  pRelated a hrefhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1590libsutilityoperators.htmhttpwww.boost.orgdoclibs1590libsutilityoperators.htma.

The web application Im writing is designed to help the universities, clinics where the students go for their experience, and students to be able to easily coordinate with each other.p  pIm using the Kohana framework, so a MVC architectural pattern. Here is the way I have structured the application right now.p  precode                      Controller                                                                                              Public                 Dashboards                                                                        Login  Recover Password                                                                                                                                                        Students     Universities      Clinics codepre  pSo under the public section users can either login or recover their password.p  pThe Dashboard section is accessible after the user has logged in, based on the type of user account they will either have a student, university, or clinic dashboard. Now of the three dashboard types, each dashboard will have a different set of controllers for what actions the users can take. So the above diagram actually also represents the controller inheritances. A Controller that is part of the Student dashboard has the following inheritance for one of their dashboard sectionsp  pcodeDashboard Sectioncode  codeStudent Dashboardcode  codeDashboardcode  codeControllercodep  pNow, this is all fine if each of the different codeDashboard Sectioncode for every different dashboard type is unique. As in, all of the actions that are part of that controller are only required for that specific controller.p  pHowever the thing is, some of the dashboard types DO have controllers in common. For instance each Dashboard type has a codeaccountcode controller. This controller allows the user to manage their account. The problem is, I dont want to write the exact same controller code for each codeaccountcode controller under the Student, University, and Clinic dashboards.p  pNow what would be nice is if each codeaccountcode controller could not only inherit from its respective dashboard type codeStudentcode, codeUniversitycode, or codeCliniccode, but could also inherit methods from a separate class perhaps called codeAccountControllercode, where I implement the proper actions for the account controller.p  pOf course PHP lacks multiple inheritance. So what would be the correct design pattern to implement here to keep my code very DRYp  pRight now I have a protected method in the codeDashboardcode class called codeaccountupdatecode that I just call in each of the codeAccountcode controllers for each dashboard type. However this seems really messy. Plus there are other situations where controllers that are common between dashboards will have more than one action.p

Negative 5871 pI recently bought a linode 1GB plan. Installed Apache on it, had my website up and running on it. However I installed a hrefhttpsgithub.comgitlabhqgitlabhq relnofollowgitlaba on the server and mapped it to a subdomain. Since the installation guides recommended using Nginx as the server, I installed it and is running on port 80. Currently my apache is not running since there are port conflicts. But I fixed it by editing the codeetcapache2ports.confcode file and instructing apache to serve on a different port. Now when I visit the main domain that is pointing to a port8000 and using apache doesnt show up. gitlab is installed at codehttpgitlab.myserver.comcode and I am able to access it., but if I try to navigate to codehttpmyserver.comcode, I get the content of codehttpgitlab.myserver.comcodep  pMy gitlab config serving under Nginx is as followsp  precode GITLAB  Maintainer randx  App Version 5.0  upstream gitlab   server unixhomegitgitlabtmpsocketsgitlab.socket   server    listen myserverip defaultserver   e.g., listen 192.168.1.180 In most    cases 80 is a good idea   servername gitlab.myserver.com          e.g., servername source.example.com   servertokens off      dont show the version number, a security best practice   root homegitgitlabpublic   individual nginx logs for this gitlab vhost accesslog  varlognginxgitlabaccess.log errorlog   varlognginxgitlaberror.log  location      serve static files from defined root folder.    gitlab is a named location for the upstream fallback, see below   tryfiles uri uriindex.html uri.html gitlab    if a file, which is not found in the root folder is requested,  then the proxy pass the request to the upsteam gitlab unicorn location gitlab    proxyreadtimeout 300  httpsgithub.comgitlabhqgitlabhqissues694   proxyconnecttimeout 800  httpsgithub.comgitlabhqgitlabhqissues694   proxyredirect     off    proxysetheader   XForwardedProto scheme   proxysetheader   Host              httphost   proxysetheader   XRealIP         remoteaddr    proxypass httpgitlab    codepre  pMy Apache config for codemyserver.comcode is as followsp  precode domain myserver.com  public homemepublicmyserver.com  ltVirtualHost 8000gt   Admin email, Server Name domain name, and any aliases  ServerAdmin webmastermyserver.com  ServerName  www.myserver.com  ServerAlias myserver.com    Index file and Document Root where the public files are located  DirectoryIndex index.html index.php  DocumentRoot homemepublicmyserver.compublic    Log file locations  LogLevel warn  ErrorLog  homemepublicmyserver.comlogerror.log  CustomLog homemepublicmyserver.comlogaccess.log combined ltVirtualHostgt codepre  pWhere am I going wrongp
Negative 5871 pIn the AngularJS docs it says emphasis minep  blockquote   pDirectives with greater numerical priority are compiled first. Prelink functions are also run in priority order, but postlink functions are run in reverse order. strongemThe order of directives with the same priority is undefined.emstrong The default priority is 0.p blockquote  pIt looks like the a hrefhttpsgithub.comangularangular.jsblob0d034a98ec4ef1e0c3c1727e23d1ccd971ae74e6srcngdirectiveinput.jsL855 relnofollowcodeinputDirectivecodea has no priority set, and neither does my custom directive which is also has a postlink function. Why does my custom directive get run first in the chain of codeparserscode and codeformatterscodep  pIt wasnt this way before code1.2.0rc3code, in fact I had to raise the priority of my custom directive to get its parsers and formatters to run before the codeinputDirectivecode.p  pAny insightp
