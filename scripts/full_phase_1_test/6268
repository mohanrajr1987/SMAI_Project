I get the error still if I go and test making wwwdata a superuser for the web server so I dont think it is a problem with permissions and is a problem with pathing. The documentation for the NCBI standalone blast dictates an appendage to the PATH variable and an introduction of another env variable to the database files in the same folder as the executable file. Currently, I have added the path location to the bin where the executable file is stored as an addition to the PATH variable in etcenvironment on my web server and added the other environment variable and I have also tried adding the another Environment variable to etcapache2envvars but I am still unable to execute. Thus I am wondering if anyone knows definitively where I should create additional environment variables or specify paths for Apache p
