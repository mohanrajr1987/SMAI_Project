For the following scenario even the consultant, who held the talk was unsure about, therefore I hope someone had the same problem. p  pI have a list of objects identified by a specific key.

Every day of these Years is identified by a character employee will work  A, employee wont be at work  B.

The example is only for a better imagination. Is it possible to implement a solution with solr  Other solution approaches also for the day representation are highly welcome. Right now we are dependent on the daily representation every day has one character. But if you deliver me a high performance solution even this is discussable.
