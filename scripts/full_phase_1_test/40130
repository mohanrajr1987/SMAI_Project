Negative 40130 pI have an Rbased GUI that allows some nontechnical users access to a stats model.  As it stands, the users have to first load R and then type codeloadGuicode at the command line.p  pWhile this isnt overly challenging, I dont like having to make nontechnical people type emanythingem at a command line.  I had the idea of writing a .bat file users are all running Windows, though multiplatform solutions also appreciated that starts R GUI, then autoruns that command.p  pMy first problem is opening RGui from the command line.  While I can provide an explicit path, such asp  precodeProgramW6432RR2.15.1bini386Rgui.exe codepre  pit will need updating each time R is upgraded.  It would be better to retrieve the location of RGui from the codepathcode environment variable, but I dont know an easy way to parse that.p  pThe second, larger problem is how to call commands for R on startup from the command line.  My first thought is that I could take a copy of code.Rprofilecode, append the extra command, and then replace the original copy of the file once R is loaded.  This is awfully messy though, so Id like an alternative.p  pRunning R in batch mode isnt an option, firstly since I cant persuade GUIs to display themselves, and secondly because I would like the R console available, even if the users shouldnt emneedem to use it.p  pIf you want a toy GUI to test your ideas, try thisp  precodeloadGui lt function    librarygWidgetstclck   win lt gwindowtest   rad lt gradioletters[13], cont  win  codepre
