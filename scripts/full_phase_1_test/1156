Positive 1156 pIm building a program for a class that pulls all bytes from a raw file in blocks of 512 bytes, searches the beginning bytes of each block for JPG signatures, and upon finding JPG signatures, writes out a JPG image. I have successfully pulled one JPG from the raw file, however the course indicates there are several more. After debugging in GDB, Ive noticed that the variable jpgname never seems to have a value, and also, stepping through the program, I regularly step to the fcloseinptr line, as if it were within the main while loop. Am I using GDB incorrectly Am I using sprintf incorrectly I would appreciate any feedback on this issue. p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltstdlib.hgt include ltstdint.hgt include ltstring.hgt  typedef uint8t  BYTE   int mainvoid       BYTE jpg1[4]  0xff, 0xd8, 0xff, 0xe0      BYTE jpg2[4]  0xff, 0xd8, 0xff, 0xe1      int open  0      FILE outp      char jpgname  mallocsizeofchar  8      int counter       TODO  MAKE sure this isnt a bunch of garbage data      open card file     FILE inptr  fopencard.raw, r      if inptr  NULL              printfCould not open filen         return 2           BYTE buffer[512]     freadbuffer, 512, 1, inptr      repeat until end of card         whilefreadbuffer, 512, 1, inptr gt 0                                  counter  0               start of new jpg             ifbuffer[0]  jpg1[0] ampamp buffer[1]  jpg1[1] ampamp buffer[2]  jpg1[2] ampamp buffer[3]  jpg1[3]  buffer[0]  jpg2[0] ampamp buffer[1]  jpg2[1] ampamp buffer[2]  jpg2[2] ampamp buffer[3]  jpg2[3]                               sprintfjpgname, d.jpg, counter                  if open  1                                      close                     fcloseoutp                     name new file                     outp  fopenjpgname, w                     write new                     fwritebuffer, sizeofbuffer, 1, outp                     counter                                  else if open  0                                      write new file                     outp  fopenjpgname, w                     fwritebuffer, sizeofbuffer, 1, outp                     open  1                     counter                                           else                              ifopen  1                                      fwritebuffer, sizeofbuffer, 1, outp                                          fcloseoutp     fcloseinptr            close any remaining files  codepre

So, what could be the reason my program unexpectedly started failing to write to filep  pPlease note Id prefer not to use codefprintfcode from my code, since time consumption is essential.p  hr  pThanks a lot, the problem was solved simply by using fflushstdout. I thought printing in a new line would flush the channel, but as paxdiablo explains in a comment here it doesntp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1716296whydoesprintfnotflushafterthecallunlessanewlineisintheformatstrinWhy does printf not flush after the call unless a newline is in the format stringap  pYou are right that one should offer as much as information as he can,but I thought  that sharing 100 lines of code for a single printf would be a drag for you to read. I see this was a bad decision, since not using fflush and the fact that the program is being terminated by a signal both contributed to the problem and should have been made known.p

Positive 1156 pJust started programming in highschool. Im having trouble writing this program. p  pThe details are as follows  Write a short program that requests your height in feet and inches and your weight in pounds. then the program will display your bmi. To calculate the bmi first convert your height to inches and then convert to meters by multiplying by 2.54x102. Then convert weight in pounds into kilograms by dividing by 2.2. Then compute bmi by dividing mass in kg by height in meters2.p  pWould i be using double or int for declaring anything in this program I still havent gotten the hang of what scenarios use what. And ive attempted to think ahead and see if i start from there but im not sure how my printf statement would look.p  pSample outputp  pEnter your height  feet 5  inches 8  What is your weight in pounds 139 p  pprintf statement A 5 foot by 8 inch adult of 139.0 pounds has a BMI of 21.2p  pI got stuck after declaring variables and not sure how else to continue. I can get the system.out.print statements for the height and weight but not sure how to get the equations set up or the final printf statement. An explanation to why a segment of code was used would be helpful but if not im sure i can figure it out on my own. Thanks for helping p  pNote Ive tried reddit but the one answer i got was vague and just kept saying google, and also tried yahoo answers but they were talking about terms i havent learned. Ive only been coding for 2 weeks so if possible please dont make the explanation too alien. If thats not avoidable ill just google the definitions haha. Anyways thanks againp

Negative 1156 pWhat happens if, after I memorymap a file using codemmapcode and flag codeMAPPRIVATEcode, I make changes to the underlying file while in the same process Will the codemmapcode memory pick up the changesp  pIn Linux, the man page saysp  blockquote   pMAPPRIVATE Create a private copyonwrite mapping. Updates to the mapping are not visible to other processes mapping the same file, and are not carried through to the underlying file. It is unspecified whether changes made to the file after the mmap call are visible in the mapped region.p blockquote  pSo in Linux, the answer is unspecified.p  pIn Mac OS X however it only saysp  blockquote   pMAPPRIVATE Modifications are private copyonwrite.p blockquote  pI did a quick sample tool that appears to show that making changes doesnt affect private mappings.

Negative 1156 pI have a strange behaviour when I want to upload files in a specific path.p  pI have created a new gallery photo on my Drupal website and I want to add many photos on this gallery. Initially Im not a Drupal developper... I tried the first time to put directly all the files on the corresponding folder sitesdefaultfilesgalleries, but I didnt know after that how to insert these photos on the page of the gallery...p  pSo, I have to use an Image Field to feed my gallery correctly... But I dont want the photos be uploaded on the default file folder sitesdefaultfiles. All the files in the same folder is a very bad practice... So, I use the File Field Paths FFP module version 7.x1.0beta4. In the File Field Path settings I use galleries[nodefieldgallery] as File path and it doesnt work. The photos are still uploaded into sitesdefaultfiles... Even if I dont use pattern, but just a hard path like galleriestest, this is the same. And also the same with the version 7.x1.xdev of the FFP module.p  pSomebody had the same issue Do you have a fix or a workaroundp  pTo be clear, my initial need was just to create a gallery with a lot of photos. So, if I could use the FTP, put all my photos on the server and after insert these photos on my gallery would be the best solution. But it doesnt seem possible. So, I dont want to use a simple Image Field because it would be crazy to add all the photos into the gallery one by one...And the Multi Upload module as well as the File attach from server directory function also put the files into sitesdefaultfiles...p  pSo, Im totally blocked now.p  pMy Drupal version is 7.39.p  pThanks a lot for your help p  hr  pUPDATEp  pI have found a workaround by updating the files path directly on database. Then, I just have to put my files in the path that I want. It works correctly, but as Im not a Drupal developer, Im a little bit afraid by potential side effects...p  pFor information, I have made the test right now to add a photo into a gallery with an old version of the website before updating Drupal from 7.22 to 7.34 and then 7.39, and before updating all the modules and it works correctly natively So, this situation is a regression bug because of the update of Drupal 7.22 or from one of the modules... A real challenge to identify the source of the regression by updating each element one by one... p
