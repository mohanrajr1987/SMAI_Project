Positive 688 pMy page loads all necessary data from the server at startup via AJAX. This includes users language settings, various classifiers, some business data etc.p  pThe problem I am facing is that when the user first comes to the page, all these different AJAX calls are kicked off at the same time. This means that on the server side, most of them are assigned different JSESSIONIDs I am using Spring on Tomcat 8 without any complex configuration. As a result, some of the data is initialized on the server side in one session, but the browser might end up using a different session in the end and does not have access to the data set up by earlier ajax calls.p  pI wanted to solve this by using a fast synchronous AJAX call in the very beginning so that after it returns and gets a JSESSIONID, all subsequent calls would be made in this original session.p  precode.ajaxapilanguage,      type GET,      cache false,     async false,     success functiondata           do stuff        more AJAX calls codepre  pIt works, but I get warning messages that synchronized XMLHttpRequest on main thread is deprecated. Now  I understand the reasons why such a synchronized call is bad for UI in general, but what other options are there available for me if I want to force all AJAX calls to use the same server side session p  pI can achieve the same result by using a callback and just placing all the rest of my page initialization code in there, executing it in the success section of the first AJAX call, but that wouldnt that have exactly the same effect as synchronizing on mainp
Positive 688 pI am using Laravel 5 laravelframework version is  v5.1.16, Homestead Ubuntu, with session driver  file.p  pI noticed that if a number of async AJAX requests jQuery are fired eg. in autocomplete search form field then the session variables are gone.p  pThis happens, only with async AJAX requests, when async option is set to false this problem no longer exists.p  pAlso, when session driver is set to cookie and async set to true there is a new cookie created on each AJAX request, so with 10 requests there will be 10 laravel cookies etc.p  pAny suggestions I have failed to find any decent cause or solution to this, except not using async requests.p  pRelated issues, which seems to be fixed.p  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comlaravelframeworkissues7549 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comlaravelframeworkissues7549ap  pa hrefhttpsgithub.comlaravelframeworkissues5416 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comlaravelframeworkissues5416ap
