Positive 45272 pI have been working on a way to take an image from the camera iOS only at the moment, downsample it to make it a reasonable size, then save it to local storage.  Since there are many smarter people out there than I, the code Ive been using is mostly grabbed from a hrefhttpsolvedstack.comquestionshtml5preresizeimagesbeforeuploading relnofollowSolvedStacka.  p  pThe problem is that sometimes the code works, but typically not.  It tends to fail on larger image files more often.  Since its intermittent, Im guessing perhaps something to do with asynchronous processing  I havent been able to find anything online discussing a similar issue, so Im hoping you might have some advice.p  pSymptoms include the resulting image not being shown correctly on the page, and it not being written to local storage.  The key is added, but the data portion is empty.  Debug shows the full resolution file, but the scaled down version is empty.  Further, it doesnt seem to matter too much if I remove the downsampling code and attempt to save the image full resolution it still fails.  The biggest full size resolution file Ive used is a png file just under 2M, with nothing else in the domains datastore.p  pCode            p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt  function handleFiles  var filesToUpload  document.getElementByIdinput.files var file  filesToUpload[0]  var img  document.createElementimg var reader  new FileReader  reader.onload  functione      console.logchange     img.src  e.target.result      var canvas  document.createElementcanvas     var ctx  canvas.getContext2d     ctx.drawImageimg, 0, 0      var MAXWIDTH  100     var MAXHEIGHT  100     var width  img.width     var height  img.height      if width gt height          if width gt MAXWIDTH              height  MAXWIDTH  width             width  MAXWIDTH               else          if height gt MAXHEIGHT              width  MAXHEIGHT  height             height  MAXHEIGHT                   canvas.width  width     canvas.height  height      ctx.drawImageimg, 0, 0, width, height      dataurl  canvas.toDataURLimagepng,0.7     document.getElementByIdimage.src  dataurl      window.localStorage.setItemimgData, dataurl    reader.readAsDataURLfile   ltscriptgt ltbodygt codepre

Positive 45272 pI have a Rails app that Im using with Backbone JS as a FE framework with Coffeescript syntax.

I also have a functionp  precodewindow.on hashchange, gt     window.localStorage.clear codepre  pHere is the strange part. For example I redirect to a products page with coderedirectToproductscode by some logic the localStorage needs to be cleared and I should not be able to use his values in the Router.

Negative 45272 pFirst of all, Hello for everybody and thanks for your help.p  pIm trying to implement the Observer Pattern in Delphi using Interfaces, so an Object could be a Subject and an Observer at the same time.p  pI have a class that implements ISubject, with the following methodp  precodeprocedure TSomeClass.Attachconst observer IObserver var   I Integer begin   if Fobservers  nil then   begin     Fobservers  TInterfaceList.Create   end   if Fobservers.IndexOfObserver lt 0 then     Fobservers.AddObserver end codepre  pI followed Joanna Carters example at a hrefhttpblogs.teamb.comjoannacarter20040630690 relnofollowhttpblogs.teamb.comjoannacarter20040630690a.p  pIn the application, I instantiate an object that implements the IObserver, and attach it to the TSomeClass object which implements ISubject as well.p  pThen I call the Notify method from the TSomeClass object and it works correctly. My problem occurs when I try to FreeAndNil my Observer object, because I get an Invalid Pointer Operation, even though Im using const in the parameter and when I reach the FreeAndNil line in debug mode, the object is properly assigned, with all properties set and with a random property changed inside the notify.p  pI noted that I couldnt Free my object anymore when I call this linep  precodeFobservers.AddObserver codepre  pIf I comment this line, then I can free my object. The code inside the application looks like thisp  precodeprocedure TfrmAlisson.Button2ClickSender TObject var   locSomeClass TSomeClass   locObserver TSomeObserverClass   I Integer begin   locObserver TSomeObserverClass.create394693   try     locSomeClass TSomeClass.create263151     try       locSomeClass.AttachlocObserver       locSomeClass.NotifyObservers     finally       FreeAndNillocSomeClass     end     ShowMessageIntToStrlocObserver.SomeProperty  This property is changed inside the notify   finally     locObserver.Free  error   end end codepre  pI would like to know why adding the IObserver to the TInterfaceList causes this Im using Delphi 2009.p
Negative 45272 pI dont understand why the following does not workp  precodeclass X     unsigned int sz public     Xconst unsigned int n  0  szn stdcout ltlt Default constructor called ltlt stdendl     Xconst Xamp x  szx.sz      XXampamp x  szx.sz stdcout ltlt Move constructor called ltlt stdendl   void fooXampamp x     stdcout ltlt x.size ltlt stdendl   int main     X x10     foostdmovex     fooX5     return 0  codepre  pThis program printsp  blockquote   pDefault constructor calledbr   Default constructor calledp blockquote  pI am aware that the move constructor is pointless in this example, since were not stealing anything, but shouldnt the move constructor still be called in these casesp  pEdit Using g 4.8.1 on windows.p
Negative 45272 pI am trying to create an overlay that can highlight certain portions of the page. The best way Ive figured out to do this is to use a canvas fit to the page, draw the shapes I need, and draw a rectangle using this trickp  precodectx.rectcanvas.width, 0, 0  canvas.width, canvas.height codepre  pIm not sure I can explain this well, so it might be best to look at the a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netmattwbarryESt8t5 relnofollowjsFiddle example herea to get an idea of what I am trying to do.p  pThis works perfectly in every browser except Safari. Is there any way to achieve this effect in Safarip
