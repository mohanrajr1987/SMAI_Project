Negative 12282 pIm pretty far along in a project and have hit an undesirable snag and unable to find a solution.  I have some sudo code that I believe will illustrate what I am trying to do but is not full code.  The error is NullPointerException on the ContextWrapper in the Main class when attempting to pass it to an ImageHandler.  Unfortunately, ImageViews and I suspect all Views, try to resolve their drawables before an activity has called the onCreate.  So I had to try and store images into the Activity Constructor but then I am unable to pass the context.  I have considered AsyncTask or the handler to wait for the onCreate of the activity but then I might as well go back to SurfaceView and creating my own designs.  I will continue to look but if someone with more android experience then me knows of either better design or the solution the help would be tremendous.  Also the eclipse layout previewer being compatible is highly preferred.  I have also tried to have each imageview independently have the desired layerdrawables even though alot of them are the same but the performance is terrible.  Had to add the constructor in the Activity because if the imagehandler is created in the onCreate it will be null when the the ImageView tries to call it on its constructor.
