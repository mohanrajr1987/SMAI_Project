Positive 829 pIn an items control I am using preparecontainerforitemoverride to add a custom style for each item.  If the items added are part of a new source I need to account for several things such as invalid data and duplicates, while if they are added to the current source I do not. Unfortunately, accounting for duplicates and invalid data is very expensive and I would like to minimize the number of items I have to. Is there a way I can know whether the items source has been changed in or before preparecontainerforitemovverridep  pI normally would use the event OnItemsSourceChanged, but it fires after preparecontainerforItemOverride.  p  pP.S. If there was a way to get the containers for each item in the new itemssource when OnItemsSourceChanged or OnItemsChanged fires that would also solve my problem.p  pThanks in advance.p

Thees no need to search the body of the reports for anything, only searching by name, user ID, run date etc.p  pI suspect the index searches the body of the docs, and as such the index crawls are taking a VERY long time  4 DAYS for the full, 15 hours for the incrementals.p  pIf I can tell search not to crawl the documents themselves, I think itll improve by an order of magnitude.p  pBut this may beg another question  if Im only interested in searching the metadata of the reports, is using the builtin search still the best and fastest method  Might I be better off using one of the other database query methods  It seems that Search would still be the best assuming I can cut off crawling the documents but I want to make sure.p
