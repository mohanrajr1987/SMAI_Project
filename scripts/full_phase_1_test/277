Positive 277 pNew with MSVS2015 is a memory profiling tool that can be used with the debugger. When analyzing a stapshot I can see the instance of an object. I would like to know what is referencing this object, however I cant seem to find a way.

Positive 277 pI dont know what has changed on my setup, but it used to be that when my Swift code crashed, the debugger would show the offending line of source code.p  pNow no matter what the problem is, the debugger only highlights the line in AppDelegate.swift where UIApplicationMain is defined.p  pI can tell by putting in print statements more or less where in the code the problem arose, however... whats the point of having a debugger if it never conveys any information and I just have to do everything old school with print statements  especially if there are asynchronous processes going on in which the print statement isnt necessary a reliable indicator of where the crash occuredp  pIve seen threads from years ago that talk about going into Preferences  Behaviors and modifying what gets shown when the code exits unexpectedly.  But a I never needed this in the past, and more importantly b this seems to have no effect, i.e. the debugger is still just quitting on main.p  pIs there a good way to get the old, specific, debugging behavior back   p  pIm currently running Xcode 7.0,   but this behavior occurs with 7GM Seed, and even now when I go back to try 7 beta 5 and beta 6, which used to work.p
