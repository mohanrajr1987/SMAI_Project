Positive 5725 pHi right Im just creating the foriegn keysrelationships in sql server management studio, but Ive come across a bit of a problem. I have several tables lets call them p  precodemyform1,  myform2,  myform3 codepre  pWhen filling out any of these myforms I keep a record of that. In another table lets call that forms In forms I have these fieldsp  precodeformid formtype  I store the type of form 1,2,3 myformid  I store the id of the form. codepre  pHow do I correctly show this on my sql server management relationship.p  pIve cut down the problem and there are obviously more fields but the situation is the same. p

Do I define the relationship in the User modelp  precodeclass User extends Model implements AuthenticatableContract,  CanResetPasswordContract       public function leaveRequests              return thisgthasManyAppLeaveRequest        codepre  por do I define it in the UserProfile modelp  precodeclass UserProfile extends Model       public function leaveRequests              return thisgthasManyAppLeaveRequest        codepre  pI ask this question because if you look at the foreign key relationship on the leaverequests table, it is  related to the users table, so personally I would define the eloquent relationship on the Users model. However not all users will submit leave request for example if your the website admin user. p  pSo would it be better for me to change the table relationship so that the foreign key userid on the leaverequests table is related to the userprofiles table instead and add the eloquent relationship to the UserProfile modelp  pHow would you guys implement this This becomes very confusing when you are forced to use a single users table to accomodate authentication and then having to create separate 1 to 1 tables to store the different user type attributes.  The foreign key relationships become slightly blurred. Normally Id have separate tables for each type of user i.e users, admin etc  there would be no profile table. But then the authentication become more complex to implement.p  pPlease share your thoughts and how you would go about implementing the above.p

Positive 5725 pI have a rails app in which a model named codeClassEventscode belongs to the codeUserscode model. Id like to flag codeUserscode with codeisapprovedcode and use some logic in my view to decide whether a codeClassEventcode should be shown. p  pIdeally, I dont have to look into the codeUserscode table each time I need to figure out if the codeClassEventcodes parent codeUsercode has the codeisapprovedcode flag set.p  pMy plan is to create the codeisapprovedcode row in the codeUsercode table and a separate codeisapprovedcode row in the codeClassEventcode table. This feels redundant and an opportunity for nasty bugs. p  pIs this a case for a foreign key in codeClassEventcodep  pWhats the correct emRails wayem for this situationp

Negative 5725 pIm trying to use Ruby 1.9.1 for an embedded scripting language, so that enduser code gets written in a Ruby block.  One issue with this is that Id like the users to be able to use the return keyword in the blocks, so they dont need to worry about implicit return values.  With this in mind, this is the kind of thing Id like to be able to dop  precodedef thingargs, ampblock   value  block.call   puts valuevalue end  thing    return 6  7  codepre  pIf I use return in the above example, I get a LocalJumpError.  Im aware that this is because the block in question is a Proc and not a lambda.  The code works if I remove return, but Id really prefer to be able to use return in this scenario.  Is this possible  Ive tried converting the block to a lambda, but the result is the same.p
