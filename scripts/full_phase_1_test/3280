Positive 3280 pI am trying to get a Camel route to perform an action based on a conditional statement if that condition is true, then it will execute the action. However, if that condition is false, then the action will not be executed.p  pThe conditional statement is based on the value of a property that is being pulled from a .properties file. I have defined a codeplaceholderPrefixcode and codeplaceholderSuffixcode for the properties within a bean which are codecode and codecode respectively. In case it helps, that definition looks as followsp  precodeltbean idcom.example.springPropertyConfigurer     classcom.example.PropertiesSpringPlaceholderConfigurergt     ltconstructorarg index0         typecom.example.PropertiesInterface         refcom.example.Properties gt     ltproperty nameplaceholderPrefix value gt     ltproperty nameplaceholderSuffix value gt     ltproperty nameignoreUnresolvablePlaceholders valuetrue gt ltbeangt codepre  pThe snippet of code I currently have looks like thisp  precodeltcamelchoicegt     ltcamelwhengt         ltcamelsimplegtcom.example.PropertyKey  trueltcamelsimplegt             ltcamelto uriexecutingTargetAction gt     ltcamelwhengt     ltcamelotherwisegt         lt Empty block so that nothing happens gt     ltcamelotherwisegt ltcamelchoicegt codepre  pAs of right now, this method does not give me the desired outcome.p  pI have tried using both codeltxpathgtcode and codeltspelgtcode instead of codeltsimplegtcode to see if they work, but it seems like these expression languages all expect the lefthand side of the condition to contain an codeExchangecode object from a Camel route. I do not want to compare anything to an Exchange object  I only want to compare the property from the properties file to the given literal that I provide which, in this case, is the boolean value true.p  pI am open to using any Camel expression languages besides codeltsimplegtcode and the others listed above that will perform this task.p

Negative 3280 pSuppose we have an application on a server that has a set of resources these resources are indexed by name through a dictionary, that is codeDictionaryltstring, Resourcegt resourcescode.p  pThe client sends to the server using WCF the names of one or more resources for example, it sends a codeListltstringgtcode. On the server there may be only a subset of the resources requested by the client, so when a server receives this list, it sends back a list containing only the names of found resources.p  pI would like to generalize the search criteria that the client sends to the server, so that in future it is easy to extend the application both clientside and serverside with a more complex search criteria. To achieve this goal, I thought to create the codeISearchCriteriacode interface, so the client should send an object of a class which implements this interface.p  precodepublic interface ISearchCriteria       the names of the resources which match with the search criteria     ICollectionltstringgt GetCompliantResources  codepre  pHowever it seems to me that this solution is not very correct, because the codeGetComplianceResourcescode method should interact with the dictionary on the server, but the client should not know anything about this dictionary...

In this way could separate the control logic from the data ie. the search criteria.p  pstrongUPDATE strategy pattern and DTOstrongp  precode Both on the server and on the client public interface ISearchCriteria       empty    Both on the server and on the client public class DefaultSearchCriteriaDTO  ISearchCriteria      Listltstringgt ResourceNames  get set      Listltintgt OtherCriteria  get set     Both on the server and on the client public class MySearchCriteriaDTO  ISearchCriteria      string SearchString  get set     On the server. public interface IStrategyltTgt  where T  ISearchCriteria      public Listltstringgt MatchT criteria    On the server public class DefaultStrategy  IStrategyltTgt where T  DefaultSearchCriteriaDTO      public Listltstringgt MatchT criteria               search for resources and returns those found       codepre  ul liIs there some design pattern for this purposeli liAre there better alternativesli ul
