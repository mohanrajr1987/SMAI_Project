Positive 4557 pI have a mixed managed and unmanaged C application thats working quite well. Im using Visual Studio 2013 to compile it, and all is well. Recently I upgraded my computer to Windows 10, and now its not working.p  pIf I get the executable compiled on Windows 8, it runs properly on Windows 10. It only fails if I compile it on Windows 10.p  pThe failure is peculiar as well. I run the EXE and nothing happens. When I run it from Visual Studio it doesnt even reach the first line of codemaincode. Breakpoints are all marked as disabled. When I break the running process the debugger shows an empty stack trace.p  pUPDATE Hunch about DLL loading turned into a factp  pI used a hrefhttpstechnet.microsoft.comenussysinternalsbb896653.aspx relnofollowProcess Explorera and I see the process has two threads. The one starting at CorExeMain is stuck at LdrLoadDll, but I cant tell which DLL that is.p  pOK, found the DLL that causes the problem. Ive created a CCLI console application, used that DLL and got the same behavior. The DLL is part of the application and part of the VS solution. Its a native C DLL, compiled with the same compiler and settings. This DLL references emotherem DLLs unfortunately.p

Positive 4557 pI am updating a program written by someone else in CCLI to control a variety of different cameras. This program uses a class to control each camera type. My class is called ZylaDriver. I am fairly new to C and CCLI, so thank you in advance for your help and patience.p  pThe SDK for the camera I am using has one function,ATQueueBuffer, to allocate memory to read data into. Once an image has been acquired, ATWaitBuffer can be used to return a pointer to the acquired data.p  pI would like to have two separate class functions which call these functions, ZylaDriverexpose, and ZylaDriverreadImageUInt16  Buffer. p  pHowever, I am running into problems with memory access going between functions. As it stands, the code below produces a System.AccessViolationException when I attempt to assigned to StridelessBuffer in ZylaDriverreadImage.p  pI believe that my problem is possibly related to deficiencies in my understanding of how managed memory works in CCLI.
