Positive 14456 pBeginner here.p  pI have an application built in MFC Vicual C, compiled using VS2010. I have a DSN as an ODBC connection to a live Excel spreadsheet via Excel driver.p  pMy app queries a spreadsheet every second. If one cells value changes a result of a simple calculation involving other cells receiving a live data feed, the app prints the new value then goes back to querying for changes.p  pThe App works fine for a period of time, dutifully printing the changes in the cells value as new data arrives in the feed. Then, it invariably generates an errorp  pThe Microsoft Jet Engine could not find the object unknown Make sure the object exists and that you spell its name and the path name correctly.p  pThe file paths are all given in absolutes.p  pI surmise that the error is generated whenever the query happens to exactly coincide with the cells contents being updated. I can generate the exact same error message and behavior, always, instantly, by clicking on the surveyed cell and touching a key beginning to edit the cell, here by overtyping the cell formula.p  pAn Afx error dialog runs. If I OK and select the excel file, the application goes back and runs, until a new same error. But if I select Cancel the application exits. p  pIf I comment out my own error catch, this dialog still appears.p  pI would like the application to run headless and merely retry to connect with the database. p  pIs there any way I can override herep  pI realize Excel is not amenable to concurrent multiuser access. But I dont need to have concurrent access I dont care to see the cell when something else is changing it. I simply want to wait and retry.p  pApologies in advance for asking about dinosaur bonetech here. The fact I need to query live data has led me by trialanderror to ODBC libxl sees only the file data and formulas, rather than their values.p
