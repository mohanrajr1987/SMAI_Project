Positive 46457 pI have a list of data frames, all with the same structure. I need to recode a variable in each data frame based on the value of another variable. Ive found solutions here that have gotten me close, but after many hours, Im still coming up short.p  pMy data frames look like thisp  precodeTest14    Class Total 1    201     1 2    203    14 3    204     3 4    205     7 5    206     7 6    207     1 7    211     2 8    212     1 9    213    16 10   288    27 11   299     9 12   517     1 13   592     2 14   593     8 codepre  pEach Class code falls into a larger MajorClass category. Im trying to attach another those MajorClass so that I can the data into plain English.

The closes I came was using the following codep  precodegt MajorClass lt lapplymydata, functioni  gt     iMajorClass lt  gt     if iClass  200  iClass  202  iClass  203  iClass        204  iClass  205  iClass  206  iClass  gt 207  iClass  208  iClass  209  iClass  210  gt iClass  211  iClass  212  iClass  216  iClass  gt 234   iClass  278   iClass  295  gt          iMajorClass lt Reg Residential gt     else gt         if iClass  239  iClass  240  iClass  241  iClass  201  iClass  213  iClass  224  iClass gt  225  iClass  236  iClass  288  iClass  290  iClass  297  iClass  299  gt             iMajorClass lt NonReg Residential ... and so on ... codepre  pBut it returns only one value for the last record in each data frame. Ive tried multiple variations on this, and have attempted to use a for loop, all to no avail. Also, my limited understanding is its more efficient to use the apply functions instead of for loops. p  pAny help or pointing in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. As I said, Ive searched a lot on this site and others and came close but not close enough. Thanks again p
