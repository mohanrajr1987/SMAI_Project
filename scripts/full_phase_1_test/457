Negative 457 pI have been reading up on directed graphs.  I have managed to get an abstract graph data type working in my application but I dont find it particularly intuitive and am considering replacing it with an ordinary multidimensional array.p  pMy graph is sparse and acyclic.  Each vertex is reachable from one particular master vertex.  If it was a tree, this master vertex would be the root.  It it was a social network, this master vertex would be me.p  pAlthough my graph may have hundreds of thousands of vertices it has a finite depth the greatest distance between any two nodes is 3 edges. p  pThe underlying data representation is an adjacency list.  A small example would look like thisp  precodeHead  Tails    1   2, 3, 4   2   5     3   5   4   5   5   6 codepre  pIf I was using an ordinary multidim array instead of my graph data type, it would look something like thisp  precodeme[1][2][5][6] me[1][3][5][6] me[1][4][5][6] codepre  pNow, the main things that I want to be able to do with this graph arep  ol liNavigate it as a hierarchy.  I realise that some child vertices will feature in more than one category e.g. 5, but that is what I want for this particular use case.  I cant see any real difference between an array and a graph for this point.li liLay it out as a list alphabetical, according to vertex name, with no duplicates.  I would probably do a DFS, flagging visited vertices as I go, to avoid exploring them more than once.  But as far as I can see this is achievable using either the graph or the array, and at the same cost.li liDo an all paths analysis for any given pair of points.  Because I want all paths ie. Im not simply checking for reachability, it seems to me that I have to traverse the entire graph, and again I can see no advantage in a graph over an array.li ol  pI get the feeling that I am missing something, but I cant put my finger on it.  Can you  Any ideas, suggestions, insights or advice gratefully accepted...  By the way, Im using PHP, and the data source is a relational DB.  I dont think this makes any real difference though.p  pThanksp
