Negative 32307 pIve been banging my head on this issue for about 2 hours now.  This makes no sense to me.  Im trying to to write a simple form helper that is 3 level nested. Im aware that 3 level nests are not recommended, but just roll with me here for a second.p  pMy routes.rb excerpt looks like thisp  precoderesources vendors, path , except [new, create] do    resources itemlinks do     resources messages   end    resources projects do     resources designs   end  end codepre  pNow when I render the following, it errors outp  precodelt formfor [vendor, itemlink, Message.new], url vendoritemlinkmessagespath, method post, remote true do f gt  No route matches actiongtindex, controllergtmessages, vendoridgtthearborist, projectidgt4fad5bd7, idgt77ec58b5 missing required keys [itemlinkid] codepre  pIm specifying the url here because my Vendor class and my ItemLink class both have subclasses sti and if I dont specify the url, I end up with the fully qualified route which I dont want.p  pBased on the error, its ignoring the codemethodcode param I specified entirely because its trying to access the index action instead of the create action.  Secondly, its inserting a codeprojectidcode param into the equation for some reason that makes no sense.  Nowhere in either the params specified or the url path I listed does it reference project.p  pFurthermore, I decided to go specific and list out routes to my specfic subclassesp  precoderesources vendorarborists do   resources itemlinkstandards do     resources messages   end end codepre  pThis still blows up with the same sort of errorp  precodelt formfor [vendor, itemlink, Message.new], url vendorarboristitemlinkstandardmessagespath, method post, remote true do f gt  No route matches actiongtindex, controllergtmessages, vendoridgtthearborist, projectidgt4fad5bd7, idgt77ec58b5 missing required keys [vendorarboristid, itemlinkstandardid] codepre  pOnly when I remove the url param entirely does it finally start workingp  precodelt formfor [vendor, itemlink, Message.new], method post, remote true do f gt codepre  pTo add to the mystery, as if this isnt screwed up enough, the second set of routes I specified above work just fine with or without the URL specified and with or without the subclasses specified.p  precode    lt formfor [vendor, project, Design.new], url vendorprojectdesignspath, method post, remote true do f gt codepre  pSo Im now completely confused as to what is going wrong.  My models are all very basic, these are simple Rails 101esque routes.  Ill post any other details if anyone needs them to debug this, but I dont know where else to look.  What the hell am I doing wrongp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pSo after continuing with the testing, it seems this works as well.  I suppose I can move forward with this, but that doesnt explain why it works in the example above for Design, but fails in all the examples with Message.  Overall, it seems something in Rails 4 is causing these route helpers to get screwed up, because these examples all behaved just fine in Rails 3.2 which Im migrating over from.p  pCredit to a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21233509rails4shallowroutesresourceformsubmissionnotworkingrq1Rails 4 shallow routes resource form submission not workingap  precodelt formfor Message.new, url vendoritemlinkmessagespathvendor, itemlink, method post, remote true do f gt codepre  pAdditional readingbr   a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21868544rails4bestpracticesnestedresourcesandshallowtruerq1Rails 4 [Best practices] Nested resources and shallow trueap  pstrongThe Controller Methodstrongp  pThis is the method that is rendering the view which contains my busted form helper.

Negative 32307 pstrongProblem link stronga hrefhttpswww.hackerrank.comchallengesjimandtheskyscrapers relnofollowhttpswww.hackerrank.comchallengesjimandtheskyscrapersap  pstrongProblem Statementstrong    Let us describe the problem in one dimensional space. We have in total N skyscrapers aligned from left to right. The ith skyscraper has a height of hi. A flying route can be described as i,j with ij, which means, Jim starts his HZ42 at the top of the skyscraper i and lands on the skyscraper j. Since HZ42 can only fly horizontally, Jim will remain at the height hi only. Thus the path i,j can be valid, only if each of the skyscrapers i,i1,...,j1,j is not strictly greater than hi and if the height of the skyscraper he starts from and arrives on have the same height. Formally, i,j is valid iff k[i,j]hkhi and hihj.p  pstrongMy Approach strongp  pI have used stack. If next integer is lesser than top of stack, it is pushed into the stack. If it is greater, strongtop of stack first topstrong is popped and compared with the top of stack. If they are equal counter is increased and again top is popped and new top is compared with previous strongtop of stack first topstrong. Process is repeated till strongtop of stack first topstrong is not equal to the top of stack.p  pFinally If stack is not empty, I am again counting  duplicate element. This counters of a specific element are stored in an array list on the fly.p  pstrongemIs this a good approach Is stack the right choice Can my code be improvised to speed upemstrong p  pMy code is correct but few test cases are terminated due to timeout.p  pstrongInput Formatstrongp  pThe first line contains N, the number of skyscrapers.
