Negative 45217 pFirst, let me say, that I find the sfFormPropel forms interface inconsistent. There is codebindcode, which returns nothing, but triggers validation, codesavecode which returns the saved object, and codebindAndSavecode, which returns boolean, actually the return value of codeisValidcode. Now, I have a working application, but I dont feel the code is right, and Im quite new to codesymfonycode, so perhaps Im missing something.p  pThe object I need to create needs some external properties, that are not presented in the form, are external to the model, and are handled by the application for example, the userId of the user, that created the entity, an externalgenerated guid, etc.. p  pRight now the flow is as followsp  ul liget values from request and bind them to formli licheck if form is validli liif its valid, add additional values and bind them to form one more timeli lisave the form and return the objectli ul  pThe obvious answer would to add applicationspecific values to the values, retrieved from request, but emIt does not make sense to bind the applicationspecific values if the form is not valid,  since they can be potentially expensive operations, may create database records, etc.em Additionally, it should not be possible to pass those values with the post request, they should come from application only.p  pNow, I though that I have to let the model do these things, but since the data is external to the model, action still need to pass it to the model. The problem is, if I call codeformgtgetObjectcode after codebindcode, it still has the old data, and not the data submitted.p  pWhat is the correct way to implement this kind of postprocessingp  pemSecond bounty is started to award the other valuable answeremp
