Positive 162 pRolling out product for multiple languages and platforms Not me. I just want to create a onemethod DLL that returns Hello World and install it on my own computer, then communicate with it from Classic ASP or MS Access.p  pThe code in the DLL is no problem. Discovering all relevant property sheets and filling them out correctly are. Its almost comical, after attempting an install, to see which property sheet values are used as file paths, which are in the registry, which are in the installuninstall page, and so on. Who would expect the name of the INSTALL PROJECT to be used as the ACTUAL PRODUCTS file pathp  pBut today I limit my question to this Should any GUID in my WiX project also be found in my DLL My interface and class both have GUIDs. Do those need to be in the installer code, so the installer can add those to the registry Or are those GUIDs needed in the registry If not there, then how are they usedp  pJust trying to create a simple test to see WHAT WORKSp

Positive 162 pThe Visio Page objects SetFormulas and GetResults methods requires an array containing ShapeID,Section,Row,Column, in order to batch readwrite fromto the shapesheet.p  pHowever, I find that in drawings with a lot of shapes, after adding and deleting shapes, Visios shape IDs cross over the short integer limit of 32768.  It seems Visio keeps a short integer ID property on shapes called ID16, but passing the ID16 into that ShapeID,Section,Row,Column array does not seem to work, and raises an Unexpected End of File error.p  pIs it possible somehow to use the SetFormulas and GetResults methods on drawings where shape IDs have crossed over the short integer limit  Or is there a way to restack shape IDs in a drawing such that, as long as there are less than 32768 shapes in the page, then all the IDs will be below the limit  I know that copying all the shapes into a new drawing will buy some time, but the issue could quickly recur after addingremoving shapes from the page, which my software does a lot of.p  pThe only other alternative I can think of is to capture cases where the shape ID has exceeded the short integer limit, and revert to routines that do operations cell by cell and shape by shape, rather than in a single batch.p
