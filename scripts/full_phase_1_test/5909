Positive 5909 pI implemented an app, inside theres a button to start a codeCountDownTimercode and a TextView to display time left. Someone told me that the timer should run on other thread rather than on main thread, but as I start the timer normally, it s on the main thread p  precodetimer  new CountDownTimermin  60000, 1000              Override             public void onTicklong millisUntilFinished                  tick                 setChanged                 notifyObservers                 clearChanged                 Log.vTHREAD TIMER  ,   Looper.myLooper.getThread.getName                           Override             public void onFinish                  end  true                 setChanged                 notifyObservers                 clearChanged                       codepre  pI use an Observer to update the TextView each time the timer tick, and the code which update the TextView, is also run on the main thread I confirm it with codeLooper.myLooper.getThread.getNamecode. But it didnt affect the TextView at all, but it did print out the debugging that I put to test. Anybody have any idea to fix this p  hr  pNow this is even more confused. I extract the timer part, and formed a new project. Now, it worked.

Negative 5909 pMy project WPF, .Net 4.5, EF6 has to target different DBMS, so far its MSSQL, Oracle, MySql and Firebird. I started with creating dbsdependent scripts that generate the databases and then used Entity Frameworks DatabaseFirstapproach to create the models. By having a default edmx based on MSSQL and creating separate ssdls for the other providers the differing ssdlfiles can be configured in the connection strings it all worked pretty good for all dbms. The problem I see now is maintaining installationupdates for 4 or more different dbms for even many more customers. We wont send admins to install updates at our customers, we rather need something like a generic setupupdate routine for all. Its possible but you would have to maintain different versions of sql scripts for each dbms and kind of a setup tool that handles those scripts and knows which to execute for which database depending on dbms and current version.p  pWhen looking for alternatives I came across EF Code First Migrations and tried switching to this approach. My tries are based on MSSQL and MySql so far.p  pIt all works good when I stick to either MSSQL or MySql. Creating migrations, applying them to existing or nonexisiting databases, all this works pretty fine. But Im stuck with bringing both system together. Applying MSSQLbased migrations to MySql for example seems to be impossible. The database will be created but its not possible to connect due to type mismatches and so on. My guess is that the MigrationTable contains a model which was created based on MSSQL and is incompatible with the MySqlprovider now. Just a theory but maybe someone knows better.p  pDoes anyone know a solution for this Is there any way to target different dbms with EF I cant believe that I am the only one with this problem but its really hard to find any information about this. Any help is appreciated, even directing me to other approaches than using EF that way or using EF at all.p

Negative 5909 pI want to know, is there any way to develop games for Androidbased mobiles and maybe iPhone in strongCstrong Yep, i know about emMonoDroidMono for Androidem, but well... its not free. strongJavastrong is great but emDalvikem performance is far worse than emMonoem. And it lacks of some features that are very useful for game development such as operator overloading. Furthermore, there is emOpenTKem framework which is simply amazing.p  pSo, is it possible to get running em.NETMonoem on emAndroidem strongemfor freeemstrong Or am I sentenced to strongJavastrongp

Negative 5909 pSuppose I want to have path look like this     Servlet1id34Servlet2p  pI want to access Servlet2 depending on the id parameter received in Servlet1, but when I try to do so system access service methods of Servlet1 only and do not go to Servlet2p  pI just want to skip the code for Servlet1 and move to Servlet2 when my path is strongServlet1id34Servlet2strong otherwise run code in Servlet 1 when path is strongServlet1id34strongp  pI am not sure when such approach is to be used, where you access a Servlet which is like a descendent to another servlet. If I am taking any concept wrong kindly correct or else suggest some solution to make it workp  pstrongEDITstrong If user enters strongServlet1id34strong then it shows an entirely different page and when user enters strongServlet1id34Servlet2strong I want to show a different page based on the strongidstrong specified in Servlet1.p  pProblem is that the URI that I get in Servlet1 when user enter path strongServlet1id34Servlet2strong is only strongServlet1strong i.e. Servlet2 is nowhere in URI so how do I identify which Servlet user is looking forp
