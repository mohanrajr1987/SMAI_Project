Positive 1972 pI have an application that has a bunch of legacy cgi pages and a gwt project. When I navigate from from one gwt page to another the rendering time is good.

It does do some writing to the log before it errors out, so it gets past creating the file just fine.p  pWhat seems to be the problem is that previously only one class created an instance of the log class, and now Ive added instances to other classes.  It makes sense that this would create problems.  Changing the LogLock field to be static fixes the issue.p  pThanks againp
