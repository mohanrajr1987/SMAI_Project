Positive 4075 pI am using SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL. Some of my queries involved joining related tables and filtering based on values in the joined tables. At times these joins and and filters can be multiple relationships deep. My problem is that I have not found a way to get a reliable number of results when using limit. I understand that limit is affecting the row count and not the count of toplevel model objects returned by my query. Are there any techniques or tricks for getting around this issuep  pHere is a simple and probably bad example. Imagine a database with tables and corresponding SQLAlchemy model classes for codeCompanycode, codeDepartmentcode, and codeEmployeecode. Obviously there can be many departments in a company and many employees in a department. I might try to get 20 companies with employees named Bob like thisp  precodequery  Company.query query  query.joinDepartment query  query.joinEmployee query.filterEmployee.name  Bob query.limit20 result  query.all codepre  pAssuming there are many Bobs out there, this query will not yield 20 companies. Is there a way to structure such a query to return a specific count of companies when joining and filtering in this mannerp

Positive 4075 pI am working on a Flaskpythonsqllite application in which I can do the db migration through the browser. If I am adding a NEW table in my models and then run the migration everything works alright. But if I want to add a column in an existing table, sqlalchemy wreaks havoc. It wont even let me start the application let alone run the migration, complaining such and such column is NOT in the table. I can run migrations through the terminal, but that is not the point. My ultimate aim is to do all db manipulations through the browser. Create Table, Delete Table, Add Column delete column etc as I am currently doing in all my custom CMS web sites in PHPMySql, though I am in the very beginning stage of the current task.p  pAny ideas to achieve this in flaskpython p
