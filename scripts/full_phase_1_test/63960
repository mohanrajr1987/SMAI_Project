Positive 63960 pI have this situation where I want to make use of included files in order to organize my views templates.p  pFor example, my simplest layout is the followingp  precodeltDOCTYPE htmlgt lthtml langesgt ltheadgt      include templatespartialshtmlhead.php  ltheadgt ltbodygt      ltPage content gt      block content  endblock       lt General js such as jquery, bootstrap.jsgt      include templatespartialsassetsjs.php       lt Specific or custom JS. gt      block js  endblock  ltbodygt lthtmlgt codepre  pAnd the included file, that contains the html head tag is the followingp  precodeltmeta charsetutf8gt ltmeta httpequivXUACompatible contentIEedgegt ltmeta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth, initialscale1gt ltmeta namedescription contentx contentgt lttitlegtGeneral title   block title  endblock lttitlegt   include templatespartialsassetscss.php  lt Custom style css. gt  block style  endblock  codepre  pBefore separating the files, I put the title originally in the title and, if a view I typed an aditional title, it worked. But now it doesnt. For example, if in the home view, I typed the followingp  precode block title  Home  endblock  codepre  pI could see in the page title up in the browser General title  Home.

Negative 63960 pWhile playing about with optimisation settings, I noticed an interesting phenomenon functions taking a variable number of arguments code...code never seemed to get inlined. Obviously this behavior is compilerspecific, but Ive tested on a couple of different systems.p  pFor example, compiling the following small programmp  precodeinclude ltstdarg.hgt include ltstdio.hgt  static inline void testconst char format, ...    valist ap   vastartap, format   vprintfformat, ap   vaendap   int main    testHello sn, world   return 0  codepre  pwill seemingly always result in a possibly mangled codetestcode symbol appearing in the resulting executable tested with Clang and GCC in both C and C modes on MacOS and Linux. If one modifies the signature of codetestcode to take a plain string which is passed to codeprintfcode, the function is inlined from codeO1code upwards by both compilers as youd expect.p  pI suspect this is to do with the voodoo magic used to implement varargs, but how exactly this is usually done is a mystery to me. Can anybody enlighten me as to how compilers typically implement vararg functions, and why this seemingly prevents inliningp

Negative 63960 pIn a hrefhttpnimrodcode.org relnofollowNimroda I can write the following code to import an external modulep  precodeimport myFancyPantsModule ...  And here Id use the fancyPants proc codepre  pThis works fine as long as I have the module, but for people who might download the code and not have the module installed compilation will fail with a not very user friendly messagep  precode nimrod c fancyProgram.nim fancyProgram.nim1, 7 Error cannot open myFancyPantsModule codepre  pIs there any way I can wrap around the codeimportcode so that I can emcatchem it similar to an exception and execute an alternative branch of code similar to the codewhencode statement I was hoping to find some codeimportablecodelike macro or something which I could use likep  precodewhen importablemyFancyPantsModule      And here Id use the fancyPants proc else     quitOh, sorry, go to httpsgithub.comnimrodcodebabel and install  amp        the myFancyPantsModule using the babel package manager codepre  pIn fact, rather than a simple error message I would like to make some modules optional, so that compilation still proceeds ahead, maybe with reduced functionality. Is this possiblep  pstrongSOLUTION EDITstrong Based on the answer here is my version how to solve the issue, first you need a codemoduleCheckercode binary with the following sourcep  precodeimport os, osproc  let tmpFile  getTempDir  dynamicModuleChecker.nim  proc checkModulemodule string    except     echo Cannot write , tmpFile,  to check the availability of modules     quit1   writeFiletmpFile, import  amp module amp n    finally removeFiletmpFile    except     echoCannot run nimrod check to check the availability of modules     quit1   if execCmdExnimrod check  amp tmpFile.exitCode  0     echoCannot import module  amp module amp .     quit1   else     echo OK  if ParamCount lt 1   quitPass as first parameter the module to check else   checkModuleParamStr1 codepre  pThen, having this command available the following macro can be usedp  precodeimport macros  macro safeImportmodule, message string stmt    if OK  gorge.moduleChecker  amp module.strVal     result  newNimNodennkStmtList.add       newNimNodennkImportStmt.add       newIdentNodemodule.strVal   else     errornModule  amp module.strVal amp        not available.n amp message.strVal  safeImportgenieos,   Please install httpgradha.github.iogenieos codepre  pIt is too unfortunate that a separate process has to be spawned, not only for the external compilation but also another one to generate the temporary file to check, as there is no codestaticWritecode in the current version to generate files at compile time.p

Negative 63960 pIm having trouble making my site function well both in JS, and emwithoutem JS.p  pI have two standalone versions working just fine. Now, I have a photoalbum. In the Javascript version, there is a a hrefhttpfancyapps.comfancybox relnofollowFancyBoxa. Theres the overview of all photos inside an album, and clicking an image will open up that image in FancyBox. In decent browsers, the url even changes with the codeIDcode of the image, so you can share an image easily. When the Javascript version is called with an image, the FancyBox gets loaded automatically.p  pThe issue is with the codenon JS versioncode. Here we have the same overview of all the images in the album, but the links are different. To solve this, I use the following scriptp  pcodeltnoscriptgtlt all the images here gtltnoscriptgtcodep  pfor the nonJS version, andp  pcodeltdiv classjsonlygtlt all the images here gtltdivgtcode withp  pcodeltnoscriptgtltstylegt.jsonlydisplaynoneltstylegtltnoscriptgtcodep  pNow the strongissue is that Id rather not have the whole jsversion in the background of the phpversion, because this is a rather biggy and also requires two extra queriesstrong. To try and circumvent these troubles, I used JS to set a cookie if JS is enabled, so I could filter it out in PHP. The issue with this however is, that when a user had JS enabled and suddenly doesnt anymore, it will still present the JSversion because of the cookie thats still there.p  pWhat are common solutions for problems like these Should I just put it all in the background, or neglect the fact that some people might need to push a button to go back to the JS versionp
Negative 63960 pIm currently working on a GUI interface that runs a a hrefhttpgnuradio.org relnofollowGNU Radioa script rendering some Qt windows plotting real time histogramm, waterfall graph, or other nice gui.... I control its parameters and launch it from my first main windows. Id like to integrate the QApp created by launching the GNU Radio script inside a widget of my first main windows which is another QApp.p  pI already tried to run a second QApp in the same time of my first one, for some reasons, I get errors like codeQCoreApplicationsendPostedEvents Cannot send posted events for objects in another threadcode.p  pI did not work around this error because a nicer idea would be to have a kind of container whom I would give a codePyQt4.QtGui.QApplicationcode object to make him execute and display it without creating a second windows.p  pDoes that kind of container exist p  pThanks a lot  p
