Positive 16 pIm making a platform game which is mostly based on recreate the very first Super Mario Bros.p  pFor now what I need is to know when the player object stops colliding with a wall object. I know when it does collide, for example when player.rect.bottom  wall.rect.top then Floor state  1. How can I make Floor state  0 which would make he fall if player is no longer colliding.p  pI already tried by using p  precodeif player.rect.bottomleft   wall.rect.topright or player.rect.bottomright  wall.rect.topleft         Floor  1 codepre  pThat makes the player fall if its in the corner. But if the player has an acceleration, it wont pass through this point, Floor will still be Floor  1 and the player wont fall, hell be afloat or flying. Thanksp  pIs there anyway to know when it stops colliding, which would allow me to change Floors valuep
