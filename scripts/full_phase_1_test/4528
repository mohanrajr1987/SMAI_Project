Positive 4528 pI have a solution with three projects p  ol liA web application WAli liA Data Model Layer DML using code first, and li liA Data Access Layer DALli ol  pThe WAs codeweb.configcode and the DMLs codeapp.configcode each have a connection string section specifying a connection string for the database. p  pIve noticed that the DML connection string doesnt really matter. So is it safe to completely remove this section from the codeapp.configcode file p  pAlso, why is this string unused Finally, Im guessing when the application is run, the connection to the database is established using the connection string in the codeweb.configcode file and the database definition is managed by the DMLDAL p  pIs this because the other projects arent really being run per se, just the methods and properties are being referenced Thanksp
