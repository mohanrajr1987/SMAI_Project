Positive 9378 pIm working on a legacy JavaSwing application and ran into a problemp  pThe main GUIcomponent in this application is a Gantt chart, that displays tasks, as rectangles with a label, basically. A rightclick on a task opens a contextmenu, while hovering over a task with the mouse will show a customized, scrollable JTooltip. This constellation leads to my problem.p  pIf I position the tooltip too far away from the current mouse position, the tooltip disappears, before I can move the mouse to one of the scrollbar handles horizontalvertical. If I position the tooltip too near to the current mouse position, the context menu wont open anymore, because the tooltip hides the underlying task and the rightclick is therefore captured by the tooltip and not the task.p  pWhat Ive tried so farp  ul lisearched for some kind of delay in ToolTipManager, to control how long the tooltip is shown, after the mouse leaves the control, which triggered the tooltip to be shown. As far as I can say, there is no such delayproperty.li litried to find the right distance between tooltip and current mouse position, so that the scrollbar handles of the tooltip can be reached and the contextmenu is also shown.  I found some distance, where both works, but often you have to try several times, until one can reach the scrollbar handles.li ul  pSo my question is Is there any way to control when a JToolTip is hidden after the mouse leaves the corresponding componentp

Negative 9378 pIm building a website where users can create an account and add RSS feeds to their personalized user page. Users can rearrange their feed order using a web form. But I would prefer it if they could organize their feeds using some kind of ajax folder tree, like Google Reader.p  pIn case you arent familiar with the Google Reader interface, here is a screenshot  a hrefhttpgoo.glTkG6m relnofollowhttpgoo.glTkG6map  pCurrently my tables are set up like this...p  pUSERSp  puserid  username  emailaddress  passwordp  pFEEDSp  pfeedid  feedname  feedurl  feedorder  feedownerp  pI wont go into too much detail. But, basically, the value of feedowner corresponds with a particular userid. The feedorder determines what order the feeds will be displayed on the user page  by default they have no value until a user assigns one so theyre just displayed alphabetically.p  pI have no idea where to go from here. p  pIm not looking for some magic tutorial although, Id be thrilled if there is one. I just need some help figuring a plan of attack for implementing this Google Readerlike folder tree user feeds.p

While the export succeeds, the plugin itself doesnt work and it does work when I run the project.p
