Positive 456 pBy mistake, Ive recently deleted a branch into a clone that Ive forked on GitHub. After noticing this error, Ive tried to reactivate this branch, but Ive realized that this action seemed to create a pull request into the upstream repository. Therefore, Ive decided to definitely delete this branch into my clone, in order strongto not affectstrong the upstream source in any way.p  pAfter this misadventure, I have some questions about management of branches into a GitHub clonep  ol lican I safely delete a branch in my clone especially if this branch seems no longer active in upstreamli liis it possible to fully synchronize all the branches emdefaultem, emactiveem and emstaleem branches from upstream into my cloneli liis it better to keep only a unique emmasterem branch into my clone in particular if my goal is mainly to stay updated from upstreamli lican I create a specific branch into my clone without affecting upstream in any way as automated pull requestli ol
Positive 456 pHard to describe what happens accurately. p  pBasically, I have 2 localremote branch codeAcode and codeBcode codeBcode deriving from codeAcode and ahead of it.p  pI made some works on codeBcode, and committed them.  Thinking my commit was successful, I immediately ran  codegit checkout Acodep  pBut it didnt place codeHEADcode on codeAcode. p  pIndeed, I discovered some errors within the logs during the commit that I didnt notice at time  p  pcodeunable to unlink files, permission deniedcode for many files.br Solution was to give some permissions through codechmodcode command.p  pThe issue is that I ended up with a very very curious behavior  I lost my changes on codeBcode  p  pstrongIs it possible that the command git checkout A, while having some errors, acts as if it means get all codeAcodes files and replace over codeBcode files, instead of MOVING from B branch to A branch, explaining why I got stale files from last codeAcode commit in codeBcode.strong p  pQuestion is Despite my lack of accuracy on the issue and the exact steps, what might be the issue causing codeBcode to revert all its changes ...p  pSorry if it isnt an OP very robust, but it would ensure me if someone tells me Oh I know what youve got, I already had this strange issue... p  pThis OP is clearly about figuring out what happened.p

Positive 456 pI have a git project with a messy history, where branches with the same commits and different commit ids were merged and would like to clean it up.p  pWhat happenedp  ul linormal git workflow.li lithen I saw some older commits having the wrong author information missing user.name setting and rebased it.li licodegit push forcecode. bad ideali lithe next user merged his branch with his new commit into this branch. I should have told everyone to do a fresh cloneli liI did not see the problem, and we continued to commit like normal. Some feature and releasebranches were used after the mergeli ul  pThe resultp  pThere is a long timeline of commits on two different branches, which are absolutely identical and only differ, because their parent hash is different. Its not only unclean, but makes it harder to work with old commits I guess git bisect would be a total mess and the tree now still contains the bogus commits, which should have been rebased, too.p  pHow can this be cleaned up, assuming that now everyone participating will NOT merge an old tree againp
Positive 456 pI have a working SVN repository CollabNet Subversion Edge 4.0.11  on Windows 2012 R2 with 62200 or so revs.  I am moving it to a Linux RedHat 6.6 CollabNet version 1.8.13 with Apache2.2.29. I understand the best way to migrate is to dump the repository. So I ran the following dump command p  precodesvnadmin dump r 162268 Fcsvndatarepositoriesrepos gt GMyDump.dump codepre  pWhen I try to dump the windows repository I get an error at revision 4255 p  blockquote   psvnadmin E200002 Serialized hash malformed.p blockquote  pNext I run just after that point another dump cause I think I can sort that out by merging the adjacent revisions into the corrupted one so I run the following commandp  precodesvnadmin dump r 425762268 Fcsvndatarepositoriesrepos gt GMy2dump.dump codepre  pThis comes up with a new error at revision 16153 that has me puzzled p  blockquote   psvnadmin E140001 zlib uncompress corrupt data Decompression of   svndiff data failedp blockquote  pThen when I run a third dump, as I am a glutton or punishment. I use the following commandp  precodesvnadmin dump r 1615462268 Fcsvndatarepositoriesrepos gt GMy3dump.dump codepre  pBut it simply hangs and seems to be doing nothing. This repository goes back 10 years and only the past 6 years is relevant. Can I somehow modify the dump to extract the past X number of years or revisions from the present that are not corrupt and load that into the new Repository So I would dump starting from the present and go backwards so to speak just a thought I dont have any good backups as those servers and tapes are gone with the last company move.

Positive 456 pI have the following GIT branching model in my mindp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com1bMj1.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com1bMj1.png altcustomized GIT model with longer living hotfix branchap  pWe have a emdevelopem, emmasterem and emhotfix1.0em branch. All are public available. The emhotfix1.0em branch is derived from the master and should only get closed if a new major version comes out. The reason for that is to use continous integration and to be able to create nightly builds from it. The local hotfix branches emissue50em, emissue51em are also derived from emmasterem to assure that the latest updates from emmasterem are included.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comHAomV.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHAomV.png althow the next hotfix branch gets createdap  pIf a hotfix has to be made, a local branch is created e.g. emissue51em. The emissue51em branch should be merged into emhotfix1.0em branch to maintain the context which issue was finished. Therefore I thought to use codegit merge noffcode. Is this a good idea Now when a certain collection of issues has finished e.g. for the release 1.1 the emhotfix1.0em  branch should be merged into master and develop.p  pNow you have the option of codegit rebasecode and codegit mergecode. What will be the more clever way for the merging of a the local hotfix branches into emhotfix1.0em and b the merging of the emhotfix1.0em branch into emmasterem  emdevelopemp  pAlso if you use rebase Do you first rebase the emhotfix1.0em branch onto emmasterem and at the same time to emdevelopem Will that work by finding the common parent and applying the diffp
