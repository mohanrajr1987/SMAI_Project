Negative 16957 pIm a newbie to TCPClient, Im trying to make a webcam app that sends small images 4kb each to another IP which will run an identical program. So its going to send and receive at the same time.p  pProblem I have is the tcpOut disconnects after one send which means I only see one frame. In the code below there are two sections, first the NewFrameReceived is run on every new image from the camera, which is then sent, the other method is the receive method which puts the received pic into a picture box at the moment my own from 127.0.0.1 p  precodeprivate void fChatLoadobject sender, EventArgs e      fire up listener    listeningThread.RunWorkerAsync      tcp server setup    tcpOut  new TcpClient    tcpOut.Connect127.0.0.1, 54321        private void NewFrameReceivedobject sender, NewFrameEventArgs e              Bitmap img  Bitmape.Frame.Clone          byte[] imgBytes  EncodeToJpegimg, 25.ToArray         if tcpOut.Connected lt PROBLEM HERE, THIS IS FALSE ON 2ND ITERATION                      using NetworkStream ns  tcpOut.GetStream                              if ns.CanWrite                                      ns.WriteBitConverter.GetBytesimgBytes.Length, 0, 4                     ns.WriteimgBytes, 0, imgBytes.Length                                                   private void listeningThreadDoWorkobject sender, System.ComponentModel.DoWorkEventArgs e               start listening for connections         tcpIn  new TcpListenerIPAddress.Any, 54321         tcpIn.Start          while true                      using TcpClient inClient  tcpIn.AcceptTcpClient  blocks until connected                              using NetworkStream stream  inClient.GetStream                                      Byte[] imgSizeBytes  new Byte[4]                     stream.ReadimgSizeBytes, 0, 4                     int imgSize  BitConverter.ToInt32imgSizeBytes, 0                     Byte[] imgBytes  new Byte[imgSize]                     stream.ReadimgBytes, 0, imgSize                     MemoryStream ms  new MemoryStreamimgBytes                     Image img  Image.FromStreamms                     picVideo.Image  img                                             codepre  pMany thanks in advance.p

Negative 16957 pI currently have a form for a nested resource in one of my activeadmin pagesp  precode    f.inputs Courses do       f.hasmany registrations, allowdestroy gt true, newrecord true do tc         tc.input course         tc.input semester       end     end codepre  pThis is for a strongstudentstrong resource.  A strongstudentstrong has many strongcourseofferingsstrong through strongregistrationsstrong.  However, I didnt want users to select the strongcourseofferingstrong directly from a menu Since there will be many repeats of the same course each year.  Instead there is an input for strongcoursestrong and strongsemesterstrong.  strongcoursestrong and strongsemesterstrong are instance variables on the strongregistrationstrong model.  They are set in the form, then the correct strongcourseofferingstrong is found in an after save hook and associated with the strongregistrationstrong.  The code is as followsp  precodedef semesters   semester  s.toi end  def semester   self.courseoffering.semester end  def courseco   course  co.toi end  def course   self.courseoffering.course end  beforesave setcourseoffering  def setcourseoffering   self.courseoffering  CourseOffering.wheresemesterid semester, courseid course.first   TODO Handle case where no course offering is found end codepre  pI am having two problems.  The first is that I get a nil pointer error when registrations table is empty.p  blockquote   pundefined method course for nilNilClassp blockquote  pI have acceptsnestedattributes call in my strongstudentstrong model.p  precodeacceptsnestedattributesfor registrations, allowdestroy gt true codepre  pwhich is the only suggestion I get when looking up the error but still get it despite having that piece of code.  It seems to work fine when I remove the strongcoursestrong and strongsemesterstrong and replace it with a strongcourseofferingstrong instead.p  pThe next problem I have is that the student record does not save after hitting update.  I assume this is because I dont make any changes that write to the database when I only update the two strongcoursestrong and strongsemesterstrong instance variables only.  I either need to update another input or add the call to the semester method.p
Negative 16957 pMy chrome extension is recognising a specific tabs URL, and then, on icon click, it modifies that active tabs content.  I would like to gauge the usage of it, in some way. This is the extensions logicp  precode manifest.json [injecting jquery amp jquery plugin]  background.js [ on extensions icon click, it executes contentscript.js and tracking.js]  icon  contentscript.js [ it modifies page content ]  tracking.js GA code, as provided by google Analytics then modified according to httpsdavidsimpson.me20140527addgooglesuniversalanalyticstrackingchromeextension  codepre  hr  pI would like to see how many times extensions button is clicked. I tried adding the appropriate permissions to manifest.jsonp  precode  contentsecuritypolicy scriptsrc self httpswww.googleanalytics.com objectsrc self codepre  pand adding Analytics code to a separate .js file tracking.js, and executing it when the extensions icon is clicked, as specified in background.js belowp  precodechrome.browserAction.onCLicked.addListener functiontab  chrome.tabs.executeScriptnull, file contentscript.js chrome.tabs.executeScriptnull, file tracking.js  codepre  p.. it doesnt work, in the sense that Google Analytics is telling me tracking not installed, and I cannot think of another way of adding it.p  pHow can I see this extensions usagep
Negative 16957 pThere are many posts about this but I couldnt find one working correctly For Example below code works but it deletes the first line.p  pI want to insert some text at the beginning of a file without deleting anything, just an insert.
