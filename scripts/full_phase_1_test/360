Positive 360 pI have 2 different date.year parameters on 2 different datasets. The datasets are Identical to eachother. This enables me to compare the same 2 columns from different years in one table. The problem is that whenever the parameters are multivalued they seem to effect the values of the rows I want to compare to eachother. The table generally seems inconsistant when switching around the parameters.br p  pThese records are finebr  a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comgZjqW.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comgZjqW.png altenter image description hereap  pThis is the problem br  a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comtk3Ej.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comtk3Ej.png altenter image description hereap

Positive 360 pI have created forms that will allow the user to dictate the constraints of a query i.e. student attendance for their state versus another state with the use of ComboBoxes. The problem arises when I add multiple constraints to the query. I have had intermittent success with 2 categories but it seems only consistent with 1 category. I need three categories but I have had no success getting all three categories to work on the same form.  However, all categories work by themselves if run independently removing some constraints from query. So, I know that the ComboBoxes on my form work properly. It seems the problem is with the querys SQL.p  precodeSELECT  StudentsAllClasses.LastName, StudentsAllClasses.FirstName,      StudentsAllClasses.[Class Name], StudentsAllClasses.State,      StudentsAllClasses.ClassDate FROM StudentsAllClasses WHERE      StudentsAllClasses.[Class Name][Forms][User Input][ComboClass]     AND      StudentsAllClasses.State[Forms][User Input][ComboState] AND      StudentsAllClasses.ClassDate[Forms][User Input][ComboDate] codepre  pI think the problem is with the AND operator in the where statement.  If I change it to OR I can use all three constraints. But, I need the constraints to be cumulative so it it catagory x AND category y AND category Z. Any help would be appreciatedp  pThanksp

Positive 360 pI am new to MDX and am trying to write some custom code to get the parameter drop downs in my SSRS report to be the way they are required. p  pI wrote one query that works and it feeds the data for a parameter I have. This is confirmed working. Now that I have that parameter, I want to write another query for another parameter, where I will use the values from the first parameter to filter the second. So when the user chooses one or more of the options from the drop down, then the result of the second parameter will be filtered based on the user selection.p  pIve written the following code and I cannot see why it is not working. p  precodeWITH  MEMBER [Measures].[ParameterValue] AS        [Agent].[Department].CURRENTMEMBER.UNIQUENAME  SELECT         [Measures].[ParameterValue]  ON COLUMNS,  Descendants        [Agent].[Department].[Enterprise Group]  ON ROWS  FROM          SELECT                      STRTOSETBU, CONSTRAINED         ON COLUMNS  FROM [State Perspective]  codepre  pBU is my first parameter. I would expect the query to filter based on it but it does not. p  pWhen I first tried to close Query Designer I got the following errorp  blockquote   pThe Query contains the BU parameter, which is not declared. p blockquote  pSo I rightclicked the data grid area and set up the parameter and value point to some example data in the cube. This fixed that issue and I was able to click OK on the Query Designer. p  pBut the query does not filter as needed. Instead all results are returned instead of filtered values. p  pWhat am I doing wrong here, or can this even be done, to filter another parameter based on the values in a previous parameterp  pIve done this in regular SQL with SSRS and it works just fine. But how is it done with a Cube and MDXp

Negative 360 pI have a problem with .Nets a hrefhttpmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.windows.forms.richtextbox28VS.8029.aspx relnofollowRichTextBoxa control. It seems that it doesnt support table cell formatting, which is funny because most of the time I create tables I want the cell contents to be rightaligned numbers, currency. p  pIf I try to open a WordPad document in RichTextBox, it ignores and actually strongremovesstrong the commands for cell alignment. I tried several workarounds but didnt succeed.p  ol lipCan anyone think of an idea to fix this without using fixedwidth fonts and spaces This would be the best solution since other code is working fine already, so if only thing needed is a dirty hack, it would be great.pli lipOr is there an open source alternative for .Net Rich Text Editor you can recommend I need a user control I can embed in my Windows form and access the contents programmatically create content, or append something. I have searched the web for some time but found only web AjaxJavascript controls.pli lipThere are also HTML WYSIWYG editors which I could use, but they are all basically a IE browser embedded and edited using MSHTML, and it feels a bit strange to have that in a Winforms app maybe I am wrong. And in that case we will need some extra time to implement a content generator for HTML  although its much easier to read and generate than RTF IMHO.pli lipWhat do you guys find best for this purposepli ol
