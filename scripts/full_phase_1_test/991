Positive 991 pIm studying SICP, and ex1.20 gives the following codep  precode    define gcd a b       if  b 0         a         gcd b remainder a b codepre  pThe question asks about the times remainder is called when we run codegcd 206 40code in applicative order and normal order, respectively. I can figure out remainder is called 4 times in applicative order, but I cant understand why it becomes 18 when it comes to normal order. In my view, first codegcd 40 remainder 206 40codeis called, and next we need to calculate coderemainder 206 40code, which is 6, if we want to know which branch we go to, and then coderemainder 40 6code, and so on, and it turns out to be 4 times, too. But the answer gives the following processp  precode     gcd 206 40        if  40 0 ...        gcd 40 remainder 206 40        if  remainder 206 40 0 ...        if  6 0 ...        gcd remainder 206 40 remainder 40 remainder 206 40        if  remainder 40 remainder 206 40 0 ...        if  4 0 ...        gcd remainder 40 remainder 206 40 remainder remainder 206 40 remainder 40 remainder 206 40        if  remainder remainder 206 40 remainder 40 remainder 206 40 0 ...        if  2 0 ...        gcd remainder remainder 206 40 remainder 40 remainder 206 40 remainder remainder 40 remainder 206 40 remainder remainder 206 40 remainder 40 remainder 206 40        if  remainder remainder 40 remainder 206 40 remainder remainder 206 40 remainder 40 remainder 206 40 0 ...        if  0 0 ...       remainder remainder 206 40 remainder 40 remainder 206 40  codepre  pSo in total its 18 times. I think the main difference between the two answers is that I think once a remainder is calculated, then it wont need to be calculated any more, but the answer might seem to calculate it every time. Is this a matter of compiler Isnt this too efficientlessp
Positive 991 pI am trying to learn LispScheme and I tried implementing a very simple version of the mandelbrot set in it to get practice. The problem I ran into is that the code runs very, very slow. At first I thought it was because I was using recursion instead of imperative loops, but I tried rewriting more or less the same code recursion included in python which doesnt even have tailcall optimisation, and it ran very smoothp  pSo I am wondering if there is something obvious I am missing in my code and what I could do to make it run faster.p  pHere is the code snippet in Scheme racket. I also did pretty much the same thing in SBCL and the speed was comparablep  precodelang racket  definesyntax dotimes     syntaxrules         var n res . body        do limit n             var 0  var 1            gt var limit res          . body        var n . body        do limit n             var 0  var 1            gt var limit          . body  define printbrot zr zc   if lt   zr zr  zc zc 2       display        display .  define brot zr zc cr cc i   if  i 0       printbrot zr zc       let z2r   zr zr  zc zc z2c  2 zr zc         brot  z2r cr  z2c cc cr cc  i 1  define linspace i w     i  w 2  w 4  define brotgrid w h n   dotimes i w            dotimes j h                     let x linspace i w y linspace j h                       brot 0 0 x y n            newline  brotgrid 40 80 20 codepre  pI hope the code block is not too clustery, it was hard to strip it to something more simplep  pAlso, I know Scheme and Common Lisp have complex numbers built in but I wanted to test it using regular real numbers, I dont think this is the reason it runs so slow.p  pThe parameter i of the brot function is the number of iterations, and the parameter n of brotgrid is also the number of iterations to use for each point. When I set it to more than like 10, the code takes forever to run, which doesnt seem normal. The increase in time taken also doesnt seem to be linear, for instance it only takes about a second on my machine with n  10 but takes several minutes with n  15 and doesnt even finish with n  20p  pSo, what is it that makes this code run so slowp  pThanks in advancep

Positive 991 pIf I try to evaluate the expression codeexpt 123456 123456code in both Chicken Scheme with the numbers extension and Clisp it takes quite a long time more in Clisp. So I thought that evaluating the expression code expt 123456 123456 expt 123456 123456code would take at least double that time, because the interpreter has to evaluate twice the power function and then has to evaluate a division.

Positive 991 pI have a list of primes stored in a variable codeprimeslistsplitcode that are represented in a list format by a codenumbergtlistcode method. The format is as follows the prime list of 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11 would be code2 3 5 7 1 1code.p  pcodegetprimepairscode takes as input this list, and tries to find every combination that concatenates to another prime. Then it should return these pairs in a list in the list representation. So the pair 3 367 which concatenates to 3367 which is also prime should be in the list in the representation 3 3 6 7. p  pTo achieve this my idea was to walk over the list and for every prime represented as a list concatenate it with all other primes represented as lists.

Positive 991 pIm working with the Racket macro extension codesyntaxidrulescode, that some other Scheme implementations provide under the name codeidentifiersyntaxcode. These let you specify macro expansions that will happen even when the defined identifier isnt in head position. So for examplep  precodedefine hidden f definesyntax proxy   syntaxidrules set     [set proxy v set hidden v]     [proxy hidden] codepre  pwill set up the identifier codeproxycode to be a proxy for codehiddencode. This is a useless example, but it illustrates the usage.p  pI find myself in a situation where I want a global ordinary macro, lets call it codefoocode, that I want to override in some cases where Im using an identifier macro like codeproxycode. That is, I want to be able to do something like thisp  precodedefinesyntax foo   syntaxrules      [foo arg ... default]  define hidden f definesyntax proxy   syntaxidrules foo set     [foo proxy arg ... special]     [set proxy v set hidden v]     [proxy hidden]  foo proxy  should return special codepre  pBut in fact the last line returns codedefaultcode, because the codefoocode macro gets expanded before the codeproxycode one.p  pAny ideas how I might achieve something along these lines, but with the codeproxycode identifier macro overriding the default macro definition for codefoocode Im not committed to the above architecture specifically.p  pAdded This isnt for any realworld usage, but part of a demonstration of a theoretical point in formal semantics.p
