Positive 38 pIm trying to get an old Flex project up and running.  It was written by someone else, in Flash Builder.  Ive imported it into FDT.p  pIve noticed that all my MXML image links are all broken.p  pI thought I could remedy this by adding the assets directory to the package contents.  Project Properties  FDT AIR Properties  Desktop ... added the assets directory  But it didnt help.p  pI found a workaround.  I simply sayp  precodeltmxImage sourceEmbedassetspicture.png codepre  pInstead ofp  precodeltmxImage sourceassetspicture.png codepre  pI also tried assets, srcassets, ..assets, ..assets etc... by the way, assets is a subdirectory of srcp  pBut Im curious why adding the assets directory to the package didnt work.  And given that the project must have worked before asis  Id like to make it work for me, without modification.p

I check the codebincode directory for codeYCanvasLibrarycode  nothing there.li ol  pIve tried to build codeYCanvasLibrarycode directly. Did a clean and then build but still no .swc.p  pAm I missing a step or a setting I cant tell if I am doing something wrong or if the YCanvas project is assuming I know something that I dont, or it is set up badly. There are no docs at all.p  pstrongSo the question isstrong How do I force the codeYCanvasLibrarycode to get built It is not getting built when I try to build the ApplicationMap app which links to it, or when I try to build it directly.p  pThis is what the Flash Builder workspace directory looks like.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com65qwa.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com65qwa.png altenter image description hereap

Using the RXTXlibrary   rxtx.qbang.org, one connection per instance of this class can be handled.   In addition to handling a connection, information about the available Serial   ports can be received using this class.      A separate link Thread is started to handle messages that are being   received over the Serial interface.      This class also makes packages out of a stream of bytes received, using a   link divider, and sending these packages as an array of ltbgtintltbgts each   between 0 and 255 to a function implemented by a class implementing the   link net.Networkifaceinterface.      author Raphael Blatter raphaelblatter.sg   author heavily using code examples from the RXTXwebsite rxtx.qbang.org   public class Network      private InputStream inputStream     private OutputStream outputStream            The status of the connection.           private boolean connected  false            The Thread used to receive the data from the Serial interface.           private Thread reader     private SerialPort serialPort            Communicating between threads, showing the link reader when the       connection has been closed, so it can link Threadjoin.           private boolean end  false             Link to the instance of the class implementing link net.Networkiface.           private Networkiface contact            A small ltbgtintltbgt representing the number to be used to distinguish       between two consecutive packages.

Depending on the other side of the       Serial port, it might be easier to send using a String. Note this method       does not add the link divider to the end.              If a connection is open, a link String can be sent over the Serial       port using this function. If no connection is available, ltbgtfalseltbgt is       returned and a message is sent using       link net.NetworkifacewriteLogint, String.              param message                  The link String to be sent over the Serial connection.       return ltbgttrueltbgt if the message could be sent, ltbgtfalseltbgt otherwise.           public boolean writeSerialString message          boolean success  false         if isConnected              try                  outputStream.writemessage.getBytes                 success  true              catch IOException e                  disconnect                       else              contact.writeLogid, No port is connected.                  return success                  If a connection is open, an ltbgtintltbgt between 0 and 255 except the       link net.Networkdivider can be sent over the Serial port using this       function. The message will be finished by sending the       link net.Networkdivider.

Negative 38 pI currently use SVN for my projects though I will be trying git out soon and I know most of the basics committing, updating, branching, merging etc though I feel Im still a bit ignorant on how to properly use it. By the way, my projects only currently involve myself.p  pHeres an example scenario we have the SVN server, the live web server, the devtest web server and my workstation. I create a new feature involving multiple new files and commit it with the message created new feature X, once checked out on the dev server I go through the cycle of seeing an error, fixing the error, committing, checking out, repeat until all the errors are gone. Some of those error fixes may have been simple typos.p  pSo Im slightly confused because the main feature commit seems to be on par with the tiny typo fixing commits if that makes sense, when I see a list of versions I probably just want to see the main changes and not minor fixes. Also, the meaningful commit message may take 10 times longer to type out then the actual error fix so more often then not I just leave it blank or type er. This doesnt seem quite right. So what am I missing Or am I just being lazyp
