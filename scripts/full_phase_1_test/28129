Positive 28129 pI am working on a simple iPhone app for a notforprofit organization that I do some work for.  Ive done extensive testing on the various emulators, and I think that the app is ready to go.  I was reading about the process to get an app on the App Store and part of the process seems to indicate that I need to register an iOS device in Xcode as part of the process.  I do not own an iPhone, and my only iOS device is an iPad Air 2.  This is not a universal app.p  pIs it even possible for me to put the app on the App Store  Im just checking because I want to be certain that I can accomplish my goal, before shelling out the 99 for a developer membership.p

Positive 28129 pWe prompt users to upgrade their app if theyre running an outdated version. When users tap our update button, I use openURL with an address like codeitmsitunes.apple.comusappourapptitleid12345mt8code to load the App Store app to the listing for our app. p  pWith that method, however, the resulting screen has a button labeled Open not Update. If users open the App Store app first, then navigate to our apps listing or go to the update tab, the button is labeled Update.p  pCan I pass the current version as a querystring parameter in the openURL call or is there another way to make sure the Update button is shown I cannot find current documentation on how to do so. Everything I find is a few years old and refers to the discontinued phobos tool.p
Positive 28129 pIm about to release a game, and Ive decided the cutoff for performance and aspect ratio reasons is the iphone 5 on the bottom end. So no iphone 4s.p  pThe only way to restrict devices is by using combinations of requirements in the UIRequredDeviceCapabilities key of info.plist.p  pRequiring armv7s restricts the right devices, based on this toolp  pa hrefhttp28byteslater.comioscompatibilityexcludeamprequire9chart relnofollowhttp28byteslater.comioscompatibilityexcludeamprequire9chartap  pBUT... there are conflicting reports on whether this is will work, and be accepted by the app store. Some articles say that if you require armv7s you HAVE to require armv7 as well. Does anyone actually tried submitting an app with an armv7s requirement to prevent iphone 4s downloadsp
Positive 28129 pIm trying to validate an iOS application but every time I get rejected  with the same response  During review, your app failed to launch on iPhone running iOS 8.4.1 on both WiFi and cellular networks. Specifically, when we selected the application on the Home screen, the app displayed a launch image then quit unexpectedly. This may be because iOS 8 uses a watchdog timer for applications if an application takes too long to complete its initial startup, the operating system terminates the application. the function appDelegatedidFinishLaunching lunch only the main Viewcontroller. I really need your help p
Positive 28129 pI just recently submitted my third app to the app store  I have never been asked for a video to demonstrate the functionality of the app. Is this a new requirement Also, would recording the app functionality on Quicktime connected to my device suffice to meet this requirement p  pI am sure they get thousands of apps, but I even provided an intro tutorial about the app works  which would be faster than watching a full demo video.

Negative 28129 pThe test program below creates a host thread for each GPU. Each host thread creates a cuFFT plan and executes the FFT.p  pMost of the time, the program seems to run without error. However, sometimes it fails in a variety of ways see below for example outputs. Does anybody have any idea why this program fails sometimesp  pIm running this program on a machine that has two Intel Xeon E5620 CPUs, 48 GB of host memory, and four Tesla C2075 cards, none of which are being used for display. The operating system is Linux Debian 7.4, and I have CUDA version 5.5 installed. The NVIDIA driver version is 319.82. For reference, error codes 4 and 11 from cuFFT are CUFFTINVALIDVALUE and CUFFTINVALIDDEVICE respectively.p  pstrongUpdatestrong I am becoming more suspicious that the cuFFT is not thread safe, as the documentation seems to claim. If I protect the whole thread with a mutex i.e., only one thread can actually execute at a time, the program does not fail. Protecting only the cufftPlan1d call or only the cufftExecR2C call with a mutex results in the program failing.
