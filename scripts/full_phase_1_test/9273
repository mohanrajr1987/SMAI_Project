Positive 9273 pI have a class library named WebAccounts.dll that calls some of my own WCF web services. I have the web services project automatically build a client version of its data contracts for consumption by its .net clients. It builds both a .net 3.5 and 4.0 version. So I havep  precodeOMWebServices.dll OMWebServices.ClientDataContracts35.dll OMWebServices.ClientDataContracts.dll .net 4.0 version codepre  pAs part of a new website we are building, Ive upgraded WebAccounts.dll from .net 3.5 to 4.5. So I also updated its ClientDataContracts reference from the 3.5 version, to the 4.0 version just because it could now use it.p  pNow when WebAccounts tries to call a service method, I get a MethodAccessExceptionp  blockquote   pAttempt by method WebAccounts.Data.Franchise..ctorSystem.String,   IdentifierType to access method WebAccounts.OMConfigService.ConfigurationServiceClient.GetFranchiseSystem.String,   OMSServices.DataContracts.FranchiseIDType, Boolean failed.p blockquote  pIf I change back to ClientDataContracts35, it works successfully. It is bewildering that changing my data contract assembly version affects whether or not my code can access the generated proxy method which is not in the ClientDataContacts assembly, and is public.p  pIve stumbled onto a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14689305serializationbreaksinnet45this Questiona, which says that you can add codeltxmlSerializer useLegacySerializerGenerationtruegtcode to the web.config to fix some kind of .net 4.5 serialization compatibility issue. I gave it a shot and it fixes it when using the 4.0 ClientDataContracts. But whyp  pOne last twist is if I skip using WebAccounts in my website project and just add a service reference and call the same service directly, it works even with the 4.0 ClientDataContracts without needing to add the useLegacySerializerGeneration configuration. So using ClientDataContracts 4.0, the website can call the web service directly, but calling WebAccounts which calls the same web service gets the exception. Ive also verified WebAccounts gets the exception when called from a test project to rule out anything specific to the website project.p  pCan anyone explain whats going on herep

Positive 9273 pI know this must be straight forward but somehow I am not able to get my head around it.p  p Scenario p  pWe are using a system which has a WPF front end, then a DB first entity framework and then a SQL 2008R2 database.p  pmost of the entities that we have are parent child relations. A parent cannot exist without children and hence the stored procedures that we have take p  pParent Data and list of child data, here list of child data is passed as XML after serializing the entire list using XML Serializer.p  pAll this was working fine until we have to save 500,000 child records. when we try to do this XML Serializer fails complaining about out of memory. Then I tried to send child records in batches of 10,000 which executes the query and saves the data but atomicity is then lost coz its just a for loop like this..p  precode For Each batchList In groups.Split10000      Dim serializer As New XmlListSerializerOf someObjectbatchList.ToList, Data      Dim xml  serializer.ToXmlString      efContext.AddDataCTypeaddedParentId.Value, Short, xml, DatasomeObject  Next codepre  pWhere add data is function import mapped to stored procedure.p  p Question p  pNow my question here is, what is the right way to add multiple child records into database while keeping the atomicity of the operation active.p  pAlso, the above mentioned way is dead slow, for hald million recortds it takes 5 minutes which is not acceptable anyway.p

Negative 9273 pIm trying to construct a social network graph of twitter users who have mentioned a particular topic.  My strategy to do this goes roughly like thisp  ol liQuery twitter for a topic.  Collect the first 100 tweets that come up and add those users to the graph.li liFor each userli liRetrieve friends and followers.li liQuery each friendfollower for the topic.  If they turn up a result meaning theyve discussed the topic, add them to the graph.li liFor each user that was added to the graph, return to step 2 until the desired search depth is reached.li ol  pMy problem is twofold.  First of all, this approach quickly exceeds my search API rate limit.    Even with a search depth of 2, its quite likely that Ill find people with 100 friendsfollowers and I am unable to query them all before hitting the rate limit.p  pSecondly, this all takes quite awhile.  Twitter API is not fast.  In the hypothetical event that I was not rate limited, I could submit the requests asynchronously, but I cant help wondering if there is a more efficient way.p  pIve tried aggregating the requests into one query per search depth topic AND fromname1 OR fromname2 .... OR fromnameip  pThis basically explodes.  I get a connection reset error from the twitter API.  If I copy the query into the twitter web page, it just sits for awhile and then says loading tweets seems to be taking awhile.  p  pI also emailed apitwitter.com to ask for suggestions  access increase, but no response so far.p  pIf anyone has any suggestions on how to go about gathering this type of information through the twitter API, I would very much appreciate it.

It sends 10 frames, resulting in 4920 bytes sent. Then sends the final 808bytes with the last frame.p  pSimilar for Ethernet. 1500  18bytes with each frame. 3 frames sent means 4446 bytes sent.
