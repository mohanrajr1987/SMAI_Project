Positive 5954 pAfter reading through numerous answers concerning these topics, I have found myself completely unable to string together the pieces of the puzzle, I hope you will excuse me for this.p  pI am trying to change my simple socket connection in Java to use SSL. I would like both the server and client to authenticate themselves if possible, but only server authentication would be good start.p  pCurrently, this is the extremely simple code on the server sidep  precode    ServerSocket serverSocket  new ServerSocketport     Socket socket  serverSocket.accept codepre  pAnd this is the code on the client sidep  precode    Socket socket  null     while true          try              socket  new SocketipAddress, port             break          catch Exception e       codepre  pThis works fine, but without SSL.p  pI have generated SSL certificates for the server and client using OpenSSL, ending up withp  ul liA certificate for the server PEM formatli liA certificate for the client PEM formatli liA private key for the server PEM formatli liA private key for the client PEM formatli liA CA file PEM, CER and CRT formatli ul  pFrom this I have used OpenSSL to create PKCS12 .p12 keystores for both the client and the server, as followsp  ul liserver.p12, made by doing iopenssl pkcs12 export in servercert.pem inkey serverprivatekey.pem out server.p12ili liclient.p12, made by doing iopenssl pkcs12 export in clientcert.pem inkey clientprivatekey.pem out client.p12ili ul  pThen, I turned these into JKS keystores by using keytool for the server, for example, the command was ikeytool importkeystore srckeystore server.p12 srcstoretype PKCS12 destkeystore server.jks deststoretype JKSi, resulting in two files named iserver.jksi and iclient.jksi.p  pI then use the following code as replacement for the previous server snippetp  precode    char[] keyStorePassword   JKSPassword.toCharArray     FileInputStream keyStoreFile  new FileInputStreamsomepathserver.jks     KeyStore keyStore  KeyStore.getInstanceJKS     keyStore.loadkeyStoreFile, keyStorePassword     KeyManagerFactory keyManagerFactory  KeyManagerFactory.getInstanceKeyManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm     keyManagerFactory.initkeyStore, PKCS12Password.toCharArray     SSLContext sslContext  SSLContext.getDefault     ServerSocket serverSocket  sslContext.getServerSocketFactory.createServerSocketport     Socket socket  serverSocket.accept codepre  pAnd the following code as replacement for the client snippetp  precode    Socket socket  null     while true          try              char[] keyStorePassword   JKSPassword.toCharArray             FileInputStream keyStoreFile  new FileInputStreamsomepathclient.jks             KeyStore keyStore  KeyStore.getInstanceJKS             keyStore.loadkeyStoreFile, keyStorePassword             KeyManagerFactory keyManagerFactory  KeyManagerFactory.getInstanceKeyManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm             keyManagerFactory.initkeyStore, PKCS12Password.toCharArray             SSLContext sslContext  SSLContext.getDefault             socket  sslContext.getSocketFactory.createSocketipAddress, port             break          catch Exception e       codepre  pI now still get ijavax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException no cipher suites in commoni on the server and ijavax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException Received fatal alert handshakefailurei on the client.p  pWhat could be wrongp
Positive 5954 pIm try to understand how the Certificated works in the https protocol.p  pWith wireshark, I can capture the certificates, first,I export the singedCertificate, and calculate the hash value Second, I export the encrypted data, and decrypt it with the public key, the result should equal to the hash of signedCertificate.p  pThis is an example of the decryptionp  p3021300906052b0e03021a05000414a1038465d47c003d8540ec33879f86e24c43b21ap  pI found that a1038465d47c003d8540ec33879f86e24c43b21a equal to the hash of the signedCertificate, but the head 3021300906052b0e03021a05000414 seemed something relates to the method of hash and encryption.p  pSo, my question is,whats the format of this a1038465d47c003d8540ec33879f86e24c43b21a.p  pthanksp
Positive 5954 pI am trying to implement authentication on my webapplication using client certificates.p  pIve changed my web.xml to include the CLIENTCERT as auth method. and CONFIDENTIAL as the transport. Since my application server is Apache Geronimo Ive decided to create a new keystore and a private key , signing it using own Geronimos CA. p  pMy questions are 1. Does this newly created keystore contains only the private key or also the client certificate. 2. If not how do I create the client certificate to import on certificate store of the operating system p  pI am a bit lost here, so Id like you to tell me some pointer, tips or hints on how to accomplish this.p  pBest regards, Ivan Frias p

Positive 5954 pDoes adding a certificate exception in Firefox tell it to trust a certificate, an address, or a combination of both  See the following hypotheticalp  pFirst, I hypothetically visit a hrefhttpsfoo.com relnofollowhttpsfoo.coma, which uses a selfsigned certificate. My browser alerts me that the certificate is selfsigned, but I choose to add an exception in firefox 40s settings under emAdvanced  Certificates  View Certificates  Serversem.  p  pNow lets say I go to a hrefhttpsbar.com relnofollowhttpsbar.coma, and it presents the exact same certificate.  Will firefox trust this site, because it uses a trusted certificate, or will it warn me because the certificate is not trusted at this addressp  pNow lets say I revisit a hrefhttpsfoo.com relnofollowhttpsfoo.coma in a couple weeks, and they have since generated and started using a new certificate The CA is the same, but I have not added the CA as a trusted root.  Will firefox show me a warning, because the certificate is not trusted  Or will it trust the site, because it is a trusted address p  pOr is there another angle to thisp  pthanksp

In that case, at any future time, the   tokens signed with the corresponding key will be considered as   invalid, but tokens generated before the revocation time will remain   valid.  When the reasonCode extension relative to the revoked   certificate from the TSA is not present in the CRL entry extensions,   then all the tokens that have been signed with the corresponding key   SHALL be considered as invalid.
