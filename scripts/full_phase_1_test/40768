Positive 40768 pHi Im trying to understand how this handshake works and JWT. So I have something as web page where the some user can go and login itself. Then I create an JWT, so when I do request to the server I use this token to verify the user. I would like to create and websoket connection and use this token as well. so I did the server like thisp  precodevar server  app.listen3000, function     console.logServer listening on, 3000  require.websockets.connectserver codepre  pIn that file websockets.js I havep  precodevar    requirelodash var ws  requirews var url  requireurl var jwt  requirejwtsimple var config  require.config var clients  []  exports.connect  functionserver      var wss  new ws.Serverserverserver         wss.onconnection, functionws              var location  url.parsews.upgradeReq.url, true             var token  location.query.token              console.log ws.upgradeReq.headers               console.log New connection.              try                  var user  jwt.decode token, config.secret              catch err                  ws.close                           clients[token]  ws              ws.onmessage, functiondata, flags                   console.log ws.upgradeReq.headers                   console.log data                            ws.onclose, function                 .removeclients, token                 if user                      console.logUser disconnect  user.username                 else                     console.log Authentication failed.                                        codepre  pSo the problem is that, If I login in the broswer and I copy that token which is in the headers. I can connect to the server with different terminal using wscat.
