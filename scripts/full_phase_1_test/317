Positive 317 pThis is a rather complicated question, but I will try my best to describe it as well as possible.p  pI currently have 2 tables that are joined on an codeinstaidcode. p  pThe first table is called codeSocstatcode and it contains a lot of entries of Instagram posts. The columns I use in my SQL Qeury are codeinstaidcode and codemaintagcode.p  pThe other table is called codetagscode and includes an codeinstaidcode and all the codetagnamescode that has been used with that codeinstaidcode.p  pThe codetagscode table looks like this.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com6cSjC.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com6cSjC.png altenter image description hereap  pMy current SQL query looks like thisp  precodeSELECT tagnames FROM socstat JOIN tags ON socstat.instaid  tags.instaid WHERE maintag  hashtag codepre  pNow the issue is that currently I have 110000 rows in the codetagscode table, and the query above is taking such a long time that it often times out. But I think I might have found a solution The codemaintagcode from the codesocstatcode table is always represented under codetagnamescode in the codetagscode table.p  pSo maybe I dont have to join the two tables Wouldnt it be possible to just check the codetagscode table for all the codeinstaidcodes that contains a codetagnamecode equal to codehashtagcodeand then fetch all the codetagnamescode that are linked to those codeinstaidcodesp  pemEditemp  pI just used added an codeexplaincode to my Query on a hashtag I know there is problems with and the result is as followsp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comlYSEv.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comlYSEv.png altenter image description hereap  pAnd here I have done it on a much less used hashtag where it is still slow, but not nearly as slowp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comoJ58L.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoJ58L.png altenter image description hereap

I ended up just adding two columns that looked up the shipping date from each table, and then with the location column, I just did if this is bigger than that Plant A if false Plant B and hid the two columns that formula looked like indextable2,Matcha1ampB1,EEampFF,0,1... but then I realized that it was pulling the oldest date from the second two tables instead of the newest one... making it worthless. p  pSo, I guess my first question is how do you get an INDEXMATCH function to find the highest value   p  pAnd my second is there any way to do it how I wanted to originally I tried using multiple indexmatch functions nested in an If function but it was super messy and refused to work or should I just keep my two hidden columns set up goingp

Negative 317 pGreetings , to cut it short , below is the codep  h3bThe Codebh3  precode This program would sum up all the integer provided by user  include ltstdio.hgt  int mainvoid   int sum  0                   initialize and declare variable  int num  char check  int status   printfPlease enter an integer to be summed   prompt user for an integer  status  scanfd , ampnum                                    whilestatus  1                              If user enter an integer , while loop test condition is true        sum  sum  num                           sum the input integer     printfDo you wanna add more integeryn    Asking for user next action     scanfc , ampcheck            ifcheck  y                   Check users answer          status  scanfd , ampnum      else          status  0        return 0  codepre  pbThe problembp  pThe first thing I do when I run the program is to provide an integer , after that it would just print out the controlstring codeDo you wanna add more integeryn code.Then the problem arouse , instead of waiting for me to type codeycode or codencode , the program would just end itself , which mean in Windows command prompt it would give me the line codePress any key to continue....code.p  pI keep read through the code line by line to find any semantic error assume theres no syntax error since compiler wouldve complained if theres one or any logical error that I made , but to no avail.So I suspect is it theres any rules of C that mention We shouldnt prompt use codeifcode with character as test value when it is enclosed in codewhilecode loop or any other thing that Ive neglectedp  pThanks for keeping yourself tied up to read my problem , hope I would really learn from you guys, do point out any mistake I made as Im a learner who ready to accept any comment or teaching that is correct.p
