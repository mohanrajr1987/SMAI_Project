Positive 3496 pSo Ive got this script to find a random number between two usertyped in values. The max part works, the randomly generated number is never higher than the higher number. But the numbers generated are still from 1 to the highest number, not whatever min to set to. What am I doing wrongp  pLooking at other codes Ive tried the max  min  1  min formula but it gave the exact same result as Im having now. And sometimes it didnt register at all. It may be a simple syntax problem Im missing Other variations end up with the random generated number concencrated with the value of min instead of adding the two number values together. For example, between 10 and 20, Ill roll an 8 and it will display 810 in the answer box, instead of 18 like it should be.p  precodeltscriptgt function rollthedice  var minA  document.getElementByIdhpone.value var maxA  document.getElementByIdhptwo.value var rangeA  minA,maxA var resultA  Math.floorMath.random  rangeA  1 document.getElementByIdhpresult.value  resultA ltscriptgt codepre
Positive 3496 pI have a double value which is in the range of 01. The new highscore value should be the lesser value of the two.

Please be descriptive as Im a beginner, thank you. p  pEDIT Sorry I didnt make it descriptive enough, but I want the highscore to be saved and be able to be accessed again.
