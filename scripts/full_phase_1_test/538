Positive 538 pstrongI just started learning Erlang so please bear with me if this question seems a little simple.strongp  pHi guys. Ive been thinking about it for a while but nothing I come up with seems to be working.p  pI am writing an Erlang function that is supposed to take a list as an argument then print the list with my name in front of it. For the purposes of this question, lets say my name is James.p  pIf I type in codetestmoduleNameInFrontLegible, Hey, Think.code Erlang should return code[James, Legible, Hey, Think]codep  pThis is the code I have so farp  pcodemoduletestmodule.codep  pcodeexport[NameInFront1].codep  pcodeNameInFrontListgt [James][List].codep  pIt works just fine when I type in just one word, which I guess it the fault of the codeNameInFront1code part but I want it to be able to handle any amount of words I type in. Anyone know how I can get my function to handle multiple inputs Thank you very much.p

But I need to frequently update the values noncode text and data the stuff people actually see on my website within the code. All the text and data sports statistics I display on the site come from a spreadsheet that updates regularly. p  pIs there a way to link the data spaces in my copied html document with their source cells in my spreadsheet Or do I just have to enter them manually as Ive been doingp

Negative 538 pOk I hope I can make this understandable... So I created an UI in QT designer  named heatwindow.ui Next I wrote this following script in a file named heatwindow.pyp  precodefrom PySide import QtGui, QtCore, QtUiTools from HeatModel import  from vsmutils import   class HeatWindow Main window class for the Flow application      def initself, app         Class constructor          Assign our application instance as a member variable         self.app  app          Create an instance of our HeatModel class         self.heatModel  HeatModel          Load and show our user interface         self.ui  loadUiWidgetheatwindow.ui          self.ui.show          self.ui.raise  if name  main      app  appInstance     app.Create     HeatWindowapp     window  HeatWindowapp     app.Run codepre  pOk, so vsmutils is a script that we got from our teacher... Anyways  my problem is that nothing happens when running the script. Actually it seems the process in Python gets killed entirely, I have to press Run again this program Spyder in the Console. When debugging it seems this happens after the linep  precodewindow  HeatWindowapp codepre  pI hope this is enough info to help me, if not please tell what I should addp  pRegardsp
Negative 538 pThis is as much a question about learning objectoriented methodology, for me, as it is about VBA syntax. Suppose I create several classes, like Car, Truck, Bus, etc. And I create another class SpeedCalculator, which instances of my vehicles will instantiate and contain. As a newbie, let me note that this strikes me as a good time to declare a class as static and not instantiate itwhich vba cant do I dont think... . Now this speed calculator will be no simple speedometer. Rather it will calculate speed from temperature, windspeed, RPMs, etc, etcgo along with this please, just for the sake of the example. p  pNow the question is how for the contained object to collect its inputs, which are only available in the container objects the vehicle objects might implement an interface if VBA can even do that.... Parent. is wrong, I figured out eventually, bc parentchild is an inheritance relation which VBA doesnt have, again, not a containment relation, and the parent of the contained object is an Excel Application not my object. So it seems it would be nice if there were another keyword to refer to container properties. I hope I havent just missed something simple. Or is it more the case that that sort of reference would break objectoriented encapsultaion principles p  pI guess a second approach would be to pass the container to the contained, via Me as an argument. But then you have to multiply all of the containeds methods, either to overload them if VBA can even do that..., or with variously named versionsdue to the different types of the containers can we be more idealist and avoid declaring as variant or Object.p  pAnd then door 3 would be the last door standing, I guess Which would be to pass an annoying litany of arguments. The definition of all of which would tend to defeat the purpose of having my tidy little calculator class p
