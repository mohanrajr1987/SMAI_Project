Positive 1136 pSo I am working with java SWT spinner, but my issue is that when the number is more than one digit i.e. higher than 10, the spinner does not get bigger to contain the two digits or more. Therefore, the user is unable to see the number that he entered. Do you know how to make it autoresize and refresh its size switch to the user entry and the size of the number p  pEDIT  Code used p  precodeacquisitionTime  new Spinnercontainer, SWT.BORDER     acquisitionTime.setEnabledtrue     acquisitionTime.setMinimum1       codepre  pThanks for your help Peacep
Positive 1136 pIm programming a JFace Table with ownerdrawing by assigning the columns an OwnerDrawCellLabelProvider. Im now happy with how the body of the table looks, but would like to also adjust the look of the table header. p  pIs there any API way I can get access to how the header of each column is drawn I can always create a second customdrawn table to serve as the header of the first table, but that seems a little silly.p

Positive 1136 pI added a OS.PeekMessage loop to my main while loop in my Java SWT application with respect to running on Windows, see code following. I can detect all sorts of messages, just not WMQUERYENDSESSION value 17 and WMENDSESSION value 22. I went to the GUI designer in Eclipse for the shell and perused the events and did not see anything related to the end session. I realize that I can query the a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions981306howtodetectwhetherwindowsisshuttingdownorrestartingWindows registrya, but I do need to handle via code. Think app certification kits and whatnot.p  precodeimport org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.MSG import org.eclipse.swt.internal.win32.OS  ... while shell.isDisposed      ...

Positive 1136 pI am using Nebula Grid widget in my RCP application. I have added a controlListener to my Grid which will resize the each of the Grid row heights whenever the Grid Control is resized. the code snippet is as followsp  precodeOverride public void controlResizedControlEvent e      GridColumn []cols  grid.getColumns     for GridItem item  grid.getItems          GC gc  new GCitem.getDisplay          int max  0         Point tbnull         forGridColumn col  cols             tb  col.getCellRenderer.computeSizegc, col.getWidth, SWT.DEFAULT, item             max  Math.maxmax, tb.y             ifmax gt hmax                 break                                ifhmax1          else ifmax gt hmax             maxhmax                   gc.dispose         item.setHeightmax       codepre  pThis is working fine ie., the height is adjusted each time the user resizes any of the column. But whenever the number of grid rows is huge say few hundreds to thousands, the resizing is not smooth. The UI is not responsive for a few seconds. on doing some analysis, I could narrow down on the statement responsible for this delay. that is the below statementp  precodetb  col.getCellRenderer.computeSizegc, col.getWidth, SWT.DEFAULT, item codepre  pI could understand the reason for this . This above statement is called for each row and a column and that seems to be the reason.  for a Grid of 2000 rows and 5 columns, this statement is called 10000 times. how can I make this process performant p
Positive 1136 pI have been working on codeCollectionscode recently and I have a potentially huge list of items to be processed that is returned by the backend.  For example my codeListcode has 100 items in it and Im iterating over this list in the outermost codefor loopcodeas mentioned below  p  precodefor final Iterator i  listItems.iterator i.hasNext    for final Iterator it  hugeListItems.iterator it.hasNext      For each of the item in this outermost for loop I have another      List of 1000 items to be processed in the inner for loop,       so that would potentially lead to huge amount of processing, in my case          1001000 times      codepre  pAll these items after processing will be added to a Map. p  pThe processing of these items takes a significant amount of time which hits the overall performance of my Application. I tried printing size of the Map inside the for loop and in Eclipse I work on Eclipse IDE I could see the thread execution halting at codeModelContext Threadcode and the console slowly printing the size of the Map after each execution of the inner for loop 1000 items which is really bad with respect to timeefficiency. Is there a way I could break down these operations into smaller modules and increase timeefficiencyp  pCould someone please suggestadvice a better approach to process these huge list of items considering that the items returned by the backend may grow over time My new approach should reduce the execution time by a fair margin, otherwise the overall performance of my Application would really be bad.p  pIs there a more cleaner and efficient way to handle these increasingly rare scenariosp  pThank you All.p

Positive 1136 pI have a Jface TableViewer in my Eclipse RCP app whose columns are all drawn by OwnerDrawLabelProviders. My cells are now all being drawn the way that I want, but Im unable to use an OwnerDrawLabelProvider to draw anything outside of the current cell being drawn. p  pIve illustrated the problem below. If the cell with the green background is being drawn, and I attempt to draw a red line across the entire table, the red line stops being drawn as soon as I exit the cell. p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comxhLWs.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comxhLWs.png altenter image description hereap  pI thought that what was happening here is that the other cells were drawing over the top of the red line, but I showed this wasnt the case by deactivating the paint, measure, and erase methods for the next column. Instead, I think whats happening is that the Table is hiding my red line in a lower display layer as soon as it leaves the cell.p  pIs there any way to draw outside the cell with an OwnerDrawLabelProvider I have a workaround, namely issuing the same draw command in each cell that would be drawn in, but thats pretty ugly and could potentially lead to performance problems.p

If you have a loop within a loop and want to skip to the next iteration of the outer loop without completing the inner OR the outer loop you can execute codecontinue maincode.

Negative 1136 pI am making a predictive model in python with scikitlearn, and I am trying to cross validate to get a valid F1 score. However, depending on my CV method, I am getting very different results. It seems that issues like this are typically due to overfitting or bad data, but in this case that shouldnt explain how my methods give consistent internal results even with different splits, but always differ from each other. codexcode is my dataset, codeycode is the labels, and coderfbestcode is my classifier.

Negative 1136 pI have a simple form select drop down that filters rows by cities. Now what I am trying to do is to filter those results based on users location.
