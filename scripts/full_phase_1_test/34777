Positive 34777 pi want to be able to display a grid of business cards with an image of an employee in SSRS SQL 2008.p  pFor this I have created a query pulling the following data from Employee tablep  ol liEmployeeIDli liEmployeeNameli liEmployeeImageli ol  pThe images are stored directly in the database.p  pI have created a blank report, formatted it to have 3 columns re sized it to a fairly small size, inserted a table and deleted all the cells except for one. I have added EmployeeID and EmployeeName into the cell. When run, the report displays exactly what i want grid of employees with their ID and Name.p  pIn order to display the image, I have added another cell to the original onecell table and inserted the image control into it. The Use this field value of the image isp  precodeFirstFieldsEmployeeImage.Value, Employees codepre  pThe inserted image is a jpeg, thus the MIME type is set to imagejpeg.p  pWhen i run this, i still get the list of Employees details as before, however the cell, where the image is to be displayed is empty.  p  pDoes anyone have any tips on how to achieve what i am looking for p  pThanksp  pPS I have googled this without a luck  p
Positive 34777 pSo I have a simple table in SSRS with three columns. The first is Agent the name of a call handler and the second is populated by a parameter that controls which of 6 possible columns to display data for.

The 2nd column data textbox on the report contains the following expressionp  precodeFieldsParametersField.Value.Value codepre  pSo whichever of the column names is picked from the drop down list before the report is run will display in the second column.p  pWhat I cant figure out how to get working is thisp  pI need to add a parameter that will let the user select a rank number of 5, 10, 20 or 50 that will show the Top 5, 10, 20 or 50 Agents based on the numbers that come back in whichever of the columns is selected. I tried to add the following to the dataset queryp  precodeROWNUMBER OVER partition BY Field ORDER BY Field DESC AS rn codepre  pAnd then add column rn as the third column in the report. I then applied a filter to the tablix to say where column rn lt the value of a parameter I created called rank. The values of which were 6, 11, 21 amp 51 always one higher than the actual amount of ranked values to take account of less than. Although I guess I could use lt p  pWhat happened was the list of Agents and values was displayed on the report with the correct number of ranked values shown in column three as selected from the rank drop down parameter, but the values of the  main column were NOT ranked in a descending order. They appeared to be completely at random. So its like the ROWNUMBER column I added to the dataset query isnt interested in the columns that are inside the parameter. I just cant figure a way to get those ranked values back based on top 5, 10, 20 or 50 Sp

Negative 34777 pIm writing a pretty simple game in Java, and Im running into the issue of very serious flickering when I play the game as an applet in a browser.

I read an a hrefhttpjavaboutique.internet.comtutorialsStepChapter4DoubleBuffering.html relnofollowexamplea in which the sprite was painted straight to the JApplet, without using a JPanel.
