Positive 352 pWe have an application with multiple WCF services hosted as windows services which basically perform ETL operation on about 2  4 million records per day. We are currently using Microsoft SQL server 2012 as the database with Nhibernate as ORM.I am exploring the possibility of changing the underlying RDBMS to MariaDB, mainly because of the cost advantage over SQL server.I searched the internet and Stackoverflow for this combination of using Nhibernate ORM with MariaDB but could not find any useful resource.I know that MariaDB is derived from MySQL and there are drivers available for MySQL for working with NHibernate but I am not sure whether I can use the MySQL connector with MariaDB and Nhibernate ORM. Here are some of the specific requirements for my application.p  ol liChange to MariaDb should have least impact on the ORM layerNHibernate in my case.li lithe application needs highly performant DB and I should be able to tune it for handling millions of transactions in near real time scenario. li liI fetch from a SQL server DB over using MSMQ which I cannot change.li liTHere are multiple and continuous reads and writes from a few tables. I need good indexing capability in the DB tables.li ol  pCan somebody please guide me whether it is possible to easily move to MariaDB , still keeping the Nhibernate ORM and if yes, some resources to help me figure out the implementation details.p
