Positive 4804 pC11 has 6 different regular expression grammars you can use.  In my case, I am interacting with a component that is using modified ECMAScript regular expressions.p  pI need to create a regular expression match a string starting with X, where X is a string literal I have.p  pSo the regular expression I want is roughly codeX.code.  Except the string X could contain more regular expression special characters, and I want them to occur.p  pWhich means I really want code escapedX .code.p  pNow, I can read over the ECMAScript documentation, find all of the characters which have a special meaning, write a function that escapes them, and be done.  But this seems inelegant, inefficient, and error prone  especially if I want to support all 6 kinds of regular expressions that C supports currently, let alone in the future.p  pIs there a simple way in the standard to escape a literal string to embed in a C regular expression, possibly as a function of the regular expression grammar, or do I have to roll my ownp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq12529921774667Herea is a similar question using the boost library, where the list of escapes is hardcoded, and then a regular expression is generated that backslashes them.

Positive 4804 pSo basically Ive been digging deep into the realm of MySQL and PHPspecifically the security measures I should take when dealing with a database and form inputs.  So far Ive found that the following are very strongly recommendedp  ol liPrepared Statementsli liUsing mysqlirealescapestringli liNOT using Magic Quotes as it confuses databases and ends up giving you stuff like Youre name isnt.li ol  pAll of this is great and Ive been following it.  However, I was wondering if one should also escape characters such as the dollars sign [], percentage sign [], and possibly others.  Couldnt the query interpret the dollar sign as a PHP variable perhaps  What about LIKE syntax Ive heard that uses the  symbol or even the wildcard sign  Prepared statements should technically take care of all of this, but I just wanted to be safe and make sure I had everything escaped properly.  In the case that I forget to use prepared statements or just neglect to do them, I was hoping this second line of defense persay could save me a loooong headache.p  pHere is what I use for escaping currentlyp  precodefunction escapeconnection, data     newdata  trimdata     newdata  mysqlirealescapestringconnection, newdata     newdata  addcslashesnewdata,      newdata  htmlspecialcharsnewdata, ENTNOQUOTES      return newdata   codepre  pSo is this proper  Am I doing something horrendously wrong Notice that I would have to remove back slashes before the , , and  characters when retreiving the database data.p

Negative 4804 pI have a problem that is driving me nuts I really hope that someone in here can help me solve this one...p  pSituation. I have a repeater with two elements showing on initial page load. Each element has a delete button, that removes that particular element from the database.
