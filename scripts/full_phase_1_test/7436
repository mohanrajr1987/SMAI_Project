Positive 7436 pDue to how Unity3D works in browsers through WebGL, the catching part of a trycatch will instantly crash the game. This is mainly due to it just not being supported for a release build. There are debug builds to work with trycatch, but that has consequences as well In the end i have to refactor some code to work without any trycatch in it, to prevent it from locking up for a user.p  pHere is what i currently havep  precodetry         using StreamReader reader  new StreamReaderApplication.persistentDataPathCHARVER.BIN                      JSONNode characterImages             string json  reader.ReadToEnd             ifstring.IsNullOrEmptyjson                 throw new System.IO.FileNotFoundException             else                   characterImages  JSON.Parsejson                 test the image file inside                 Texture2D loadedImage  new Texture2D1,1,TextureFormat.ARGB32,false                 try                     loadedImage.LoadImageFile.ReadAllBytesApplication.persistentDataPath  characterImages [Characters][0][texture]                     ifloadedImage                         throw new System.IO.FileNotFoundException                                                       catchSystem.Exception ex                     Debug.LogError[DOWNLOAD]Test image file was not found ex                     ThrowBackToLoginNo image file was found.                     yield break                                            catchSystem.Exception ex         Debug.Log[DOWNLOAD]Test file was not found ex         ThrowBackToLoginNo version file found.         yield break      codepre  pHow could i refactor this to remove the trycatch parts I cant possibly manually avert all the exceptions that File.RealAllBytes can throw at me, right I can imagine just calling a exception message method to just take a message and respond to the failed check and return right after, to replace the throw new System.IO.FileNotFoundException  since i throw that myself.

Positive 7436 pI know the best way to prevent system crashes is catching all possible exception in different methods. So I use try catch blocks every where in my code. However as you know sometimes you forget to test some scenarios which cause some unhanded exceptions and a user gets Unfortunately App stopped working... message. This is bad for any application. Unfortunately the people who will use my app are not native English, so they will not understand crash message too. p  pSo I want to know is it possible to catch all possible exception globally  with just one try catch block in some main classes not all classes and methods and strongreload application automaticallystrong and without any weird messages Or at least is it possible to strongchange the crash messagestrongp  pTanks.p

Negative 7436 pI have started playing with developing apps for the android. I have a site hosted on an IIS server that uses Windows authentication. I want to connect to it through my app. When I access the site from a computer or phone it prompts for the username and password. However, I cannot get the webview to pop up the credentials prompt, nor have I been able to pass the username and password to the site in my MainActivity when using the emulator target 4.4 API 19.  p  pI have been working on this for a while looking a tons of examples. Its difficult to relate the code I have seen to my specific situation, I have copied and pasted number examples. I keep getting 401 unauthorized when the page comes up. p  pI am trying to stick with the android app thing this time, so any help would be greatly greatly appreciated.

Negative 7436 pI am currently writing a C script to create an XML file based on a sample I have been given and typically I add an element like sop  precodenode.Addnew XElementNodeName, new XCDataValue codepre  pHowever on the XML sample it uses the following before the CDATA to create a space in the finished document as transformed in html laterp  precodeamp160  The XML is like ltNodeNamegtamp160amp160ltCDATA[Value]]gtltNodeNamegt codepre  pI have tried to add spaces before the value in the XCData declaration but it always ignores them, is there some way I can either add the same as the XML, preserve any spaces I put in or perhaps tab before the valuep

Negative 7436 pI am actually using Sequel plugin validationhelpers, and i did not have any problem using the validatespresence option. But when i try to use validatesunique it does not do anything. I tried to put UNIQUE on my columns, but it raise an error and i just want an error in my sent message. Here is what i did so farp  precodeclass User lt SequelModel   plugin validationhelpers   def validates      super      validatespresence[username, email]      validatesuniqueusername   end end codepre  pSo when i forget to put either a username or a mail it send an error Json object, but i can post as much user with the same username as i want.p  pSo... Do someone can think about a solutionp
