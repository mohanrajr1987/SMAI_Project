Positive 10851 pIm working on a library which Id like certain introspection features to be available. Lets say Im compiling with clang, so I have access to libtooling or whatever.p  pWhat Id like specifically is for someone to be able to view the LLVM IR of an alreadycompiled function as part of the program. I know that, when compiling, I can use emitllvm to get the IR. But that saves it to a file. What Id like is for the LLVM IR to be embedded in and retrievable from the program itself  e.g. myfunctionobject.llvmirp  pIs such a thing possible Thanksp
