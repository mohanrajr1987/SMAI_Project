Positive 2556 pNote This might be a long question. p  pMy task is to find the shortest route between servers, using python 3.p  pI start in a server, lets call it A, and I need to get to server X. Every server has some options of connection so I begin mapping the whole map of possible routes. p  pThe first challenge its that I cant use lists nor dictionaries. So Ive created MyList class I asked some questions on how to program it here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32553396howcanimakemylistiterableHow can I make MyList iterablea that behaves like a list. p  pThen I created a Node class which is programmed this way p  precodeclass Node  def initself, name, parentNone     self.name  name     self.parents  List     if parent is not None         self.parents.addparent     self.childs  List     self.connections  0     self.counter  0     self.ready  False  def addNodeself, name, parent     if self.name  parent.name         self.childs.addNodename, self     else         for child in self.childs             child.addNodename, parent  def getNodeself, name     if self.name  name         return self     else         for child in self.childs             node  child.getNodename             if node                 return node codepre  pMy idea is to create a node for every server. p  pThe childs I know, it should be called children are servers which can be accessed directly from the node server, and the parents are servers that have direct access to the node. p  pBasically, theyre lists of other nodes. p  pOnce Ive mapped most of the servers I want to get the shortest route from node A to node X. p  pI tried taking into account all the node X parents, and in those nodes do the same, until I get to node A. But it took too long and I couldnt record well the routes and compare them. Sort of Dijkstras algorithm. Any idea how can I do itp  pEdit self.counter increases every time the node makes a connection, once it reaches a certain number it resets to zero and self.connections increases by one. Finally, once self.connections its equal the quantity of possible connections for the server self.ready becomes True. Once 23 of the nodes are ready I stop the mapping.  p
Positive 2556 pstrongDisclaimerstrong This description contains a lot of Qt specific functionality.

Positive 2556 pIm writing a compiler in a functional style. The type checker is currently fairly straightforward its mostly just a function from codeExprcode to codeTypecode.p  pNow, I want to add a step to the workflow that preserves the type information for later stages. There are a number of ways to do this symbol tables, etc., but a simple one is to translate into an IR that looks like the AST but contains type information. For example, if the AST data type isp  precodedatatype Expr  Literal of int                Add of Expr  Expr                ... codepre  pThen the typed IR would bep  precodetype TExpr  Type  TExpr datatype TExpr  TLiteral of int                  TAdd of TExpr  TExpr                  ... codepre  pSo my goal now is to convert my type checker into a type annotator a function codeExpr gt TExprcode instead of codeExpr gt Typecode. Heres my question emHow would you do this without adding a bunch of boilerplate clutter to the type checker functionemp  pNaively, I would need to add wrapping and unwrapping code all over the place, ruining the simple legibility of the type checker function as it stands. That is, the case for codeAddcode in the type checker currently looks likep  precodelet lhst  check lhs in let rhst  check rhs in case lhst, rhst of   Int, Int gt Int  ,  gt Error codepre  pNice and clean Exactly matches the typing judgment in the formalism p  pIf I mucked up the type checker with the additional translation logic, it would look like this now codecheckcode has type codeExpr gt TExprcodep  precode Recursive calls to translate the children.  let lhstyped  check lhs in let rhstyped  check rhs in  We dont care about the expression for checking, just the resulting   type. So extract that from each child.  let lhst,   lhstyped in let rhst,   rhstyped in case Int, Int gt    Construct a TExpr with the new type.    Int, TAdd lhstyped, rhstyped  ,  gt Error codepre  pThis has unpleasantly intermingled the interesting type checking logic with the boring boilerplate for destructing and constructing codeTExprcode. p  pIs there any way to separate these components That is, can the type checking logic live in one recursive function while the translation machinery acts as an external client of it Bonus points if its still easy to run the type checker emwithoutem doing translation if you want to.p  hr  pBonus context this follows the Separate IR option from a hrefhttpblog.ezyang.com201305theasttypingproblem relnofollowEdward Z.

Positive 2556 pIm new to functional programming and have a question about what is going on in this function.  Once takes a function and then returns a new version that can only be called  . . . once, and then returns undefined after that.  To me it seems like apply is adding code to the fn function, but I suspect that that is not the case.
