Could someone clarify which of these two answers is the right one li lianother important reason database files in the assets folder must be copied somewhere else is because files in that location cannot be updated.

Note that this restriction is not relevant if your database is smaller that 1 Mb, or you do not mind dividing your database in 1 Mb chunks and putting them together at runtime, or you do not mind distributing a database file with a mp3 extension.li liIf the database file is copied from the assets folder to datadataYOURPACKAGEdatabases, there is no way to delete the original database file at the assets folder to avoid having a duplicated file. This is also because files in the assets folder cannot be modified.li ul  pMaking the puzzle a bit more complex I found in the comments to the accepted answer of this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions513084howtoshipanandroidapplicationwithadatabaseHow to ship an Android application with a databasea that copying the database from the assets folder to another location in fact does not work on some devices running 2.3.
