Positive 26050 pIm using a hrefhttpsgithub.commodocacheMDCSwipeToChoose relnofollowMDCSwipeToChoosea in my application. Usually the views passed to the module have one view controller because they bare resemblance to a sort of cards. In my case, the cardsviews passed to the module differ to much to have just one controller. p  pI have found several solutions to this problem but my lack of experience with iOS programming has left me uncertain which one to choose. Im using the storyboard for my view controllers but I want my viewscards to get a controller assigned programmatically. Are there any disadvantages to doing so other than the storyboard containing a view controller without and segues visually connected to it p  pFurthermore, Ive considered the possibility of implementing it a hrefhttpsandmoose.compost35714028270storyboardswithcustomcontainerviewcontrollers relnofollowthisa way. It would make the storyboard more comprehensible but seems like a detour jus wanting the codeCardManagercode to receive all data and pass correct codeUIViewcode to codeMDCSwipeToChoosecodep
