Positive 63 pThere exists an enum class that will cause problems downstream if it is changed without also making changes to the downstream project. Unfortunately, this is not easily identified by just searching for usages of the enum. We have had big warning comments in the code saying Dont change this without also changing downstream project, but apparently that wasnt enough Murphys Law held firm. I need some other way of preventing other developers or future me from breaking things. p  pMy current approach is to create a Unit test that will throw an error whenever the enum is changed. Changing the enum will therefore cause the build to fail which should get the attention of the developer. Included in the failure message will be instructions on how to safely update the enum. Unfortunately I cant see any way of writing this unit test short of copying the entire enum into the test class and then comparing every value from the test enum to the actual enum.p  pIs there a way that I can avoid duplicating the enum in the test class here Is there a best practice that you recognize I should be following based on my descriptionp

Positive 63 pWe have VS2013 hooked into SVN as our repository. We have Team City hooked into SVN. I am trying to create a build in Team City, but the build here keeps failing. The VS2013 project has a reference to another project and this is referenced via Nuget. On our local machine from within VS2013 the solution builds with no errors. When we check the source in to SVN, team City picks up that something has changed and then fails stating that it cannot find a reference to the file other project. The other projects source is stored in the same SVN repository and I thought that I might have to set this as an codeartefactcode to this project. However I seem to be having issues building the artefact command correctly. Can anyone point me to a good example of building the artefact command line, as I suspect it needs to build this first to be able to make a reference.p

Negative 63 pIm using Backbone.Relational with Backbone.Marionette and Backbone.ioSync to sync over socket.io.p  pMore specifically, I have a model codeAcode that codehasManycode instances of mode codeBcode through relation codebeescode. On load, all is well data initialized and rendered appropriately. Then, another client adds another instance of codeBcode to codeA.beescode. The server sends a ping to the first client, which causes it to call codeA.fetchcode. In the success method of the fetch, I call codeA.fetchRelatedbeescode. The fetch method returns only a list of IDs for the codebeescode relation, triggering a codechangecode on codeAcode, causing Backbone.Marionattes collection view to create a new instance of the item view to display the new codeBcode, which breaks the site since the new codeBcode hasnt been fetched yet.p  pTrying to force the rendering of Bs view to sync on a deferred object defined in A sounds like a complex hack with likely many edge cases to handle.p  pOne idea is to allow codefetchcode to accept the codesilentcode option. But its probably tricky to trigger the codechangecode and codeaddcode events in the codesuccesscode function of codefetchcode.p  pAnother idea is to make the serialization code on the server emcontext awareem and send the entire object, not just the IDs, when a new item is added. This is also sub optimal as it may cause unnecessary transfer of entire identical Bs when theyre added to different As. It also adds a lot of complexity to the server code as the context would need to propagate throughout the serialization process.p  pAny thoughts or suggestions of how to approach this I am open to solutions that may require changes to Backbone.Marionette or Backbone.Relational as long as it works.p
