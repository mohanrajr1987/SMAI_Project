Negative 522 pI have a Axis 1.4 with Spring web service client consuming a PHP web service running on Apache. This works perfectly in the development environment, but in the production environment the code execution hangs somewhere in the Axis library directly after the client has received the SOAP response. I have identified with Wireshark that the only difference from the client perspective is that in development environment the HTTP header of the SOAP Response contains the entryp  precode Connection close codepre  pwhich is missing in production environment. My assumption is that this is the reason the code execution hangs, because Axis is expecting the connection close header field.p  pIs there something I can do to remedy this by configuring the client If not, any hints for configuring Apache  PHP to close the connection correctly are appreciated.p

Negative 522 pI have a div that has its backgroundcolor set to red now, when I press a key in my keyboard, lets say the number 1 key I want it to change color to green, and if i press it again I want it to change back to red. p  pThis is not hard at all using something like jQuery. But in addition to this I want it to do the followingp  pIf i press the same key in my keyboard number 1 for 2 seconds I want it to change color to orange, but I want the color change to be animated like a css3 transition.p  pOn top of this I want to be able to know when the transition is finished so I can change the color to blue.p  pBut If the transition didnt complete i.e. the user didnt press for at least 2 seconds then I want the color to return to the original red.p  pIs this possible using jQuery Or possible at all Any help would be appreciatedp
