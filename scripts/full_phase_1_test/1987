Positive 1987 pI am attempting to load the kernel into memory by writing my own boot loader. Ive been able to successfully load the kernel into memory  I know that because I used the bochs debugger set the breakpoint to 0x7c00 and stepped through and the system does jump into the kernel. The problem is that after jumping into the kernel none of the print statements in kernel.s work. That indicates on the terminal that the kernel has been loaded into memory. p  pHere is the bootblock.s file majority of the relevant code resides at label codebootercodep  precode bootblock.s  Empty boot block file   .equ symbol, expression  These directive set the value of the symbol to the expression     .equ    BOOTSEGMENT,0x07c0     .equ    DISPLAYSEGMENT,0xb800     .equ    KERNELLOCATION, 0x1000     .equ    STACKSP, 0xffff     .equ    STACKSS, 0x0  .text                Code segment .globl    start     The entry point must be global .code16              Real mode   start     MAKE BOOTABLE     .  start  510     .byte  0x55     .byte  0xaa     jmp booter  ossize     Place where createimage writes the OS size     .word 0     .word 0  print   movw  BOOTSEGMENT,ax   movw  ax,ds  printloop   lodsb   cmpb  0,al   je  printdone   movb  14,ah   movl  0x0002,ebx   int  0x10   jmp  printloop printdone   retw   booter      SET UP STACK     Allocating the stack     movw STACKSS, ax     movw ax, ss     movw STACKSP, sp      movl allocating, esi     call print      movl done, esi     call print      Resetting the disk drive, setting dl and calling int 0x13     movb 0x0, ah     movb 0x0, dl     int 0x13      movl bootblocktest, esi     call print     movl hellostring, esi     call print      LOAD KERNEL     movl loadingkernel, esi     call print      Number of sectors to read     movb 0x24, al     movb 0x80, al     movb 0x08, al       movb 0x02, ah     track number     movb 0x00, ch      which sector to read from sector 2 where kernel should be     movb 0x02, cl      set up head number     movb 0x0, dh      Set the drive number to 0x0 floppy     movb 0x0, dl      Time to set esbx to read from the correct place 01000     movw 0x0100, bx     movw bx, es     movw 0x0, bx     movw 0x0, ax      Setting ah  2 and calling int 0x13 read sector      int 0x13      movl done, esi     call print      Booting up at 0x07c0     movw BOOTSEGMENT, ax     movw ax, ds     movl bootmessage, esi     call print       dhch control head numbers, setting them to 0     movb 0x0, dh     movb 0x0, ch      movw ds,       INVOKE KERNEL      Kernel jump     movl readymessage, esi     call print      Setting ds  0x7c0     movw 0x0100, ax     movw ax, ds      Time to set esbx to read from the correct place 01000     movw 0x0100, bx     movw bx, es     movw 0x0, bx       movl 0x1000, ax     jmp ax     mov 0x0, ax      If any errors, message will be displayed here     movl errormessage, esi     call print   forever     jmp forever   Error handling error     movl errormessage, esi     call print   messages mystring     .asciz  test.nr bootblocktest   .asciz nBootblock Testnr hellostring     .asciz  How are you todaynr myname .asciz Welcomenr loadingkernel .asciz Loading Kernel...nr done .asciz Donenr bootmessage     .asciz Booting up...nr readymessage     .asciz Sliding into yo Kernel like... nr errormessage     .asciz Something went terribly wrong...nr rebootmessage     .asciz Press any key to reboot the OSnr allocating .asciz Allocating Stack...nr codepre  pHere is the kernel.s filep  precode.data                                Data segment   Some strings  kernel     .asciz  [Kernel]gt  testing     .asciz  Running a trivial test...  works     .asciz  Seems Ok.

Positive 1987 pIve wondered about this for a very long time.p  pI understand that GUI programming is eventdriven. I understand that most GUI programms will feature an event loop which loops through all events on the message queue. I also understand that it does so by calling some kind of Operating System method like getmessage, which will block the thread until a message is received. In this sense, when no events are happening, the thread is sleeping peacefully.p  pMy question, however, is how does the Operating System check for available messagesSomewhere down the stack I assume there must be a loop which is continually checking for new events. Such a loop cannot possibly feature any blocking, because if so, there must be another looping thread which is alwaysawake, ready to wake the first. However, I also appreciate that this cannot be true, because otherwise I would expect to see 100 of at least one processor core in use at all times, checking over and over and over and over....p  pI have considered that perhaps the checking thread has a small sleep between each iteration. This would certainly explain why an idle system isnt using 100 CPU. But then I recalled how events are usually responded to immediately. Take a mouse movement for example the cursor is being constantly redrawn, in sync with the physical movements.p  pIs there something fundamental, perhaps, in CPU architectures that allows threads to be woken at the hardware level, when certain memory addresses change valuep  pIm otherwise out of ideas Could anyone please help to explain whats really happeningp
Positive 1987 pI have very little programming experience but I was wondering if it was at all possible to wipe my jailbroken iPod touch fourth generation and create my own OS for it. I currently have no use for it and would like to be able to use its camera, microphone, speaker, and Bluetooth capabilities in more ways. I would appreciate any feedback at all. I have no clue if it is even possible or how hard it is. Thanks in advance. p  pNathan Andersonp

Positive 1987 pIn the perspective of an RTOS task what does offset and jitter means My understanding is that offset is the maximum time by which the task can be delayed once it is in READY state and jitter is the additional execution time the task takes from the expected value.

Positive 1987 pI am interested to foray into this territory, and reading up on a hrefhttpwiki.osdev.org relnofollowhttpwiki.osdev.orga, I found that people need to have a lot of knowledge on CS theory, discrete mathematics and hardware interfacing to create an OS.p  pMy question, when most people are doing higherlevel and enterprise programming, which, even at their best involve very few or no direct hardwareinterfacing code to be written eg inline assembly and optimization, then how did the first OS creators or maybe even FORTRAN and LISP, when OS did not exist get so much knowledge on how to do whatp
