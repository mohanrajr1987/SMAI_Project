Positive 1381 pI am currently working on understanding the Java concept of multithreading. I went through a tutorial which uses the Tortoise and the Hare example to explain the concept of multithreading, and to a large extent I understood the syntax and the logic of the video tutorial. At the end of the video tutorial, the Youtuber gave an assignment that involves applying Multithreading to an olympic race track. p  pUsing my knowledege from the example, I was able to create 10 threads representing the athletes that run within a loop, that executes 100 times representing 100 meters.p  pMy challenge is that when the Thread scheduler makes an Athlete to get to 100 meters before the other 9 athletes, the remaining 9 threads always do not complete their race. This is not usually the case in a standard race track. The fact that a Thread called Usain Bolts gets to 100 first, does not mean Yohan Blake should stop running if he is at 90m at that time. p  pI am also interested in getting the distance note that they are all using the same variable for each thread, so that I can use a function to return the positions of each Thread at the end of the race.p  pWhat I have done that did not work  1 I have tried to use an if else construct containing nine else  statement to assign the distance of each executing thread to a new integer variable. using the Thread.currentThread.getName property and the name of each thread but that did not work well for me. This was an attempt to give positions to the athletes alone using their distance but does nothing about the 9 athletes not finishing the race.br 2 I have also tried to use an ArrayList to populate the distance at runtime but for some strange reasons this still overwrites the distance each time it wants to add another distance.p  pBelow are my codesp  precodepackage olympics100meters  import java.util.ArrayList  public class HundredMetersTrackRules implements Runnable  public static String winner  public void race  for int distance1distancelt50distance  System.out.printlnDistance covered by Thread.currentThread    .getName   is distance meters.   boolean isRaceWonthis.isRaceWondistance if isRaceWon  ArrayListltIntegergt numbers  new ArrayList numbers.adddistance System.out.printlntesting...numbers break       private boolean isRaceWonint totalDistanceCovered     boolean isRaceWonfalse    if HundredMetersTrackRules.winnernullampamp    totalDistanceCovered50     String winnerNameThread.currentThread.getName    HundredMetersTrackRules.winnerwinnerName    System.out.printlnThe winner is HundredMetersTrackRules.winner    isRaceWontrue         else if HundredMetersTrackRules.winnernull     isRaceWonfalse         else if HundredMetersTrackRules.winnernull     isRaceWontrue        return isRaceWon   public void run  this.race        codepre  pThis is my main method I reduced it to 5 Athletes till I sort out the issuesp  precodepublic class Olympics100Meters      param args the command line arguments    public static void mainString[] args     HundredMetersTrackRules racernew HundredMetersTrackRules    Thread UsainBoltThreadnew Threadracer,UsainBolt    Thread TysonGayThreadnew Thread racer,TysonGay    Thread AsafaPowellThreadnew Threadracer,AsafaPowell    Thread YohanBlakeThreadnew Thread racer,YohanBlake    Thread JustinGatlinThreadnew Thread racer,JustinGatlin     UsainBoltThread.start    TysonGayThread.start    AsafaPowellThread.start    YohanBlakeThread.start    JustinGatlinThread.start     codepre

Negative 1381 pWorking with some code, Im coming across run loops, which Im new to, inside codeNSOperationcodes.p  pThe codeNSOperationcodes are busy downloading data  and whilst they are busy, there is code to wait for the downloads to complete, in the form of codeNSRunLoopcodes and thread sleeping.p  pThis code in particular is of interest to mep  precodewhile aCertainConditionIsTrue ampamp [self isCancelled]NO       if[[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] runMode NSDefaultRunLoopMode beforeDate[NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow1.0]]         [NSThread sleepForTimeInterval1.0]        codepre  pIve read about the run loops, and coderunModebeforeDatecode will wait for an input source or a timeout. Although Im not 100 what counts as an input souce.p  pOn the first execution of this it always returns NO and hits the codesleepForTimeIntervalcode. Is this badp  pIn a particular utility class, its hitting the codesleepForTimeIntervalcode a lot  once for each thread  which significantly hurts the performance.p  pAny better solutions for this, or advicep

Negative 1381 pIm working on a setup that runs a bunch of shell commands on a remote system when triggered. Instead of having a bunch of concatenated strings, for maintainability I decided to use a templater.p  pHandlebarjs has so far proven to be amazing, but by default it html encodes output. Ive learned you can add code noEscape true code to the compile command, or wrap the variable in  , but what Id like to do is for certain templates, replace the default escaper entirely. Is this doablep  pRight now my templates look like codemkdir shellEscape directorycode with noEscape turned on, but Id rather default that behaviour.p  pFailing that, Id like to know if there is a Util function that translates the variable provided to a string You can provide handlebar a function, but a helper doesnt evaluate it firstp
Negative 1381 pIn the following article, Douglas Crockford creates a function to more closely simulate prototypical inheritance in JavaScript a hrefhttpjavascript.crockford.comprototypal.html relnofollowhttpjavascript.crockford.comprototypal.htmla.  I understand the concept.  However, once you create a new object using the function below, how do you then add methods and properties to that object other than using dotsubscript notation.  Either of which, in my opinion, would produce ugly code. p  precodeif typeof Object.create  function      Object.create  function o          function F          F.prototype  o         return new F        newObject  Object.createoldObject codepre  pDo I then need to use the following notationp  precodenewObject.method1  function newObject.cnt  1 ... codepre  pDoes anyone else find this as an ugly way to add properties and methods to an objectp  pI understand I can technically pass in a function, for which I want to set the prototype of, with all the methods and variables. p  pIm more or less trying to understand how Crockford intended for that function to be used.p
Negative 1381 pSorry for the confusing title but I tried to condense it as best I could. To clarify, my company offers a set of products that can be downloaded for free from our website the download comes as a zip file. In our products we include some videos that are currently being hosted on our personal server, however we also have the videos being hosted on Vimeo. To cut down on server traffic and download time the question was asked, Can we just run the video download from Vimeo instead of our own server Well the answer that question is yes, in fact Vimeo if you are a pro member offers different ways of downloading your own personal videos either through their API or a permanent link within the videos settings. I have decided to go the permanent link route, so going through the video settings Vimeo offers 5 different links, each according to the quality desired YAY.p  pMy question, however, is there some way through php or html to create a drop down selection on the download page and depending on which one you select due to bandwidth, etc. the content we offer gets downloaded with the video in the correct file structure of our productp  pLet me clarify, not along side the downloaded zip, put actually inside of it.p  pFor example, say my file structure looks like thisp  precodeProduct     Books folder     Videos folder     Othercontent folder     index.html file codepre  pand the video exists at ProductVideosexample.mp4. The file exists on my server but I would like for the customer to download it from Vimeo instead. Say I have a basic form belowp  precodeltform methodpostgt ltselect namevideoQualitygt     ltoption nameformSelect valueSelectgtSelect...ltoptiongt     ltoption nameformHD1080 valueHD1080gtHigh Definition 1080pltoptiongt     ltoption nameformHD valueHDgtHigh Definitionltoptiongt     ltoption nameformSD valueSDgtStandard Definitionltoptiongt     ltoption nameformMobile valueMobilegtMobileltoptiongt ltselectgt ltbrgtltbrgt ltinput typesubmit nameformSubmit valueDownloadgt ltformgt codepre  pWould there be a way to have the option of the form effect the file that gets downloaded in place of ProductVideosexample.mp4 and not along side it only so the customers dont have to mess with the file tree.p

Negative 1381 pfor a college exercise that Ive already submitted I needed to read a .txt file wich contained a lot of names of images1 in each line.  Then I needed to open each image as an ascii file, and read their dataimages where in ppm format, and do a series of things with them. The things is, I noticed my program was taking 70 of the time in the reading the data from the file part, instead of in the other calculations that I was doing finding number of repetitions of each pixel with a hash table, finding diferents pixels beetween 2 images etc.., which I found quite odd to say the least.p  pThis is how the ppm format looks likep  precodeP3 This value can be ignored when reading the file, because all image will be correctly formatted 4 4 255 This value can be also ignored, will be always 255. 0  0  0    0  0  0    0  0  0   15  0 15 0  0  0    0 15  7    0  0  0    0  0  0 0  0  0    0  0  0    0 15  7    0  0  0 15  0 15    0  0  0    0  0  0    0  0  0 codepre  pThis is how I was reading the data from the filesp  precodeifstream fdatos fdatos.openargv[1] Open file with the name of all the images  const int size  128 char file[size] Where Ill get the image name  Image img while fdatos gtgt file  While theres still images anmes left, continue     ifstream fimagen fimagen.openfile  Open image file img  new Imagefimagen Create new image object with its data file          Rest of the calculations whith that image      delete img Delete image object after done      fimagen.close Close image file after done   fdatos.close codepre  pAnd inside the image object read the data like thisp  precodeconst int tallafirma  100 char firma[tallafirma] fichin gtgt stdsetw100 gtgt firma  Read the P3 part, can be ignored  int maxvalue, numpixels fichin gtgt height gtgt width gtgt maxvalue  Read the next three values numpixels  heightwidth datos  new Pixel[numpixels]  int r,g,b Dont need to be ints, max value is 256, so an unsigned char would be ok. for int i0 iltnumpixels i     fichin gtgt r gtgt g gtgt b    datos[i]  Pixel r, g ,b  This last part is the slow one,  I thing I should be able to read all this data in one single read  to buffer or something which would be stored in an array of unsigned chars,  and  then Id only need to to do buffer[0] gt Pixel 1  Red data buffer[1] gt Pixel 1  Green data buffer[2] gt Pixel 1  Blue data codepre  pSo, any Ideas I think I can improve it quite a bit reading all to an array in one single call, I just dont know how that is done.p  pAlso, is it posible to know how many images will be in the index file Is it posiible to know the number of lines a file hasbecause theres one file name per line..p  pThanksp  pEDIT This is How I emasure the time.p  precodeinclude ltsystime.hgt include ltsysresource.hgt double gettime    struct timeval t   struct timezone tzp   gettimeofdayampt, amptzp   return t.tvsec  t.tvusec1e6   double start  gettime Everything to be measured here. double end  gettime  cout ltlt endstart ltlt endl codepre
Negative 1381 pFor a while now Ive been having difficulty correctly applying textures to three.js custom objects. Specifically extruded elliptical objects. I have looked around and from what I can see I need to generate the objects UV mapping by using its bounding box. However, I am unsure exactly how to do this and I cant seem to find any detailed explanation on how this works. Can anyone help explain this process to me in detailp  pThanks, zaidi92p
