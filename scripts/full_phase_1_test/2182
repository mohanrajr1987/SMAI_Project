Positive 2182 pI have a basic feed setup Im trying to get working. p  pI have page getting an array of items from the DB and looping through them. It then includes a template for the item and in the item I want to populate it from each item that is being looped through. p  pIm running into a problem where the item is not defined in the item template, just in the page where the template is being included. p  pI have seen a couple posts that say the scope of the variable should still be accessible in the item template but Im getting the typical error that the variable is not defined.

Positive 2182 pI am building a simple command line interpreter. It reads user input from stdin and parses it to run programs in seperate child processes.p  pUser input will be in the format   ...  with arg1 to arg4 being possible command line arguments.p  pI am constraining the input format, path is lt100 chars long, each cmd line argument is lt20 chars long, there are up to 4 cmd line argumentsp  pFor now the main function only reads in one line of user input.p  pMy problem is, I abstracted the input parsing and storing into a function called extractArgschar,char. This function parses the input and extracts the data needed for the execvchar argc, char argv[] arguments.p  pIt definitely parses the input correctly. I put debugging print statements in main and extractArgs to print out the strings in the argv array. The one in extractArgs shows that argv holds the correct values, but the one in main prints nonsense.p  pI suspect it has something to do with memory being recycled after extractArgs finishes execution, so the argv pointers end up pointing at nonsense when the old values are overwritten..p  pIs this correct What can I do to stop that Must I use malloc Is there no way to simply keep the pointers in the argv array from being recycledp  precode argv is the char array to store cmd args from stdin for execv,   path is string to store path from user input int extractArgschar argv, char path      const char fmessageNotFound  s not foundn     struct stat buf      const char delim[2]        char argStr[90]     char token     int i      scanfs, path  get path       handle invalid program path     if statpath, ampbuf  1               printffmessageNotFound, path         return 1           argv[0]  path  argv[0] must be program name     argv[1]  NULL  set terminating element for 0 argument case.       read all cmd line args.      constraints up to 4 args, arg lengths lt20 chars     fgetsargStr, 90, stdin     argStr[strcspnargStr, n]  0  clear trailing n       populate argv array     token  strtokargStr,       for i  1 i lt 5 ampamp token  NULL i              argv[i]  token         token  strtokNULL,             set terminating element after populating argv     argv[i]  NULL       test and print all the arguments     i  0     while argv[i]  NULL            EVERYTHING WORKS HERE         printfsn, argv[i]         i           return 0   int main      pidt chpid     char argv[6]   max 4 cmd args  name  NULL terminator     char path[100]  command path length lt100      if extractArgsargv, path  1  invalid path              fgetspath, 100, stdin  clean up newline         return            Print values in argv     int i  0     while argv[i]  NULL            PRINTS NONSENSE.         printfsn, argv[i]         i           chpid  fork     if chpid  0              execvpath, argv          waitNULL     return 0  codepre

Positive 2182 pI am playing building a little address book program. I have three classes codeAddressBookcode, codeContactcode and codeAddresscode. A codetoscode method written in the codeAddresscode class defines the output format of an address and I have written a codeprintaddressescode method in the codeContactcode class which pending on whether the argument passed in is codelongcode or codeshortcode should output one of two output formats as defined in the tos method. When calling codeprintaddresseslongcode on a codeContactcode instance from the codeAddressBookcode class it will only output the codeshortcode format as defined in the codetoscode method.p  pThis is not working as I expected and im pretty sure its fault with my understanding of method and variable scope or explicit and implicit returns, but I cannot discern where I am going wrong.

Negative 2182 pI am trying to update a row in a database. I am uploading data into a temp table through my program and then moving that data to the main table after it has been converted. For example I upload a file into my temp table which has 2 rows First row is Personal ID and the second is shoe brand, with the shoe brand being the primary key. I also have a shoe brand table where say Nike is row 1, Adidas row 2, Reebok row 3 and ShoeBrandName is the name of the column with the name and ShoeBrandID is the ID associated with the name. p  pWhen I upload my data to my temp table it will look like thisp  precode              TEMPTBL  Personal ID              Shoe Brand   123456                    Nike codepre  pBut when I move it to my main table I am using an insert with left outer join and the same data as above in the main table will look like thisp  precode              MAINTBL  Personal ID              ShoeBrand   123456                      1 codepre  pHere is where my problem comes in. Say the user uploads another file with the same Personal ID, and the difference is the shoe brand changes from Nike to Reebok. I would need the main table to update to thisp  precode         MAINTBL After Update   Personal ID              ShoeBrand   123456                      3 codepre  pHere is the code I am trying to runp  precodeUPDATE [MAINTBL] SET [ShoeBrand]  b.[ShoeBrandID]  FROM [TEMPTBL] a left outer join [MAINTBL].tblshoebrand b on a.[Shoe Brand]  b.ShoeBrandName  WHERE [Personal ID]  123456 codepre  pThis code runs, but does nothing..... literally nothing.p  pCan anyone give me some advicep
Negative 2182 pI have an application with a tab activity. The activity hosts 2 activities with a list of items. I have implemented checkboxes to each of the items also. On orientation change, I have set the tab activity to be oriented to the left hand side of the screen. ie. the tab activity and the child activity are recreated. If i press the menu button to display the check boxes and checks a few items and if the orientation is changed, the checked items will not be shown in the check boxes. I handled the display of checkboxes while orientation change using the SharedPreferences.p  pI am putting the checked items to an arraylist. the arraylist cannot be transacted through the SharedPrefereces.  p  pI want the checked items to remain checked on orientation change.p  pDoes anyone have any cluep
