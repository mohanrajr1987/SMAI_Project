Positive 119 pI did something bad, I think. I am a big git noob first of all. By using Eclipse I hope to ignore writing git commands by hand. The issue occurred when I needed to revert changes on a xmlfile so I hoped to checkout original file from local repo. Without reading much about git plugin I just wanted to follow common sense and so I pressed context menu Checkoutbutton under Historytab in Eclipse cannot show you a pic since stackoverflow requires 10 reputation points for posting a pic. After pressing Checkout I pressed Resetbutton and now I am not able to commit changes to local repo even though I can see changed and new files by running git status. If I try running git commit m  I get the msg that there is nothing to commit.p  pPls helpbr Kind regardsbr A.H.p
Positive 119 pI cant figure out what I may be doing differently, but sometimes when Im working on a feature branch say codesomefeaturecode, make some commits, then checkout another branch, say codemastercode, and do a codegit merge somefeaturecode, occasionally it will ask me for a message to merge the branches, but sometimes it just adds the commits to my other branch.p  pI must be doing something differently during each occasion, but for the life of me I cant determine what.p
Positive 119 ol lipI did a codegit pullcode and I got new files after that. pli lipI saw those new files in Changes to be committed list when I did a codegit statuscode. So I did codegit reset HEAD ltnewfilefrompullgtcode for all new files that I got. I ensured with codegit statuscode that I have only my old files are in Changes to be committed list. pli liI did a codegit push origin ltmybranchgtcode and now both the new files which were not under that  Changes to be committed list and my old files which were under  Changes to be committed list  got pushed.

Positive 119 pIm having a problem with Git I cant figure out. I have a simple HTML file in my master branch. On that file, there is a word, mispl1. I have a branch off of master named fixMispl1. I check it out, change mispl1 to misspell1, and commit the change.p  pSo now if I switch to master, in Eclipse I can see mispell1 changed to mispl1, and if I switch back to fixMispl1, I see it change back to mispl1.p  pSo the problem is, Im trying to merge fixMispl1 into master. I switch to master, then type codegit merge fixMispl1code, and nothing happens. I get a message saying Already uptodate. But I know its not up to date, because the word changes every time I switch branches.p
Positive 119 pIm working on a codebase that has a number of different git repos. So, Im playing with submodules to try and organize all of them into one source repo. It looks something like thisp  precodesource    ember    rails codepre  pIm now trying to make a git alias to checkout the same branchname in all of the repos. If I do this by hand, the command looks like this on the command linep  precodegit checkout b ltbranchnamegt git submodule foreach git checkout b ltbranchnamegt codepre  pId like to be able to just typep  precodegit sco b ltbranchnamegt codepre  pand have codescocode expand to the full command.

Negative 119 pIm trying now for a couple of hours to optimize my user interface but Im not getting any further right now.  I got a JTabbedPane to show datasets. There is one textfield in there with should also represent the tabs title. Right now there is a button labeled save which does nothing else but read this text field from the current tab and updates the tabs title. Id love to replace this by updating the tabs title when the field is changed. I got the event listener up and running, so no problems here, but how to I get to call the JTabbedPane object I tried to put a JTabbedPane variable into my JPanel class and store a reference here, but this keeps crashing the moment I call the setter for this variable...

Negative 119 pI have recently discovered codeFlexboxcode when I was looking for a solution to make divs the same hight, depending on the highest one.p  pI have read the a hrefhttpcsstricks.comsnippetscssaguidetoflexboxfollowing pagea on CSStricks.com and it convinced me that codeflexboxcode is a very powerful module to learn and use. However, it also made me think about the fact that Twitter Bootstrap and similar frameworks offer kind of the same functions  of course a lot extra with their grid systems.p  pNow, the questions are What are the pros and cons of codeflexboxcode Is there something one cant do with Flexbox that one can do with a framework like Bootstrap of course purely talking about the grid system Which one is faster when implemented on a websitep  pIm guessing when only for the grid system, its smarter to purely use codeflexboxcode, but what if youre already using a framework, is there something codeflexboxcode can addp  pAre there any reasons to choose codeflexboxcodes grid system over a frameworksp
Negative 119 pI have a really hard time searching for this, because I have no idea how to call it.p  pIll try to describe the process I want, and see if any of you know such an editor. I have a website that has the same html component repeated in them, for example, a menu. I can define how the menu looks with css, but I cant as far as I know add the same piece of html to every html page with a simple line. What I do, is copy the menu over to every place. If I change the menu, I need to do it all again. I know this can be achieved by using a dynamic server, with something like php or jsp, but I dont need it to be dynamic.p  pI was wondering if there was a way to do this. I thought possibly there was an editor, where I can edit html using includes, and then compile the htmls after modification to produce the htmls I will replace on my server.p  pThanksp
