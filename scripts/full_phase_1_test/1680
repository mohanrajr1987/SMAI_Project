Negative 1680 pI am developing an app that displays information such as ascii arts which are very sensitive to font width.

Negative 1680 pI am trying to create a react application which should support i18n.. application should support different languages , currency and date formats.. There should be a dropdown with languages and when I select language, it should translate whole application to that specific language.p  pI have gone through some i18n apis like intl.js and format.js, but I have seen sample translated localeslocaleen.js already present in sample demo they provided.p  pI have confused where these translated locales are generating from, do we need to do it manually or api take care of translating whole application.p  pPlease can anyone suggest me on this. How to make my react application to support some langugesp

Negative 1680 pFrom the a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2faqprogramming.htmlwhataretherulesforlocalandglobalvariablesinpython relnofollowPython FAQa, we can read p  blockquote   pIn Python, variables that are only referenced inside a function are implicitly globalp blockquote  pAnd from the a hrefhttpsdocs.python.org2tutorialcontrolflow.htmldefiningfunctions relnofollowPython Tutorial on defining functionsa, we can read p  blockquote   pThe execution of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the local variables of the function. More precisely, all variable assignments in a function store the value in the local symbol table whereas variable references first look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables of enclosing functions, then in the global symbol table, and finally in the table of builtin namesp blockquote  pNow I perfectly understand the tutorial statements, but then saying that codevariables that are only referenced inside a function are implicitly globalcode seems pretty vague to me.p  pWhy saying that they are implicitly global if we actually start looking at the local symbol tables, and then follow with the more general ones Is it just a way of saying that if youre only going to reference a variable within a function, you dont need to worry if its either local or codeglobalcode p
