Positive 653 pAs I put in title, the question is how does Wix decide to install a particular filep  pSo I have exe file and when I change something in exe file and rebuild it, it will not get reinstalled if I dont change version. But if I change something in resource file, resource file will be replaced even if I dont change version of my application. So how wix is deciding if he need to replace file during upgrade or not.p  pI am using wix3.9. MajorUpgrade is schedule afterInstallFinalize.p

Positive 653 pI am using install shield with visual studio 2013 to create a installer for my project. In the Files option in install shield I am selecting the content files of my project and adding it to the destination folder. After building the project and running the installer file, I see that installation is successful. But the folder structure of the project content files are not copied to the destination location i.e for example say I have dlls inside bin folder then the installer is directly copying all the dlls in to the main destination path rather than keeping them in bin files, and same with all the other folders in content files. Can anyone please helpp

Positive 653 h2Backgroundh2  pIm currently triaging migrating an existing nonMSI setup to a Windows Installer based solution. The current solution is written in a hrefhttpwww.jrsoftware.orgisinfo.php relnofollowInnoSetupa and I very much like it, however, customer IT departments start to require MSI, and where they do so, it is often the case, that manysome of the prerequisites and scripts we include in our setup.exe are not needed for their automated tasks but, then, some are.p  pTherefore it seems a pure MSI wrapper doesnt make too much sense here, so Im looking at multiple MSI files plus a boostrapper.p  h2Prior knowledgeh2  pIm good an InnoSetup, but Im just starting to a hrefhttpswww.firegiant.comwixtutorial relnofollowreada a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclick1590592972 relnofollowintoa the Windows Installer technology.p  h2Questionh2  pAs far as I can tell, for any multistep  complicated setup requirements including prerequisites and stuff, using just a bare MSI file is a nogo. As evidenced by the existence of all the different boostrappers, including the one bundled with WiX, a hrefhttpwixtoolset.orgdocumentationmanualv3bundle relnofollowBurnap  pTherefore, I would need to split our existing monolithic setup into several steps, some of which mostly those that install emourem files bundled into MSI databases and some of the steps just scripted in the bootstrapper.p  pAnd here is where I really could use some prior experience regarding setup packages What parts of a chained setup go into the MSI packages and what part goes into the bootstrapperp  pShould all the normally visible UI reside in the bootstrapper or do you put some of it into the MSI files p  pHow dumb should each MSI file ultimately be That is, if using a bootstrapper and multiple MSI files anyway, should any individual MSI file contain any optional parts, or should all the options be factored out into separate MSI files that just check for the existence of their respective prerequisites, but contain no logic to install themp  hr  pBasically, the application suite needs to support a clickthrough average user scenario where the setup handles emeverythingem and for corporate clients needs to be able to be split up into MSI files that only contain our stuff minus dependencies like the .NET runtime, SQL Server, ... thatll be handled by the clients corporate it and our software MSIs will be deployed by the client IT automagically.p  pSp should a the glue and dependency scripting go into the bootstrapper and only use very simple MSI files Or should some logic go into some MSI filesp
Negative 653 pI have a Rails 3 application which use PostgreSQL 9.1 as a database. We use RSpec and FactoryGirl for testing. p  pThe data model has lots of models in 1tomany or manytomany relationships, and those constraints are encoded in the Rails models using hasmany, belongsto, hasmany through, et cetera. We have code which looks something likep  precodeclass User lt ActiveRecordBase    attraccessible name    hasmany phones end  class Phone lt ActiveRecordBase    attraccessible number, userid    belongsto user end codepre  pThe schema in PostgreSQL looks some thing like thisp  precodeCREATE TABLE users id integer, name VARCHAR20 CREATE TABLE phones id integer, number VARCHAR20, userid integer codepre  pHowever, I prefer to encode the data constraints in the database using foreign key constraints instead of only in the model. To do this, I created a Rails migration and added the foreign key constraints doing something likep  precodesql  ALTER TABLE phones ADD CONSTRAINT phonesuserid FOREIGN KEY userid REFERENCES users id ON DELETE RESTRICT ActiveRecordBase.connection.executesql codepre  pWhen I added foreign key constraints, and started the application in development mode, the database enforced the constraints, and I wasnt able to delete a user if it had any dependent phones. And this held true whether I was in the psql PostgreSQL console or the IRB Rails console. p  pHowever, when I tried writing a RSpec test to see if the foreign key was enforcing delete restrictions, the test failed and I was able to delete a user with dependent phones. Apparently, rake dbtestprepare does not prepare databases with foreign keys. p  pIs there a way I can run my RSpec test suite against a database which enforces foreign key constraintsp
Negative 653 pI was studying about fail fast and fail safe iterators and I had this question in mind. I am not sure if my understanding is correct. p  pVector is synchronized thread safe collection object in Java. So when I try to get the iterator of vector it is a fail fast iterators which means . . When I use this iterator on vector object and any changes made to the vector it will throw ConcurrentModificationExeption. But since vector is thread safe it should be provided with fail safe iterators.p  pWhy is not the case in Java with vector. Where as with concurrentHashMap it is provided with thread safe iterators.p

Negative 653 pI have implemented an import functionality which takes data from a csv file in an Asp.Net appication. The file of the size can vary from a few kbs to a max of 10 MB.p  pHowever when an import occurs and if the file size is  50000 it takes around 20 MINS . Which is way too much of a time. I need to perform an import for around 300000 records within a timespan of 23 Mins . p  pI know that the import to a database also depends on the physical memory of the db server .I create insert scripts in bulk and execute . I also know using SqlBulkCopy would also be another option but in my case its just not the inserting of products that take place but also update and delete that is a field called FUNCTION CODE which decides whether to Insert,Update Or Delete. p  pAny suggestions regarding as to how to go about this would be greatly appreciated.p  pOne approach towards this would be to implement multiple threads which carry out processes simultaneosly ,but i have never implemented threading till date and hence am not aware of the complication i would incur by implementing the same.p  pThanks amp Regards, Francis P.p
