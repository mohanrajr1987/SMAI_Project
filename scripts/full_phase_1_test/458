Positive 458 pI am testing my application using Espresso.p  pMy application uses a communication service to download the database on first access, but I can not do it when the tests are running.p  pMy suggestion on this is to create a database with the data I need for application to run correctly.p  pWell, how can I do itp

Negative 458 pI am trying to work on a new game project where I will include multiple levels. I was reading this question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions21777548spritekitdefiningthevariablesformultiplescenesSprite Kit  Defining the variables for multiple scenesa about the best way to do multiples scenes with as little duplicate code as possible. The answer of course is subclassing.p  pSo say I create my baseScene which is a subclass of SKScene. Here, as suggested, I should put all the relevant code player, objects, collisions bit masks, touches began functions etc that will be shared across all subclass level scenes.  I used the usual did moveToView function in baseScene to add the content and it works perfect across multiple scenes level1Scene, level2Scene etc that are all subclasses of baseScene. Same goes for touches began functions and so on, so no problem with that.p  pMy issue now however is that in my level1Scene I cannot for the life of me figure out how to add stuff thats on top of what is in baseScene such as level 1 enemies, obstacles or backgrounds.  I cannot use didMoveToView since its an override function and will remove everything I have added in my baseScene superclass.p  pI would appreciate any support and my apologises if this is a basic and probably stupid question but I am fairly new to swift, especially scene subclassing.p

Negative 458 pIn Java, is there any way to view the complete, untruncated stack trace e.g. by increasing the number of frames recorded, or otherwise get at the embottomem of a stack trace  Normally the stack trace is truncated from the top at 1024 frames worth, but for a stack overflow problem this is fairly worthless as you really need to see who made the call that triggered the recursion, down near the bottom.  Much better would truncation in the emmiddleem of the stack, but evidently Suns JVM isnt smart enough to do this.p  pPerhaps even some special Sunspecific flags  I tried reducing the stack size to the minimum allowable Xss1000 but thats still more than 1024 frames worth.p  pIn my case, Im trying to debug a stack overflow that occurs in a Hadoop mapper, but only when running on really large input.  I assume the problem comes because a recursive operation Scalas codefoldRightcode is being done on a really, really large linked list, and I need to rewrite it nonrecursively ...  but I need to know who made the call to codefoldRightcode.  This is a basic routine called directly and indirectly in a lot of places and theres lots and lots of code out there that Im working with, so this is highly nonobvious.p
