Positive 1435 pI am running on iOS 9, XCode 7 GM. I have a class that extends UITextField CustomOffsetTextField and provides support for custom text positioning like sop  precodeoverride func textRectForBoundsbounds CGRect gt CGRect      return CGRectOffsetbounds, textOffset.x  leftViewOffset, textOffset.y   override func placeholderRectForBoundsbounds CGRect gt CGRect      return CGRectOffsetbounds, textOffset.x  leftViewOffset, textOffset.y   override func editingRectForBoundsbounds CGRect gt CGRect      return CGRectOffsetbounds, textOffset.x  leftViewOffset, textOffset.y  codepre  pleftViewOffset is the width of the text fields leftView, if one exists. textOffset is a CGPoint that defines custom x and y offsets to apply to the text rects.p  pMy issue is occurring on my sign in view. I have 2 instances of my CustomOffsetTextField  one for the users email and one for their password.p  pOn first load of the view controller, if I enter text into one field and then tap into the other field, that text will jump back to position 0,0 in its text field briefly before jumping back to the position that is defined by textRectForBounds. Some basic print debugging verifies that these functions are always returning the values that I expect them to.p  pAfter this initial hiccup, the text field then behaves as I would expect it to. This issue only occurs one time in each text field after the view controller loads. After that, I can tap back and forth between the fields as much as I want without it happening again.p  pHas anyone seen similar issues with UITextField in iOS 9 If so, were you able to find a fixp
Positive 1435 pI have an issue that I dont know how to resolve. I have a detail view where we have a comments view above the keyboard. We are using notifications to track when the keyboard gets hidden or shown, and that works great. We have done this by making a codeNSLayoutConstraintcode that we apply to the height between the bottom of the view and the comments view. Then when the keyboard is shown or hidden, this constraints height is changed. p  pThe issue now is that we want it to be more interactive so that the user can hide the keyboard much easier. p  pThis is what it looks like beforep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comDFiFA.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDFiFA.png altenter image description hereap  pAnd this is what it looks like when the user is slowly dismissing the keyboard.  a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comHfbcX.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comHfbcX.png altenter image description hereap  pI have tried to track the scrolling of the tableview, but the height of the view doesnt seem to change even if I clearly can see that its changing.p  pI also had a look at this one  a hrefhttpwww.krisdigital.comimessagestylekeyboardios8 relnofollowhttpwww.krisdigital.comimessagestylekeyboardios8a but without any luck. p  pCheersp

Positive 1435 pI have a viewController with 3 different search bars on it and a button next to each search bar.  The three search bars are for different categoriesie Movies, TV Shows and when you press the button next to it its suppose to find an item at random based on what was entered in the search field.

This app sends ping to the server when the keep alive timeout handler fires and the server replies with pong. I also created a simple test server that does nothing more than let clients connect, send ping to a client when I send sendping to it via telnet and responds to ping with the message pong.  p  pa hrefhttppastebin.comt50RUXbF relnofollowHere is my client codea  p  pWhat I expect is the following  p  ul lipStarting the app and signing in should create a persistent connection to the server works  pli lipTelnetting into the server and typing sendping makes the server send ping to the client and the client should send pong back works  pli lipPutting the device in standby should have no effect on the above pingpong mechanism doesnt work  pli lipPutting the device in standby and unlocking it after a few hours, then sending a ping to it should make the client send a pong back works  pli lipTurning off wifi on the client without cellular enabled should be detected on the serverside and kill the socket doesnt work  pli ul  pI log all messages from the server in a textview on the client with a timestamp, and sometimes when I put the device in standby the pings I send from the server just dont arrive at all. Sometimes it takes over a minute for the app to receive the ping message, sometimes it responds immediately. I dont understand why it is so random. Sometimes this undesired behaviour starts after mere minutes in standby mode, sometimes it goes alright for a while but breaks after 20 minutes, sometimes all messages from the server arrive at once as soon as I unlock the device.  p  pPush notifications and voip push notifications could be a solution, but they are also slightly unreliable. There should be a way to make this work 100 of the time.p

Negative 1435 pI have written a really simply forum to integrate into a web app as I was struggling to find a lightweight and quick forum which allowed me to use my own authentication methods to decide who was or wasnt a valid users and which fitted into my application theme. Users are asking for the ability to subscribe to threads so they are notified of replies  what is the best way of doing thisp  pI could create a threads subscriptions table and enter a new row each time someone subscribes  this could involve lots of lookups for busy threads on every post and reply but would be pretty quick on new subscriptions with only one simple insert.p  pThe other option I thought of was to have row per thread and to have a field where I can add or read from an array per thread which contains all the subscribed user ids. This strikes me as quicker for reading as there are less database calls i.e. when a new reply has been made only one database call is needed to get all the user ids but I think it might be slower for inserts when a new subscriber is added as I would have to find the row for the thread, get the existing array and then add the user id to the existing array.p  pA final option, very similar to the second one, would be to have a user subscription table where each row is a user id and then have an array of subscribed threads.p  pWhich would be the best way At the moment my only requirement is to email users on new posts and replies but in the future I may want to expand it to include the ability for users to list their subscribed threads etc like many mainstream forums do.p

Negative 1435 pI have a couple of time been caught out putting function code in NSAssert or NSParameter assert, likep  precodeNSParameterAssert [self doSomeWork]  codepre  pThe problem with this is when you do a release build not only does the code that does an abort if the test fails get omitted from the code, but my code within the  is also omitted also.p  pObviously this fix is simple but to me it still this seems wrong, the logic of the code is changed between test build and release build.p  pI should make it clear I only use this pattern for situation where if the assert fail it is a programmer error.p
Negative 1435 pIm not sure if this would be possible using sqlite or some other method of saving, but how would one save a custom object in a cocos2dx game Can you serialize it and store in the an sqlite database and then unserialize when you want to read the data Is that efficient enoughp  pIm looking for pointers on how to do this. I created a game using Sprite Kit and saving using the NSCoding protocol which was very nice. Not sure if there is something similar in Cocos2dx, but doesnt look like it. Anyways, any help is appreciatedp
Negative 1435 pI have a data frame codedfcode that has two columns, strongtermstrong and strongfrequencystrong. I also have a list of terms with given IDs stored in a vector called codeindicescode. To illustrate these two info, I have the followingp  precodegt headindices    Term 1    hello 256  i 33   the codepre  pAlso, for the data frame.p  precodegt headdf    Term  Freq 1  i     24 2  hello 12 3  the   28 codepre  pI want to add a column in codedfcode called codeTermIDcode which will just be the index of the term in the vector codeindicescode. I have tried using codedplyrmutatecode but to no avail. Here is my code belowp  precodelibrarydplyr  whichindex lt functionterm               ind lt whichindices  as.characterterm               ind  mutatedf, TermID  whichindexTerm codepre  pWhat I am getting as output is a codedfcode that has a new column called codeTermIDcode, but all the values for codeTermIDcode are the same. p  pCan someone help me figure out what I am doing wrong It would be nice as well if you can recommend a more efficient algorithm to do this in [R]. I have implemented this in Python and I have not encountered such issues.p  pThanks in advance.p
