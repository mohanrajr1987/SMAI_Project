Negative 3556 pI am creating a Netty Client which sends HTTP request to POST data to server.To increase the performance what i did was using Keep alive Http requesti know that in HTTP 1.1 all requests are keep alive by default, so i am making sure that Connection header is not set to close while sending the Http request so that it uses the same channel to send the Http Request. Now when i send the Http request to the correct URL,i.e. if i get HttpResponse Status OK in return from server, i am able to send the next Http Request properly but when i send the Http Request for which i get BAD REQUEST or  SERVICE UNAVAILABLE or something other than OK then i am unable to send the next request that is the channel future f.success returned after calling channel.writerequest is false.

Negative 3556 pI need to develop a POC .NET, C, ASP.NET.... The application should create WebPages dynamically from domain objects.

Negative 3556 pI have a pretty large social network type site I have working on for about 2 years high traffic and 100s of files  I have been experimenting for the last couple years with tweaking things for max performance for the traffic and I have learned a lot.  Now I have a huge task, I am planning to completely recode my social network so I am redesigning mysql DBs and everything.  p  pBelow is a photo I made up of a couple mysql tables that I have a question about.  I currently have the login table which is used in the login process, once a user is logged into the site they very rarely need to hit the table again unless editing a email or password.  I then have a user table which is basicly the users settings and profile data for the site.  This is where I have questions, should it be better performance to split the user table into smaller tables  For example if you view the user table you will see several fields that I have marked as setting should I just create a seperate setting table  I also have fields marked with count which could be total count of comments, photos, friends, mail messages, etc. So should I create another table to store just the total count of things  p  pThe reason I have them all on 1 table now is because I was thinking maybe it would be better if I could cut down on mysql queries, instead of hitting 3 tables to get information on every page load I could hit 1.  p  pSorry if this is confusing, and thanks for any tips.  p  pimg srchttpimg2.pict.comb0576322811100800dbtable.jpg altalt textp
Negative 3556 pWe need ADT having search and rank features. That is, in addition to the interface of STL map, a function int getrankkey is required.p  pStandard implementation of such function requires supporting and updating an extra integer field in every node of selfbalanced searching tree e.g., in blackred tree, used in STL mapset. But it seems, STL mapset do not do this.p  pWere looking for a solution based on standard containers STL, Boost having the best possible Time Complexity   findingaddingerasing an element take Olog n like in STL mapset,    computing the rank by a key takes also Olog n.p  pBy the rank of an element, we mean the position of the element in the sorted sequence of all the elements of the mapset.p  pExample.   set  0, 4, 6, 7, 8   rank01, rank42, rank63, rank74, rank85.p  pIn our opinion, under Time Complexity constrains above, the problem cannot be solved by a combination of two maps one sorting by key and other sorting by rank.p  pThanks.p
