Positive 1177 pIm using a progress bar for a timer in my game and I set it to go from 100 to 0 over 15 or so seconds. However, during testing since I have two open two tabs to simulate two clients Ive noticed that the progress bar will only begin animating in each tab once that tab is activated for the first time.p  pNow this emprobablyem wont be a problem in the actual game because all clients will obviously be tabbed in if theyre playing but this may not always be the case because some people switch to different tabs while playing games and I dont want their timer to get out of sync. Specifically if I do something like thisp  precodeprogressTimer.css transitionduration  15s  progressTimer.csswidth, 0 codepre  pThis sets it to drain from its current percent 100 to 0 over 15 seconds, but doesnt take effect until after the user tabs in to see it for the first time and if the user tabs out again it will similarly freeze because when you tab back in you can see it jump instantly. As a result if someone tabs in immediately and another person waits 5 seconds to see it, then the second persons timer will be 5 seconds behind.p  pThis is most likely done for performance reasons as theres no need to animate things like this which cannot be seen but considering my app is not very intensive as is and will have this one progress bar, Id like it always to be running, even if the user is not tabbed in. Is there any way to disable this probable browser featurep
Positive 1177 pI am currently stuck trying to figure out how to correct execute a few loops for my program in order to get it to function as I want.p  pLittle background on the program, I have a List of Names, a List of Dictionaries, and a Dictionary. The goal is to compare the List of Dictionaries to the Dictionary to get the correct values. What i mean by this is lets say I have a group of animals This is the List of Names, Lets call it codesetNamescode and each one of these animals codesetNamescode has a different House, Food, Water, and Bed. This is the list of dictionaries lets call it codesetDatacode. And finally we have the correct value for each one of these dictionaries codesetDatacode. Well call this codecorrectparameterscode . p  pSince each animals has his own dictionary he has to make sure he has the correct parameter for his own dictionary.p  pThe program does the following.p  ol liFirst, it will emfixem our List of Dictionaries codesetDatacode to allow us to compare it later with our codecorrectparameterscodeli liThen, once our codesetDatacode is splitstriped it will begin a loop process to loop through each animal in our codesetNamescode list.li liFinally, once its finished looping it will create a tab for each individual animal with their parameters that were incorrect when compared.li ol  pVisual Example p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com9i5u4.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com9i5u4.png altLoopTab Exampleap  pTo explain the image a bit more, We have our codesetNamescode, codesetDatacode, and codeCorrectparameterscode As we see, the codesetDatacode is compared to the codecorrectparameterscode and anything that is incorrect or does NOT match is printed onto the tab.p  pIssuep  pMy issue is that a tab gets created for every single parameter in the Incorrect data p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comTCmOM.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comTCmOM.png altTabsap  pIm fairly new to python and i am still trying to figure out how to correct loop this function. any ideasp  pCode p  precodefrom PyQt4 import QtCore, QtGui  class WindowQtGui.QWidget     def initself, parent  None         superWindow, self.initparent           Create a QTabWidget where all the tabs will be held         self.myTabs  QtGui.QTabWidget            Loop through our animal names         setNames  [Cat, Dog, Bird]         setData  [House15 House15, Food2 Food2, Water4 Water4, Bed6 Bed6, House14 House14, Food2 Food2, Water5 Water5, Bed6 Bed6, House15 House15, Food8 Food8, Water4 Water4, Bed9 Bed9]         lst  setData         for idx, val in enumeratelst             o               for k,v in val.iteritems                 if  in k                     k  k.split[0]                 if  in v                     v  v.split[1]                     v  v.replace,                     v  v.strip                 o[k]  v             lst[idx]  o         count  0         print lst         correctparameter  House 15, Food 12, Water 4, Bed 4         while count lt lensetNames             for number, item in enumeratelst,0                 for tabName in setNames                     for param, correct in correctparameter.items                         tabLabel  QtGui.QTextEdit                         tabWidget  QtGui.QWidget                         self.myTabs.addTabtabWidget, tabName                         if item.getparam  correct                             tabLabel.append  .formatparam, item.getparam                              Set the tab widgets layout                             tabLayout  QtGui.QVBoxLayout                             tabLayout.addWidgettabLabel                             tabWidget.setLayouttabLayout                         QtGui.QApplication.processEvents                         count  1            Set the main layout         mainLayout  QtGui.QVBoxLayout         mainLayout.addWidgetself.myTabs         self.setLayoutmainLayout           Resize our window and show it         self.resize300, 300         self.show   import sys if name  main     app  QtGui.QApplicationsys.argv     mainwindow  Window     QtGui.QApplication.processEvents     mainwindow.show     sys.exitapp.exec codepre
