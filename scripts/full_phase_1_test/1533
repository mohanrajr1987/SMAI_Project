Positive 1533 pIm trying to work with TrotiNet to override some of the virtual methods defined in the delegate. There is an example of whats happening in a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26912226trotinetunderstandingthecodethis posta, but its unclear to me how I could go about changing the override methods from the class that ultimately calls Server.Start.p  pAlternatively, Id like to be able to pass an object into this class so I can defer to properties within it to change what I do in these methods dynamically. Take a hrefhttpsgithub.comkrysgTrotiNetblobmasterExampleRedirectingProxy.cs relnofollowthis examplea from the GitHub repo. It looks for wikipedia.org in the URI, then makes changes, but what if I wanted to look for google.com instead or anything else How could I either modify this method externally or pass in a value to this class that contains what Id like to have happen when this virtual method executesp

Positive 1533 pA a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comvideoswwdc2015id408 relnofollowWWDC 2015 session videoa describes the idea of strongProtocolOriented Programmingstrong, and I want to adopt this technique in my future apps. Ive been playing around with Swift 2.0 for the last couple of days in order to understand this new approach, and am stuck at trying to make it work with the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosreferencelibraryGettingStartedRoadMapiOSDesignPatterns.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40011343CH5SW4 relnofollowDelegate Patterna.p  pI have two protocols that define the basic structure of the interesting part of my project the example code is nonsense but describes the problemp  p1 A strongdelegation protocolstrong that makes accessible some information, similar to UITableViewControllers emdataSourceem protocolp  precodeprotocol ValueProvider      var value Int  get   codepre  p2 An stronginterface protocolstrong of the entity that does something with the information from above heres where the idea of a ProtocolFirst approach comes into playp  precodeprotocol DataProcessor      var provider ValueProvider  get      func process gt Int  codepre  pRegarding the actual implementation of the data processor, I can now choose between enums, structs, and classes. There are several different abstraction levels of how I want to process the information, therefore classes appear to fit best however I dont want to make this an ultimate decision, as it might change in future use cases. I can define a base processor class, on top of which I can build several casespecific processors not possible with structs and enumsp  precodeclass BaseDataProcessor DataProcessor      let provider ValueProvider      initprovider ValueProvider          self.provider  provider           func process gt Int          return provider.value  100        class SpecificDataProcessor BaseDataProcessor      override func process gt Int          return super.process  200       codepre  pUp to here everything works like a charm. However, in reality the specific data processors are tightly bound to the values that are processed as opposed to the base processor, for which this is emnotem true, such that I want to integrate the emValueProviderem directly into the subclass for comparison often, UITableViewControllers are their own dataSource and delegate.p  pFirst I thought of adding a protocol extension with a default implementationp  precodeextension DataProcessor where Self ValueProvider      var provider ValueProvider  return self   codepre  pThis would probably work if I did not have the BaseDataProcessor class that I dont want to make valuebound. However, subclasses that inherit from BaseDataProcessor emandem adopt ValueProvider seem to override that implementation internally, so this is not an option.p  pI continued experimenting and ended up with thisp  precodeclass BaseDataProcessor DataProcessor       Yes, thats ugly, but I need this var construct so I can override it later     private var provider ValueProvider     var provider ValueProvider  return provider       func process gt Int          return provider.value  10        class SpecificDataProcessor BaseDataProcessor, ValueProvider      let value  1234      override var provider ValueProvider  return self       override func process gt Int          return super.process  100       codepre  pWhich compiles and at first glance appears to do what I want. However, this is not a solution as it produces a reference cycle, which can be seen in a Swift playgroundp  precodeweak var p SpecificDataProcessor autoreleasepool      p  SpecificDataProcessor     p.process  p  lt not nil, hence reference cycle codepre  pAnother option might be to add class constraints to the protocol definitions. However, this would break the POP approach as I understand it.p  pConcluding, I think my question boils down to the following strongHow do you make Protocol Oriented Programming and the Delegate Pattern work together without restricting yourself to class constraints during protocol designstrongp

Negative 1533 pIm trying to make a full duplex pipe, its a piece of my home work i tell beforehand. The scope of the homework is much much larger than this pipe, I just need it done so I could go on with the work. I paste here only the code that matters, i didnt paste the whole code.p  precodedefine READEND 0 define WRITEEND 1  int main      Folder curFolder  Folder malloc sizeofFolder     assertcurFolder  NULL      initFoldercurFolder, NULL, root     makeDircurFolder, test      return 0   Pipe createPipe      Pipe p  Pipe malloc sizeofPipe     assertp  NULL      pipe pgtreadPipe      pipe pgtwritePipe       close pgtreadPipe[WRITEEND]      close pgtwritePipe[READEND]       return p   char readMsgFolderRef folderHandle, char buffer      readfolderHandlegtpipegtreadPipe[READEND], buffer, PIPEBUF      return buffer   void sendMsgFolderRef folderHandle, char msg      writefolderHandlegtpipegtwritePipe[WRITEEND], msg, strlenmsg  1   void makeDirFolder curFolder, char name      pidt childId     char msg[PIPEBUF]     Pipe con  createPipe      childId  fork      switch  childId               case 1  error occurred                      printf Error at fork in function makeDir.n              exit 0                   case 0  son process                      initFolder curFolder, getFolderHandle getppid, con,  , name              readMsgcurFoldergtparentFolder, msg             printfsn, msg             sendMsgcurFoldergtparentFolder, roger roger             break                  default                      insertFolderampcurFoldergtfolderList, getFolderHandlechildId, con, name             sendMsgcurFoldergtfolderListgtfolder, test             readMsgcurFoldergtfolderListgtfolder, msg             printfsn, msg             break                codepre  pthe result for now should be output on the screen test roger rogerp  phowever I cant get it done. I seem to miss some little detail.p
