Positive 137 pI want to add support for generics to a language, but before I do I need to understand more clearly what generics are inside.p  pMy current understanding is that instantiating the classp  precodeclass ArrayListltTgt      public int addT object               ...       codepre  pCreates an instance where the argument type of codeTcode on codeaddcode must be the same as the type argument on codenew ArrayListltTgtcode where codeTcode is a real type.p  pImplementing this seems pretty simple, but only for this usecase.  It becomes a more complicated concept when it needs to support introspection.  For example, I strongwouldntstrong say thatp  precodetrue  new ArrayListltDategt instanceof ArrayList codepre  pbut I would say thatp  precodetrue  new ArrayListltDategt instanceof ArrayListltDategt codepre  pMy question is, when using codeArrayListltDategtcode as a type reference, is it a type derived of codeArrayListltTgtcode, or is it a class in its own right, for example isp  precodelist  new ArrayListltDategt codepre  pan instance ofp  precodeclass ArrayList      public int addDate object               ...       codepre  pOr is it an instance of codeArrayListltTgtcode where codeTcode is codeDatecodep

Positive 137 pIm a programmer new to Java. Based on what Ive read on OOP, I understand that you shouldnt code in a way that you have to rewrite everything to change something. Ive always tried to apply design patterns, refactoring etc. and I was actually excited about the potential fixability.p  pThen came my first major change I decided to implement GLES instead of using canvas for drawing operations. Unfortunately, GLES required a lot more steps for drawing, e.g. preloading of textures. As a result, I couldnt just reimplement existing interfaces that defined most of my apps methods I had to touch every single class in my app.p  pI guess my question is, would this be a case of incorrect employment of OOP, a situation that OOP couldnt have averted, i.e. I didnt make the right choices at the start, or perhaps an Android thing If it is something Im doing wrong, some example solutions would be a great help. Thanksp
