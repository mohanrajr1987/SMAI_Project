Positive 1074 pI run a SonarQube server on an Ubuntu 14.04. From the servers machine, there is no problem accessing to SonarQube web, but from my machine I cannot.p  pI looked at access.log and sonar.log but there is nothing about my access. On configuration of sonar  sonar.properties  I tried some different configurations for sonar.web.host, I tried to leave it commented, set it with 0.0.0.0, 127.0.0.1, and my public IP for sonar.web.port I tried to set it on 80, 9000 and 8080 and for sonar.web.context, I have it set to sonar.p  pThe ports are open because I installed an apache server and I can access to it without any problem.p  pDo you have some idea about whats happeningp  pThank youp

Positive 1074 pI have created a Python script for the Raspberry Pi that loops and sends out new colors of LED lights to the GPIO pins to set the and RGB strip. I have several modes of colors that I can choose between, and I choose by hitting a key on my keyboard 1, 2, 3, etc. However, I dont want to have to always run and control the script through the terminal. I want to transfer this to a webpage that I can access from my own computer and click buttons to start the script.p  pI have figured out how to do all of this, but I am stuck with the vital part of my script. I would like to be able to click buttons that tell the script to change modes and then have an Exit button that clears the GPIO pin outputs, closes all the libraries that are running and then exits the script. Therefore, I cannot simply kill the old process and start a new one each time I want to change the mode, unless there is a way for me to do all of the clearing actions as well.p  pTLDR How would I go about sending a signal to the python script, equivalent to getting a key press through the terminal, which I can then listen for and change mode or quit as neededp
Positive 1074 pI am planning to make some microcontroller boards which would do miscellaneous tasks. For example measuring analog voltages or controlling other instruments. Each board needs to be controlleddownloaded its data from one place. For that purpose I would use an ethernet interface and do the comnunication over that. So my question is which would be the most suitable method of achieving that. My ideas are run a webserver on each module and communicate with POSTGET, or run a telnet server on boards and communicate with a telnet client. The security and speedlatency is not an concern but the data integrity is. I dont need a html based gui for modules because I will implement an application which will communicate wizh the modules periodically, gets the data from them and stores in a database. And the database is what I will use later, for examining the data for example.  An other example I have a board which measures measures temperature. There is a server on the board itself run by the mcu. It is connected to a router via the ENC chip. I have my pc also connected to that router. I have an application which connects to the server run by the Atmega328 and collects the data then stores to a database. It repeats this lets say in every hour. I would use an Atmega328 and an ENC28J60 ethernet interface chip. What do you recommendp
