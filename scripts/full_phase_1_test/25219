Positive 25219 pI am currently working my way through the codeUdacitycode iOS Development Nanaodegree and have come up against a problem that I am really struggling to solve. I am new to development, and Stackoverflow, so this is my first post.... here it goesp  pI am building an app used to generate Memes. It does that by allowing a user to pick an image and enter some text.p  pI have a codeUIViewcode. In that codeUIViewcode I have 2x codeUIToolbarcode, 2x codeUITextFieldcode and a codeUIImageViewcode. The toolbars are positioned at the top and bottom of the view, the text fields beneath and above them respectively. The codeUIImageViewcode space the full with and height of the view, and is underneath the toolbars and textInputs.p  pSee here for a hrefhttpsdrive.google.comfiled0BVyqP0WP7X9YTNGQWNVLWg3VWcviewuspsharing relnofollowscreenshots of Storyboard and appap  pThe user is able to select an image from their Album, or take a photo with their camera, to populate the codeUIImageViewcode. The codeUIImageViewcode is then set to codeAspect Fitcode to keep its correct aspect ratio. p  pI have setup constraints in Interface Builder so that the codeUITextFieldscode are positioned at a constant distance to the top and bottom toolbars. p  pThe problem I have is that the user needs to rotate the device to position the text fields so that they are positioned on the top and bottom of the image. What I mean by this is that if the user selects a landscape image, and the device is in portrait, the user would need to rotate their device to ensure that the text fields are positioned on top of the image.p  pWhat I would like to do is reposition the textFields after the user has selected or taken an image and the image has had Aspect Fit applied.p  pIt has been suggested that I could use codeAVMakeRectWithAspectRatioInsidecode to produce a codeCGRectcode with the same dimensions of the codeUIImagecode after it has has Aspect Fit applied, use the CGRect to update the frame of the codeUIImageViewcode, and then update the constraints.p  pI have managed to produce the new codeCGRectcode and update the frame of the codeUIImageViewcode. I have then changed my constraints on the codeUITextFieldscode so that they align with the codeUIImageViewcode instead of the toolbar however the codeUITextFieldscode dont reposition themselves when the frame is updated.p  pI call the following after the frame has been updatedp  precodeview.setNeedUpdateConstraints codepre  pIf anyone has an idea at the best way to approach this problem that would be great.p  pstrongEDITstrong p  pHere is the code from the viewController in project I have created to isolate and try to solve this issue..p  precodeimport UIKit import AVFoundation  class ViewController UIViewController       IBOutlet weak var imageViewPic UIImageView     IBOutlet weak var topTextToToolberContraint NSLayoutConstraint     IBOutlet weak var bottomTextToToolbarConstraint NSLayoutConstraint     IBOutlet weak var topText UILabel     IBOutlet weak var bottomText UILabel      override func viewDidLoad          super.viewDidLoad           override func viewWillAppearanimated Bool          let imageToDisplay  UIImagenamed CaptainPicardFacepalm         imageViewPic.image  imageToDisplay           func updateFrame                  let resizedImageSize  imageViewPic.image.size         let imageViewBounds  imageViewPic.bounds         let newRect  AVMakeRectWithAspectRatioInsideRectresizedImageSize, imageViewBounds         imageViewPic.frame  newRect           override func willRotateToInterfaceOrientationtoInterfaceOrientation UIInterfaceOrientation, duration NSTimeInterval          updateFrame         view.setNeedsLayout       codepre
