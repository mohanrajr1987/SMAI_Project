Positive 28 pI am working on a small expense tracking program. The idea is to have a list that holds Expense objects that can be manipulated and used to perform calculations. p  pI was able to create the List without issue and populate it with several dummy expenses. My expenses are grouped by category, Expense.expenseType, to allow me to do calculations for analysis so I am trying to make another List that will store category names and relevant calculations values. The list of category names is meant to remove duplicates but so far Ive been unsuccessful at populating it. p  pMy approach for creating the List has been to define a Category class that holds only a string parameter for categoryName and a float for categoryTotal although the latter is initialized to 0.00. I then have a For loop that copies the names into the List and a second For loop that removes indexes based on the name once theyve been alphabetized. Ive tried different variations of this but ultimately I get either an index that is out of bounds or a reduced but still duplicates list of categoryName. p  pReally hoping to get some advice so I could move forward with the code. I didnt add the actual code since Im new to CVS and figure I may be approaching the problem all wrong. p
Positive 28 pI made what Im calling a codeTreePrunercode.

Ive used this on very small hierarchies where the complete hierarchy is already in memory so there should be no linqtosql surprises.

Its only a few levels deep with only one node on most levels. As its currently written, the slowness will occur on the first emrecursiveem call to codePrunecode when I call codelist.Countcode, because thats when the second level of the hierarchy codeexcluded.SelectManythis.getChildrencode is being evaluated.p  pIf, however, I add a code.ToListcode call like sop  precodevar included  list.Wherecondition.ToList codepre  pThen the slowness will occur at that point.p  pWhat do I need to do to make this thing go fastp  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pAfter someone prompted me to reevaluate my condition more carefully, I realized that those associations in codehasBusinessUnitsForUsercode were not being eager loaded.

Negative 28 pI am trying to add a codeUIImageViewcode to the back of a navigation bar. br  The reason is because I want to create a codeUITableViewcode whose navigation bar is actually a picture with back button on the left but I want the picture to scroll with the tableview and when the picture is fully scrolled out. The navigation bar is shown as per normal. br  strongMy solution to this problemstrong br  Add a codeUIImageViewcode to the top of the codeUITableViewcode and make the navigation bar transparent. Set a codecontentOffsetcode for the codeUITableViewcode which is a subclass of codeUIScrollViewcode so that when the view is presented, it looks like the picture is filling the navigation status bar. br  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comFNWHH.png altWhen the view is shown, it is exactly what I want. strongProblemstrong br  If I scroll up, instead of bouncing back, the transparent status bar is shown with a color of the background as it is transparent. br  img srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhGIDv.png altIf I scroll up, instead of bouncing back, I see the transparent navigation bar. strongPossible way to solve this new problemstrong br  I was thinking of trying to limit the codeScrollViewcode size to get around with problem but failed. br  So I feel is it possible to add the codeUIImageViewcode to the back of the navigation bar so that it is there without any offset Since that way, my life will be much easier. br  Any suggestions on solving this or another new approach to get the same UIeffect br  Related a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19143353whydoesuiviewcontrollerextendunderuinavigationbarwhileuitableviewcontrolquestion.ap

Negative 28 pWe have a relational database with data.  Currently the queries take to long for reporting, so we would like to use that data in a reporting database.p  pI want to analyze the queries that we use, run the queries at night and put the un normalized into tables that are read only.  I do not believe that there are enough queries to necessitate a data mart.p  pMy boss wants to write everything into xml packages and then whatever database we design, we will read in the xml files.p  pLike every person on earth, I think that my way is right.  But, I have been wrong before. Can I get some advice and the pluses and minuses of each methodp
Negative 28 pI am using a codeUIPageViewControllercode to scroll through some view controllers. However, I need to dismiss the codeUIPageViewControllercode at the beginning and end of the array of view controllers, ie, if while scrolling through page view controller, if we have reached the boundary of the view controller array, dismiss the view controller.p  pFor the dismiss, I am using a codeUIPanGestureRecognizercode called codedismissPanGestureRecognizercode. This works wonderfully when the transition style of UIPageViewController is codeUIPageViewControllerTransitionStylePageCurlcode. In that case I can hook up my gestures like sop  pin codeviewDidLoadcodep  precode[pageViewController.gestureRecognizers enumerateObjectsUsingBlockUIGestureRecognizer gR, NSUInteger idx, BOOL stop     gR.delegate  self     [dismissPanGestureRecognizer requireGestureRecognizerToFailgR] ]  self.view.gestureRecognizers  self.pageViewController.gestureRecognizers codepre  pFor the codeUIGestureRecognizerDelegatecode methods, its something like thisp  precode BOOLgestureRecognizerShouldBeginUIGestureRecognizer gestureRecognizer       If we are at the left boundary and this is a pan gesture going rightleft,      return NO      Else If we are at the right boundary and this is a pan gesture going leftright,      return NO      Else return YES  codepre  pSo far so good. If its a pan gesture, we use it to dismiss only if page view controller gestures are not interested in it.p  pThe problem occurs when the transition style is codeUIPageViewControllerTransitionStyleScrollcode. In that case the codeUIPageViewControllercode dont have any gesture recognizers. It looks like it gets implemented using an internal view pageViewController.view.subviews called codeUIQueuingScrollViewcode which I would rather not muck around with. What happens is that in scrolling transition type, at the boundary of the view controller, the scroll view just bounces, and the pan gesture recognizer never gets fired for dismissal.  I had tried setting the codebouncescode property of UIQueuingScrollView to NO, and then the pages dont even change.p  pNext I tried adding a transparent codeUIViewcode on top of the codeUIPageViewControllercode view and then implementing codehitTestwithEventcode on that, thinking I will forward the event to pageViewController only when it is not at the boundaries. But while it does give some degree of control on when to allow pages to turn, it stops other gestures to get passed to pageController views too like tapping on a button, etc.p  pI am trying to find ways on how I can get my own UIPanGestureRecognizer to get fired when I reach the boundary of a UIPageViewController UIPageViewControllerDataSource methods returns codenilcode, when the transition style is codeUIPageViewControllerTransitionStyleScrollcode.p  pI am currently testing on iOS6iOS7.p
