Negative 984 pIf a public API is not a REST or RESTful API, what is it called Before answering the question, please continue reading below.p  pIve been researching REST, particularly for the purpose of creating a RESTful service in the near future. I thought I had a pretty good grasp at the idea of REST and all its intricacies until I stumbled upon Roy Fieldings hes pretty much the founder of REST post called a hrefhttproy.gbiv.comuntangled2008restapismustbehypertextdriven relnofollowREST APIs must be hypertextdrivena. If you read the post, he basically implies that the Richardson Maturity Model of Rest is a bunch of bogus fluff. He states very specifically in the aforementioned post that if your API is not HYPERMEDIA driven, you DO NOT have a REST API  No ifs, ands, or buts about itp  pNow that thats out of the way, let me tell you where the confusion comes in. As part of my studies in REST, Ive looked at a lot of examples of socalled Rest APIs online. One example is Twitters REST API. It isnt hypermedia driven Its just a bunch of http endpoints that throw xml or json back to the requestor. This goes for basically every other public Rest API that Ive seen online  nobody uses hypermedia, but for some reason they still call their services RESTfulp  pWith all that context, I return back to my original question. Ok, so maybe Twitter doesnt have, by technical definition, a true Rest Api, since it isnt hypermedia driven... If thats the case, is there a name for the type of API that Twitter has or any other similar style API that you can find online p  pI know many of you will want to say something like, its just semantics  dont worry about it, but please refrain from answering that way. I like to speak accurately and want to know what to call an API like Twitters that isnt really a REST api yes, even if Twitter still calls it a REST API.p  pAlso, I know what SOAP services are. Im specifically referring to HTTP based public APIs that people tend to refer to as REST APIs. Is there a better name for these than REST APIsp  pstrongUPDATEstrong To clarify my initial question. I was really asking Is there such thing as a nonREST api since I had never heard anyone say that they have a nonREST api. The basis of my question came from the fact that REST seems to be a buzz word flying around with different meanings for different people and I was trying to figure out if there was an alternative to a REST api.p  pI have learned that there is such thing as a Web Api or HTTP interface that isnt RESTful. In fact, that is what many socalled REST Apis actually are. REST is strongnotstrong an endpoint accessible over http, nor a URL structure or the use of http methods to perform CRUD operations on server resources. REST is an architectural style defined by a handful of networkweb constraints. If you are not following all of these constraints, you are not RESTful which is not bad thing  its just not REST  see Roy Fieldings link provided above if you think otherwise. The constraint that is most commonly missed by many who are calling their services RESTful seems to be the Uniform Interface subconstraint called Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State. p

Negative 984 pAfter searching a lot here, I could not find solution to my problem. So, I am posting this question.p  pI have a Database Table which has the structure like thisp  precodefolderid    foldername    parentid      1          Private          0     2          Public           0     3          Photos           0     4          December         3     5          Bday             4     6          Celeb            5 codepre  pIn hierarchical form, it will be like a folder structure p  precode Private  Public  Photos  December  Bday  Celeb codepre  pNow, I would like to select a Path upto a particular folder, like to strongBdaystrong or strongCelebstrong folder.

The Query I am currently trying p  precodeSELECT f.
