Positive 343 pIn a controller of a Symfony2 application, I use collection of elements. The more elements there are, the more time it takes. It sounds logical but it seems that there are repeated traitmentsp  ul liI create a form from MyCollectionTypeli liin the buildForm method, I add the ElementType that has its own buildForm method.li ul  pThen when the form is built by Symfony2 with the list of elements I pass, the buildForm method of the ElementType is called one time for each elementp  p is this not possible that the first ELementType is built, then  other are cloned p  pI dont see why there would be any different there between these subforms, the only difference will appear setting the data and not building the form.p  pThen I notice the same for the buildView method there are a lot of repeated processing for each element, where only the data possibly processing of listeners may vary. For example, in my application, with a ElementType having 6 fields, and a collection of 700 elements, it takes up to 30s to render the form. Is it due to the way that forms are handled, or can be be optimized p

That page can be accessed from localhost9090saveProfile. That page opens fine, however, when I refreshed that page, the URL in the browser become localhost9090saveProfile.
