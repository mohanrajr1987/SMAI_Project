Negative 2702 pWe are working on a project that will feature realtime statistics of some actions e.g. clicks. On every click, we will log information like date, age and gender these come from Facebook, location, etc.p  pWe are discussing about the best place to store these information and use them for realtime stats. We will display aggregate statistics for example, number of clicks, number of clicks made by malefemale, number of clicks divided by age groups e.g. 1824, 2430....p  pSince on the site we are using MongoDB everywhere, my colleague thought we should store statistics inside it as well. I, however, would prefer a SQLbased database for this task, like MySQL or maybe Drizzle, because I believe SQL is better when doing operations like data aggregation. Although theres the overhead of parsing the SQL, I think MySQLDrizzle may actually be faster than NoSQL databases here. And inserts are not slow too, when using INSERT DELAYED queries.p  pPlease note that we do not need to perform JOINS or collect data from multiple tablescollections. Thus, we dont care if the database is different. However, we do care about scalability and reliability. We are building something that will hopefully become very big, and weve designed every single line of code with scalability in mind.p  pWhat do you think about this Is there any reason to prefer MongoDB over MySQLDrizzle for this Or is it indifferent Which one would you use, if you were usp  pThank you, Alessandrop
