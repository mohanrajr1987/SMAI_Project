Negative 382 pI am trying to dynamically create and then move an image in an Android activity. However, the setX and setY methods seem to not work correctly. It correctly sets the position of an image when it is first created and placed, but any attempt to update it results in the image being placed in the wrong spot. For instance, the image moves on the following codep  precodeImageView image RelativeLayout layout  RelativeLayoutfindViewByIdR.id.activitythis  ifaction  MotionEvent.ACTIONDOWN      image  new ImageViewMyClass.this                                 layout.addViewimage, width, height        image.setX206     image.setY206  else ifaction  MotionEvent.ACTIONMOVE      ifimage  null         image.setX206         image.setY206       codepre  pOn ACTIONMOVE the image is moved even though the x and y position values remain the same. The parent of the image remains the same. The size remains the same. If I get the x and y values it will still say 206, but it is not placed at 206, 206 on the activity anymore. I am lost as to why this is happening. I cant find any indication that the image has been altered except for it physically changing location.p
