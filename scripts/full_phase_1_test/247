Positive 247 pSuppose I have a class codecom.example.Foocode and another class codecom.sample.Barcode which needs to know the fullyqualified name of codeFoocode. If I am a Java novice I might putp  precodepublic class Bar      private String fooName  com.example.Foo     ...  codepre  pHowever, if I refactored codeFoocode to change the name or package, the changes would not be reflected in codeBarcode, unless the IDE is really clever. So its better to do something like thisp  precodeimport com.example.Foo  public class Bar      private String fooName  Foo.class.getName      ...  codepre  pThis way, if I refactor codeFoocode, then the change should be picked up by codeBarcode.p  pNow consider methods. If I have a method name in class codeFoocode and the name needs to be known by codeBarcode, it seems the best I can do isp  precodepublic class Bar      private String bazName  Foo.class.getMethodbazMethod, Qux.class      ...  codepre  pBut I havent actually achieved anything  I still have a string literal bazMethod which wont be refactored if the real codebazMethodcode gets renamed.p  pWhat I really want to do is something likep  precodepublic class Bar      private String bazName  tellMeTheMethodNamenew Foo.bazMethodnull      ...  codepre  pNot sure if this is possible somehow and if there is any way around it.p  pNow comes the real problem  even if you can sort that out as above, the real thing I am trying to access is an annotation attributeelement name. But annotations are abstract and cannot even be instantiated. So is this possiblep

Negative 247 pStandard convex hull algorithms will not work with longitude, latitudepoints, because standard algorithms assume you want the hull of a set of Cartesian points. Latitudelongitude points are emnotem Cartesian, because longitude wraps around at the antimeridian  180 degrees. I.e., two degrees east of longitude 179 is 179.p  pSo if your set of points happens to straddle the antimeridian, you will compute spurious hulls that stretch all the way around the world incorrectly.p  pAny suggestions for tricks I could apply with a standard convex hull algorithm to correct for this, or pointers to proper geospherical hull algorithmsp  pNow that I think on it, there are more interesting cases to consider than straddling the antimerdian. Consider a band of points that encircle the earth  its convex hull would have no eastwest bounds. Or even further, what is the convex hull of 0,0, 0, 90, 0, 90, 90, 0, 90, 0, 180, 0  it would seem to contain the entire surface of the earth, so which points are on its perimeterp
