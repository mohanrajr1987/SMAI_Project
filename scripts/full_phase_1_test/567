It took me awhile to figure out the relationship between the two and ultimately decided on a traditional junction table as followsp  precode                     Publications id, SvcReqID, LogID                                                                                                         SvcRequest id              SvcProgressLog id codepre  pSvcRequest amp SvcProgressLog are more or less sibling tables both containing a reference to the parent. There is this weird hierarchical kind of relationship that took me awhile to figure out, now I just need a way to join them which makes it easy to perform CRUD operations.p  pThe process here is as followsp  ol liA service request for a publication comes in.li listrongIf the Publication exists  update the corresponding Publication record. If not, create a new Publication. After that, create the SvcRequest record from information captured from a webform.strong help needed hereli liFinally a Log entry can be created for Requests that exists, but not yet Logged.li ol  pThe following relations existp  ul liPublications  SvcRequest  1  Manyli liPublications  SvcProgressLog  1  Manyli liSvcRequest  SvcProgressLog  Many  Many ishli ul  pAs always, I greatly appreciate the help and words of wisdom  p
