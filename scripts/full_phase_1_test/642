I register the MrBean module with my object mapper, so all I have to do is define a bunch of interfaces, and the POJOs are generated automagically, based on those interfaces.p  pI would like to have a Credentials interface with various types of credentials that extend it, e.g. UsernamePasswordCredentials and CertificateFileCredentials.p  pDoing this without any annotations or other incantations to try to make it work gives me the following error in my unit testp  precodeorg.codehaus.jackson.map.exc.UnrecognizedPropertyException Unrecognized field username Class org.codehaus.jackson.generated.SCRUBBED.Credentials, not marked as ignorable  at [Source java.io.StringReadere0b6f5 line 32, column 29] through reference chain HostConfiguration[hostDefinitions]gtHostDefinition[credentials]gtCredentials[username] codepre  pIve also a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8565299polymorphisminjsonjerseyandjacksonfollowed the instructions at another StackOverflow posta, and Im getting the same error.p  pThe error makes sense Jackson is trying to map the contents of my JSON file to an empty interface.  However, I naively, perhaps expected Jackson to look for interfaces that extend the base Credentials interface and try to match up the fields in those interfaces to the fields it found in the JSON object.p  pIve seen some examples at the Jackson wiki that make use of metainformation in the JSON object, e.g. decorating an object with codeclassfoo.bar.CertificateFileCredentialscode, but Id prefer to avoid any of that since my JSON input will be generated automatically by other services, and those other services shouldnt have to know anything about the internals of my service.p  pThanksp
