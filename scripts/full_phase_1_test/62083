Positive 62083 pI have been using Database First Entity Framework EDMX and SQL Server Data Tools Database Projects in combination very successfully  change the schema in the database and Update Model from Database to get them into the EDMX. I see though that Entity Framework 7 will be dropping the EDMX format and I am looking for a new process that will allow me to use Code First in Combination with Database Projects.p  pLots of my existing development and deployment processes rely on having a database project that contains the schema. This goes in source control is deployed along with the code and is used to update the production database complete with data migration using pre and post deployment scripts. I would be reluctant to drop it.p  pI would be keen to split one big EDMX into many smaller models as part of this work. This will mean multiple Code First models referencing the same database.p  pAssuming that I have an existing database and a database project to go with it  I am thinking that I would start by using the following wizard to create an initial set of entity and context classes  I would do this for each of the models.p  precodeAdd  New Item...

I guess that I would need to keep any modifications to the entity andor context classes in partial classes so that they do not get overwritten. Automating this with a list of tables etc to include would be handy. Powershell or T4 Templates maybe a hrefhttpsgithub.comaeslinger0sqlsharpener relnofollowSqlSharpenera suggested by Keith in comments looks like it might help here.

From what I understand, not having models map cleanly to database schemas mine dont might pose problems.

Positive 62083 pI have a legacy system that I am hoping to use EF to clean up the mess of ADO code it uses for data access.p  pThe system uses the following class hierachy Sponsors which are Members which are People.

But when I try to map the Sponsor class, I get an error because it is trying to find a field named PersonId on the Sponsor table.p  pIs it possible to tell EF that the Sponsor query needs to join using the MemberId Foreign Key  Or is this poor db structure not going to work with EFp

Negative 62083 pIm trying to understand how the image size is encoded in the bitmap file header. The a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBMPfileformat relnofollowwikipedia pagea only shows examples of images smaller than 255 bytes, hence the size is encoded in a single byte, followed by three 0 bytes.p  pThe problem is that when I test out bigger images, I cannot relate the encoded bytes to the real size.p  pre classlangsh prettyprintoverridecode identify bmp1.bmp bmp1.bmp BMP3 10x10 10x1000 1bit sRGB 2c 102B 0.000u 000.000  identify bmp2.bmp bmp2.bmp BMP3 92x76 92x7600 1bit sRGB 2c 974B 0.000u 000.000 codepre  pre classlangpy prettyprintoverridecodeIn [28] [ordc for c in bmp1[26]] Out[28] [102, 0, 0, 0]  In [29] lenbmp1 Out[29] 102  In [30] [ordc for c in bmp2[26]] Out[30] [206, 3, 0, 0]  In [31] lenbmp2 Out[31] 974 codepre  pAs you can see, the first image has 102 bytes, and the file header contains the size 102 encoded. But the second image has 974 bytes, and the file header contains the bytes 206 and 3. Is that because the file header size is not reliable, and I shouldnt try to read the size from those bytes  Otherwise, how do you calculate 974 from 206 and 3 p
Negative 62083 pI am doing some crypto for my homework. The program doesnt show any errors while compiling. However when I run the program I get an exception  codejava.security.NoSuchAlgorithmExceptioncode. I think this is due to the crypto restrictions. I have downloded and imported Java Cryptography Extension JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files 6 but I am not sure whether the these libraries actually do the crypto. I couldnt find any Sun JCE jar which Ive seen imported in some example programs that use crypto  like codeimport com.sun.crypto.provider.SunJCEcode.p  pCan anyone provide any directions as to how to run my code without exceptionsp

Negative 62083 pMy REST API api.example.com is currently an OAuth2 provider and has been the support of a mobile app. p  pRecently we have created a new websitewww.example.com which will be treated like any other client. The web can authenticate on the API by using a strongempassword granttypeemstrong where a user types in her credentials. From there the clientbrowser gets an access token and can than consume the API. p  pThe problem comes that we want to authenticate clients on the webpage using Facebook. p  pSo basically, the web should in the end be able to get an user access token to access the API by logging in via Facebook. p  pIve looked around and Ive seen two legged and three legged OAuth2 authentication scenarios but p  ul liHow does that applies on the scenario I just describedli liWhat is the right way of doing this li liWhat are the security issues I should take into account li ul

However I have to name the file index.php because Im hosting through Heroku. p
