Positive 1281 pIn a project I inherited, the packages.json looks roughly like thisp  precode   name ...,   version ...,   description ,   author ...,   license ISC,   dependencies      lodash 3.10.1,     assemble 0.4.37,     cheerio 0.16.0,     grunt 0.4.4,     gruntbuildcontrol 0.1.3,    ,   keywords [     handlebarshelpermd,     handlebarshelperrel   ]  codepre  pWhen I first got it, codelodashcode was code2.4.1code and Im trying to update it to code3.10.1code as shown above. However, codenpmcode continues to install code2.4.1code at the toplevel Despite the codepackage.jsoncode requesting the newer version and it does not install the requested versions code2.4.1code or code2.4.2code in some of the dependencies like codeassemblecode and codecheeriocode. Thus when I codenpm install lodash3.10.1code it complains about unmet dependencies. p  pIve tried removing codenodemodulescode and codenpm clear cachecode and coderm rf HOME.npmcode in different orders and combinations with no change.p  pHow do I get codelodash3.10.1code to install at the toplevel and the requested version of codelodashcode in all the dependencies and not have the dependencies use the toplevel copy of codelodashcode  which I thought was the normal way for codenpmcode to work p  pPreferably a solution would not require updating all the dependencies to new versions assuming that is even possible. That could be a solution, but that would require a lot more validation to make sure nothing broke. p
Positive 1281 pI have found plenty of tutorials explaining how to use Laravel and Angular together for a single page app. Each seems to have its own method of adjusting the public directory, or forwarding a file using the File helper.p  pRight now I have changed my public path in my codeconfigview.phpcode.

Negative 1281 pCan Spark and HadoopYarn be deployed on different cluster p  pThe problem scenario is as followsp  ol liThe datahive tables already resides in Hadoop lake.li liI want to implement some BI processing on this data.li liOne way is deploy Spark on this Hadoop cluster and utilize the existing CPURAM resources for data processing. This works fine.li liHowever I want to have different set to Spark Cluster4 worker nodes which fetches data from Hadoop lake data size not more than 500GB, do the processing and display output from Spark cluster. Ocassionally, the processed data will be stored back in Hadoop lake. The reason for this is it gives me more control over my BI logic and doesnt interferes with existing Hadoop lake.
