Negative 8945 pIm using QtC and trying to draw a large and complex QGraphicsScene.  Once I add a lot of objects, panning and zooming become unpleasantly slow.  No surprise here, of course.  Ive played with device coordinate caching helps with panning to a point and minimal viewport updates and so on, but eventually theres just too many objects.  What Id like to do is draw the items asynchronously from controlling the UI somehow.  In other words, just like Google Maps does, I want to pan and zoom and let drawing catch up as fast as its able, but to be able to pan again before the items finish drawing.p  pOne method Im trying is to create two QGraphicsScenes.  One has the actual objects but is not attached to a QGraphicsView.  The other QGraphicsScene is connected to the QGraphicsView, but it just has some tiled QPixmaps that are sized to cover the screen.  The plan is to use spare CPU cycles to update any tile pixmap that needs it.  This seems like it will give me the necessary control over rendering so I dont have to block while rerendering the entire visible scene.  Thoughts  Has anyone implemented thisp
