Positive 691 pI am using csssprites on a few pages of a website as navigation buttons, with a part of the image darkening when hovered over. All these buttons have text on them. Before I had just written the text onto the image and things worked fine, but I wanted to add the text to my html so that it renders better for anyone that zooms in to the page. Doing this however has now caused the images for the sprites not to appear in Firefox, Chrome and IE still works fine in Safari. p  pObviously I assumed that adding the text to the code had caused this but now even when I remove the text, the images still dont show up. Im really having trouble figuring out why this is, especially as I have 2 other pages that use sprites and they are still working fine. The only difference is that i hadnt attempted to move the text into my code on those pages.p  pAny suggestions are really appreciatedp  pCode for the broken spritesp  precode.row5  width 940px height 220px position absolute left 10px top 1215px   .box1  background urlhttpwww.sungblue.comImagesbox1sprite.jpg 0 0 backgroundrepeat norepeat width 306px height 200px position absolute top 10px   .boxtext  fontfamily elron color rgba255,255,255,1.00 fontsize 18px width 306px height 18px position absolute top 175px left 0px textalign center   .box1hover  backgroundposition 0 201px   .box2  background urlhttpwww.sungblue.comImagesbox2sprite.jpg 0 0 backgroundrepeat norepeat width 306px height 200px position absolute top 10px left 317px   .box2hover  backgroundposition 0 201px   .box3  background urlhttpwww.sungblue.comImagesbox3sprite.jpg 0 0 backgroundrepeat norepeat width 306px height 200px position absolute top 10px left 634px   .box3hover  backgroundposition 0 201px   .row6  width 940px height 220px position absolute left 10px top 1425px   .box4  background urlhttpwww.sungblue.comImagesbox4sprite.jpg 0 0 backgroundrepeat norepeat width 306px height 200px position absolute top 10px   .box4hover  backgroundposition 0 201px   .box5  background urlhttpwww.sungblue.comImagesbox5sprite.jpg 0 0 backgroundrepeat norepeat width 306px height 200px position absolute top 10px left 317px   .box5hover  backgroundposition 0 201px   .box6  background urlhttpwww.sungblue.comImagesbox6sprite.jpg 0 0 backgroundrepeat norepeat width 306px height 200px position absolute top 10px left 634px   .box6hover  backgroundposition 0 201px   ltdiv classrow5gt     lta hrefhttpwww.sungblue.comweddings.htmlgt         ltdiv classbox1gt             ltdiv classboxtextgtWEDDINGSltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltagt     lta hrefhttpwww.sungblue.comprewedding.htmlgt         ltdiv classbox2gt             ltdiv classboxtextgtENGAGEMENT SHOOTSltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltagt     lta hrefhttpwww.sungblue.comcontact.htmlgt         ltdiv classbox3gt             ltdiv classboxtextgtCONTACTltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltagt ltdivgt ltdiv classrow6gt     lta hrefhttpsungbluephotography.zenfolio.comgt         ltdiv classbox4gt             ltdiv classboxtextgtCLIENT AREAltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltagt     lta hrefhttpwww.sungblue.comprices.htmlgt         ltdiv classbox5gt             ltdiv classboxtextgtPRICINGltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltagt     lta hrefhttpsungbluephotography.zenfolio.combloggt         ltdiv classbox6gt             ltdiv classboxtextgtBLOGltdivgt         ltdivgt     ltagt ltdivgt codepre  pAnd heres the code from my other page where my sprites are workingp  precode.row3  width 940px height 288px position absolute left 10px top 335px textalign center   .box1  backgroundimage urlhttpwww.sungblue.comImagesweddingbox1sprite.jpg width 465px height 288px position absolute top 0px left 0px   .boxtext  width 465px height 18px position absolute left 0px top 260px fontfamily elron fontsize 18px color rgba255,255,255,1.00 textalign center   .box1hover  backgroundposition 0 289px   .box2  backgroundimage urlhttpwww.sungblue.comImagesweddingbox2sprite.jpg width 465px height 288px position absolute top 0px left 475px   .box2hover  backgroundposition 0 289px   .row4  width 940px height 288px position absolute left 10px top 633px textalign center   .box3  backgroundimage urlhttpwww.sungblue.comImagesweddingbox3sprite.jpg width 465px height 288px position absolute top 0px left 0px   .box3hover  backgroundposition 0 289px   .box4  backgroundimage urlhttpwww.sungblue.comImagesweddingbox4sprite.jpg width 465px height 288px position absolute top 0px left 475px   .box4hover  backgroundposition 0 289px  codepre

Positive 691 pI have this following javascript code which executes my function, when i press the left mouse and drag it across the screen p  precodefunction MyFunce      I copied this part from another SO question    e.preventDefault    e.stopPropagation    e.cancelBubble  true    e.returnValue  false     This should cancel out all default actions, should it not     return false   document.addEventListenermousemove, MyFunc false codepre  pWhat this is supposed to do is, that when the mouse is dragged across the screen while the left button is pressed, then it prevents text  or any other elements  from being selected.
