Positive 2512 pI have a PHP generated .ics calendar file on my server.p  pSeveral clients are subscribed to this calendar, e.g. using Google Calendar and Apple iCalCalendar.p  pI want to delete the calendar and all events in it, in a way that it is also removed from the clients.p  pIt seems that if I delete the .ics file, the events will still exist in the clients.p  pShould I keep an empty .ics file Or is there some syntax I should use to instruct the clients that the calendar is no longer to be usedp
Positive 2512 pI answered a question about testing to see if a date was in the same, previous, or even earlier week compared to a reference date.p  pIn this case the question was about testing to see if the earlier date was less than 5, less than 10 or 10 or more working days before the reference date, and referred to a previous question about testing to see if the earlier date was less than 7, less than 14, or 14 or more days before the reference date.p  pI wanted to try and answer the related question of whether a given date is in the same calendar week Sunday to Saturday, or in the previous calendar week, or in an earlier calendar week.p  pMy first thought was to use the WEEKNUM function, so if the reference date is TODAY, this would be p  precodeIFWEEKNUMTODAYWEEKNUMA2gt1,Old,IFWEEKNUMTODAYWEEKNUMA2gt0,Last week,This week codepre  pHowever this doesnt work across year boundaries because WEEKNUM starts at 1 for each new year.p  pIn a normal year, WEEKNUM runs from 1 to 53 because there are just over 52 weeks in the year.  So it would appear that the above formula could be adapted to work across year boundaries simply by adding the YEARA2  52 or possibly 53 to the WEEKNUM.p  pHowever consider a leap year which starts on a Saturday and finishes on a Sunday. In this case WEEKNUM runs from 1 to 54.p  pThe last such leap year was 2000 and the next one is 2028.p  pIm not clear if it will work in every case.p  pThe reference date is 10th January 2001.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comqCPHv.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqCPHv.png altenter image description hereap  pI will try and post an answer later.p
Positive 2512 pI need to make a form to hold a reservation for a restaurantp  pTo choose the reserv date, I thought it best to use a CalendarView. But not every restaurant open all days of the week.  But disable only specific dates.p  pI tried many libraries similar to CalendarView, so you can dynamically block the specific days that fall on the day where the restaurant is closed.p  pSop  pI need a calendarview where can disable the days are Monday, Tuesdays, etc ...p  pSorry about this English Google translate.

Positive 2512 pHow can I retrieve the displayed date range in an Outlook Calendar For example, when I open the week view of the current week, I need to know in code that the current calendar displays the range from 20150921 to 20150927.p  pLets assume I have a reference to the calendar as a codeMAPIFoldercode object. I found out that this object has a codeCurrentViewcode member with several promising properties. But codeDisplayedDatescode contains no items, codeFiltercode is empty and codeSelectedEndTimecode  codeSelectedStartTimecode both points to 45010101, i.e. no date set. So what am I doing wrong And yes, at the time of evaluating this object, the calendar view in Outlook is open and active.p  pSecond question After it is possible to get the current display range, is there a callback or event which I can consume that is fired when the display range changesp

Negative 2512 pI need to write to and read from a Ethernet chips FIFO and for that I want to use DMA controller. So I modified an existing driver and made the process to sleep using waiteventinterruptible after triggering DMA transfer and made it woken up by ISR using wakeupinterruptible. My problem is that the original driver was using spinlock to protect the FIFO access. But as all know, while holding spinlock, I should not sleep. So I tried replacing spinlock with mutex. Because, I might sleep while acquiring the mutex, and after getting the mutex, Ill sleep again after DMA trigger. I get woken up by the ISR, and Ill release the mutex. No problem I thought.  But I still get this scheduling while atomic BUG. The question is  I need to go to sleep until DMA completion while holding a lock for FIFO read and write. Isnt it ok to sleep while holding a mutexbr ADD  In my case, the receive function reading the receive FIFO was NAPI poll function which is a one of softirq interrupt mask is reset, but still its interrupt context. tasklet is also interrupt context. To read FIFO I use DMA and goto sleep, so this was the problem  sleeping during softirq.p
