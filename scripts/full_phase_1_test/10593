Negative 10593 pI am trying to maintain a local store of a database, accessible via a REST API. I am attempting to use the fantastic RoboSpice and Spring libraries for the REST client, Jackson to parsecache the JSON response and ORMLite to persist the resulting objects. p  pThe problem is that I dont know how to store foreign object relationships for the JSON responses I get. Sometimes the JSON objects are nested, other times they are referenced by Id.p  pA typical systems responsep  precode     id567,     nameThe only system,     competitions[          id123,          systemid567          ...     ]  codepre  pA competitions responsep  precodeitems      123         id123,         systemid567  System only referenced by id         ...      codepre  pAnother competitions responsep  precodeitems      123         id123,         systemid567,  System referenced by id and nested         system             id567,             nameThe only system,             ...                codepre  pNested objects work fine, but its the cases where there is a reference by id that is killing it.

Even if the system object is not nested in the Competition object, the Competition should be able to map a relationship to the System object in the local database, because the id of the system is always provided. p  pThe other problem I suspect is that Im using two object persisters, the JacksonObjectPersister and the InDatabaseObjectPersisterFactory provided by RoboSpice for use with ORMLite. The reason for this is because I dont want to persist the lists that the objects are nested in to the database. By my understanding, Jackson should cache the JSON response from the server, ORMLite should cache the data model.p  pThis is the error Im gettingp  precode0203 151557.640 DDefaultRequestRunner.java16620944 151557.636 Thread28  An exception occurred during service execution org.codehaus.jackson.map.JsonMappingExceptionwas java.lang.NullPointerException  through reference chain com.company.app.api.objects.List[items]gt java.util.HashMap[51]gt com.company.app.api.objects.Competition[systemid] codepre  pApologies for what seems like a number of questions in one, I am bashing my head against a wall.
