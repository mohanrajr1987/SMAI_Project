Positive 68203 pIm trying to use a hrefhttpsgithub.combenebgulpuncss relnofollowgulpuncssa but it doesnt seem to be working properly due to the fact that Im working on a site that is not responsive and still uses useragent to change to a mobile only stylesheet. Uncss uses PhantomJS that supposedly has a useragent option that might get this working properly. It seems to me that its currently looking at the desktop page rather than mobile. Anyone know how I would go about forking either gulpuncss or just uncss, or is there something better to use now It looks like uncss is no longer being maintained.p
