Positive 77497 pI have a Web Api project and currently updating an entity is done via POST. Creating an entity is also done via the same POST method, and I implement by checking if the user has sent me an entity Id and then implementing an update as opposed to a create.p  pThis is bad good for a number of obvious reasons. Its also confusing from a client perspective and makes the whole method slow and hard to define.p  pSo Im splitting updating into a PUT method, and I want it to be like so psuedo codep  precodepublic string PUTMyModel model      Check if model Id is sent. return if not.

Positive 77497 pI have been put in charge of building an IVR using vXML and asp.net. For some reason the voice server we are using requires ASP.net and cannot use PHP in conjunction with vXML so I am stuck learning ASP.net. The application is pretty simple in that it runs an ASP.net file with vXML and should pull data from a database based on user input. p  pExample User enters customer ID 23313 It should then pull data from our SQL2012 DB that corresponds to that ID and read it back via prompts. Simple enough I figured. p  pA have a couple questions regarding possible solutions to this p  pIs it possible for ASPvXML to pull data from PHP dynamically post or get statements, and use the data in the current vXML document or will I have to bite the bullet and figure out a second pagep  pif using PHP is not ideal or possible, would it be better or possible to add a db connection into the aspvXML document and run the IVR that way p  pI am not very familiar with ASP.net, and am trying to find out the most efficient way to accomplish my goal without having to have an additional vXML page to run.p  pAny help appreciated. p  pstrongemEDITemstrong After further investigation and help from Jim I was able to get inline PHP working.

Negative 77497 pThe program is relatively simple, and is only suppose to take in a text file of a semicolondelimited valuestringline, reverse the order of the values, put it all back together, and output to a new file. There are specifications, however, that we must use a stack that implements a simple Linked List data structure. Im pretty new to C, and am just picking up the basics of pointers I come from Java and .NET, and this is a nightmare for me to grapple with lol. Also, the specifications specifically say that the push function MUST take in the old top of stack node and the value to push, and return the updated pointer to the top of the stack. Also, pop MUST take in as parameters a pointer of a pointer to the current top of the stack, and return the value of the popped node.p  pWe are suppose to compile with gcc o progname progname.c Wall m32 O. The source compiles just fine, but when attempting to build the stack and such with an actual sample file, I receive a Segmentation Fault. Ive run my code through gdb, however, and its saying that Segmentation Fault is occurring at my pushvalues  head, str1 call in main. Since this is the call to push, Im guessing theres more fundamental logic error Im overlooking in my linked list andor stack.p  pIve exhausted my brain at this point, and cannot for the life of me figure out where Im going wrong.
