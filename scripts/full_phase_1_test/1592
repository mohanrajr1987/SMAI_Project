Positive 1592 pIm working on a project that migrating some workbooks on Windows Server 2008 R2 HPC Enterprise edition with SP3. I use workbook offloading mode as most of the calc logic is included in the sheetscells and the links. Some logics are defined in excel addins .xla files but they are not complicated so I decided to NOT move them into XLL working as UDF offloading.p  pThe calculation is distributed at workbook level, meaning to say, we fill inchange some data in the workbook as a request and run on the cluster then retrieve the results back, and the calculation requires thousands of this kind of work, so distribution at workbook level is the best choice I think.p  pEverything worked fine when the  of core is 8 or 10, in order to do some tests, I increased the  or cores by increasing SubscribedCoreSubscribedSockets, then I had 32 cores. The Excel job submitted to the cluster worked fine at the beginning of the job lifecycle, and after retrieved some resultsincluded in the calculation responses, the calculation seemed stopped and after a while a min or two I got error thrown from server side, saying p  precodeSystem.IO.IOException Found unreadable content in the workbook. Verify that headnodemachinesharedfolderCalcWorkbook.xlsb can be opened manually. gt System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException 0x800A03EC codepre  pLooking at the logs in Event Viewer under MicrosoftHPCExcelHPC Excel Admin Events, there were a lot of such errors asp  precodeError while starting Excel process System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException 0x80080005 Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID 0002450000000000C000000000000046 failed due to the following error 80080005.    at Microsoft.Hpc.Excel.ExcelDriver.LaunchExcelProcess    at Microsoft.Hpc.Excel.ExcelDriver.OpenWorkbookString filePath, Boolean updateLinks, String password, String writeResPassword, Nullable1 lastSaveDate   Session 114, Task 1  ExcelService failed to handle a request on RTG23REM09.
