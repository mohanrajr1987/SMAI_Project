Positive 2904 pI have a fun problem that Im trying to solve. Ive been given a data set from a sensor in Cartesian coordinates. This data is very dense so there is no shortage of points.p  pNow assuming that the origin of this data is at 0,0 I want to find the potential offset of the sensor in that frame. p  pMy attempt was to create the convex hull of this data set, and then check for groups of intersecting lines whichs intersection lies within a certain distance from the origin point. This give a good approximation using this ideal data, a hrefhttpi60.tinypic.com8y6epu.jpg relnofollowClick Mea.p  pIn Link 1 you see a few green lines, these are the Mainline Ive taken from the convex hull that are good candidates to use. There are a lot of them since the image is done from a loop.p  pNow, to my problem. The data I get is noisy so there are many outlying points, that is, points that are really outside the FOV but still get measured. These bad points are few, but enough so that the convex hull approach does not work Ive tried alpha shapes as well, it does work better but still not good enough.p  pI was wondering if you have any ideas to what direction I could go to solve this dilemma Preferably Id like to extract this origin point as binomial distribution.p  pHere is an example image of raw data although Ive changed it and removed data for IP reasons. a hrefhttpi60.tinypic.com8y6epu.jpg relnofollowClick Mea.p  pAn idea I had was maybe work with the data in polar coordinates, and then use dohougs transform to extract clear straight lines in polar coordinates, which could give me a set of arc lengths at a certain distance R and then somehow go from therep  pP.S. Sorry for few links, only allowed to put two here and now images p

Positive 2904 pThe shape and positions of all the polygons are known beforehand. The polygons are not overlapping and will be of different colors and shapes, and there could be quite many of them. The polygons are defined in floating point based coordinates and will be painted on top of a JPEG photo as annotation.p  pHow could I create the resulting image file as fast as possible after I get to know which color I should give each polygonp  pIf it would save time I would like to perform as much as possible of the computations beforehand. All information regarding geometry and positions of the polygons are known in advance. The JPEG photo is also known in advance. The only information not known beforehand is the color of each polygon.p  pThe JPEG photo has a size of 250x250 pixels, so that would also be the image size of the resulting rasterised image.p  pThe computations will be done on a Linux computer with a standard graphics card, so OpenGL might be a viable option. I know there are also rasterisation libraries like a hrefhttpcairographics.org relnofollowCairoa that could be used to paint polygons. What I wonder is if I could take advantage of the fact that I know so much of the input in advance and use that to speed up the computation. The only thing missing is the color of each polygon.p  pPreferably I would like to find a solution that would only precompute things in the form of data files. In other words as soon as the polygon colors are known, the algorithm would load the other information from datafiles JPEG file, polygon geometry file andor possibly precomputed datafiles. Of course it would be faster to start the computation out with a warm state ready in the GPUCPURAM but Id like to avoid that. The choice of programming language is not so import, but could for instance be C.p  pTo give some more background information The JavaScript library a hrefhttpopenseadragon.github.io relnofollowOpenSeadragona that is running in a web browser requests image tiles from a web server. The idea is that measurement points i.e. the polygons could be plotted onthefly on to pregenerated Zooming Images DZI format by the web server. So for one image tile the algorithm would only need to be run one time. The aim is low latency.p
Positive 2904 pFirst of all, I am using Unity3d.p  pWhat is the most efficient in terms of memory way to create a group of 2D tiles with 2D colliders using a texture atlas and tile datap  pBackground Info I am working on a 2D terrain generation asset. It is a very similar generation style to Terrarias random generation. Currently, each tile is being instantiated as a separate GameObject. As I now know, this is extremely inefficient, and I should use a texture atlas and tile data instead. Here is a link to a tutorial I have been following that deals with this in 3D a hrefhttpstudentgamedev.blogspot.co.uk201308unityvoxeltutorialpart1generating.html relnofollowhttpstudentgamedev.blogspot.co.uk201308unityvoxeltutorialpart1generating.htmlap  pThe problem is that strongmesh colliders are 3D colliders 3D colliders CANNOT collide with 2D collidersstrong. Currently in Unity, there are no 2D colliders that I am aware of that have the properties of a mesh I need to dynamically change the 2D collider to adjust to the positions that contain tiles. How am I supposed to develop an efficient 2D tile system using 2D collidersp  pHere are some of my ideas of techniques that may workp  ul liAdd a box collider 2D component to the chunk GameObject for each tile in the chunk.li liSomehow dynamically use a polygon collider 2D to stretch over all solid tiles.li ul  pI have read through several threads and cannot find a good approach for this problem. I am mostly looking for a proven techniqueapproach to this issue, but I am open to any suggestions or techniques. I am happy to provide clarity as needed. Thanks for any answers I appreciate the time you put in to answering my question it helps a tonp

Negative 2904 pCurrently Im developing two drivers for an Arm 9 embedded application.  They are both i2c drivers that each utilize an IO expander pcf8575.  I have tested the drivers independently, but when I compile them both into the kernel and run my main application I get the core dump below.  It doesnt normally occur during the first driver access.  It seems to happen randomly.  It definitely happening when my driver call the i2c driver to transmit on the I2c bus i2cmastersendclient, ampbuff[0], count .  I will attach the main files for my two drivers.  They are similar and both very simple.  I have done a lot of testing of them independently.  I have ruled this out as a hardware issue by getting the same results on two very different pieces of hardware.  I guess Im just not even sure when it says a kernel paging request where to even start looking.  I have trouble believing the problem is in the i2ccore driver, but this is the section of code where it is dying on.  p  precodegt Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 000b9a81 gt
