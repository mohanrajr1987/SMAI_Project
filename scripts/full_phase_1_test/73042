Positive 73042 pWere using the Kendo UI ASP.NET MVC wrappers to render our grids. Ive got localisation working as described in a hrefhttpdocs.telerik.comkendouiaspnetmvcglobalizationlocalization relnofollowthis articlea but the problem I have is that if the browser culture gets resolved as language neutral just language level, for example fr instead of frFR the localisation doesnt work and the grid is rendered as enUS.p  pIs there a simple way of making the wrappers use the localisations in this scenariop  pI guess I could force the culture somehow and in the worst case compile the Kendo dll with additional resources but thought I would ask first.p  pThanks for any pointersp
