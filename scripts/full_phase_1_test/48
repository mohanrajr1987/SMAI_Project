Positive 48 pI am quite new to the world of Big Data and after hours of readings and documentation, I decided to seek your advice. Heres the dealp  pI need to perform strongrealtime analyticsstrong on strongdata from mongoDBstrong collections. My analyzer must be written in an interpreted language preferably in strongPythonstrong.p  pFrom what I read, strongsparkstreamingstrong looked like the perfect tool at first sight. But it appears impossible, at least in Python, to create an input DStream from mongoDB according to the a hrefhttpsspark.apache.orgdocs1.5.0streamingprogrammingguide.htmlcustomsources relnofollowdoca. Is there any alternative such as passing data from mongoDB to spark using Apache Kafka Or should I try another framework like Apache stormp  pIm a bit lost among all these technologies which are new for me. What frameworks would you guys use to implement this analyzerp
Positive 48 pIm working on a social networking website in Rails and currently I can think of a couple ways in which I can implement friendships exactly like Facebook. But since a lot of the applications functionality is going to depend from this part of the application, Im a bit apprehensive about committing to one, and then realizing that I couldve done it better, and then doing migrations and changing the entire thing one by one.p  pIf you guys could suggest which is the best way to go, itll be great. Also, if none of my architectures are good enough, feel free to suggest a new onep  pstrongARCHITECTURE 1strong p  pA single table for friendships that has 3 columns  p  ul liuserid id of the user who sends the requestli lifriendid id of the user who receives the requestli lipending boolean to hold status. False if the request was accepted, true otherwiseli ul  pTo get all friends of the userp  precode  def friends     userids  Friendship.where       userid  id OR friendid  id AND pending  false,        id self.id     .pluckuserid, friendid      .flatten      .uniq      .reject  id id  self.id       users  User.whereid userids   end codepre  pTo get all friend request received by the user  p  precodedef friendrequests   friendids  Friendship.wherefriendid   AND pending  true, self.id.all   users  User.whereid friendids end codepre  pemAdvantages I can think of emp  ul liIt requires the least number of tables and records in the database, as compared to other architectures. Im not sure if this is actually an advantage or not as Ive heard that the number of records in a table doesnt affect performance. So correct me if Im wrong.li liWill require only a couple of validations. First that userid be unique in the scope of friendid. Second that userid is not equal to friendid.li liDRY code. Accepting a friend request requires just finding the record and updating just a single field the boolean  pending. Unfriending requires just finding the record and deleting the itli ul  pemDisadvantages I can think of em p  ul liUser.friends and User.friendrequests are not eagerloadable since they are not actually ActiveRecord associations. That can be a point of major slowdowns, in the long run, especially the search feature where Ill want to rank results by a number of mutual friends.li ul  pstrongARCHITECTURE 2strongp  pTwo tables. One for friendships and one for friend requests   Friendships will be like  p  ul liuserid id of one of the users in the friendshipli lifriendid id of the other user in the friendshipli ul  pFriend Requests table will be also like  p  ul liuserid id of one of the users in the friendshipli lifriendid id of the other user in the friendshipli ul  pTo get all friends of a user  p  precodehasmany friendships,   classname Friendship,   foreignkey userid,   primarykey id  hasmany friends,   through friendships,   source friend codepre  pTo get all friend requests of the user  p  precodehasmany friendrequests,   classname FriendRequest,   foreignkey friendid,   primarykey id codepre  pAdvantages that I can think of are  p  ul liUser.friends and User.friendrequests are eagerloadable. This can improve performances at a lot of places where I to eagerload the friends of a bunch of users in a single query, rather than hitting the database over and over and doing User.friendsli ul  pDisadvantages that I can think of are  p  ul liDuplicate entries for friendships. To make the User.friends association work, Ill have to create 2 entries for a single friendhsip. li ul  hr  precode id   userid  friendid       1     15        30         2     30        15       codepre  ul liWhich will require complicated validations such as validate presence of row 2 in above example if row 1 is persent. And many othersli liCreating a friendship will be complicated. Itll require   ul liDeleting the entry from the friend requests tableli liCreating 2 rows in the friends tableli liI know it doesnt sound like a real disadvantage but to me it just seems like a lot could go wrong when creatingdeleting 3 entries that depend on each otherli ulli ul  pI guess in the end the question boils down to  p  pDoes having a lower number half of entries in the database architecture 1 have significant advantages over more entries architecture 2p  pand p  pHow bad is it to have 2 entries for a single friendship architecture 2p

Positive 48 pWe are developing an mvc web application and UI will be responsive, so dont see any future requirement with web services required for native app that will consume services. However if we want to use Angular js in the future on the client side then yes it is required. p  pNow the questions is p  pWill the performance better in case we use project libraries Service library not web api instead of using REST services created in Web api Or there will not be much difference if we use rest servicesp  pI believe including reference of service project libraries would be the best option if rest services are not required. As when request from client goes to server it dont need another http request for calling rest services. p
Positive 48 pI am looking to develop a desktop application which functions as a tool for a purpose to my users. I wish this application to connect to my web server to authenticate a user, and so the user could save the project  data  work on the server.p  pI would have a site for it with a database and Spring MVC, Hibernate, etc..., and I was thinking of using HTTP data communication, such as browsers do. User authentication would be done as a POST, and the data could be sent and returned in JSON. I will develop the program with Java, and Im considering using the a hrefhttpshc.apache.org relnofollowHttp Componentsa library, from Apache.p  pUsing NIO, or Sockets libraries might not be good for me I dont know, because I would have another kind of complexity to work on the server, and frankly I do not know how I would do it. I would have to leave perhaps two server programs running... I do not know how I would do it on the same machine  server. Anyway...p  pI want to know what is the current September, 2015 and recommended options for achieving this with Java, and I will consider an answer as correct if it contains current and real alternatives no mater how many that are functional, and with a proper bibliography.p  pstrongNOTEstrong The use of HTTP was only one option mentioned by me. If there is something better, or more recommended, or optional, please...p  pstrongSome things to considerstrongp  ul liSafe data transmission user authentication data. li liTransmission of possible megabytes of data.li liScalability.li ul  h2EDITh2  pIm editing my question to clarify a few things. Again, we suffer from the use of the internet, where we do not see the tone in a speech or text, and the authors face. I did not want to be rude, arrogant, or mean. I apologize right now if anyone felt offended by it. Other than that, my native language is not English. I use a translator google and the little knowledge I have to be able to communicate with people, trying to be as clear, simple and direct as possible, because I know that everyone here has their lives and their occupations. I feel I have to mention this because in my omission, I would be in agreement with what was said to me. I came here on a mission of peace, and information, as well as all my other colleagues in this community.p  pRegarding my question, I believe there is some misunderstanding as to it being too vague  broad, or based on opinions. I remind you that there is no single way to effect a due action, much less one way to be the best among others, even in the field of exact sciences. How often we do not see more than one acceptable answer here in this community How often we did not see correct answers considered by users to be barred by other responses with a greater number of votes And yet, only for an answer have fewer votes than another does not necessarily mean that it is disposable. We still gain with content on it. If it was not the way we are used to here, a question would have only a single correct answer, where only one answer would be given. p  pI presented a real situation, plausible, which Im going through and I believe many other users also pass through it. I was carefulcriterioso not arrogant, of course, because facts were presented. I do not have unlimited resources in my budget to effect any kind of solutions. It is quite possible that some solutions are best for my case than others. Each case is different.p

Positive 48 pI have two classes that share the same flow I need to get info from the DB, process it and update it on a nosql DB.p  pThe difference is very small in one case I am sure I will get only one entity for each nosql record, so I can just process them, store them temporarily in a list and then get all the items in the list after the entities were processed.p  pIn the second case I can have more than one entity for each index record. In this case I have to retrieve the current processed data, merge, and store again. After every entity was processed I am able to get the map.values so I can update to the nosql.p  pAs seen the difference is only on how the items are processed and how the data structure is temporarily stored.p  pMy parent class has something like thisp  precodepublic void run      process     sendToNosqlgetProcessed   protected abstract void process protected abstract ListltStuffgt getProcessed codepre  pThe simple children is something like thisp  precodeListltStuffgt myStuff  new ArrayListltgt Override protected void process      forEntity e  loadFromDB         myStuff.addprocesse        Override protected ListltStuffgt getProcessed     return myStuff  codepre  pAnd the complex onep  precodeMapltint, Stuffgt myStuff  new HashMapltgt Override protected void process      forEntity e  loadFromDB         myStuff.pute.getId, processe        Override protected ListltStuffgt getProcessed     return myStuff.values  codepre  pBecause everything will be processed and the results will be used later, myStuff is an object attribute.
