Positive 5992 pI have a SQL stored proc which is supposed to be executed by multiple users. Every user will execute this proc on the same server and same database. During the execution, it will create global temp tables and drop them at the end for example, codetemp1code, codetemp2code, etc.. When the proc creates the global temp tables, it uses the following codep  precodeIF OBJECTIDtempDB..temp1 IS NOT NULL         DROP TABLE temp1 codepre  pSo my question is, when codeUser Acode created codetemp1code and codetemp2code, codeUser Bcode starts on another machine and start to create his codetemp1code. According to the above code, codetemp1code will be removed from the database if exists. Will this operation affects codeUser Acode If the users are affecting each other, is there a way to avoid itp  pMany thanks.p

Positive 5992 pI have a set of configuration variables not environment specific that need to be wrapped in a class that exposes them to the rest of the application. If all I wanted to expose was the values, I could load them via a YAML file  expose on the Rails config object, however I want the class to offer a simple API that combines  manipulates these pieces of data. This data will never change after initialisation, but needs to be used in numerous places. Storing it in the database seems like unnecessary complexity.p  pI initially experimented with storing state on a class and accessing it via class methods codeExample.gettercode, but this is problematic in development due to class reloading blowing away the state. The same is true for Singletons.p  pAnother alternative is storing them on an instance of a class, but where should that instance live I could add it to the Rails config object and access it there, but using the config object as some kind of registry doesnt feel right codeRails.application.config.example.gettercode and is very verbose.p  pHow should I store this kinds of configuration so it is easy to access from within the applicationp

Positive 5992 pI need the way to store some data globally in Clojure. But I cant find the way to do that. I need to load some data in runtime and put it to a global pool of objects, to manipulate with it later. This pool should be accessed inside some set of functions to setget data from it like a some sort of small inmemory database with hashlike syntax to access.p  pI know that it might be bad pattern in functional programming, but I dont know other way to store dynamic set of objects to accessmodifyreplace it in runtime. java.util.HashMap is some sort of solution, but it couldnt be accessed with sequence functions and I miss flexibility of Clojure when I need to use this kind of collection.
