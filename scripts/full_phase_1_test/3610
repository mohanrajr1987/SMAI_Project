Positive 3610 pC provides two similar provisions to perform the same task.While object composition seems more convenient as the declared class can be used for some other class as well.p  pEg. An Address class can contain some properties and functions and then be used as a property of a Student class. Alternatively,the Address class can be declared inside the Student classnested.p  pemSo my doubt is,which of these methods should be used and when Also is one considered a better approach than the otheremp

Negative 3610 pI am trying to use CoreFoundataion containers. It seems to be a really convenient way when accessing property list. However, I notice that its really awkward to access internal containers if the container is nested  for example, A CFArrayRef contains a CFDictionaryRef, which then has a key whose value is another CFArrayRef. Maybe a graph below demonstrate a little better.p  precodeCFArrayRef a      CFDictionaryRef b assume its at index 2 of a                    CFArrayRef c assume, they key value is array codepre  pSo lets say we got an CFArrayRef a And I want to access the element at CFIndex 0 in CFArrayRef cp  pI have to type something like thisp  precodeCFArrayGetValueAtIndexCFArrayRefCFDictionaryGetValueCFDictionaryRefCFArrayGetValueAtIndexa, 2, CFSTRarray, 0 codepre  pThat looks to me is a lot of typing. My guess is that CoreFoundation is based on C rather than C, so it doesnt provide operator overloading like [] to access its element.p  pIs there a way to make this access easier on typing maybe for reading as wellp  pI am using C, i am considering overload the operator [] for certain CFTypeRef such as CFArrayRef, CFDictionaryRef, CFStringRef, not sure if its a good idea.p

Negative 3610 pWe have a TAP environment with a lot of shell scripts running on Solaris. At this moment, only the Production and Acceptance environment are really used because its too complicated to keep track of all the changes we do.p  pTherefore I was thinking about introducing version control, but I dont really have an idea of how to implement this.p  pI was initially thinking about using SVN with Trac and to create a single repository for the whole environment. Use trunk for the Production environment, and creating branches for the Test and Acceptance environment. p  pWed develop in the Test branch, test it in the Acceptance branch and eventually merge it with Trunk for Production.p  pAfter doing some research, Ive found that Git might be better suited in combination with Redmine.

Negative 3610 pI am new to iOS programming and ObjectiveC. I need to code a simple application which will tweet from a specific Twitter account.

Unfortunately when I code it like that, the MGTwitterEngine doesnt send the tweet if it strongis notstrong on the first View Controller.p  pI have tried also to add a method in the first View Controller interface and implementation files. which then can be called by the other View Contollers. like thisp  precodevoidtweetfix  [engine sendUpdateprueba tweetfix] [self updateStreamnil] codepre  pBut that doesnt work either. What can I do so I can tweet from those other Views that are not the first View Controller. Thank you for your attention.p

Negative 3610 pThis one will be quick, I have to make a program that checks to see if a password is valid or not.
