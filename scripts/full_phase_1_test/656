Positive 656 pI have a repomirrorb which is an svn mirror of repo A. I also have repomirrorc which is a mirror of repomirrorb. Now am taking down the repomirrorb and creating a new repobwith the same UUID as repomirrorB. repomirrorc should now mirror new repob. p  pAm using the same repository name for repomirrorb and repob and same UUID.p  pShould I change any settings for repomirrorc or will it be unaffected by this change Should I restart the system where repomirrorc is hosted Should users delete all checkouts of repomirrorc and checkout freshp  pAnything else that I should be careful about Thanksp

Positive 656 pIm fairly new to SVN Tortoise, and Im having some trouble understanding the combination of revisions and externals.p  pThe SVN project Im working on has several externals. Some of them are tags and a few point to the trunk of other SVN library projects.p  pWhen I try to roll back and look at an older revision of the project, it seems like what I check out is not exactly as it was a few weeks ago. The externals that point to the trunk of a library project are not rolled back, but contain the newest changes.p  pShould all externals point to tags of other projects, and if they dont, does it mean that you cant easily get a snapshot of a previous revision p
Positive 656 pI like using a hrefhttpwinmerge.orglangen relnofollowWinMergea instead of TortoiseMerge with TortoiseSVN for comparing changes between separate revisions of a file.  I can configure this for most things in the TortoiseSVN settings context menu  TortoiseSVN  Settings  Diff Viewerp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comSMlVE.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comSMlVE.png altenter image description hereap  pHowever, when I want to compare files in a particular revision against the those in the working copy, it uses TortoiseMerge.  To see what I mean, go to the TortoiseSVN log viewer from the working copy rightclick in the working copy folder, select TortoiseSVN  Show log, rightclick on a prior revision, and select Compare with working copy.  Then, doubleclick the file of interest in the list of file patches that appears.p  pIs there any way to get it to use WinMerge instead of TortoiseMerge for these casesp
Positive 656 pThis happens to me all the time when merging, and Im really not sure why I saw several answers detailing several possible causes but the cause is not relevant for my question, because regardless of what causes tree conflicts on identical files in identical paths the result is always the same nothing at all needs to be changed and the conflict can just be marked as resolved.p  pSo every time I have a tree conflict I have to [checkout the source file if its not already there,] use a diff tool like WinDiff because being that a emtreeem conflict no SVN client opens its diff tool, although both files are there, compare the two files to find out whether they are identical they almost always are and if yes just mark the conflict as resolved without making absolutely any change to solve the conflict.p  pObviously this is very very timewasting and it feels really frustrating and pointless.p  pSo Im wondering if there is any way  through some SVN switch or some SVN client or anything else  to make so that tree conflicts wont be flagged in cases where its 100 sure that nothing at all needs to be changed in order to solve the conflict  like in the case of my example above.p  pstrongADDEDstrong It would also be interesting for me to know how usual it is for people to get tree conflicts on identical files BTW Im talking about files that emnobodyem has touched since I created my branch, neither deleted nor recreated nor modified nor moved nor anything else. So you are welcome to leave a comment if you experienced that.p
Positive 656 pHow Can i redo reverts on Svnp
Positive 656 pIn my work they are using a system in Java that works as a TFS. We also use a plugin in eclipse to handle the versions of the projects.

If possible, what can be used  Thanks.p
