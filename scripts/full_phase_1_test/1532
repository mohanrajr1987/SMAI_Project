Positive 1532 pI was referencing the a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRxmlschema2decimal relnofollowXSD speca today looking up the definition of a decimal type. In it, I found two different conflicting definitions of the datatype, a lexical definition and a canonical definition quoted belowp  blockquote   pem3.2.3.1 Lexical representationemp      pstrongdecimalstrong has a lexical representation consisting of a finitelength   sequence of decimal digits x30x39 separated by a period as a   decimal indicator. An optional leading sign is allowed. If the sign is   omitted,  is assumed. Leading and trailing zeroes are optional.   strongIf the fractional part is zero, the period and following zeroes can be omitted.strong For example 1.23, 12678967.543233, 100000.00,   210.p      pem3.2.3.2 Canonical representationemp      pThe canonical representation for strongdecimalstrong is defined by prohibiting   certain options from the Lexical representation 3.2.3.1.   Specifically, the preceding optional  sign is prohibited. strongThe   decimal point is required.strong Leading and trailing zeroes are   prohibited subject to the following there must be at least one digit   to the right and to the left of the decimal point which may be a zero.p blockquote  pIn summary, the lexical representation permits the absence of a decimal point and trailing zeros if the fractional part of the decimal is zero, whereas the canonical representation explicitly states the decimal is required.p  pWhich of these definitions is correct My application is sending lexical representation and a consuming application is expecting canonical representation.p

Negative 1532 pIs there any way to get the same value from which PHP generates output from rand Because it is not really random, so if I could get to same starting value as some another script, all numbers going afterwards should be same. Is there any way how to achieve thisp  phr EDIT OK, again. PHP has function coderandmin, maxcode, that returns random number. However, nothing in computer is random. In reality, at the beginning, there is a seed. Seed is some number. Using some complicated algorithm, it generates some number, which appears random. p  pBut truth is, if you support same seed, you will get same numbers as the other computer does. So my questions basically was, can you guess this seed and feed it to your own coderandcode function, so you can predict next numberp
