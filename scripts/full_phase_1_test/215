Positive 215 pI am running an app in Tomcat 8. The http resource is hosted by IIS server 8. I use BonCode AJP 1.3 connector.p  pMy app will run on this url a hrefhttplocalhost8080myapp relnofollowhttplocalhost8080myappap  ul liIf users type a hrefhttplocalhost relnofollowhttplocalhosta...., it will try to grab resource from IIS server.li liIf users type a hrefhttplocalhostmyapp relnofollowhttplocalhostmyappa..., it will go to my application.li ul  pSo p  ul lipIf I run the app by using url with port number, such as a hrefhttplocalhost8080myappmypage.jsp relnofollowhttplocalhost8080myappmypage.jspa, everything works as expected. Images staying in myapp can be retrieved properly.pli lipIf I run the app without port number, such as a hrefhttplocalhostmyappmypage.jsp relnofollowhttplocalhostmyappmypage.jspa, most things work correctly because I used BonCode AJP 1.3 connector to make a hrefhttplocalhostmyapp relnofollowhttplocalhostmyappa to be treated as  a hrefhttplocalhost8080myapp relnofollowhttplocalhost8080myappa so that whatever request comes on Port 80 can be also diverted to Port 8080 automatically. But it failed to retrieve resource such as images, javascript, etc from myapp. pli ul  pI will use an better example to explain the problem I encountered. I think that would be easier to understand my question.p  pFor instance, if I have an image called testImage.png inside my app.  I am able to retrieve it by typing this url in browser a hrefhttplocalhost8080myapptestImage.png relnofollowhttplocalhost8080myapptestImage.pngap  pBut I am not able to retrieve it via this url without port number a hrefhttplocalhostmyapptestImage.png relnofollowhttplocalhostmyapptestImage.pnga The browser will throw this errorp  pstrongFailed to load resource netERRTOOMANYREDIRECTSstrongp  pIs there some setting in Tomcat, IIS server or the connector that I need to change to make it workp  pstrongUpdatestrong I should rephrase my question, which might be very simple.p  pHow to make users access the static files such as images files contained in servlet via IIS  I guess I need to add some handlers to IISp

Positive 215 pIve been involved in a project using SAPUI5 recently. My web background so far has mainly been developing ASP MVC apps but Ive never really bothered to go very deep, to understand how ASP apps are being set up behind the scenes. p  pRecently, Ive seen a need for the client side JavaScript code to query the local IIS for various systemrelated information, such as the Windows user ID etc. So, I thought a web service would be the natural approach.p  pHowever, since the web site isnt set up to handle ASP web services I cant make that work out of the box. Just adding a web service to the web site automatically creates an AppCode folder to host the C implementation files but when the client calls a service it just gets a 404 back, so I assume the routing doesnt work.p  pSo, my question is What do I need to do for an existing website to start accepting and route incoming web service calls Is it possible to add this functionality to an existing website, or do I need to start over and create an ASP MVC or WebApi applicationp

Negative 215 pGood day. Im implementing the Complex class in C with Mono under Ububntu 14.04.

Complex a  new Complex 1, 1 double b  2.0 Complex c  b  a ... codepre  pThe strange behavior is that the operator  returns the wrong result. I noticed that when  is called the argument of type double has the wrong value within the function I pass b  2 and I see that the argument k has a random value.p  pI have also tried to implement the function without using operatorsp  precode... public Complex Multiplydouble k return new Complex k  re, k  im  ... codepre  pand alsop  precode... public static Complex Multiply double k, Complex x return new Complex k  x.re, k  x.im  ... codepre  pbut I obtain alwais the same behavior.
