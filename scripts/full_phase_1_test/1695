Positive 1695 pSeems like a basic question but it is very important to decide how it should be. Here is the scenariop  pI have a table ABC and other table Categoryp  pABC contains the basic information which is common among all the Vendors ABC will have the CategoryID in it Then I have a table named ABCCatA this table has specific information which is not common to all the tables. Similarly I will have table ABCCatB having specific fieldp  pOr can I just use table ABC and add all the fields even specific fields in the same table to avoid joins and one table for each categoryp  pHow can I model this structure in relational DB p

Positive 1695 pIve recently built messaging functionality into my site, my current tables are designed as followsp  pThis is basically the users sent box, when one user contacts another it first inserts a record into this table and then outputs the inserted.id which is then inserted into MessageRecipient tablep  precodeCREATE TABLE [MailBox].[Message] [Id] [bigint] IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL, [SenderId] [bigint] NOT NULL,  foreign key to user table [Message] [nvarchar]max NOT NULL, [SentDate] [datetime] NOT NULL, [DeletedDate] [datetime] NULL, codepre  pThis one is basically the users inboxp  precodeCREATE TABLE [MailBox].[MessageRecipient] [Id] [bigint] IDENTITY1,1 NOT NULL, [MessageId] [bigint] NOT NULL,  foreign key to table above [RecipientId] [bigint] NOT NULL,  foreign key to user table [ReadDate] [datetime] NULL, [DeletedDate] [datetime] NULL, codepre  pNow Im not experiencing any issues with this, but from my experience just because something works doesnt mean its the correct way to do it. Im curious to find out if theirs a better way of doing this reason I ask is because my knowledge on SQL is limited and Ive basically be crawling the web looking for examples and the above is what Ive ended up with.p  pThese two tables may potentially grow which may cause issues with performance and also by the looks of it they dont really seem to be very flexible I maybe thinking this because of my lack on knowledge on SQLp  pSo Im asking for some expert advice from a DBA or maybe someone similar in regards to how I should design such architecture for the messaging functionality.p  pExamples would help me tremendously.p

Positive 1695 pHow would you maintain duplicate phone numbers across both tables  p  pIn writing this, I realized why not separate the mobile phone number column into a separate table, and use foreign key constraints where the mobile phone number table stores the ph and a key column that references the unique key in both the person and descendants key column.  That way I can create a constraint on the mobile phone number table to not store duplicates for the ph column.p  pIs this the only possible solution or are there other ways to go about it  I think this would be the preferred solution, correctp  pThanks.p

Positive 1695 pAssume I need to design a data model where I store address changes of persons. I can think of two ways to implement it updating the persons document or, inserting a new document representing the change.p  pWith the update approach, each person has one document which includes an array of addresses and an address is added to the array when the persons address changes.p  pWith the insert approach, there may be multiple documents per person. Each document represents the address change of the concerned person.p  pAssume the only person information stored in the documents is the persons unique identifier and the addresses. I precise it so that data duplication with the insert approach is considered negligible.p  pWhich approach is recommended when MongoDB is used as databasep
Positive 1695 pI am designing DATABASE for a Sales and Purchase application like ERP and using MYSQL as RDBMS, I have doubt on creating table for sales and purchase entities to go with single table for each moduleSalePurchase or multiple tables for each entitiesSales order, Sale invoice, Sale return, Purchase order, Purchase invoice, Purchase return in longer run. Below is my use case.p  pMy application will have Sale Order, Sale Delivery, Sale Invoice, Sale Return and Credit Note and same entity for Purchase module also and all these entity may be enter linked in there module. Like Sale Order can be converted into Sale Delivery or Sale Order and Sale Delivery can be converted into Sale Invoice. So there need to maintain reference bw each entity of a module.p  pNow, I am little confuse to keep all this in one table for each module say saleentity and purchaseentity having entity type Or should I create separate table for each entity type say saleorder, saleinvoice, salereturn, purchaseorder, purchaseinvoice, purchasereturn etc.p  pBelow is what running in my mind for both the casesp  pstrongSingle Tablestrong I really want to keep this in single table for each module but I am worry about performance in longer run, It will increase the table size quickly and may slow down the performance.p  pstrongMultiple tablestrong It will be difficult to manage, maintain relationships and fetching data in reports for all entity types of records at once, requires union and all.p  pMy understanding is that large size of table performs slower than the small size of table, Please correct if I am wrong.p  pPlease put some light on it, and suggest me how should I proceed.p  pThank Youp
