Positive 1478 pI am writing a distributed programming framework and I have reached a wall on what it comes to templated object declaration and creation on client side. The problem is that I have a object that I need to create in the client side of the network. Somewhere in the client I havep  pAt Server Sidep  precodetemplate lttypename Tgt class myRemoteObject     myRemoteObjectltTgt          tells client to create an object of type T         sendCreateObject encodeTypeT       This is working        int main     ...     myRemoteObject obj     ...  codepre  pAt the client sidep  precodecase message.type     OBJTYPEINT         objPtr  new myObjectltintgt         break     OBJTYPEFLOAT         objPtr  new myObjectltfloatgt         break  codepre  pThat brings me lots of problems. First, it is strongnot flexiblestrong because I have to explicitly declare every type I use inside my framework statically, if I want to also use containers vector etc I also would have to explicetly instantiate them.p  pSecond, it is very strongslowstrong to compile. myObject has a lot of templated functions and compiling just 4 of those instantiations would occupy 1.5G of ram and would take a while too. I got to the point that it would occupy 6GB of RAM and take more than 1h never finished.p  pSo, I opted for strongexplicit instantiationstrong. I created several .cpp files 12 that explicetly instantiated myObject with different types, declared myObject templates in a separate file and included just the .h containig template signatures in the code cited before. Although, that sill limits the frameworks capabilities andp  pstrongAnybody knows a way to do that purely as a templatestrong So I need to instantiate only the types being used by the main program I tried to put the instantiation of myObject inside myRemoteObject, but it didnt work...p  pps. I am using C2011p
Positive 1478 pI hope some one can help me a little here. I am relatively new to C and also to the concept of Templates.  I need to create a stdfunction based on some data that I am getting in a list.  The signature of the function should be according to the data available.

Make any sense p  precodestdvectorltboostvarientltint, char, stdstringgtgt list arglist  typeparserltintgt   all functions have int return, so start with return int and 0 args forboostvarientltint, char, stdstringgt a  list      ifa.type   typeidint         arglist.addArgint  now add int to list of args      else      ifa.type typeidchar         arglist.addchar      else     if a.type typeidbla          arglist.addbla          end for  now create the function here  stdfunctionltarglistgt f  load from library codepre  pDoes this even seem possible Maybe I am looking at the problem in the wrong way Any thing will help at this time.

Positive 1478 pIve been searching all morning for answers to no avail. Im building a one page WordPress template.

Negative 1478 pThis is my first time posting and I am new to using VBA code in excel.p  pI am looking for the simplest way to understand and use code to make my userform functional.

On that sheet are two columns. Column A named Letters and Column B named Numbers. In Column A range A2  A, A3  B, A4  C, A5  D.

Negative 1478 pIve heard that the only reason why GCC and LLVM based compilers dont use SEH for exception handling on x86 windows is that it is patented by Borland.
