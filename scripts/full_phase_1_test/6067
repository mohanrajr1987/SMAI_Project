Positive 6067 pI have to handle large textfiles. I known and make sure that they only use  codes lt 255. So one byte like in the old days is enough. String and Character types are open to all languages. So I assume they will need much more than only one byte per letter. Is there a setting to use the small risky version of characters and strings in SWIFT p
Positive 6067 pI have a data frame and I want to transform the first column by using a function that I wrote called group1p  precodegroup1 lt functionx    temp lt strsplitx,[[1]][2]   temp lt gsubYellow, , temp   temp lt gsubBlue, , temp   as.numerictemp  codepre  pFor instance, applying this function on the string MHYBlue23Yellow1611A should yield the result 23. This is indeed what happens when the input is just a string, but when I try to apply this function on a character vector, something goes wrong. I tried to use transform to make it work on each element in the vectorp  precodedatalingRT2 lt transformdatalingRT, Group1  group1CodeTrials codepre  pBut instead of getting a data frame with a new column called Group1 that depends on the respective element in CodeTrials, I get that all of the elements in Group1 are based only on the first element of CodeTrials. I guess this has to do with the way I have written group1, but I couldnt find what I did wrong. Using ddply is even worse  sometimes I dont even get anything at all in the column Group1...p  pI would highly appreciate your helpp
