Positive 729 pI am trying to convert the above statement to LINQ. I have multiple tables with an identifier in the first column and I need to multiply them so that I get a table as a result where all possible combinations are shown e.g. table 1  2 rows, table 2  2 rows, table 3  2 rows, resulting table 222  8 rows.p  pIf I have a sqlite db I used to do it in this wayp  precodestring sql  SELECT  FROM tab1,tab2,tab3 SQLDataAdapter adapter  new SQLiteDataAdaptersql, con adapter.Fillds.Tables[1] codepre  pNow the db is not longer a sqlite db but a dataset. This dataset contains the tab1,tab2,tab3 etc. Now I would like to do the same as before  multiply the tables. How can this be done with a dataset by using LINQ if possiblep

Positive 729 pIm using Entity Framework and have just learned about the codeTransactionScopecode class from codeSystem.Transactionscode. These ambient transactions seem to be used automatically for all new database connections that are opened within the transaction scope. People who use this seem to use shortlived database connections as well. It seems that multiple connections can be part of the same transaction that way.p  pBut I need to use transactions as well for a few lowlevel commands on an existing database connection. Im used to the more traditional approach where you open a database connection, keep it for the runtime of the application mostly desktop, and run your commands on that single connection. Therefore I create my own codeDbCommandcode instances just like it was with ADO.NET alone before EF. These commands have a codeTransactioncode property that can be set to a codeDbTransactioncode instance, obtained from the connections codeBeginTransactioncode method.p  pHow does this work together with the codeSystem.Transactions.Transactioncode class How can I add selfmade database commands to such an ambient transactionp  pIve tried with the codeDbConnection.EnlistTransactioncode method, but that would be called for every command I create. While SQL Server happily accepts that, PostgreSQL Npgsql rejects it with the reason that it doesnt support nested transactions. But its still the same transaction instance that I use here. SQLite basically works, too, but fails when passing codenullcode, which would mean no transaction.p  pIm looking for a solution that lets me use codeDbCommandcode with the Entity Framework transactions mechanism that supports many major ADO.NET providers.p
Positive 729 pIf a codeSqlConnectioncode throws an exception during execution inside a codeusingcode statement, do I need to manually close the connection in a codefinallycode  or will the scope of the codeusingcode statement call the codeDisposecode method on the codeSqlConnectioncode for me ... which therefore executes the code.Closecode method for me automaticallyp  pfor examplep  precodeusing var sqlConnection  new SqlConnectionconnectionString     sqlConnection.Open     throw new Exceptionboom  codepre  pvsp  precodeusing var sqlConnection  new SqlConnectionconnectionString      try              sqlConnection.Open          throw new Exceptionboom          finally              sqlConection.Close       codepre  pAlso, does wrapping this in a codeTransactionScopecode  an exception is throw, affect how I should code.Closecode or the codeusingcode scope autodoes this for me.p
Positive 729 pI would like to create a new DataView by filtering an existing DataView, however Im having trouble since DataView does not have a .AsEnumerable method and does not implement IEnumerableDataRow.p  pHere is basically what I want to accomplishp  precodeSome table.

Positive 729 pWe have a service layer in our application which is composed of three logical layers  web service, business model services our name for the layer that executes business logic and orchestrates calls to various repositories, and the repository layer which connects to various DBs using EF6.  p  pMany of our repository calls just get data straight from DB sets via ToListAsync, FirstOrDefaultAsync, like thisp  precodepublic async TaskltMyObjectgt GetSomeData      usingvar context  new myDBContext              return await context.SomeDbSet.FirstOrDefaultogto.Something  true         codepre  pWere having a bit of an internal debate as to whether using await here is the right thing to do or not, because there is nothing executing in this method after the await.  Iwe understand that the way the code is written, it is a necessity otherwise the context would be disposed of as soon as the method exists and it would result in an exception.  But if we await here, we have to await all the way up or down, depending on how you look at it our call stack, and that would result in a number of expensive and somewhat unnecessary context switches. p  pThe other option here is to make the repository methods synchronous, and do a codeTask.Runcode in the method that calls the repository method, likep  precodeTask.Run gt MyRepository.GetSomeData codepre  pwe can then await this call if we want, or just return the task object again to the caller.  The downside here is the call to the database then becomes synchronous and one thread from the pool is blocking for the entire length of the database call.p  pSo this comes down to whats more expensive  Unnecessary context switches via await or having threads block  It seems that there is no right answer, but is there a best practicep  pAny thoughts would be appreciated. p
