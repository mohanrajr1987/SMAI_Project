Positive 11373 pI have set up a UITableViewController with a Container View as header view in Interface Builder. The header view has a height of 180pxp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comzrKLN.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comzrKLN.png altenter image description hereap  pUnfortunately, at runtime the height of the Container View is just 116pxp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comJo1Xl.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJo1Xl.jpg altenter image description hereap  pIf I replace the Container View in the table head with a standard view, say UILabel, the height of the header view I set in Interface Builder is correctly honoured. But this somehow doesnt work with Container Views.p  pAdjust Scroll View Insets doesnt help because it just moves the overflowing part of the image under the Navigation Bar, the height of the Container view is still wrong.p  pAny ideas Thanksp

Negative 11373 pAlright, I recently wrote a ajax push script which had php on the backend sleeping while waiting for someone to make an update. However, the sleeping processes took up a lot of cpu. Any ideas on how I can prevent this I am guessing I will have to either find a program which can do the sleeping with threads or write my own in python or c which I am not very familiar with. I am using ajax push for a browser based game so people can play it in real time but I think if I get too many sleeping processes on the backend it would overload the server.p
