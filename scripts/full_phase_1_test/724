Positive 724 h2Questionh2  p There is the test code I used at the end herep  pI would be very happy to have two questions answeredp  p1. What are the present official policies about read and write file permissionsp  p2. How do I get read and write permissions of user work files on the sdcard p  pI have a feeling this is all bout API versions and not unit types. p  pIt looks like the permissions have changed quite a lot during the development of different Android versions and the way to handle them. Articlesquestions about them are spread for many years and obviously most of them are obsolete and deprecated, but still there in the stackoverflow environment. The changes can be read about in version reviews etc. But even the main developer support site seems to be obsolete and deprecated like a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsdatadatastorage.htmlfilesExternal relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicsdatadatastorage.htmlfilesExternalap  h2Scopeh2  pI am making a bookkeeping accounting app in Android from a working Win32 program in C. New user Android interface. p  pFor this type of applications certainly user files are to be transferred between users be public like word processing files. Should be downloaded over ftp or html but also by attaching an Android unit to a PC and just dragn drop them. And in fact a lot of Apps do read and write files in like the sdcard and sdcarddownload locations. p  pWithout sdcard writeread, a large number of application types are not possible under the Android OS. And this is especially odd when the Android x86 project made it possible to equip cheap netbooks with keyboards and no touchscreen with Android OS and very smooth user and sales opportunities a true Windowskiller alternative. And very efficient travelling office tool. There are for instance good MS Office competitors and just a matter of time until there is an official Android MS Office available. Internet, social media and mail is there and what else do people usep  h2Resultsh2  pUsing 10.1 WXGA tablet emulator API23 and a Samsung TAB3 7 tablet API17.p  pRunning it on internal storage no problem reading, writing and deleting files however huge problems getting test user data files to the internal storage from outside however the emulator allowed it with adbcommands. p  pRunning on external storage it is possible to read files but not write files.p  pRunning on the sdcarddownload or sdcard folders the emulator API23 refused both read and writing  but the TAB3 allowed reading but refused writing.p  pOne remarkable thing is that files denied to be written over or appended are possible to delete with the file.delete call as soon as they are possible to read p  h2Testsh2  pI started with jni ANSI C file functions. But to make it simpler and easier to use Android experience from the past I changed to use Java code instead, testing.

This involves writing to a different file and not to the same file that was just read. The name of file being written to is the name of file that was just read appended by a sequence number. p  precode  string fileName  hiddenField1.Value   string state  null   int i  0   while i lt 20      try           state  File.ReadAllTextServer.MapPathstring.Formatstate0, fileName       catch Exception ex2          log exception         Elmah.ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext.Raiseex2         if even retry doesnt work then throw an exception         if i  19              throw                  sleep for a few milliseconds         System.Threading.Thread.Sleep10          i       i  0   while i lt 20      try          FILE SEQUENCING         Change the file to which state is written, so no concurrency errors happen          between reading from and writing to same file. This is a foolproof solution.         Since max value of integer is more than 2 billion i.e. 2,147,483,647         so we can be sure that our sequence will never run out of limits because an ASP.Net page         is not going to postback 2 billion times         if fileName.LastIndexOfseq gt 0              fileName  fileName.Substring0, fileName.LastIndexOfseq  4  1  int.ParsefileName.SubstringfileName.LastIndexOfseq  4  1  1          else              fileName  fileName  seq1                  change the file name so in next read operation the new file is read         hiddenField1.Value  fileName         File.WriteAllTextServer.MapPathstring.Formatstate0, fileName, newState       catch Exception ex2          log exception         Elmah.ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext.Raiseex2         if even retry doesnt work then throw an exception         if i  19              throw                  sleep for a few milliseconds         System.Threading.Thread.Sleep10          i    codepre  pThe only downside to above approach is that many files would get created as end users post back to the same ASP.Net page.

Negative 724 pI have a flash browser application that loads in a child swf using a Loader object. p  pThe child swf has a mouseclick listener that calls nativateToUrl, and opens a new web page. It also contains mouse hover events that make things in the swf move around. p  pThis application that does the loading is like a container for the child swf and should open a emdifferentem web page when it is clicked. So essentially I want to suppress the child swf mouseEvent and listen for the mouse click on the container swf, opening the new URL. p  pI have heard of other people putting an invisible sprite over the original content so that the child swf doesnt actually catch a mouseclick event. However, this wont work in my case because then it doesnt get the mouse hover events either. I want the mousehover events to go through and make the things in the child swf move but also suppress the click event. p  pSo, for all the flash masterminds out there... is this possible And how can I do it p  p thanks. p

Negative 724 pLooking for some guidance on best practices for SharePoint 2010 deployment. As of right now, our company has one Production server and 1 staging server that both run SharePoint 2010 Standard edition and me and 2 other developers have SharePoint standalone installed on our machines with Visual Studio 2010 installed.p  pI have found a lot of documentation on either deploying it, but stopping at the development level, which is great until you are ready for production OR very odd 10 step instructions on deploying to production or staging after you have tested and are ready to deploy not on your machine, but the actual server. Some say us a CAB file, some talk about a WSP file, but copying it to one place then editing files and it seems like there should be a like 2 step process tops to deploy an update to a web part. Anyone have a nice little best practices guide to this that Im not finding p  pI was also wondering, if you use the deploy feature to deploy locally, isnt there some way that you can change where you are deploying like an ASP.NET Publishp  pPlease help.p
