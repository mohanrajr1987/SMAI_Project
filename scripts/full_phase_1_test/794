Positive 794 pI am developing a logic core to perform data transfer between a FPGA and a PC over ethernet, using a LAN8710 PHY on my FPGA board.p  pIve achieved to transfer some UDP data packets from the FPGA to the PC. Its a simple core that complies with the PHY transfer requirements. It builds the UDP package and transfer it to the PC.p  pTo check the reception on the PC, I am using Wireshark and as said above, I receive the packets correctly. Ive checked the reception with a simple UDP receiver written by myself.p  pBut, Ive noticed that I only receive these packets when Wireshark is running on the PC.

method which indicates some kind of error, it always times out. Maybe the problem comes from the connection configuration, Ive tried several read trial and error and none worked, surprisingly I dont need any configuration to send data to the device.p  hr  pemEditemp  pIt must also be noted that the cable Im using is microUSB to microUSB and it only works in one way, that is my device is powered by my phone only when the plug A connected to phone and plug B connected to device, not the other way around... it seems very strange. The fact that Im able to send data and not receive when plugged the emright wayem remains.p  hr  pemEDIT 2emp  pI found that a hrefhttpwww.basic4ppc.comandroidforumthreadsusbtoarduinoonlyworkinginonedirection.28569 relnofollowsomebody else had the same problema but it seems he wasnt able to solve it.p  hr  pemEDIT 3emp  pI finally found the solution on a hrefhttpwww.fourwalledcubicle.comfilesLUFADoc120730htmlgroupgroupusbclasscdcdevice.html relnofollowthis pageap  blockquote   pAnother major oversight is that there is no mechanism for the host to notify the device that there is a data sink on the host side ready to accept data. This means that the device may try to send data while the host isnt listening, causing lengthy blocking timeouts in the transmission routines. It is thus highly recommended that the virtual serial line DTR Data Terminal Ready signal be used where possible to determine if a host application is ready for data.p blockquote  pSo the DTR signal was mandatory and all I had to do was to add this to the interface configurationp  precodeconnection.controlTransfer0x21, 0x22, 0x1, 0, null, 0, 0 codepre  hr  pemEDIT 4emp  pIf anybody is interested I finished the project and its a hrefhttpsgithub.comNurgakSmartphonesensordatacollectionapplication relnofollowopen source and published on my GitHub accounta.
