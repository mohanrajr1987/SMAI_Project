Positive 8822 pIs there any way to do the equivalent of addcustomcommand run an external script when a certain file changes, but for something that should be run during CMake script execution itself That is, for dependency graph generation.p  pWe have our source code files split up into multiple sublibraries, and there are configuration files which list which source file goes with which library. The format of these configuration files are fixed by another tool we use. Currently, we run a custom external script which parses those configuration files and writes new files, which are then loaded by the CMake build process to give the list of filenames to be passed to addlibrary. This means that each time a source file is addedremoved, we need to remember to rerun the prebuild command, before rerunning CMake, and then relaunching the build command.p  pI know that CMake can recognize that it needs to rerun itself, so Im hoping that we can get CMake to 1 recognize that the configuration files are changed 2 rerun the configfile parser 3 load the new file list 4 use the new file list to regenerate the dependency tree 5 finally launch the actual buildcompilation process with the new files included. ... and all this from the standard build command, without having to manually run the external configfile parser or manually rerun the CMake command, and without needless execution when the configfile hasnt changed.p  pIn searching, I did find a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25482822adddependencytothecmakegeneratedbuildsystemitselfthis questiona, where using configurefile is suggested, but that doesnt address how to invoke the external configfile parser script. p
