Positive 4520 pI have a project that uses Prism 5 and thus Unity 3.5 and Enterprise Library 6. I have a WiX 3.9 installer project that deploys my product. Currently, I deploy the Prism 5 and Enterprise Library dlls into my program files installation folder. One of the 3rd party plugins that we use is still using Enterprise Library 5. This is causing an exception on startup where the plugin gets loaded with Enterprise Library 6 because it cannot find version 5. I dont have access to the 3rd party code to update it to Enterprise Library 6.p  pWhat are the best practices for deploying an application that uses Prism and Enterprise Library Should I be installing those files into the GAC Is there a wix bootstrapper package that I should be using Could I install both versions into the GAC and my program will use Enterprise Library 6 and the plugin would use version 5p

Positive 4520 pIve written a windows service that uses Mailgun to send out notifications, and Twilio for sending out txt messages, and Dapper for lightweight ORM duties. The Window Service works perfectly locally on Window 7 dev machine, but fails to run when I install it on Window Server. p  pTo install the service on the server I created a simple installer using WIX. This worked fine for my initial tests of the service, which only had it running a timer and writing a log file every 15 seconds.  Once I added additional functionality such as sending emails, reading a value from the database with Dapper, it still runs fine locally, including sending emails via Mailgun. When I try to install it on the server however it fails when it attempts to add the RestSharp.dll, Dapper.dll and Twilio.dll.p  pHere is the resulting Event Log when I run my updated Installer with the dll references added to the Wix Installer projectp  pService cannot be started.
