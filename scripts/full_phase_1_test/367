Negative 367 pI was wondering what exactly is stored in a .o or a .so file that results from compiling a C program.  a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6264249howdoesthecompilationlinkingprocessworkThis posta gives a quite good overview of the compilation process and the function of a .o file in it, and as far as I understand from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9809213whatareaandsofilesthis posta, .a and .so files are just multiple .o files merged into a single file that is linked in a static .a or dynamic .so way.p  pBut I wanted to check if I understand correctly what is stored in such a file.
