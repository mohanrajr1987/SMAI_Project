Because JavaScript is mostly a client side language, and encrypting anything client side isnt secure, maybe something like HMAC for Javascript isnt available  When I do a web search on codehmac in javascriptcode the first thing I get is codecryptojscode.  But it looks like I need to link to some services in codeltscriptgtcode tagsp  precodeltscript srchttpcryptojs.googlecode.comsvntags3.1.2buildrollupshmacmd5.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srchttpcryptojs.googlecode.comsvntags3.1.2buildrollupshmacsha1.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srchttpcryptojs.googlecode.comsvntags3.1.2buildrollupshmacsha256.jsgtltscriptgt ltscript srchttpcryptojs.googlecode.comsvntags3.1.2buildrollupshmacsha512.jsgtltscriptgt ltscriptgt     var hash  CryptoJS.HmacMD5Message, Secret Passphrase     var hash  CryptoJS.HmacSHA1Message, Secret Passphrase     var hash  CryptoJS.HmacSHA256Message, Secret Passphrase     var hash  CryptoJS.HmacSHA512Message, Secret Passphrase ltscriptgt codepre  pThe codeSecret Passphrasecode would be in your client side HTML.

Ill probably keep working on it, in the meantime.  Even though its Javascript, its a Google code.gscode Apps Script code file, which runs on the server.p

Negative 27080 pI have a few divs I am vertically aligning with codedisplay tablecode and codedisplay tablecellcode for the inners. Anyways, the problem is, when I animate the opacity with jQuery either through codefadeTocode or codefadeIncode, it always adds the codedisplay blockcode inlining. How can I keep the display type from changing during and after the opacity animationp
