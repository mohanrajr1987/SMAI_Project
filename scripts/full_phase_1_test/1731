Positive 1731 pToday, I have found I cannot run bash scripts properly on my Windows 7 machine under Cygwin. It is not the first time that I am trying to run shell scripts on Windows.

Negative 1731 pIm having a problem with a MySQL UDF function a hrefhttpmychem.sourceforge.net relnofollowmychem.sourceforge.neta thats dependent on a large library openbabel.org which is in turn plugin based. The problem is that the format plugins to openbabel doesnt seem to load in MySQL 5.1 and I suspect it might be due to the plugindir setting. I have set plugindir to usrlib which is the location for both libmychem.so and libopenbabel.so as well as the directory openbabel that contains the format plugins. Is there a way to turn off the plugindir restriction in MySQL preferably without compiling MySQL from sources so that I can test this hypothesis or do you have a different idea on what might cause the problem All this is done on Ubuntu 10.04 but I had the same kind of problems on 8.04, where I managed to get it working after a lot of steps that I unfortunately have forgotten...p  pI have turned off apparmor during testing and it doesnt help either.p
Negative 1731 pIf I have an object codeacode that either a builtin array or a classtype with a suitable codeoperator []code, and its returned type can be indexed itself, how should I write a generic function that can index all of them with a variadic call instead of separated bracket block  In other words, I can make expressions likep  precodea[i0][i1]...[iK] codepre  pand I want to be able to write it as a single functionp  precodeslice a, i0, i1, ..., iK  codepre  psince the rules of C require codeoperator []code to work on single arguments, making it lesscompatible with variadic stuff.  This question is based on a Usenet thread where I tried asking something similar ending up solving only possiblynested builtin arrays myself.p  pA first stabp  precodetemplate lt typename T, typename U gt constexpr auto slice T ampampt, U ampampu  noexcept gt   return ceforwardltTgtt[ ceforwardltUgtu ]   template lt typename T, typename U, typename V, typename ...W gt constexpr auto slice T ampampt, U ampampu, V ampampv, W... ampampw  noexcept gt       return slice ceforwardltTgtt[ceforwardltUgtu], ceforwardltVgtv,      ceforwardltWgtw...   codepre  pThe codeceforwardcode function templates are a codeconstexprcodemarked codestdforwardcode.  Some things in the standard that could be marked codeconstexprcode arent.  Im trying to figure out the right stuff to put in the return type and exception specification spots.  Some cases and caveats I know of arep  ul liThe builtin codeoperator []code requires one operand to be a datapointer or decayed array reference and the other to be an enumeration or integer type.  The operands can be in either order.  I dont know if an operand could be replaced with a classtype with an unambiguous nonexplicit conversion to an appropriate type.li liA class type can define codeoperator []code as nonstatic member functions.  Any such function can only have one parameter besides codethiscode.li liThe builtin operator cant throw.  Unless operands could be based on an UDT conversion said conversion is the only possible throw point.  The undefined behavior caused by boundary errors is beyond our purview here.li liWhether the last indexing call returns a lvalue reference, rvalue reference, or value should be reflected in the return type of codeslicecode.li liIf the final call is byvalue, then codestdisnothrowmoveconstructibleltReturnTypegtvaluecode should be ORd to the exception specification.  Byreference returns are codenoexceptcode.li liIf the builtin operator involves an array, the returned reference for that step should be a rvalue reference if the array is one too.  This is kindof a defect because pointers, unlike arrays, lose their targets l vs. rvalue status, so the traditional return would always be a lvalue reference.li liFor classtype indexing operators, make sure the exceptionspec and returntype sections refer to the same overload if more than one that the function body uses.  Be wary for overloads that differ only in the qualification of codethiscode codeconstcodecodevolatilecodebothneither andor codeampcodecodeampampcodeneither.li ul
