Restoring a wrong synchronization context on a UI thread may seriously affect component developers like me. The goal of the bounty is to draw more attention to this problem and to reward MattSmith whose answer helped tracking it down.emp  pIm responsible for a .NET WinForms codeUserControlcodebased component exposed as ActiveX to stronga legacy unmanaged appstrong, via COM interop. The runtime requirement is .NET 4.0  Microsoft.Bcl.Async.p  pThe component gets instantiated and used on the apps main STA UI thread. Its implementation utilizes codeasyncawaitcode, so it expects that an instance of a serializing synchronization context has been installed on the current thread i. e.,codeWindowsFormsSynchronizationContextcode. p  pUsually, codeWindowsFormsSynchronizationContextcode gets set up by codeApplication.Runcode, which is where the message loop of a managed app runs. Naturally, strongthis is not the case for the unmanaged host appstrong, and I have no control over this. Of course, the host app still has its own classic Windows message loop, so it should not be a problem to serialize codeawaitcode continuation callbacks.p  pHowever, none of the solutions Ive come up with so far is perfect, or even works properly. Heres an artificial example, where codeTestcode method is invoked by the host appp  precodeTask testTask  public void Test      this.testTask  TestAsync   async Task TestAsync      Debug.Printthread before await 0, Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId      var ctx1  SynchronizationContext.Current     Debug.Printctx1 0, ctx1  null ctx1.GetType.Name null      if ctx1 is WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext         SynchronizationContext.SetSynchronizationContextnew WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext      var ctx2  SynchronizationContext.Current     Debug.Printctx2 0, ctx2.GetType.Name      await TaskEx.Delay1000      Debug.WriteLinethread after await 0, Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId      var ctx3  SynchronizationContext.Current     Debug.Printctx3 0, ctx3  null ctx3.GetType.Name null      Debug.Printctx3  ctx1 0, ctx3  ctx2 1, ctx3  ctx1, ctx3  ctx2  codepre  pDebug outputp  pre thread before await 1 ctx1 SynchronizationContext ctx2 WindowsFormsSynchronizationContext thread after await 1 ctx3 SynchronizationContext ctx3  ctx1 True, ctx3  ctx2 False pre  pAlthough it continues on the same thread, the codeWindowsFormsSynchronizationContextcode context Im installing on the current thread before codeawaitcode stronggets reset to the default codeSynchronizationContextcodestrong after it, for some reason.p  pstrongWhy does it get resetstrong Ive verified my component is the only .NET component being used by that app. The app itself does call codeCoInitializeOleInitializecode properly.p  pIve also tried strongsetting up codeWindowsFormsSynchronizationContextcode in the constructor of a static singleton objectstrong, so it gets installed on the thread when my managed assembly gets loaded. That didnt help when codeTestcode is later invoked on the same thread, the context has been already reset to the default one.p  pIm considering using a a hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combpfxteamarchive2011011310115642.aspx relnofollowcustom awaitera to schedule codeawaitcode callbacks via codecontrol.BeginInvokecode of my control, so the above would look like codeawait TaskEx.Delay.WithContextcontrolcode. That should work for my own codeawaitscode, as long as the host app keeps pumping messages, but not for codeawaitscode inside any of the 3rd party assemblies my assembly may be referencing. p  pIm still researching this. strongAny ideas on how to keep the correct thread affinity for codeawaitcode in this scenario would be appreciated.strong p
