Positive 3262 pI am working on openmeeting integration for a Drupal site.

Positive 3262 pIs there a way make Drupal render pages as an anonymous visitor would see them, but for an authenticated user This is for the purpose of fully rendering unpublished and revision nodes, and omitting all of the typical drupal edit controls.p  pWe have heavily customized contenttypes and templates. For example, some content pages have a bunch of other contenttype nodes laid out in a grid sidebars etc. p  pWhen a user is authenticated and using https, nodespages are rendered with vieweditetc tabs and various controls for field widgets. In many cases this prevents rendering of the page in its final, polished form  slideshows are shown with their individual image edit tools, block views are shown with just their titles and not laid out as their template defines, etc. p  pUsers could switch to http in order to see the page as a visitor would as they can with published nodes, but since the page is unpublished they get Access denied. Something like Workflow requires the nodes be published, but still results in templates not processed and visible edit controls. Ive used Workflow in past, but the contenttypes were simple, and it was fine to have nodes rendered without templates, and to have the tabs and widget controls present.p  pCurrently Im forced to have users build pages on an alternate server where they must publish the nodes so that they can view them in http mode, and they get to see the pages properly rendered without all of the added edit controls. But its much too cumbersome to move nodes into production, as I havent found a robust migration system Ive investigated a LOT  we also use Organic Groups, and when new groups with many pages are added, we wind up needing edit the group ID, etc. Even if we decide to only allow editing on a staging server and then sync DBfiles up to the production server, I might then still have the same problem on the staging server.p  pMy goal is to allow users to create unpublished content and revisions, and to be able to preview the nodes exactly as an anonymous visitor would, without any of the edit controls, and with complete rendering via field templates. Is that possiblep
