Positive 1931 pIve written some unit tests to measure the time it takes for my app to create and load view controllers using a codemeasurecode block.

Positive 1931 pRecenty I was implementing a unit test using JOOQ MockDataProvider.  When I wanted to use my mock provider in DAO with many selects I had to use many ifelse statements. p  pAccording to a hrefhttpwww.jooq.orgdoclatestmanualtoolsjdbcmocking relnofollowhttpwww.jooq.orgdoclatestmanualtoolsjdbcmockinga, I just need to check if my SQL starts with some query. And my SQLs used in DAO could start with 3 different ways, so I used pretty complex ifelse construct. p  pSecond thing  I wanted my MockDataProvider to return some mock result only when SQL is executed for the first time, and then not to return any results  in DAO iterated in loop 5 times, and each time my DAO should check something in database. I had no idea how to mock such behaviour, so I used simple counter  but it looks awful, and I want it to be implemented in a good way.
