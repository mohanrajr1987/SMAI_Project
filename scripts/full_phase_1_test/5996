Positive 5996 pIm not sure if im understanding vagrant correctly but to my understanding its like a server running in a VM on your computer, which you use instead of your localhost to check to see if stuff is working because your local setup is slightly different to your servers. However is the quickest way to check updates, to git push from your local pc, then git pull on your vagrant VM then load up the website on your local pc to see changes, seems like it would become a painful process after a while compared to the local hosts CTRLS f5 localhost website.p

Negative 5996 pLooking for suggestions on how to approach this problem and to understand if Domain Driven Design is really the best pattern here.p  pMy client is in the process of rearchitecting its nearobsolete stack of tools and services.  Client is a rapidly expanding emerchant.  Its core product is its large ecommerce website.  Around this website, the client has a variety of data feeds that it exposes to its partners.  A slew of internal applications to help in marketing, sales, reporting, etc.  A slew of user support and partner support applications.  A good amount of various datasyncs, ETL jobs, etc...  You get the picture.  p  pData stores and data providers are also plentiful.  NOSQL cloudbased megascalable storage provides most of the stuff on the public website.  SQLservers with a number of databases provide data to internal applications.  There are also special searchonly servers to provide megascalable searching capabilities, as well as other feeds that apps consume from various 3rd party vendors.  If DDD is adopted, the plan would be to have various groups of repository objects inherit from data storespecific repository base classesp  pThere has been an exercise performed by the client where they have mapped out most of their business entities on a generic level entity names and relationships.  Outside of that generic level, there is a decent amount of reuse of various concrete objects across applications as well as there is a decent amount of entities that would differ in their implementation, depending on an app.p  pFor example Order entity on an ecommerce website may look like X, while for an app that handles support calls like Y, and furthermore for someone doing fraud analysis like Z.p  pIm looking for suggestions on how to adapt DDD or another architectural pattern to handle this giant mess have a solid enterprise strategy that facilitates reuse and allows for separation of logic if necessary.  On top of the usual scalable, flexible, adaptable, unittestable, simple, etc criteria.p  pDue to different data stores, structure of DTOs looks significantly different from datastore to datastore.  Due to various business needs, various apps need different versions of certain entities, and since the company is rapidly expanding, the future is highly unstable and flexibility is paramount.p  pI guess my biggest problem is finding a way to separate the business model to different domains and still keep it together when there is high amount of sharing or reuse, while being able to adopt to high level of change.p  pThank you for all your suggestionsp  pP.S.
