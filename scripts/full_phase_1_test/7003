What Im trying to do is the following I have a header that fits the window size 100 through css. the height changes through jquery but I dont think thats relevant for this question. In this header I have an image which I want the middle of it in the middle of the screen. Like this  Im not allowed to put images on this forum p  precode ltimagegt                                                REST                           REST            IMAGE  IMAGE IMAGE  IMAGE                                                                  ltscreengt  REST  not visible outside the screen codepre  pSo if the screen would be bigger it would show more of the image, but it would still be perfectly aligned in the middle. So far everything i have done went well.p  pMade the following codep  precode ltdiv idheadergt     ltdiv idheaderbggtltimg srcpicsheaderbg.jpg idstretchgtltdivgt     ltdiv idlogogt             ltdiv classlogogtltimg srcpicslogo.png width401 height174gtltdivgt     ltdivgt  ltdivgt  codepre  pand the jquerycodep  precodeif  stretch.width gt window.width                screen  window.width             pic  stretch.width             rest  pic  screen             margin  rest 2             margin  margin  margin  margin              stretch.cssmarginleftmarginpx          codepre  pAs you can see this works fine BUT, when I load the page for the very first time it hides too much of the image so that I get and empty space on the right side.p  pDoes anyone know what Im doing wrongp
Negative 7003 pIve been using the module pattern for a while, but recently have started wanting to mix in functions and properties into them to increase code reuse.  Ive read some good resources on the subject, but still am a bit uncertain as to the best approach.  Here is a modulep  precodevar myModule  function       var privateConfigVar  Private      constructor     function module       module.publicMethod  function           console.logpublic           function privateMethod1          console.logprivate           return module  codepre  pAnd here is a mixin objectp  precodevar myMixin  function   Mixin.prototype       mixinMethod1 function           console.logmixin private 1     ,     mixinMethod2 function           console.logmixin private 2       codepre  pIdeally, Id like to mixin some methods from other objects as private methods and some as public methods, so that I could call some extend function, with a param as privatepublic.  So, thatp  precodemixinmyModule, myMixin, private codepre  pmakes the myMixin methods available within myModule by just calling mixinMethod1 and have correct scope, andp  precodemixinmyModule, myMixin, public codepre  pmakes the myMixin methods available within myModule by calling module.mixinMethod1 and have correct scopep  pIve tried using a method that copies properties from one prototype to another, Ive tried the underscore extend method to copy properties of the object from one to to the other, and various things in between.  I think Im a bit turned around regarding scope and prototypes at this point, and would love some direction as to how best to do mixins like this when using the module pattern.  Note that it doesnt matter what the object myMixin looks like whether adding functions to the prototype, or a module itself, Im just trying to figure out some way to make it work.p  pThankp
