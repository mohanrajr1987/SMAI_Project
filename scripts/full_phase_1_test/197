Positive 197 pIm new to Python in that I learned it through a CodeAcademy course and could use some help with figuring this out.p  pI have a file, TestingDeleteLines.txt, thats about 300 lines of text.

My current thinking was that I could write the lines to a list, then reopen the file, match the list to the text file, and if it finds a match, delete the lines. p  pMy current problem is twofoldp  ol liIts duplicating the random elements. If it picks a line, I need it to not pick that same line again.
