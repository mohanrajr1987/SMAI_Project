Positive 2678 pI have a program that solves generally for 1D brownian motion using an Eulers Method. Being a stochastic process, I want to average it over many particles.

Positive 2678 pIm using view controller containment to implement something similar to a tab bar controller. There are three buttons each showing a different view. Always one view is shown at the time.p  pNow I want to test the memory management. I switch between different tabs and then the container gets popped off the navigation stack. Afterwards I press the emSimulate Memory Warningem button.p  pIn the case of automatic releasing nothing changed by me, not calling codeDisposecode, ... all view controllers even the container are released except the child view controller which was the last shown in the container. If I press emSimulate Memory Warningem again, then the missing child view controller is released also. Is this the desired behaviorp  pIf I do manually releasing calling codeDisposecode I often gets the same child view controller released twice codeDisposecode called two times. The only solution to not release twice is to save which child view controller is shown and only release that in the codeDisposecode of the container.p  pThis is how I add my child view controllerp  precodeAddChildViewController childViewController View.AddSubview childViewController.View childViewController.DidMoveToParentViewController this codepre  pHere I remove the child view controller from the containerp  precodeviewController.WillMoveToParentViewController null viewController.View.RemoveFromSuperview  viewController.RemoveFromParentViewController  viewController.DidMoveToParentViewController null codepre  pThe switching between the tabs is done by the above magic except that I have multiple variables which store a reference to the child view controllers. The reason is to not always create the child view controller again if the user switches between them.p  pThere shouldnt be any strong reference cycle no event handler, .... How do I get my child view controller correctly releasedp

Positive 2678 pI have a C application where I sometimes require a large buffer of POD types e.g. an array of 25 strongbstrongillion codefloatcodes to be held in memory at once in a contiguous block. This particular memory organization is driven by the fact that the application makes use of some C APIs that operate on the data. Therefore, a different arrangement such as a list of smaller chunks of memory like codestddequecode uses isnt feasible.p  pThe application has an algorithm that is run on the array in a streaming fashion think something like thisp  precodestdvectorltfloatgt bufltverylargesizegt for sizet i  0 i lt buf.size i doalgorithmbuf[i] codepre  pThis particular algorithm is the conclusion of a pipeline of earlier processing steps that have been applied to the dataset. Therefore, once my algorithm has passed over the codeicodeth element in the array, the application no longer needs it. p  pIn theory, therefore, I could free that memory in order to reduce my applications memory footprint as it chews through the data. However, doing something akin to a coderealloccode or a codestdvectorltTgtshrinktofitcode would be inefficient because my application would have to spend its time copying the unconsumed data to the new spot at reallocation time.p  pMy application runs on POSIXcompliant operating systems e.g. Linux, OS X. Is there any interface by which I could ask the operating system to free only a specified region from the front of the block of memory This would seem to be the most efficient approach, as I could just notify the memory manager that, for example, the first 2 GB of the memory block can be reclaimed once Im done with it.p

It is written in C and running on Windows 7.p  pstrongYesstrong, I have read existing questions about this in Stack Overflow as well as other places on the internet.  If fact, I found a great article by Eric Lippert called Out Of Memory Does Not Refer to Physical Memory, where he provides a very clear explanation of this condition.p  pema hrefhttpblogs.msdn.combericlippertarchive20090608outofmemorydoesnotrefertophysicalmemory.aspxPageIndex1comments relnofollowhttpblogs.msdn.combericlippertarchive20090608outofmemorydoesnotrefertophysicalmemory.aspxPageIndex1commentsaemp  pIn this article he refers to out of memory with the statement emWhich is a misnomer, these days.

Rather, an out of memory error happens because the process is unable to find a large enough section of contiguous unused pages in its virtual address space to do the requested mapping.p blockquote  pWhen I look at the service within PerfMon, I see columns under Memory for Commit, Working Set, and Private all of which are continually growing.  Im sure there is some string that is continually being added to or some list that is not being cleared out.p  pstrongMy question is this, Is there some technology in C that I can use to monitor memory requests for individual objects or collections from within the code itself such as a library of classes that could monitor the systemstrong  If so, I could keep a watch on contiguous memory requests from within the code itself.p
