Positive 3995 pI am currently trying to resolve a problem for a new feature on my chrome extension. The way it works is that it will grab your currently viewed tab. Take the first seen ISBN and then parse it into the below code and function.p  pI want to adjust this now in such a way that if the isbn returns req.status 200 that I create a new req.open with a second ISBN that is found on the site.p  pI have tried this in various ways, however the functions have always failed. check for req.status before the function, do a nested function for trial and error with a second isbn. The important piece of the current code looks as follows. Any help would be appreciated. Let me know if there is anything I should clarify more.
