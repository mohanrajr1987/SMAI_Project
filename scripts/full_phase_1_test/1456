Positive 1456 pIve been working on symmetric encryption, but suddenly.. wild error appeared. I cant convert back string from bytes. Ive used similar approaches on data manipulation with bytes many times before, but this time Im stuck. First ofc I used strongEncoding.UTF8.GetBytesstrong and strongEncoding.UTF8.GetStringstrong byte after mysterious error, thought maybe this is something culture based inside .net framework. So i copied good old code for stringbyte[] conversion just to check whats wrong. And it seem nothing should be wrong, but its simply not working.p  pOfc first impression is that it is somehow related to symmetric encryption, but I double check bytes which comes in and out from them, and they are equal..p  padditional info Im currently working on .net 4 client profilep  pAny ideasp  precodepublic class Test      public static byte[] GetBytesFromStringstring str              var bytes  new byte[str.Length  sizeofchar]         System.Buffer.BlockCopystr.ToCharArray, 0, bytes, 0, bytes.Length         return bytes           public static string GetStringFromBytesbyte[] bytes              var chars  new char[bytes.Length  sizeofchar]         System.Buffer.BlockCopybytes, 0, chars, 0, bytes.Length         return new stringchars           public static bool ArraysAreEqualltTgtT[] array0, T[] array1              if array0.Length  array1.Length return false         return array0.Wheret, i gt t.Equalsarray1[i].Any           public static void Run              var aes  new System.Security.Cryptography.AesCryptoServiceProvider         byte[] key  aes.Key         byte[] iv  aes.IV          string text  hello World  initial text          byte[] plainBytes  GetBytesFromStringtext        get some bytes         string plainText  GetStringFromBytesplainBytes   reverse bytes back         if string.Comparetext, plainText, StringComparison.InvariantCulture  0     check strings             throw new NotSupportedException         System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLineplainText       all good           up to this point I assume GetBytesFromStringltgtGetStringFromBytes methods works fine          byte[] encrytpedBytes  AES.AesEncryptplainBytes, key, iv        implementation of encryption         byte[] decryptedBytes  AES.AesDecryptencrytpedBytes, key, iv    implementation of decryption          if ArraysAreEqualencrytpedBytes, decryptedBytes  check arrays             throw new NotSupportedException          I even print them to check manually.. by my eyes..

Negative 1456 pI have written an Android app which runs on a custom kernel on Android 4.4 Kitkat device, which uses the Android Serial Port API a hrefhttpscode.google.compandroidserialportapi relnofollowhttpscode.google.compandroidserialportapia in order to open the serial port devttyACM0 which is the port associated with my serial device. The port has the proper 666 permissions crwrwrw, and the app itself even has the  WRITEEXTERNALSTORAGE permission. p  pHowever, even though the permissions appear correct, when my app tries to open said serial port using the library, it fails. In my java code, if I try to do a device.canWrite it returns false, whereas a device.canRead returns true. I feel like this is a symptom of a greater permissions problem.p  pIf I use the sample apk bundled with the serial port apilibrary, I get the same issue, where the app fails at the device.canWrite and throws a SecurityException.p  pThe exact same code DOES successfully run and open when ran on a custom kernel ICS device, for which the app was originally developed for. However, the kernels for both  were written by the same developer, and at least on a surface glance, the permissions on the port seem to be the same. p  pIs it likely this is an issue that I can resolve on the application code side I have tried some other serial port libraries USBSerial3.0, usbserialforandroidmaster and I seem to encounter the same issue. p  pRegardless of where the issue may lie, would anyone have any ideas of what the problem may be Making changes to the kernel, app, and api are all on the table. Thank you.p
Negative 1456 pI know I can use maven to pull the javadocs for an artifact if theyve been added, which should come through as a JAR right, which I can then unpack and browse.  My problem is, Im trying to figure out which of a series of artifacts have the particular package Im hunting for.  I emcouldem download a halfdozen javadoc packages, unpack all of them, then open the index files one at a time, but that sounds like it would be pretty unpleasant.p  pThere must be a better way  I noticed that Nexus supports javadoc artifact browsing, but apparently only in the Pro version which we do not have, and are unlikely to get any time soon.  Id prefer a GUI solution, though Id settle for a command line answer, provided its something along the lines of codeshowmethedocs groupIdartifactId [version]code.p  pETA To clarify Im looking specifically to compare multiple versions of an artifact, or multiple different but similar artifacts foocore versus fooutils versus fooextra or something when Im not sure what artifact actually contains the package  class I need.  Maybe theres a better way to do that, and I asked the wrong question  If I add each artifact as a Maven dependency and check the docs in Eclipse, that can work, but if theres 20 old versions of an artifact, and exactly one of them has the method Im looking for, it could take a while.p

Negative 1456 pI have this kind of problem, I have iframes with videos embedded into my pages of the website. Note, that iframes urls are from stronganother domainstrong. From time to time these urls can be broken, or stop working and instead of the video there is a message This video has been removed from public access. . Is there any way that I can delete those failed iframes from the pages by jquery or just javascript.p  pI was thinking I could be able to search for text inside iframes similar tp  precodeiframe.eachfunction      var val  this.iscontainsvideo has been     console.logval  returns false  codepre  pand then remove those, but it returns false, afa I understood from the a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSameoriginpolicy relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSameoriginpolicya.p  pAlso, if it matters, I found out that the differencewithout having the above text between working and broken iframe, is that the last one does not contain codeobjectcode node.p  pIs there any method to handle this problem p  pThanksp
