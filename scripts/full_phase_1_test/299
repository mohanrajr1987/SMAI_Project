Positive 299 pIm building a mixed interaction AS3AIR application. Some of my scenes use the regular CPU rendered display classes flash.display.Sprite, flash.display.MovieClip and another highdensity graphics mode uses Starling. I can switch between and use these happily, and I can switch between windowed mode at 720p to fullscreen mode just fine.p  pHowever, I just added a StageWebView to easily add some HTML based content, and Im having trouble with resize. If I dont call new Starling then the StageWebView instance will correctly resize to maintain the same relative screen dimensions when I switch from windowed to FullScreen. However, as soon as I create a Starling instance, the StageWebView will not correctly resize on fullscreen it retains the absolute dimensions originally specified. If I dont instantiate Starling, the StageWebView resizes perfectly.p  pDo I need an event handler for Event.RESIZE to specifically adjust the viewPort member of the StageWebView object How do I get the correct relative dimensions from the original fixed windowed size I tried looking at stage widthheight and the numbers were oddly large, with AIR failing to build a new Rectangle correctly.p  pI would appreciate any sample code for anyone who has solved this problem. Thanks.p
