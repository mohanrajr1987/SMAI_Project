Negative 16157 pI am trying to develop a simple app using Google maps. While running the app i can see only the grid and the map controls. I did obtain an API key and included it into main.xml file. The permissions for the internet was also granted in the androidmanifest.xml. My browser in avd is connecting to internet and when i run the native map app in the avd, it shows the following error.p  pstrongNetwork Failurestrong  ...  strongWrong remote strings version.GMM Server must be hostingstringsremote533149424.datememstrongp  h2GoogleMapActivity.javah2  precodepackage com.example.googlemap import android.os.Bundle import com.google.android.maps.MapActivity import com.google.android.maps.MapView  public class GoogleMapActivity extends MapActivity   Override  public void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState     super.onCreatesavedInstanceState   setContentViewR.layout.main   MapView mapView  MapView findViewByIdR.id.mapview  mapView.setBuiltInZoomControlstrue      Override  protected boolean isRouteDisplayed    return false    codepre  h2main.xmlh2  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltcom.google.android.maps.MapView     xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid     androidididmapview     androidlayoutwidthfillparent     androidlayoutheightfillparent     androidclickabletrue     androidapiKey0kuSQz9hsxalJpKGJbFpzLqhl5d4gG3ohDg gt codepre  h2manifest.xmlh2  precodeltxml version1.0 encodingutf8gt ltmanifest xmlnsandroidhttpschemas.android.comapkresandroid       packagecom.example.googlemap       androidversionCode1       androidversionName1.0gt     ltusessdk androidminSdkVersion10 gt      ltapplication androidicondrawableicon androidlabelstringappnamegt    ltactivity androidname.GoogleMapActivity    androidlabelstringappname   androidthemeandroidstyleTheme.NoTitleBargt       ltintentfiltergt       ltaction androidnameandroid.intent.action.MAIN gt        ltcategory androidnameandroid.intent.category.LAUNCHER gt        ltintentfiltergt      ltactivitygt      ltuseslibrary androidnamecom.google.android.maps gt      ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.INTERNET gt       ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.ACCESSFINELOCATIONgt      ltapplicationgt        ltmanifestgt codepre  pIm using a proxy to connect to the internet.
