Positive 38948 pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pI need to draw a circle onto a codeMKMapViewcode, something where I can get the radius of the circle and its center coordinate. However, I would also like the circle to be a subview of the codeMKMapViewcode, so that the map view can scroll underneath the circle, updating its center coordinate as the map moves and updating its radius as the map is zoomed in and out.p  pDoes anyone know how I might be able to accomplish thisp  hr  pemThis is the original wording of the questionemp  pIve drawn a circle onto a codeMKMapViewcode using the code belowp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      self.locationManager  [[CLLocationManager alloc] init]     self.locationManager.delegate  self      self.region  [MKCircle circleWithCenterCoordinateself.locationManager.location.coordinate radiuskViewRegionDefaultDistance]     [self.mapView addOverlayself.region]    MKOverlayPathRenderer mapViewMKMapView map viewForOverlayid ltMKOverlaygtoverlay      MKCircleRenderer region  [[MKCircleRenderer alloc] initWithOverlayoverlay]     region.strokeColor  [UIColor blueColor]     region.fillColor  [[UIColor blueColor] colorWithAlphaComponent0.4]     return region  codepre  pThis works and produces a circle on the map view. However, when I scroll the map view, the circle moves with it. strongI would like the circle to remain stationary and have the map view scroll underneath the circle.strongp  pIs is important to note that I will need to get the center coordinate and radius of the circle in order to create a emregionem. For that reason, I cannot simply draw a UIView on top of the MKMapView, as I would have no way to get the radius in meters of the UIView.p
Positive 38948 pIm having a hard time getting an codeMKMapViewcode subclass to workp  pThe subclass provides a clustering functionality. Because annotations are being moved to a cluster with a nice animation, the annotations provided to the map must have a setter for codecoordinatecode. Hence, Ive created a subprotocol of codeMKAnnotationcodep  precodeprotocol MyAnnotationProtocol MKAnnotation      var coordinate CLLocationCoordinate2D  get set   codepre  pSo internally the subclass of codeMKMapViewcode works with objects conforming to codeMyAnnotationProtocolcode.p  pThe clustering algorithm itself is outsourced to another class. For the sake of reusability, the algorithm itself works with codeMKAnnotationcode objects  no need to provide codeMyAnnotationProtocolcode objects.p  pThe concrete class Im providing as annotations to the map looks like thisp  precodeclass MXPointAnnotation NSObject, MyAnnotationProtocol      var coordinate CLLocationCoordinate2D      override init          coordinate  CLLocationCoordinate2Dlatitude 0, longitude 0       codepre  pWhen running, the app crashes at this line inside the cluster algorithm classp  precodelet seeds  regionQueryForAnnotationannotation as MKAnnotation, inMapView mapView codepre  pcodeannotationcode is stored in an codeNSSetcode   therefore it has to be cast before it can be used.p  pThe log saysp  precodeCould not cast value of type NSKVONotifying.MXPointAnnotation 0x13402cf40 to MKAnnotation 0x1a1d89ec8. codepre  p is my apps name.p  pThis seems like a bug to me, because clearly codeMXPointAnnotationcode conforms to codeMyAnnotationProtocolcode and therefore to codeMKAnnotationcodep  pWhat really drives me crazy is the fact that when Im changing the interface of codeMXPointAnnotationcode top  precodeclass MXPointAnnotation NSObject, MKAnnotation, MyAnnotationProtocol  ....  codepre  pthe app does NOT crash and everything works as expected.brbr Note that the protocol conformance is redundant for codeMKAnnotationcode, because codeMyAnnotationProtocolcode already conforms to that.brbrIs this a current Swift bug or am I doing something wrong herep

Negative 38948 pIn the course of evaluating .net IoC frameworks, I gave spring.net a try first, seeing as how much I liked spring in java.  However, Im rapidly getting the feeling that it is a stalestalleddead project.  The forums have almost no activity the documentation, though verbose, is infuriating with its selfreferencing, poor examples, and incomplete sections spring.net questions dont seem to get much traction on stackoverflow and googling for spring.net issues usually leads to pages documenting somewhat obscure scenarios.  Im close to making the jump to Ninja or Castle, but I can see that their documentation doesnt exactly sparkle either.  Still, if everyone has poor documentation, Id rather pick an active project.
