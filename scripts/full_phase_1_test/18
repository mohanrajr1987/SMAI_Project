Positive 18 pIve got a problem thats been driving me kind of nuts. I have to write a function that takes two strings, stringA and stringB, and using stringA remove all instances of stringA from stringB. The resulting string C should have no instances of A in it and zero white space.p  pTest cases would be  p  precodestringA  ab   stringB  aabb stringC    codepre  por p  precodestringA     stringB     stringC  stringB   codepre  pSo far my general approach has been to start with two prompts stored in variables that collect the strings. .replace is run on both in order to remove any white space.  p  pThe closest Ive gotten was two for loops, one for stringA with string B nested inside, and testing the indices against eachother for matches. If its not a match, pushing it to stringC. But my problem is, its not really removing the instances of stringA only if the two indices in question happen to match at that time.  p  pIve searched around here quite a bit and came up with .filter or .replace but Im not having any luckinsight on how exactly to use those. Any advice would be super helpful, I feel like Ive hit a wall. a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.net0zzddew8 relnofollowHeres a link to my code in jsfiddlea  p  pThanks, everyone.  p  pstrongUPDATEstrong  p  pYou guys are amazing.
