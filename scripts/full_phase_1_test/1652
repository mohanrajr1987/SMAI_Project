Positive 1652 pIm working on a WPF app with MVVM pattern using the Galasoft MVVMLight library. My app loads data from remote API server by parsing JSON data to DataModels using the RestSharp library and the Newtosnoft Json.NET. I need to allow users to modify data from APP all CRUD operations directly from app, but my app needs to be responsive also in offline mode and also in environments with slow internet connection. p  pNow I have it implemented using my DataController class which is registered to different messages generated by my ViewModels for messaging Im using the MVVMLight Messenger. So after user for example changes entity A, I send a RequestToUpdate message, DataController handles it and 1 Update the DataModel assigned with entity A,  2 Sends message UpdateComplete so all ViewModels which have this Entity A handles this message and updates ViewModels and Views assigned with this Entity A,  3 DataController tries to asynchronously update entity on the remote API every DataModel has a DateTime property  SyncedToServer, so if remote request fails  user is in offline mode, I set this property to null, otherwise I set it to time of completed sync.p  pAfter app is back online, it traverses over all DataModels and checks if they are SyncedToServer and if not, it tries to resync it.p  pIs there any better patternlibrary to implement my app to be responsive and reliable  in offline and badinternet environmentsp

Positive 1652 pIve tried several ways to synch the following scenario.  The last way I tried is to use an event to signal after FifoQueueData.  Thread 2 would then release from the event and send the data over the network.  The problem is that thread 1 loops around too fast and signals the event before Thread 2 waits on that same event.  This causes the event to wait until it times out.p  precodethread1    for1 .. 10      GenerateData     FifoQueueData      signal   thread2    whilenot signalled      WaitForQueuedData     FifoDequeueData     SendDataOverNetwork     codepre
Positive 1652 pI am having trouble finding some good research andor publications on techniques for synchronizing data between multiple devices.p  pMy example use case is I have an application which runs on multiple devicesarchitectures including a web service. What are some fundamental approaches that I can use to synchronize the data without overriding or otherwise corrupting data that may have not been synchronized in the correct order For this example, the data is all financial data and foreign keys to categories think accounting or budgeting software.p  pHeres an edge case where I am strugglingp  pUser has the Application installed on their Desktop, on their Phone, and they also have access to their data on the website. The desktop and phone are not guaranteed to always have an internet connection so they need a local copy of the data that is both readable and modifiable.p  pThe User performs some actions on the Desktop application e.g. recategorizes some transactions. The user also performs some actions on the Phone application e.g. adds transactions. The Phone synchronizes with the Server before the Desktop does. However, the Desktop changes took place first. In some cases these records may have been modified by both the desktop and phone application and even the web site.p  pstrongOverall, how can I best cope with consistency across these devicesstrongp  pIm primarily looking for well documented, researched, or otherwise scientific methods for performing this synchronization across N devices with fairly unpredictable merges.p

Positive 1652 pHeres a minimal example of what Im trying to do.  Right now youll see, if you run this, that the example takes a little more than 10 seconds to complete.  It should take less than 2 seconds.  The problem is that there is a race condition.  The loop takes too long and the SetEvent occurs before the WaitForSingle object can get it.  What would be nice is if the event could trigger but the WaitForSingleObject could still know it triggered somehow. What happens here is that data is generated which could take a long time.  That data is then sent across the network which could take even longer.  So I want to queue data to be sent then be about my merry way while another thread picks up the data and sends it out.  That way I can queue infinitely until I have nothing left to do and then the thread joins to the sending thread until its finished sending out all the network data.p  precodeinclude ltstdio.hgt include ltwindows.hgt include ltunistd.hgt  define PIPENAME .pipetestpipe  void copyprotocolbufferstruct protocolbuffer in, struct protocolbuffer out DWORD PipeClientStartSendBufferThreadstruct clientpipesettings pipesettings, LPDWORD lpThreadId DWORD InitializeClientPipeSettingsstruct clientpipesettings pipesettings void initializeprotocolbufferstruct protocolbuffer protocolbuffer  struct protocolbuffer       sizet length     sizet location     int datatype     char data     struct protocolbuffer next   struct clientpipesettings      HANDLE hPipe     LPCTSTR name     DWORD pipetimeout     HANDLE writeevent     struct protocolbuffer fifo     HANDLE sendthread    DWORD WINAPI PipeClientSendThreadLPVOID clientpipesettingsobject       struct clientpipesettings pipesettings  struct clientpipesettings clientpipesettingsobject      struct protocolbuffer buf  NULL      while1          WaitForSingleObjectpipesettingsgtwriteevent, 10000          if buf  NULL              buf  pipesettingsgtfifo          else              struct protocolbuffer fifoprotocolbuffer  bufgtnext             freebuf             buf  fifoprotocolbuffer              ifbufgtlength  0                 signal to quit                 return 0                   Send data over the network         Sleep500           return 0   DWORD PipeQueueBufferstruct clientpipesettings pipesettings, struct protocolbuffer buf      struct protocolbuffer outprotocolbuffer  struct protocolbuffer mallocsizeof buf      ifoutprotocolbuffer  NULL         exit1      copyprotocolbufferbuf, outprotocolbuffer      if pipesettingsgtfifo  NULL          pipesettingsgtfifo  outprotocolbuffer          else              struct protocolbuffer lastprotocolbuffer  pipesettingsgtfifo         whilelastprotocolbuffergtnext  NULL                      lastprotocolbuffer  lastprotocolbuffergtnext                  lastprotocolbuffergtnext  outprotocolbuffer           ifSetEventpipesettingsgtwriteevent         return GetLastError      return ERRORSUCCESS     int mainvoid      struct clientpipesettings pipesettings     InitializeClientPipeSettingsamppipesettings      DWORD dwThreadId  0      PipeClientStartSendBufferThreadamppipesettings, ampdwThreadId      Generate data which could take a while     Sleep1000     struct protocolbuffer buf      initializeprotocolbufferampbuf      buf.length  5     buf.data  char malloc5     buf.data[0]  b     buf.data[1]  l     buf.data[2]  a     buf.data[3]  h     buf.data[4]  0      PipeQueueBufferamppipesettings, ampbuf      Sleep100     PipeQueueBufferamppipesettings, ampbuf      buf.length  0      PipeQueueBufferamppipesettings, ampbuf      WaitForSingleObjectpipesettings.sendthread, 100000    DWORD InitializeClientPipeSettingsstruct clientpipesettings pipesettings      pipesettingsgtwriteevent  CreateEventNULL, 0, 0, NULL     ifpipesettingsgtwriteevent  NULL         return GetLastError      pipesettingsgthPipe  INVALIDHANDLEVALUE     pipesettingsgtfifo  NULL      pipesettingsgtsendthread  NULL       return ERRORSUCCESS   DWORD PipeClientStartSendBufferThreadstruct clientpipesettings pipesettings, LPDWORD lpThreadId      HANDLE h  CreateThreadNULL, 0, PipeClientSendThread, pipesettings, 0, lpThreadId      ifh  NULL         return GetLastError      pipesettingsgtsendthread  h      return ERRORSUCCESS   void copyprotocolbufferstruct protocolbuffer in, struct protocolbuffer out      outgtdatatype  ingtdatatype     outgtlength  ingtlength     outgtlocation  ingtlocation     outgtnext  ingtnext      outgtdata  charmallocingtlength     if outgtdata  NULL          exit1           memcpyoutgtdata, ingtdata, ingtlength   void initializeprotocolbufferstruct protocolbuffer protocolbuffer      protocolbuffergtdata  NULL     protocolbuffergtlength  0     protocolbuffergtlocation  0     protocolbuffergtnext  NULL     protocolbuffergtdatatype  0  codepre
Negative 1652 pLong story short, I am trying to implement a naive solution for streaming video from the iOS cameramicrophone to a server. p  pI am using codeAVCaptureSessioncode with audio and video codeAVCaptureOutputscode, and then using codeAVAssetWritercodecodeAVAssetWriterInputcode to capture video and audio in the codecaptureOutputdidOutputSampleBufferfromConnectioncode method and write the resulting video to a file.p  pTo make this a stream, I am using an codeNSTimercode to break the video files into 1 second chunks by hotswapping in a different codeAVAssetWritercode that has a different codeoutputURLcode and upload these to a server over HTTP.p  pThis is working, but the issue Im running into is this the beginning of the code.mp4code files appear to always be missing audio in the first frame, so when the video files are concatenated on the server running codeffmpegcode there is a noticeable audio skip at the intersections of these files. The video is just fine  no skipping.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com97rM4.png altBlank audiop  pI tried many ways of making sure there were no codeCMSampleBufferscode dropped and checked their timestamps to make sure they were going to the right codeAVAssetWritercode, but to no avail.p  pChecking the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiossamplecodeAVCamIntroductionIntro.htmlapplerefdocuidDTS40010112 relnofollowAVCam examplea with codeAVCaptureMovieFileOutputcode and AVCaptureLocation example with codeAVAssetWritercode and it appears the files they generate do the same thing.p  pMaybe there is something fundamental I am misunderstanding here about the nature of audiovideo files, as Im new to videoaudio capture  but thought Id check before I tried to workaround this by learning to use codeffmpegcode as some seem to do to fragment the stream if you have any tips on this, too, let me know.

Negative 1652 pIm trying to implement an ObserverObservable pattern on an EC2 instance. I have been able to create the application using RMI relatively simply. However trying to get RMI and the Amazon cloud to work has been neer impossible for client callbacks.p  pRMI also limits the client applications to being Java based. Hence ive been messing around with JAXWS in order to use SOAP messages. However i havent been able to come up with a solid way to make callbacks on the client with it.p  pDoes anyone know of a way that i would be able to program in a similar way that RMI works with client callback methods to update Observers when something on my server has been changed, using hopefully a language independent distributed methodp  pI would be willing to make it so that all my clients must be written in java, but i need to be able to get it working on the EC2 instance which RMI seems incapable of doing callbacks even if i open all TCP ports and use a security manager.p  pThanks, Benp

Negative 1652 pIm writing realtime data to an empty spinning disk sequentially. emEDIT It doesnt have to be sequential, as long as I can read it back as if it was sequential.em The data arrives at a rate of 100 MBs and the disks have an average write speed of 120 MBs.p  pSometimes especially as free space starts to decrease the disk speed goes under 100 MBs depending on where on the platter the disk is writing, and I have to drop vital data.p  pIs there any way to write to disk in a pattern or some other way to ensure a constant write speed close to the average rate Regardless of how much data there currently is on the disk.p  pEDITp  pSome notes on why I think this should be possible.p  pWhen usually writing to the disk, it starts in the fast portion of the platter and then writes towards the slower parts. However, if I could write half the data to the fast part and half the data to the slow part i.e. for 1 second it could write 50MB to the fast part and 50MB to the slow part, they should meet in the middle. I could possibly achieve a constant ratep  pAs a programmer, I am not sure how I can decide where on the platter the data is written or even if the OS can achieve something similar.p
