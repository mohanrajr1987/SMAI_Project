Positive 4956 pI have noticed on some of my linux servers that a linux service will be hung. The only way I know that it is hung is operations that rely on the service fails and when I restart the service it fails to stop but it starts fine. p  pIf I do codeservice ltservicenamegt statuscode it says its running, If I do a codeps ef  grep ltservicenamegtcode it only shows one process running for that service which is correct. p  pAnything else I can check to know if it is hung or not I am trying to be proactive about bringing these services back up and also determining why they are getting hung. p  pFor reference the services are mostly openstacknovacompute and openstackcindervolume. The cinder volume service I can detect with the rabbitMQ starting to build up but the same thing doesnt happen for novacompute.p  pThis is very hard to test because like I said the only way I know is if I try to do something on that node in OpenStack and it fails or gets hung, and then I restart the service.p

Ubuntu on the other hand seems to always keep up to date with latest developer packages.p  pI still got the riscvtool build.sh procedure to complete successfully. Although, a part from the hello world app that runs ok, my other apps that do run on Ubuntu riscvtools, do not run correctly on Centos riscvtools. Spike seems to be stuck in a infinite loop, without any print on the terminal my apps should print something, at least it does on Ubuntu riscvtools.p  pTherefore, I am thinking I have a setup issue. The riscvtools build procedure seems to be sensitive to the automake version used as well as the m4 version used.p  pSo I started to look for updating some of the Centos packages manually. I updated Centos with automake 1.14.1 and m4 1.4.17, to match what I have on the Ubuntu machine. Toolchain builds correctly, but still no luck running my apps.p  pHas anyone been successful building the tool chain and running simulating apps on Centos  Can someone provide a list of the packages versions they use p  pNote On Centos I have gcc 4.8.3 installed.

Ive been using an Asus N10 wireless USB dongle successfully on Windows, but when I try building and installing the driver RTL8192SU from the Asus website on CentOS I continuously run into issues. Ill do my best to outline my progress so far.p  pFirst, I downloaded the appropriate driver from a hrefhttpswww.asus.comusNetworkingUSBN10 relnofollowhttpswww.asus.comusNetworkingUSBN10a, unzipped it, and followed the instructions in the quickstart file by running make and make install. The make command returned a long list of warnings, and an error saying it couldnt find a function called daemonize. A quick Google search showed that the daemonize function has been deprecated in recent kernel updates a hrefhttpaskubuntu.comquestions290452installingworkaroundrealtekdriversforedimaxbutgettingerrorhttpaskubuntu.comquestions290452installingworkaroundrealtekdriversforedimaxbutgettingerrora, but someone had created a port so I gave it a try. No luck there, either although the port was for the RTL8192CU driver, Im not sure how different the two are.p  pBack to Google. Further research uncovered this website a hrefhttpforums.fedoraforum.orgshowthread.phpt253126 relnofollowhttpforums.fedoraforum.orgshowthread.phpt253126a. Like the other website, it wasnt for my exact driver, but feeling desperate I tried it anyway. I was able to download the zip file, but couldnt unzip it because unzip saw the file as corrupt.p  pHas anyone successfully installed the RTL8192SU Realtek driver on a Fedoracorev.3.0 system before, or knows where I can find a solution Im tempted to try ndiswrapper when I get back to the office tomorrow, but if I can find a native solution Id rather go that route.p
