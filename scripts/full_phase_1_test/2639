Positive 2639 pI had developed a program in python 2.7 wxpython for a gold merchant to add entries of clients and print these reports one by one using a dotmatrix printer. But the issue is page size of this printer is that of an envelope. So to correctly print, i must be able to set page size while using htmleasyprinting.p  pclass PrinterHtmlEasyPrinting     def stronginitstrongself         HtmlEasyPrinting.stronginitstrongselfp  precodedef GetHtmlTextself,text     Simple conversion of text.

Positive 2639 pIn my program, I have a context menu that has an Insert submenu. Instead of making a different function for each option in the submenu, I would like to bind all the options to the same function. Is there a way for me to determine the label or id of the selected item so that I can pass it to a different functionp  pEDIT After a bit of research, I found the function GetId, which is what I wanted, but I still need to get the label from the id. I might be able to use FindWindowById, which is a function of wx.Window, but it only looks through the children of the window. The frame doesnt appear to be a parent of the items in the submenu, so I cant just do codeframe.FindWindowByIdidcode. p

Negative 2639 pI am using the same stylesheet for the main site as well as a preview of the site NOT in an iframe because I need it to be interactive. The issues is, the preview does not take up 100 of the screen width, so when media queries are based on screen size, the page behaves oddly. I am ok with making the editorpreview mode fixed width, though, so I thought perhaps there is some way I can disable the mediaqueries under certain conditions I have no idea how to approach that, though. Either through javascript, or potentially loading an additional, generic stylesheet after the mediaqueries that would somehow reset things.p  pOtherwise I may have to make alternate stylesheets, which would be a pain to maintain, or redesign the page so that the preview area is 100 of the width.p
