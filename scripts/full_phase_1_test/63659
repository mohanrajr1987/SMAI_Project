Positive 63659 pHeres an overview My goal is to render an avatar using codethree.jscode on codenode.jscode server side. Then, get the data URI scheme of the outputcanvas and go from there.p  pThe reason why I want to render it serversided is to avoid users manipulating the renderproperties of the avatar. So they dont add their own texture, change colors, etc.p  pCurrently, I have this working when ran in a browser. Since I am using the codeWebGLRenderercode, I can just access the codetoDataURLcode under coderenderer.domElementcode and I can go from there.p  pHowever, my issue is I do not know which renderer to use with codenode.jscode emand still get the data codeURIcode schemeem. I can not use codeWebGLRenderercode because no browser exists, and as a result will give errors document is not defined etc... so how should I go about doing thisp

Positive 63659 pIm trying to render an animation in Three.js using a mesh from MakeHuman. The mesh loads correctly, but gets very distorted when the animation runs. If I add a SkeletonHelper, I can see that the skeleton does the animation correctly, however its orientation is different than the mesh. p  pWhen the mesh loads it is facedown and the skeleton is rightsideup. If I rotate the mesh in Three.js so it is rightsideup, then the skeleton goes upsidedown for some reason.

Thanks.p  pstrongUpdatestrong  I was able to briefly get the model to emmostlyem animate as expected with just a little distortion and the skeleton and mesh were both pointing in the same direction, but now I cant reproduce my success. Im fairly certain that in Blender either clearing or applying the rotation, location, and scale is what made the difference, but when I try to run through the steps again, I cant get it to do it anymore. The skeleton and mesh are not in sync again. That emhasem to be the problem, right p  pIm thinking I need to emapplyem the rotation and location, but emclearem the scale. However, when I try to apply the location, the scale no longer appears cleared. I guess I dont understand how Blender works. What is the proper way to clear or apply Rot,Loc,Scale Do I applyclear before or after retargeting to the BVH Maybe both Do I need to do that on each mesh andor bone p

Negative 63659 pGood dayp  pIm currently building a small website where I write down problems that arise and answers to them for others to see. Currently Im using a DAL much like the one described a hrefhttpweblogs.asp.netscottguarchive20060115435498.aspx relnofollowherea. Now I have been looking at other models, and in particular linq based models using Linq2SQL and the ADO.net Entries framework. I realize Im moving the data access to the code layer in a way since Im then filtering out for example a toplist with linq queries. The reason I started doing this was because the DAL was not really syncing up with the DB at all times and nullable types became not nullable when I changed something in the DB. Then if I would reimport the tables into the data table my queries would be lost.p  pMy simple question is really, if you want a good DAL for ASP.net today, what would that be Suggestions, experiences are more than welcome.p
