Positive 72972 pIm having a problem with using multiple UI dispatchers to modify an list that is bound to the UI. The method with just exit when it hits the first dispatcher. If I wrap the entire method in the dispatcher it works, but I have another solution but Im not sure its appropriatep  pBasically, I have a socket listening in a neverending loop for network commands from a media device. When it finds one, it calls ProcessCommand.p  pThat function calls one of 50 methods to process the specific commands. Those functions store the internal state, but mainly raise events my main application can subscribe to so it knows when something like the volume has changed and I can update the UI.p  pThese work pretty well, except the one case noted at the start where I need to modify a state object that is bound using several dispatchers in the same method and it not working, and wrapping the method in one big dispatcher seems to work.p  pAnother solution I found is to run the ProcessCommand running in the socket background listener on the UI dispatcher, iep  precode                    CoreApplication.MainView.CoreWindow.Dispatcher.RunAsyncWindows.UI.Core.CoreDispatcherPriority.Normal,  gt                                              ProcessCommandcommand                      codepre  pThis will then trickle down into all of the individual 50 ProcessCommandXYZ methods, and also in my main app where I subscribe to these events on multiple pages I currently have to use a UI dispatcher on every one, so something likep  pSocket listener background task  DispatcherUI ProcessCommand  ProcessVolumeCommand  Raise OnVolumeChangedEvent  Subscriber updates UIp  pWould make it so I dont need to put each event subscriber into a dispatcher, but most importantly fixes problem I have with multiple dispatchers in one methodp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32489503usingdispatchercorrectlyineventtoupdateuiUsing Dispatcher correctly in event to update UIap  pDoes this seem like a good solutionp
