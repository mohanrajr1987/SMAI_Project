Positive 40852 pI currently have written a simple event logger in the view of the old codeBackgroundworkercode class. I am trying to convert it to a TPL implementation. p  pI do not have enough usage with threading in C to really prefer one over the other but I do know that TPL is becoming more preferred to I wanted to stick with it as much as I can. Another reason is that with the current code I can not find an easy way to make the codeEventLogcode class thread safe. I am finding myself using codeBeginInvokecode to write to the log from non UI threads which just seems messy to me. p  pSo here is the original code.p  precodepublic class EventLog      public String LogPath  get set      public ListltLogEventgt Events  get private set       public static EventLog Instance  get  return lazyInstance.Value       private static readonly LazyltEventLoggt lazyInstance  new LazyltEventLoggt gt new EventLog      private EventLog              Events  new ListltLogEventgt         LogPath  Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly.CodeBase         LogPath  Path.GetDirectoryNameLogPath         LogPath  LogPath.Replacefile,          LogPath  LogPath  Log.txt           public override void publishLogEvent newEvent              Events.AddnewEvent         if LogEventWriter.Instance.IsBusy             LogEventWriter.Instance.RunWorkerAsyncLogPath         LogEventWriter.Instance.LogEvents.AddnewEvent        internal class LogEventWriter  BackgroundWorker      public BlockingCollectionltLogEventgt LogEvents  get set       public static LogEventWriter Instance  get  return lazyInstance.Value       private static readonly LazyltLogEventWritergt lazyInstance  new LazyltLogEventWritergt gt new LogEventWriter      private LogEventWriter              WorkerSupportsCancellation  true         LogEvents  new BlockingCollectionltLogEventgt           protected override void OnDoWorkDoWorkEventArgs e              if e.Argument  null ampamp e.Argument is String                      String logPath  Stringe.Argument             using StreamWriter logFile  new StreamWriterlogPath, true                              while CancellationPending                                      LogEvent anEvent  LogEvents.Take                     logFile.WriteLineanEvent.Message                     logFile.Flush                     if anEvent.Message.ContainsApplication Terminated                         break                                  logFile.Close                               e.Cancel  true       codepre  pMy current train of thought for the log is to write the log to a file ASAP in case of a system failure so that the log will have as much information as it can.

I have tried as best I can to wrap the logging functionality into codeTaskcodes but it I still feel like I should have a function akin to codepublishcode and not have to directly place codeLogEventcodes into a codeBlockingCollectionltgtcode so that I can run the logging on a separate thread from the main UI.p  pAlso is there a cleaner way to stop the codeTaskcodes without having to send a special codeLogEventcode to them to codebreakcode from their loopsp  precodepublic class EventLog      public static EventLog Instance  get  return lazyInstance.Value       private static readonly LazyltEventLoggt lazyInstance  new LazyltEventLoggt gt new EventLog      public String LogPath  get set      public ConcurrentQueueltLogEventgt Events  get set       private EventLog              Events  new ConcurrentQueueltLogEventgt         WriteQueue  new BlockingCollectionltLogEventgt         LogEventQueue  new BlockingCollectionltLogEventgt          LogPath  Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly.CodeBase         LogPath  Path.GetDirectoryNameLogPath         LogPath  LogPath.Replacefile,          LogPath  LogPath  LogASDF.txt          StartManager         StartWriter           public BlockingCollectionltLogEventgt LogEventQueue  get set      private void StartManager              var writeTask  Task.Factory.StartNew gt                      while true                              LogEvent anEvent  LogEventQueue.Take                 Events.EnqueueanEvent                 WriteQueue.AddanEvent                 if anEvent.Message.ContainsApplication Terminated                     break                                 private BlockingCollectionltLogEventgt WriteQueue  get set      private void StartWriter              var writeTask  Task.Factory.StartNew gt                      using StreamWriter logFile  new StreamWriterLogPath, true                              whiletrue                                      LogEvent anEvent  WriteQueue.Take                     logFile.WriteLineanEvent.Message                     logFile.Flush                     if anEvent.Message.ContainsApplication Terminated                         break                                  logFile.Close                             codepre  ol liHow can I properly use codeCancellationTokencode to cancel both of the tasks I do not see how if codeBlockingCollectioncode is blocking, I always have to pulse the collection to get it to unblock.li liIs there a cleaner way to insert an codeLogEventcode into the log without having to directly insert it into codeLogEventQueuecodeli ol

Negative 40852 pI am developing an application in Flex, using Blaze DS to communicate with a Java backend, which provides persistence via JPA Eclipse Link.p  pI am encountering issues when passing JPA entities to Flex via Blaze DS. Blaze DS uses reflection to convert the JPA entity into an ObjectProxy effectively a HashMap by calling all getter methods on the entity. This includes any lazyinitialised onemanytomany relationships.p  pYou can probably see where I am going. If I pass a single object through JPA this will call all onemanytomany methods on this object. For each returned object if they have onemanytomany relationships they will be called too. As such, by passing back a single JPA entity I actually end up doing multiple database calls and passing all related entries back as a single ObjectProxy instancep  pMy solution to date is to create a translator to convert each entity to an ObjectProxy and viceversa. This is clearly cumbersome and there must be a better way.p  pThoughts pleasep

Negative 40852 pI have been having this debate with a friend where i have a library its python but I didnt include that as a tag as the question is applicable to any language that has a few dependencies. The debate is whether to provide a default environment in the initialization or force the user of the code to explicitly set one.p  pMy opinion is to force the user as its explicit and will avoid confusion and make it clear what they are pointing to.p  pMy friend this is safer and more convenient to default to an environment and let the user override if he wants to.p  pThoughts  Are there any good references or examples  patterns in popular libraries that support either of our arguments  also, any popular blogs or articles that discuss this API design pointp
Negative 40852 pIm trying to figure out how to delete all text files from a given directory. Im using Visual c 2010 express, using winapi. Im aware of how to delete a file if you know the exact name of that file, but I would like to delete all text files within that directory. This is my latest attemptp  precodevoid deleteFiles WCHAR file[]      WCHAR file[] is actually the directory path. i.e CUsersTheUserDesktopFolder     Convert from WCHAR to char for future functions   char filePath[ MAXPATH ]   int i   for int i  0 file[ i ]  0 i          Cycle through each character from the array and place it in the new array     filePath[ i ]  file[ i ]       Place the null character at the end   filePath[ i ]  0     Generate WIN32FINDDATA struct and FindFirstFile   WIN32FINDDATA fileData   FindFirstFile file, ampfileData      Display the filename   MessageBox NULL, fileData.cFileName, LCheck, MBOK   codepre  pThe message box only displays the folder that was selected, not the filename. Why is that happeningp
