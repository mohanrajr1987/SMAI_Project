Positive 14012 pIve used and trusted Flash for over a decade but as it seems that the world is slowly turning on it, its seems fair to assume that at the very least it makes good sense to convert any new ideas into a more accepted medium.p  pBy working on a new site andor converting a new project for HTML5, is it a wise move to restructure internal design and coding to inline coding with frame based animation etc so to be able to maximise its potential with Javasscript coding etcp  pPackage based classes will obviously become redundant and using multi sectional media seems to me to be unusable in this way, am I right in thinking thisp  pAlso, having played with Unity3D, is it a viable solution to think that you could create a full interactive website in the same manner as with Flash previously and incorporate galleries and or coded interactive medie to feature within or as an overlay in this manner Also would it be possible to fuse a Unity based site with interactive media to reference galleries or alternative ways of displaying media, so if I designed a 3d shop and incorporated various sections to activate for example the help section, Q amp A, and any other sections whereby Id like to have an as3 feature activated to view, either as a pop up or an onscreen overlay etcp  pAny help to this would be gratefully recieved as it seems that with the lack of forward support from Adobe with regards to Flash, it is slowly being killed off and lacking a stable reason for people to use it.p  pThanks in advance.p

What is the best way to handle the attack arrival time.

Positive 14012 pIm building an AIRandroid app for a retail kiosk. We are going to hide the status bar so the app is fullscreen and doesnt have the soft button bar it will also be locked into kiosk mode using a 3rd party app. p  pWhen I publish and run my app on our device with the status bar hidden the flash stage colour is visible where the original status bar was. This space should be filled with the app contents fullscreen images etc but the 68px space which originally contained the bar is just solid white or whatever backgroundColor the stage is set to p  pAfter a lot of trial and error Ive nailed this down to the fact that I have renderMode set to direct in the app descriptor xml. If I remove this the app contents fill the screen, but obviously I dont have access to the GPU accelerated rendering system.p  pIm assuming this is something to do with AIR asking the devices hardware of its resolution, which it returns as 1920x1032 even though the actual number of pixels is 1920x1080. So under the hood AIR is only setting up a renderable window of 1920x1032 when in renderModedirect.p  pDoes anyone know of a way of enabling true fullscreen when in renderModedirect  p

Negative 14012 pI wrote an app just for myself that displays cropped versions of these images a hrefhttpbravelydefault.nintendo.compdfsBravelyDefaultARCards.pdf relnofollowhttpbravelydefault.nintendo.compdfsBravelyDefaultARCards.pdfap  pThey are used alongside a Nintendo 3ds game, in which the 3ds can scan the cards using the camera. Its a hassle to print them, so the app just displays the cards onscreen where the 3ds can scan them.p  pI was wondering if it would be illegal to release the app on the Play store just for other peoples convenience. I wouldnt put an ad on it or charge any money for it, and downloading the PDF is free. And I kind of feel like Square Enix probably wouldnt care, or even find out about a useless app with a low download count. However, they did take the time to put a copyright stamp on the PDF, so could I get banned from Play for uploading this app Or do you think, in the event they did want the app taken down, I would get an email first before I actually got banned p  pIm not quite sure how any of this works so any feedback would be nice. I just want to make something a little more convenient for people.p
