Negative 743 pI want to make something like a chat application for android using GCM.

I believe this is not an efficient way to transfer small amounts of data will consume more battery on the device, and more resources for my server as wellp  pI have read a hrefhttpsdeveloper.android.comgooglegcmccs.html relnofollowthisa, but I dont know how to actually get xmpp working.

So can xmpp work alongside GCM on php   p
