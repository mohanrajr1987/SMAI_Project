Positive 1709 pI have a site where I collect both the Flash screen resolution data using a .swf file and the same data from JavaScript and send it to my servers.  p  pFor some users, this data looks wrong  the Flash resolution is very occasionally larger or smaller than the reported screen resolution in the browser.  p  pFor example, one user has a code1600x900code resolution screen as reported in the JavaScript, but a screen size of code1366x768code as reported by Flash.p  pThe ActionScript properties I am using arep  ol licodeflash.system.Capabilities.screenResolutionXcodeli licodeflash.system.Capabilities.screenResolutionYcodeli ol  pThe JavaScript properties I am using arep  ol licodewindow.screen.widthcodeli licodewindow.screen.heightcodeli ol  pAre there any conditions when one would expect these values to be consistently incorrect in either ActionScript or JavaScriptp

Positive 1709 pI have this baffling problem with Flash AS3 that I have been attempting to solve for a long time. I have a notion that perhaps this is a bug with the flash player, but perhaps you can shed some insight.p  pI have a MovieClip in Flash that is a star for 10 frames, a circle for another 10, and then a square for another 10, after which it will codegotoAndPlay1code, replaying the animation.

Negative 1709 pWere developing and maintaining a couple of systems, which need to export reports in Excel format to the end user. The reports are gathered from a MySQL database with some trivial processing and usually result in 40000 rows of data with 1015 columns, were expecting the amount of data to grow steadily. p  pAt the moment were using PHPExcel for the Excel generation, but its not working for us anymore. After we go above 5000 rows, the memory consumption and loading times become untolerable, and cant be solved by indefinitely increasing PHPs maximum limits for memory usage and script execution times. Processing of the data is as lean as possible, and the entire problem is with PHPExcel being a memory hog. CSV generation would be lighter, but unfortunately were required to export Excel and Excel alone from our services due to user demands. This is due to formatting requirements etc., so CSV isnt an option.p  pAny ideasrecommendations for a third party applicationmoduleservicewhat ever for generating large excels Doesnt matter if its a commercial licence, as long as it fits our needs, can be integrated to existing PHP applications and does its job. Our services are generally running on linuxphpmysql and we can do just about whatever we need to do with the servers. p  pThanksp

Negative 1709 pIm writing a server application and its client counterpart that both use Netty for the network layer. I find myself facing typical safety concerns about sending a password from a client to the server so I decided SSL was the safest way of doing this.p  pI know of the a hrefhttpdocs.jboss.orgnetty3.2xreforgjbossnettyexamplesecurechatpackagesummary.html relnofollowsecurechata example and will use this to modify my pipelines accordingly. However, I would also like to disable SSL after password transmission and acknowledge to save a few precious CPU cycles on server side, which may be busy with many other clients. The a hrefhttpdocs.jboss.orgnetty3.2apiorgjbossnettychannelChannelPipeline.html relnofollowChannelPipelinea documentation states thatp  blockquote   pOnce attached, the coupling between the channel and the pipeline is permanent the channel cannot attach another pipeline to it nor detach the current pipeline from it.p blockquote  pThe idea is then to not change the pipeline onthefly, which is prohibited, but to somehow tell the emSslHandlerem in the pipeline that it should stop encrypting messages at some point. I was thinking of creating a class inheriting from emSslHandlerem, overriding its emhandleDownstreamem function to call emcontext.sendDownstreamevtem after some point in the communication.p  pemQuestion 1em Is this a bad idea, that is, disabling SSL at some point p  pTo allow a block in the pipeline say a emDecoderem telling another block say emSslHandlerem that it should change its behaviour from now on, I thought I could create, say, an emAtomicBooleanem in my emChannelPipelineFactoryems emgetPipelineem and pass it to the constructor of both the emDecoderem and the emSslHandlerem.p  pemQuestion 2em Is this a bad idea, that is, sharing state between pipeline blocks  Im worried I might screw up the multithreading of Netty here are the blocks of a pipeline working on a single message, one at a time  i.e. does the first block wait for the completion of the last block before pulling the next message p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pOh my bad, this is from the a hrefhttpdocs.jboss.orgnetty3.2apiorgjbossnettychannelChannelPipeline.html relnofollowChannelPipelinea page I had been visiting many times and quoting in this very questionp  blockquote   pA ChannelHandler can be added or removed at any time because a ChannelPipeline is thread safe. For example, you can insert a SslHandler when sensitive information is about to be exchanged, and remove it after the exchange.p blockquote  pSo this answers question 2 about modifying the pipelines emcontentem onthefly, and not the pipeline reference itself.p
