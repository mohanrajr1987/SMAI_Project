Negative 3829 pI have been programming with both Sinatra and Padrino for quite some time now. However, I am still not able to find the right authentication and authorization solution for Padrino. Let me explain my expectation and what I have already tried out.p  pWith Sinatra, I successfully use the a hrefhttprubygems.orggemssinatraauthenticationsinatraauthenticationa gem along with the a hrefhttprubygems.orggemsrolemodelrolemodela gem. I generally use the Mongoid ORM for talking to MongoDB. These two gems together let me take care of authetication, protecting routes, checking for roles of the logged in user for applying access control.p  psinatraauthentication doesnt work with Padrino  it is very specific to Sinatra. I tried it out multiple times. I have already tried out both omniauth and warden with the corresponding Padrino modules but for one reason or another I am not able to get them to work as simply as the wonderful sinatraautentication gem.p  pSo  before I can attempt implementing a solution of my own or porting sinatraauthentication to Padrino  can anyone suggest any other authentication and authorization solutions At the moment I dont need anythign fancy  simple databasebased authentication will just work perfectly.p
