Negative 20711 pIn .NET, TypeMock Isolator and Microsoft Moles allow one to isolate any class, property, or method  be it sealed, static, protected or nonvirtual. So what was impossible to mock in Moq or Rhino Mocks, now no longer is the case.p  pIve always had some aversion with the idea of using an interface merely to be able to allow for mocking, when otherwise just the concrete class would exist. Im not alone in this view see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions90851isitjustmeorareinterfacesoverusedherea, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions956011uselessinterfacesherea, and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions2659366javainterfacesmethodologyshouldeveryclassimplementaninterfaceherea. In the later its implied that modern mocking frameworks no longer need interfaces for testing or dependency injection.p  pHowever, while I cant speak for TypeMock Isolator, I can say that using Mocks in Microsoft Moles is extremely slow. Having code like the following in unit tests makes the speed of the test too slow to be used oftenp  precodeMFile.ReadAllLinesString  s gt csvDataCorrectlyFormatted MDirectoryInfo.AllInstances.GetFilesString  di,fi gt fileInfoArray MFileInfo.AllInstances.NameGet  fi gt Doesnt Matter codepre  pIm sure that if the method being tested was programmed to an interface or abstract base class so that the file system code could be abstracted away in a wrapper of sorts that using frameworks like Moq for stubbing or mocking would end up being faster. But then we are back to the situation of having added production code complexity for basically the ability to unit test.p  pIm leaning to the opinion that Isolator and Moles should only be used when one cant mock with traditional mocking frameworks. Yet, I still struggle with notion of having added production code complexity for the sake of testing. p  pIm curious what the rest of the community thinks.p  pstrongUPDATE 100610strong By saying I struggle with the notion of having added production code complexity for the the sake of testing, Im referring to the adding an interface or abstract class even when otherwise one isnt needed, such as when making the concrete class nonsealed and methods virtual would do. The latter still allows seams for testing. Even if later one finds the need to use an interface for multiple implementations, couldnt they extract it from the class But unless that need arises, why not follow a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiYouain27tgonnaneeditYAGNIa. p  pIm all for the SOLID principles where they make the architecture of a program easier to maintain. I dont think these principles need to be followed religiously in every case. I think the mantra, It always depends, comes into play many times. Otherwise, one is left with every concrete type having an interface or abstract base class, even when there will be only one implementation.p  pLastly, Im not saying that because Isolator and Moles allows one to get around isolation limitations in dynamicproxybased frameworks that one shouldnt still design architecture to be maintainable. In many cases, the SOLID principles are what is best, and thus Isolator or Moles wouldnt be needed. Its the cases where the interface is used solely for testing that I am questioning. Im bringing up another side point about speed too. If one chooses to use Isolator and Moles it appears to bring a speed penalty. So I certainly dont think that they make dynamicproxybased frameworks obsolete.p
