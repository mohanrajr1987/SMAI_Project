Positive 1046 pSo ive been working in XNA for about 1 year now and have been working on this big project for that time, Its got Component based architecture, 1.5D worlds, a custom world editor and entity editor, and alot more. But here is my problem i wanted my friend to join the project but sense XNA is Dead it dosnt work with VS newer then 2010 and i wanted to use github to let my friend help with the project. So what i did was look around the internet to find a solution. What i found was that the community remade XNA and called it MonoGame so they could port it to other platforms and use it in newer VS. but as i went on i found out that it was a extension of XNA it was a re write. so what im asking is, Can i port my code to Mono with little to no changes and if i do need to make changes what do i need to dop  pA good way to reply to this question would be like so Yes you would need to change some of you code but not all Some things you would need to change 1 SpritBatch is called  in mono gamep  pThanks for reading and answering my question. cp
Positive 1046 pIm working on a 2D game, and right now Im facing a problem that I cant proceed without solving it.

Positive 1046 pI need to interface with Xbox 360 controllers and my limited knowledge leaves me stuck with C. I dont want to use XNA and require users to have it installed for this simple thing, so Im using SlimDX to allow me to interface with XInput. I have been able to detect all button presses and the little program is coming along...but I need to know how to poll  know when a button is pressed, to then trigger events.p  pRight now I have a timer running at 10ms and it checks which buttons are pressed and behaves based on that. But lets say you press X for one second  it detects X was pressed 100 times because well, every 10ms, X was pressed. I want to fire up my events only when the button is pressed, and not have to depend on a timer.p  pIs it possible with SlimDX on C If so, how If not, is there a betterlower latency XInput wrapper for C that will do what I needp  pThanks in advancep

Positive 1046 pIm having difficulty of knowing how to approach or how to tackle this problem. Ive looked at some tutorials but they are meant for programmers that already know what theyre doing. I followed a video on how to perform a form of pixel collision that applies to regular bounding boxes, where if the bounding boxes collide it checks if any nontransparent pixel in both intersecting boxes are overlapping. If they do, then a boolean will return a true value. Where and how could I start to implement the changing of the bounding boxs axis in a rotating object to compliment the textures appreance I wouldnt prefer being pointed to an external tutorial because most of the ones Ive read assumes the programmer knows everything the writer is talking about.p  pIve also looked at some source code that perfectly demonstrates what Im looking for, but it seems I need a very in depth explanation to make any use of reading code as well.p
