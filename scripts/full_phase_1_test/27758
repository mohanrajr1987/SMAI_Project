Positive 27758 pI have an app that uses XIB and not Storyboard.  The rootViewController is a TabBarController.  There are 5 tabs, and each tab contains a NavigationController.  What I would like to do, is have the app PUSH a certain view controller whenever the user taps on a received Push Notification.

Positive 27758 pSo I have a codeUINavigationControllercode stack. One of the codeUIViewControllerscode in this stack has a codeUIButtoncode that adds a Child codeUIViewControllercode to achieve a modal appearance it is a menu that has blurred, semitransparent background. The code is below and is working great.p  precode        var childVC  storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierExtra as UIViewController         childVC.view.frame  CGRectMake0, 0, self.view.frame.width, UIScreen.mainScreen.bounds.height          self.navigationController.addChildViewControllerchildVC         self.navigationController.didMoveToParentViewControllerchildVC         self.navigationController.view.addSubviewchildVC.view codepre  pBut inside the Child codeUIViewControllercode I need to push a UIViewController on top of stack i.e. on the Parent UIViewController. I have tried a bunch of things but the best I can get is it bringing up a blank screen with codeself.navigationController.pushViewControllercode  this runs the code in the next UIViewController e.g. it prints to console but obviously has the problem of showing a blank screen. I have also tried         codeself.parentViewController.navigationController.pushViewControllercodep  pstrongEDITstrong also, if I print out the stacks         codeprintlnself.navigationController.viewControllerscode in the codeviewDidLoadcode of the top UIViewController i.e. the one showing up blank. It prints as expected the first codeUIViewControllercode, the modal codeUIViewControllercode and the top codeUIViewControllercode.p

Positive 27758 pHaving a strange issue here, developing an iOS app that uses a number of navigation controllers. After a number of views have been pushed seguewise onto the stack, the last action when the task is done is to pop the stack, this happens using the method codecontroller.navigationController.popViewControllerAnimatedfalsecode. p  pNow this all seems to work fine, except that sometimes the navigation item titles, seem to be pushed off to the left of the navigation bar. Its almost as if an animation has been cut off short. Sometimes it doesnt happen though, which is the stranger part.p  pIm not directly messing with the navigation bar in any way or form, touching the frame, changing positions or anything of the sort.p  pHeres a picture of what I mean.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.commCGlk.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.commCGlk.png altenter image description hereap  pAs far as I am aware, Feed should be centered, unless this is some new asymmetric design Apple has introduced into iOS8 Swift apps.p
Positive 27758 pMy initial view controller is a login page, which checks if the current user is logged in. If so, a segue is performed to the next view, which is to a tab bar controller, whose default selected tab is a table view that has been embedded in a navigation controller.p  pWithin this table view is a list of event objects. When a user selects an event object, the event details display in a new view, and the navigation bar appears above, allowing the user to return back to their list of events. This is all working properly.p  pHowever, the application has a URL scheme that allows it to be launched via a URL. Within my app Delegate, I am able to capture the URL scheme and query I need. p  pMy problem is when I try to present the necessary view controller. Im actually able to present the view controller which is an event details view controller, but this view controller is not within the navigation hierarchy, which I need. Cant figure out how to do this again the below code is within the openURL function of appDelegate, which is called via my custom URL Schemep  precode        let storyboard  UIStoryboardname Main, bundle nil          the viewController to present         let viewController  storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierSingleEventAfterCreationViewController as SingleEventAfterCreationViewController          let eventListNavController  storyboard.instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifierEventsListNavigationController as UINavigationController  set a bunch of properties on my viewController  below is where Im unsure. The correct view controller is presented, but the navigation bar above, and tab bar below is lost. Subsequently, when I click on a user of the event, the program crashes, Im guessing because there is no navigation hierarchy.   self.window.rootViewController  eventListNavController                  self.window.rootViewController.presentViewControllerviewController, animated true, completion nil codepre  pThe crash textp  blockquote   pTerminating app due to uncaught exception NSGenericException, reason Could not find a navigation controller for segue showProfileSegue.
