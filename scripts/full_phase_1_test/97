Positive 97 pI have a created two separate C web application using EF6 one with Database First and other with Code First approach. everything is going on smoothly but after sometime it is required to merge both. After merging , Database is same for Code First Approach. Initial I was using MigrateDatabasetoLatestVersion for database initializer. So when I try to run my application , it throws error related to Table is already exist. I have also tried with Package manager console to update migration and it throws same error. and so I was not able to run the new solution on same database.p  pFor resolving this issue, I have changed database initializer to CreateDatabaseifNotExist. and after that I am able to use this database with my new solutions.p  pBut the Problem arise, when I tried to add a new column to existing table or Creating a new table with Code First approach. Since there is no migration so it skips to alteradd table and for that I have to manually run AlterAdd table Script with each changes.p  pIs there any valid solution for this  either MigrateDatabasetoLatestVersion doesnt throw exception or it is not required to run db script each time.p  pThanks.p

Positive 97 pThis is a common practice that people working on django project usually push migrations to the version control system along with other code.p  pMy question is why this practice is so common Why not just push the updated models and everyone generate migrations locally. This approach can reduce the effort for resolving migrations conflicts too.p
Positive 97 pIve just inherited a blog platform that uses Rails 3.2 , and Im looking to add some functionality.

Positive 97 pOur GAE doesnt not currently declare any modules, and wed like to convert it, as a hrefhttpscloud.google.comappenginedocspythonmodulesconverting relnofollowdescribed herea, and then add a 2nd module, for doing backend workp  pIm confused about how I can test the new modular configuration in a testing environment i.e. a testing version wo the module declarations leaking into our default version called prod. Our normal development process is to deploy new code to a test version. e.g. in app.yamlp  pwe changep  pcodeversion prodcodep  ptop  pcodeversion testingcodep  p..and then deploy. Once its working we switch back to codeversion prodcode and deploy again.

Negative 97 pWe have a system that allows Administrators to build out new content types within the system, including foreign key linkages to other tables.
