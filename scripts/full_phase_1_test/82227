Negative 82227 pI am using Z3 to solve satisfiability problems including several hundred XOR clauses with 22 inputs each. To code the XOR clauses in DIMACS form, I am using Tseitin encoding. My conversion breaks the XORs down to smaller CNF clauses with up to five literals each. Z3 so far is not able to devise a SAT solution.p  pWhat couldshould I do to improve my encodingp  pI have looked at Gaussian elimination, but this probably does not help, because the XOR expressions do not have the same input variables. p

Negative 82227 pim in the process of upgrading an ASP.NET MVC 2 application to ASP.NET MVC 3. One of the improvements in version 3 i have read about is with dependency injection and the inbuilt service locator. So far my understanding is that i can remove my implentation of the controller factory and instead implement the IDependencyResolver interface. Now all i have to do is change the following in my ApplicationStart methodp  precodevar container  new UnityContainer ... ServiceLocator.SetLocatorProvider gt new UnityServiceLocatorcontainer ControllerBuilder.Current.SetControllerFactorynew UnityControllerFactorycontainer codepre  ptop  precodevar container  new UnityContainer ... DependencyResolver.SetResolvernew UnityDependencyResolvercontainer codepre  pSo far so good, but ive seen reports that i also need to implement IControllerActivator. The examples i have seen simply shows how this uses the dependency resolver so i cant see why the default implementation doesnt do this automatically. If someone could explain this that would be great. Im guessing i need to implement this interface to get constructor injection within my controllers. But how would i inject a dependency within say an action filter. Before i would have saidp  precodevar authorizationService  ServiceLocator.Current.GetInstanceltIAuthorizationServicegt codepre  pI know i could probably switch this out to use the new DependencyResolver but i thought that with ASP.NET MVC 3 it would allow me to tidy this up otherwise i dont see how the DependencyResolver is any different from the ServiceLocator.p  pId appreciate if you could help clarify a few of my issues as i like to understand something fully before i go ahead and implement it.p  pThanksp
