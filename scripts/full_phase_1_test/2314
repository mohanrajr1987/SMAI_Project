Positive 2314 pThis one will be quick, I have to make a program that checks to see if a password is valid or not. It has to be atleast 8 characters, have one lower, one upper case char, and atleast one special char to be valid. Otherwise, the password will be invalid.

Ill admit I dont understand the standard references and why a contiguous block of int couldnt be accessed via int if properly aligned.  p  pFirst is the following code block valid on most C platformsp  precodevoid answerint pData, sizet nElements      for sizet i0 iltnElements i          pData[i]  42   void randomcode      int arr1[1][2][3][4]                local allocation     answerarr1, sizeofarr1  sizeofint     int arr2[20][15]     answerarr2, sizeofarr2  sizeofint  codepre  pSecond does codeanswercode remain valid for all allocation types global, local, heaphopefully correctp  precodeint garr[20][15]  global void foo      int pData[10]  new int[50][10]   heap allocation, at least partially     answeramppData[0][0], 5010      not even sure if delete[] will free pData correctly, but...  codepre
Negative 2314 pI am building a few static c libraries lib1 relies on nothing, lib2 and lib3 rely on lib1, and lib4 relies on lib1 and lib3. Finally, the goal is to have a all of these compiled into a single framework for easy consumption.p  pAs a fledgling mac developer, I am interested in the right way if one exists to organize these libraries within Xcode. My thoughts are to have 1 project per library, and a project containing the other 4 projects and builds into the framework, but Ive also seen situations where only a single project exists, with different files compiled per target.p  pIs there a best practice here, or any significant benefits of one option over the other Or is this just a style decisionp
Negative 2314 pSo Ive been using Smalltalk for about 6 months now Squeak and Pharo, mostly doing data analytics, and Im about to start my first Seaside app. So my question to all you Smalltalkers out there is, what is your favorite persistence solution Ive been looking at Magma, GOODS, and GLORP. Im a longtime python hacker, so I get ORM, but it seems like Magma or GOODS would be a better solution, since they seem objectoriented.p  pA quick note I want to scale my app across multiple VMs, so just saving data to the image wont really work.p  pThanksp
