Positive 27066 pWe are facing very weird issue in Sitecore CMS site, we are unable to see the content of the item in any version any language in content tree.Even the templates fields are missing. Earlier it was working absolutely fine we were able to view all the items in content tree in all languages. We coulnt find any thing in the sitecore log although we queried Master DB and the items are there in different version in item table. We restored the master DB and after that everything is back to normal but the content is lost for that specific period which was uploaded by content author. We are still looking for the root cause of the issue because client is very much scared if this problem occurs again in future. Any help will be appreciated.

Positive 27066 pIm just starting to learn Laravel and decided to build a new version of my current CMS system with Laravel 5.1. It will be a CMS with one admin and multiple sites.p  pI figured that since each site will be using different assets in the public folder, I would need to create different public folder for each app.p  pSo instead of apppublic, I have appsitesAdmin with its own unique css files, images, etc. Ive already built the Admin part, with its proper views, assets, models, controllers, etc, and its apparently working fine.p  pSo when I started developing the Time da ANABB site, I followed the same process created its own controllers in its own folder, its own views, etc.p  pBut when I tried it out, the route does point to the proper view, but all my links to CSS, imgs, etc are broken. When I output  publicpath  on this sites view, I get it point to CUsersMartinDropboxwwwsistemalengropublicp  pSo Im not sure if I need to config a different public folder for each site and if thats the right thing to do or if Im all wrong... Again, this is basically my first major project in laravel...p  pSome of my configs arep  pIm using Virtual Hosts and route groups to address each request, as inp  pcode Admin Routegroup[middleware  auth, domain  dev.sistema, namespace  Admin], function   Routegetadmin, function   return viewadmin.painel  p  pSite Routegroup[domain  dev.timedaanabb, namespace  TimeDaAnabb], function   Routeget, function   return viewsites.timedaanabb.pages.home   codep  pIve also created a controllers folder for each, like appHttpControllersAdmin and appHttpControllersTimeDaAnabb. For the Models, will be appAdminUsers.php, for example.p  pI dont know if thats the best approach, but its working fine so far.p  pThank you in advancep

Negative 27066 pMy situation looks like this my program is closed source software in form of injected dll designed to reside in another process. Some of libraries used in my injected dll are mostly statically linked under BSD or MIT license as i suppose im allowed to do that but other are under LGPL so I have to use them when as dlls, because static linking is not allowed correct me if wrong. So how can I make injected dll to work with other dll When i try to just compile libs as dlls, injected dll is crashing, statically linking them works.p  pEDIT My dll is injected by this functionp  precodebool InjectLibraryHANDLE hProcess, char fnDll           BOOL success  FALSE         HANDLE hThread  NULL         char fnRemote  NULL         FARPROC procLoadLibraryA  NULL          sizet lenFilename  strlenfnDll  1           Allocate space in the remote process          fnRemote  char VirtualAllocExhProcess, NULL, lenFilename, MEMCOMMIT, PAGEREADWRITE          if fnRemote                Write the filename to the remote process.              if WriteProcessMemoryhProcess, fnRemote, fnDll, lenFilename, NULL                    Get the address of the LoadLibraryA function                  procLoadLibraryA  GetProcAddressGetModuleHandleKernel32, LoadLibraryA                 hThread  CreateRemoteThreadhProcess, NULL, 0, LPTHREADSTARTROUTINEprocLoadLibraryA, fnRemote, 0, NULL                  if hThread                      WaitForSingleObjecthThread, INFINITE                     success  TRUE                                            VirtualFreeExhProcess, fnRemote, 0, MEMRELEASE                   return success      codepre  pSo how does injected dll know where are dlls that it was compiled with to use and how it loads them if does or maybe it checks existance of dll in process where it actually is injected. Should I inject used dll to that process by same method before Trying but crash.p  pEDIT2 Well maybe crash wasnt precise as i see now. After executing InjectLibrary to inject my dll I get message box, which I was thinking was just crash report but it is Windows  System Error  Exception Processing Message.. many random memory adreses... with OK button, and nothing happens later. Looks like such dll which is using another dll doesnt want to be loaded.p
