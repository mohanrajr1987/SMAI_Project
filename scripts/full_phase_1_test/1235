Positive 1235 pI would like to add a footer to a CListCtrl.p  pCurrently I do it by dynamically resizing the control to add a CStatusBar underneath with record count, selected count etc and this works well most of the time.p  pI would however like to use OnEraseBkgnd to draw a box at the bottom of the control that has this information.p  pThe problem is that if the number of records in the CListCtrl fills the control there is no room to draw this information.p  pIf you add a CHeaderCtrl to a CListCtrl, the control must know to move the first record down to accommodate the header, my question is, is it possible to tell a CListCtrl to list less records per page, thereby creating space at the bottom of the control for a footer to be drawnp
Positive 1235 pIn our project, we have a application which is used to host controls. For some reason, the application can not insert manifest for Microsoft Common Control v6.0.p  pWe create a new activeX control using ATL. and defined ISOLATIONAWAREENABLED in stdafx.h. We have also add manifest for comCtl32.dllv6.0. The buttons or combobox that created by ATL or Win32 in this control could show with visual style. p  pBut, if the controls are created by MFC, e.g. CButtonCreate,  they will be shown without visual style. Ive tried many solutions, including using ActiveContext API. But, this issue still cannot be fixed.p  pOur complier is VS2013.  Can anyone helped about thisp
Positive 1235 pIm working on a program to display image from IR camera.  My problem is that I need some points in which the temperature will be measured. In an earlier version of the program I had just five of those points, so setting their coordinates or alarm value was simple, they were displayed in a group box next the the image control. Now I would like to extend the program to let it set up to a hundred measurement points. The thing is, I dont know how to organise the point controls. I imagine it as having a combobox which allows to choose one of the points 099 and then displaying its properties pageX,Y,alarm temp, enable check box.p
Positive 1235 psearchname first parameter is fullname and second parameter is substring. In first while loop it is checking first character from name that matches with first character of substring.

Positive 1235 pSo I have a SDI MFC application which worked flawlessly on Windows XP amp Server 2003.p  pI had to update the project to VS 2013, and since then the application cannot properly load the ribbon anymore.p  pI had to set the toolkit to Visual Studio 2013  Windows XP v120xp for the app to even load on XP, which it does, but then it cant load the ribbon.p  pIve narrowed it down to the call to LoadFromResource which fails without much details. Since 2003 is no longer a supported platform for the remote debugger, I cant investigate much.p  pI also cant go back to 2010, since the project utilizes features from the v120 CRT, and it would require a lot of tweaking.p  pHere is the code. As you can see its able to create the ribbon, but it cant load it from the resource.p  precodebool ribbonCreatedSuccesfully  ribbonBargtCreateCWnd this  if ribbonCreatedSuccesfully      ribbonBargtRemoveAllCategories      if ribbonBargtLoadFromResourceIDRRIBBON1           fails here codepre  pThe application is statically linked and works correctly on all later platforms 2008, Win7, ....p  pI know its a long shot to get this figured out, but Im hoping that somebody may have run into a similar issue.p
Positive 1235 pIm developing a MFC application using MVC pattern. I use the MFC Dialog class as controller and a model class for the model,  a view class that holds the model class as a member for the view. The data in the model is organized in a tree structure, as displayed in this diagramp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comhu9ft.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhu9ft.png altlthttpi.stack.imgur.com4FOJt.pnggt.ap  pIn the diagram, the capital letter stands for a class name, so the data in the model is a tree of objects, each of which contains many data member, including the reference to the subobject, like pointer of subobject or array of subobjectsp  pBut the problem is that when the view display or update the data in the model on the UI, it need to access the data members of every node object on every level, which requires including head files of those node objects so as to retrieve their data members. So the method of Drawing UI in the cpp file of the View class looks like thisp  precodeinclude B.h include C.h include D.h include E.h include F.h include G.h void ViewDrawCDC pDC        A a Model.A        B b1A.b1        B b2A.b2       for int i0 iltb1.arrayofC.size i                   C cb1.arrayofC[i]            int lengthc.getlength            int jc.arrayofD.size            while jgt0                           D dc.arrayofD[j]               CString Named.Name               ...               j                        ....              for int i0 iltb2.arrayofC.sizei                   C cb2.arrayofC[i]            double startc.start            double endc.end            int jc.arrayofD.size            while jgt0                           D dc.arrayofD[j]               CString Named.Name               ...               j                        ....         codepre  pThis makes the code very messy and its obvious that there is a tight coupling between the model and the view. How can I make them highly independent to each other so as to ensure the maintainability or scalability of my application.p

Negative 1235 pIm cloning the home page of a website and while I was tracing and copying their codes I saw that my vertical scroll bar has doubled when I got to the container part.

It will just appear if the other vertical scroll bar is there and I think it has something to do with this clearfix thing and I still dont understand how it work.
