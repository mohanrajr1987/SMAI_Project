Positive 6409 pWe are using wordpress, Paid membership pro plugin for membership, Theme My LOGIN plugin for login and signup, so users after signup will be stored in membership table and wpuser table.p  pI have a website running on data.xyz.com. This website I have created for one specific country. I have just started using wordpress. I am not an expert.p  pNow I want to create same website for another two countries. I have to do like data.xyz.comuk and data.xyz.comus. Well I basically want all pages in new subdirectory with just new country specific database. So design and everything will look very similar on data.xyz.com and data.xyz.comuk only difference will be different database. p  pEven I dont require separate wordpress installation. All my users and plugins are already there. So, after login user can go to any country and purchase data.   p  pI dont know how I can do it. Should I create folder under my theme directory  if I do so how can I access my current page templates for another country Can I create new page templates under the new folder which I have created I am not sure if wordpress works this way. Basically I dont have any idea which way I should go.p  pMore Information My current website is for Australian products. Under same website I want to display UK and US products which will come from separate product tables. p  pI came up with a solution something like this 1 xyz.com is my core website with Australian database 2 I will create two subdirectories xyz.comuk and xyz.comus 3 Under these directories I want all template files to render same UI and functionalities as I have for Australian database. Only I need to change is dbconfig.php file where I have product database connection. Also need to change some of the prices from UI.p  pTo do this I have created Multisite network. Created two subdirectories UK and US. but this directories dont share wpuser from my australian website. Its a problem I want any user can go to any of product databases and purchase it. I dont know whether its possible or not.p  pLooking for solution... p

Clicking directly on the spin buttons was working perfectly.p  pThe same was happening for the Base angle and  fields of the Nesting formp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdy7H7.png altNestingp  pMy hypothesis it is happening because the fields are inside a groupboxp  pWhat I did to test it I changed the groupbox dimensions in the teo froms, in a way that the nonworking fields are not overlaping itp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comdwLNc.png altPart Orientation Modifiedp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comLZcFG.png altNesting Modifiedp  pThe results The mouse wheel began to work on the controls of the Part Orientation dialog.

Nesting is a form inside a CMFCTabControl, inside CDialogBar, inside a CDockablePane, inside the CMainFramethis one is derived from CFrameWndExp  pNow, my suspects  For the form Part Orientation Dialog, I suspect the groupbox is eating the mouse wheel event. For the Nesting Dialog, I suspect the DockablePane is eating the mousewheel event. Or maybe an implicit CTabbed Pane, created by the Layout of panes Ive designed or even the MainFrame.p  pMy question is How can I make the mousewheel work on spin button controlled textboxes that are inside groupboxes I have many more cases of this in my App Dialogs.p  pIs there a way that I can make the mouse wheel movement being processed by who should do it The same question applies to the Nesting Form controls which groupbox area has been removed and mouse wheel continued to not make the spinbutton movep  pThanks in advance, Srgiop
