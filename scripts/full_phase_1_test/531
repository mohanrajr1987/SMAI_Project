Positive 531 pI am new to python and wanted to make a simple script that acted like the codelscode command in a maclinux terminal but for cmd in windows. The code itself works and if I run the script using codepython lsscript.pycode in my codecmdcode it works fine. However, I want to make it so that I can run it in any active directory by just typing in codelscode in my codecmdcode. I made an environment variable in codecmdcode called codelscode that has a value of codepython ....lsscript.pycode, which assumed would work since if i were to type that exact thing in manually, it works. However, when I just type in codelscode, it gives the following errorp  blockquote   pls is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program, or batch file.p blockquote

Negative 531 pI have many XML files in the workbench Project Explorer, each one an instance of one of ten different ecore models.  For each ecore model I would like to contribute a codecommonFiltercode to the navigators codenavigatorContentcode extension point to enable the user to show or hide the corresponding XML files. These are external tool files so there is not a way to identify the content merely by observing the file name or the codexmlcode extension, and renaming is not feasible.  Using perhaps a class deriving from codeorg.eclipse.jface.viewers.ViewerFiltercode, what is the best way to identify which of the ecore models the XML file contains  I presume there is a simple way to do this with EMF resources, or with codeEcoreUtilcode, or with adapters, but I havent found a successful technique.  Alternatively, a way to do this directly from the extension points codefilterExpressioncode or the viewers codeviewerContentBindingcode would be fine. All of the codegenmodelcodederived plugins are available for the various ecore models.   p  precodepackage com.my.navigator import org.eclipse.core.resources.IFile import org.eclipse.jface.viewers.Viewer import org.eclipse.jface.viewers.ViewerFilter   public class MyViewerFilter extends ViewerFilter   public MyViewerFilter    Override public boolean selectViewer viewer, Object parentElement, Object element          if  element instanceof IFile               IFile file  IFileelement              check whether file is one of our ecore models...              ...                   return true        codepre
