Positive 7407 pIve seen a lot of good answers to this question, such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions8440490prettyurlsinphpframeworksPretty URLs in PHP frameworksa, however they all explicitly exclude existing files and directories, existing .php files, the index.php file itself andor .css.jsetc. I want emeverythingem directed to the index.php file, including the index.php file, where I can choose what to do with it dynamically, such as compression and minifying of cssjs files or 404ing most files that really exist.p  pIve been trying many things to get this done with varying and weird effects and looking at other answers for help, but theres always problems with whatever method I try. The closest working method Ive found is also the simplest...p  precodeRewriteRule . index.phppath0 [L] codepre  pHowever, the problem is that when I go to an existing folder without entering the trailing  e.g. codelocalhosttestcode it redirects to codelocalhosttestcode  which it doesnt do if the directory doesnt exist on the server. This creates the very distinction between things that actually exist on the server and URL rewrites which I am trying to get rid of.p  pWhats weirder, if I go to code127.0.0.1testcode which may be a fix if some DNS cache quirk is causing this, it redirects to codehttp127.0.0.1testpathtestcode, which is totally bizarre especially since going to code127.0.0.1testcode avoids redirection completely, as intended, and no code[R]code was specified in the rewrite, and reveals the very kind of query stringy URL which I am trying to destroy. codevarvaluecode makes a much better format for query strings, but I digress. Of course, redirection doesnt happen with code127.0.0.1testacode because the file doesnt exist, so Apache just seems to be doing something intentional I really dont want it to.p  hr  pAlso, since it is odd I couldnt find any other examples of this being done, are there any big downsides this I hypothesise that aside from a slight amount of additional server load from starting up PHP and executing whatever it has to, there shouldnt be any problems  oh, and of course errors could destroy access to everything hosted.
