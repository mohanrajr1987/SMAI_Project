Positive 1925 pI was reading a lecture note on Haskell when I came across this paragraph a hrefhttpwww.seas.upenn.educis194lectures02lists.html relnofollowhttpwww.seas.upenn.educis194lectures02lists.htmlap  blockquote   pThis not caring is what the parametric in parametric polymorphism means. All Haskell functions must be parametric in their type parameters the functions must not care or make decisions based on the choices for these parameters. A function cant do one thing when a is Int and a different thing when a is Bool. Haskell simply provides no facility for writing such an operation. This property of a langauge is called parametricity.p      pThere are many deep and profound consequences of parametricity. One consequence is something called type erasure. Because a running Haskell program can never make decisions based on type information, all the type information can be dropped during compilation. Despite how important types are when writing Haskell code, they are completely irrelevant when running Haskell code. This property gives Haskell a huge speed boost when compared to other languages, such as Python, that need to keep types around at runtime. Type erasure is not the only thing that makes Haskell faster, but Haskell is sometimes clocked at 20x faster than Python.p blockquote  pWhat I dont understand is how are all Haskell functions parametric Arent types explicitstatic in Haskell Also I dont really understand how type erasure improves strikecompiling timestrike runtimep  pSorry if these questions are really basic, Im new to Haskell.p  pEDITp  pOne more question why does the author say that Despite how important types are when writing Haskell code, they are completely irrelevant when running Haskell codep
Positive 1925 pI frequently have occasion to perform modular arithmetic in Haskell, where the modulus is usually large and often prime like 2000000011.  Currently, I just use functions like modAdd m a b, modMul m a b, modDiv m a b etc.  But that is rather inconvenient, requiring an additional parameter to always be specified and carried around and creating my various functions in both the regular integral form and separately in mod form.p  pSo it occurs that it might be a good idea to create a new class something like thisp  precodeclass Integral a gt Mod a  m  2000000011  instance Integral a gt Num Mod a where    ... defining , etc. as modulo m codepre  pThen one could just perform regular arithmetic, using regular functions, and define useful structures likep  precodefactorials  [Mod Int] factorials  1zipWith  factorials [1..] codepre  pBut that has one problem All values of type Mod Int necessarily must have the same modulus.  However, often I need to work in multiple moduli in one program of course always only combining values of the same modulus.p  pI think, but do not understand sufficiently well to be sure, that this could be overcome by something like thisp  precodeclass Integral a gt Mod Nat a codepre  pwhere Nat is a type that encodes the modulus in Peano fashion.  This would be advantageous I could have values of different moduli and the typechecker would save me from accidentally combining this value.p  pIs something like this feasible and efficient  Will it cause either the compiler or the RTS to try to actually construct the enormous Succ Succ Succ ... repeated 2000000011 times if I try to use that modulus, rendering the solution effectively useless  Will the RTS try to check the type match on every operation  Will the RTS representation of every value be blown up from what could otherwise be just an unboxed intp  pIs there a better wayp  h2CONCLUSIONh2  pThanks to helpful comments from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers414413cirdeccirdeca, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers1477667dfeuerdfeuera, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers866915user5402user5402a, and a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comusers286871tikhonjelvistikhonjelvisa, I learned that unsurprisingly I was not the first to have this idea.
