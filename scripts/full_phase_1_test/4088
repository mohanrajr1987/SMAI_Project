Positive 4088 pWe are dealing with a SerDes system with a high throughput. To ensure word alignment, I need to estimate the number of bits we need to bitslip.p  pFor example if the input is 14b 11111110000000 but the decoded output is 14b 01111111000000 then clearly we need to bitslip by 1 bit. p  pDue to the timing constraints on this we cannot afford the time to iterativly shift and compare.p  pIs there any simple single clock cycle bitwise comparison can can estimate the number of bits we need to slip, perhaps XOR etcp  pThanks in advance. p

I could just use log2 to achieve this, but this seems like something that could easily be solved by bit twiddling techniques. I could also loop through all the bits like thisp  precodedef getSetBitnum     if num  0         return 1      bit  0     while num  1         bit  1         num gtgt 1      return bit   getBitSet0b100000  5  getBitSet1  0 codepre  pHowever this to me seems awkward and slower than it should be.

Positive 4088 pcoderootn floatt x, intt ncode is a function that computes the emnemth root xsup1nsup and is supported by some programming languages such as  a hrefhttpswww.khronos.orgregistryclsdk1.2docsmanxhtmlrootn.htmlOpenCLa. When IEEE754 floatingpoint numbers are used, efficient lowaccuracy starting approximations for any codencode can be generated based on simple manipulation of the underlying bit pattern, assuming only normalized operands codexcode need to be processed.p  pThe binary exponent of coderoot x, ncode will be 1n of the binary exponent of codexcode. The exponent field of an IEEE754 floatingpoint number is biased. Instead of unbiasing the exponent, dividing it, and rebiasing the result, we can simply divide the biased exponent by codencode, then apply an offset to compensate for the previously neglected bias. Furthermore, instead of extracting, then dividing, the exponent field, we can simply divide the  entire operand codexcode, reinterpreted as an integer. The required offset is trivial to find as an argument of 1 will return a result of 1 for any codencode. p  pIf we have two helper functions at our disposal, codeintasfloatcode which reinterpretes an IEEE754 codebinary32code as codeint32code, and codefloatasintcode which reinterpretes an codeint32code operand as codebinary32code, we arrive at the following lowaccuracy approximation to coderootn x, ncode in straightforward fashionp  precoderootn x, n  intasfloatintfloatasint1.0f1.01.0n  floatasintxn codepre  pThe integer division codefloatasint x  ncode can be reduced to a shift or multiplication plus shift by a hrefhttpsgmplib.orgtegedivcnstpldi94.pdfwellknown optimizations of integer division by constant divisora. Some worked examples arep  precoderootn x,  2  intasfloat 0x1fc00000  floatasint x  2   sqrt x rootn x,  3  intasfloat 0x2a555556  floatasint x  3   cbrt x rootn x, 1  intasfloat 0x7f000000  floatasint x  1   rcp x rootn x, 2  intasfloat 0x5f400000  floatasint x  2   rsqrt x rootn x, 3  intasfloat 0x54aaaaaa  floatasint x  3   rcbrt x codepre  pWith all these approximations, the result will be exact only when codexcode  2supnmsup for integer codemcode. Otherwise, the approximation will provide an overestimation compared to the true mathematical result. We can approximately halve the emmaximum relative errorem by reducing the offset slightly, leading to a balanced mix of underestimation and overestimation. This is easily accomplished by a binary search for the optimal offset that uses all floatingpoint numbers in the interval [1, 2supnsup as test cases. Doing so, we findp  precoderootn x, 2  intasfloat 0x1fbb4f2e  floatasintx2  max rel err  3.47474e2 rootn x, 3  intasfloat 0x2a51067f  floatasintx3  max rel err  3.15547e2 rootn x,1  intasfloat 0x7ef311c2  floatasintx1  max rel err  5.05103e2 rootn x,2  intasfloat 0x5f37642f  floatasintx2  max rel err  3.42128e2 rootn x,3  intasfloat 0x54a232a3  floatasintx3  max rel err  3.42405e2 codepre  pSome may notice that the computation for coderootn x,2code is basically the initial portion of a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiFastinversesquarerootQuakes fast inverse square roota.p  pBased on observing the differences between the original raw offset, and the final offset emoptimized to minimize the maximum relative errorem, I could formulate a heuristic for the secondary correction and thus the final, optimized, offset value.p  pHowever, I am wondering whether it is possible to determine the optimal offset by some closedform formula, such that the maximum absolute value of the relative error, max approxx,n  xsup1nsup  xsup1nsup, is minimized for all codexcode in [1,2supnsup. For ease of exposition, we can restrict to codebinary32code IEEE754 singleprecision numbers. p  pI am aware that in general, there is no closedform solution for minimax approximations, however I am under the impression that closedform solutions do exist for the case of polynomial approximations to algebraic functions like emnemth root. In this case we have piecewise linear approximation.p
