Of course thats just an example, There is a lot of big table has so many references, it always has performance problems here because of that.p  pSo Im trying to do not let it in my result.

I already get all data and cache on the server.

Positive 78160 pI need to add a RowVersion column to all my tables.  I need it for reasons like data warehousing and similar DB only actions.

Positive 78160 pWe have a abstract base class and few derived classes. We are storing the data for all the derived classes in one table which has all NOT NULL columns. The Entity framework is handling type initialization using one of the Entity Framework specific column at the time of binding.  While inserting, the abstract base class is initialized to one of the derived class and hence EF is considering only that derived class properties. Hence while inserting, SQL is complaining that it cannot insert  NULL in the remaining columns.  Is there any way we can modify the insert statement generated by EF We dont want to use triggers here p
Positive 78160 pHere a tricky issue I have with breeze, entity framework and a datetime field.p  pI get an optimistic concurrency exception when saving the entity due to the date field having the current microseconds added to it on entering and on leaving the breeze system.p  pHence entity framework thinks something else has edited the db since its original value is no longer equal to what is in the db as the microseconds value is made up on the spot.
