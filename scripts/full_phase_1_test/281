Positive 281 pI hope you can help me, I have been at this for the last couple of hours and I cant figure it out. I am creating an admin panel for specific users to log into.

Positive 281 pIm trying to make a socket connection that will stay alive so that in event of connection loss. So basically I want to keep the server always open also the client preferably and restart the client after the connection is lost. But if one end shuts down both ends shut down. I simulated this by having both ends on the same computer codelocalhostcode and just clicking the X button. Could this be the source of my problemsp  pAnyway my connection code codem.connectlocalhost, 5000code is in a codeifcode and codetrycode and codewhilecode e.g.p  pcodewhile True     if tryconnection         Error handeling         try             m.connectlocalhost, 5000             init  True             tryconnection  False         except socket.error             init  False             tryconnection  Truecodep  pAnd at the end of my code I just a codem.sendexamplecode when I press a button and if that returns an error the code of trying to connect to codelocalhostcode starts again. And the server is a pretty generic server setup with a codewhilecode loop around the codex.acceptcode. So how do keep them both alive when the connection closes so they can reconnect when it opens again. Or is my code alright and its just by simulating on the same computer is messing with itp
Positive 281 pI want to check the state of the current internet connection of my device. p  pUntil now, I used to try it with strongHttpURLConnectionstrong and emconnectem to the URL a hrefhttpwww.google.com relnofollowhttpwww.google.coma and then handling the result via the response Code.
