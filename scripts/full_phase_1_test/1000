Positive 1000 pI am a QA personnel of a bank in my country. We have a lot of applications with legacy code that are really old and havent been tested with white box process. Here, we also regularly got projects and changes to those code as requested by the business unit.p  pMy team and I are planning to have a unit test for them by using JUnit. We know that it is hard to add test scripts for them, so what we want to do is to add the unit test for the new projectchanges first.p  pBut then, after a brief discussion with the developer team, they are unsure of the idea. So, I need your opinion and advice for this project.p  pThank you very muchp

Negative 1000 pQuick question guys, Ive see a lot of code regarding trycatch blocks and Ive seen it a lot of times, that people use specific Exceptions for stuff. I mean, what kind of reason would you have to do that I usually just put an Exception e inside the catch block and just read it out from the Log... is it a performance issue or just habitp

Negative 1000 pUsing AS3 and AIR 14. I have a function save that saves a username after user login and a function get that gets the username every time the App is restarted so the user doesnt have to log back in and can work offline. This works on my iPad 2 and 3, but I have another iPad 3 that this does not work on. When the App is fully closed and reopened the username is not held onto. Is it my code or the device p  pAll 3 devices have iOS 7 and stay uptodate. This problem just started a couple weeks ago and had been working fine on all devices.p  pExamplep  precodepublic var saveDataPersistenceManager  new PersistenceManager  public function savevoid    saveData.setPropertyusername, txtUsername.text   saveData.save   public function getvoid      var usernameString  null    ifsaveData.getPropertyusername         This comes back null on one iPad but not the others   username  saveData.getPropertyusername.toString     codepre
