Positive 33953 pWe have SQL Server 2012 and VS2010 Pro installed which we use for SSISRSAS jobs. I have installed Vs2013 Pro alongside this as we need to use it for MVC 5 development. Everything is working fine. I cannot create any new SSIS jobs in VS2013 and any existing jobs automatically open in VS2010.  However our DBA has found out we have installed VS2013 and is concerned it will have overwritten some SQL server components and wants us to uninstall it and stick to older version. I can find no problems using both of them. p  pIs it fine to be able to use them both He asked if I selected install SQL Server components when I installed it but I honestly dont remember. I used defaults. He was concerned if we tried to open old SSIS jobs in VS2013 it would try and upgrade them but it doesnt even let me, it just says incompatible.  I need to convince him there are no issues with having them bothif this is the case. MAny thanksp

Negative 33953 pI have a EntityAttributeValue table that contains lots of records billions. The problem is, with such a large table, it becomes increasingly hard to pull queries quickly and the way that the data is inserted is VERY poor by design. The reason why is because theres no real primary key. So what ends up happening is, when data needs to get inserted, a delete is performed for that date range and all the new data is reinserted there is no way to remedy this. The reason why an EAV is being used is because its pulling data from other tables with an unknown number of columns through an API.p  pThe alternative that I was fumbling around with was splitting the data up into specific tables. So for every table that gets pulled in from the API, Id create the table on the fly based on the columns returned and insert the data. Id still have to do the delete and insert thing, but at least its on a much smaller set of data. The problem with this is comparison with other tables, wed have to build a union every time the client wanted to pull a new report based on newdifferent tables and the fact that there would be hundreds of tables, maybe even thousands over time. p  pWhat would be the best structure to store data for an unknown number of columns from an unknown number of tables Am I stuck with using the EAV or is there a better way out Please remember that all this data is coming from an API, so theres no way to mirror the data back, my app just has to sit there and pull data back slowly and painfully.p

Negative 33953 pI have usb char device which I managed to bind to devdevice0 with usb skeleton 2.2 driver only with few comments to understand it.

I was able to find, that the number of reads is random, usually 36 and then the program waits maybe waiting for data from device, but Im not sure with this, during last read function waiteventinterruptible in drivers read function returns 512 and meanwhile the callback function of penultimate read isnt called. Why is this happening and how do I find out whether there are any data the device sentp
