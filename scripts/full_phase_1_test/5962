Positive 5962 pThis is the story.p  pI have two computers, one is in my home, another is in my office. Both computers have installed Eclipse and connect to the same project of my github account wtih Egit. I find that when I commit on my home computer, my commit will be recorded and display on my contribution graph. However, when I commit on my office computer, commits will not be recorded.p  pTo solve this problem, I delete projects both on my home computer and office computer, and create new project by cloning corresponding project on github.com with identical steps. Furthermore, I use the same eclipse version, they are the newest Mars. However, the problem still remains, commits on home computer will be recorded, and the other will not.p  pI searched the Internet and can not find the answer.

Negative 5962 pI need to build a highly scalable system to capture click traffic. I want the data to be processed asynchronously so the HTTP click request can return quickly. The click traffic needs to make its way to a datastore for reporting, but it doesnt need to be realtime. I want to be able to scale this solution by adding app servers, as many as needed to meet demand, fronted by a load balancer probably Amazons elastic load balancer. Ive thought of a few possibilities BTW the platform is Javap  ol lipWrite click data to a memory queue e.g. BlockingQueue. Another thread would drain the queue and insert into the backend datastore. This approach limits the queue size to available memory and if the node crashes all data on the queue is lost. I searched for a BlockingQueue implementation that overflows to disk when the queue reaches a certain size but didnt find anything.pli lipWrite click data to the filesystem on each node, with files of 100MB or so. The data would then be collected by a backend process and inserted into a datastore. With this approach there is no single point of failure and low chance of data loss. For example, if a node experiences errors it will be removed from the load balancer. If the backend datastore becomes unavailable, it can resume transferring data files when its available again. Getting the data into the backend datastore would take some time but as long as all the data gets there, its acceptable.pli lipUse a messaging system, e.g. activemq or rabbitmq. A messaging system would introduce a single point of failure, unless installed on each node, which seems like overkill. A messaging system would provide durable messages and some guarantees that the messages are consumed exactly once, with transactions. A consumer of the queue would load the data into the datastore. The messaging system could be clustered in the backend but would need to server napp servers and it could become the limiting factor in the system, affecting the http request performance.pli ol
