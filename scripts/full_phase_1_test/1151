Negative 1151 pIm working on a simple game engine in Javascript crazy, I know. Screenshot from Opera a hrefhttpimg406.imageshack.usimg4065818gamek.jpg relnofollowhttpimg406.imageshack.usimg4065818gamek.jpga Although it looks like a tile engine, its actually objectbased each row or column of grey blocks is a single ltdiv, positioned relative to the viewing area box with red border. The viewing area has overflow hidden, so the objects dont show outside it.p  pHowever, Opera is still adding these objects full heights to the total page height, even though most of it is clipped. Its curious because no scrollbar shows, and the blue outline around the lthtml element doesnt move downward nor if I put it on the ltbody element. But when I press the down arrow, the page scrolls down, until the bottom of those objects would be on the screen, even though theyre clipped. I can tell this is the case because removing those objects solves the problem, and as I move south in the game, the page scrolls back up, since the objects are moving back up and thus reducing the page height.p  pIm using Opera 10, but had the same problem with 9. Firefox handles it just fine. How would I either solve or work around this problem No CSS trickery I can think of has done it, and calling scroll0,0 every frame is even worse  the page jumps to the bottom, then back to the top.p

Negative 1151 pI have a largish 100 array of smallish documents maybe 10 fields each to insert in MongoDB.  But many of them perhaps all, but typically 80 or so of them will already exist in the DB.  The documents represent upcoming events over the next few months, and Im updating the database every couple of days.  So most of the events are already in there.p  pAnybody know or want to guess if it would be more efficient top  ol liDo the bulk update but with continueOnError  true, e.g.li ol  pcodedb.collection.insertmyArray, continueOnError true, callbackcodep  ol lipdo individual inserts, checking first if the ID existspli lipFirst do a big remove something like codedb.collection.deleteid in  [array of all the IDs in my new documents] code, then a bulk insertpli ol  pIll probably do 1 as that is the simplest, and I dont think that 100 documents is all that large so it may not matter, but if there were 10,000 documents  Im doing this in JavaScript with the node.js driver if that matters.  My background is in Java where exceptions are time consuming and thats the main reason Im asking  will the continueOnError option be time consumingp  pADDED I dont think upsert makes sense.  That is for updating an individual document.  In my case, the individual document, representing an upcoming event, is not changing.  well, maybe it is, thats another issue  p  pWhats happening is that a few new documents will be added.p
Negative 1151 pI have a class in which Im trying to create a 2D array with a starting value of 0 in every space class1. I want that array to be able to be called in another class class2, edit the values and then be stored back in the original class class1 that it was created in to be called in another class class3 with the values that were changed from the second class.p  pI know there must be some way to do this but if its too complicated or not an efficient way I can find another way do what Im trying to accomplish. If you can give me an example that would be great.p  pRight now I have a small class with.p  precodepublic class Inventory       public static int[][] inventory1           0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,          0, 0, 0, 0, 0,         0, 0, 0, 0, 0,       codepre  pIm using this temporarily as a placeholder for the array, but as expected it resets the contents to the original array when called from another class, or if a new instance of the second class is run.p  precodeInventory inventorynew  new Inventory inventorynew.inventory1 [0][0]  1 codepre  pWhat Im actually doing is creating and inventory system and depending on what the value is in each place, it will determine what is in the inventory. p
Negative 1151 pIn the merge algorithm, why is the number of comparisons is at most N, and at least N2. I thought the comparison is at most N2, since there would be at most calls on lessaux[j], aux[i]. Or does that mean the comparison include the statements of  ifi  mid and else if j  hi  Thanksp  precodepublic static void mergeComparable[] a, int lo, int mid, int hi        for int k  lo k lt hi k          aux[k]  a[k]      for int k  lo k lt hi k      ifi gt mid  a[k]  aux[j]     else if j gt hi   a[k]  aux[i]     else if lessaux[j], aux[i] a[k]  aux[j]      else  a[k]  aux[i]  codepre
Negative 1151 pI would like to launch new activity under  instantiateItem Function. What i understand about this function is that it is just allowed to add TextView under this function itself.

Negative 1151 pI was wondering whether or not Ive to call the stmtfreeresult for after Ive stored its result with stmtstoreresult Could I rather just call stmtclose on the endp  pThe reason why Im asking it is because when I call the stmtnumrows Ive to call the stmtstoreresult as said here a hrefhttpwww.php.netmanualenmysqlistmt.numrows.php relnofollowhttpwww.php.netmanualenmysqlistmt.numrows.phpa, but they dont call the stmtfreeresult in their example. However, on the stmtstoreresult they do a hrefhttpwww.php.netmanualenmysqlistmt.storeresult.php relnofollowhttpwww.php.netmanualenmysqlistmt.storeresult.phpa.p
