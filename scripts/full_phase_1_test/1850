If the function is called with a lot different ISO duration strings, the cache will grow over time and never reduce its size.p  pIs there a way to tell V8 that it may clear old entries from the cache object as needed i.e. has grown too large Or at least make it clear it entirely as the need arises Solution may depend on ES67 featuresp  pES6 WeakMaps sound interesting, but they accept objects as keys only. Wrapping a string in an array to make it an object will not work, because doing that again will result in a different object. I would need something like codeSymbolstrcode,  but that returns an identical reference for two identical inputs codeRefstr  Refstrcode.p  pstrongeditstrong Theres actually codeSymbol.forstr  Symbol.forstrcode, but its not accepted as WeakMap key.p  pIm also not sure when entries would actually be garbagecollected in case of a WeakMap  it might be more or less immediately, because there would be no reference to the object right after it was added to the WeakMap. So a double no.p  pUnsetting individual keys would require additional bookkeeping when they were added and some algorithm to determine a sensible TTL.p  pIs it necessary to cache the RegExp results even Is there some builtin cache For literal expressions or if created via constructor only, or bothp

Positive 1850 pMany monitoring tools, like the otherwise phantastic a hrefhttpsgithub.comjavamelodyjavamelodywiki relnofollowJavaMelodya, just monitor the current memory usage. If you want to check for memory leaks or impending out of memory situations, this is not particularily helpful, if you have an application that generates loads of garbage which gets collected immediately. Not perfect, but IMHO much more interesting, would it be to monitor the memory usage immediately after a major garbage collection. If thats high, a crash is looming over you.p  pSo can you find out the memory usage immediately after the last major garbage collection  either from Java code or via JMX I know there are some tools like a hrefhttpsvisualvm.java.net relnofollowVisualVMa which do this which is no option for production use, and it can be written in the garbage collection log, but Im looking for a more straightforward solution than parsing the garbage collection logfile.  To be clear Im looking for something that can easily be used in any application in production, not any expensive tool for debugging.p  pIn case that matters JDK 7 with XXUseConcMarkSweepGC , but I am interested in general answers, too.p
