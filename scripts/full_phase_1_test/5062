Positive 5062 pI have 100 csv files in a folder and have been asked to write a function which will return the number of complete cases for each file a count for all rows which contain 0 NA values. In each file there are 5 columns.p  pI am trying to return a data frame which will show the ID column gives reference to the file and the calculated Nobs column gives the number of complete cases in each csv file. I want to be able to do this for different files, specified in the function eg files 13, 7892 etc. p  pI am able to get the correct figure for number of complete cases and the corresponding ID number, but when I paste by function the column headers ID and Nobs are repeated after each line please see below.

Positive 5062 pEarlier I asked for help in including an external library called Eigen in xcode 4. I finally managed to get it to include the header file I wanted to use, Array, by going to build phases, link binary with libraries, and then adding the subfolder within the Eigen archive where Array.h was located, Core. I also added the filepath to Cores parent directory, src, in header search paths. p  pWhen I finally managed to add the line of code codeinclude ltCoreArray.hgtcode without it getting highlighted as an error, I ran the application which worked previously and XCode said that the build failed, with the error messages citing semantic issues. I checked the error message and they include, Uknown identifier Array in a file named Array.h. p  pAll of the header files are in src and according to the Eigen website, they are all thats needed to use Eigen with c. Ive attempted to reformat the binary links so they go to src instead of Core, and adjusting the buildpath to lead to the parent directory of src, ensuring that all header files can now be accessed, but Im still getting semantics issues. Does anyone have a solution to this p
