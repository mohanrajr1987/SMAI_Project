Positive 219 pI have a legacy database system I cannot change which stores very simply hashed passwords.  Its not a megasensitive system so Im not too concerned about the worlds greatest security system, however...p  pI have a clientside modal login window that accepts username and password then calls a Web Api method to authenticate against the database. In the serverside code, it uses MD5 to hash the password and uses that to match the userpass record on the SQL database.p  pIt all works fine, but Im concerned that the developer tools in chrome show that obviously the XHR request is unencrypted and it shows, for example, codehttplocalhost50683apimycontrollerLoginusrfredamppassbloggscode.  It could be argued this is fine as the user is on their own machine and is only seeing what they typed in, but when deployed internally this will be on an intranet and sometimes the users share computers so one with sufficient knowledge could look at network tab XHR history and see another users password.p  pAs a simple lowtech workaround, I thought of doing some basic encryption on the client side before sending the credentials, then unencryptingreencrypting them on the server before doing the authentication request but Im not expert, as youll realise wouldnt that mean having to have the encryption salt in plain view on the client side too, therefore rendering it largely pointlessp  pHow do other systems cope with obfuscating the credentials from the client side in this kind of scenario  Am I worrying over nothing here  I just dont like seeing plain text in my XHR historyp

Positive 219 pSo I studied around a bit and found out that the term One Time Password usually seems to refer to timesynced hardware clocks.p  pWe dont have that. We are creating a workflow where staff may sign up a client, who then receives an email with a link to login, valid only once the client will have to supply some additional, weak and simple personal information such as phone number in order to loginp  pSo strictly speaking this is not a OTP, but probably more somethink like a One Time Token. p  pWhat are good strategies for this case My main uncertainty is about if I need to encrypt this token in the DBSo far Ive identifiedp  ul liGenerate a one time token with codeuuid.uuid4code. This is pretty simple and easy. However, no encryption.li liGenerate a one time token and save it encrypted to the DB, then encode it HTML safe and send it with the link.li ul  pI wonder if there is any need to encrypt the token. Generally of course we need to encrypt passwords in the DB. But this token will be sent over HTTP anyways base64 encoded I guess so I dont see the advantage of encrypting it....p

However when I runned the script for a big number of flows, it hangs for a long time sometimes a few hours on the stopClustercl statement. I googled around, but it seems that nobody ever had the same problem before. Does somebody recognizes the problem Or is there another way to close the cluster object. Because after this first parallel session my script has to do another parallel session for other calculations and this parallel session does not start until the stopCluster method has finished.p

Thus, the user needs to login and then go to the logged in state of the PhoneGap application.p  pstrongThe issuestrong When I setup everyauth for facebook I basically have an URL, like domain.comauthfacebook which will redirect to Facebooks login popup.

The issue here is that the server does not act as an authentication middleman.
