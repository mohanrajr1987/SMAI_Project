This updates some data on form1.p  pHowever, now I need form1 to run a formclose event handler from a different form3 that was launched in another part of the program, not form1.p  pHow is this achievable I thought of having a timer run every 10 seconds on form1 for a public flag set by the form3 formclose event, however this isnt the most elegant soution.p

Positive 36252 pIn our geometry edition software, when the user changes some parameters of the geometry for example the size or position of some geometric figure , a list of interesting main points from the geometry should be obtained and shown in a table. Because obtaining these points can last some seconds sometimes, we decided to use BackGroundWorkers.p  pThe first problem I found was that I had to control when these points were asked to be calculated because I just wanted to show the ones belonging to the last change in the geometry and not the last ones to be calculated in the BackGroundWorkers. I solved the issue by adding 2 DateTime variables one saves the time when the actual shown points where queued to be calculated and other controls when the actual calculation in the actual thread was sent. When the calculation is done I compare the two dates and overwrite the actual list of points if it is newer.
