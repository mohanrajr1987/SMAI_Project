I think this method could work if someone could let me know what I am missing as far as how boolean methods work with more than just the one return type.

Is this route even possible Am I missing some logic in how boolean methods work or something Please understand my frustration and my need for yalls help. thanks for the guidance given...p
Positive 1024 pIm using a ViewPager element in my layout file.

Positive 1024 pIm having some trouble trying to figure out how to do this if its even possible.p  pI have an app which uses parse.com to store its data, the thing is I want each user to have a different parse.com account so their data sets dont intersect whatsoever.

Positive 1024 pI have an IIS application that has a longlived singleton.  On rare occasion, this singleton hangs when trying to obtain a resource. It is known that recycling the application pool will cause the resource to became available again. Assuming this rare event can be trapped by the application itself using a codeStopWatchcode or similar, upon doing so, can the emevent handlerem in the application itself recycle the application pool This is a severe thing to do, but it is better than letting it hang until the next IIS scheduled recycling. The cause of the hang is related to that resource and its interaction with IIS, and I have no means to fix that. Note the call to get the resource is synchronous. If so, please provide information about how to do so.p  pstrongResponse to commentsstrong Regarding a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma5651141553593Restarting the Application Domain and Recycling the Application Poola my observations are that emrestartingem the Application Domain is one of the causes of the hang.

But for now, I have been manually, not programmatically, recycling the application pool to restore operations.p  pUpon Recycling the Application Pool, the Destructor of the Singleton is called, and therein the resource, after a call to the external API, Dispose, is put into a good state, presumably unloaded, but I have yet verify that.p
