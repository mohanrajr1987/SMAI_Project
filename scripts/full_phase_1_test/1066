Positive 1066 pWeve updated our buildserver Atlassian Bamboo to Java 8 JDK. Since then our integrationtests are failing because our started product does not open any port.p  pWe are building with maven and as part of the integrationtest we are starting our builded product. Our product is a RestApi based in an OSGI equinox and Jetty.p  pI tried a lot of things, but nothing helped me to get the product start properly in the maven build.p  pWhen I log in on my remote machine and start the product manually everything works fine.p  pSome more information Our buildserver runs as a windows service and our product is written in plain Java.p
Positive 1066 pHaving read about these concepts, I wonder whether the authors by production mean really the customers environment.p  pI mean, I would expected that Continuous Integration and Deployment analyzes the code, runs the unit tests, builds the product and delivers it to our System Integration Testing environment. Or in general, I would expect that CICD assembles the build for QAQC, i.e. manual or automated tests driven by test engineers.p

Positive 1066 pI have a CI build server that builds every time a push occurs on any branch in the remote repository. As far as versioning is concerned, one interesting idea Ive heard about is using codegit describecode to hunt down a tag that will be used to feed a version number into the build itself.p  pHowever, this has a bit of a chicken and egg problem.p  pTags traditionally are only created on the commit verified as a release. It doesnt exist until that build is created, verified by QA and automated testing, etc. But by that point, emthe build has already happenedem, so I cant use the tag as metadata for versioning the binaries in the build.p  pPeople have mentioned creating the tag at the emstartem of a release, but this seems counterintuitive. When I search for what happened between two releases, Im looking at the tags expecting them to represent the end of a release, as far as the log graph is concerned.p  pCan someone explain the implementation of this How do you solve this chicken and egg problem As it stands, using codegit describecode to version builds sounds unintuitive compared to, say, a text file checked into version control that always represents the number of the emnextem release enabling adhoc development builds in between releases to properly reference the emfutureem release, which is ideal.p
