Positive 7430 pI used an ArrayList of 10 elements in my code. I have to search it repeatedly over the time my code runs. Its an ArrayList of objects and I have to access and modify various aspects of that object. In theory, I am suppose to search it once in a cycle. While implementing I end up searching 5 times a cycle. How can I reduce it I thought of hashing but hashing does not provide much freedom playing with the object elements.p
Positive 7430 pLearning Java as I go Python background.  Simple word count program in Java 7 code can not use J8.p  pI have a hash map of wordcount pairs.  Now I need to sort on count decreasing order, and break ties with using word in alphabetical order.p  pHave read so and I tried a treemap but it does not seem to handle ties very well so I dont think that is right.p  pI have seen a lot of solutions posted that define a new class sortbyvalue and define a comparator.
