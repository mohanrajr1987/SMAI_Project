Positive 8488 pIve been trying to scrape a HTML table with Python and I cant get it to print for some reason,bare with me since Ive just started using Python 2 days in. and Ive barely scratched the surface, this is also my first StackOverflow post so Ill try to make it as descriptive as possible.p  pPretty sure this question mightve been asked before, and Im sorry in that case.p  pAnyways Heres the code p  precodeimport urllibs2 from bs4 import BeautifulSoup soup  BeautifulSoupurllib2.urlopen httppremierleague.comengbmatchdayleaguetable.html.read for row in souptable,classleagueTable[0].tbodytr tdsrowtd codepre  pa hrefhttppremierleague.comengbmatchdayleaguetable.html relnofollowhttppremierleague.comengbmatchdayleaguetable.htmlap  pSo yeah, as I mentioned, Im shit at Python and Im not sure the code is right for this type of scrape, but from what I can understand myself its the print I cant get to work. I tried different ways of printing but cant get it to work.p  pNot sure what else I can include, thanks in advance for any reply I can getp

Positive 8488 pSo after struggling to get the bs4 code to compile, I stumbled on a forum that had a repository to that fixed the problems that Id been experiencing. Mainly that the code was for Python 2 and not 3.p  pI saw on a different forum how to download packages in general. I always thought that there was a method that allowed me to have my code anywhere in my directory and compile it even with my packages not in the same folder. Thats where I learned about sitepackages. p  pCorrect me if Im wrong. But sitepackages is a place where all downloaded packages are stored. So if I downloaded a package bs4 from the Internet. I would cd to the downloads directory and to the bs4 folder. Then inside the folder I would make sure there is a setup.py. p  pWith the setup.py there, then I would type codesetup.py installcode at which point it would download and store this package to sitepackages. Knowing this finally, I have more faith in running my scripts anywhere and now I can worry about syntax errors rather than import errors. Still working on some attribute errors.p  pThat was my aha momentp

Negative 8488 pI am creating an RSpec test to verify data retrieved from a webpage. I call the URL to the webpage and then verify that the data returned is correct. However, part of the test involves resetting the backend, thus, there is a short amount of time during which the server is unreachable. I would like to have an RSpec test that expects the data returned to be the expected contents. However, I get a connection refused exception during the small time the server is resetting and this exception causes the entire test to fail. I would like to somehow perform an RSpec expect and ignore all exceptions that are thrown. For example pseudocodep  precodeThread.newreset server code waituntilexpectretrieve server url data code.to eqexpected data.and ignore all exceptions codepre  pThere is a specifc state the server will be in during the reset cycle, and because of this, I start a thread and wait for the expected data to be returned during that state. This is why I do not wait for the reset to complete and then hit the URL. Any thoughts on how to perform an expect on something and ignore all exceptions would be great. I do not use .to raiseerror because due to timing issues I am unsure as to how many times I will receive the exception during my waituntil note, this is a wrapper to perform the code until the expectation is achieved. I would emideallyem like to just wait until the data returned is correct and ignore all exceptions during the process.p
