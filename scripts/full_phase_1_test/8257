Positive 8257 pI have a question about using streams with files. I know that if I need to do my own file type then the best option is to writeread in binary using for example BufferedInputOuput streams. I have always been considering the best performance in my program so now I am curious about writingreading strings. I have been using Writer and Reader classes with BufferedReaderWriter streams. I have been asking myself If it worths to writeread strings in binary format.  I think there might be some performance boost but is this boost noteworthyp  pThank you for your answers.  p
Positive 8257 pI have a Java server that will have two difference types of clients, a Java based console, and a Lua based client that the server will be controlling. I have got the Lua client to talk back and forth withp  precodeout  new PrintWritersocket.getOutputStream, true in  new BufferedReadernew InputStreamReadersocket.getInputStream codepre  pI am now trying to get a Java based client to connect and I would like to usep  precodeout  new ObjectOutputStreamnew BufferedOutputStreamsocket.getOutputStream in  new ObjectInputStreamnew BufferedInputStreamsocket.getInputStream codepre  pThe problem I am having is understanding the best way to go about accepting connections, not knowing if it is a Lua or Java client on the other end. Then setting up the proper streams. p  pShould I just use different ports on the initial connection I was hoping something more along the lines of sending a string from ObjectOutputStream that BufferedReader could read. Or should I use something lower level to see what is connecting before setting up if it is PrintWriter or ObjectOutputStream.p  pA link to an in depth tutorial or actual code would work. I am having trouble finding resources beyond the basic setup of one or the other.p  pThanks in advanced. p

Negative 8257 pI created a library that extends off of another library written in C, and now Im porting this library over to Java the original library that the C was written on top of already exists in Java. In the C code there is a purely virtual class called codeStallablecode that is supposed to be used in order to add stall detection to a motor controller given a delta in voltage input. The class contains a purely virtual method codegetVoltagecode which is used to supply a voltage source as theyre several different motor controller classes, and some virtual functions to determine if there is a stall.p  pClasses would subclass this class, as well as a class from the original library one that I do not have access to the code and for all intents and purposes otherwise cant modify, and would implement codegetVoltagecode, and override any other methods that they might like. Then these objects can just be asked if there is a stall.p  pWhen I approach this problem from the Java side of things, my situation becomes a bit more tricky. I still can not touch the original class so refactoring the code is not an option, and users of my library should still be allowed to subclass or implement codeStallablecode however they see fit. p  pCurrently, the prospectives I see are as follows.p  ol liMake codeStallablecode an interface and reimplement the stall detection logic it uses. In order to create the original functionality that the C codebase has Id have to have classes subclass the original library and implement codeStallablecode. This would work but would require the logic in the original purely virtual C codeStallablecode to be reimplemented among any subclasses that Id include, and any subclasses that end users would write.li liMake codeStallablecode an abstract class that holds an object reference to a motor controller class from the original library. This preserves some of the functionality from the C code such that some methods would have to be overridden, and some are optionally overridden, however transparency is lost between this code and the C code. In C, Since every subclass was a codeStallablecode and a derivation off of the original motor controller, it became easy to toss pointers around to the object when the motor controller was needed, and when a codeStallablecode object was needed. In this case, some type of accessor function would have to be implemented that returns a Java reference to the original motor controller that each codeStallablecode subclass would hold on to. Transparency would be lost, but stall detection would easily be added.li ol  pObviously if I could modify the original classes for the various motor controllers this problem could easily be a matter of refactoring C code. p  pAfter researching the disparities between both languages approach to OOP, Im inclined to go with option 2 despite the friction it adds for my end users and the codeStallablecode implementations I plan on including. I was asking if there was any other better ideas or insight before I start writing Stallable.java.p

Negative 8257 pIm trying to use Ajaxplorer as a way to choose a file on the server and publish the file path in a form basically linking the file to a db record. I want the behavior to work like CKFinders popup functionality. I want the user to click a choose file button, Ajaxplorer appears in a new window, the user selects the file, and then the path to that file is sent back to the form and the popup is closed. Im pretty sure that this is possible because the CKEditor plugin for Ajaxplorer seems to do just that.p  pIm new to Ajaxsplorer, so I am just digging in. I was hoping that I could somehow pass a callback method to Ajaxplorer that would populate my field on select. However, it doesnt appear that I can do that based on the docs.p  pThe other option looks like creating a plugin. Im happy to do this, but the documentation is weak and it seems like others would have done this by now.
