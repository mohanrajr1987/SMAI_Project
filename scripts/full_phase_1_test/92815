Positive 92815 pI run in to this problem constantly and I cant figure out what causes it or even how I resolve it.  Usually I just end up clicking around forever and somehow magically it fixes itself.p  pAt the top of a code page in Xcode 5 there is a drop down menu which shows the name of your selected code file. This can be set to show counterparts such as the corresponding .h or .cpp, or it can show superclasses, etc.  Or you can use it to manually navigate to a specific file.p  pI have the issue that when I have a code file selected manually, and I need to navigate to a different code page manually, none of the other code pages are available.p  pSee attached picture.

Negative 92815 pMy friend uses an application through the terminal in Ubuntu. Im not sure of the name of it, its some kind of math program. He opens a terminal, types in the command to start the program and then the terminal prompt changes to a prompt for his program and he can enter commands and it will give him back output.p  pAnyway, he was saying he would like to have an interface to this application on a webpage but he knows very little about web development. So, the way I see it is someone would go to the PHP based website, enter some commands in a form and click submit...then the server would start up this terminal program better yet, have it already running send the commands to it, get whatever output it gives, and send that back to the users browser.p  pSo I am wondering can this be done with PHP Can I interact with some program running in a terminal through PHPp

Negative 92815 pI know I can get this to technically work but Id like to implement the cleanest possible solution.  Heres the situationp  pI have a managed library which wraps an unmanaged Cstyle library.  The Cstyle library functionality Im currently wrapping does some processing involving a list of strings.  The librarys client code can provide a delegate, such that during the list processing, if an invalid scenario is encountered, the library can callback to the client via this delegate and allow them to choose the strategy to use throw an exception, replace the invalid characters, etc.p  pWhat Id ideally like to have is all of the managed C isolated in one function, and then be able to call a separate function which takes only unmanaged parameters so that all of the native C and unmanaged code is isolated at that one point.  Providing the callback mechanism to this unmanaged code is proving to be the sticking point for me.p  precode pragma managed public delegate string InvalidStringFilterint lineNumber, string text ... public IListltResultgt DoListProcessingIListltstringgt listToProcess, InvalidStringFilter filter     Managed code goes here, translate parameters etc.   pragma unmanaged  This should be the only function that actually touches the Clibrary directly stdvectorltNativeResultgt ProcessListstdvectorltchargt list,  callback codepre  pIn this snippet, I want to keep all of the Clibrary access within ProcessList, but during the processing, it will need to do callbacks, and this callback is provided in the form of the InvalidStringFilter delegate which is passed in from some client of my managed library.p
