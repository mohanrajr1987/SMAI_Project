Negative 1283 pWere currently moving the build of our UI projects 3 in total to Grunt. To ease the transition Id like to provide a bat file that will run codenpm installcode for each project, however Id like to know if something went wrong when issuing this command. Its merely sugar coating that Im after, I know npm echoes errors out, but Id like some easier messages for the members on my team that are not familiar with codenpmcode and codenodecode.p  pstrongIs there a way to check whether npm has run into an error and to subsequently halt the bat filestrong For example, if node is not installed, I simply check for codeERRORLEVELcode to be 1. If this is the case, I echo out some instructions and exit the execution. The problem Im having is that codeERRORLEVELcode is not set to 1 when an error occurs during a codenpm installcode.p  pAny help appreciatedp

Negative 1283 pI like the table ui example in the rikulo examples with scrollable columns and rows and the fliud motion with the momentum built in. My question is if you wanted to write a table with scroll panes to support ten thousand rows, how would you suggest doing it I assume the load and rendering under the current demo take a long time. So I think you want have a data cursor system that have a lookahead preload when the scrolling updown the table. I thus if you appearance having infinite rows in the table div, but all you have in the DOM is the number of viewable rows plus one or two for transitioningscrolling. Has anybody tried writing one of these in Rikulop  pThanks.     p
