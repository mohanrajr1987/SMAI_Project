Negative 6605 pId like to configure the Windsor container so that a single, singletonstyle instance can provide two or more services through the container.p  pIve found that using the same type in multiple component declarations XMLbased config will result in an instance of that type being created to provide each components service interface, which is not the behaviour I desire. p  pFor examplep  precodeinterface IA   interface IB   class AB  IA, IB  ...  codepre  pI want the one instance of AB to provide both the IA and IB services. p  pThe specific reason I want to do this is that my concrete DAO implementation extends multiple interfaces.
