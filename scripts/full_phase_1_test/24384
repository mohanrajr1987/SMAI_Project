Positive 24384 pI have a table view laid out between a navigation bar and a tab bar and want to achieve scrolling only for the table view section so in other words, in my iOS Simulator, I would want the two bars to always be seen, and I should be able to scroll my table view between them.p  pHaving tried out various suggestions from SO posts, afraid am still getting something wrong. Can you advise please how do I fix this issue  Ive been struggling with it for the last 1 dayp  pIn the table view controllers viewDidLoad, I use the following code. Earlier, I also tried initializing a scroll view separately but understand that table view is a subclass of scroll view, so ditched that path... p  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]       To remove extra separators from the table view to prevent blank rows from showing.     self.tableView.tableFooterView  [[UIView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectZero]        Scroll view implementation      [[self tableView] setFrameCGRectMake0, self.navigationController.navigationBar.frame.size.height, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height  self.navigationController.navigationBar.frame.size.height  self.tabBarController.tabBar.frame.size.height]     [[self tableView] setContentSizeCGSizeMakeself.view.frame.size.width, 2000]      [self setEdgesForExtendedLayoutUIRectEdgeNone]     self.automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets  YES  codepre  pIn fact, to test this further, I have created a scroll view in a separate tab in this tabbarcontroller app where I only have a navigation bar and a tab bar so far no table view. Its viewDidLoad looks like this  somehow, no luck there as well... the scroll bar starts from the top of the screen rather than from the bottom of the navigation bar and goes till the bottom of the screen rather than till the top of the tab bar. So clearly Im doing something conceptually wrong here... appreciate if you can help out please The numbers put in here are experimental to test this out but Ive ensured that the content size is larger than the scroll view frame...p  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      UIScrollView scrollView  [[UIScrollView alloc] initWithFrameCGRectMake0, 100, self.view.frame.size.width, 300]      [scrollView setContentSizeCGSizeMakeself.view.frame.size.width, 1500]     [self.view addSubviewscrollView]      [self setEdgesForExtendedLayoutUIRectEdgeNone]     self.automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets  NO     [scrollView setScrollEnabledYES]  codepre  pFinally, when I debug my app in the simulator, what is odd is that for the table view tab, the scroll bar does appear momentarily to start from below the navigation bar. But as soon as I touch the track pad to scroll, it disappears and a more prominent scroll bar appears and starts from the top of screen to the bottom of the screen as I mention initially abovep
Positive 24384 pI am displaying a pdf in a UIWebView, the pdf contains a vector image but according to xcode its size is 525398.p  pWhen it is loaded into a web view it is automatically resized so that it can be entirely seen on the screen but it is quite zoomed out as the pdf is wider than it is high and an iphone has the opposite aspect ratio.p  pAnyway the strange thing is when is is very zoomed out like this the zoom scale of the web view is 1.0 at this point and the content size is 414319 iphone 6 screen width  what ever vertical height for the image. p  pWhen i zoom in the content size changes. I expected the content size to never change and when it is initial displayed zoomed out then the zoom scale should be lt 1 but instead it is 1 when this clearly isnt the native content sizep  pThis is a problem as i need to zoom into a particular part of the image depending on what the user has done, what is the best way to do this I  have the coordinate to zoom to when it is diplay at its native 525398 but the content size keeps changing as i am zooming.p
Negative 24384 pIve recently discovered that Awks codev VARVALcode syntax for initializing variables on the command line expands escape sequences in VAL. I previously thought that it was a good way to pass strings into Awk without needing to run an escaping function over them first.p  pFor example, the following scriptp  precodeawk v VARxtx BEGINprintfsn, VAR codepre  pI would expect to printp  precodextx codepre  pbut actually printsp  precodex       x codepre  pAn aside environment variables to pass strings in unmodified instead, this question isnt asking how to get the behaviour I previously expected.p  pHeres what the man page has to say on the matterp  blockquote   pstrongv varvalstrong, strongassign varvalstrong Assign the value val to the variable var, before execution of the program begins.  Such variable values are available to the   BEGIN block of an AWK program.p blockquote  pAnd further downp  blockquote   pstrongString Constantsstrong   String constants in AWK are sequences of characters enclosed between double quotes like value.  Within strings, certain escape   sequences are recognized, as in C.  These arep      p... list of escape seqeuences ...p      pThe escape sequences may also be used inside constant regular expressions e.g., [ tfnrv] matches whitespace characters.p      pIn compatibility mode, the characters represented by octal and hexadecimal escape sequences are treated literally when used in   regular expression constants.  Thus, a52b is equivalent to ab.p blockquote  pThe way I read this, codevalcode in codev varvalcode is strongnotstrong a string constant, and there is no text to indicate that the string constant escaping rules apply.p  pMy questionsp  ol liIs there a more authoritative source for the awk language than the man page, and if so what does it specifyli liWhat does POSIX have to say about this, if anythingli liDo all versions of Awk behave this way, i.e. can I rely on the expansion being done if I actually want itli ol
