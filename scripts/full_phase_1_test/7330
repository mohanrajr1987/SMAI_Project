Negative 7330 pI have conflicts between some of my unit tests. I have a class with a static event, when I run each test one at a time I have no problem, but when I run all tests in a batch, the tests which are firing the event will crash because of the registred listeners which have registred to the event in the previous tests.p  pObviously I dont want the event handlers to be executed when the tested class fires the event, so what is the best solution p  pI know I wouldnt have the problem if the event was not static, but I would prefer not have to redesign this if there is another solution.p  pDetaching all the event listeners before running the test could be a solution, but I think it is impossible to do it from outside of the class which seems normal cause we dont want a client being able to detach all other listeners, and doing it from the inside would means that I have to add a method in the class for the only purpose of the unit tests, which is as bad practice.p  pIs there a way to run the test in an isolation mode that would prevent other previous tests to impact it  Like if it was run in a completely separated process so that I dont get the same reference to the static event  But I still need to be able to executes all tests in batch with a simple clickp  pThanks for your help and ideas p  pFor information I am using Visual Studio 2012 unit test framework.p
