Positive 4747 pI have a .hpp file that contains a main function when a define is present.  This is for testing if you must know.  As such, I need to produce an executable when Im compiling with this testing enabled, but g seems to refuse and will only produce a gch precompiled header file.  Having examined the binary contents of this file, it has a format with the first four bytes gpch and then a version number and is definitely not executable on any platform.p  pMy two attempts to get an executable were the followingp  pcodeg DENABLETESTING stdc11 myheaderfile.hppcodep  pcodeg DENABLETESTING stdc11 o a.out myheaderfile.hppcodep  pThe first produces myheaderfile.hpp.gch and the second produces the exact same output into a.out. As described above, these files are not executable.p  pSo the workaround I am using right now is to include the header file from a special purpose and specially named .cpp file and then to compile that file instead of the header, and that works. I use this workaround in a Makefile, so its fairly painless, and as such Im not interested in further workarounds, but an answer to my actual question or perhaps an authoritative statement that a workaround is unavoidable.p
