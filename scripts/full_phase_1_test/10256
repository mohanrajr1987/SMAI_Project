Negative 10256 pFinal Solution  It looks like I had my routing and controllers a little confused.  I had my routing in a file with my controller module.  I moved my routeProvider into the main module, like in the tutorial example.  My controller and my routeProvider where under the same module.  Maybe that was confusing everything.  So now I have the controller in its own module, and the routeProvider is under the main module.  That seems to have fixed the problem without needing to initialize the search field to force the bindings to update the data.p  pUpdate The solution to showing my data at the time the page loads was to use an strongemolder versionemstrong of angularJs, or use codengInitcode and initialize the search field to a blank space.p  pIm getting JSON data from the firebase website to update a table.  I have a search field that works.  The data will not display in the table until I type something into the search field.  I dont know why the data wont just display in the table as soon as the controller is done getting the data.p  pNote  The link to the backend data is now removed, I dont want to keep that database file there indefinitely.p  pHere is the link to the jsFiddle code a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netBlueprinterqKH2z37 relnofollowLast Version jsFiddleap  pHere is code for the controller.p  precodeuse strict  App Module   Create the module named testApp var testApp  angular.moduletheTestApp, [   ngRoute,   testServices ]  use strict  Services   var testServices  angular.moduletestServices, []  testServices.controllerCommonController,      functionscope, http, route      functionscope, http      access the customInput property using route.current     var dbKey  route.current.customInput     var dbKey  testadb12345     var urlToDb  https  dbKey  .firebaseio.comrows.json     http.geturlToDb.successfunctiondata      scope.UsedItems  data        codepre  pHow do I get the data to display as soon as its loaded p  pUpdate 1 Im assuming that the data is already there, but the event of typing something into the search field triggers the filter, and then the data shows up.  It shows up filtered.p  pUpdate 2 Im reading about codeWatchcode There is constantly and event loop listening for events.  When a key is pressed in the search box, the bindings codenamecode get updated if something has changed.  In this case, the content of the search input field was changed.  So the issue seems to have something to do with when the bindings get updated, not whether the data is getting retrieved.p  pUpdate 3 This version of the code runs.  It loads the data when the page is rendered.  Here is a working example in jsBins.p  pUpdate 4 As of angularJs version 1.2.0 the behavior changes.  Versions 1.0.8, 1.0.7 will instantly display my data when the page loads, 1.2.0 will NOT  I just happened to be using jsBins which uses 1.0.7, and it started working.  Didnt know why until I started comparing the differences.  Hopefully, there is a way to make it work in newer versions.p  pa hrefhttpjsbin.comaraTUyO2edithtml,js,output relnofollowjsBins Working Exampleap

The result should be 1 entity inserted into the note text field where the cursor was and further double click events stop.p  pThe problem is, if someone clicks outside the note  rend text fields without dblclicking an entity TD, then that dblclick event handler is never removed. Only until they double click an entity and have that entity inserted is the dblclick event handler removed.p  pAnother bug is, every time note  rend is given focus, a new event handler is created and attached, so that if I click note  rend several times and then double click an entity, that entity is inserted for each time I originally clicked on note  rend.p  pWhat would be the best way to get this to only fire once and only create a single event handlerp  pMoving the .off outside the .on removes the .on as soon as it is set, never letting the function in .on to run.p  precodefunction , undefined          .fn.getText  function              var elem  this.get0             var posStart  0              ifselectionStart in elem                  if elem.selectionStart gt elem.selectionEnd                      posEnd  elem.selectionStart                     posStart  elem.selectionEnd                  else                      posEnd  elem.selectionEnd                     posStart  elem.selectionStart                                  if posStart  posEnd                      elem.valelem.val.substring0, posStart  elem.val.substringposEnd                                           return posStart              jQuery      document.readyfunction          attributes table tr td.onblur, input, functionevent              var elem  this             entities table.onedblclick, tr, functionevent                  var cursorPos  elem.getText                 var entity  this.childrenfirst.childrenfirst.val                 var beg  elem.val.substring0, cursorPos                 var end  elem.val.substringcursorPos                 elem.valbeg  entity  end                 entities table.offdblclick, tr                             ltdiv idattributesgt   lttablegt     ltformgt       lttrgt         lttdgtltpgtnoteltpgtlttdgt         lttdgtltinput idnote namenote typetext valuenotegtlttdgt       lttrgt     ltformgt     ltformgt       lttrgt         lttdgtltpgtrendltpgtlttdgt         lttdgtltinput idrent namerend typetext valuerendgtlttdgt       lttrgt     ltformgt   lttablegt ltdivgt ltdiv identitiesgt   lttablegt     ltformgt       lttrgt         lttdgtltinput ident1val hiddentrue typetext valueampampltgtlttdgt         lttdgtltinput ident1vis typetext valueltgtlttdgt         lttdgtltinput ident1name typetext valueLess Thangtlttdgt       lttrgt     ltformgt     ltformgt       lttrgt         lttdgtltinput ident2val hiddentrue typetext valueampampgtgtlttdgt         lttdgtltinput ident2vis typetext valuegtgtlttdgt         lttdgtltinput ident2name typetext valueGreater Thangtlttdgt       lttrgt     ltformgt   lttablegt ltdivgt codepre
