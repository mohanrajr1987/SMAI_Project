Positive 245 pstrongEditstrong It looks like we identified the solution to this problem via the comments  which is achieved by getting value of the em.outerHTMLem property.

Negative 245 pI have multiple files, each of which I am searching for a sequence of words.p  pMy regex expression basically searches for a sequence where word1 is followed by word2 followed by word 3 etc.. So the expression looks likep  precodestrings  re.findallword1.word2.word3, f.read, re.DOTALL codepre  pFor files below 20kb, the expression executes pretty well. However, the execution time exponentially increases for files  20 kb and the process completely hangs for files close to 100kb. It appears after having read previous threads that the problem is to do with using . in conjunction with re.DOTALL  leading to catastrophic backtracking. The recommended solution was to provide the input file line by line instead of reading the whole file into a single memory buffer.p  pHowever, my input file is filled with random whitespace and n newline characters. My word sequence is also long and occurs over multiple lines. Therefore, I need to input the whole file together into the regex expression in conjunction with re.DOTALL  otherwise a line by line search will never find my sequence.p  pIs there any way around itp
