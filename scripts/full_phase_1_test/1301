Positive 1301 pIve been trying to get githttpbackend working on IIS 7.5 using the FastCGI module. Ive gotten to the point where IIS starts up githttpbackend in its own process, but then I always get a 500 error from IIS. These errors, even with detailed error messages turned on, really dont tell me anything other than that githttpbackend was the source of the error. IIS Failed request tracing also tells me nothing except that githttpbackend exited unexpectedly.p  pI would like to find out emwhyem it exited unexpectedly. If you run githttpbackend.exe manually on the command line, it prints out an HTTP response saying that there was no REQUESTMETHOD from server see below. Thats expected of course, because since I didnt invoke the command from a web server, there was no web server to set the REQUESTMETHOD environment variable.p  precodeCProgram Files x86Gitlibexecgitcoregtgithttpbackend.exe Status 500 Internal Server Error Expires Fri, 01 Jan 1980 000000 GMT Pragma nocache CacheControl nocache, maxage0, mustrevalidate  fatal No REQUESTMETHOD from server codepre  pBut the point is, when Git has a problem, it prints out a detailed message. If I could see this message when it is being invoked by IIS, I could probably figure out what is going wrong and fix it. But IIS swallows these responses and prints out its own 500 responses they are the detailed pages, not the customer error pages, but still, detailed pages show only IIS specific data apparently, not program output. Are there any CGI Windows developers out there who know how to get IIS to display CGI program output somewhere Logs, exceptions, HTTP responses, I dont really care where as long as I can see the output.p

Positive 1301 pone of the important things to understand how a web platformlanguage works and how to treat it, is to know how it handles Http requestresponse or what is the cycle of handling this.p  pAs i know, in ASP.NET amp IIS the HTTP cycle processed using HttpHandlers and HttpModules and done almost using IIS in IIS7Integrated Mode or done using ASP.NET if IIS6 Classic mode, when request arrived to iis it first should detect what is the appropriate Handler to handle it, then there are a set of events for example StartRequest,Authntication,Authorization,EndRequest the modules that subscribed to this events are excuted in the events order, also there are two types of modules Managed which subscribe to ASP.NET events and Native which subscribe to non ASP.NET events.p  pIn PHP, What is the case, i works a lot with PHP but i dont cover this topic, Is PHP depends on apache in handling Http ReqRes or what, also what is the cycle of handling Http ReqRes on PHPp

Negative 1301 pIm trying to develop a USB board that can connect to the computer as a HID device and talk to a Python application Id write. I want to use Python and I went with a HID device to be driver free.p  pThis seems like a great solution until I ran into lilbusbwin32. After working with it for a bit it looks like I have to create an INF file for my USB device. Ive read that the INF recognizes the USB devices IDs VID and PID. Wouldnt this mean every single device would need to ship with its own INF file basically negating the idea of being driver free with HID in the first placep  pWould Libusbwin32 and PyUsb allow me to create a program to talk to any board as long as they were all the same HID devices just having different product ids If so, do users need to download the INF with my programp  pThis seems to defeat the purpose of going with HID in the first place.p
