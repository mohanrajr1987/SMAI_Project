Positive 854 pAs we all know memory mapping can be an elegant way to access an extremely large mount of data on disk.

Positive 854 pIm trying to pull out comments in a MATLAB file. In MATLAB, comments are denoted with  so the sensible thing would be to search for code.code. However, MATLAB also has functions like sprintf and fprintf which allow something like codesprintfx  d, 5code and that regex would find coded, 5code as well, which I dont want. Of course Id also want to ignore variations such as codescode or codefcode. Is there a way to capture only those segments that match code.code but which are not enclosed in codecode characters I suppose I should clarify that Im generally trying to capture comments starting with codecode, but ignoring any codecode within string literals. The sprintf was simply an example of such an occurence that I want to ignore.p  pI found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions17359425howtoremovetrailingcommentsviaregexpthis questiona, which seems related, but no solutions posted there solve my problem.p

Negative 854 pThis is the first time I have asked a question on stackoverflow so I hope I am doing it correctly.p  pSO, jumping right inp  pI have created a template excel file that consists of 4 sheets. The latter three sheets run a bunch of analysis on the data in the first sheet. I have thousands of CSV files identical layout but different data that I need to import into the first sheet. Currently I am opening both files, copying the data from the csv file into the first sheet of the Excel file, and saving it as a unique name i.e. 1.xlsx, then 2.xlsx, etc. one for every csv file. Essentially each unique csv file manually becomes the first sheet in the excel workbook, while sheets 2, 3 and 4 remain the same. Unfortunately it is not practical to repeat this process thousands of times so Im here to ask if anyone has any advice or help on how I could automate this process, whether its within excel or using some python scripting or other method. I am open to anything Thanks in advance.p
Negative 854 pI have a weird problem. The program below is supposed to checks users input and echoes it on the screen, unless the input is some kind of commands I have defined in if statements like the h or r or x.  IF statement will treat the string as a single item and not as several separate strings. So when I input something with a delimiter like Comma , Semicolon  Equals   Space   Tab        Quote  it will search for a second item, thus throws an error and exits. Thats my problem. Please test this program if you cant understand me. I want somehow to make checks for those commands first, before the input is echoed. Please enlighten me  Thanks.p  precodeecho off  again set p input gt   if i inputh  cls echo h echo r echo x goto again   if i inputr  cls type blablafile.txt goto again   if i inputx  exit   echo input goto again codepre

Negative 854 pFor a project Im developing that needs to send short data from one node to another across the Internet, without having to setup email complexities on both ends,p  pDoes anyone know of a pastebinpastie type open service that allows updating ones old paste therefore supporting static URLs for sake of using as a dropbox for short infop  pOr allowing a parameter to set to a prefered URL if availablep  pTrying to implement a simple message passing bridge between smartphones and a program running on a server somewhere, that will be otherwise completely disconnected.  Therefore it would be great if the service also included some kind of agetimestamp like in HTTP headers of when the post originated, but thats optional.p

Negative 854 pIve a IE Explorer bar Band object with lots of UI and communication to server which I would like to implement in C .NET. I also have a BHO with all kind of DOM manipulation and events which I would like to implement in C using ATL. What should be the best way to communicate between these two components. Given that a single process can have several of those Explorer Bar and BHO strongemper tabemstrong, the pairing has to somehow facilitate IE.p

Negative 854 pI have a C program that acts as a watchdog over others. If it detects that a process is no longer running, it restarts it via codesystemcode. The problem is, if I kill the watchdog process, any processes it has started up also die. p  precodevoid ProcessWatchdogworkervoid arg      Check if process is running     if processRunning          systemprocessName pathtoprocessConfig.xml amp  codepre  pThe new child process gets started correctly, and runs without any  problems. But when the parent now this codeProcessWatchdogcode process dies, the child dies too. How can I spawn a child process that is fully independent from the parent p  pIve tried using codepclosecode and codepopencode, running shell scripts that start processes, and a few other tactics, but to no avail. Im ignoring codeSIGHUPcode signals in the child processes, but they still die. p  pSo ideally, Id like to tell the system to start a process that is wholly independent from the parent. I want the childs codetracecode to end with the child, and for itthe system to have no idea that codeProcessWatchdogcode started it in the first place. p  pIs there a way I can do thisp  pIm writing this in C, on Linux.p
