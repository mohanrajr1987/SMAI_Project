Negative 370 pI need to build an application that will use the inputter authorizer terminology, where the user input or edit the model however the change will not be avaliable for others until it gets approved or rejected. The approval or rejection might come from a ticket or request. I am struggling with the best avaliable design for me. p  pstrongMethod 1strong p  pA model like a student model p  precodeStudets Table      stdid,     stdfirstname,     stdlastname,     show True or False    Requests Table      requestid     status Pending, Approved, Rejected,     model might be Student,     modelid to know which model needs to be authorized     typeofchange Create or Update or Delete     createdby the user who created or updated the object     createdat     reviewedby the user who took the action     reviewedat  codepre  pFor this design its ok, however in codeUpdatecode there should be a way to get back to old values upon rejection. so I will add a temporary table which should be same as student table.  p  precodeStudetsTemp Table      stdid,     stdfirstname,     stdlastname,     show True or False  codepre  pand I will add the ID of the temporary object in the request table above in order to apply the new values to the real object upon approval. p  pProblems with this method is that each object in the database should be written twice. Any update on the database scehma should be updated twice. Finally, it takes long time in implementation. p  pstrongMethod 2strong p  pIs to create a file with ID and link the real object with it. p  precodeFile Table     fileid   Studets Table      stdid,     FILEid ltlt this will be linked to the requested file.      stdfirstname,     stdlastname,     show True or False   Requests Table      requestid     status Pending, Approved, Rejected,     model might be Student,     modelidnew     modelidold     typeofchange Create or Update or Delete     createdby the user who created or updated the object     createdat     reviewedby the user who took the action     reviewedat  codepre  pUpon approval or Rejection just switch the IDs in the table. and let the old one to be as an archived one. p  pProblems p  pThere is no accurate ID of the student in the database since we must access the student through the file number not the student number.p  pstrongMethod 3strongp  pTo use a reversion app along with the application and apply the changes and LOCK the model ,, howerver when a rejection comes up then rollback to the old version. When an approval comes up just unlock the model. p  pThis seems to be the best so far, however it needs a seperate reversion application to be installed along with the software. p  pWhat are the methods that you suggest in order to control creating, updating, deleting models through the system. I see multiple apps that uses things similar to this and some uses a full workflow in order to apply the change, which makes me wonder how they implement it.  p
