Positive 58338 pI am looking to start a website project. One of the basic functions I need is for users to be able to add pins to picture in a similar way to how pins are added in the Xcode Map View clicking and holding or also similar to Google Maps. The picture they will be pinning will be an image the user themselves has submitted and from these pins will be links to other pictures they have submitted. The use of Google Maps or any other mapping program would be over kill. It is just the basic pinning action on a picture list item I need. I am trying to research this but the only way I know how to phrase it is in regards to a map so I am getting the inevitable search results. The Facebook tagging function would also serve the purpose. My aspirations for this project exceed my knowledge so any advice would be much appreciated.p
