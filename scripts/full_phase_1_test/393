Positive 393 pRecently I bought a Generic MP3 Player from Amazon a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclickB00EZOK8B8 relnofollowhttpwww.amazon.comGenericScreenMediaVideoPlayersdpB00EZOK8B8refsr11ieUTF8ampqid1441656806ampsr81ampkeywordsgenericipodamppebp1441656809917ampperid0RA8EP89497J1JD8077Ha and it says it supports videos. I have tried WMV and ASF formats and it wont load those videos. On top of that it is very difficult to get my computer running Xubuntu to recognize the drive it turns the device on, just wont connect to drive. I have tried multiple cables so it is not the cable. Beyond that, I want to be able to watch videos on this Generic MP3 it even has a menu that says videos and when I load the videos menu it shows empty disk. The MP3 music works fine, the videos wont show up on the device when connected with USB it shows the files. This is very frustrating. I cant get USB to work without extreme effort and ask putting the files on it wont let me play the video. I tried 2 of the supported video formats WMV and ASF. What can I do to fix this First one wouldnt turn on so got a warranty replacement Any advice would be helpful...p

Positive 393 pIve been asked to investigate a 5.1 surround system that uses an iOS device as the primary source iOS 8 is fine.  Some audio files that wed want to playback are 2496 multichannel FLAC similar to DVDA.p  pIve seen various 2 channel DACs for iOS. Ive also found iOS SPDIF output available, but thats also only 2 channels for uncompressed PCM.p  pIve also read up that iOS8 has reasonably broad USB Class Audio 2.0 support.  That seems the most likely candidate for supporting 6 channel PCM over USB using the lightning to USB adapter.  However, I still cant find any examples of folks actually getting uncompressed, 6 channel audio out of any combination of iOS hardware and APIs.p  pAm I chasing a goose here, or is this feasiblep
