Positive 8944 pIn debug I do see the characters properly. Why do Visual Studio and System.Console encodings differ  How to make consoles encoding match VSs one p  pThere are a couple of posts inquiring about a similar problem, but we are lacking a straightforward answer. I am listing below all the alternatives I tried  which did not work.p  pSome posts mention that in order to the console print them correctly, you need to have the Console output encoding properly set  have a font that supports the character set in question. I just could not find an answer if even possible to change the consoles font.p  pstrong1strong.Setting codeConsole.OutputEncodingcode to UTF8 or to p  precodeEncoding.GetEncoding1255 codepre  pIn my case I am dealing with hebrew characters.p  pstrong2strong.Tried printing the result of     p  precodeEncoding.GetEncoding1255.GetStringEncoding.Default.GetBytesmyString codepre  pAgain, in debug the strings do display correctly. And yes, I have not much familiarity with the topic of character encoding, and I am hoping this is not required for something as simple as this, displaying nonascii characters via System.Console.p
Positive 8944 pWhile testing some code I stumbled on the following MySQL errorp  precodeError Code 1267. Illegal mix of collations utf8generalci,IMPLICIT and  utf8mb4generalci,COERCIBLE for operation  codepre  pI was using a WHERE statement on a standard MySQL UTF8 collation column which contained a character using 4 bytes. Unless I misunderstood, while reading, I found the following informationp  ul liMySQLs original UTF8 implementation was incomplete supporting maximum 3 bytesli liThe way to solve this is a new collation called utf8mb4 which by no means a new encoding but only used by MySQL to patch their original mistake.li ul  pOn my end I see no reasons to use the original MySQL UTF8 implementation since its incomplete. So I did a few server side configuration to make sure all defaults were pointing to utf8mb4. Everything seemed fine but now on my application I can use  characters in my form without having to worry about MySQL.p  pMy problem now remains that when I connect with MySQL Workbench, it seems that the encoding is being forced to UTF8. So even if my application works correctly, if I want to run tests directly in MySQL Workbench, I get the Illegal mix of collation error unless I run this fix in Workbench after starting the applicationp  precodeSET NAMES utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4unicodeci codepre  pI found this old question a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6860086mysqlworkbenchcharsetMySQL Workbench charseta where it seemed impossible to overwrite the setting but even after I spent too much time searching for the config, I cannot believe this is still the casep
