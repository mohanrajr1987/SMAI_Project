Positive 261 pSo I have code that creates a sequence of steps in a text file in the temp directory and then executes the shell FTP.  The question I have is, once the shell is launched and is running through the FTP, is it possible to log the FTP results  Like if a file failed to upload or emcant find file nameem etc This way I can be away from the computer while the script is pushing files to the FTP and later look at the log to see what failed and why.p  pThis is my FTP launch commandp  pre classlangvb prettyprintoverridecodeSub executeFTPBatchByVal ftpfileName     Dim wsh As Object     Set wsh  VBA.CreateObjectWScript.Shell     wsh.Run FTP i sCTemp amp ftpfileName amp .txt, 1, True End Sub codepre

But I think there has to be a more efficient way of doing it.p  pEDIT The ONLY thing I will be using this database for is doing these 24 word exact match searches, and it is meant for internal use.

Negative 261 pI have a few classes.

So now Ive put the helper classes in a separate namespace with a forbidding kind of name, but I suspect theres a better way.
