Positive 236 pI need some advice to get an idea about developping programs in C for microcontrollers. I already developed programs in assembly for microcontroller atmega in assembly. I can say that I have some experience, since I developed some drivers for sensors, motors servors, SDcard, and so on.p  pNow I am trying to develop programs in C for microcontrollers. I have some experience in C but only on linuxbasedcomputer PC. When I tried to develop some programs in C for  a special microcontroller, I get confused. I don t know, which approach I should follow when I write code.  When I write code in assembly, I always read the datasheet of microncontrollers. I take care about all registers, so I can use them correctly. But when I use functions in C, I use them without knowing which registers are used by this function.p  pstrongThe first question Q1strongp  pDo I need to understand the content of functions that I may use in my programp  pstrongthe second question Q2strong  p  pwhen I begin to write a program in c for a microcontroller. What are the first steps that I should dop  p1 should I begin with reading the datasheet p  p2 should I firstly look for the methods integrated in libraries of the microcontroller that I can use for my program and begin to write it. When I need something more accurate, then I can take a look on the datasheetp  pI dont want to waste time like I do with assemby. I think that second approach is better then the first one. Any Suggestion from embedded software professionalsp

Positive 236 pIve been asked to implement VPN capabilities in an existing software project on an embedded system, in order to make the device available via network to an external server while avoiding trouble with firewalls no need for encryption, just to make it accessible.p  pUnfortunately, the embedded system is based on a CortexM4 MCU, therefore Linux, which would allow for VPN nearly out of the box, is not an option. All Ive got is an RTOS and a working LwIP stack.p  pIve used VPNs in the past. However, my network knowledge is rather limited concerning implementing VPNs, so Im rather stumped. As I think, Id use the current LwIP instance for building up the tunnel connection, and the application would use a second instance for the actual network communication, while the network interface of the second instance is a virtual one like a tap device on linux, encapsulating its low level data and tranceiving it via the tunnel connection of the first LwIP instance.p  pMaybe this way Id be able to create a custom solution for the problem, but the solution should conform to any standards as the server will be any kind of sophisticated system.p  pSo I wonder if anyone has been confronted with a task like this, and would appreciate any hint what to do, at least a direction where to look at. Thanks in advancep

Positive 236 pI have a handler for SysTick exception which counts ticks and calls other functions f1, f2, f3 whose execution time can be longer than SysTick period. These functions set and clear their active status global variables so if a SysTick exception occurs it can detect an overload and return to interrupted function. p  pI have assigned fixed priority to SysTick exception lets say 16. I want to somehow make possible for SysTick to generate an exception regardless of its prior active status, go to SysTickHandler, increase tick counter and return to interrupted function. p  pOne solution which may be useful is to use BASEPRI. It can be set to priority lower than SysTick so it would enable that exception. Unfortunately, using BASEPRI got me nowhere because nothing happened I set it to max value. BASEPRI value was 0 inside SysTickHandler before I changed it. Should that value be equal to SysTick priority when processor enters handler function Is exception priority loaded automatically in BASEPRI p  pI have also considered for NVIC to have an issue with preempting already active exception but found nothing regarding that in ARM documentation.p  pAlso, return from handler when oveload is detected could set the processor state to thread mode. Lets ignore that for now.p  precodevoid SysTickHandlervoid       ticks     setBASEPRImaxvalue     if f1act  f2act  f3act return     else          f1         f2         f3       codepre  pA simpler example for this problem without return would be to increase tick counter when having an infinite loop inside handler.p  precodevoid SysTickHandlervoid      ticks     setBASEPRImaxvalue     while1  codepre

Negative 236 pSo Im trying to build a mobile and desktop version of a website simultaneously using a MediaWiki engine, if anybody is interested. Since I dont have much experience with mobile device building, I was looking around for some good mobile development practices. In the end, I feel media queries are good for what I need to do, mostly because doublepublishing on separate domains like m.foo.com vs foo.com is not possible for this task.p  pThe shortcoming to CSS media queries, it seems, is the apparent inability for phone users to view the site in desktop format whenever they want to Google or YouTube is a good example of this when accessed using a phone.p  pIs there any way for me to freely toggle between desktop and mobile stylesheets developed with media queries Would using javascript be too bulky for a mobile device to downloadp  pI appreciate any suggestions.
