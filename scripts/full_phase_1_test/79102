Positive 79102 pI am implementing my first application on iOS Parse. In one of the table I have a column called codeAvailableDatecode. This column format is date. I have thousand of rows in this table but I only need those with codeAvailableDatecode greater than current date. However, I need to keep track of old ones too. p  pI thought to increase speed I can create another table with same fields. Every time one of the rows codeAvailableDatecode is greater than current time, I move it to second table. So I reduce number of rows and increase speed.

Negative 79102 pIm developing a python plugin for Rhythmbox  this contains a GtkScrolledWindow with a child which is a GtkIconView. The IconView is fed from a Gtk.TreeModel.p  pIt looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comJJCfd.png altenter image description herep  pCurrently  and somewhat inefficient, every icon is drawn for every row in the treemodel  each icon is a GdkPixbuf from a file.  If you have thousands of rows, it can take quite a while for the whole iconview to be fully updated with every picture icon.p  pWhat I am trying to achieve is to only update the icons that are in the current drawing area  when the user scrolls and releases the scrollbar or navigates via the keyboard, the icons in the new drawing area should be updated with relevant pictures.p  pN.B.  the treemodel would be fully populated at this point  only the icons would not have been loaded.p  pThis is not really my area of expertise  Im looking for pointers for the best approach I should use to achieve the above.p  pSpecifically  which Gtk3 drawingarea signal or signals can be exposed Gtk.ScrolledWindow  Gtk.IconView  to write python code to calculate what icons should be updatedp
