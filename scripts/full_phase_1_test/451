Positive 451 pI have a vector that contains nonnegative doubles. I want to distinguish the cases when an entry is equal to zero and when an entry is greater than zero.p  pIs it numerically safe to just check ifa0.0 or can this cause problems I have no apriori lower bound for the nonzero values, except machine precision. Should I create a helpervector containing integers to mark the zerovalues for safe checkingp  pFor better understanding The entries of the vector are something like weights on a graph, and I figured I dont need the adjacency matrix to keep track of the graph topology.p  pEDIT My question is Can and will 0.0 be exactly represented in doublesp

Negative 451 pI have a list of IDs in an Excel spreadsheet. I have a macro with a loop to go through all these IDs, use each of them putting it in a link as a form parameter to get some data from an Internet Explorer page, and put the data retrieved onto the next column of the sheet. p  pIm using the DoEvents inside a loop while IE is busy and this is causing some data inconsistencies. Like thisp  precodeID   Data 12   John Smith, Likes football 13   George Wilson, Has a dog 14   George Wilson, Has a dog 15   Frank Peterson, Eats a lot codepre  pAs you can see, eventhough the correct ID is sent to IE, somehow it gets the data from the previous loop. All variables are reset to blank or empty for the next loop, the currentRow variable increases appropriately.p  pHere is part of the codep  precodesome code Dim ie As Object Dim peopleData As String Dim currentRow As Integer some code     Set ie  CreateObjectInternetExplorer.Application some code  loop code     With ie         Dont show window         ie.Visible  False         ie.Navigate httpswww.mypage.compage.phpid amp Sheet1.CellscurrentRow, 1          Dont show window         ie.Visible  False          Wait until IE is done loading page         Do While ie.Busy             Application.StatusBar  Downloading information, lease wait...

It made me think that maybe somehow Excel was too quick or something and wrote the data before it actually got it from IE, hence the repetition of previous data. So I made sure all the variables were reset and I decided to change the DoEvents for a wait linep  precodeDo While ie.Busy     Application.StatusBar  Downloading information, lease wait...     Application.Wait DateAdds, 1, Now Loop codepre  pAnd it works without any problem. All that data is consistent. The huge downside is that it obviously takes one second for every row. With 30 rows the macro takes 30 seconds, which I can live with. The problem is I had to run this in a list with 4000 rows and it took over an hour. p  pWhen using the DoEvents it takes around 7 times less than using the Wait, so 10 minutes is a lot better than 1hr10min. But again, the problem is the inconsitency.p  pHas anybody had a similar problemp
