Positive 13613 pSay I have an R package with lots of functions. I want the user to be able to select which functions they import. p  pBasically, I have functions grouped into use cases. Say there are 50 functions from group A, and 30 functions from group B, with groups C, D, and E, etc. I dont want to export all the functions and overload the namespace with 500 functions 95 of which are not needed  in one script I may use functions from group A and B, in another script from group B and D. Can I allow the user to only import subsets of the functions defined in the package I havent been able to figure this out from reading the docs.p  pThe obvious answer is that these should be separate packages but I dont really want to do that, since there is a logical connection between them, they communicate with and use each other, and it would make maintaining them harder.p  pThe poor mans way that I currently use is that each group of functions is in a separate file, and then I just source the files I need. But Id like this to be in a package properly.p  pAny way to accomplish what I wantp

Negative 13613 pI am rewriting some old ASP applications that were not well structured and trying to learn .NET and MVC3 in the process. There are two main applications, one of which reuses code from the other and is really just a very limited version of the other one. One provided power users with reports on any person in the database. The other one provided a report only on the individual requesting the report. These are on separate servers, the more limited one in a DMZ and the more powerful one behind a second firewall.p  pMy question is, since the actual report is the same for both, just parameterized for the more powerful one to allow it to be run on any user, I do NOT want to copyandpaste reuse the report generation from one side to the other. I would like to make some kind of reusable library of the controller and viewspartials that would provide the same information, and allow me to maintain it all in one place.p  pIs this possible with MVC3 Or is there a better approach I searched here a bit but didnt find anything on this, but maybe I just didnt use the right terms.p  pIm on VS2010, C, MVC3 with Razor.p  pThanks in advance.p

As a matter of fact, I cannot access any site that is hosted by GoDaddy, this includes GoDaddys own blog a hrefhttpsgarage.godaddy.com relnofollowhttpsgarage.godaddy.comap  pBut the thing is, others can access the site and even I can access them when Im using online proxy services.p  pWhenever I try to access the site normally, Im getting the Connection Timed out error. Ive tried accessing my site on my Windows system all three 7, 8.1 and 10, Ubuntu and even on my mobile phone. Im getting the same error.p  pSo, I thought to do TraceRoute on my own domain and the results are as below Ive removed the domain name, domain IP address.p  precodeltpregt CUsersVamsigttracert example.com  Tracing route to example.com [192.169.xxx.xxx] over a maximum of 30 hops    1     3 ms     1 ms     1 ms  dns3 [192.168.0.1]   2     2 ms     2 ms     2 ms  dns1 [15.15.xxx.xxx]   3            56 ms    15 ms  103.245.xxx.xxx   4    11 ms    10 ms    11 ms  103.15.xxx.xxx   5    11 ms    11 ms    12 ms  nsgstatic161.66.72.182.airtel.in [182.72.66.16 1]   6   141 ms   141 ms   183 ms  182.79.245.41   7   162 ms   165 ms   161 ms  80.249.208.26   8   261 ms   259 ms   261 ms  be38.trmc021501.ars.mgmt.phx3.gdg [184.168.0.69 ]   9   259 ms   260 ms   262 ms  be38.trmc021501.ars.mgmt.phx3.gdg [184.168.0.69 ]  10                          Request timed out.  11                          Request timed out.  12                          Request timed out.  13                          Request timed out.  14                          Request timed out.  15                          Request timed out.  16                          Request timed out.  17                          Request timed out.  18                          Request timed out.  19                          Request timed out.  20                          Request timed out.  21                          Request timed out.  22                          Request timed out.  23                          Request timed out.  24                          Request timed out.  25                          Request timed out.  26                          Request timed out.  27                          Request timed out.  28                          Request timed out.  29                          Request timed out.  30                          Request timed out.

When I contacted the GoDaddy customer support, they are telling me that they can access the site and since they cannot replicate the process, it is harder for them to tell whats wrong.p  pNow, all I want to know is, is it a problem with my ISP or is it the problem with the GoDaddy servers the last IP address you see in the traceroute is GoDaddys.p  pHope, you can answer me.p
Negative 13613 pI am a newbie and am trying to setup a blog. I have a question related to a  plugin. I am using super socializer and have enabled it for social commenting on blog. Problem is that if I enable the social commenting the comment box kind of resizes and I cant see post button and need to press tab on keyboard to bring up the button. If I keep the social commenting disabled , the comment box shows up properly. I dont know which part of css needs to be adjusted so comment box comes up in full height so the buttons are visible.p  pThe page is at a hrefhttpwww.myinvestingedge.comp146 relnofollowhttpwww.myinvestingedge.comp146a.  p  pI will really appreciate your help. p
Negative 13613 pIm trying to simulate a black outline to white text on a jquery image sliderAccordion based on a hrefhttpwebargument.com20110307jqueryaccordionimagemenuplugin relnofollowAccordion Image Menua  .  This works great until IE 9 comes into the picture.  Im using Jquery fadeTo to handle opacity.  Originally I was using animate but I have the same trouble with that.  Whenever the text fades in or out Im getting a black box where the span elements are.  The black box seems to quickly appear then disappear with a flash type effect when fadeTo starts and then again when fadeTo finishes. This does not occur with IE 7 or 8.  Looks great there.p  pstrongIn an IEonly stylesheet I havestrongp  precodeaccmenu1 a span.leftarrow  position absolute  left 5px  bottom 0  color FFF  fontsize 3em  marginright 25px   accmenu1 a span  fontfamily Helvetica,sansserif  bottom0  left20px  width100  displayblock  padding2px 5px 5px  positionabsolute  fontsize1.8em  fontweight bold  height25px  lineheight18px  color FFF  filter progidDXImageTransform.Microsoft.DropShadowoffX1,offY1,color000000  filter progidDXImageTransform.Microsoft.Shadowdirection225,strength2,colorblack  codepre  pstrongHTML looks like this...strongp  precode ltdiv idaccmenu1gt       lta hrefgtltspangtLink Nameltspangtltimg titletitle srcimage source alt widthw heighth gtltspan classleftarrowgtamplaquoltspangtltagt       ... 3 more anchor tags ...  ltdivgt codepre  pemLink Nameem is what fades in and out depending on which image is open.p  pstrongHere is the relevant jsstrongp  precode var title  span,this  var arrow  .leftarrow,this   if this.menuSettings.fadeInTitle  null ampamp title.length gt 0                      if itemDim  this.menuSettings.openDim                          if this.menuSettings.fadeInTitle                             title.fadeToslow, 1                             arrow.fadeTofast, 0                          else                              title.fadeToslow, 0                             arrow.fadeTofast, 1                                                else                          if this.menuSettings.fadeInTitle                             title.fadeToslow, 0                             arrow.fadeTofast, 1                          else                              title.fadeToslow, 1                             arrow.fadeTofast, 0                                                                 codepre  pIm doing my best here to accommodate IE, but its getting frustrating.
