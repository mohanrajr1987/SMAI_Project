Positive 194 pI am trying to add query timeouts to my system using JDBC. I am using the statement.setQueryTimeout function to do this. I know that this value is being set on statements I create using connection.createStatement, prepareStatement etc., as I have checked it using statement.getQueryTimeout. However, when testing with different databases mysql, mssql, oracle and db2 and only mysql functions properly and all the others dont actually timeoutp  pAny idea what could cause this I am not sure why things would work at a high level for one setup but not the others, as I am using the standard provided drivers p
