Positive 35 pI am programming an UDP client. I want to bind the socket to a given port on the client machine, so that the same port is always used for all sends.

Positive 35 pWe have a console application built on .Net 4.5 and running on an Azure StandardA2 VM. This application reads data from 3 transactional MSMQ queues that are created on the same server.

Negative 35 pIm porting an app from Win8.1 to Win10 due to scope changes, its a complete rewrite for UAP, and ran into an issue.p  pWe are trying to display a few hundred items, grouped by their creation date year and month in a GridView. On W8.1 it was easy, create a GridView with a CollectionViewSource, set the GroupingStyle, and it would wrap the items so we can scroll vertically.p  pHowever, on W10, for some reason, all defined Panels defy this, and wrap the items horizontally, thus making lists instead of actual horizontally scrollable gridviews. This is not the behavior I want.p  pI tried with VariableSizedWrapGrid, which can do this, but only statically. It needs a MaximumRowsOrColumns value, which if I set, I can achieve wrapping, at a given height. As my items are fixed height the VSWG ItemsHeight and ItemsWidth is set to 90, my items are 1 row 3 column, this results in vertically scrolling gridviews if the window height is less than the amount required to accommodate the items. I would like the items to automatically rearrange themselves so no vertical scrolling happens.p  pIs there a way to achieve the original W8.1 behavior of the Panels in Win10p

Negative 35 pI have hurriedly written this class which takes for initialization the textual representation of graph as a string and constructs a graph object.p  pThe first line header describes the type of the graph and the number of vertices. It has two or three parts. The first part is either the character D indicating a directed graph, or the character U indicating an undirected graph. p  pIf the graph is weighted, the second part of the header is the character W. p  pThe last part of the header is a natural number n indicating the number of vertices in the graph. All the vertices in the graph are numbered from 0 to n1.p  pIf the graph string has more than one line, each remaining line starting from the second line, describes an edge. The first two parts of an edge are two natural numbers between 0 and n1, describing an edge between the two vertices identified with these numbers. p  pIf the graph is directed, the two numbers must be interpreted as an ordered pair describing an edge from the first vertex to the second vertex. If the graph is undirected, the two numbers must be interpreted as an unordered pair describing an edge between the two vertices. p  pIf the graph is weighted there will be a third part which will be an integer indicating the weight of the edge.p  pThe graphs can be both directed or undirected, and weighted or nonweighted For example this graphp  precodegraphstring   D W 3 0 1 7 1 0 2 0 2 0  printGraphgraphstring.adjacencylist  codepre  pis directed and weighted, and the 3 next to these symbolize the number of edges in this case 3. The adjacencylist of this example would outputp  precode[[1, 7, 2, 0], [0, 2], []] codepre  pThe class I have written does achieve this, but not in the way a class is supposed to act. I am a bit confused about how to turn this into a proper class, all I know of now is that it should have onlyp  precodeclass Graph def initself, graphstring     self.directed     true if directed, false if undirected     self.weighted   true if weighted, false otherwise     self.adjacencylist   a list of lists codepre  pas the init, with separate methodsfunctions to achieve the rest.

Negative 35 pIs there a way to create a generic function that can take an object as a parameter and also one of its members.
