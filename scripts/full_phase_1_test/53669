Positive 53669 pThe video is rendered with ffmpeg with the faststart flag added meaning the metadata should be at the start of the file, and the server appears to be handling partial content requests correctly, so why does it need to have downloaded so much of the video before the player becomes enabled and can play the video I am testing it in Google Chrome.p  pOnce the player becomes enabled I can seek around to various points in the video pretty instantly and see the new partial content requests being made.p  pHere is a link to the video sa hrefhttpiptv.la1tv.co.ukunibrass.mp4 relnofollowhttpiptv.la1tv.co.ukunibrass.mp4asp  pHere is a jsbin with the video tag a hrefhttpsjsbin.comrahewidoru relnofollowhttpsjsbin.comrahewidorua .

Negative 53669 pIm trying to use Robocopy as part of my backup procedures, whereby backup files are copied from one disk to another for secondary and tertiary backups. I basically have one key external drive for primary backups, and then various of the backups get siphoned off to other disks, depending on which disk it is. I want to develop a sequence of Robocopy commands in a batch file that I can use in any situation, so that if the Robocopy command tries to copy a folder from the source to a destination drive where there is no matching folder, it automatically FAILS and moves on to the next command. Robocopy by default creates the destination folder if it does not already exist, and I want to switch this default OFF if at all possible. p
