Positive 4126 pI am using TinyMCE in a forum project and have created an custom image upload plugin and associated button  Which works fine and as expected.p  pHowever, the ability to to upload images is based on permissions and changes per category. p  pWhen a user creates a new discussion, at this point I dont know the Category they want to upload to until they select a Category. p  pSo initially I want to show the standard image button plugin, and when they select a Category I will check permissions and if they have permission remove the standard image plugin button and add my custom plugin button.p  pWhen TinyMCE is initialised I am loading both plugins sop  precodeplugins [image forumimageinsert] codepre  pSo they are already loaded, its just a way to add remove buttons on demand Is this possible p  pSurely I cant be the only person who would need this sort of functionality Any help or code examples would be really appreciated.p

Positive 4126 pIm using winforms WebBrowser control to show TinyMCE editor to represent an editor with styles that will produce html. I want to insert inside the TinyMCE Editor data I got from word.

I noticed that when I am copying the data from word and pasting it to TinyMCE editor it converts the data somehow without losing the font, so I tried using interops codeRange.Copycode function and paste it to the TinyMCE editor, but I didnt find a way to call the paste event on the TinyMCE and send it the data on the clipboard the problem is calling the event. p  pHow can I trigger the paste event on the editor im using version 3.1.0.1 of TinyMCE.p  pis there a known better way to do itp
Positive 4126 pWhat is the differencep  precodetinymce.activeEditor.setContentfoo tinymce.activeEditor.setContentfoo, formatraw codepre  pI know the documentation of tinymce.setContentgetContent but it does not explain too much. And i could not any detailed explanations or examples in stackoverflow or google. When should we use one and the other Which drawbacks has each one Can anyone give some more details What I found so far is, i am using TinyMCE embedded in a java application and use it as mail reader and mail editor. When we receive an email written by outlook which contains numbered lists, the HTML of the mail contains emmsoem tags. If we set the content which contains mso tags with default usage, setContentfoo, we can not see the numbered lists elements properly, they are left aligned. And other font problems occur. But if we use setContentfoo, formatraw we can see the document properly. Why this difference occursp

Negative 4126 pFor few months now I have been developing an Android app using codePhoneGap 2.8code and on the javascript side I have used codeBackbonecode and codejQuerycode as my main frameworks. As my application has grown to a reasonable size, I have started to notice a considerable memory consumption. Having read different articles that explain why codePhoneGapcode requires considerable amount of memory even to run, I still believe that I can do some optimization to how i use memory. p  pIn codeBackBonecode we have a Router object that maps URIs to specific functions, which render me something called a codeViewcode object. Not only I implemented my router functions to create a view and render it, but I also store globally reference to currently being displayed view. So before a new view is created, I tell the old view to make some clean up That is done recursively since views can contain more sub views. Under clean up I currently tell view to undelegate his events I trust codeBackbonecode removes the event listeners. Not much more is done currently. Once new view is rendered, global variable will reference the new view. I trust that javascript GC will release the memory, used by the old view. Alas, I dont things this is happening the more I navigate around my app, the more memory is being used up. I am aware that there is some memory leaking going on, but I cant figure out what is it, that takes memory. One thing I suspect is that old objects are not being garbage collected properly for some reason. I suspect that once I render new html DOM over some container, perhaps old codeDOMcode is causing memory leaks, perhaps some event handlers are being unnecessarily stored somewhere.  p  pWhat I would like to know, if there is any tools or commands or tips on how can I debug trace measure where memory is being allocated. Is there a way to access all event listeners and measure them somehow same for DOM. Any article to smart memory efficient techniques would also be appreciated. Currently only thing that I can thing of to do, is to start recursively deleting all attributes of the objects in the end objects as well I am willing to destroy. p  pAny suggestion is very welcome  Thank you in advance. p
