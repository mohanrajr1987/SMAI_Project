Positive 6525 pI have a collection a Java List of tens of thousands of elements and Im writing a Clojure function that needs to split this list into several parts based on predicates.  In the end I have several Clojure collections with only elements matching the predicate associated with the collection.p  pThe following code solves my problem but iterates over the input list 3 times.  Is there a better way to do thisp  precodedefn divideintogroups [col]   let [one filter lt  3 col         two filter and gt  3 lt  6 col         three filter gt  6 col]    [one two three] divideintogroups shuffle range 10 [2 0 1 4 3 5 6 8 7 9] codepre  pIm really looking for a functional Clojure solution.  I already know I could create three collections as vars and mutate them inside the codedivideintogroupscode function and maybe that is the Clojure way.  If so, then please say so.p  pNOTE the predicates I use above are not the ones in my production code.  The data Im working with is also not numbers.  This is just a SSCCE.  The answer to this question must be applicable to the general problem with arbitrary data in the collection and arbitrary predicates. And of course, performant.  To be clear, the lazy lists returned by codefiltercode will all be completely iterated over and used to generate some output.  So I cannot rely on lazy solutions p
Positive 6525 pAccording to the spark DAG vizualization there is a codegroupBycode being performed in Stage 1 after the codegroupBycode being performed in Stage 0.

This library needs to execute some JavaScript. a hrefhttpscarouselapps.com20150911isomorphicclojurescriptjavascriptforprerenderingsinglepageapplicationspart1I tried with Nashorna but I encounter some limitations that might be too hard to overcome. As an alternative, I want to try NodeJS.p  pI want my library to be self contained, to not depend on the system running NodeJS independently and thus requiring a particular deployment mechanism to place the Java and NodeJS artifacts in the right places to be picked up by the two different network servers.
