Positive 2433 pI have a class hierarchy like this codeBeverage gt Coffeegt Lattecode. Where codeBeveragecode is the codeabstractcode superclass being extended by codeCoffeecode. codeCoffeecode class then adds some behavior but is also codeabstractcode. codeLattecode extends codeCoffeecode class and is a concrete class. I have used inheritance to add behaviors here. And inheritance do have drawbacks like the visibility of superclass methods, making code fragile, the code is tightly coupled. So, programming principles dictate codeCompositioncode should be preferred over codeInheritancecode. But in this case codeinheritancecode feels so natural as codeLattecode is a type of codeCoffeecode and codeCoffeecode is a type of codeBeveragecode that using codecompositioncode to add behavior feels wrong in spite of its benefits.
