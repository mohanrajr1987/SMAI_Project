Positive 7397 pSo, me and my teammate are in a situation where our QA team offshore has left a stored procedure running afterhours and went home for the day. Because of the time zone differential, me and my teammate have now seen the job has finished  however, we have no way of seeing whether it was successful or not, because the messages are returned to our QA team members client instead of ours.p  pMy question is this Is there some way that I can retrieve the message results from that stored procedure execution remotely Or will we have to wait until tomorrow to hear back from our QA teamp  pThere is a complication in that the stored procedure in question runs against a linked server that is emnotem a Microsoft SQL server. Therefore I cant go to the linked server and check on previous activity using the tools that SQL Server Management Studio provides. The linked server in question is a Salesforce org, so if anyone has any suggestions regarding finding past query activity in SF, that would also be helpful. However, I have looked myself and wasnt able to find anything relevant there either.p
