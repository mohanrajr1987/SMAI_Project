Positive 10742 pIm creating an app which requires users to be grouped up.  However, within those groups, I need to be able to assign users different levels of permissions.  I would also like users to be able to be a member of multiple groups at the same time, and have different levels of permissions within different groups.p  pFor example, using homework assignments as an examplep  ul liA user for example a grad student teaching a class creates a group.  The grad student then has the highest level of permissions within the group.  They can add assignments, invite students to the group, edit, grade assignments, as well as give other users different permission levels.li lipThe next group permission level group might then be TAs, who would have some of the permissions of the owner, like grading assignments, but not all.pli lipThe lowest would then be the students, who would only have the ability to join a group and submit assignments.pli ul  pHowever, the grad student teaching the class might themselves be in a different group, as a TA, or a student.p  pThe details of the permissions themselves arent that important.  What I came up with as a possible solution is creating a model that contains referencesforeign keys to each permissions group within the main group.  My question is is there a way I can create a foreign key to a permissions group within a django model  If not, is there a different way I could accomplish this same goalp  pAny help would be appreciatedp
