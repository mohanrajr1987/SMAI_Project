Positive 1292 pIm new to programming, and am trying to get a better understanding of pointers specifically. Could a static variable be declared inside a function and then accessed or deferenced from outside the function Why would you not allow explicit pointers to it out of scope, since the memory of the static variable would remain allocated.p
Positive 1292 pThis is my first time asking a question on this forum.  I hope i can be specific enough.  I am trying to replace the front page posts section of a WP template.  I have the code below running fine on my index.php page it gets the posts when the WP theme is set to settingsreadingyour latest posts BUT the way the WP theme the thinker is setup reading is set to static page and the posts are gotten through a blog template page in same location as the index.php file which gets the posts from loops in separately included files.  Id like to keep it set to static for a few reasons.  My question is Is there a reason why the code below would only work in an index.php file and not out of a blogtemplate file which is is in the same location as the index.php file.  Ive checked and the the templateparts called in the code are being called.  It seems like theres just no posts to get which there are.p  pThank you for your time,p  pDavep  precodelt blog content gt     ltdiv classcontainergt         ltdiv classrow idprimarygt             ltmain idcontent classcolsm8 rolemaingt                  ltphp if  haveposts   gt                   ltphp  Start the Loop  gt                 ltphp while  haveposts   thepost gt                      ltphp                          gettemplatepart templatepartscontent, getpostformat                      gt                  ltphp endwhile gt                  ltphp thepostsnavigation gt                   ltphp else  gt                      ltphp gettemplatepart templatepartscontent, none  gt                  ltphp endif gt          ltmaingtlt content gt           lt sidebar gt          ltaside classcolsm4gt             ltphp getsidebar gt         ltasidegt      ltdivgtlt primary gt ltdivgtlt container gt codepre
