Positive 15475 pI have searched around and there have been several questions on this issue, but none of them seem to fit my context. p  pI am working on an algorithm for image segmentation in Python, using the anaconda distribution. In the beginning stages of the algorithm, a weight matrix must be calculated, to give the weights of the edges between every pixel of an image using the pixels as nodes in a weighted graph data structure. Obviously, this results in a matrix of a huge size, codeimageWidth  imageHeight2code. This takes a very long time to build for larger and larger images, so a while back I implemented a couple of functions to build the matrix using all cpus on the machine. p  pThis has worked perfectly fine for me for weeks during testing. However, our algorithm has been steadily improving, and it is now ready to test on some real data gathered from an xray microscope. Our tests have so far been no larger than 64x64, and that took quite a while, so we have moved to a machine with 40 processors.p  pNow that we have moved, I all of the sudden am getting an error at the multiprocessing function p  pcodeSystemError NULL result without error in PyObjectCallcodep  pI dont understand this, because the only difference is the number of cpus. Why should that cause an issue If someone knows more about how pythons multiprocessing package actually works, then maybe you can see something that I dont.p  pHere are the functions in question. The first initiates the process poolp  precodedef CreateMatrixself, sigmaI, sigmaX                                      cpus  mp.cpucount     poolCount  cpus     args  [self, sigmaI, sigmaX, i, for i in rangeself.numPixels]      pool  mp.Poolprocesses  poolCount     tempData  pool.mapunwrapCreateMatrix, args      for pixelList in tempData                                                   for pixel in pixelList             self.data[pixel[1]]  pixel[0]      self.matrix  numpy.matrixself.data.reshapeself.columns, self.rows, numpy.float64     return codepre  pThe second one if called by each process and has nothing to dow ith the creation or handling of the process pool, so I doubt the issue is herep  precodedef CreateMatrixPixelAself, sigmaI1, sigmaX1, i  0                     pixelA  self.pixelArray[i]     pixelAData  []      j  0     for pixelB in self.pixelArray         stride  i  self.numPixels  j          locationDiff  self.CalcLocationVectorNormpixelA, pixelB          if locationDiff lt self.distance             intensityDiff  self.CalcPixelVectorNormpixelA, pixelB                locationDiff  1  powlocationDiff,2             intensityDiff  1  powintensityDiff, 2                              value  math.expintensityDiff  sigmaI  math.explocationDiff  sigmaX             pixelAData.appendvalue, stride          j  1      return pixelAData codepre  pAlso this one, just to spare any confusionp  precodedef unwrapCreateMatrixargs                                                     return WeightMatrix.CreateMatrixPixelAargs codepre  pSorry for the big wall of text.

Positive 15475 pI have found that when importing modules and using multiprocessing at the same time, strange things start to happen. Take for examplep  precode   main.py   import multiprocessing import foo  def bara     foo.test  if name  main     pool  multiprocessing.Pool5     pool.mapbar, [1]  15     foo.py   import api   Note the indirect import.  def test     printapi.a     api.py   printImported a  5 codepre  pFor me this example outputs something likep  precodeImported Imported 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 Imported 5 5 5 5 codepre  pNote that the module codeapicode is being imported i.e. executed multiple times. How could I avoid this I want to run the code inside module codeapicode exactly once like static initialization in C, and I want the resulting states in this case codeapi.acode to be accessible from the other processes  but only initialized once.p  pIn the real use case, I take sensitive input from the user in the codeapicode module and I want to take that user input strongexactly oncestrong. Currently the user has to input his data once per Process executed by the Pool  every time the module is imported.p
Positive 15475 pI feel like I should preface this question with the following statement strongI know that reloading  modules in python is frowned uponstrong.
