Positive 6159 pHello I am having an issue with PyQt when it comes to splitting an string.p  pI am currently grabbing the input text from a TextEdit field and splitting the string inputted into a list. p  precode    starttoken  self.serialInputText.toPlainText     splitstart  starttoken.split      print starttoken  rn     print splitstart codepre  pHowever whenever I print this to see what my new string list is I get the following p  pcodeltPyQt4.QtCore.QStringList object at 0x10b18a488gtcodep  pWhich i believe is the memory address of the StringList. Instead I would like to print the StringList out and view it to make sure it is functioning correctly.p  pI have tried a different approach and imported codeimport sipcode and used codesip.setapiQString, 2code and then when i print my StringList it will appear as the followingp  pcode[uDog, uCat, uBird, uAnimals, uTigers, uEtc]codep  pwhich is fine however its adding a codeucode to every entry in the list.p  pSimply put, I want to have a TextEdit field and text will be inputted into that field. Then that text needs to be separated via a space delimiter to be used for another function later on in the program. p

Negative 6159 pThank you in advance for the help p  pMy situation is this  I have an API that, when the server errors, returns a content of System.Web.Http.HttpError. p  precodevar errorResponse  new ErrorResponseFactoryex, showDebug System.Web.Http.HttpError error  errorResponse.Error return Request.CreateErrorResponseHttpStatusCode.InternalServerError, error codepre  pWhen doing unit testing  calling the API method directly, I can extract the HttpError just fine. However, when calling the API from another server, All I get in return is an Net.Http.StreamContent. I cant seem to pull out the HTTPError for consumption. p  precode var response   client.GetAsyncapiSignature.Result     RETURN INSTANCE OF THE REQUESTED RESOURCE  if response.IsSuccessStatusCode       return response.StatusCode  HttpStatusCode.NoContent       defaultT      response.Content.ReadAsAsyncltTgt.Result       DEAL WITH ERROR CASE   var httpError  GetHttpErrorresponse codepre  pThis will always return a nullp  precode protected HttpError GetHttpErrorHttpResponseMessage message       HttpError err     message.TryGetContentValueout err     return err   codepre  pI have full control over both code basis, so I am not married to the HTTP error, but I do like what it provides and would like to use it if possible. p  pThanks again, p  pMS Visual Studio Web API application, Windows Azure deployment, but testing locallyp  pSteveJp
