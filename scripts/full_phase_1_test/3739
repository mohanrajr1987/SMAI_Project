Positive 3739 pI am planning to build a webapp that will send request to example.com endpointsp  pAccessing example.com may be blocked by the our system admin at the office, so sending request directly using clientside javascript will not work. Am I only left with the option of sending the API request from the clienside js to my servernot blocked and the server will be the one to forward the request to a hrefhttpexample.com relnofollowhttpexample.coma p  pIf yes, this process will burn some time, how can I optimize thisp

Positive 3739 pGood day, dear friends Im searching for advice for implementing Entity Framework in ClientServer Architecture. Now on my Server Side I have 4 projectsp  ol liDomainClasses  Domain Classes with simple and navigation properties and nothing more.li liDataAccess  EF configuration project, including Conventions for all project and Configurations Fluent API for per Domain Class.li liBusinessLogicli liServicesli ol  pMy Client Side application will use almost all the classes from Server Side DomainClasses and their Configurations from DataAccess. Also some of these classes will be extended with additional properties. So now Im questioning about what is the best practice to do it Should I make my DomainClasses and DataAccess common for both sides and add additional properies using iheritance in Client side or I need to have seperate DomainClasses and DataAccess for Client and Server Sidesp  pThanks p

Positive 3739 pI am practicing a clientserver application in C. In the application, the client first registers with the server and gets the codeclientidcode in return. Next time onwards, the client sends the messages to the server prepending the codeclientidcode to the message. Below code snippet is from the server, where after receiving the message, the server retrieves the codeclientidcode from the message, which is a 3 char long string with start address as 1 and end address as 4 from the message array. eg. In the message code1001CLIENT001MESSAGE01code, 1 at location 0 is for some purpose, 001 is the codeclientidcode and codeCLIENT001MESSAGE01code is the message from the client.p  precodechar createdynamicstringint strsize          char dynstring  mallocstrsizesizeofchar         ifdynstring                          printfDynamic string could not be created                 return NULL                  dynstring[0]  0         return dynstring   void freedynamicstringchar dynstring          freedynstring   char message is dynamically allocated char array. char retrieveclientidchar message          char clientid         int i         clientid  createdynamicstringCLIENTIDSIZE  1          ifclientid                          printfClientid is NULL                 return NULL                  fori  1 i lt CLIENTIDSIZE  1 i               clientid[i1]  message[i]          strncpyclientid, message  1, CLIENTIDSIZE          memcpyclientid, message  1, CLIENTIDSIZE          clientid[CLIENTIDSIZE]  0         printfclientid retrieveds, clientid         return clientid  codepre  pThe server accepts a connection from the clients and processes the messages in different threads. The working on multithreading and processing of the messages is tested successfully. Below code compiled successfully and works most of the times. But some times it ends up in segmentation fault at codememcpycode in coderetrieveclientidcode.  I am not able to figure out why is it failing this way. p  pI used codegdbcode to get more info. This is as below.p  precodeProgram terminated with signal 11, Segmentation fault. 0  0x00000000004017ef in retrieveclientid message0x1b904f40 1000CLIENT000MESSAGE02 at srcserver.c46 46              memcpyclientid, message  1, CLIENTIDSIZE gdb print message 1  0x1b904f40 1000CLIENT000MESSAGE02 gdb print message1 2  0x1b904f41 000CLIENT000MESSAGE02 gdb print CLIENTIDSIZE 3  3 gdb print clientid 4  0xffffffffcc0008c0 ltAddress 0xffffffffcc0008c0 out of boundsgt gdb                codepre  pNeed help in understanding what exactly might be happening when the application is failing. I have verified that the codemalloccode was successful and codeclientidcode was not NULL. As you can see the commented code, I also tried with codestrcpycode and also copying the chars from source to dest array one by one. But there also I saw the failures.p
Positive 3739 pIve written a small program with the boost asio library to transfer files via TCP from a server to one or more clients.p  pDuring testing I found out that the transfer is extremely slow, about 10KiBs. Nagles algorithm is already disabled. If I transfer the same file via FileZilla from the same server to the same client, I get about 280KiBs, so obviously something was very wrong.p  pMy approach so far was to fragment each file into smaller packets of 1024 bytes, send one fragmenteach fragment1 asyncwritecall to the client and wait for the clients response. I need to fragment the data to allow the client to keep track of the download progress and speed. In retrospect I suppose this was rather nave, because the server has to wait for the clients response after each fragment. To check if this was the bottleneck, Ive increased the fragment size twice, giving me the following resultsp  precodea Fragment Size 1024bytes Transfer Speed 10KiBs b Fragment Size 8192bytes Transfer Speed 80KiBs c Fragment Size 20000bytes Transfer Speed 195KiBs codepre  pThe results speak for themselves, but Im unsure what to do now.p  pIm not too familiar with how the data transfer is actually handled internally, but if Im not mistaken all of my data is basically added onto a stream If thats the case, do I need to worry about how much data I write to that stream at once Does it make a difference at all whether I use multiple writecalls with small fragments as opposed to one writecall with a large fragment Are there any guidelines for thisp

Stuff or what exaclty p  pIm currently reading strongJava Network Programmingstrong, Elliotte Rusty Harold, is this what I need to learnp  pI developed a JavaFX 8 application and its out there, its free, now Im trying to develop a payed version, and one of the thing I will add is clientserver communication. Thanks a lotp
Positive 3739 pI have written small Java 7 Client and Server application. I have keystore with 3 Selfsigned X.509 RSA Certificates. When client connects through SSL, server sends SSL Certificate message with only one certificate. I am bit new to SSLTLS. I also looked at JSSE code sun.security.ssl.X509KeyManagerImpl, and found below commentsp  precode   Return the best alias that fits the given parameters.   The algorithm we use is     . scan through all the aliases in all builders in order     . as soon as we find a perfect match, return       i.e. a match with a cert that has appropriate key usage        and is not expired.     . if we do not find a perfect match, keep looping and remember       the imperfect matches     . at the end, sort the imperfect matches. we prefer expired certs       with appropriate key usage to certs with the wrong key usage.       return the first one of them.   private String More ...chooseAliasListltKeyTypegt keyTypeList,         Principal[] issuers, CheckType checkType codepre  pComment is pretty clear that server will send single best matching certificate but I dont seem to understand the reason. Like in my case, I want server to send all 3 certificates, so client can pick one and validate the chain. And also, if my client doesnt have the certificate that server sends, the connection is dropped with SSLHandshakeException No trusted certificate found. So my question is that why cant server send all 3 certificates if the client requested information from ClientHello matches with all 3 certificates  Is it something to do with TLS 1.0 vs TLS 1.2 p

Negative 3739 pRecently, I noticed my website was running slower and slower. I discovered 8GB Apache logs on my server I run a PlayFramework web application on a Debian 6 server and a bandwidth completely overloaded. Which was completely insane for a small personal website with a few views per day.p  pAfter investigating and gathering some information, I discovered my mistake  on my Apache configuration, I had uncommented the line ProxyRequests On, so my server was freely used as a free proxy for everybody in the world. What a shame.p  pAt least in that time, I adjusted my firewall to limit concurrent connections, and installed modqos for Apache2.p  pBut still, now instead of redirecting requests to their destination like a good free proxy, all incoming requests are redirected to my web application, whatever the domain is. For example if someone uses my server thinking it is still a working proxy to search for young naked children on yahoo, he will fall on my website. I think now you see my point.p  pThen, what should I do so that if a request for a hrefhttpyahoo.comwhatever relnofollowhttpyahoo.comwhatevera is sent to my server, the request is simply denied p  pHere is my current configuration p  ul lipin strongetcinit.dapache2sitesavailablemysite.frstrong p  precodeProxyRequests Off NameVirtualHost 80  ltVirtualHost 80gt       ServerName mysite.fr      ServerAlias .mysite.fr       ProxyPreserveHost On      ProxyPass  http127.0.0.19000 retry0      ProxyPassReverse   http127.0.0.19000        Uncomment the line below if your site uses SSL.

Negative 3739 pWe have a bunch of bundle packages and if one of the items is not available, the bundled product will show out of stock which is good.

Negative 3739 pI am trying to make a simple c process that uses a public encryption key to encrypt a file. I really only have 3 parameters to input, the input file, the public key, and the output file. I am trying to use the bountycastle dll, however, the code seems to go on about private or signed keys. Im new too this so I dont really understand it too well. Do I actually need this whole class, or is there a much shorter version which would do what Im looking for Do I only need a small subset of the below I tried pasting it in but it seems I needed methods from additional classes to get it to not bark.
