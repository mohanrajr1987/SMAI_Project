Positive 6621 pIve had a dig around but I cant seem to figure this one out, but it seems like a common scenario.p  pI am creating an application which has both a frontend and a backend. The application type is for that of an employment agency so I need login functionality for both employees of the company and candidates.p  pThe obvious thing here is that different data will be held for each user type. Would the general idea be to keep a single login table for both types of users or a separate one for company employees and another for candidates Or a single login table with an enum stating the user type does anyone have any online resources I could refer top  pThanks.p
