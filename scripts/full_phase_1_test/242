Negative 242 pI developed a nice game with libgdx  java, for android as target platform. I am almost at the end, only improving the maps is the remaining task. Till now I was running  debugging my game on desktop because you know libgdx is cross platform and my expectation was just right click and export for android. And of course I tried, then what all of a sudden I hit the wall. The problem is that my sound effects are not sounding fine on android.They are working great on desktop but not nice on android. Let me analyze the case with a few questions and on examples if we consider an explosion sound effect a scenario vehicle hits to an explosive I catch the contact from box2d and call play method on a explosion sound effect. what I expect is a normal explosion sound. In desktop I hear it, no problem but in android what I hear is just a very very short noisy really short perhaps a few miliseconds then a long silence after a while again a short noisy what did I tryp  pI tried the recommendations from many other threads they arep  ol liI tried it in formats 44.1k hz 16 bit wav file same format ogg file 22.05 k hz wav file they all sound same.li lisound effect will not be too short or too long. Okay, it is fine mine is 3 seconds.li liI tried to resave or arrange it with flstudio and audacity. li ol  pI tried them on s5 mini experia z1 and z3 all the same. p  pmp3 files are working great when I use music class  but I have a lot of sound effects and music class is not for that usage so I need to solve this problemp  pI tried a few other sound files different than my explosion sound effect with same conditions I mean sound formats frequence or bit rate etc...p  pI checked if the sound is loaded completely whether not. yes it is loaded completely but sounds same and of course I am playing it after a while my game starts.

So, I will keep thinking about the files. if they are broken or still a format issue do you have a working sound effect file or any suggestions about format I read somewhere 96khz 16 bit ogg file I tried it as well.p  pEDIT important noticep  pI played my game on mobile. I hit some explosives by car. it was sounding same then I went back to menu. I forgot my phone open. The game was running. But screen is locked automatically. It left like that perhaps 1520 minutes. Then to try one more time I unlocked the screen and what happened all of a sudden all explosives exploded I herd the sounds really fine and complete and menu screen was still being displayed. as a result I think I can conclude this when game pauses for enough time sound effects gets ready and can be played well. what does this mean now sound effects didnt load from memory yet but I am trying to play or getready has another meaning here I checked if it is loaded or not with asset managers isLoaded method it returned true. I did this just before calling the play method on sound. should I trust this isLoaded method or whatp  pWell, guys thanks for your helps in advance.p  pSorry I kept it a little long I will keep trying and researching..p

This jQuery is requesting the entire page again.

This way there is no page flicker by trying to just refresh the entire page.p
