Positive 7715 pI am trying to write a recursive function that will perform some action on every object within the list and then output a new list that matches the structure of the processed list exactly. I had some help from users here, but in my example i tried strings which happen to be iterable and work well with map. However when I am applying it to other data types like int that are not iterable, i get an errorp  precodedef processlistlist newlist  [] for x in list     if islistx         newlist.appendprocesslistx     else         newlist.appendmaplambda y y  1, x return newlist  def islistl return typel  types.ListType  list  [[0,1,2],[0,1,2],[0,1,2]],[0,1,2]] codepre  pi am using Integers as an example here because they are not iterable and i am expecting that map will fail on a list of integers. Imagine any other data type that is not iterable. Is there another way to define this that will let me perform some functions on objects within the list and then create an output list that matches the input list p  pthank you,p

Positive 7715 pi am searching for a way to store different type of pointers in a map without using void for obvious reasons. I actually know the types of the pointers at compiletime and these pointers as well as their types need to be const while their values need to be changed from times to times. The types are always some kind of numerical types. p  pstrongBackgroundstrong The variables behind these pointer are actually always global variables which need to changed if an specific event happens. Eachs event has an Id, the first member of that map, which changes the variable to a value transported by that event as a string.p  pSo far i think boostvariant would do the trick. I am new to variant and i dont know whether the following would work as expected regarding the constness, but i assume after reading the fcking manual that it should be ok. The main issue still is how to change that value behind that pointer utilising the standard conversionsp  precodeclass Data     public     typedef boostsharedptrltDatagt Ptr     typedef boostvariantltdouble, float, unsigned int, int, unsigned short, short, unsigned char, chargt PodPointerVariant     double factor     const PodPointerVariant varPointer      DataPodPointerVariant variable           factor0.0,         varPointervariable       stdmapltunsigned int, DataPtrgt dataMap unsigned int intValue   float floatValue  void main      intValue  1     DataPtr newEntrynew DataampintValue     newEntrygtfactor  1.1     dataMapgtinsertstdmakepair1,newEntry       Omitted find key and safety if not found...     unsigned int eventId  1     dataMap[eventId]gtvarPointer  2.1  dataMap[1]gtfactor  Should be automagically converted to 2 because the pointer is of type unsigned int, but gives a compiler error I cant dereference that normally.   codepre  pIs there an easy way to dereference like this Maybe using a visitor class Or anything else Ideally DatavarPointer shall only be initialised once and only the value may be changed, like a double  const, so i gets checked at compiledtime if somebody messes around with that pointer. p  pThank youp  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pAfter some trial and error i found out that it indeed works as expected. This is what ive done this farp  precodetemplatelttypename Ugt struct DeRefAssignVisitor  public booststaticvisitorltgt      U x     double factor     DeRefAssignVisitorU x, double factor  xx, factorfactor       template lttypename Tgt     void operatorT const p const              p  Tx  factor        class Data     public     typedef boostsharedptrltDatagt Ptr     typedef boostvariantltdouble  const, float const, unsigned long const, long const, unsigned short const, short const, unsigned char const, char const, plcbit constgt PodReferenceVariant     double factor     const PodPointerVariant varPointer      DataPodPointerVariant variable           factor0.0,         varPointervariable       template lttypename Tgt     void setPointerValueT value  boostapplyvisitorDeRefAssignVisitorltTgtvalue, thisgtfactor, thisgtvarPointer       stdmapltunsigned int, DataPtrgt dataMap unsigned int intValue   float floatValue  void main      intValue  1     floatValue  2.111     DataPtr newEntrynew DataampintValue     newEntrygtfactor  1.1     dataMapgtinsertstdmakepair1,newEntry       Omitted find key and safety if not found...     unsigned int eventId  1     dataMap[eventId]gtsetPointerValuefloatValue  Works like a charme converting compatible types automagically   codepre  pTemplates 4TW D Thanks everybodyp
