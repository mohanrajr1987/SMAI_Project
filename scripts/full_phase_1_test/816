Negative 816 h1Questionh1  pstrong1strong   Im looking for an appropriate way to design a web application, and specifically the database schema, so that I can have a base table with all the core fields for a given service, and then depending on the type of service, I will need an additional set of fields to be associated with the service.p  pI need to do this in such a way that performing searches will be straight forward and offer reasonable performance. Im probably looking at some type of fulltext searching, but would only have 5 concurrent users of the application, at most.p  pMy end goal for the application is to be able to pretty much search the entire database for any given keyword and return all related records. I was initially looking to split out the set fields for each service type into separate tables with their own columns, but Im thinking that in doing so it might lead to more complicated search queries Many JOINs or many more queries to be run per search.p  pFor any solution proposed, can you please specify why you think this would be a good fitp  pstrong2strong   My other issue as will hopefully become clear below is that my design currently consists of a service types table where I would define the core types of each product, where each service is then an instance of a given product.p  pMy issue here is that it feels like Ill probably end up most duplicating things if I have both a products and a service types table. So to avoid this duplication is the other main thing Im trying to achieve in my design.p  h1More Detailsh1  pIm currently writing a custom web application used to track the services provisioned on a percustomer basis, not only for invoicing billing cycle, startend date, price but also for documentation of those services associated user accounts,  IP addresses, physical assets, etc.p  pEach service is based off a product table which defines the name of a base product, the price, billing duration, description, etc... We could have multiple products of the same type eg. For different plans of a given product type. For example, we have the following productsp  ul liShared WebHosting Plan Oneli liShared WebHosting Plan Twoli liShared WebHosting Plan Threeli liDedicated Server Planli liVirtual Dedicated Server Plan Oneli liVirtual Dedicated Server Plan Twoli ul  pRight now the issue I have is that, we have a number of fields which are common to any given service, but we also have a number of fields which change, depending on the type of service being tracked. Depending on the type of the service, I will display the base form for all services, but also the appropriate form for addingediting etc... p  pFor example, we have the following service types, and each product as shown above would relate to one of these core service typesp  ul liShared Web Hostingli liDedicated Hostingli liVirtual Dedicated Hostingli liADSLli li...li ul  h1My Possible Solutionsh1  h2Current Solution  Multiple Tablesh2  pCurrently, in my database, I havep  pstrongServiceTypesstrongp  ul liServiceTypeID INT PKli liType VARCHAR40li ul  pstrongProductstrongp  ul liProductID INT PKli liName VARCHAR40li liDescription TEXTli liPrice DECIMALli liBillingDuration INTli liTypeID INT FK ServiceTypes.ServiceTypeIDli ul  pstrongServicestrongp  ul liServiceID INT PKli liProductID INT FK Product.ProductIDli liName VARCHAR40li liDescription TEXTli liPrice DECIMALli liBillingDuration INTli liActive BITli liStartDate DATETIMEli liEndDate DATETIMEli ul  pThose are the main tables for any service, then Ive got additional tables for the extended propertiesp  pstrongServiceADSLInfostrongp  ul liServiceADSLInfoID INT PKli liServiceID INT FK Service.ServiceIDli liFNN VARCHAR10li liUsername VARCHAR20li liPassword VARCHAR20li liLocationID INT FK Locations.LocationIDli liModemAssetID INT FK Assets.AssetIDli ul  pstrongServiceVirtualServerInfostrongp  ul liServiceVirtualServerInfo INT PKli liServiceID INT FK Service.ServiceIDli liServerName VARCHAR20li liIPAddress INT FK IPAddresses.AddressIDli liHostServer INT FK Assets.AssetIDli liUsername VARCHAR20li liPassword VARCHAR20li ul  pstrongServiceSharedHostingInfostrongp  ul liServiceSharedHostingInfoID INT PKli liServiceID INT FK Service.ServiceIDli liHostname VARCHAR50li liHostServer INT FK Assets.AssetIDli liDiskSpaceQuota INTli liBandwidthQuota INTli ul  h2Other Solution  Single Tableh2  pIm thinking of storing all service related information in a single table, regardless of the type of service, and just have the values be NULL if theyre not needed for that particular service.p  ul liServiceID INT PKli liProductID INT FK Product.ProductIDli liName VARCHAR40li liDescription TEXTli liPrice DECIMALli liBillingDuration INTli liActive BITli liStartDate DATETIMEli liEndDate DATETIMEli liUsername VARCHAR20li liPassword VARCHAR20li liFNN VARCHAR10li liLocationID INT FK Locations.LocationIDli liAssetID INT FK Assets.AssetIDli li...li ul  pI feel like this might be an easier solution to work with in terms of searching as well, since in order to service any service related data, I can just use a full text search on the single table, and not worry about joining records together.p  pMy main concern here would be that I end up with a table that has 30 columns, which seems like it could get pretty messy. The other thing is that it doesnt solve both my concerns, because I would still need to have the core serviceTypes table to figure out which fields I need to use for any given search  and hence still have some overlap with my products table.p  pIm wondering if some degree of overlap with the products table is impossible to avoidp  h2EntityAttributeValue modelh2  pIve considered this design as well. Overall, I feel like this is overkill for me as I dont need things to be emthatem flexible and dynamic. We will need a set group of fields depending on the service type, but the data we need to collect on each core service type I cant see changing any time soon, so this can be static.p  pIt also seems to me that the application logic needed to implement this level of flexibility would be far too complicated for the benefits it brings.p  pHaving to determine the type of HTML form field to display depending on the type of the field queried from the database etc... Just sounds painful.p  pPlease let me know if there are any further details I can provide I hope everything is clear.p  pThanksp
