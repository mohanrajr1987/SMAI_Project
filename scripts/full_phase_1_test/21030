Positive 21030 pI need to track four points on a series of photos of a moving object.  At first, I tried markers that looked like four squares of a chessboard 2 white and 2 black and ORB detectorp  precodeimport numpy as np import cv2 from matplotlib import pyplot as plt  img  cv2.imreadDworkspaceRitaTag5.jpg,0  orb  cv2.ORBcreate   find the keypoints with ORB kp  orb.detectimg,None kp, des  orb.computeimg, kp  img2  cv2.drawKeypointsimg,kp,None,color0,255,0, flags0 plt.imshowimg2,plt.show codepre  pImage a hrefhttppostimg.orgimage52phl54rz relnofollowhttppostimg.orgimage52phl54rzap  plong with the required points centers of the markers, I got a lot of noise, so I decided to change chessboard markers to fiducial ones, drawn in ARTag style. Moreover, these markers would help identify the points, if the object rotates. Now, with the same Python code, I getp  pImage a hrefhttppostimg.orgimagef58zzrkl5 relnofollowhttppostimg.orgimagef58zzrkl5ap  pStill I have noise points detected, and I dont see an easy way to extract the coordinates of the markers centers from the keypoints mass. I think, I need either to adjust the sensitivity of the detector maybe, do some prefiltering of the image, or find another algorithm.p  pI would appreciate ideas and examples, which detectors or algorithms I could use to track fiducial markers centers in the easiest way, preferring Python language and Open CV.p
Positive 21030 pWhat is the point of image segmentation algorithms like SLIC Most object detection algorithms work over the entire set of square subimages anyway. p  pThe only conceivable benefit to segmenting the image is that now, the classifier has shape information available to it. Is that right p  pMost classifiers I know of take rectangular input images. What classifiers allow you to pass variable sized image segments to themp

Positive 21030 pI have trained a cascade object detector in MatLab.

Positive 21030 pFrom what Ive understood, tracking algorithms predict where a given object will be in the next frame after object detection is already performed. The object is then again recognized in the next frame. What isnt clear is how the tracker then knows to associate the object in the 2nd frame as the same as the one in the 1st, especially when there are multiple objects in the frame.p  pIve seen in a few places that a cost matrix is created using Euclidean distance between the prediction and all detections, and the problem is framed as an assignment problem Hungarian algorithm.p  pIs my understanding of tracking correct Are there other ways of establishing that an object in one frame is the same as an object in the next framep
