How do i specify array in where clause  p
Negative 54630 pI have created a method to parse data from a JSON URL.p  pThe data is put into a list and I want to show it in tabular form which I can.p  pI have getter and setter methods to getset the information but when I use the get method for the Timestamp and deviceId, it returns a value. But when I use the get method for the measurment and measuring, it returns null0.p  pHere is the JSON URL I am parsing fromp  precode status success, records [              timestamp 1381735967866,         deviceId 288,         temperature 3304500     ,              timestamp 1381735997866,         deviceId 288,         temperature 3304500     ,              timestamp 1381736027866,         deviceId 288,         temperature 3304500      codepre  pThat is only a snippet, but that is basically it.p  pHere is the java code used to divide the informationp  precodepublic class Records   private long timestamp private int deviceId private String measuring private int measurment  public long getTimestamp        return timestamp    public int getDeviceId        return deviceId    public String getMeasuring      return measuring   public int getMeasurment      return measurment   public void setTimestamplong timestamp        this.timestamp  timestamp    public void setDeviceIdint deviceId        this.deviceId  deviceId    public void setMeasuringString measuring      this.measuring  measuring   public void setMeasurmentint measurment      this.measurment  measurment   public String toString      return String.formatTimestamp dtDevice ID dts d, timestamp, deviceId, measuring, measurment   codepre  pI call the String measuring and not temperature as there is other JSON URLs I am also parsing and they have different values to temperature load, displacement etc but deviceId and Timestamp are the same.p  pHere is how I print up the resultsp  precodeGson gson  new Gson Elements elements  gson.fromJsonjsonString, Elements.class  long previousTimestamp  01 long result  forRecords records  elements.getRecords      System.out.printlnrecords  n  codepre  pThe printed result is thisp  pTimestamp 1381746686550    Device ID 288  null 0p  pTimestamp 1381746716550    Device ID 288  null 0p  pTimestamp 1381746746550    Device ID 288  null 0p  pTimestamp 1381746776550    Device ID 288  null 0p  pTimestamp 1381746806550    Device ID 288  null 0p  pTimestamp 1381746836550    Device ID 288  null 0p  pTimestamp and deviceId print out but measurment and measuring does not.p  pWhat I was hoping for when I call the temperature URL, temperature will be in place of null and an int value in place of 0. Same for displacement, load etcp  pDoes anybody have any information or help, it would be great, thanksp

Negative 54630 pI work in an environment that is very agile.  We typically have daily rollouts.  That ability is necessary due to the nature of our business.  Often we have updates to the database.  We built a home brewed database migration library, however there is currently no concept of a version, and the migrations are not run sequentially.  We have decided to refactor and run the migration sequentially, however we now find that in order to do so we must create a sequence and each migration must have a unique version.  How is this accomplished in an automated way in an environment where multiple developers are working in parallelp  pExample  3 branches are merged together to be promoted to staging, each branch has a data base migration to be run.  How do we determine which comes before the other that requires minimal human interaction.p
