Positive 2097 pI have seen many examples of how to implement the Iterable interface where the iterator method merely returns the original collection to be iterated. But this seems to defy part of the purpose of an iterator, in that one should be able to iterate over said collection without worrying about the collection changing underneath you. Shouldnt the iterator method of an Iterable always return a clone of the collection And, preferably, a deep clonep  pI know, answers to this question may be partially based on opinion, which is verboten. However, what I am trying to get at is the original intent of the Iterable interface, NOT what people may or may not have decided to do with it.p
