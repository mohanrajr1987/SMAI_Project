I am developing an alarm system which will show fail whenever the strain readings jump outside these linear slopes. What I am asking is if there is any other way of statistically producing upper and lower bound curves outside of normal distribution confidence levels, as my methods will sound an alarm all to oftenp

Positive 402 pOff late i am profilling my application on ARM CortexA15 and observed more cache misses  in  one function which take three arguments from global buffers. The function is sinple IIR filter which accesses states at start and updates states  at the end. If i use state as such it goes for toss and gives huge cache misses. If i copy state values in to local buffer to that function and use local copy of the state throughout the function gives less cache misses. The size of the state is hardly 10 values of int type. Could you please through some insight whats happening in cache front How to avoid this kind of senario p
