Positive 190 pWe would like to deploy Zend framework in Bluemix. We used the recommended buildpack a hrefhttpsgithub.comzendtechzendserverphpbuildpackbluemix relnofollowhttpsgithub.comzendtechzendserverphpbuildpackbluemixa, however it does not help. For deployment we need to change Document Root to their public folder.p  pIn practice it can be done via changing apache configs or adding htaccess file. So we are not able changing the apache configs, therefore we added htaccess file for it. The folder has been created and via htaccess the document root has been changed it works. But when the framework has been pushed it does not work The blank page is appeared without PHP runtime errors.p

Positive 190 pWhen using AWS, it seems a nice way to deploy an application to a newly created instance is via AWS CodeDeploy. This works as followsp  ol liSet up an autoscaling group for the applicationli liWrite a userdata bash script for the autoscaling group which pulls the CodeDeploy agent from S3, installs it and starts itli liSet up a CodeDeploy deployment group which deploys to the autoscaling groupli ol  pNow, when an application bundle e.g. jar or debian package is deployed to the deployment group, it will be deployed automatically to new instances launched in the autoscaling group.p  pMy question is how can this deployment strategy fit with a CI tool like Travis CIp  pSpecificallyp  ul liHow can CodeDeploy pick up a package built by a CI tool like Travis CI Does the build job need to upload the package to S3li liHow can CodeDeploy be used to deploy the application gradually e.g. one instance at a timeli liDoes this deployment strategy require each running instance to be shut down and replaced, or is the new version of the application deployed on the existing instances If it is the former, machine IP addresses would change during deployment, so how can other services discover the newly deployed application i.e. without hardcoded IP addressesli ul
