Negative 218 pIve got a test app that fetches latlng values from the HTML5 geolocation service.  Unfortunately, its firing at rather inconsistent time intervals, anywhere from 500ms to 10000ms.  Ive tried changing the maximimAge and timeout parameters for the watch but those dont seem to change anything.  Im testing it in Chrome as well as via a simple Cordova app on an Android Lollipop build.  The code below simply displays the timestamp value of the watch to eliminate any other delays that could be causing the issue.  It appears that the interval is close to a 1 second then 5 second repeating pattern.
