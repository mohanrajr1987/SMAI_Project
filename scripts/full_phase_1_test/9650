Positive 9650 pI have written a program C which loads a form.  On the primary screen it displays different text when I click OK.  But the problem is... I am working with dual monitor, so when I load a form on the primary screen and drag it to secondary screen and click OK, it automatically moves back to the primary screen. p  pI have written a method which determines which screen the form is currently loaded on, which is working fine. However, when I tried to relocate it to the secondary screen, it no longer works its still moving back to the primary screen.

And the fourth workstation I tried it on was our CFOs workstation and I got the same results as on the virtual RD session, it didnt release the EXCEL process until after the form app was closed.p  pOn the virtual RD session my user doesnt have local admin rights, but on the other three workstations I tried, the users all had local admin rights, including the CFO where it didnt end the process.p  pIm getting a bit desperate at this point, any thoughts or ideas would be very welcomed.p  pstrongSecond Editstrongp  pAlso, it seems when using the above approach my Outlook and a few other applications like Syteline ERP crash constantly, Im not sure if its codeGC.Collectcode or codereleaseObjectcode that started causing it, but my Outlook and ERP definitely did NOT crash until I added those two to my form app. The crashes are random and I cant replicate the exact issue that causes it, but so far it only happens AFTER the user has used either the import or export feature on my form app, both of which use codeInterop.Excelcodep  pI tried changing it to justp  precode        xlBook.Closefalse         xlApp.Quit         GC.Collect         GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers codepre  pBut this does not kill the EXEC.exe process until the form app is closed.p  pstrongFinal Editstrongp  pFound the answer in the linked duplicate post. I missed it on my first read through, so Ill add the code that ended up working for me on every workstation.p  pBasically I moved the code that does the actual Excel Reading to its own function and I then called that function from my codebtnBrowseClickcode event. The trick as Hans Passant pointed out in the linked answer, is WHERE I put the codeGC.Collectcode command.p  pIn my codegetExcelFileInfocode event I close and quit my codexlBookcode and codexlAppcode, but I put the codeGC.Collectcode command in the codefinally code secion of my codebtnBrowseClickcode event.p  precodeprivate void btnBrowseClickobject sender, EventArgs e      try              getExcelFileInfo          catch Exception ex              frmMessage msgFrm  new frmMessageAn Error has occurred..., null, ex.Message  n  n  Error Code 269, Error         msgFrm.ShowDialog          finally              GC.Collect         GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers        private void getExcelFileInfo      Excel.Application xlApp  null     Excel.Workbook xlBook  null     Excel.Worksheet xlSheet  null     try              xlApp  new Excel.Application         xlBook  xlApp.Workbooks.OpentxtFilePath.Text         xlSheet  new Excel.Worksheet           Read the excel file          catch Exception ex              frmMessage msgFrm  new frmMessageAn Error has occurred..., null, ex.Message  n  n  Error Code 357, Error         msgFrm.ShowDialog          finally              xlBook.Closefalse         xlApp.Quit       codepre

Negative 9650 pSo I use the following utility to get the name of a fieldproperty from an instance of a class...p  precodepublic static string FieldNameltTgtExpressionltFuncltTgtgt Source      return MemberExpressionSource.Body.Member.Name  codepre  pThis allows me to do the followingp  precodepublic class CoolCat      public string KaratePower   public class Program      public static Main              public CoolCat Jimmy  new CoolCat          string JimmysKaratePowerField  FieldName gt Jimmy.KaratePower       codepre  pThis is great for serialization and other times when I need a string representation of the field name.p  pBut now, I want to be able to get the field name WITHOUT having an instance of the class  for instance, if I am setting up a table and want to dynamically link the FieldNames of the columns to actual fields in a class so refactorings, etc. will not break it.p  pBasically, I feel like I just dont quite get the syntax of how to accomplish this, but I imagine that it will look something like thisp  precodepublic static string ClassFieldNameltTgtFuncltTgt PropertyFunction        Do something to get the field name  Im not sure whether Func is the right thing here  but I would imagine that it is something where I could pass in a lambda type expression or something of the sort   public class Program      public static Main              string CatsPowerFieldName  ClassFieldNameltCoolCatgtx gt x.KaratePower           This CatsPowerFieldName would be set to KaratePower.       codepre  pI hope that makes sense  Im not very good with the vocab around this subject so I know that the question is a little vague.p  pThanks in advancedp  pWilliamp
Negative 9650 pI have a page with php query results in a table. Now I want to click on a table column name to sort it on that. So what I want to do is reload the page with the same querystring but change one parameter amporderbyname.p  pThe only way I can think of is to get the query with SERVER[QUERYSTRING] and then search and replace the one parameter with regular expressions.
