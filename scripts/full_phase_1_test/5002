Negative 5002 pI have a pixellocation, well call it 4,4 on a graph. Im attempting to refactor a function that checks to see if pixels around it, meet a certain criteria, in all 8 directions diagonally, horizontally, and vertically, and if it meets that criteria, take a common action, that has a return value.p  pFor instancep  precodeint weight0 if CheckWeightnew Point4,4  true     weight 100 if CheckWeightnew Point4,5  true     weight 10 if CheckWeightnew Point4,3  true     weight 10 if CheckWeightnew Point5,5  true     weight 10 if CheckWeightnew Point3,3  true     weight 10 if CheckWeightnew Point3,4  true     weight 10 if CheckWeightnew Point5,4  true     weight 10 if CheckWeightnew Point5,3  true     weight 10 if CheckWeightnew Point3,5  true     weight 10 codepre  pIs there a good way to refactor these, so if I have to change certain things here, such as function Im calling to check the weight, or condition Im checking against, or weight increment, that Im not duplicating my efforts 8 timesp  pIve had other programmers I know already suggest to just strongcombinestrong them under one check, which I obviously cant do, cause it might meet 3 of these checks, and give me a weight of 30 this time, and 5 of these checks and give me a weight of 50 next time.p  pstrongEditstrong This routine will be run on 1920x1080 pixel maps, so several million times performance could be a real issue involved in the refactoring.p
Negative 5002 pIm writing a program in Common Lisp for editing binary files generated by Minecraft that use the NBT format, documented here a hrefhttpminecraft.gamepedia.comNBTformatcookieSetuptruehttpminecraft.gamepedia.comNBTformatcookieSetuptruea Im aware that such tools exist, such as NBTEditor and MCEdit, but neither are written in Common Lisp, and I thought this project would make an excellent learning exercise.p  pSo far one of the only things that I havent managed to implement on my own is a function for reading a UTF8 string of known length that contains characters that are represented using more than one octet i.e. nonASCII characters. In the NBT format, every string is UTF8 encoded and is preceded by a short two octet integer codencode denoting the strings length. So, assuming that only ASCII characters are present in the string, I can simply read a sequence of codencode octets from the stream and convert it to a string using like sop  precodedefun readutf8string stringlength bytestream   let seq makearray stringlength elementtype unsignedbyte 8                                        fillpointer t     setf fillpointer seq readsequence seq bytestream     flexistreamsoctetstostring seq externalformat utf8 codepre  pBut if one or more of the characters has a character code greater than 255, it is encoded in two or more bytes, as seen in this examplep  precodeflexistreamsstringtooctets wife externalformat utf8 gt 119 105 102 101  flexistreamsstringtooctets  externalformat utf8 gt 208 182 208 181 208 189 208 176 codepre  pBoth strings have the same length, but each character of the Russian word is encoded in double the number of octets, so the total size of the string is double that of the English one. So knowing the string length does not help if using readsequence. Even if the size of the string i.e. the number of octets needed to encode it was known, there would still be no way of knowing which of those octets to convert to character form individually and which to group together for conversion. So instead of rolling my own function, I tried to find a way to get either the implementation Clozure CL or an external library do the work for me. Unfortunately this too has been problematic, because my parser relies on using the same file stream for all reading functions, like thisp  precodewithopenfile stream test.dat direction input                                    elementtype unsignedbyte 8   Read entire contents of NBT file from stream here codepre  pwhich limits me to the codeelementtype unsignedbyte 8code and therefore prohibits me from specifying a character encoding and using readchar or equivalent like thisp  precodewithopenfile stream test.dat externalformat utf8   ... codepre  pThe codeelementtypecode has to be codeunsignedbyte 8code so that I can read and write integers and floats of various sizes. To avoid having to manually convert sequences of octets to strings, I first wondered whether there was a way to change the element type to that of a character while the file is open, which led me to this discussion here a hrefhttpsgroups.google.comforumsearchincomp.lang.lispbinaryhttpsgroups.google.comforumsearchincomp.lang.lispbinarya20write20readcomp.lang.lispN0IESNPSPCUQmcvtk0HkC0J Apparently some CL implementations such as SBCL use bivalent streams by default, so both readbyte and readchar can be used on the same stream if I were to take this approach, I would still need to be able to specify an codeexternalformatcodeto the stream codeutf8code, although this format should only apply when reading characters, and not when reading raw bytes.p  pI have used a couple of functions from flexistreams in the above examples for brevitys sake, but as yet my code uses only the builtin stream types, and I have yet to use flexistreams themselves. strongIs this problem a good candidate for flexistreams Having an additional layer of abstraction that would allow me to read raw bytes and UTF8 characters interchangeably from the same stream would be ideal.strongp  pAny advice from those familiar with flexistreams or other relevant approaches would be very much appreciated.p  pThank you.p

Negative 5002 pIm developing an ASP.NET Webforms application and while using the WebUserControl I stumbled upon a behavior I dont understand.p  pMy WebUserControl puts 4 strings into the ViewStatep  precodevar projectCode  SelectedProject.Value ViewState[ProjectCode]  projectCode  var resourceId  SelectedResource.Value ViewState[ResourceCode]  resourceId  var indicatorId  SelectedIndicator.Value ViewState[IndicatorCode]  indicatorId  var areaCode  SelectedArea.Value ViewState[AreaCode]  areaCode codepre  pWhen thats done, my page should get these values from the ViewState, but the ViewState does not contain any items and returns codenullcode for all 4 keys.p  pWhy is the ViewState on the page level empty And if I shouldnt use the ViewState for this, whats the best method to pass values forth and backp
Negative 5002 pI am wondering if anybody know if it is at all possible that the accessToken expiry time be auto refreshedp  pLast night when working on my app, after a couple hours away from the computer and came back to see that my app was firing errors due to the token reaching its expiry time.  So I started working on some code to refresh the token in the event of an error.  Today I am trying to testdebug that code, but now the token seems to never expire.p  pI have a bit of Javascript that is printing the response.authResponse.expiresIn on the screen every 5 seconds... and I watch... as the number ticks down, suddenly it jumps back up to 7000  guessing roughly 2 hours on its own, without any interaction from myself.p  pCan Facebook be auto refreshing the token some how  I cannot test the code that is fired in the event of an error, if there is no error actually being fired.p  pCheers, Chrisp
