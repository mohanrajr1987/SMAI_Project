Im using emMyContactListenerem from raywenderlich.com tutorial.p  pSo, the main question is How to know what type of body is in collision with the heros body through the contact listenerp  pive read many tutorials and questions on here and I cant seem to know where to beginp  pThanksp  pEditp  pSi, I finally got it to work with sprite.tag, but I cant destroy the bodies and the textures. Sometimes when using code[textureB removeFromParentAndCleanupYES]code I get codeEXCBADACCESScode. And as I understood, I cant destroy the body since Im actually using it.p  pBut when trying to use codebodygtSetUserDataselfcode in my Hero classp  precodeinterface Hero  CCNode  CCSprite  texture CGPoint position b2Body body TypeCase type  codepre  pI get codeEXCBADACCESScode in my update methodp  precodeforb2Body b  worldgtGetBodyList b bbgtGetNext      if bgtGetUserData  NULL          if [bgtGetUserData isKindOfClass[Hero class]]                      Hero hero  HerobgtGetUserData             CCSprite heroSprite  hero.texture             heroSprite.position  ccpbgtGetPosition.x  PTMRATIO,                                 bgtGetPosition.y  PTMRATIO                  else if [bgtGetUserData isKindOfClass[Tile class]]                      Tile tile  TilebgtGetUserData             CCSprite tileSprite  tile.texture             tileSprite.position  ccpbgtGetPosition.x  PTMRATIO,                                 bgtGetPosition.y  PTMRATIO                       codepre  pI get EXCBADACCESS when calling isKindOfClass.p  pstrongHero userDatastrongp  precodeb2BodyDef heroBodyDef heroBodyDef.fixedRotation  true heroBodyDef.type  b2dynamicBody heroBodyDef.position.Setposition.xPTMRATIO, position.yPTMRATIO body  worldgtCreateBodyampheroBodyDef bodygtSetUserDataself codepre  pstrongTile userDatastrongp  precodeb2BodyDef blockBodyDef blockBodyDef.type  b2staticBody blockBodyDef.position.Setposition.xPTMRATIO, position.yPTMRATIO blockBodyDef.userData  self b2Body body  world gtCreateBodyampblockBodyDef codepre
Negative 1817 pI would like to use rfcv to cull the unimportant variables from a data set before creating a final random forest with more trees please correct and inform me if thats not the way to use this function.  For example,p  precodegt     datafgl, packageMASS gt     tst lt rfcvtrainx  fgl[,10], trainy  fgl[,10], scale  log, step0.7 gt     tsterror.cv         9         6         4         3         2         1  0.2289720 0.2149533 0.2523364 0.2570093 0.3411215 0.5093458 codepre  pIn this case, if I understand the result correctly, it seems that we can remove three variables without negative side effects.  However,p  precodegt     attributestst names [1] n.var     error.cv  predicted codepre  pNone of these slots tells me what those first three variables that can be harmlessly removed from the dataset actually were.p
Negative 1817 pstrongDisclaimerstrong I only have a very basic understanding of how Web Services work and dont know much about advanced WS topics such transactions, etc.p  pLets pretend that I am developing an online store using Java EE, JPA, etc. Also lets pretend that I have a contract with an online payment processing provider to handle payments and they have provided me with a WS API.p  pNow lets pretend that a customer has placed an order. In a session bean e.g. inside codeOrderSB.placeOrdercode I have opened a transaction, saved an Order in the DB, and now I am making a call to the payment providers WS API. It returns successfully and I assume that by now my customers account has been debited but before I can save the Orders associated Payment theres onetoone relationship between Order and Payment an exception occurs and my transaction is rolled back.p  pHow is it possible to ensure that when such an exception happens, my customers account is not debited Or in other words either both of the WS call and codeOrderSB.placeOrdercode should complete successfully and commit or both of them should be rolled back together.p  pIts easy to roll back codeplaceOrdercode if the WS call fails, but I dont know how I can roll back the WS call after it returns.p
