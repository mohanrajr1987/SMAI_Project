Positive 76 pI am reverse engineering things and I often stumble upon various decompression algorithms.

The first one treats the input as sequence of bitsp  blockquote   ol start2   li...      ol   liRead emflagem as one bitli   liIf its set, read literal byte as 8 unaligned bitsli   liIf its not set, read length and position as emnem and emmem unaligned bitsli   olli   ol blockquote  pThis involves lots of bit shift operations.p  pThe other one saves a little CPU time by using bitwise operations only for emflagem storage, whereas literal bytes, length and position are derived from aligned input bytes. To achieve this, it breaks the linearity by fetching a few emflagsem in advance. So the algorithm is modified like thisp  blockquote   ol start2   li...      ol   liRead 8 emflagsem at once by reading one byte. For each of these 8 flags      ol   liIf its set, read literal as aligned byteli   liIf its not set, read length and position as aligned bytes deriving the specific values from the fetched bytes involves some bit operations, but its nowhere as expensive as the first version.li   olli   olli   ol blockquote  pMy question is are these both valid LZSS implementations, or did I identify these algorithms wrong Are there any known names for themp

Negative 76 pI was discussing with a coworker the other day the similarities of implementing a Software Factory for your development organization vs. using more of a scaffolding solution like active record. We both thought that implementing a Software factory may be considered by some to be a good idea when you have a larger group of developers and you want to maintain a certain level of consistency and convention within your code base. p  pThinking about it a little more, I realized that I really like the idea of Software Factories for personal use, because they make it easier for me to code up the projects that I work on for fun as they save me a lot of headache in writing boilerplate code.  That being said, I would bet that enforcing the use of a Software Factory in larger organizations might cause some strife within the team because some developers may think that it would be an infringement on their ability to be creativep  pSo what Im wondering from those of you who have been part of an organization that has implemented factories is what strongemcriteriaemstrong would it take to dictate the use of a factory within an organization, when the risk may be a bunch of unhappy developersp
