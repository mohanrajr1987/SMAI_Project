Positive 627 pI have an app whos activity starts a service to play a downloaded podcast.  As the user pressed the BACK key to get to the hope screen the service continues to play the podcast as expected.  However if the user launches a broswer doesnt matter which one and navigates to a page that loads a bunch of high res images, of which I can recreate over and over, my service is being killed by the OS due to low memoryIm guessing. p  pAs a result Im getting nailed for having an app that crashes when it is not crashing, the service is getting yanked.p  pThe STICKY flags dont give me the option of exiting gracefully or letting the user know what happened.p  pHow does a service get around letting the user know that it was terminated because of an outside app  p

Positive 627 pI am developing android application right now, strongwhich sends requests to the server every 4 secondsstrong. I need to make sure that app strongwill keep sending them even if it goes to backgroundstrong by pressing home button, opening another app or receiving phone call. As far as I know, the best solution for this is to use strongservicesstrong. The question is, does service guarantee that it will never get destroyed by the operating system And if it does get destroyed how can I handle this situation restart the servicep  pOr may be there is a better solution than android servicep  pApp can have any permission over device or operating system, but it must not be rooted. So we can easily update it through google play store. p  pThank you very much in advancep  pPS. Please dont hesitate to ask me questions if something is unclear.p
