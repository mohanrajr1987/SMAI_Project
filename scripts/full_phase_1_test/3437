Positive 3437 pIve been using CakePHP to develop an application and I have some basic permissions that are aimed to restrict the ability of the users and help to prevent errors.p  pI have a form where someone with the a certain permission or higher can create a new member of staff. One of the fields in the form allows them to associate a school to a member of staff. If they have the minimum access required I would like selection to autofill as the school the creator has associated with them and then if they are an admin they have the option of choosing from the selection.p  pIn the controller I am calling this line which populates the array of schoolsp  precodethisgtsetschools, thisgtStaffgtSchoolgtfindlist, arrayconditions gt arraySchool.active gt null, order gt arrayname gt ASC codepre  pAnd the array looks like thisp  precodearray4    [2]gt string15 School A   [3]gt string15 School B   [1]gt string17 School C   [6]gt string21 School D  codepre  pThe codeAuthComponentcode stores the school id in the following way codeAuthComponentuserschoolidcode and for the purpose of this the value is set to code1code.p  pIn the add view the conditions for showing the selection look like thisp  precodeif AuthComponentuseradmin  1      echo thisgtFormgtinputschoolid, arraylabel gt School ,    options gt arrayschools, required gt required  else      echo thisgtFormgtinputschoolid, arraylabel gt School , value gt schools[AuthComponentuserschoolid], disabled gt disabled  codepre  pFor some reason the disabled view defaults to showing the first school in the list. I have used codevardumpschools[AuthComponentuserschoolid]code which returns codeString8 gt School Ccodeso I am confused on why the selection will not show correctly.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions or an alternative solution to achieving the same outcomep

Negative 3437 pI am refreshing images via attrsrc, newimage, where newimage may point to one of several images and may already be cached by the browser. Unfortunately the browser cache is being completely ignored when requesting through this method.p  pAll images in this example are indeed being cached by the browser. When initially fetched from the server, the server returns correct CacheControl, LastModified and Etag headers. When running attrsrc, newimage with jQuery, the initiated request neither checks the browser cache, nor sends the request headers IfModifiedSince and IfNoneMatch p  pDoes anybody know how to tell jQuery to check the browser cache before sending a request to the serverp  pBTW, I am using jQuery 1.7.1p

Negative 3437 pI just wrote a RTC driver for an NXP RTC chip on my board, it works great.  This chip also has some battery backed RAM that Id like to make available to a user space application.  The RTC framework doesnt support this.  Its only 512 bytes but Im tossed between doing a seekable CHAR driver or a full blown BLOCK driver.  Ive never done a block driver before but it appears to require a bit more information than a simple CHAR.p  pI could also interface with IOCTLS but that doesnt feel as clean as it could be.  What feels like the best way to make these bytes available to userland  p  p[EDIT] I forgot to mention that that the RTC chip is hanging off an I2C port, its not mapped into memory, thus not making it a good candidate for mmaping.
