Positive 4183 pI have the following situation There are two DIV elements that are positioned absolute at the same position and with the same dimensions. The div element a has a zindex of 10, the div element b a zindex of 20.

Positive 4183 pI have an application where if a user action takes a certain amount of time, a dialog is shown that the interface is processing the action. Usually when the action is done, the dialog closes and the user can continue doing what he was doing before. This seems to work nearly always but every now and then the focus is moved from the component that was focused to the component that is 2 places after it in the focus chain.p  pIm not able to create a small example program to show what is exactly happening but I have been able to debug the problem to a point where Im hoping that someone could help me.p  pWhat seems to happen is this p  ol liA sun.awt.TimedWindowEvent[WINDOWGAINEDFOCUS, main window...] event is processed by the dialog and passed on to the DefaultKeyboardFocusManager DKFM which will attempt to restoreFocus to the main window.brli liThe DKFM tells the MostRecentFocusOwner to focus itselfbrli liThe component registers itself as the MostRecentFocusOwner and tries to actually focus itself by calling peer.requestFocus.brli liIn WComponentPeer, the frame is focused but for some reason it returns falsebrli liThe component sees it wasnt focused so it returns false as wellbrli liThe DKFM sees that the component wasnt focused so it attempts to focus the next componentbrli liStep 35brli liAnother focus event triggers, triggering step 17 again but because step 3 registers the new component as MostRecentFocusOwner the loop goes over the component from 6 and the next one from therebrli liAnother focus event triggers triggering the logic from step 1 but now step 4 returns true. The main window is shown and the wrong component is now focused.li ol  pFor 4 The thing that seems to be different in the situations where it works and where it doesnt is that the WComponentPeer checks after the focus request for the parentWindow where in the correct situations the parentWindow.isFocused is true and in the failing situations the parentWindow.isFocused will return false. The logging that is shown when I turn on the focus logging is rejectFocusRequestHelper [...] Waiting for asynchronous processing of the request. br This seems to indicate that the WComponentPeer knows about the possibility of having to handle focus requests asynchronously but the DKFM doesnt.p  pThe relevant stacktrace is as followsp  precodeKeyboardFocusManager.setMostRecentFocusOwnerWindow, Component line 1814   KeyboardFocusManager.setMostRecentFocusOwnerComponent line 1801   TheComponentComponent.requestFocusHelperboolean, boolean, CausedFocusEventCause line 7618 3 TheComponentComponent.requestFocusInWindowCausedFocusEventCause line 7533  DefaultKeyboardFocusManager.doRestoreFocusComponent, Component, boolean line 172 6  DefaultKeyboardFocusManager.restoreFocusWindow, Component, boolean line 151  2 DefaultKeyboardFocusManager.restoreFocusWindowEvent line 134  DefaultKeyboardFocusManager.dispatchEventAWTEvent line 302    ProgressDialogComponent.dispatchEventImplAWTEvent line 4731 1     codepre  pSo my question is, am I looking at a Java bug here p  pAlso, the documentation mentions that you shouldnt assume that changing focus is done synchronously but it doesnt explain when its synchronous and when its not so what triggers the focus system in Java to handle certain focus requests asynchronously and others synchronouslyp  pEdit It could also be an event ordering thing. While looking at the focusedWindow in KeyboardFocusManager in the correct situation it goes like thisp  ol liMain frame  nullli liNull  dialogli liFocus change I expect to dialogli lidialog  nullli linull  Main frameli liFocus change to lastFocussedComponentli ol  pIn the failing situation its like thisp  ol liMain frame  nullli li4x Focus change to next focusable component on main frameli linull  Main frameli ol  pIt seems that the dialog is removed before it is actually shown. The event that clears the main frame as the active window is in both cases a WINDOWFOCUSLOST TimedWindowEvent with the dialog as opposite.p
Positive 4183 pIm still working on a little game and have some issues with focusing an object, in this case an imageView. I have a menu from which I switch towards the game by a button. I change the screen by changing the parent of my scene, which works smooth and well. Each parent has its own FXML file. In the game I move some object, now it is an imageView but Im open to suggestions here, over the screen. I want to center the screen on this object and move the screen with the object. As far as I read, this can be done by a focus.

Positive 4183 pI am experiencing some weird behavior when handling QML keyboard events. In this example, an object tree can be created, by selecting a tree element, the plus and minus keys should append and remove elements of the selected branch, and the spacebar should expand or contract the selected branch.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com8STQ3.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com8STQ3.png altenter image description hereap  pBut it doesnt work as expected. While plus and minus will work on the currently active element, the spacebar will always always expandcontract the root element regardless of which element is currently selected. Oddly enough, using the mouse right button works on the correct element as expected, achieving the desired behavior. Both the spacebar and the right mouse button use practically the same code, but for some reason, using spacebar always invokes the function of the root node, not on the one currently in focus, which should be receiving keyboard events.p  pHere is the relevant part of the codep  precodeUI      id ui     expanded true      UIList          model ui.proxy.model               Rectangle          width 50         height 50         color ui.activeFocus  red  darkred         MouseArea              anchors.fill parent             acceptedButtons Qt.LeftButton  Qt.RightButton             onClicked                  if mouse.button  Qt.LeftButton ui.forceActiveFocus                 else ui.expanded  ui.expanded                                 Keys.onPressed          switch event.key          case Qt.KeyPlus             ui.create             break         case Qt.KeyMinus             ui.pop             break         case Qt.KeySpace             ui.expanded  ui.expanded             break                codepre
