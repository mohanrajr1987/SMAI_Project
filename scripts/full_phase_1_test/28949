Positive 28949 pIm making a game where my character runs by touching the screen touchBegan, and stops when you let go touchEnd. p  pJumping is performed by swiping up the screen.p  pPretty simple and both actions work fine on their own. BUT while my character is running touch is being held by left thumb, the swipe up right thumb has no effect. touchBegan seems to be blocking the swipe gesture.p  pI have set multitouch to YES. p  pPreviously I had the game setup so the left half of the screen controlled running and the right half of the screen controlled the jumping by touch, but I need the jump to be controlled by a swipe. p

Positive 28949 pI am working on the following program, based on some a hrefhttppython.cocos2d.orgdocprogrammingguidequickstart.html relnofollowintroductory lessonsa in the cocos2d programming guide for 2d game design.p  pThe program has two classes, HelloWorld and KeyDisplay.  p  pHelloWorld displays the image of a bird and the phrase Get this bird some pizza.  The phrase is enlarged and shrunken every 2 seconds using codecocos.actions.ScaleBycode and codecocos.actions.Reversecode.  It works great.p  pKeyDisplay takes a user keyboard input and writes the character on the screen using an onkeypress function.  It is also working properly.p  pNext I would like to modify things going on in HelloWorld through KeyDisplay.  For example, I would like to change the scale of the image codesprite.scalecode or change the position of the image codesprite.positioncode.  This requires the HelloWorld and KeyDisplay class objects to talk to one another.  p  pUnfortunately, KeyDisplay class does not know about the HelloWorld class, and thus the variables are inaccessible.  For example, if I try to set sprite.scale  0.5 in the codeonkeypresscode function I get an error.  p  pIs there a way for KeyDisplay to respond to keypress events, modifying sprites and other variables in my HelloWorld class  I guess this is both a python programming question and a cocos2d game design question.  Generally I have needed to create the sprite and label inside of the HelloWorld class in the codeinitselfcode method.  I havent been allowed to create the sprite or label globally so far.

Positive 28949 pIve searched for an answer to this on Google and here. Ive found similar issues, but not this issue and no answer. Im also new to xCode and Apple development and Ive inherited this project after our Apple developer left.p  pThis is using cocos2d v0.99.4rc3, iOS 8.3, Xcode 6.3.2. Also, this worked on iOS 7.1 and before I upgraded xCode. I upgraded both xCode and the iOS on my iPad at the same time.p  pIn the code below, the backingWidth and backingHeight are set to 1536 and 2048 on an iPad Retina, but set to 0 on the iPad AIR.p  pWhen I call glGetError after renderbufferStorage is executed, 0x0501 GLINVALIDVALUE is returned on the AIR, but 0x0000 is returned on the Retina, so I think there is an issue with renderbufferStorage when layer is passed to it for the AIR. A call to glGetError after glBindRenderbufferOES is executed returns 0x0000 for both AIR and Retina. I have arm64, armv7, and armv7s listed for Valid Architectures in Build Settings but only armv7 and arm64 are shown in the first line that shows Architectures, right above Base SDK.p  precode BOOLresizeFromLayerCAEAGLLayer layer          Allocate color buffer backing based on the current layer size     glBindRenderbufferOESGLRENDERBUFFEROES, colorRenderbuffer     [context renderbufferStorageGLRENDERBUFFEROES fromDrawablelayer] This is fine on iPad Retina but causes error for AIR     GLenumerror  glGetError this returns 0x0501 GLINVALIDVALUEon the iPad AIR, but 0x0000 on the Retina.      glGetRenderbufferParameterivOESGLRENDERBUFFEROES, GLRENDERBUFFERWIDTHOES, ampbackingWidth equals 1536 on Retina, 0 on AIR     glGetRenderbufferParameterivOESGLRENDERBUFFEROES, GLRENDERBUFFERHEIGHTOES, ampbackingHeight equals 2048 on Retina, 0 on AIR      if glCheckFramebufferStatusOESGLFRAMEBUFFEROES  GLFRAMEBUFFERCOMPLETEOES this fails, so the resizeFromLayer returns NO.

One entry on here discussed destroying the frame buffer and then creating a new frame buffer inside of resizeFromLayer when they were getting a black screen, but that wasnt specific to the AIR. I havent tried that yet, but will and if it works, I will post that as a possible solution. Some comments on that solution said that it was mask for the real underlying problem, which is why Im asking this.p  pThe application code builds successfully on both Retina and AIR, but on the iPad and in the simulator, the AIR obviously shows a black screen, since something is failing in the resize. p
