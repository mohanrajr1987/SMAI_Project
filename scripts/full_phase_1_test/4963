Positive 4963 pI am attempting to resize a window from a Java application to span 8 connected monitors. All monitors are the exact same Dell monitor with 2560 X 1600 resolution each. The monitors are laid out so that there are 4 across and 2 down. This means that the total resolution across all 8 monitors is 10240 X 3200. However, no Java application seems capable of expanding past about 4096 X 3200. Since I know Java applications were able to scale across all 8 monitors before I updated the system to OSX, it makes me wonder if Java doesnt play nicely with OSX.p  pHas anyone experienced similar issues Anyone know how to fix it or if I canp  pstrongPrevious Findingsstrongp  ul liI know that the new OS has an options in System Preferences to make a multimonitor display continuous. I have already done this.li liThere are ways get the entire screen resolution dynamically in Java, which I found references to previously on StackOverflow. The original documentation is on java.awt.GraphicsConfiguration. While this seems to be able to determine what the total screen resolution should be and despite me using setBounds or setSize to make the application be that size, it will not work. I also tried statically inputting the desired dimensions and saw no difference than doing so dynamically. Even simple programs cannot be manually resized beyond the 4096 X 3200 size. Sample program code is provided below.li liI also know that OSX doesnt seem to like to have windows span multiple displays if the upper boundary of the window is moved too close to the top of a monitor or too close to the boundary between an upper monitor or a lower monitor. When this happens, OSX automatically scales the window so that it only takes up the hight of one monitor, and the window is placed at the top of the nearest monitor. This is not just with Java applications, but with any application and is simply how OSX operates. This also means that attempting to start an application that is higher than one screen will trigger this behavior as well. For my purposes right now, that is ok even though not preferable I just want to be able to span all 8 monitors, even if I have to manually resize the window.li liMy belief that this issue is only with Java applications is based on the fact that three separate Java applications including the sample one below have the same issue. However, other applications on the machine, like Google Chrome, seem to have no problem spanning all 8 monitors.li liBecause of the Dock at the bottom of one of the monitors and the menu at the top of another, I may not be able to get the full hight of 3200 pixels. Thats fine I just want to get as close to the 10240 X 3200 window size as possible. So, right now, the width is the real issue.li ul  pstrongSystem Detailsstrong OS OSX Yosemite 10.10.5, Processor 2X2.26 GHz QuadCore Intel Xeon, Memory 16 BG, Graphics NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 512 MBp  pstrongSample Java Programstrongp  precodeimport javax.swing.  class WindowTest extends JFrame    public WindowTest      setSize10240, 3200     setLocationRelativeTonull     setDefaultCloseOperationEXITONCLOSE       public static void main String[] args      WindowTest w  new WindowTest     w.setVisibletrue     codepre

Negative 4963 pIm developing a Windows Forms application in C with an embedded codeWebBrowsercode control to dummyproof i.e. disable context menus, back button, free navigation, etc. access to a thirdparty web application. p  pRight now Im trying to add the Zoom feature to my custom browser. I have the keyboard combos working for it CTRL  and CTRL  make the correct OLE calls to the underlying ActiveX WebBrowser object, but among the other frustrating things about codeWebBrowsercode Ive had to deal with, I cant seem to figure out how to capture CTRLMouse wheel to simulate the Zoom function like IE does. Ive looked everywhere to find a solution to this but to no avail.p  pTo try to figure it out, I created an empty form with just the WebBrowser control in it, and found the followingp  poL li CTRLMouseWheel always fires the codeMouseWheelcode event when the parent form has focus and the mouse cursor is hovering over the top of the window e.g. over the title of the application, or when the mouse cursor is hovering over the codeWebBrowsercode control when it does not appear to have focus even though the parent form has focus.li li CTRLMouseWheel never fires the codeMouseWheelcode event when the mouse cursor is hovering over the codeWebBrowsercode control and codeWebBrowsercode has focus, and there seems to be no effect.li li Using the mouse wheel without CTRL scrolls the window contents of codeWebBrowsercode but does not fire the codeMouseWheelcode event until the vertical scroll bar has fully reached either the top or the bottom. li Intercepting the codeMessagecode for codeWMMOUSEWHEELcode by overriding codeWndProccode and codeDefWndProccode both for a sample class inherited from codeWebBrowsercode and for the parent form applies only for the above conditions with codewParamcode properly denoting codeMKCONTROLcode.li li The codePreviewKeyDowncode event fires when CTRL is pressed, as expected, but still does nothing in unison with the mouse wheel.li olp  pSo I guess the codeMessagecode is being processed below the parent form and the managed control level and does not bubble up to where I can intercept or even handle it. Is there a way to do this, or some other way to simulate zooming in and out using CTRLMouseWheelp  pThanks for readingp

Negative 4963 pI have a client connecting to my server.  The client sends some messages to the server which I do not care about and do not want to waste time parsing its messages if Im not going to be using them.  All the io Im using is simple java io, not nio.p  pIf I create the input stream and just never read from it, can that buffer fill up and cause problems  If so, is there something I can do or a property I can set to have it just throw away data that it seesp  pNow what if the server doesnt create the input stream at all  Will that cause any problems on the clientsending sidep  pPlease let me know.p  pThanks, jbup
