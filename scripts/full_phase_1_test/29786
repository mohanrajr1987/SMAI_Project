Positive 29786 pSo I was working on a project that required me to work with some JSON, I was running into a few issues regarding the best way of representing things. First of, this is how the JSON looksp  precodephoneList [        phoneReason End of Contract,     phoneType [                id 5,         phoneType Android Smartphone             ]         ] codepre  pI want to know the most appropriate way of representing this.p  pFor example, I do know that that my phoneReason will just be a simple NSString while my phoneType is actually a NSArray. However,I wasnt sure how to represent athe id, I know this is an integer, but should this be an NSInteger or an NSNumber and bcould someone point me in the direction of some sample code where I can understand how to model a dictionary object containing an integer and a string and also where I can understand how to model an array of dictionaries.p  pMy other question is also similar in that say Im actually posting something, how do I model this, specifically say for like dictionary type JSON Curly Braceobjects that contain a numberinteger and a string.p  pFor example, this is the JSON Im trying to model and then do something like thisp  precodephoneReason Upgrade, phoneInfo    id 2 , codepre  pAnd then I want to pass IDp  precodevoid createOurRequestNSNumber id   NSDictionary myDictionary           phoneReason  [NSString stringWithFormati,   s  elf.dat.reason],       How do I then represent the phoneInfo element exactly  codepre  pSorry, for the clumsy question, would really appreciate any guidance on modeling JSON in iOS or just generally.p

Negative 29786 pI created a new pfx file for signing assemblies, using Visual Studios 2010 automated new option. I then copied it to another project  and it doesnt prompt me for a password. I checked, and the assembly emisem signed.p  pSo it seems that anyone who has the file can sign assemblies with it. Or is there a way to secure itp
Negative 29786 pIm starting a new job  my first  as a financial controller. The job will mean working a lot with excel files, for example formatting a document so that it can be imported and understood by other financial programs like SAP, or creating charts with the data in a document. There might be many specific tasks where vb.netvba can come useful so I would really to be good at it. p  pMy question is, should I do vb.net through visual studio or vba via Excel My understanding is that you can achieve basically the same things with both in terms of excelfiles, but perhaps vba is quicker and easier to learn and use. Vb.net on the other hand has a much better IDE through visual studio and learning it will give me a knowledge which can also be more useful elsewhere. Is this correct Instead of trying one of them only to find out after some time that I should have gone with the other, I hope to get it right from the start. p
