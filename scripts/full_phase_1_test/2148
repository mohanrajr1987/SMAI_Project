Positive 2148 pI use the SQL Developer to connect with Oracle.p  pI try to automate the rights, that means that I do not need all the time to type in every GRANT comment for every table and every user. So my idea was to make three tables. One owns the table names which exists in the database, and a tablegroup. One owns all the users and one the rights with rightgroups.p  pNow I try to automate it, to put it in one grant. Likep  precodeGRANT Select rights from DBRights where rightgroup  1     ON Select tables from DBTables where Tablegroup  1 to User codepre  pBut it didnt work. Where is my mistake Or isnt this possible Is there another option to automate itp
