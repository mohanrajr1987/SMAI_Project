That means that I can change, for example, 9 to be 50, but it wont be good because it was not a good path in the original array. The max sum path in this array 1  3  6  10, so i cant go to different cellsp  pMy problem is that I need this code to run with efficiency of On.p  pI tried to go from the last line and check every valid path that it can go, I tried to go all ways for the biggest number in each possibility. The first one isnt On efficiency and the second one can get the wrong answer.p  pI also tried to do it from the first row and to scan and compare all the steps, but again its not On efficiency.p  pstrongJust to make sure, Im not requesting anyone to write the code for me, just to help me figure out what is the best way to calculate it.strongp  pBTW, saw few comments and wanted to add that at the end, I need to print the maximum path sum, but not the path itself.p
