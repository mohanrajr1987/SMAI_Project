Positive 3716 pI feel like I am missing something super small but I cannot figure it out. I am talking to a measurement device with my computer. I am telling the measurement device to measure and then send a retrieve measurement command to the device. In order to read that measurement into my computer, I use com1.readExisting. However, it does not return any measurement. Even when I run the debugger step by step it says com1.readExisting  . I finally decided to try tera term to see if I could get it working. As soon as I opened a connection to my measurement device, the measurement showed up on the tera term terminal from the test I had just ran in Visual Studios. p  pSo I am sending data to the measurement device, and the measurement device is sending data back, but I am not able to read in the measurement with com1.readExisting. p  pWhy cant I read the data back into my computerp  pThanks in advancep

Positive 3716 pHello friends have a form in C  that reads data from a serial device connected, my problem is that I even changing form of the method myPort.DataReceived still running and receiving data. Theres no way I close the connection with the serial port because the method does not stop excutar. Ive tried a command to zip it when I change my form but it crashes when you try to run the myPort.Close, I believe that is why the myPort.DataReceived still running, so I removed the code and it continues myPort.Close open in another form.
