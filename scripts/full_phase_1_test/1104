Negative 1104 pSay for example, an element is referenced from multiple maps, e.g. a map name to element, a map address to element and a map age to element. Now one looks up the element for example via name, and now wishes to delete it from all three mapsp  pSeveral solutions come to mindp  p1 The most straight forward. Look up the element in the name to element map, then search both other maps to find the element in those, then remove the element entry in all three.p  p2 Store weak pointers in all three maps. Store a shared pointer somewhere, at best maybe even in the element itself. After finding the element in one map, delete the element. When trying to access the element from the other maps and realizing the weak pointers cant be converted to shared pointers, remove the entry.p  p3 Use intrusive maps. This has the advantage that one does not need to search the remaining maps to find the element in those. However, as the object is stored in several maps, the element itself cant be made intrusive  rather the element might need to have a member implementing the hooks.p  p4 Othersp  pIs there a very clean nice solution to this I have been bumping into this problem a few times...p  pA few thoughts. Solution 1 is typically the one that ends up being implemented naturally as a project grows. If the element itself has the key information of the other maps, and other containers are maps, this is probably quite acceptable. However, if the keys are missing, or if the container is e.g. a list, it can become very slow. Solution 2 depends on the implementation of weak pointers, and might also end up being quite slow. Solution 3 seems best, but maybe somewhat complicatedp

Negative 1104 pIm looking for an all round solution for making video calls with multiple users at the same time, screen sharing on the same moment when making a videoaudio call, 3D navigationwalking to a destination while following an arrow on the screen and push notifications. I want to build a crossplatform webapplication with all these functions. My first idea was to build a webapplication. But I then had to use webRTC, which is not supported in all major browsers andor operating systems.p  pI searched for a solution, but I think its really confusing and all the solutions that I found were platform specific and had most of the time limitations. Does someone know a waypartypluginservice or a combination to achieve this My idea was to use PhoneGap to make my application crossplatform. But I dont think I can develop all those functions with PhoneGap. Could someone please advise me I looked into WebRTC but Im not sure which functions are available in which OS in combination with PhoneGap. My research gave me an understanding that most servicescompaniesplugins are not available for Windows Phone. I definitely dont want to reinvent the wheel. I dont have any experience with PhoneGap. But from what Ive read, it looks very promising.  Should I create a WebRTC server for handling multiple connections Or should I connect third parties to solve this Such as PubNub or FlashPhoner Or is a WebRTC server not required  Thank you in advance for your helpp
Negative 1104 pI came across this topic today while investigating something very strange. Doing certain things in our Flex app can cause the number of frames rendered to rocket, from 12fps to 30fps loaded animations start playing at high speed and the GUI starts to lock up.p  pSince everything Ive read on FlexFlash hammers home the point the frame rate is capped at the fps set in the top level app, it seems the only way these extra renders can be happening is due to some events causing them no programmatic changes to the stages framerate are done anywhere. Since it only happens when I put my update logic in the ENTERFRAME handler, Im trying to figure out what might be happening which to apparently causing Flex to go rendercrazy.p  pHypothesis something in my update function is triggering an immediate screen update, this raises another ENTERFRAME immediately, which means my update loop gets called, which triggers another immediate screen update, ...p  pWe have Flex components used in our GUI, if this is a factor. I dont really know where to go next on this.p  pstrongClarificationsstrongp  ul liWhen I say things speed up, there are two ways this manifests.li liFirstly, my ENTERFRAME handler gets called far more often.li liSecondly, a loaded Flash SWF with a looping animation built in suddenly speeds up to te point it looks silly.li liI am not using updateAfterEvent, I only found this existed when researching this problem. Apparently, some events on Sprite subclasses automatically call this and I wonder if thats the root cause.li liI am not doing any direct messsing about with rendering at all. Background animations play automatically as they have timelines builtin from CS3 authoring, all our update function does is change the position of DisPlayObjects or addremove them etcli ul  pstrongUpdatestrong I added a label to my app to print out stage.frameRate, and discovered at certain times, it suddenly changes from 12 to 1000 the maximum allowed value. While it was trivial to add a line to my ENTERFRAME handler to reset it thats hardly a big help. Also, even doing this, the rendering is all messed up. Certain actions like raising an Alert popup make it all spring back into life. Unfortunately, I am not able to view the source of the Stage class to set a breakpoint on the setter property.p  pThats very interesting about the Flex loading set to 1000fps thing. What we have are several Flex applications which all provide a common interface. A master app is in charge of loading these modules as required through the SWFLoader class. However, the loading process already takes into account the delayed loading... when the SWF loads we then wait for the APPLICATIONCOMPLETE from the SystemManager. Once this is received, shouldnt the applications completion have occurredp
