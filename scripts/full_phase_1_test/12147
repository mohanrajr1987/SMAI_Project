Positive 12147 pSo ive come across a slight issue with Lists in Cp  pI have a List that has some very similar dates. Now what i need to do is remove duplicates but where a duplicate is if its within one minute of another time, so not exactly the same.

Negative 12147 pI have a ExtJs application. When user needs to view PDF report generated on the server side I open a new link using codewindow.opencode function. I pass URL for service that provides PDF file stored on the web server. p  pThis function is called from two different places user can scroll list of reports and click toolbar button on one of them and see the report, or user can execute report, wait till it generated and then application will automatically present it. The only difference between two scenarios  second one is async and the last step where report is open is called from callback functions. p  pBut these two cases behave differently. First one  will open new tab in Chrome, and in Safari and this will not be considered a codepopupcode window. In second case  it will be opened in new window in the same browsers of course  so the configuration is exactly same. p  pIm stuck to figure out why the behavior is different. p  pAny ideap  pUpdate To clarify  both are JS calls. one is something likep  precodebuttonClick function     window.openmyreporturl  codepre  pother is a bit more complicated but at the endp  precoderunReport function     store.onload, function        window.openmyreporturl        store.load  codepre  pUpdate2 I was able to figure out whats going on.

If I put a 5 sec delay for the same button click event handler  it gets treated as new window.p  pDoes it make sense to anybody p
Negative 12147 pI am rendering complex 3d objects.  Here is a simple example with a spherelike objectp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comAmlB9.png altenter image description herep  pNext I am applying a clipping plane to these objects and rendering a texture on this plane, giving the impression you are looking at the inside of the object, as if it was sliced.  For examplep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com18aOW.png altenter image description herep  pThe problem is the jagged edge of the texture.  It will stick out passed the boundary of the surface.  Heres another angle where you can see it sticking out.  The surface and the texture both derive from the same source data, but the surface is smoothed and has a higher resolution than the texture.p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comd0Ci5.png altenter image description herep  pWhat I want is to be able to somehow clip the texture, so that it never sticks out past the boundary of the surface.  Also, I dont want to simply scale down the texture, since although this might prevent it from sticking outside, it would create interior gaps between the texture edge and the surface edge.  I would rather the texture be a little too big and have it clipped so that it strongsits flush against the edge of the surfacestrong.p  pHeres where I amp  pI figured the first step would be to define the intersection of the plane and the surface.  So now I have that, as an ordered list of line segments.  However, Im not sure how to proceed with this info or if this is even the best approach.p  pIve been reading up on stencil buffers.  One approach might be to turn the intersection line into a 2d shape and draw this into a stencil buffer.  Then apply this when drawing the texture. Although I think its a lot of work since the shapes can be complicated.p  pI am wondering if I can somehow use the already drawn surface in conjunction with a stencil buffer or some other technique to somehow strongclip the texturestrong  without having to go through the extra trouble of deriving the intersection line, etc.p  pWhats the best approach here  Any online examples you can point me to would also be really helpful.p

Negative 12147 pHow would I go about creating a table that is linked to a specific user that can be edited by that user Basically a user would log in, and they would see a button that took them to a page with a bunch of specifically labeled input boxes. They could put the appropriate data into the boxes and save it. There should also be a drop down menu that contains presets for the data. At first I thought to use a database, but heres the kicker They need to be able to add and delete input boxes. To recap, the user needs to have their own specific page that allows them to change data in input boxes, as well as add more fields if they require it. This all needs to be stored and linked to their user. How can I do thisp
