Positive 5382 pI am using Pyplot in Python.p  pI know that you can pick and choose which points in particular you wish to remove, but this also affects the axis which I want to keep constant. Also, the points I generate are dynamically created meaning I do not know what they are until they are actually made. Is there a method in a while I can basically wipe all the points of the graph but keep the same axis Id rather not have Python close the old window and create a new one.p  pThanks for you help Let me know what I need to clarify.p

Positive 5382 pI want to prove some facts about imperative objectoriented program. How can I represent a heterogeneous object graph in Coq My main problem is that edges are implicit  each node consists of an integer label modelling object address and a data structure that models object state. So implicit edges are formed by fields inside data structure that model object pointers and contain address label of another node in a graph. To ensure that my graph is valid, adding new node to the graph must require a proof that all fields in a data structure that is being added refer to nodes that already exist in the graph. But how can I express all pointer fields in a data structure in Coqp
