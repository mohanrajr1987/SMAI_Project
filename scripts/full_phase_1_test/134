Positive 134 pAssume that I have an array like sop  precodevar a  [94, Neptunium, 2, Helium, null, Hypotheticalium, 64, Promethium] codepre  pEvennumbered array indices are linked with the following odd index. In other words, 94 goes with Neputunium and 2 goes with Helium etc. How can I sort the array based on the evennumbered indices but keep the following oddindexed value after it So that I end up with an array like sop  precodea  [null, Hypotheticalium, 2, Helium, 64, Promethium, 94, Neptunium] codepre  pstrongNOTEstrong And yes, I do know that know that using an object or ES6 Map or even, in this case, a sparse array with the numbers as indices, if null is left out would be much more appropriate, but Im just exploring this to experiment with the language. Thanks for any help.p

The validation fails as we expect it should.p  pThe question then is this How can I access the parent codeProjectcode instance inside the codevalidatecode block  Since Im calling codeproject.phrases.createcode Im explicitly saying create a new codePhrasecode as a child of this specific parent codeProjectcode.  Is there any way to access it  ActiveRecord associations provide an codeownercode method, but its not available inside codevalidatecode as far as I can tell.p  pThanks in advancep

Negative 134 pSo this question has two parts, which I think may be related, and its mostly abstract. Briefly, heres what Im doing p  pI have a codeJFramecode with a codeJPanelcode and some codechildcode codeJPanelscode each with 3 codeJButtonscode on it. I also created a codeJComponentcode called codeglassPanelcode for the codeJFramecode  i.e. codemyJFrame.setGlassPaneglassPanelcode, that allows me to paint over the JPanels and buttons.p  p1 Essentially triggered by clicking all 3 buttons on a codeJPanelcode, codeglassPanelcode is set to codeVisiblecode which appears to then call codepaintComponentcode. This is relates to the first question. p  p2 In codepaintComponentcode I draw and paint rectangles and images, using a a hrefhttpwww.cs.tut.filintulamanualjavatutorialuiswingpaintingoverview.html relnofollowdouble buffera, onto codeglassPanelcode. This is relates to the second question.p  pHeres my relevant GlassPanel class code this is not an SSCCE because it is an abstract question for nowp  precodeimport java.awt.BasicStroke import java.awt.Color import java.awt.Graphics import java.awt.Graphics2D import java.awt.geom.Line2D import javax.swing.JComponent   public class GlassPanel extends JComponent        Override      protected void paintComponentGraphics g          super.paintComponentg         setDoubleBufferedtrue         Graphics2D g2  Graphics2D g          g2.drawRectx,y,width,height         g2.fillRectx,y,width,height          g2.drawImageimg, x, y, this       codepre  pBy placing a codeSystem.out.printcode statement inside the paintComponent method, I could tell strongit was being called continuously and also asynchronouslystrong. For how I think the call is made, see 1. Also, lets say Im absolutely certain there is no call to coderepaintcode anywhere in the code Ive checked many, many times. This is the basis of the first question.p  pThe first time I click 3 buttons, all goes smoothly. The rectangle and images are both drawn immediately. However, when I click the next 3 buttons at this point, codeglassPanelcode has already been codesetVisibletruecode and the first rectangle and image are still on the screen, painted over the first 3 buttons, the second rectangle and image strongonly load partiallystrong. When I click away from the codeJFramecode and onto the Eclipse window that Ive run the program from, the number of calls to codepaintComponentcode rapidly increases by the same amount each time AND strongthe partially loaded images and rectangles immediately and completely show up in the background codeJFramecodestrong. When I click back to the JFrame, the number of calls goes up again by an exact amount. This is the basis of the second question. p  pUPDATE a hrefhttpwww.cs.tut.filintulamanualjavatutorialuiswingpaintingoverview.html relnofollowHeresa something I readp  blockquote   pAlso, when the GUI is covered by another window and then becomes   uncovered, the painting system invokes the paintComponent method with   the painting area equal to the newly uncovered area.p blockquote  pMy questions are p  p1 why might codepaintComponentcode be called so much without a coderepaintcode Or, a similar question, what might be calling paintComponent p  pUPDATE After doing a little math, I strongly believe that its being called by every component all buttons and panels continuously. But still, no call to repaint...p  p2 Why are the images loaded partially until i take focus from the JFrame windowp  pNote that I have tried many things a creating my own doubleBuffer and using no double buffer I know its mostly for animation, b overriding and not overriding codepaintComponentcode, c drawing and not drawing the image the rectangle still takes time to load, d making absolutely sure there was no coderepaintcode, e using and not using codeSwingUtilities.invokeLaternew Runnable              public void run  stuffcode, f done an codeifcode statement to only setVisibletrue once. p  pI can try and past the SSCCE if I must, but I do think these are more abstract. Thanksp
