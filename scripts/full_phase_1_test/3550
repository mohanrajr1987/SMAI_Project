Positive 3550 pMost of the popular NoSQL databases MongoDB, RethinkDB do not support ACID transactions. They are very popular today within developers of different systems. p  pThe problem is how to guarantee data consistence without transactions I thought that data consistency is one of the main things in production. Am I wrong Maybe there is some technics to restore data consistencyp  pIm now want to use RethinkDB for my project, but Im scare about missed transactions.p
Positive 3550 pI have an app built on CakePhp. Have 4 environments for app  local, testing, acceptance and production. Suddenly on only one of them of course its production I started getting problems with transactions. The error I get isp  precodeThere is already an active transaction 0 ...libCakeModelDatasourceDboSource.php2294 PDOgtbeginTransaction 1 ...libCakeModelModel.php1749 DboSourcegtbegin 2 ...appModelAppModel.php499 ModelgtsaveArray, true, Array ..... codepre  pMySQL versions and settings seem to be identically on all environments, maybe the only difference its emmaxconnectionsem. Also recently we didnt have CakePhp framework update, and app code is the same on environments.p  pDebug shows me that there are 2 BEGIN transactions call in a row during script execution, but as official MySQL doc saysp  blockquote   pTransactions cannot be nested. This is a consequence of the implicit   commit performed for any current transaction when you issue a START   TRANSACTION statement or one of its synonyms.p blockquote  pso I suppose it should not be a problem, plus on all environments there are the same 2 BEGIN, and everything just works fine there.p  pSomething tells me that if everything is ok on 3 of 4 environments, the reason is in environment, but I have no idea what it can be, and google doesnt say to much about.p  pWhat can be the reason, where I should look forp
Positive 3550 pFirst of all, i already did lot of googling for this and found few solutions,but nothing is satisfactoryp  pSo here is the situation, I have few components running on diffrent physical server which involves database and jms both these are the springs codeDefaultMessageListenerContainercode and message passing architecture. When one component is sending message to another component via jms, on next component it cant read data from database because privious component havent commited data to database.p  pif i keep cacheLevelCACHECONNECTION and pass the external codeDataSourceTransactionManagercode everything works fine but with penalty of performance, I want to keep cacheLevelCACHESESSION for speed but i face above problem, did anybody faced same problemp  pI found codeChainedTransactionManagercode from springdata but its having heavy penalty on performace. can abyone know how to achive performace and multitransaction management bothp

Positive 3550 pI have a structure set up with multiple service calls to a WCF service on a server. I have multiple DbContexts instantiated per call. I would like to group some of these calls into a single transaction on the server, while excluding other calls that might occur in the mean time. Is this possible p  pMy contexts are all managed within a single application on a single server and all contexts use the same connection string. p  pI am looking for something likep  precodevar transKey  transService.BeginTransaction  creates a transaction of some kind. service1.ExecutetransKey  on the server places the execution within the specified transaction. service2.ExecutetransKey  same here transService.CommitTransactiontransKey  Nothing happens until now allowing other clients to freely utilize service1 without touching the transaction, the transaction occurs, and everything gets cleaned up. codepre  pBut I may barking up the wrong tree so to speak. Any help in finding a solution to this problem would be useful.p  pEDITp  pWhat I am wanting to do is have a specified transaction that spans multiple service calls, but not every service call. I am looking for a mechanism to create a transaction, then decide I want this DbContext action and this other DbConext action, but not this DbContext action part of the transaction. Then have the liberty to hold that transaction until I am ready to execute it. TransactionScope I believe does not give me that kind of control.p  pI may be wrong but TransactionScope appears to create a single transaction per connection, and any and every DbContext action gets rolled up into the transaction as long as the scope is alive. I need more control over what goes into such and such a transaction.p
