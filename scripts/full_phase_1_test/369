Positive 369 pI am working on building a Zend Framework 2 ZF2 website using Doctrine2 DBALORM, where I develop equally on Windows and Mac, sometimes Linux Ubuntu I like the allaround experience.p  pIn codecomposer.jsoncode I have the following versionsp  ul lidoctrinedoctrineormmodule 0.9.1li lizendframeworkzendframework 2.3.2,lt3.0.0li ul  pAt first, my website ran fine on all three environments using XAMPP Apache 2.4.16, MySQL 5.0.11, and PHP 5.6.12. But suddenly, after I performed some changes on Windows and pulled those changes from GitHub to my Mac computer, Doctrine started failing with the following exception messagep  precodeAn exception was raised while creating DoctrineORMEntityManager no instance returned codepre  pI got this exception a lot while configuring Doctrine2 in ZF2. But once I was done, things just worked. That is until it broke on Mac, only It still works fine on Windows.p  pI have cleared the cache completely coderm datacachecode and I have verified the integrity of my configuration files.

So what happensp  pWhen I check the cached configuration file, codedatacachemoduleconfigcache.application.config.cache.phpcode, on my Mac, the database login informations are incorrect, having the following valuesp  precode ... array      host gt localhost,     port gt 3306,     user gt username,     password gt password,     dbname gt database, ,  ... codepre  pObviously these are wrong. But how can ZF2 suddenly generate incorrect configurations on Macp  pI even tried checkout out previous commits from Git on my Mac, which I know worked for certain. But the same problem occurs. The only difference, I suspect might have influence on this behavior, is that I ran codecomposer.phar updatecode, which mightve changed the versions of ZF2 andor Doctrine2.p
