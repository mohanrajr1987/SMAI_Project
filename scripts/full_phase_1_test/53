Positive 53 pI did something bad, I think. I am a big git noob first of all. By using Eclipse I hope to ignore writing git commands by hand. The issue occurred when I needed to revert changes on a xmlfile so I hoped to checkout original file from local repo. Without reading much about git plugin I just wanted to follow common sense and so I pressed context menu Checkoutbutton under Historytab in Eclipse cannot show you a pic since stackoverflow requires 10 reputation points for posting a pic. After pressing Checkout I pressed Resetbutton and now I am not able to commit changes to local repo even though I can see changed and new files by running git status. If I try running git commit m  I get the msg that there is nothing to commit.p  pPls helpbr Kind regardsbr A.H.p

Positive 53 pI have been trying to fix this problem for several hours now, and I am totally at my wits end.p  pMy old computer crashed, but luckily I was able to recover most of my files. I installed eclipse on my desktop, and attempted to import a few projects into eclipse. Every one of them had problems, and not a single one will run. I am running Windows 7 on a homebuild PC I am 99 sure this is not a hardware problem, I dont think you need specs.p  pFirst, every time I import I have followed a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13422683eclipsenotrecognizingstringsandclassesthis threada because it is the first of my problems every time I import a project, eclipse will not recognize anything from java and I apparently need to manually tell it what to use which is annoying, and if anyone has a fix for this it would be great to know how to stop it.p  pBut the big problem comes after I fix that. Whenever I try to run the project, no matter which project it is I get the error I copied in the description p  precodeException in thread main java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError MainMethod  Unsupported major.minor version 52.0 at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass1Native Method at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClassUnknown Source at java.security.SecureClassLoader.defineClassUnknown Source at java.net.URLClassLoader.defineClassUnknown Source at java.net.URLClassLoader.access100Unknown Source at java.net.URLClassLoader1.runUnknown Source at java.net.URLClassLoader1.runUnknown Source at java.security.AccessController.doPrivilegedNative Method at java.net.URLClassLoader.findClassUnknown Source at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassUnknown Source at sun.misc.LauncherAppClassLoader.loadClassUnknown Source at java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClassUnknown Source at sun.launcher.LauncherHelper.checkAndLoadMainUnknown Source codepre  pI have tried just about everything, and am getting pretty close to just breaking the whole thing.

All of them say to do the same thing change the project preferences and check the compiler settings. The settings should match.p  pI am running JDK7 and JRE7. JRE8JDK8 is not installed anywhere on my desktop I am not sure why eclipse seems to think it is. My question is this how do I fix this problem Do I need to do a clean install and follow a specific set of steps to stop this from happening Do I need to put JDK8 on my computer Do I need ro reimport the projects into the workspace in a specific way Am I just stuckp
Positive 53 pI have a simple program, its supposed to print to the console, a public static variable. In the program, this variable is incremented, and then ultimately printed. Now here is the thing, in eclipse, the output shows that the variable has been incremented, but when I copy this same program to a folder on my desktop package names within class files are adjusted of course the program runs fine, but the this static variable, when printed, is 0. When run in eclipse, this program prints out the correct output, a long, lets say 500.p  pCan anyone think of a reason this might be, assuming that all else is correct, does anyone know of any restrictions that output to a console might have p

Negative 53 pIm working on a project with JSF and Im not an expert, so Im asking for some guidance here.p  pWere using templates, and we have some tables in the views with a onRowSelect event that has a listener and an Ajax call with codeupdateformcodep  pThats working fine, it refreshes some divs in the view and shows new info, but Im trying to do exactly the same from a component, and its working absolutely different.p  pIn that component, I have some filters, and a button that says Filter. It had same ajax but codeformcode was not recognized, so I had to put some IDs and call codeupdateworkspacecode, and its doing the refresh fine.p  pIssue here is that, its reinstantiating the codeViewScopedcode Bean, so filters changes I made are not reflected in the view. If I move the variables to Session, it works, but following the architecture those variables should be in View.p  pFun thing is, If I make the changes in the filters, but instead of clicking the button Filter, I click a row in the Table, whole form gets refreshed and changes in filters are kept.
