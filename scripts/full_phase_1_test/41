Positive 41 pI am making an application in Visual Basic and am wanting to format a list of flash drives connected to the computer. In order to do this, I am defining a process and using command prompt arguments, but some of the flash drives I am using are detected as fixed disks and not removable. Command prompt does not appear to work with these fixed drives, and just indefinitely attempts to format them. If I only connect flash drives that are detected as removable, the program functions normally. Here is the code I currently have to do this.p  precodeFormatStartInfo.FileName  format.com             FormatStartInfo.Arguments  drivesj amp Q FSNTFS V amp formattedDate             FormatStartInfo.RedirectStandardInput  True             FormatStartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput  True             FormatStartInfo.UseShellExecute  False             FormatStartInfo.CreateNoWindow  True             BeginFormat.StartInfo  FormatStartInfo             BeginFormat.Start             Dim SW As System.IO.StreamWriter  BeginFormat.StandardInput             SW.WriteLine             BeginFormat.WaitForExit         Next codepre  pIs there a better way to accomplish this Or is there some utility that will change these flash drives so they are no longer detected as fixed Based on my research this is something that is built into the firmware that cannot be changed.p

Positive 41 pIm aware there are other questions similar to this, but I havent found an answer that works for me. I have a program that writes an excel report for sales by month. It works fine when given a date range less than three years, but when I input a date range larger I get this error. Using breakpoints I discovered the error occurs in this portion of codep  precodeFor iColl  iReportCollumns  2 To MaxY     xlApp.Cellsx, iColl  SUM amp GetColumnNameiColl amp x  1 amp  amp GetColumnNameiColl amp x  iRowsPerRecord amp  Next iColl codepre  pSince this is for work, Im not able to reveal a lot of the code so Ill try to explain in good enough detail whats going on here. If you need more code, let me know and Ill see what I can release. The report has locations which each have multiple but the same sale types. For each sale type the report displays by month the total sales.p  pSo sales are grouped at the highest level into locations, with sub groups for each sale type, these are displayed as separate rows of the spreadsheet. The months are the columns of the spreadsheet. iReportCollumns  2 represents basic information that is displayed for each location, so that the sales data starts in the columns after this. iColl represents the current column, iRowsPerRecord represents the number of sale types. In my test case there are three rows per record, five years for a total of 60 months, and iReportCollumns  9, so there are a total of 71 columns per row. MaxY represents the number of columns per row, so 71 in this case. This bit of code creates a totals row for each location. I have two locations in my test case so that there are 6 rows of data and 2 rows of totals. The totals rows come before the data rows for each location.p  pStepping through this for loop, I discovered that it stops when iColl  52 while it is still working on the first totals row. So it is not even getting to the data rows before I get this error. However it does insert the column names for all of the columns, but it breaks once it tries to write the sum formulas. Is there some limit to how many columns I can insert into an excel sheet p  pMy alternative solution is to just limit it to only show a maximum of 24 months per report, which works for other similar reports. That solution is okay, but Id rather allow the user to choose a larger date range if they so please.p
