Positive 601 pI have a cron job that launches an Rscript to go fetch some data and stash it away in a database.  Sometimes the source isnt ready so it waits.  Sometimes the source skips a data point so the script ends up waiting until another instance is started from cron.  Now that two instances are running they cause problems with each other.  Is there something like the following pseudo code that I could put at the top of my scripts so they stop when they see another instance of themselves is already running p  pcodestopifnotSys.runningnameofscript.rcodep  pOne thing I thought to do would be for the script to make a temp file with a fixed name at the start and then delete that temp file at the end.  This way the script can check for the existence of the file to know if its already running.  I also see theres something called codeflockcode which is probably a better solution than that but Id prefer if there was a way R can do it without bash commands Ive never really learned any bash.  If there isnt a pure R way to do this, can the R script call flock on itself or would it only work if the cron task calls a bash script that then calls the rscript.  If it isnt already obvious, I dont really know how to use flock.p

Negative 601 pI routinely use PyDev in Eclipse for Python development.  However, Im trying PyQt for the first time in the same environment.  It works well, with one exception.  If the program errors out anywhere within the Qt main event loop, including within my own code, no error information is output to the PyDev console.p  pTo demonstrate this I created the following simple PyQt appp  precodeimport sys from PyQt5 import uic from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication   test.ui contains a single Push Button named pushButton base, form  uic.loadUiType..uitest.ui   class MainWindowbase, form     def initself, parentNone         superbase, self.initparent         self.setupUiself         self.pushButton.clicked.connectself.buttonpressed      def buttonpressedself         printbutton pressed         printinvalidvariable  intentional error         pass  if name  main     app  QApplicationsys.argv     app.setStylefusion     mainwindow  MainWindow     mainwindow.show     sys.exitapp.exec codepre  pIf I place an intentional error such as codeprintinvalidvariablecode anywhere after codeif name  maincode and before the codeapp.execcode command, the program properly terminates with a traceback and the expected codeNameError name invalidvariable is not definedcode.  However, if I press the button in my dialog using the above code, codebutton pressedcode appears on the console but then the application terminates silently and with no error information in the console.  Other debugging operations, such as breakpoints and expressions, work fine.p  pIs this expected behavior  If so, what do you recommend for facilitating debugging of PyQt apps in this environment.  If not, Id appreciate insight into what I need to do to rectify the problem.p  ul liPython version python3.4.3.amd64 li liPyDev version PyDev for Eclipse 4.3.0.201508182223 li liPyQt version PyQt55.5gplPy3.4Qt5.5.0x64li ul  hr  pUpdate strong20150930strongp  pWhen I run the test app directly with python.exe, it outputs the error correctly to strongstderrstrong in both error scenarios.  So this issue does seem specific to the PyDev environment.  I additionally created an entirely fresh Eclipse workspace with only the Python interpreter configured and ran my test again on a freshly created PyDev project using the same source code.  The results were the same.p

Negative 601 pI have a questionconcern regarding implementation styles used by some Java frameworks. p  pFirst, as a general background, I know from handson that creating arrays of Objects are way much more expensive than creating rawprimitive array types. For example, if you ask some layer below for a large chunk of character data, the most efficient choice is using types like char[], byte[], ByteArray, rather than inventing wrapper datatypes and returning array of objects.p  pHowever, I have seen frameworks out there which seem to implement their own data types, and expect arrays of those types to be passed back and forth. This incurs all of the mentioned performance and cost issues, and is really inconvenient due to the conversion code overhead. p  pFor example, consider the types defined in sblim clients javax.cim packagep  pa hrefhttpsblim.sourceforge.netcimclient2v22docjavaxcimpackagesummary.html relnofollowhttpsblim.sourceforge.netcimclient2v22docjavaxcimpackagesummary.htmlap  pTheres one type named UnsignedInteger8 which is basically a byte. There are other types which would also have equivalent efficient primitive types. Theres a comment about DMTF data types which seem to indicate they are encapsulating the different datatypes in Java classes in order to comply with the protocol, but at which costp  pSo, to get to the point, I want to know if someone more experienced with Java performance and framework design in general can provide some feedback on whether sblim client is an efficient implementation or not. Is there a rationale or justification for using this wrapper types like UnsignedInteger8 when they could simply have used a byte or char Do creating standardized and uniform code for handling all DMTF data types justify the lack in performance that implies using array of objects instead of primitive types Am I getting the point right or wrong herep  pThanks in advancep  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pTo further show my point, consider this excerptp  precodestatic StringBuilder convertToText UnsignedInteger8[] u8arr      if u8arr null return null     StringBuilder sb  new StringBuilderu8arr.length     for UnsignedInteger8 u8  u8arr                 sb.appendcharu8.shortValue          return sb  codepre  pI would have to use code like that to map a chunk of character data to a StringBuilder. This is really inefficient, as the data is already loaded inmemory by CIM. Why should I need to create a new StringBuilder and iteratecopy over all data again Why cant CIM client just provide a String, byte[], char[], or ByteBuffer I believe this is very inefficient and I would like to understand why in this world would they implemented it this way.p  pI understand the advantages of abstracting data types and using facilities provided by Java, such as Comparable, Equals, the Collections API, and so forth. This makes sense and I believe is worth using for complex structured data, such as Person, Account, Transaction, etc. but not for rawprimitive data types. It is just too much.p

Negative 601 pIf you have a C project that has a bunch of .ODL files emandem the generated .h files from the ODL compiler, should doxygen be told to parse both .odl and .h, or only one or the other In general I dont like documenting generated code but IDL is sort of a special case.p  pIn any case, it seems like the member listing of ODL files is not quite working properly in my tests, are ODL files properly parsedp
