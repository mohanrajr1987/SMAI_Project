Negative 519 pIn the past times, we use coredata as a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiosdocumentationcocoaconceptualCoreDataArticlescdConcurrency.htmlapplerefdocuidTP40003385SW1 relnofollowApple aska, one codeNSManagedObjectContextcode per thread, use codeNSNotificationCentercode to observe the codeNSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotificationcode, then merge changes back. Apple show us the right way in its a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibraryiossamplecodeThreadedCoreDataIntroductionIntro.html relnofollowsample codea. p  pHow ever, its a little verbose, you must write a bunch of code to make it work.iOS 5 was shipped with the new method codeperformBlockcode and codeperformBlockAndWaitcode for codeNSManagedObjectContextcode. Now its possible to pass a single codeNSManagedObjectContextcode to all threads, and use codeperformBlockcode or codeperformBlockAndWaitcode to wrap all coredata related code, it should be much more easier and less headache, yet people seems didt talk about this new way a lot, even Apple itself, the Concurrency with Core Data chapter of iOS documentation  and ThreadedCoreData sample code still recommend one codeNSManagedObjectContextcode per thread.p  pSo Im wondering, is there any downside for codeperformBlockAndWaitcode makes people dont use it Or the new way I said is just a bad designp
