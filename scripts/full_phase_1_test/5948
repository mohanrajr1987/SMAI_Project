Positive 5948 pIm a starter in Arduino and C and I got a data set from my arduino which i try to analyze using c and some coding math.p  pThe problem i have is this. It are measurements of real data it represents a sloped line up or down the angle of this slope is not exact the same for all measurement samples. so its a bit like a line drawn by a young child. However.. and this is the part i need to detect, sometimes i have data samples that are much more straight up.. like an apartment on a roof of a house.p  pea p  precode     1.0002      2.0301      3.023      4.002    if this happens for more then 4 samples      4.005     i need to detect it      4.700         4.300    or i perhaps check if it happens more then 10 samples      4.011    but for the sample ill use 4 here      4.910      5.011    the slope here is close to  yx1      6.145    but ive seen yx0.2 as well and other slopes.      7.001    i just cant asume its x1 codepre  pI wonder how to tackle this measurement feature. Im using c here and not arduino c since i want to put it on screen.p  pi was thinkingp  precode   Mx is my measurement  for x  0x lt endoflinex    slope  M[x]M[x1]M[x2]M[x3]  4  distance  absM[x]slopeabsM[x1]slopeabsM[x2]            absM[x3]absM[x4]  if distance lt 1  detected                        but should this be lt1                         outputdetected at   x4                        codepre  pIm not realy sure if this is the correct fast way to do this, or that this might give me false positives.p

Positive 5948 pI have been working with my arduino Uno on Ubuntu Linux It wont work on Windows with my laptop. For a few days it worked fine, but recently I have been working with the Serial Port. It was all good, until the Serial Monitor stopped opening. It would have a process open, and using alttab it would show the window for it, but I couldnt get it to show normally or be interacted with in any way. I have opened it going toolsSerial Monitor, ctrlshiftm, and the button for it. I can upload fine. I cant find the dynamic IP address for the arduino, or for just fun remotely interacting with it.p

Negative 5948 pOn PocketPC, when you tap the X to close the application, it stays open in the background.

Negative 5948 pIve got an update panel with a repeater and some fields. When a user fills out the details on the fields it populates a collection I keep in the Viewstate which is then bound to the repeater.p  pSo the updatepanel updates and the repeater now contains the new item the values for which the user just filled out in the form.p  pIve also got an edit button as part of that repeater which, when clicked, populates the form fields with the data the user initially entered.p  pWhat I want to do then is for the user to be able to edit this data and save the item, but instead of it being added to the collection  viewstate it edits whatever item the user had chosen and updates the collection  viewstate to reflect that.p  pFor example, imagine a form with two fieldsp  pName Agep  pI enter Bob and 46 and hit save. p  pRepeater now shows an entry for Bob 46 with an edit button beside it. User clicks on the edit button and the form fields are populated with Bob and 46 again.p  pUser then changes it to Bob Age 47 and hits save. Now instead of there then being two entries Bob 46 and Bob 47  the bob 46 one would be updated to Bob 47.p  pHope this is clear, Its a little obscure but I think Ive explained the gist of it. Important thing to remember is that this is all happening in the update panel so Im using Viewstate to contain the collection that populates the repeater.p
