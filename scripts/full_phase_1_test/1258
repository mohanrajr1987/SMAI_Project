Positive 1258 pI know there are many similar questions answered on stack overflow but I find that none of the solutions presented solves this problem.p  pI have two activities which both utilise the camera preview as soon as they are started, and the first of those activities leads to the other after a successful photo is taken. The problem I experience is crashes at various points due to the camera not being released properly.p  pIts pretty much two things going on in parallel 1. onPauseResume, onStartStop, onCreateDestroy in the main thread 2. SurfaceCreated, SurfaceChanged, SurfaceDestroyed in the surface view threadp  pHow do you properly manage the camera resource so that it is correctly hogged and released considering all the things that happen in regards to the above mentioned state changes I have tried managing the camera resource in the surface view callbacks like many answers suggests, like this one a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions10482057androidcamerasurfaceviewAndroid Camera Surface Viewa  as it says Note Surface will be destroyed when your application will go on pause.. It is true that the surface is destroyed when onPause is called, but since it happens in another thread it doesnt happen straight away. I experience issues when directly switching to another app using the camera if I do it this way. The other app cannot connect to the camera. It also seems like when my second camera previewing activity is called, surfaceDestroyed is not called fast enough since it too fails to use the camera and crashes.p  pWhats the right way to go about managing the camera in regards to both of these threadsp
Positive 1258 pIve used OpenCV to calibrate my camera from different views and I obtained intrinsics, rvec and tvec with a reprojection error of .03 px I thus think the calibration is fine.p  pNow, given one view of my scene, I want to be able to click on a point and find its projection on the other views.

Different queries will have different worker created for it since they need to write separate csv files. To start off, I have decoupled the tasks into two different actors.
