Should be simple but I am lost.p  precode    ltligtTransaction Numberltligt     ltligtltinput typetext nametnumber ltligt  do i need to use value     ltligtEmployee Nameltligt     ltligtltinput typetext nameename ltligt     ltligtltinput typeSUBMIT valueAddgtltligt       ......     ......     sqlite3 db envROOTdatabase.db     db eval INSERT INTO trans VALUES tnumber, ename     db close codepre  pThey are both in a same file and there are only two fields to the database to keep things simple. What I can see here is that tnumber and ename arent declared as variables. So how do I do that so that the text input is assigned to respective variables p
