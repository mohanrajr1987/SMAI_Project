Positive 1796 pI have a program written in python 2.7 which takes photos of a sample from 3 different cameras when the result value is typed into the program. p  pThe USB controller bandwidth cant handle all cameras firing at the same time, so I have to call each one individually. This causes a delay between pressing the value and the preview of the pictures showing up. p  pDuring this delay, the program is still able to accept keyboard commands which are then addressed once the photos have been taken. This is causing issues, as sometimes, values are inputted twice, which means that the value is then applied to the next one after it has taken the photos for the first sample. p  pWhat Im after is a strongway to disregard any queued keyboard commandsstrong whilst the program is working on the current commandp  precodedef selChangeself     Disable the textbox     self.valInput.configurestatedisabled      Gather pictures from cameras and store them in 2D list with sample result This  takes a second or two to complete     self.gatherPictures      if not intself.SampleList.size  0         clear texbox         self.valInput.delete0,END          Create previews from 2D list         self.img1  ImageTk.PhotoImageself.dataList[intself.SampleList.curselection[0]][2].resize250,250,Image.ANTIALIAS         self.pic1.configureimage  self.img1         self.img2  ImageTk.PhotoImageself.dataList[intself.SampleList.curselection[0]][3].resize250,250,Image.ANTIALIAS         self.pic2.configureimage  self.img2         self.img3  ImageTk.PhotoImageself.dataList[intself.SampleList.curselection[0]][4].resize250,250,Image.ANTIALIAS         self.pic3.configureimage  self.img3         self.img4  ImageTk.PhotoImageImage.openData  strself.dataList[intself.SampleList.curselection[0]][1]  .jpg.resize250,250,Image.ANTIALIAS         self.pic4.configureimage  self.img4      Unlock textbox ready for next sample     self.valInput.configurestatenormal codepre  pI was hoping that disabling the textbox and reenabling it afterwards would work, but it doesnt.
