Negative 2990 pHy everyone, I know there are a lot of posts regarding closing sessions but I have kind of a strange situation. So, basically. You come to my page, and You dont have to log in. I immediately start a session and grab Your sessionid. On the page, You can upload an image and enter some data, at which point when you click the save button a php script makes a folder named as Your sessionid and puts the image and data as a generated html page into that folder. Now, I want to be able to delete that folder once when You live my page. Is that possible If not, is it ok to delete the folder after lets say 24 hours I know I can use sessiondestroy to destroy the session, but how can I first delete Your folder and then close the session Any advice Thanks in advancep
