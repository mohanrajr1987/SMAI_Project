Positive 201 pWhat status code is more appropriate for a case when relation is not existingp  pFor instance, codearticles1comments4code, with this call you will get codecommentIDcode 4 from codearticleIDcode 1. But what if codecommentIDcode 4 not exists in this relation, what should API returned, code404code or code200code  p  pstrongEDITstrong Let me clarify what do I meant.p  pThe thing is, you can interpret code404code like resource not exists from another point of view, for instance codearticles1builders3code. You dont have such route at all in your application Your application does have handler for such url completely. But codearticles1comments4code. You have such route in app, you have handler controller. And yeah, I know that this url reflect relationship between comments and articles, and this is why it is tricky. Because comment with codeIDcode 4 might exists in your codeDBcode even if it does not belong to article. Then if you have such route in application you may say that from http protocol point of view you have such resource, but based on your application logic, you may say that such comment not belongs to specified article. p

Negative 201 pstrongSituationstrongp  pI have a multimodule Maven project. In it, I have several JAR artefacts, it then gets assembled as a WAR file. Thus, the WAR artefact depends on all kinds of JAR artefacts it also has a WAR overlay, most of them with scope compile.p  pBuild and deployment to a repository are fine. But when I try to retrieve the WAR artefact, I have issues. previously, I used a simple wget to retrieve it from the Nexus API, but I wanted to try the Jenkins Repository Connector  not the least reason being that it actually shows a list of available versions.p  pI configure a repository in p  precodeManage Jenkins gt Configure System gt Artifact Resolver codepre  pwith the URL for our repop  precodehttpNEXUSnexuscontentrepositoriesreleases codepre  pthen in the job, i add a parameterp  precodeMaven Repository Artifact codepre  pand use the repository configured above, then i add p  precodeArtifact Resolver codepre  pas a build step and set it up. p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pI am not even sure on which side this should be solved When I run the job to try to get the WAR file from the nexus, it also starts trying to retrieve all kinds of transitive dependencies some of which are unaccessible to this user and fails. What I need is just the WAR file. No transitive dependencies since theyre already packaged in the WAR.p  pThe Repository Connector plugin doesnt seem to have a switch for this, and the Maven side its probably perfectly OK to include those dependencies in the output POM.p  pstrongQuestionstrongp  pWhat can I do to either stop the repository connector from retrieving transitive dependencies or retrieve the WAR artefact in a different way Also interesting for me but a bit broad as a question would be general ideas about doing this kind of workflow. E.g., does anyone use other ways of deploying the WAR emintoem their Nexus p

Negative 201 pI have a multidimensional array with locations data e.g. address, phone, name,.. and their relative distance from a certain point as floats e.g. code0.49012608405149code or code0.72952439473047code or code1.4652101344361code or code13.476735354172code.p  pNow I need to sort this array so that it starts with the data set of closest distance code0.49012608405149code and ends with the farthest code13.476735354172code.p  pThe function I use so far does a good job, but messes up some times, which is of course as it uses strcmpp  precodefunction cmpa, b              return strcmpa[distance], b[distance]                  usortresultPartner, cmp codepre  pI googled a lot but couldnt find anything for my case.
