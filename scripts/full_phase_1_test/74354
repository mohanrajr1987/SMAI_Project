Positive 74354 ptldr Many Rails apps or one VertxPlay appp  pIve been having discussions with other members of my team on the pros and cons of using an async app server such as the Play Framework built on Netty versus spinning up multiple instances of a Rails app server.p  pI know that Netty is asynchronousnonblocking, meaning during a database query, network request, or something similar an async call will allow the event loop thread to switch from the blocked request to another request ready to be processedserved. This will keep the CPUs busy instead of blocking and waiting.p  pIm arguing in favor or using something such as the Play Framework or Vertx.io, something that is nonblocking... Scalable. My team members, on the other hand, are saying that you can get the same benefit by using multiple instances of a Rails app, which out of the box only comes with one thread and doesnt have true concurrency as do apps on the JVM. They are saying just use enough app instances to match the performance of one Play application or however many Play apps we use, and when a Rails app blocks the OS will switch processes to a different Rails app. In the end, they are saying that the CPUs will be doing the same amount of work and we will get the same performance.p  pSo here are my questionsp  ul liAre there any logical fallacies in the arguments above Would the OS manage the Rails app instances as well as Netty which also runs on the JVM, which maps threads to cores very well manages requests in its event loopli liWould the OS be as performant in switching on blocking calls as would something like Netty or Vertx, or even something built on Rubys own EventMachineli liWith enough Rails app instances to match the performance Play apps, would there be a cost noticeable cost difference in running the servers If there are no cost difference it wouldnt really matter what method is used, in my opinion. Shoot if it was cheaper financially to run up a million Rails apps than one Play app I would rather do that. li liWhat are some other benefits to using either of these approaches that I may be failing to ask aboutli ul

Negative 74354 pI am trying to set up JBoss 7.2.0 Final on CentOS 6.5 to handle 4 different deployments of our software. Im not sure if I have set things up correctly or not, but everything seems to work except that codeserver.logcode is not ending up where I think I am telling it to be saved in 3 of 4 deployments.p  pThere are 4 HTTP ports being used for the deployments. They are code8080code, code8180code, code9876code, and code9976code. I dont know if that is relevant information or not, but I bring it up because in each codestandalone.xmlcode file I am using the codejboss.socket.binding.portoffsetcode option to assign the ports. The only deployment that seems to work flawlessly is code8080code, which has codejboss.socket.binding.portoffset0code. code8180code has codejboss.socket.binding.portoffset100code, etc.p  pEach deployment lives in its own directory, for examplep  precodeoptjbosseap6.1targetstandalone8080 codepre  pandp  precodeoptjbosseap6.1targetstandalone9876 codepre  pIn the codestandalone.xmlcode file for each deployment codeoptjbosseap6.1targetstandalone9876configurationstandalone.xmlcode, for example, the server log is specified in the same wayp  precodeltfile relativetojboss.server.log.dir pathserver.loggt codepre  pThis should result in the server.log being saved in, for example, codeoptjbosseap6.1targetstandalone9876logcode, and when redeploying the software on each port, I have echoed out the codeJBOSSLOGDIRcode variable and it seems on the surface to be set correctly in each case.p  pstrongHoweverstrong, as mentioned above, emonlyem port code8080code creates the codeserver.logcode file in the expected location codeoptjbosseap6.1targetstandalone8080logcode.p  pstrongThe incorrect locationsstrongp  pPort code8180code puts its codeserver.logcode file in the code8080code location. I.e., code8180code overwrites the codeserver.logcode file at codeoptjbosseap6.1targetstandalone8080logcode.p  pPort code9876code puts its server.log file in codeoptjbosseap6.1targetstandalonelogcode. I.e., it creates a new folder simply called codestandalonecode and puts the file there. I will add that in a former time, the entire port code9876code deployment lived in a folder at that path codeoptjbosseap6.1targetstandalonecode. This apparent clue makes me think there is some other place where there is a setting for the codeserver.logcode file path. I could be quite wrong.p  pFinally, port code9976code is putting its server.log file one level above the desired codelogcode directory, in other words, at codeoptjbosseap6.1targetstandalone9976code.p  pI dont know if the way these 4 deployments are being handled is fundamentally incorrect or if there is a setting hiding somewhere that is overriding my desired paths.p  pI saw a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions19039755jboss711doesnotcreateserverlogone postera with a similar problem say they made a change to codedomain.xmlcode to fix the issue. I dont think I can do that, since I only have one codedomain.xmlcode file located in codeoptjbosseap6.1domainconfigurationcode  that is associated with all 4 deployments.p  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9910571howtoconfigurejboss7towritelogstodifferentfolder99139439913943Another posta recommended removing the relativeto bit in the codeltfilegtcode tag in the codestandalone.xmlcode file. I tried that with port code9876code as follows p  precodeltfile pathoptjbosseap6.1targetstandalone9876logserver.loggt codepre  pThis did not work for me. The server.log file still ended up inp  precodeltfile pathoptjbosseap6.1targetstandalonelogserver.loggt codepre  pAny ideas what I am doing wrong Is there simply another place I need to declare my log path, or is the way these 4 servers are set up just plain incorrectp
