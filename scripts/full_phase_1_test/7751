Positive 7751 pI am building a query to search for records matching any number of fields in a table with 15 columns. All fields for which an input is given must match.p  pHowever, the original table was badly designed, in some cases having upwards of ten fields for the same thing. With names such as Street11. I have separated the data into multiple tables such that codeStreet2code through codeStreet12code are now all labeled under codeStreet2code in a separate table, containing only that column and codefileIDcode, which is taken from the main tables primary key. There is no formal relation between the two, though codefileIDcode in the secondary table serves as a foreign key.p  pPrior to the normalization efforts, the search form was using a hrefhttppastebin.comA4WFUZKX relnofollowthis querya. While not optimal, it was at least functional. I have since removed the segments searching the codeStreetXcode and codeBlockXcode fields, replacing them with subqueriesp  precodeWHERE       [Map index].fileID IN           SELECT fileID FROM [fileIDStreet]      WHERE [fileIDStreet].Street2 LIKE  amp [Forms][DWForm][Street] amp          OR      [Forms][DWForm][Street] Is Null  AND       [Map index].fileID IN           SELECT fileID FROM [fileIDblockLot]      WHERE [fileIDblockLot].Block LIKE  amp [Forms][DWForm][Street] amp        OR      [Forms][DWForm][Block] Is Null  codepre  pThe above queries search the smaller tables. However, when including these in the main query between the codeFROMcode and current codeWHEREcode clauses, with the current codeWHEREcode replaced with codeANDcodeI have encountered a truly staggering loss of performance including just the Street clause with relevant section of the original query removed raises processing time from 5s to 45s. Adding both subqueries slows the search time to well over three minutes.p  pAt this point its clear that Im likely going about this the wrong way what information Ive been able to find such as a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions4900762bigperformancelosswhenusinginsubquerywhyherea seems to indicate that the subqueries might be running on the entire subtable for every record. What emshouldem I be doing in this situationp
Positive 7751 pI am attempting to design a query that will return a set of rows from table codeAcode which have a codefileIDcode value matching at least one row in a subset of table codeBcode, where table codeBcode is filtered such that codeB.row1 CONTAINS varInputcode. codeBcode has only two columns, codefileIDcode and coderow1code.p  pI have made two attempts at this so far First with a subquery of the formp  precodeWHERE       A.fileID IN             SELECT fileID FROM B       WHERE B.row1 LIKE  amp varInput amp            OR varInput Is Null  codepre  pWhile the above method returns the values Im looking for, it is unacceptably slow adding it to my WHERE clause results in the search as a whole taking upwards of 45 seconds. Without the subquery, the search takes less than 3 seconds.p  pIn an effort to improve speeds, I replaced the subquery with a JOIN operation, as recommended a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions31816055access2007subqueriescausingmassiveperformancelossherea. However, the join Im using codeLEFT OUTER JOIN B ON A.fileID  B.fileIDcode does not actually filter out any results, and Im not sure what I can do to change that, if anything. Using an inner join instead makes no difference, as every row in codeBcode contains a codefileIDcode that is also present in codeAcode, as codeBcode is derived from codeAcode.p  pI attempted to improve results by joining on codevarInput  B.fileIDcode instead, but it appears that I cannot use input values varInput is here the content of a textbox control on an unbound form in JOIN statements.p  pFor context, codeBcode is generated as an attempt to normalize codeAcode, which contains twelve fields for the same category of data. In this case, street names. The original query displays most columns of codeAcode, but only one from the group that have been condensed into codeBcode. The above subquery gave the same results as the following excerpt from the original queryp  precodeAND    A.row LIKE  amp varInput amp    OR A.row1 LIKE  amp varInput amp    ...   OR A.row12 LIKE  amp varInput amp   codepre  pI suppose, then, that my question boils down to How can the results of the above subquery be replicated in a faster mannerp  pAlternately, I believe that the slowdown may have been caused by the subquery executing for each record in table A if this is the case, what if anything can be done to ensure that it runs only once, storing the results so that they can be compared to each record in codeAcodep  hr  pI have followed the advice of Gordon Linoff, below, and found that while his method placing a query eminem a join is both functional and fast for a single join when codevarInputcode is given, it does not function as desired when multiple joins are in play, returning rows for which emeitherem join is true, rather than both. I suspect I can fix this by nesting the joins instead of running them in sequence, but am not certain of the specifics.p  pTo clarify the multiple joins aspect, consider a third table codeCcode. In addition to searching for the codefileIDcode of rows containing codevarInputcode in codeBcode, I also need a row in codeCcode matching codeinput2code. codeCcode contains columns called codefileIDcode and coderowCcode. I need to return exactly one record for each codefileIDcode E such that there is some row in codeBcode with codefileIDcodeE AND coderow1codecodevarInputcode and there is some row in codeCcode with codefileIDcodeE AND coderowCcodecodeinput2code.p  pSee a hrefhttppastebin.comBegMeiLU relnofollowthis pastea for an example.

Positive 7751 pI am working on a database with two different tables.br The first contains every change in the database like a transaction table.

The second table contains the total value of every object that should be available in those places.p  pNow here is my questionbr I want to automaticly sum up every entry with the same object and location inside of table one and save this value inside of table two.br BUTbr Sometimes there are special entrys in table one which sould not be summed up with the other values.

Which also means that every object has different amounts depending on the location.p  pThe fourth column contains an information why this transaction happend. It tells me if this transaction happend because i bought something or because i sold something OR because i counted my stock.br This is the special indicator which should tell my database not to sum up this value but instead overwrite the previous one with this.p  pThe fifth and last column contains the date when this transaction happend. This is very important because the whole table is sorted by the date.
