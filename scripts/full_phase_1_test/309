Positive 309 pThis question is mostly game engine independent but I have been unable to find a good answer. p  pIm creating a turnbased tile game in 3D space using Unity. The levels will have slopes, occasional nonplanar geometry, depressions, tunnels, stairs etc. Each level is statichandcrafted so tiles should never move. strongI need a good way to keep track of tilespecific variables for static levels and id like to verify if my approaches make sensestrong.p  pMy ideas arep  ol liCreate 2 Meshes  1 is the complex game world, the second is a reference mesh overlay that will have minimal geometry it will not be rendered and will only be used for the tiles. I would then Overlay the two and use the 2nd mesh as a grid reference.li liHardcode the tiles for each level. While tedious it will work as a brute force approach. I would, however, like to avoid this since its not very easy to deal with visually.li liWorkaround approach  Convert the 3d to 2D textures and only use 1 mesh.li liProject a plane down onto the level and record heightslope to minimize complexity. Also not ideal.li liCreate individual tile objects for each tile manually nonrendered. Easiest solution i could think of.li ol  pNow for the strongUnity3D specific questionstrong Does unity allow selecting and assigning individual VertsTrianglesSquares of a mesh and adding componenets, scripts, or variables to those selections for example, selecting 1 square in the 10x10 unity plane and telling unity the square of that plane now has a new boolean attached to it This question mostly refers to idea 1 above, where i would use a reference mesh for positional and variable information that were directly assigned to the mesh. I have a feeling that if i do choose to have a reference mesh, id need to have the tiles be individual objects, snap them in place using the reference, then attach relevant scripts to those tiles.p  pI have found a ton of excellent resources like a hrefhttpwwwcsstudents.stanford.eduamitpgameprog.html relnofollowhttpwwwcsstudents.stanford.eduamitpgameprog.htmla on tile generation mostly procedural, im a bit stuck on the basics due to being new to unity and im not looking for procedural design.p

Negative 309 pI am trying to run a very simple hadoop job. It is a modification of the classic wordCount which, instead of counting words, it counts lines in a file. I want to use this to clean up a bunch of big log files around 70GB each that I know have duplications. Each line is a record, and hence I am interested in just getting each record once.p  pI know my code works, because it does what it should do when I run it with small normal files. When I run it with big files, Hadoop behaves stringently. First, it starts correctly working on the MAP phase, which normally reaches 100 without problems. When dealing with REDUCE, however, it never reaches more than 50. It reaches maybe 40, and then go back to 0 after showing some No space left on device exceptionsp  precodeFSError java.io.IOException No space left on device codepre  pThen it tries to do REDUCE again and, when it reaches 40, it drops to 0 again and so forth. It does this 2 or 3 times before it decides to end without success, of course.p  pThe problem with this exception, though, is that it cant be related to the actual space on the disks. Disk space never gets full. Not the total global space on the HDFS, neither the individual disks in each node. I check the fs status withp  precode hadoop dfsadmin report gt report codepre  pThis report never shows an actual node reaching 100. In fact, no node come close to that.p  pI have around 60GB of disk available in each node for me, and I run this in a cluster with 60 data nodes, which gives me a total space of more than 3TB. The file I am trying to process is only 70GB.p  pLooking out there on the internet, I found that this can be related to Hadoop creating too many files while processing a lot of data. The original wordCount code reduces the data substantially since words repeat a lot. A file with 70GB can be reduced to an output of just 7MB. However, I am expecting something like 13 reduction only, or an output of around 2030GB.p  pUnixtype systems come with a limit of 1024 open files per processp  precode ulimit n 1024 codepre  pIf hadoop is creating more than that, it could be a problem. I asked the system admin to increment that limit to 65K, which is that the limit is nowp  precode ulimit n 65000 codepre  pProblems continue.
