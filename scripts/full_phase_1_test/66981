Vagrant cannot forward the specified ports on this VM, since they would collide with some other application that is already listening on these ports. The forwarded port to 12001 is already in use on the host machine.  To fix this, modify your current projects Vagrantfile to use another port. Example, where 1234 would be replaced by a unique host port    config.vm.network forwardedport, guest 2001, host 1234  Sometimes, Vagrant will attempt to autocorrect this for you.
