Positive 6941 pIm using Python 3.4.3 and OpenCV 3.0.0 to process applying various filters to a very large image 80,000 x 60,000 in memory and Id like to use multiple CPU cores to improve performance. After some reading, I arrived at two possible method  1 Use pythons codemultiprocessingcode module, let each process deal with a slice of the large image and join the results after processing is done And this probably should be performed on POSIX system 2 Since NumPy supports OpenMP and OpenCV uses NumPy, I can just leave the multiprocessing to NumPy p  pSo my question is p  pWhich one will be a better solution If they dont seem reasonable, what would be a possible approach p  pIf Option 2 is good, should I build both NumPy and OpenCV with OpenMP  How would I actually make multiprocessing happen  I couldnt really find useful instruction.. p

Positive 6941 pI dont understand quite how does imwarp works having the size of the output view The MATLAB help says that if you set the output view by function imref2d then imwarp knows the size and location of the transformed image in the output.
