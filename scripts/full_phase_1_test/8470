It needs to be generic so I can pass in any class and the property will be updated. p
Positive 8470 pI am looking to select one item from a set. It does not matter which item it is, but i want it to be the same item every time the function is called.p  pFor example, if i had the setp  precodemyset  set[ABC,ABC inc, ABC ltd] codepre  pThen I want to return any one of those, but the same one whenever the function is run. [i.e. so I would always get ABC, or always get ABC inc whenever i ran with the above set. ] If I was using lists, I would just take the first item, but sets dont have a first per se.p  pThis is contrast to selecting randomly [e.g. a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions1262955howdoipick2randomitemsfromapythonsetHow do I pick 2 random items from a Python seta ] where it will change every time it is run.p

Positive 8470 pI have database with user subscriptions to topics. There is currently about 20 000 topics, 20 mln users and 200 mln subscriptions stored in SQL database. Because of its size, the database is partitioned by topics, so I cant get the info in one database query. There are couple of topics with 10 mln subscriptions, couple with 100 000 and others have hundreds or less.p  pWhen an event occurs, it usually matches couple of topics, so to inform users, I need to perform query like give me all users subscribed to topics x, y, z and perform union of sets, so that one user gets the news once even if he subscribed both topics x and z.p  pThe constraints arep  ul liThere must be no duplicates in the union set. users cant get the content twiceli liThere can be bounded amount of users missing from the union set. if sometimes user doesnt get the content, it is not that bad, but it cant be always the same user for the same topicli liIt is possible to subscribe to new topic without rebuilding whole thing.li ul  pI thought about using set of bloom filters for every topic, but they constraints are the other way round user either not subscribed for sure or probably subscribed. I need something like user subscribed for sure or probably not.p  pLossy hash tables might be good idea, but I am not sure, if they can be as memory efficient as bloom filters and I am afraid, that it would be always the same user, that is missing the content in his topic.p  pDo you know any other data structures, that mey be good for solving this problemp

Positive 8470 pI have several workers written in python that are parsing pages and harvesting links. Im trying to work out a way they can coordinate so theyre not repeatedly hitting the same locations.p  pIm thinking I can do this with redis. Im trying to build a circular queue of an arbitrary size say 10000 items of a set type so that I can use sismember to verify a link has NOT been visited recently before parsing it and not have to worry about entering the same link twice. Im already doing this in memory with python set but this only works for a specific worker.p  pIs this possible The other possibility I saw was building a set of unspecified size with timeouts attached to the individual members.
