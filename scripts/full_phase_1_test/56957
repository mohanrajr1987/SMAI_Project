Negative 56957 pI have a gobbler that reads the output from a Process.p  pThere is a case where we kill the process programatically using its PID and the external Windows taskkill command.p  pstrongIt is a 16Bit DOS processstrongp  pWe taskkill because it is a DOS 16bit process and Process.destroyForcibly does not work with it because it resides in the ntvdm subsystem and the best way is to get the PID and use taskkill T F which does indeed kill it and any children.p  pNormally, we have no problem with our DOS 16bit or 32 bit processes. This one has some file locks in place. It is especially important that we ensure it is dead to have the OS release the locks.p  pstrongWe close all streams before and after the killstrongp  pPrior to calling taskkill, we attempt to flush and close all streams in an executor in,out,err.

Negative 56957 pI have a question about C2DM. It is not a configuration, IDs, or usage question. I think I have all that squared away. Instead it is about a specific failure scenario.p  pI send a C2DM to a device and it does not wake from sleep. It is using ATampT with WiFi disabled and is not plugged into the charger. I think all of those are important things to mention.p  pWhen I turn on the device I can browse the internet, sync gmail, and sendreceive xmpp packets from within the application I am writing  the same one that embeds the C2DM broadcast receiver.p  pThe device is now in a state where there is an undelivered C2DM messages but otherwise seems to be connected to the Internet and running. At this point if I go into and out of airplane mode I immediately get the missing C2DM message.p  pQuestion Anybody else seeing this and have an explanationp  pIm used to this stuff on WinMo with junky RILs  but dont know what to try on Androidp  pEdit One I understand that C2DM is not guaranteed delivery. But, if it always fails under certain circumstances that is a different thing altogether. I am seeing it fail on sleeping devices and not recovering until I cycle airplane mode. Hopefully this makes my question more unique than one that can be answered with C2DM delivery is not guaranteed.p  pEdit Two I can not reproduce this on a WiFi Xoom against my home router. It is easily reproducible on the Galaxy Tab 8.9 with a stock ROM. Could it be that be ATampT is closing the connection in a way not detected by the C2DM client code and that cycling airplane mode forces a reconnection That sort of limitation should be documented or considered a bug rightp

Negative 56957 pIm writing a ViewModel library which works with my WPF Custom Controls. My problem is that my DomainModel has a large amount of Data Types Cd,Pens,Gadgets,Books,ecc. All these Data Types are enumerated with an enum I have more or less 1 hundred DataTypes, and each data Type corresponds to a DB table.p  pSo the idea is to have a ViewModel library which exposes one property for each data type, thus my UI controls can directly bind the properties of my viewModel. The viewModel for each property return an ObservableCollection. For instance, if Id like to have my combo box populated with the Gadgets data, in my XAML I ll have something like  p  precodeltmyXCombo ItemsSourceBinding Gadgets .... gt codepre  pand in my ViewModel Ill have p  precodepublic ObservableCollectionltGadgetsgt Gadgets      get               get gadgets data from my domain model         return model.GetDataDataEnum.Gadgets       codepre  pNow, in order to do that, I need in my ViewModel one property for each enumeration value, but Id like to avoid to put 1 hundred property accessors. Im lazy and this can be very error prone. I know, in c4 we have dynamic properties, so in this way I can avoid to write 100 property accessors, but I MUST use .net 3.5 which has no dynamic properties, i cannot use .net 4 p  pIs there anyone who has already had this problem or any suggestionp  pThanks a lot in advance.p
