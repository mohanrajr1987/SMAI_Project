Positive 6439 pI want to change the default colors in the powerlineevilcentercolortheme. I am specifically looking to change the the face colors of the evilstate face such that the background and foreground colors matches my Emacs color theme.p  pI have tried to look at the readme on powerlineevil, but it doesnt tell me how to configure the colors via my init.el, and Ive tried modifying the code in powerlineevil.el to change the colors manually, but it still didnt work. p  pThe following code is taken from my powerlineevil.elp  precodedefface powerlineevilbaseface   t foreground green inherit modeline   Base face for powerline evil faces.   group powerline  defface powerlineevilnormalface   t background 909737 inherit powerlineevilbaseface   Powerline face for evil NORMAL state.   group powerline  defface powerlineevilinsertface   t background blue inherit powerlineevilbaseface   Powerline face for evil INSERT state.   group powerline  defface powerlineevilvisualface   t background orange inherit powerlineevilbaseface   Powerline face for evil VISUAL state.   group powerline  defface powerlineeviloperatorface   t background cyan inherit powerlineeviloperatorface   Powerline face for evil OPERATOR state.   group powerline  defface powerlineevilreplaceface   t background red inherit powerlineevilbaseface   Powerline face for evil REPLACE state.   group powerline  defface powerlineevilmotionface   t background magenta inherit powerlineevilbaseface   Powerline face for evil MOTION state.   group powerline codepre  pEven if I set the foreground to be green, as you can see in the code above, it still displays as white.

Negative 6439 pIm a product manager and not a developer so please be gentle if my question stupid.p  pI am currently trying to integrate our software with RSA SecurID, per a customer requirement actually, like 20. For the record, I dont want to and I based on my research there are better and cheaper solutions out there, but I digress.p  pOne of the issues we can into is that you cannot communicate directly with their Authentication Manager AM. Instead, you have to use this RSA agent and send calls to the agent, which communicates with the AM. When you make calls to the agent, you also feed it file paths for specific files it needs that contain things it will need to communicate with the AM cert, addresses, last state of AMs, etc.. Our software is shared SaaS and we cant just dump all of these customers files on the servers hard drive. Ideally, They need to be in the database, but the agent wont accept the files to be sent to it, like in an object, it expects them to be at a physical file path.p  pSo my questions arep  ul liHas anyone else developed against RSAs SecurID solutionli liHow did you handle storing the sdreq, nodesecret, etc.li liIn general, how would you handle the situation where you need to feed a program file paths while the file resides in a database .NETli ul

Negative 6439 pIve wrote a code which detects squares white in realtime and draws a frame around it. Each side of length l of the squares is divided in 7 parts. Then I draw a line of length hl7 at each of the six points evolving from the deviation perpendicular to the side of the triangle blue. The corners are marked in red. It then looks something like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comelJzX.png altenter image description herep  pFor the drawing of the blue lines and circles I have a 3 Channel codeCV8UC3code matrix codedrawingcode, which is zero everywhere except at the positions of the red, blue and white lines.

It makes totally sense why it happens, as it just adds the matrices with a weight.p  pId like to have the matrix codedrawingcode with the correct colors over my image.

Negative 6439 pI have java class which has a main method and calls a bash script. What it does in se is generate a value.

However, as you might already know, my changes do not stick.
