Negative 70885 pI am having a major issue, Geolocation is very inconsistant between Android devices. p  pThe Geolocation on my Android Tablet is working Samsung Galaxy, where as on my newest device Samsung Galaxy S3  it doesnt even return a response unless I enable enableHighAccuracy, but then it stops the other devices from working. Ive tested the Geolocation in the browser and on the Google Maps app which return correct responses and immediate responses. On the HTC it also works finep  pMy manifest settings are as followsp  precodeltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.CAMERA gt ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.INTERNET gt ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.WRITEEXTERNALSTORAGE gt ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.ACCESSNETWORKSTATE gt ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.ACCESSWIFISTATE gt ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.ACCESSFINELOCATION gt ltusespermission androidnameandroid.permission.ACCESSCOARSELOCATION gt  ltusesfeature androidnameandroid.hardware.camera gt ltusesfeature androidnameandroid.hardware.wifi gt ltusesfeature androidnameandroid.hardware.location gt ltusesfeature androidnameandroid.hardware.location.gps gt ltusesfeature androidnameandroid.hardware.location.network gt codepre  pAre there any codechanges that I am supposed to do to PhoneGap to better support GeoLocation Even testing it out on the DEFAULT example yields the exact same results.p  pTesting devicesp  ul lipSamsung Galaxy Tablet Android 4.0.3 .

Negative 70885 pI made an application that should run constant until I stop it.  What it basically does is getting some data from connected another device and send that data to the server periodically using NSURLConnection, and read data from the server periodically and visualize that data as a graph using NSXMLParser.p  pI ran the instrument to check allocs and leaks.  No leak at all. memory monitor shows consistent 5.2MB. Objectalloc graph is stable, Net bytes of objectallo is arouend 480000 and net is around 6400.p  pThe problem is the application is stopped or crashes about 12 hours later.  What are possible problems I have absolutely no idea where to start finding the problem because neither a debugger nor the instrument dont show any error or problem.p  p[added]p  p1 . as Pauls suggestion, I ran my app on the simulator and got some error messages after 5 hours of running.p  precodeInAir64628,0xa050c720 malloc  error for object 0xc015bc87 Nonaligned pointer being freed  set a breakpoint in mallocerrorbreak to debug InAir64628,0xa050c720 malloc  error for object 0xa0200100 pointer being freed was not allocated InAir64628,0xa050c720 malloc  error for object 0x2080a043 pointer being freed was not allocated InAir64628,0xa050c720 malloc  error for object 0x120100 pointer being freed was not allocated InAir64628,0xa050c720 malloc  error for object 0x34a00000 pointer being freed was not allocated InAir64628,0xa050c720 malloc  error for object 0xc1d3a1b1 pointer being freed was not allocated InAir64628,0xa050c720 malloc  error for object 0x46b0a1b1 pointer being freed was not allocated InAir64628,0xa050c720 malloc  error for object 0xc1d3a1b1 pointer being freed was not allocated Program received signal  EXCBADACCESS. codepre  p2 .
