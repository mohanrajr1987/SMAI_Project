Positive 552 pWeve been struggling to debug something quite strange, and Id like some insight on whywhat happened. Let me give you some context of course.p  pA simple method makes an async call with its codeViewModelcode, using one of the codeViewModelscode properties inside it.p  pOn one side of the call, our property called Itinerary, for the sake of the example is there, in perfect condition. On the other side of the method, inside the async call, for some reason, its codenullcode.p  pThe stack trace shows Itinerary going null in between, where only System.Runtime methods are called and could not possibly influence the itinerary itself.p  pWe spent about 3 hours going around this stack trace and the code variables, going from non null to null.p  pThe Itinerary property was not null even though its getter is codereturn itinerarycode which was null at all times in the stacktrace  It literally makes no sense.p  pEverywhere in the code Itinerary shows null, except when you hover the property declaration itself. Which also makes no sense, rightp  pAt some point we just typed codethis.Itinerarycode because, well, we didnt know what to do and it was desperate.p  pAnd it worked.p  pThe property is now kept sane during the whole async process and everything runs smoothly just like it used it.p  pNotes  p  pWere working with the Mono framework, in Xamarin, using Xamarin Studio and this happened in the android runs only. iOS has a clean Itinerary.p  pHere is some pseudo code p  precodeIn a previous method viewModel.DoSomethingAsync   Here the itinerary is valid codepre  pJust 3 lines underp  precode async void DoSomethingAsync        DoSomethingElseWithItinerary  Here Itinerary is null, adding this.  fixes the issue.     codepre  pI only have one Itinerary property, there are no name conflict.p  pstrongNow my question is strongp  pCan anyone, anywhere, think of some kind of explanation that could happen, ever, where codethis.Propertycode is different than codePropertycode, while working in the same class.p

Negative 552 pI have an app where Im having a usercontrol consisting of an ItemsControl with squares represented by a border and underlying controls. Think of it like a chessboard.p  pSince my ItemTemplate consists of a border it doesnt have native support for drag amp drop like the GridView or the ListView. I tried using both GridView and ListView for my squares Before but the GUI became too sluggish so I switched to a simple border which made it alot faster.p  pBy hooking up Manipulation events Ive still managed to get a drag behavior for my border and its content at least when it comes to the GUI. However when I try to drag a square border to another square I cant seem to get the drop event to fire. I need to know which the target square is.p  pI understand that since Im doing my dragampdrop functionality myself I need to do something to hook into the borders drop event, but whatp  pIve also tried to subscribe to the border events PointerEntered, PointerMoved etc. to find out which square the pointer is over and when the button is released i would know which the target square is. This only seem to work in two directions though right and down, the Pointer events doesnt seem to fire when moved left or up, strange. Ive read somwhere that the items squares have different ZIndex and this could affect the firing of events.p  pIve struggled with this for hours now and would really appreciate some help.p

Negative 552 pWhen starting the application, the application consumes slowly more and more memory. I am trying to figure out why this is happening and havent been very successful yet.p  pOur WPF client gets the data pushed in from the server. The backend is in C and the data gets pushed into our C model and wired down through the ViewModels up to the DataGrid.  p  pAfter a while of inactivity though, I can see that the heap memory and the Large Heap Size keep increasing for no reason. Well the data is pushed in, so maybe this is the reason but after 2 hours and 15 min the unnecessarily increased memory is freed up again, just to go slowly up again.p  pOn the right side of the graph after over 24 hours, I have loaded even more tabs and more data, hence the massive increase but from then on there is no freeing up of memory anymore. p  pThe Graph is showing that codeSystem.Windows.EffectiveValueEntry[]code is taking the most memory.  From my understanding this class is related to the WPF dependency objects. But I have no idea what could be causing this.  I am not expecting the memory to go down, as I am not closing anything. But why is it going up like this p  pWhat could be the causep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhSeur.png altenter image description herep  pMany Thanks,p
