Positive 98880 pI am trying to multiply two large matrices and find indexes of biggest 20 or so elements for each row of resulting fairly large 50000x50000 matrix. I hope to use Spark with java for this. I found I can multiply distributed matrices if I store them as BlockMatrices. But otherwise there do not seem to be any more complex operations available for distributed matrices and I am stuck. What would be the best way to do such operation Simple code I have so far looks something like thisp  precodeJavaSparkContext sc  new JavaSparkContextconf BlockMatrix A  getBlockMatrixAsc BlockMatrix B  getBlockMatrixBsc BlockMatrix AB  A.multiplyB codepre
