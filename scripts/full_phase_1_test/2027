Negative 2027 pI have come across an interesting problem when trying to clone a template panel in my ajax tabcontainer control.p  pThe idea is that i have a custom control on the first tab that lists some things, and to add a new thing you click the new button on the custom control, which raises an event in the control  page that contains the tabcontainer. That control  page then goes about cloning the hidden tabpanel and adding the clone to the tabcontainer. p  pwith this markup I get what I need from both the first tab containing the list and any subsequent tabs templated by the hidden tabpanel ready for cloning ...p  precodeltaspTabContainer IDTabContainer1 runatservergt     ltaspTabPanel IDuipnl1 HeaderTextMy Panel runatservergt         ltContentTemplategt             ltcc1myListOfThings IDlist runatserver OnMyEventCreateTabFromTemplate gt         ltContentTemplategt     ltaspTabPanelgt     ltaspTabPanel IDTemplatePanel runatserver Visiblefalsegt         ltHeaderTemplategt             ltspangtHello WorldltspangtltaspLinkButton IDuibtnRemove runatserver Textx gt         ltHeaderTemplategt         ltContentTemplategt             Some content for my panel         ltContentTemplategt     ltaspTabPanelgt ltaspTabContainergt codepre  pOk now lets assume that on the first panel in my custom control i have a button that raises the MyEvent event which in turn calls the method CreateTabFromTemplate.p  pNow what I want to do is copy the hidden panel TemplatePanel and add it to the tab container.p  pIn my code behind, the method code for adding the new tab panel to my tab container works something like this ...p  precodeprotected void CreateTabFromTemplateobject sender, EventArgs e       create a new tab panel     TabPanel newPanel  new TabPanel      instantiate the hidden content template from the hidden note panel in the new panel     uitpNoteCreator.ContentTemplate.InstantiateInnewPanel      add the panel to the available tabs and select it     TabContainer1.Tabs.AddnewPanel     TabContainer1.ActiveTab  newPanel  codepre  pAll looking good so far ... but i missed something ...

Depending on the scenario, DesiredSize might be fully respected by your implementation logic, constraints on DesiredSize might be applied, and such constraints might also change other characteristics of either the parent element or child element. For example, a control that supports scrollable regions but chooses not to derive from the WPF frameworklevel controls that already enable scrollable regions could compare available size to DesiredSize. The control could then set an internal state that enabled scrollbars in the UI for that control.
