Positive 523 pSuppose I have a large square grid represented by a twodimensional array A of size NxN, and a point is assigned to one of the grid by on its coordinates. Each grid is surrounded by eight neighbouring grids think of the number pad in the keyboard, no.5 is surrounded by 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9. p  pNow for each of the neighbouring grids I will do something for it, but some of the elements in the array may not have eight neighbouring grids. If it is on one of the for boarders then it only has five neighbours like no.2 is surrounded by only 1,3,4,5,6, and if it on one of the four corners then it is surrounded by only three neighbours. Given an element of the array A, how to check its neighbours in the most efficient way I can just set up many if statements to see if its array index is larger than 0 or smaller than N1, but how to group nest those if statements so that the least number of steps is requiredp  pthanksp

Positive 523 pGiven a grid, I need to cover the strongtruestrong values with rectangles. The rectangles can only be horizontal or vertical and they can cover two cells at max.  p  pFor example, in this casep  pre 1 1 1 0 0   1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 pre  pthe minimum number of ractangles is 4 1 from strong[0][0]strong to strong[1][0]strong, 2 from strong[0][1]strong to strong[0][2]strong, 3 with only strong[1][4]strong since there arent any adjacent 1s in the up, down, left and right directions and the last one with only strong[2][3]strong in it.p  pI suppose, the problem comes when the grid has many consecutive 1s that split in many directions. For examplep  pre 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 pre  porp  pre 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 pre  pI cannot think of a pretty efficient algorithm to solve this problem, a greedy approach seems to be ineffective. p  pAny help would be really much appreciated, thanks.p  pEDITp  pThe greedy algorithm Ive tried scan the matrix 1 row at a time, if theres a 1 in the current position, then check if theres another 1 in the next row position strong[rowIndex][columnIndex  1]strong and cover both with one rectangle. If not, check the cell below the current position strong[rowIndex  1][columnIndex]strong and  do as before. If there arent any 1s in these positions, cover only the current cell. As you can see, this algorithm doesnt work in the first case. emPerhaps the algorithm must know all the consecutive 1s to compute the minimum number of rectangles. Because of this, Im wondering if some graph stuff comes in, but I cant still think of an optimal solution.em     p
