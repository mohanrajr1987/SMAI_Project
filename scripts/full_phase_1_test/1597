Positive 1597 pDoes the Google Play services fused location provider receive location updates while the device is asleep I would like to be able to periodically wake the device, query the codegetLastLocationcode function for the current location, log the result, and put the device back to sleep  but this would require that the fused location provider receives location updates when the device is asleep so that it has the uptodate data immediately after wake. p  pIf this function doesnt work immediately after waking the device up, what would be a better method for periodic location logging while in a sleep state An answer for either or both coarse or fine location would be useful.p

Negative 1597 pIm currently writing a simple web server and some clients to use it. My customer wants to be able to extend the functionality of the upcoming solution to include web clients but we need to have minute control of the communication so a simple web server is the solution.p  pAnyway, there are two symptoms and I can reproduce them both to 100 by running a bunch of unit tests. The problem comes when I upload a simple string to the server, using a POST command. Its not really something I will do in reality but I cant move ahead not understanding whats going on. I have a unit test that simply serializes the string Hello World, using a BinaryFomatter. I prefix the resulting byte array data with an integer indicating the length of the streamed data. A very simple protocol for sure but it works just fine in all other situations larg object graphs mainly. I have two scenariosp  ol liUpload a very short string Hello Worldli liUpload a large string a few thousand characters.li ol  pWhen I run that unit test without first running any other unit tests this works as expected but whenever I run all my unit tests this one always fails in two different waysp  ol liThe short string doesnt seem to trigger the receiving socket to receiver it. More specifically, when I call Socket.BeginReceive my callback is never called.li liThe long string does trigger reception as expected but the stream gets corrupted. The length prefix 4 byte, serialized Int32 contains a very large value. Certainly not the correct one.li ol  pThis is the interesting part of the server codep  precode    public void Receivebool async  false, TimeSpan timeout  defaultTimeSpan              var asyncResult  socket.BeginReceivelengthBuffer, 0, lengthBuffer.Length, SocketFlags.None, receiveLengthCallback, this         if async             Waittimeout  defaultTimeSpan  Timeout  timeout         if IsComplete             return          SocketError socketError         socket.EndReceiveasyncResult, out socketError         SocketError  socketError           private static void receiveLengthCallbackIAsyncResult asyncResult              try                      var data  SocketDataReceiverasyncResult.AsyncState             var count  data.socket.EndReceiveasyncResult             if count  0                               connection was closed, abort ...                 data.onReceiveAborted                 return                          data.index  count             if data.index lt data.lengthBuffer.Length                               length only partially received, get rest ...                 data.socket.BeginReceivedata.buffer, data.index, data.lengthBuffer.Length  data.index, SocketFlags.None, receiveLengthCallback, data                 return                            done receiving the length prefix ...             data.length  BitConverter.ToInt32data.lengthBuffer, 0             data.Data  new byte[data.length]   ERROR this will cause an OutOfMemoryException when data.length has become corrupted             if data.length  0                               not much to do here, cancel ...                 data.onReceiveAborted                 return                           data.index  0             if data.buffer.Length gt data.length                 data.buffer  new byte[data.length]               start reading content ...             data.socket.BeginReceivedata.buffer, data.index, data.buffer.Length  data.index, SocketFlags.None, receiveCallback, data                  catch Exception ex                       todo handle exception in Socket reception code             throw                    private static void receiveCallbackIAsyncResult asyncResult              try                      var data  SocketDataReceiverasyncResult.AsyncState             var count  data.socket.EndReceiveasyncResult             if count  0                               connection was closed, abort ...                 data.onReceiveAborted                 return                          foreach var b in data.buffer                              data.Data[data.index]  b                 if count  0                     break                          if data.index  data.length                               all data has been received ...                 data.onReceiveComplete                 return                            more data is on the way ...             data.socket.BeginReceivedata.buffer, 0, data.buffer.Length, SocketFlags.None, receiveCallback, data                  catch Exception ex                       todo handle exception in Socket reception code             throw               codepre  pI might be drawinf the wrong conclusions here but I havent seen any problems with streaming object graphs whereas doing the same with serialized strings is problematic. I cant understand why. I would appreciate any hints that could point me in the right direction.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIt appears that the problem is caused by a previous test case and it has nothing to do with sending a string, which was my first suspicion. Is there a way data can linger between two successive uploads The client socket is recreated for every upload though.p  pThis is the client side of the uploadp  precode    private void uploadstring documentName, object data, int timeout  1               todo Handle errors         WebClientEx client         using client  new WebClientEx                      client.Timeout  timeout lt 0  UploadTimeout  timeout             try                              var response  client.UploadData                     new UriServerUri    documentName,                     StreamedData.Wrapdata                  todo Handle response                          catch Exception ex                              throw new ExceptionFailed while uploading   data  ., ex                               GC.Collect  lt this was just experimenting with getting rid of the client socket, for good measure.
