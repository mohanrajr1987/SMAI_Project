Positive 69721 pI am new to Obj C rubyist here so Im not sure how to go about this. So we use AFNetworking in our app which communicates to our server via a JSON API. Looking at the code right now, there is much repetition, and based on my background, I have a penchant for not being repetitive so were aiming to refactor this into just one class. The best would be to include it appwide so we can just access a variable or a method whenever we want to pull something from the server.p  pAnyway, what we have now is something to this effectp  precodeAFHTTPRequestManager manager  [AFHTTPRequestOperationManager manager] manager.responseSerializer  [AFJSONResponseSerializer serializer] manager.requestSerializer  [AFJSONRequestSerializer serializer] [manager.requestSerializer setValuesomeemail.com forHTTPHeaderFieldEMAIL ...  [manager GETurl parametersparameters success AFHTTPRequestOperation operation, id responseObject      do most of the stuff here  failure AFHTTPRequestOperation operation, NSError error     NSLogError , error  codepre  pthats the basic functionality of the method we want to try to make. Most of our API calls in different custom controllers are using this pattern. I was thinking, maybe we can pull it out of all the controllers and make it into a class with a method like codegetResponseObjectcode or something because basically thats the only thing we need  a responseObject of the JSON returned by the server.p  pAlso, we are planning to make it available to the whole app, since most of the app are just API calls to the server. Right now we have sortof encapsulated it into a custom class  but I think if I understand it, every time we do an API call, that class will be createdallocated Is it advisable to just create that single instance of a class in AppDelegate so it can be available at any timep  pemEDITemp  pwe are trying to encapsulate these methods a hrefhttpsgithub.comAFNetworkingAFNetworkingblobmasterAFNetworkingAFHTTPRequestOperationManager.mL114L182 relnofollowhttpsgithub.comAFNetworkingAFNetworkingblobmasterAFNetworkingAFHTTPRequestOperationManager.mL114L182a into just one method that takes in the request type as a string GET, PUT, POST etc. p

Negative 69721 pI have the following scenariop  ul lipAround 70 million of equipments send a signal every 35 minutes to the server sending its id, status online or offiline, IP, location latitude and longitude, parent node and some other information.pli lipThe other information might not be in an standard format so no schema for me but I still need to query it.pli lipThe equipments might disappear for some time or forever not sending signals in the process. So I need a way to forget the equipments if they have not sent a signal in the last X days. Also new equipments might come online at any time. pli lipI need to query all this data. Like knowing how many equipments are offline on a specific region or over an IP range. There wont be many queries running at the same time.pli lipSome of the queries need to run fast less than 3 min per query and at the same time as the database is updating. So I need indexes on the main attributes id, status, IP, location and parent node. The query results do not need to be 100 accurate, eventual consistency is fine as long as it doesnt take too long more than 20 min on avarage for them to appear in the queries results.pli lipI dont need persistence at all, if the power goes out its okay to lose everything.pli ul  pGiven all this I thought of using a noSQL approach maybe MongoDB or CouchDB since I have experience with MapReduce and Javascript but I dont know which one is better for my problem Im gravitating towards CouchDB or if they are fit at all to handle this massive workload. I dont even know if I actually need a traditional database since I dont need persistence to disk maybe a mainmemory approach would be better, but I do need a way to build custom queries easily.p  pThe main problem I detect are the followingp  ul lipNeed to insertupdate lots of tuples really fast and I dont know beforehand if the signal I receive is already in the database or not. Almost all of the signals will be in the same state as they were the last time, so maybe query by id and check to see if the tuple changed if not do nothing, if it did updatepli lipForgeting offline equipments. A batch job that runs during the night removing expired tuples would solve this problem.pli lipThere wont be many queries running at the same time, but they need to run fast. So I guess I need to have a cluster that perform a single query on multiple nodes of the cluster does CouchDB MapReduce splits the workload to multiple nodes of the cluster. Im not enterily sure I need a cluster though, could a single more expensive machine handle all the loadpli lipI have never used a noSQL system before, but I have theoretical knowledge of the subject.pli ul
