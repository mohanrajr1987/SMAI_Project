Positive 314 pSummary Ive tried things like bubble points and messing around with marker size but neither can be set a radius in actual grid units. Bubble chart and markerpointsignores gridp  pHow can I add a circle to my chart with a radius in grid unitsp  p Old  Ive looked up how to change the size of a bubble in the bubble chart and apparently the second Y value should control the size... except it does absolutely nothing.p  pI can not use marker size as a work around because the size needs to be in correct units and not pixels. p  pThe only thing that managed to change the size was the Min and Max size values... but I cant accurately control the size with that not to mention that would be quite silly. p  pNo code as this Has no special codes or settings and should be easy to replicate. p  pEDIT Just realized that bubble sizes are based on other bubble sizes and not the grid. This is a big problem because I need a circle that has a radius in grid units. Also it needs to be alone. p

A user could use only one color or they could make a custom color table with hundreds of keyvalue pairs. Many of these circles will be to the same location on the map. Were talking anywhere from 2 in a stack to 100 on a stack. Thats where marker clusterer comes in.p  pWe cluster the icons to get a sense of how dense the circles are at any given concentration. However, whats more important is the composition of the clusters. 25 grey circles means nothing, but 24 grey circles and 1 red circle is a big deal.p  pI want the clusters to have a label above them that shows each clusters compositionp  pcode2 red     Just a red dot.  3 grey    Grey dot. 17 purple  Purple dot.
