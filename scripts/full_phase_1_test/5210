Ive tried looping until the data contains a null terminator code0code, which doesnt seem to work. Ive also tried checking for empty lines coderncode, which doesnt work as well since there is an empty line between the headers and the HTML content of a page.p  pWhat I have noticed is that I could possibly use the ContentLength header to solve this issue. However, I would be unsure how to get that header, since it requires at least one recv call, and if there is a good, safe and efficient way to do it. Im also not sure what to do when the response doesnt include the ContentLength header, since the program will then get stuck in an infinite loop.p  pSo if there is a method that allows me to repeat recv until the end of a HTTP stream has been reached, Id like to know about it.p  pIf anyone could help me with this Id appreciate itp

Negative 5210 pLets say I have a table with four columns and an ever increasing amount of rows lets say a couple million. Its the biggest table I have to deal with. I do batch insert, update, and deletes on it often. The rows included in these will have no rhyme or reason. I also select on it often but every time I select I select rows in small groups based on a certain column. So for instance I select all rows where ColumnA  x and that might average out to 10 or so rows per select. p  pI figure horizontal partitioning could speed up selects so I dont have to search the whole table every time but Im wondering if there will be a potentially big performance penalty on my batch inserts, updates, and deletes There will be no simple way to prevent them from spanning multiple, if not all, partitions.p

It could be an API, but in fact its calls to strongffmpeg clistrong, which in effect is an API to the conversion tools themselves.p blockquote  pWhen talking to an external service, where the data retrieved may not always be the same, how is it best to go about maintaining at least a consistent application state on your end so your application doesnt depend on the external service to workp  pI have already separated out the classes thus far, trying to maintain a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiSingleresponsibilityprinciple relnofollowSRPa within themp  precodeclass CommandDispatcher   codepre  pemThe Command Dispatchers sole job is to make a request for data to ffmpeg and retrieve the response for that data backem.p  precodeclass Converter   codepre  pemThe converters sole responsibility is to take user requests like convert 1 to 2, and send the basics to the command dispatcher which handles the codeexeccode calls.emp  pHere are my questionsp  ul liWhen talking to an external API  service, should I be creating an codeAPIRequestcode and an codeAPIResponsecode object in this case an codeFFmpegResponsecode objectli ul  pI have seen examples of this for OAuth, where there is an OAuth response object. However, thats simple enough because calls to this are done over the HTTP protocol which tends to give back at minimum an error code and a message. Calls to something like ffmpeg dont guarantee a similar response emffmpeg may not be installed, for exampleem. Is this object merely a domain object i.e. an entity some class members and setters and gettersp  ul liValidation. If I am creating an codeFFmpegResponsecode object, whose job is it to put the data into the right members of the Response object li ul  pImagine ffmpeg isnt installed and the codeCommandDispatchercode gets the response back empty. Is it up to the codeCommandDispatchercode to then populate the codeFFmpegResponsecode object with an ffmpeg not installed error Should I have a validation object do thisp  pRemember, Im trying to stick to the Single Responsibility Principle here, so Im thinking that the codeCommandDispatchercode shouldnt care about whether the data is valid or not  it should merely ask for data and retrieve it. Where does my validation fit within the model layer for this servicep  pThis isnt only for FFmpeg but will help for future external service calls. What is the best [practice] way to structure your code and classes to maintain SRP yet also a consistent application state regardless of whether or not the external service responds in an expected wayp
