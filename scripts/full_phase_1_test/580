Positive 580 pI am looking for a perl script able to decode multiple lines of Base64 encoded strings. I found a few tools to do the job line by line. Which is really time consuming considering the amount of lines that I have. I can have all the strings in one base file called infile.txt, would that be possible to run a perl script to convert all the lines in infile.txt to outfile.txt and keeping one line per string p  pThanks for guiding me.p
Positive 580 pI am currently working on project that needs to be able to connect to a external MySQL Database.

And, at the same time have Swift catch it. If this still does not make sense, please tell me.p
