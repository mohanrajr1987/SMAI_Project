Positive 572 pThe question is based on the premise that the dimension of a list can be determinedi.e. we accepted that a list of list is 2D and a list of list of list is 3D etc.p  pAccording to the a hrefhttpsen.wikipedia.orgwikiDimension relnofollowinformal definition on the wiki pagea, the dimension of a mathematical space or object[Here is data structure] is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it.p  pSo the dimension of a list depends on how many layers of sublist it contains. What about an abstract tree I believe the term codedepthcode is used for an abstract tree, which is similar to the idea of dimension of list.p  pSo is dimension of an abstract tree equal to the depth of an abstract tree. Or I am just asking a wrong question like how fast can a fish climb a treep  p[Edit By tree above, I mean a rooted tree.p
Positive 572 pI read a term abstract type which mean you can use the structure or the skeleton. I am talking about binary heap tree . I read its a abstract type but when question arises what will be the time complexity to merge two min heap to create a max heap  I got some answers saying copy elements of trees into array and the use build heap method n create max heap in On time  But how will you copy elements of min heap in const timeor in On time when you cant traverse the tree as its a abstract type. The only thing left with you is delete all element one by one n keep it in array Which will take Onlogn time. Could anyone put some time to make me understand this doubt p  pThanksp

Negative 572 pWhen building Bitmaps and collectively building a few Bitmaps and combining them into one Bitmap does it help to .MakeTransparent.p  pAnd or, before I send the Bitmap to the requesting client if I .MakeTransparent will it become smaller in size not width or height, buy in bytesp  pIn other words will .MakeTransparent optimize the Bitmap, and if not does anyone get any suggestions on how to optmize a Bitmap before sending to the requesting client over the wire via internetp  pThe code in question is codesheet.MakeTransparentcodep  precode internal static TaskltBitmapgt GetDoorSecheduleSheetAsyncShopDrawing.DoorSchedules schedules, RotateFlipType rotate, byte schedulesPerSheet, byte currentI      return Task.Run gt                      var sheet  new BitmapDrawingOptions.PAGEHEIGHTSIZE, DrawingOptions.PAGEWIDTHSIZE             sheet.SetResolution150, 150             byte scheduleCnt  0             float prevWidth  0              using Graphics dc  Graphics.FromImagesheet                             dc.ClearColor.White                  using Pen pen  new PenColor.FromArgb80, Color.Black, 4                                      for  currentI lt schedules.Count currentI                                              if scheduleCnt gt 0                                                      dc.DrawLinepen, prevWidth, 380need constant for start height, prevWidth, sheet.Height                                                   using var doorSchedule  schedules[currentI].Door                                                      dc.DrawImagedoorSchedule, prevWidth  50, 380need constant for start height                             prevWidth  doorSchedule.Width  50                             scheduleCnt                                                   if scheduleCnt  schedulesPerSheet                                                      sheet.RotateFliprotate                             sheet.MakeTransparent                             return sheet                                                                                         sheet.MakeTransparent             sheet.RotateFliprotate             return sheet           codepre  pThank youp

The problem is that when it comes time for the next generation Ewa married to Feivel, child is Gershom we have to figure out how to replicate a structure with a straightline between partners and line to the child coming down from the midpoint of the parents couple line.  A related problem is that right now, the first couple is recognized as a couple different line type only by virtue of them being the first two pieces of data in my nodes list, as opposed to truly being recognized as such by reading the data i.e. hasSpouse, spouse1id, etc..p  pThoughts and ideas to make this work better are much appreciatedp
Negative 572 pI started to work with a group of five new programmers on a large project. Im looking for the best way to share the source code between all the members. Each person is modifying different parts but all parts are related. Im looking for a platform or way that when I change any parts of code they can see it online or as soon as possible.p  pCurrently we conflicted with each other. For instance I worked on the parts of the source code and when I finish my job and I went back to our subversion repository which is google code to upload the new version. Then I realize someone else has been edited the code What can I do in this situationp  pWe are using netbeans and everyone is working far away from each other so we can not have a face to face meeting.p
