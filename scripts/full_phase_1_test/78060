Positive 78060 pI have a problem with my Android Device. A Samsung Galaxy S3 with Cyanogen Mod installed and rooted.p  pOkay some time ago my USB port got broken. I ignored the problem and charged the batteries external. Well yesterday I broke my screen P so I can neither use the touch screen nor the usb connection.p  pHowever, I still can start the phone and it gets online fully functional exempt the screen and the usb port.p  pI also can install new apps over Google Play store on my desktop computer. Airdroid is installed on my mobile phone.p  pSo I did the mistake and never created a backup of contacts, messages and photos  stupid I know.p  pSo is there any possibility to either launch a app like Airdroid remotely or by installing a new app the makes it possible to launch a app remotely as I wrote, I can install everything or is there any other way over the network to get my data without the need of using the phones screenp  pThank you very muchp
Positive 78060 pAccording to the official documentation a hrefhttpsdeveloper.android.comtoolspublishingversioning.html relnofollowVersioning your applicationsa, the androidversionCode must be increased with every release of an Android application.p  pFor release versions supposed to be uploaded to Google Play, I understand why this is necessary. However, what about nightly builds, mainly aimed at developers For these, the versionCode would need to be generated, which is not straightforward SCM like Git without numeric commit id, possibly multiple builds from the same commit etc..p  pSo, my questionp  pCan I just use a constant versionCode for nightly builds What consequences will this have apart from not being able to upload to Google Playp
Positive 78060 pHello everybody I face annoying error when, whenever I try to install this app I face many errors. Ok, per usual, I tried installing it through Google Play store but whenever I do so I get this errorp  blockquote   perror Package File is Invalidp blockquote  pOk, doing a bit of research into this error, most people have stated that it is usually a Google Play Error so I did the usual Open Google Play Store, clear the cache amp data and if fails then uninstall the app amp updates, clear the Google Play framework data amp cache and all other apps related to it and no luck. I have also done this several times as well p  pOk seeing as that failed, I then decided to install apk outside of Google play store  so I got the latest apk online and proceeded to install it on my phone  installing then I got THIS messagep  blockquote   pApplication Not Installedp blockquote  pI couldnt believe that didnt work, then I researched into what could be causing this error ROM, Cache, Checking Space, Maybe Even The App so yet again I did the usual I redownloaded the app several times, used such apps as Root Explorer, Astro and ES File Manager to install it, clear the cache partition from boot and just check to see if the unknown sources is checked but no luck.p  pI then tried to install the App via ADB and I just face even more errors.p  pI triedp  precodeCUsersSupportAppDataLocalAndroidandroidsdkplatformtoolsgtadb install Ccom.appnana.android.giftcardrewards.apk codepre  pand gotp  blockquote   pFailure [INSTALLFAILEDDEXOPT]   rm failed for f, Readonly file systemp blockquote  pResearched this and got no solution so I tried going around the methodp  precodeadb install r codepre  pGot the same errorp  blockquote   pFailure [INSTALLFAILEDDEXOPT]   rm failed for f, Readonly file systemp blockquote  pGuessing it was a readonly problem I searched for a way to rectify thisp  pcodeadb shell sysrwcode Got p  blockquote   psysrw permission deniedp blockquote  pEven triedp  precodeadb root codepre  pAnd Gotp  blockquote   padbd cannot run as root in production buildsp blockquote  pI couldnt find an answer to doing this so I tried doing other miscellaneous solutionsp  pTried codeadb shell  su  mount o rw,remount systemcode line by line and gotp  blockquote   pUsage mount [r] [w] [o options] [t type] device directoryp blockquote  pTried on my phone codemount o rw,remount t yaffs2 devblockmtdblock3 systemcode and gotp  blockquote   pmount not permittedp blockquote  pTried codeadb remountcode and gotp  blockquote   premount failed Operation not permittedp blockquote  pEven Tried as a way to beat this permission denied error codeadb shell whoamicode and gotp  blockquote   pwhoami permission deniedp blockquote  pI looked at super user with all permissions set to automatically grant before I did all of this, and I noticed that some of the permissions in the Super User where in red more specifically red rwsr xr x and tried to update the Su binaries but wouldnt let me so I went to SuperSU, and it deleted the SuperUser app, updated its self, updated the app and updated the binaries but still no luckp  pI thought it might be the SD Card so I switched SD Cards, backed up the data then formatted the SD Card by the phone since phones can be funny on FAT32 partitions if it was not partitioned by the phone and still no luck. Even tried Market Helper which worked on other apps which were way of Android 2.3 limitations but I still got the Package File is invalid error.p  pWhat could be wrong I installed the latest Java SDK with the latest ADB from Google. I installed the Samsung drivers and I have no luck. I cannot remember what tutorial I followed but root appears to be working fine. My phone is Samsung Galaxy Y S5360 and I still have the official 2.3.6 interface and I dont want to change that. Even when I install it on the online version of the app store I get error 906, what could be wrong The documentation of the app even says it supports 2.3 and upwards. Even if it could be the app thats the problem I still need to sort out this ADB for important future use. Please help and a step by step guide would be greatly appreciated so much  I worked really hard on this app and I want to continue to do so, and your help would be greatly appreciated. I dont mind doing whatever you suggest as long as I dont lose my app layout and app data unless you have a software which could back all of that up.p  pThank you so muchp  pDp  pPS. When I type devices on ADB is shows my device as 0123456789ABCDEF, is that unusual, I felt there should be more of a unique code to my phone than... that. Thank you Dp

Positive 78060 pUsing standard application update via Google Play, is it possible to define some preupdate actions Lets say, run a specific method inside application that do some work and then do update after it is finished, or maybe even block update if some criteria inside application logic is not met. p  pI can do that by implementing my own way of updating app without using Google Play to distribute app, but that is not an option this time. p  pIs there a Google Play option to do that, or maybe an event that can communicate to application if it is to be updated that can then trigger specific action inside app before updatep

Negative 78060 pneed your advices on this scenario I have a bunch of services installed on a server, they need to be set to start and stop dynamically depending on the local system time, meaning the start time and end time are different almost everyday, e.g, today these services are set to start by 9am and end by 9pm, and tomorrow could be 1030 am and 9pm.p  pstarttime and endtime are stored in an xml file that is generated on daily basisp  pSo, Im thinking about using another service to read the xml file and triggers the services accordingly, but it needs to be real time so it always monitors the local system time.p  pIf this is possible how exactly I should do to achieve this programatically p
