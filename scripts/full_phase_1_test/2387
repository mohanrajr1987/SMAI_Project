Positive 2387 pSimilar to banks, how would you implement a login page where the user has to enter the 3rd, 6th, and 9th letter of the password and if they are correct they can login.p  pNow this I can see is easy done if everything was plan text, however how would this be done with a one way encrypted password in the db. Id rather not have to decrypt it again. p  pHow would this be done How do banks do itp  pThanksp

Negative 2387 pIve got a JTable inside a JScrollPane inside a JPanel. I would like to make the rows of the JTable fill the entire height of the JPanel. Like, if i have 10 rows, they strech out in height direction and fill the entire JPanel, and and if i add 10 more rows, the rows should resize so i could fit all 20 rows in the JPanel.p  pIve managed to make the JScrollPane fill the entire height of the panel, but the table cells stay at a fixed size. Is there a way to do this I suppose it might be possible to fire an event upon resizing the window and then set the row height using the window height and number of rows, but it sounds like a lot of work so if there is an easier way to do this i would be very happy p
Negative 2387 pGood morning everyonep  pstrongWhat is happeningstrong  I currently have a website in which I allow users to upload files. They pick the location of where on the server the files get saved through choices they make.  The directory they end up picking is stored as a session variable. Once they click the upload button then the file is put to that directory. So far, no problem.  Initially I had problems with large files because of the settings in Apache. I changed the followingp  pUploadmaxfilesize  2M strongstrong Uploadmaxfilesize  0p  pmemorylimit  512M strongstrong memorylimit  1p  pThis is meant to allow the user to upload any file size. This works fine for files of 400MB or so no problem.  When I tested a 16GB file however is where the problem is.  I believe from my understanding that Apache is no longer limiting the upload by size and that changing the above settings must have helped otherwise my 400 MB file wouldnt work. p  pstrongProblemstrongp  pAfter the upload progress bar finishes, the page displays an error message that I have put in place if the directory location, saved in the session variable, is missing. Therefore I believe that the session may be timing out and forgetting the session variable. After the upload progress, which takes roughly an hour, is when the message is displayed.  p  pstrongWhat I have triedstrongp  pAfter doing some research I have tried changing the following, just to see if it made a difference evenp  psession.gcmaxlifetime  36000p  p36000 should  10 hours. I would not keep it here eventually but just did it for testing. Even changing this still results in what I believe is timing out. I was hoping someone had suggestions, and maybe other settings, that should be changed toop  pThanks in advancep
