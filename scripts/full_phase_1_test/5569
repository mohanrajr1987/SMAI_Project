Positive 5569 pI am new to Matlab and I am looking for your advice on what is a suitable or best ways to initialize a function   vs  or other options to be able to differentiate it, find a value at a specific argument and plot it as well as tangent lines at specific points.p  pThings I discoveredp  precodef  my functionx  but needs x initalized returns values difff, x plotx, f  f  x my function difff, x  doesnt work fplotf, x codepre  pAnd symbolicallyp  precodesyms x f  my function codepre  pbut I cant get values, differentiate or plot f yet in the last 2 cases.p
Positive 5569 pSay I have a function, codefoocode which has some arguments...some positional and some keywordp  precodedef fooa, b1.0, cNone     print a     print c     return 2  b codepre  pIs there another function I can call with codefoocode as an argument or a method of codefoocode which I can call that will return to me a list of the positional arguments of codefoocode as well as a list of tuples of the keyword arguments of foo along with their default values  Specifically, callingp  precodethefunctioniwantfoo codepre  pshould returnp  precodea,, b, 1.0, c, None codepre  pOr something like that.  To be clear I do emnotem want a way to figure out what values were passed to codefoocode one particular time that it was called.  Instead I want information about the function signature of codefoocode in a programatic way.  p  pThe use case I have in mind is to automatically make a web form which will be able to submit appropriate data to serve as the arguments of a specified function.  So that if I call codewebformfoocode in the appropriate way, it will be able to render a web form with spaces for each of the arguments of codefoocode with the default calling values prefilled in an appropriate way.p
Positive 5569 pIn JavaScript, I have an Object, defined in part of the code I cant touch. I know that you can take a Function and turn it into an Object, but havent been able to achieve the other way around.

However, I am still curious whether or not I can make an object also serve as a callable function, with the object already defined. This would be something likep  precodefunction mergeobj, func       Magic     return theMergedObjectAndFunctionHere  var o   foo bar  var f  function       alertthis.foo  var z  mergeo,f z  Alerts bar. codepre
Positive 5569 pI made a simple command line application based on Kaiji Ep. 16 that mimics the game Emperor Card for our midterms in basic programming. I got stuck on what I think is a simple problem, but I cant seem to solve it on my own. I have this function winCheckerList root, Node head, that checks what cards are drawn and who wins over who.p  pAnd it seems that it returns a wrong return value whenever I draw Citizen and the opponent draws Citizen as well. It should just loop, since Citizen vs Citizen is draw, according to my code.p  pCan you help me understand what Im doing wrong here. Also if you see some other mistakes, feel free to point them out.
