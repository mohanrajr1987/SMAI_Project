Positive 87 pIm having trouble multiplying a string by a variable that is a integer. Integer is in as variable form because it is an input that is entered by the user.

Positive 87 pSo, I have this printer that doesnt have drivers for any OS other than Windows, so, I wanted to run a server on a Windows PC that is attached to the printer, so that I can upload a file from any device in the local network and have a PHP script invoke MS Word on the file to print it. The command I have to invoke Word to print a document works when I give it from the command line and the file upload works, but when the command is run from the PHP script with codesystemcode or codeexeccode, it does not work. I see codeWINWORD.execode running from the Task Manager, but with no GUI showing and no printing happening. I am running the latest WAMP on Windows 8 and I have tried going into codeservices.msccode and changing the logon for wampapache to my user which is an administrator or enabling the checkbox to allow the service to interact with the desktop, but none of that worked. This is the actual command I am using codeCProgram FilesMicrosoft OfficeOffice14WINWORD.EXE Cpathfile.txt q n mFilePrintDefault mFileExitcode. Its in a batch file that I run using codeexeccodep  pEDIT I am not trying to print to a network printer, this is a printer that is connected to the server computer and I am using the newest version of WAMP, so I cant use the PHP functions in the linked question. Also, I am trying to print Word documents not raw text. This is specifically about PHPs codeexeccode not working for this case.p

Negative 87 pOften when feature testing in RSpecCucumber I want to emulate a sequence of related procedural user actions. For instance, a user might sign in, then update profile, then take some other action on the site, then sign out, and so on...p  pIn RSpec, an analogous feature test might look something like thisp  precodedescribe Step 1 Sign in do   before do      Capybara logic   end    describe Step 2 Visit settings page do     before do     end      describe Step 3 Update profile do       before do          More Capybaraetc...       end        describe Step 4 Making a new post do         before do            ......         end          describe Step 5 Viewing inbox do           before do              ...              More nested code etc, etc, etc...           end         end         end     end   end end codepre  pHowever, clearly this nesting very quickly gets out of control, especially when testing complex behavior on a site. Furthermore, the before blocks in the outermost nesting get run more times than then inner codebeforecode blocks, unnecessarily slowing down the test suite.p  pstrongSo, is there perhaps a more elegant way to handle thisstrong Im able to clean things up slightly by using codesharedexamplesforcode, codeitbehaveslikecode, codesharedcontextcode, codebeforeallcode, helper methods, etc. But it seems rather awkward when all I want to do is run the tests procedurally without each test needing to run in isolation. In other words, Im looking for a test DSL like thisp  precode Step 1 test Sign in do    visit signin    fillin whatever      ... end   Step 2 test Update profile, after Sign in do     Runs after Sign in sharing same context so variables and object states arent reset end codepre  pAnd yes I know in principle tests run in isolation, but lets be fair, doing so isnt always practical when each step in the test may rely on the outcome of a prior test. p

Any idea how I can populate that specific dropdownlist Thanks in advance, Lazialep  pUPDATEp  pIm starting a bounty because Im getting no results. This is what Im doingp  pIn the viewmodel Im adding one more propertyp  precode  public ListltSelectListItemgt StockSelectList codepre  pIn the controller Im setting the propertyp  precode            ListltSelectListItemgt itemsInStockSelectList  new ListltSelectListItemgt                        for int x  0 x lt itemsList.Items.Count x                              var selectItem  new SelectListItem                 selectItem.Text  itemsList.Items[x].InStockNow.ToString                 selectItem.Text  itemsList.Items[x].InStockNow.ToString                 itemsInStockSelectList.AddselectItem                              codepre  pUsing this approach Im setting the values but I need to set for each item in the category, maybe I can use one more property to get the categoryID and the itemID for the SelectItemListp  pAnd in the view I tried this approachp  precode Html.DropDownListFork gt i.InStockNow, m.StockSelectList codepre  pAnd as I said Im getting same values for all the items.

Negative 87 pWe have this architecture with 2 node processes. p  pOne polls a private API and pushes the changes to the second node if any. The second node process the data and calls a bunch other APIs and eventually emits a change event to the client, a HTML5 website, with socket.iop  pThis second node will always process the data and will always emit changes even if no clients are connected. So in my opinion the CPU or mem usage is not that greatly affected by the number of connected clients. Also note that this architecture is still running on a private staging environment.p  pEverything runs fine and were ready to go live until we noticed after couple of days, maybe a week, the second node suddenly gets extremely slow while the first node is still fine.p  pIt gets so bad that even the connection between the two nodes gets timed out and they are on the same network over localhost. It also takes more then 10 seconds to browse to the socket.iosocket.io.js file.p  pI know its very hard to understand the problem without seeing any code but Im kinda pulling my hair out because we have to go live in couple of days and my logs are not revealing anything and google isnt helping either.p  pstrongWhats a good practice towards building Have you ever experienced anything like this What was the problem and how did you fix itstrongp  pstrongWhats a good monitor and profiler for node.js preferably freestrongp  pstrongWhat are good practices towards building a node.js app with makes a lot of outgoing API callsstrongp  pAnything or anyone that could help me in the right direction of solving or even discovering the actual problem will be greatly appreciatedp  pThank youp
