Positive 1704 pI am working with TeXStudio, which runs on MacTeX on my Mac. I have been searching for a way to specify the output folder for pdflatex, because I do not want to have the log files to be in the same folder with my tex file. p  pI have tried to use outputdirectorytarget .tex in PreferenceCommandpdflatex, together with setting the paths for the log and pdf files.

Positive 1704 h1The goalh1  pIm looking for a markup language for writing documentation that would support a very flexible codeINCLUDEcodelike directive that can target specific elements of an included file or resource. The markup language should also have some LaTeX and ideally also HTML exporter. However, the elements should be included from the file as they are without any additional tagging of the elements. p  pOne additional requirement is to be able to use LaTeX math fragments as this is to be used in academia.p  h2Example usageh2  pFor example, I may have several documents about specific components of a device and one day I decide I want to create a report about certain aspects of certain components. Using this codeINCLUDEcodelike directive I would include the paragraphsresourcesnodes from the various documents and then export it to PDF through LaTeX.p  h1Research so farh1  pIve had a look at most of the common markup and even nonmarkup languages and most do have something like and codeINCLUDEcode directive, but usually its only capable of including whole files or at best a range of lines from a file. However, line ranges are very brittle and may become quickly obsolete if the included document is e.g. extended.p  pHere I list some of the most promising candidatesp  h2EMACS Orgmodeh2  pIve been playing around with the newly extended codeINCLUDEcode directive a hrefhttporgmode.orgChanges.htmlorgheadline21 relnofollowfunctionality in Orgmode version 8.3 for extracting parts of filesa, documented a hrefhttporgmode.orgmanualIncludefiles.html relnofollowin the manuala and an example is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25895721orgmodeincludeheadingin the answer of this questiona.p  precodeINCLUDE .otherfile.orgHeadline text codepre  h2LaTeXh2  pThe closest alternative I found in LaTeX is a hrefhttpswww.ctan.orgpkgcatchfilebetweentags relnofollowcatchfilebetweentagsa, but that requires adding the tags in the file being included. p  pIve also seen people use codedefresourceIDresource contentcode to define the nodes in files and then include the files where needed and expand the required macros. This approach requires an even less elegant way of marking the elements.p  h2XML with Xincludeh2  pAs discussed in this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions5121052canweimportxmlfileintoanotherxmlfileXML inclusion questiona, the a hrefhttpwww.w3.orgTRxincludedtinclusiontarget relnofollowXInclude extensiona offers something quite close to what I would want, because on can easily targe ta XML nodes and structures as XML is well designed for that. However, XML is strongNOTstrong designed to be a markup language for writing documentation AFAIK. Or is there some XML doctype andor interface that is often used for documentation purposes these daysp  pIm aware of DocBook, but editing XML files is certainly not userfriendly. Or is there some good frontend these days It seems LyX might be even able to use MathML in the result.p

Negative 1704 pWhile totally unrelated at first, a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comq268974981093528this questiona made me wonder...p  pJavas regexes are based on codeStringcodes codeStringcodes are sequences arrays of codecharcodes and codecharcodes are ultimately UTF16 code units.p  pThe latter means that a single codecharcode can match any Unicode code point inside the BMP, ie from U0000 to UFFFF.p  pOutside the BMP however, two codecharcodes are required for a single code point one for the leading surrogate, another for the trailing surrogate from what I can see, apart from a dedicated grammar engine, I dont see a way for Java regexes as defined by a hrefhttpdocs.oracle.comjavase8docsapijavautilregexPattern.html relnofollowcodejava.util.regex.Patterncodea to define character classes for such code points, since there is no String literal for code points outside the BMP.p  pNotwithstanding that code emcanem be written to produce regexes well, string literals used as regexes for such ranges, is there an existing mechanism in codePatterncode which is not documented and allows to do thatp
