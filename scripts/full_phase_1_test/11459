Positive 11459 pAttending to its specification, JSON elements and javascript objects are unordered so, even in almost all cases, when you iterate over a javascript object, you get elements in the same order they was defined you definitively cannot trust in that order because engine is allowed to alter it.p  pThis is extremely rare. I have been able to observe it one time, but I dont find that code right now and I dont remember the exact version of JS engine but it was node. If I manage to find it, I will add it to this post.p  pThat being said, the point is that code relying in this behaviour can and should be considered buggy because, even it will work as expected in most engines, it may fail typically because of internal engine optimisations.p  pFor examplep  precodeuse strict var x       b 23,     a 7   function someSortinginput      var output       Object.keysinput.sort.map         functionk             output[k]  input[k]                   return output   x  someSortingx  Some smart engine could notice that input and output objects have the  exact same properties and guess that, attending the unordered nature of  javascript Object, there is no need to actually execute someSorting  console.logx  Usually will display  a 7, b 23   But perfectly we could got  b 23, a 7  codepre  pstrongI knowstrong there is too many literature even StackOverflow questions about this NON issue and workarrounds to achieve the expected behaviour by sorting keys in a separate array.p  pBut doing so code goes too messy compared in simply trusting in key order.p  pIm pretty sure that this can be achieved in a more elegant fashion by implementing a socalled sObject alternative having native Object as its prototype but overloading its native iterator and setter so thatp  ul liWhen any new property is added, its key is appended to an Array index mantained under the hood.li liWhen an sObject eminstanceem is iterated, our customized iterator uses that index to retrieve elements in the right order.li ul  pstrongIn summarystrong Actual Object specification is right because, in most cases, properties order doesnt care. So I think that engine optimisations that could mess it are wonderfull.p  pBut it would be also wonderful to have an alternative emsObjectem with which we could do something likep  precodevar x  new sObjectb 23, a 7 codepre  p...and trust that we could iterate it strongin the same exactstrong order or, also  at least, do some sorting task over it and trust that this will not be altered.p  pstrongOf coursestrong Im initalyzing it with a native javascript Object so, in fact, theoretically we cant trust that it will be populated right even I cant imagine why any engine emoptimisationem should alter it before any operation.p  pI used that notation for brevity and, I confess because I expect that, in that case emshouldem work always even Im not really sure. However we even could sort it later which, in most cases we will do that way or use other kind of initialization like providing a JSON string or an array of objects or arrays with single key and value pairs.p  pMy concern is Such a thing exists yet I wasnt able to find it. But sure Im not the first guy thinking in that...p  pI can try to implement it Im thinking about that. I think its possible and that I could achieve it. But its not as simple so first I want to be sure that Im not reinventing the wheel...p  pSo any comments, suggestions, etc... will be welcome.p

Positive 11459 pIve been stuck at this problem for a long time now and couldnt find help anywhere else on web, so this might prove useful to someone else later.p  pI have a list of words and every word in list has its own two arrays of words it should go before and after.p  pHeres an examplep  precodeforest  beforetree frog  aftermushroom mushroom leaf  aftermushroom, before frog tree  beforemushroom codepre  pThese words should be ordered in following order forest, tree, mushroom, leaf, frog. So basically, after doesnt mean that a word needs to go right after another one neither does before, it just cant go before said word or after in before case.p  pI tried solving this problem by using array lists and adding elements at custom indices, that breaks as soon as an element like leaf is inserted element that goes between two other elements.p  pThis example has been simplified so it doesnt confuse anyone, Im actually writing a mod loader that sorts methods whose annotation says which mods they should execute afterbefore.p  pEDIT I managed to solve the problem by turning before into after on elements contained in before arrays.p  pAfter that, all I did was iterate over all elements and then check if that element was executed already Youll see why in a second, if it wasnt executed, execute all after elements first in the same manner and then execute the actual element. I also do some checking to prevent cycles and such.p

Negative 11459 pI have two List objects, one recording passes and one recording failures for parts. I build two separate lists because they are displayed separately in an Excel spreadsheet.p  pBoth lists contain codeReportDatacode objects, which have fieldsp  precodeDataDate DateTime quantity int rejected int cumulativeQuantity int cumulativeRejected int codepre  pIn the pass list, I record the date, the quantity, and the cumulativeQuantity passed up to that date. The rejected and cumulativeRejected values are set to zero. I do the opposite for the failed list.p  pAt the end, I would like to combine them to get one codeListltReportDatagtcode object that has all of the dates.p  pI do not want to intersect the lists, because technically there are no intersections. While the date may exist in both, the objects are not the same. I considered looping through the pass list, and looking for dates that exist in the failures, and then recording their rejected and cumulativeRejected values. The issue this leads to is that if there are dates that do not exist, I may not know what to set codecumulativeRejectedcode to for that date.p  pAnother problem is if an item exists in failures but not passes. In practice, this emshouldntem happen, but for intents and purposes of this example it could.p  pIs there a way to do this Its almost a combination of both an intersect and a union of lists, and I dont know what to do.p  pstrongEDITstrongp  pIf that is a little unclear, consider two listsp  precodepass    DataDate 050115 quantity 10 cumQuantity 10 rejected 0 cumRejected 0    DataDate 050215 quantity 15 cumQuantity 25 rejected 0 cumRejected 0    DataDate 050315 quantity 10 cumQuantity 35 rejected 0 cumRejected 0    DataDate 050415 quantity 15 cumQuantity 50 rejected 0 cumRejected 0  fail    DataDate 050115 quantity 0 cumQuantity 0 rejected 10 cumRejected 10    DataDate 050215 quantity 0 cumQuantity 0 rejected 10 cumRejected 20    DataDate 050315 quantity 0 cumQuantity 0 rejected 10 cumRejected 30    DataDate 050515 quantity 0 cumQuantity 0 rejected 10 cumRejected 40 codepre  pHow can I obtain a final list that looks like thisp  precodetotal    DataDate 050115 quantity 10 cumQuantity 10 rejected 10 cumRejected 10    DataDate 050215 quantity 15 cumQuantity 25 rejected 10 cumRejected 20    DataDate 050315 quantity 10 cumQuantity 35 rejected 10 cumRejected 30    DataDate 050415 quantity 15 cumQuantity 50 rejected 0 cumRejected 30    DataDate 050515 quantity 0 cumQuantity 50 rejected 10 cumRejected 40 codepre
