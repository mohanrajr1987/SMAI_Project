Positive 5647 pOur solution has many dependencies that are not references, they are script files whole Python projects using code.pyprojcode and DLLs loaded using reflection MEF actually.p  pWe are using post build events to copy those files to the correct output directory when compiling the main exe. This has become unwieldy since we now have multiple entry exes that need those files and the amount of copies done is unmanageable. p  pThis creates two problems first, synchronizing all the projects to use the same sequence of post build events second, xcopying the files seems to fail sometimes and from our experience is not always reliable.p  pAre there more manageable alternatives for copying build outputs at compile time without using xcopy in post build eventsp

Positive 5647 pFor one of our build scripts TFS 2013, when we run it manually or during CheckIn Continuous Integration trigger, the build script is not picking up the latest code changes. We looked in the logs and it does have the correct changeset number for the impacted files in this case .vb files. We tried with several different .vb files. We also tried recreating the build script from scratch to no avail. We have several other build scripts for similar web applications that have no issues with the same build settings. This project builds fine. We set the Clean Build to True. Configurations is set to Any CPURelease. Output Location is set to SingleFolder. Build Template is set to TfvcTemplate.12.xaml.

Positive 5647 pWe are using TFS Build 2013 and I am configuring our build strategy. We want to keep it as default as possible, so we want to use the default build process template without any custom activities. Instead we have some Powershell scripts, which are connected to the default template.

Negative 5647 pA compiler that must translate a generic type or method in any language, not just Java has in principle two choices p  blockquote   pCode specialization. The compiler generates a new representation for   every instantiation of a generic type or method. For instance, the   compiler would generate code for a list of integers and additional,   different code for a list of strings, a list of dates, a list of   buffers, and so on. p      pCode sharing. The compiler generates code for only one representation   of a generic type or method and maps all the instantiations of the   generic type or method to the unique representation, performing type   checks and type conversions where needed.p blockquote  pJava uses strongcode sharingstrong method.
