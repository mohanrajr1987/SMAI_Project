Positive 8512 pIm having a hard time believing this isnt a dupe, but I cant find emanyem posts answering this question, so Ill try to make it a good one.p  pEssentially the problem is this you have a matrix of size codeRow X Columncode and your number of processors is codePcode.  The max size of your partition the number of elements each processor is allocated is codeRowsColumnsprocessors1code, and youll have to do some logic to make sure you dont go out of bounds.  Each processor is assigned a starting point and must jump forward codePcode indexes.p  pSo on a 4x4 matrix which is sequentially numbered like the followingbrp  blockquote   p[1] [2] [3] [4]br       [5] [6] [7] [8]br       [9] [10][11][12]br       [13][14][15][16]p blockquote  pa processor with id code0code would get 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16. the max partition size.p  pThe algorithm my instructor gave us is like thisp  blockquote   pi  columns  row and i  columns  column p blockquote  pThis worked for the examples he gave us like code6  4  1code and code6  4  2code so 6 is at index code[1][2]code The logic is intuitive at least, but fails on several occasions.p  pSo what is an algorithm which can reliably produce the indexes of the desired values on an codeNxMcode matrixp
