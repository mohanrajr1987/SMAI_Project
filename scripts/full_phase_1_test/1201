Positive 1201 pI moved a working OpenVPN server from our onpremises infrastructure to Azure. The configuration of the vpn server onpremises and on Azure are absolutely the same. Same settings, same IP range. The configuration is the same as the vpn server is in a vhd. I just uploaded the same vpn to Azure. Onpremises all vpn clients can ping all hosts in the internal vpn ip range and all hosts in the internal ip range can ping all clients. In Azure, however, at least according to tcpdump, clients go to all hosts, but the hosts cant route back through the vpn server. All routing tables are the same as the onpremises configuration. Its like Azure does not let me route back though the vpn server. Has anyone else been in the same situation p
