Negative 84138 pWe had a major outage today in production where memory was disappearing very quickly from our webservers. This was traced back to a caching mechanism in Ninject I think it was Activation Cache or something  not totally sure. After investigating the issue we came to the conclusion that we had a circular reference in our scope callback.p  precodeclass View      Presenter presenter      View              service locators are smelly, but webforms forces this uglyness         this.presenter  ServiceLocator.GetltFuncltView, Presentergtgtthis          this.presenter.InitUI        class Presenter      CookieContainer cookieContainer     View view      PresenterView view, CookieContainer cookieContainer              this.view  view         this.cookieContainer  cookieContainer        class CookieContainer      HttpRequest request     HttpResponse response       CookieContainer              this.request  HttpRequest.Current.Request         this.response  HttpRequest.Current.Response        BindltFuncltView, Presentergtgt.ToMethodctx gt view gt          ctx.Kernel.GetltPresentergtnew ConstructorArgumentview, view  BindltPresentergt.ToSelf.InTransientScope BindltCookieContainergt.ToSelf.InRequestScope codepre  pThis is a representation of our code that was causing the issue. Seemingly what happened was the scope callback for the CookieContainer was HttpContext.Current, and HttpContext.Current was also being referenced by CookieContainer. So Ninject could never prune CookieContainer instances from its cache, as the CookieContainer instances where keeping their scope callback objects alive. When we change CookieContainers scope to transient, all works fine, as we expected. But Im still not totally sure why this happened as it seems like this is a fairly conventional thing to do right Maybe not perhaps...p  pI am also confused as I thought that if the callback object stayed alive as it did, then shouldnt Ninject just hand back the same instance from the cache, seeing as though the callback was still alive, so the instance should appear to be in scope Why would ninject keep getting new instances of CookieContainer and caching them I guess there would be other issues related to the incorrect object coming back, but that would at least just be a bug, not a memory leak. p  pMy question is a have we diagnosed this error correctly b is there a recommended approach to take for this not to happen again c Can I put a fix in to the code to check for this type of circular dependancy assuming we have diagnosed this correctlyp
