Negative 265 pMany times, Ive used the codeconstcode and codemutablecode concept in C to create const or mutable types of objects, similar to codeiteratorcode vs codeconstiteratorcode.  The point is to provide different types of views const or mutable views over other objects.  The general idea is that a mutableobject is convertible to a constobject, but a constobject is NOT convertible to a mutableobject, just like codeiteratorcode vs. codeconstiteratorcode.p  pThis is very easy to achieve, by simply creating two types, and for the const type, you create a nonexplicit constructor that takes a mutable typep  precodeclass mutableobject      public     mutableobject  default   class constobject      public      constobject  default     constobjectconst constobjectamp  default      constobjectmutableobject m         void functionthattakesaconstobjectconstobject    void functionthattakesamutableobjectmutableobject    int main      constobject c     mutableobject m     functionthattakesaconstobjectc     functionthattakesaconstobjectm  works      functionthattakesamutableobjectm     functionthattakesamutableobjectc  will fail  codepre  pSo, this is simple enough, and it nicely reproduces the C semantics of const vs. mutable types, like codeconstiteratorcode vs codeiteratorcode.p  pbrp  pBut, I tried to replicate this using class template types that take variadic template arguments, but cant get it to workp  precodetemplate ltclass...

Im not exactly sure why, but I guess it has to do with the fact that more than one deduction would need to take place, first deducing the types for codeT...code, and then finding a suitable conversion construction.p  pSo, is there any way to write a conversion constructor for codemutableobjectltT...gt gt constobjectltT...gtcode that will enable the compiler to properly bind a function call to codeFOOcode, where we pass codeFOOcode an instance of codemutableobjectltT...gtcodep
