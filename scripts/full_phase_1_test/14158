Positive 14158 pIm trying to call an Azure API App configured with Azure AD authentication. Assume for the purposes of this question I cannot use the Azure SDK and need to write code to get a token and insert it into the API request.p  pI have established that there are two modes  client flow and server flow, where client flow entails following at least one redirect to an issuer to get a token, and server flow where the server does this for you. Since Im talking about doing this in code, following redirects would be possible but fiddly, so Id prefer to use a mode where the URI or URIs to visit are known ahead of time and return content, rather than redirecting. The following diagram illustrates how the gateway routes all requests.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comoB1qn.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comoB1qn.png altAPI app credential flowap  pI think the mode I need is client flow, which would go something likep  ul liGet an access token from the identity provider which is what how do I find out where this resides what is the format of the request I have to send to the IdPli liPass the access token to the gateway in what formatli liReceive another token in the gateway responseli liSupply this token in a header when making an API request which headerli ul  pHow am I supposed to do this The Azure documentation doesnt give enough detail about how it works, and expects all users to just use the SDK, which hides what is actually happening.p  pemThe actual reason is that ultimately this will need to be called from BizTalk, which uses the WCF WebHttpBinding to call restful services. Im writing a custom behaviour to insert a token header into the request, but I need to know how this token should be acquired. Its possible to run arbitrary code in BizTalk but trying to do this makes the solution complicated, and configonly or mostlyconfig with minimal, looselycoupled code is the simpler solutionemp

Positive 14158 pI have a few WCF Web Services that I would like to test in Azures staging area instead of deploying directly to the production area.  p  pHeres the setupp  pI have two cloud services a hrefhttps1.cloudapp.net relnofollowhttps1.cloudapp.neta and a hrefhttps2.cloudapp.net relnofollowhttps2.cloudapp.neta.  These cloud service endpoints are endpoints in a traffic manager a hrefhttpsmycloudapps.trafficmanager.net relnofollowhttpsmycloudapps.trafficmanager.neta.  I have a DNS alias of a hrefhttpsmycloudapps.com relnofollowhttpsmycloudapps.coma mapped to the traffic manager url.p  pMy client is setup to establish an SSL connection using the certificate for a hrefhttpsmycloudapps.com relnofollowhttpsmycloudapps.coma.  p  pWhen I deploy to staging I edit my host file to use the staging ip to point to a hrefhttpsmycloudapps.com relnofollowhttpsmycloudapps.coma and if I ping a hrefhttpsmycloudapps.com relnofollowhttpsmycloudapps.coma I get the staging areas ip returned.  Yet when I call the services with my test client I am still hitting the endpoints behind the traffic manager url.p  pAdditionally, I have tried mapping the traffic manager url to the same virtual ip of the staging environment  but I get the same result.p  pHow can I call wcf services in Azures staging environment in this scenariop  pI havent had much luck on the web... Any help would be appreciated.p

Positive 14158 pWe have an IoT service running on Azure which produces a lot of events. We need to build a new feature which allows our enduser to configure alerts based on system events. It allows the user to pick an event and configure an action email, webhook, etc to be executed when such an event occurs. Were evaluating Azure Eventhub and possibly Azure Stream Analtyics as candidates for the job. p  pThe problem we face is We think we will get a lot of stream analytics jobs running. When for example we have 3000 customers each configuring 3 alerts we need to run 9000 stream analtyics jobs which select specific events from the eventhub pushing it in a queue which does the alert processing. This will not only be a tough maintenance job, but I think it not a really cost effective solution.p  pAny thoughts on this or better solutionsp
