Positive 2631 pThere are a handful of questions on SO that look similar, but I cannot figure out some behaviour and I am looking for help. p  pBelow is a snippet from a batch file I am trying to write which will load in a set of directories and potentially replace letter substitutions with an expanded path, e.g. the properties file might look like p  pre classlangdos prettyprintoverridecodelocation1CTest location2[m]Test codepre  pWhere codelocation1code points to codeCTestcode and codelocation2code points to codeCProgram Filesx86MODULETestcode, because code[m]code is a shorthand to codeCProgram Filesx86MODULEcode.p  pThe batch script, to this point, is simply trying to read in the list of file paths and expandreplace the [m].p  pre classlangdos prettyprintoverridecodeSET build.dirdp0  SET progfilesPROGRAMFILESX86 IF progfiles SET progfilesProgramFiles  SET local.propertiesbuild.dirlocal.properties  SETLOCAL ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION FOR F tokens1 delims i IN local.properties DO      SET local.dirj    SET local.dirlocal.dir[m]progfilesMODULE  echo local.dir  ENDLOCAL codepre  pRunning this kicks out an errorp  blockquote   pMODULE was unexpected at this time.p blockquote  pIf I replace the FOR with the following insteadp  pre classlangdos prettyprintoverridecodeset test[m]ProjDir set testtest[m]progfilesMODULE echo test codepre  pI get the desired codeCProgram Filesx86MODULEProjDircode printed out...so Im confused why it works fine outside of the codeFORcode loop.p  pMy understanding about delayed expansion is that it expands at runtime...which you get to happen using codecode instead of codecode wrapped around the variable. Furthermore, as Im creating the codelocal.dircode variable inside the codeFORcode loop scope, I must use delayed expansion in order to access it with the updated value for the iteration.p  pI feel like the problem is using codeprogfilescode, like theres some special syntax I need to use in order to make it work but nothing is adding up for me.

Negative 2631 pI want to localize a meteor app by detecting browser language, and also a change language option on homepage. p  pTo do this, I thought I detect the browser language and set a session value e.g. currentlang  enUS, and have some helper methods that read the texts according to the locale this session value contains.  So I would have e.g. a JS object on the client called Resources that contains some arrays e.g. enUS  [res1key res1value, res2key res2Value] and a helper method to retrieve them by key. p  pMy question is is this a good approach to localize a meteor app, or does meteor already have something like this that is done underthehood, e.g. Im sure they thought about localization so far but I just cant find anything in the docs referring to it. p  pThanks.p
