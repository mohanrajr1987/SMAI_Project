Positive 16383 pIm developing a kind of home automation app for iOS. Im currently running into a spacing problem that I want to have a nice solution to.p  pThe app is always showing a navigation bar and a tab bar, which is quite space consuming. This is a big problem on the current page Im implementing, which is the Graphs page. In portrait, the spacing is decent, but in landscape mode, I feel like the graphs should be bigger and take up more space than in portrait mode, which is simply not possible with the tab bar and navigation bar.p  pSo my initial thoughts here are if its allowed to hide either the tab bar or navigation bar when in landscape mode and keep them in portrait mode. What will Apples reviewers think of this and what will the users think Will they be confused Do you guys have any other possible solutions to this p  pIm developing on a iPhone 4C which is quite small. Im sure it wouldnt be a problem on the iPhone 6, but these small screens needs to be supported.p  pThanks for some input on this.p

Positive 16383 pSo currently Im making a news app for iPhone, and I want to create a custom navigation and tab bars for it. So I switched off my standard navigation bar and toolbar in Navigation Controller to add new custom ones. But the problem is that after I add this bars to my TableView where the RSS feed is displayed and trying to scroll it up and down my bars move along with feed.p  pIs there any option to lock my bars on top and bottom of the screen respectively So I can scroll feed in between them Sorry, was not sure what kind of information I need to provide, my bad.
