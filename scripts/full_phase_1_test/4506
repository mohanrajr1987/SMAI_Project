Positive 4506 pIm using slimerjs to render some html files.

I really dont like this solution, coz I need to render multiple pages, some of them are very small, and could take less than 200 milliseconds, others are huge and could take more than 5000, so this is just bad for perfomances and isnt even a safe solution against page taking a long time to render.

Positive 4506 pI am working on a GUI application with Java and SWT.brI have createad a main window with a canvas in which I load an image well its a PDF page converted to image.brI have attached a PaintListener to the canvas and when i drag the mouse onte the canvas I am able to draw a rectangle.br When i release the left button on mouse, I want a dialog window to came out to fine setting the rectangle area, so I made a dialog with 4 spinner x, y, width and height.br Now I want to click on the spinners and the canvas redraw the changed rectangle area.brI tried to pass the canvas object to the dialog window and attach a second paint listener to it So I have one paintlistener from MainWindow.java and another from Dialog.java, but its no working.br The problem is that I have multiple rectangle drawn on the canvas, and if I call canvas.redraw from dialog window, the rectangles already drawn on canvas disappeared.brbrWhat is the best practise in such situationbr I thinks to put the dialog window in the toolbar, that is put the 4 spinners in the toolbar or another area in the main window so I have only one paint listener and get rid of the dialog, but I prefer the dialog cause it is impratical to drag a rectangle onto canvas and then move the mouse to click on toolbar.brbr Thanks in advance, Maurop

Positive 4506 pIm making a little painting app using codecanvascode and when drawing in the canvas everything is fine, but as soon as the user leaves the bounds of the canvas everything on the page is selected.p  pThis doesnt happen in Firefox. Ive showed the app so far to a couple people and every single one of them have mentioned how annoying it is. Ive read around and apparently I could putp  precodemozuserselect none webkituserselect none userselect none codepre  pon every single div on the page but that seems like overkill. Also, I users to be able to select things on the page. It works perfectly in Firefox and doesnt select anything when leaving the canvas but for some reason in Chrome when drawing in the canvas the cursor changes to the selection cursor while drawing and upon leaving the canvas with left mouse button still held down everything gets selected.p  pIs this possible to fixp
Positive 4506 pIm trying to create a Tri Peaks Solitaire game in Javascript, using CreateJS to help interact with the HTML canvas.  Im not entirely new to programming, as Ive taken college courses on Java and C, but I am new to both Javascript and HTML.  p  pI created a large amount of the card game using a Card class and Deck class, with the image adding, event listening, and game logic done in one Javascript file, but this resulted in a lot of messy, somewhat buggy code that I felt needed cleaning up. p  pIm trying to implement a separate class for the card table, which will be the canvas, or stage, and it will draw the 4 rows of playable cards, the stock pile, and the waste pile.

Positive 4506 pIm pretty new to web development, in fact Im thinking of diving into html and js for game developing.p  pSo, before doing anything, I need to know whether or not the canvas element in html5 is hardware accelerated. If its not, then I would need to use something like webgl I dont know if it matters, but the browser Im using is firefoxmaybe it varies between browsersp  pIt might seem stupid, but its an important question, specially since in games you have a bunch of 2d sprites being drawed all around. Thanks in advancep

Negative 4506 pHello again everybody on here p  pSo we just finally got gps data to go from an android device to a database using php to pass the array into the table. Awesome.p  pNow I need to pull the data out of the table and do one of two things that I can think of.p  ol lipI can modify my existing php page using fwrite to write the incoming data to another php page which would act like a db table itself.....which is kind of defeating the purpose of having things stored in the db.pli lipI can create a php page that I have the device hit when it wants to pull all the gps marks from the db. This Im not sure how to do at the moment.pli ol  pMy problem is for the first method Im a little unsure of how efficient space wise this would be vs. just pulling stuff from the db and also Im not to sure how to set up the variables in so that fwrite actually writes them in the json format I needp  pIn order to use fwrite and get things to write to the new page correctly would I use it like thisp  precodemyFile  testFile.php fh  fopenmyFile, w or diecant open file stringData   lat , lat,  n fwritefh, stringData stringData   long , long,  n fwritefh, stringData fclosefh codepre  pFor the second method Im not sure really where to start. I have the gps info stored in a table within a mysql database so I would need a php script that returns the all the gps marks in the table to the user so they appear on the device. Also very soon well be moving to a postgresql database so help on doing that too would be great.p  pOnce again any help would be much appreciated p
