Positive 889 pI have a case where a Java application uses Secur32Util.getUserNameEx from jna to obtain the username in a format for a singlesignon. There are some machines where this function call is executing for a few minutes. I was not able to figure out why that is yet. But in the meantime, I would like to ask if there is a replacement that can be used to substitute that call.p  pTo start the discussion, I have already tested that NTSystemgetName and NTSystemgetDomain return immediately on the machine that is stuck on executing Secur32Util.getUserNameEx. Are those functions interchangeablep

Negative 889 pSo I have worked with Multithreading in small application. Create a new thread here, a new thread there.p  pIm currently working on a program that monitors an IRC chat. For every valid command it creates a thread, does some work, and outputs the result to the chat. At times the application will get 10  or more valid commands in a short time and 10 or more threads are created. The application starts to really slow down. Ive read that creating and closing threads is very cost inefficient with resources so I want to change my method.p  pAn idea Ive had is to create some threads 5 or so that are always running with a method that I pass commands to that queues them in a FIFO basis. Before I implemented this I wanted to see if there is something better I should be using. I dont want to run off and reinvent the wheel, of course.p
