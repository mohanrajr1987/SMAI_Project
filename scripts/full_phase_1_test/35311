Positive 35311 pI have developed a SOAP Service on basis of C and .NET 4.0 codeservice.dllcode. The service internally loads a C DLL codecpp.dllcode and does stuff. I deployed that on an IIS 7.5 running on Windows 7 and it all worked well. However, recently the service stopped working.p  pIf I now try to create a service using the codewcftestclientcode application shipped with Visual Studio, I get following error messagep  blockquote   pWarning There were errors loading types in an assembly loaded from   CWindowsassemblyGACMSILSystem.ServiceModel3.0.0.0b77a5c561934e089System.ServiceModel.dll   some types in the assembly could not be loaded and will not be   available to the tool.Error An error occurred in the tool.Error   Object reference not set to an instance of an object.p blockquote  pI did not touch emanyem of the DLLs or so. Googling the error message didnt lead me anywhere, so Im desperate now and would appreciate some help with this. What does the message mean and what should I investigatep  pI can open a hrefhttpmyservermyserviceservice.svcwsdl relnofollowhttpmyservermyserviceservice.svcwsdla and it shows me the correct WSDL. Also, I have a command line tool which itself loads the codecpp.dllcode and this works too, so the problem cannot be there. It has to be something with the codeservice.dllcode or with the settings in IIS or with a recent Windows update screwing up my .NET environment... right p
Positive 35311 pI am migrating a website which iswill be running on IIS and I will be using rewrite maps to 301 redirect old .asp URLs to a new style of URL. For many thousands of URLs there is no pattern, so it appears I must rely on rewrite maps.p  pMy problem is that the default web.config size limit is 250kb, and in my environment, I dont have access to change this as can be done at the registry level  if one had access.p  pI have looked into moving the rewriteMaps section to an external file, but the external files also have the default size limit of 250kg, so this is also not going to work.p  pI am looking for some other way to handle this...

So my approach was to turn the initial Strings each into an array since the assignment specified each string would be exactly N elements long, in this case N  10 where 1 letter would be 1 element.  The next thing I did was set up a for loop that would scan s1Array and add the first 4 elements to an ArrayList subStr which is used to search s2Array and s3Array.  Here is where .add isnt a valid method, for whatever reason.  Commenting that out and compiling again, I also ran into an issue with the .contains method not being a valid method.  Why wont this work  What am I missing  Logically, it seems to make sense but I guess maybe Im missing something in the syntax  Help would be appreciated, as Im a Java novice.p
