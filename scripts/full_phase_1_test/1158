Positive 1158 pIm having quite a bit of trouble defining new object types through QML documents and then trying to use those types. For context, I have a main.qml that uses the MyMenu to add MyMenu to a list of menus. That part is working fine.p  pFrom there, I create a MyWindow component from MyMenu.qml, and in MyWindow.qml I try to use AutoTab.qml as a type so that I can break apart the tabs into individual files.p  pThe problems I am running into seem to be related to the use of the QRC file. If I dont give MyWindow an alias, I get the error that the file is not found.

Positive 1158 pI routinely use PyDev in Eclipse for Python development.  However, Im trying PyQt for the first time in the same environment.  It works well, with one exception.  If the program errors out anywhere within the Qt main event loop, including within my own code, no error information is output to the PyDev console.p  pTo demonstrate this I created the following simple PyQt appp  precodeimport sys from PyQt5 import uic from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication   test.ui contains a single Push Button named pushButton base, form  uic.loadUiType..uitest.ui   class MainWindowbase, form     def initself, parentNone         superbase, self.initparent         self.setupUiself         self.pushButton.clicked.connectself.buttonpressed      def buttonpressedself         printbutton pressed         printinvalidvariable  intentional error         pass  if name  main     app  QApplicationsys.argv     app.setStylefusion     mainwindow  MainWindow     mainwindow.show     sys.exitapp.exec codepre  pIf I place an intentional error such as codeprintinvalidvariablecode anywhere after codeif name  maincode and before the codeapp.execcode command, the program properly terminates with a traceback and the expected codeNameError name invalidvariable is not definedcode.  However, if I press the button in my dialog using the above code, codebutton pressedcode appears on the console but then the application terminates silently and with no error information in the console.  Other debugging operations, such as breakpoints and expressions, work fine.p  pIs this expected behavior  If so, what do you recommend for facilitating debugging of PyQt apps in this environment.  If not, Id appreciate insight into what I need to do to rectify the problem.p  ul liPython version python3.4.3.amd64 li liPyDev version PyDev for Eclipse 4.3.0.201508182223 li liPyQt version PyQt55.5gplPy3.4Qt5.5.0x64li ul  hr  pUpdate strong20150930strongp  pWhen I run the test app directly with python.exe, it outputs the error correctly to strongstderrstrong in both error scenarios.  So this issue does seem specific to the PyDev environment.  I additionally created an entirely fresh Eclipse workspace with only the Python interpreter configured and ran my test again on a freshly created PyDev project using the same source code.  The results were the same.p
