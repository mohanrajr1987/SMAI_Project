Positive 1080 pI would like the user to draw a polygon shape on google maps  this isnt an issue and have this sorted. When the user then clicks a button, I need to work out how many rectangular shapes of a specific size will fit inside this polygon.p  pThe issue I have is if the polygon is for example 6m x 4m and the shape that needs to fit is 2m x 3m, then you can only fit 3 shapes area totalling 6m x 3m if the shapes are side by side and leaves 6m x 1m area remaining.p  pThe remaining area is the same area as the shape, but its the wrong size.p  pHow do I see how many whole shapes fit inside the polygonp  pI will upload an image to show what I mean a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comncaHL.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comncaHL.png altenter image description hereap

Positive 1080 pBasically I am creating an algorithm that plays the game of Snake independently.  I have managed to make it work out which direction to head to within the square of the game, but the version of Snake that I made has toroidal space, namely that when the snakes head goes off one side of the square, it reappears on the opposite side. p  pOn that basis, it is not important for me to calculate what the emdistanceem between two points namely the snakes head and the food block, but rather what emdirectionem the food is in relation to the head.p  pI.e. on a grid of 50 pixels square, when the head is at [row 49, column 49] and the food is at [1,1], I dont want the snake to have to travel 48 squares up and to the left. Id rather it just travel 2 squares down and 2 right. p  pWhat formula would I then use to calculate which direction will result in the shortest travel time between the head and the foodp  pPS please let me know if I should post this in another Stack Exchange site and I will do so. p

But havent gotten so far that starting over with another language would be a bad idea. p  pstrongIve read here that learning C, before starting iPhone development and ObjectiveC programming, is a good idea.strong But at the same time strongIve read that starting out with C will later make it tougher to programlearn C making you code c as C.strong p  pstrongIve also contemplated starting out with C from the get go, but Im not sure that will enable me to program for iPhone to the same extend that learning C willstrong  I know that the Android NDK is in C, so thats a plus. But strongI dont really know what kind of stuff you can develop with the NDKstrong Perhaps starting out with C would make me a better C programmer, than going through C first which could be a plus if I ever want to do stuff outside of ObjectiveC for non mobile projects. p  pI could just continue with my Java learning and code for Android, but it seems theres just more support for the iPhone plus their interface builder is much better than the android version. just from reading on the net Wouldnt it be easier to go from CCObjectiveC to Java than the other way around p  pAnyway, Im rambling.  The books I have on my shelf are Accelerated C The C programming Language the white book An introduction to programming and object oriented design using Java Version 5.0  Any thoughts are appreciated. p  p[edit added some specific questions] 1. Is it a problem learning C before C for a new programmer 2. Is it equally good to learn C before objectiveC as it is to learn C before. 3. Is the documentation for ObjectiveC big enough to learn it as a first language without any prior C knowledge 4. If I want to code for both iPhone and android will learning one before the other be betterp
