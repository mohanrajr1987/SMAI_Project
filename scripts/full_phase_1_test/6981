Positive 6981 pI looked through some similar question but couldnt find an example of this sort of logic what im looking for is a way to parse through a large return of usernames in powershell. User names that are not service accounts or kiosks have a specific naming convention of 6 grouped numeric characters for example username123456. I was thinking there has to be a way of using the whereobject command but cant find anything on the syntax on technet or other PS resources. The one liner to get a return from the local domain isp  precodeSearchADAccount PasswordNeverExpires   SelectObject Name, Enabled codepre  pThis returns a list of domain accounts that have the password set to never expire. I want to only see the ones with the above naming convention  I know you can achieve this with regex but my regex is quite rustyif it can be done with whereobject that would be optimal. I also looked into using pattern, but it seems to be for more complex returns than this... Thanksp

Negative 6981 pIve got a text field inside of a codeUICollectionViewCellcode that can receive firstresponder status. The cell currently isnt visible onscreen, and I want to scroll to the cell based off of a button hit from a codeUISegmentedControlcode. Theres two segments to this control and a hit to the second segment should scroll to the first cell in the 2nd section of the codeUICollectionViewcode. After this happens, the cell should get selected programatically, and then the text field inside of that cell is supposed to get first responder status and bring up the keyboard.p  pWhats happening now inside my action method from a value change from the segmented control is that a call to code[UICollectionView selectItemAtIndexPathanimatedscrollPosition]code isnt scrolling to it at all and Im using codeUICollectionViewScrollPositionTopcode may as well be codeNonecode.

I have search around for a code, that jumps to the specific anchor point, when clicking an item in the menu. Also good to known is that I have a fixed header.p  pI came up with this codep  precodedocument.readyfunction   An offset to push the content down from the top var offset  header.outerHeight  function scrollToAnchor anchor       html, body.animate scrollTop anchor.position  offset     When you click on an ltagt that has a  navprimarynavwrapper a[href], sitemap a[href], .hireme a[href].bindclick.smoothscroll,function event       Prevent from default action to intitiate      The id of the section we want to go to.     var id  this.attrhref       Our scroll target  the top position of the      section that has the id referenced by our href.     var target  id.offset.top  offset      console.logtarget       The magic...smooth scrollin goodness.     html, body.animate scrollToptarget , 500       Prevent the page from jumping down to our section.     event.preventDefault     return false        This part handles the highlighting functionality.   We use the scroll functionality again, some array creation and    manipulation, class adding and class removing, and conditional testing   var aChildren  primarynavwrapper li.children  find the a children of the list items var aArray  []  create the empty aArray for var i0 i lt aChildren.length i          var aChild  aChildren[i]     var ahref  aChild.attrhref     aArray.pushahref   this for loop fills the aArray with attribute href values  window.scrollfunction     var windowPos  window.scrollTop  get the offset of the window from the top of page     var windowHeight  window.height  get the height of the window     var docHeight  document.height      for var i0 i lt aArray.length i          var theID  aArray[i]         var divPos  theID.offset.top  offset  get the offset of the div from the top of page         var divHeight  theID.height  get the height of the div in question         if windowPos gt divPos ampamp windowPos lt divPos  divHeight              a[href  theID  ].addClasscurrent          else              a[href  theID  ].removeClasscurrent                 now scroll to the anchor when loading page  this was missing scrollToAnchordocument.location.hash  codepre  pBut I have some trouble with this code. First off, I think this code can much be shorter than now, is that correct Second when I am on a landingspage of the website not the homepage and I want to go back, the smooth scroll doesnt work. I thought this was the part that was missingp  precodescrollToAnchordocument.location.hash codepre  pAnd third, I get this error in my developer tool p  precodeUncaught TypeError Cannot read property top of undefined codepre  pa hrefhttpjsfiddle.netE773g5 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netE773g5ap  pHope someone can help me out Thanks in advance.
