They believed that it was because of his blessings that they were able to withstand a long siege on the island and emerge victorious.ltparagtThe Colossus was built with bronze, reinforced with iron, and weighted with stones.  While it is often depicted straddling Mandrkion harbor, this is now considered technically impossible and therefore, it likely stood beside the harbor.ltparagtThe statue was toppled by an earthquake in 226 BC.  It snapped at the knees and fell over on to the land.  The Oracle of Delphi suggested that it fell because the people of Rhodes had offended Helios, and they decided not to rebuild it.ltparagtThe statue remained on the ground until 654 AD., and even broken, it was so impressive that many traveled to see it.   ltstorygt     lthistorygt     ltmainimage filecolossus.jpg w528 h349gt     ltsource sectionid101 newspaperid21gt ltwondergt ltwondergt     ltname languageEnglishgtGreat Pyramid of Gizaltnamegt     ltlocationgtGiza, Egyptltlocationgt     ltheight unitsfeetgt455ltheightgt     lthistorygt         ltyearbuilt eraBCgt2570ltyearbuiltgt         ltstorygt     It is believed to have taken 20 years and as many as 100,000 workers to complete the Great Pyramid, which was built as a tomb for the 4th dynasty Egyptian pharaoh named Khufu.  It was built as part of a complex that included temples and many other pyramids.ltparagtThe outermost stones of the pyramid were highly polished white limestone, which were eventually loosened by an earthquake more than 600 years ago, and were removed to help build cities and mosques.  When these casing stones were present, some believe that the pyramid was so large and bright that it could be seen from the moon.ltparagtThere is much speculation about the construction methodologies and intentions of the pyramid, including references to the moon, the Orion constellation, continental gravity, and more.  What is known, however, is that the four sides of the base are more than 700 feet long, and differ in length by no more than 8 inches.  Each side of the pyramid is almost perfectly aligned with the four cardinal points of the compass.  And, the pyramids dimensions covert to a ratio that equates to 2 with nearly perfect accuracy.   ltstorygt     lthistorygt     ltmainimage filepyramid.jpg w528 h349gt     ltsource sectionid123 newspaperid71gt     ltsource sectionid21 newspaperid42gt ltwondergt ltwondergt     ltname languageEnglishgtHanging Gardens of Babylonltnamegt     ltlocationgtAl Hillah, Iraqltlocationgt     ltheight unitsfeetgt0ltheightgt     lthistorygt         ltyearbuilt eraBCgt600ltyearbuiltgt         ltyeardestroyed eraBCgt226ltyeardestroyedgt         lthowdestroyedgtearthquakelthowdestroyedgt         ltstorygt     The first and most interesting fact about the gardens is that there is significant controversy about whether the gardens existed at all.ltparagtWhether they did or did not exist, there are many elaborate accounts and poetic descriptions of the gardens.  They are generally believed to have been built by King Nebuchadrezzar II for his wife because she missed the gardens of her home.  Some research suggests that it was an elaborate series of rooftop gardens.  Another theory suggests that the gardens were built in the walls of the royal palace.ltparagtBabylon, being in the middle of the desert, had no such natural greenery, however calling into question of how such lushness would have survived in the dryness of the desert.  Recent excavations have suggested the use of an exceptional system of irrigation using a cellar well in conjunction with a chain pump to raise the water to the gardens.  Still, other theories even suggest that the gardens werent in Babylon at all.  Rather, that they were constructed by Sennacherib at the eastern bank of the Tigris river.ltparagtRegardless of the final outcome, it is interesting to note that the imagination of the poets and ancient historians have created one of the Wonders of the World.   ltstorygt     lthistorygt     ltmainimage filegardens.jpg w528 h349gt     ltsource sectionid11 newspaperid24gt     ltsource sectionid18 newspaperid151gt ltwondergt ltwondergt     ltname languageEnglishgtStatue of Zeus at Olympialtnamegt     ltname languageGreekgt ltnamegt     ltlocationgtOlympia, Greeceltlocationgt     ltheight unitsfeetgt39ltheightgt     lthistorygt         ltyearbuilt eraBCgt430ltyearbuiltgt         ltyeardestroyed eraADgt426ltyeardestroyedgt         lthowdestroyedgtfirelthowdestroyedgt         ltstorygtCarved from ivory, on a throne of cedarwood, the statue was created by the Greek sculptor Phidias around 430 BC.  In its right hand was a lifesize statue of Nike, the goddess of victory, and in its left was a large sceptre topped with an eagle.  The statue, nearly 40 feet tall, was said to fill the entire width of the one of the aisles of the Temple of Zeus, and its head nearly scraped the temples ceiling.ltparagtIn 426 AD, the temple was destroyed and many historians believe that the statue was destroyed at that time. Others believe, however, that the statue was moved to Constantinople now Istanbul and was destroyed about 50 years later.ltparagtAlthough many copies of the statue were made during its 800 year lifespan, none are known to have survived.ltstorygt     lthistorygt     ltmainimage filezeus.jpg w528 h349gt ltwondergt ltwondergt     ltname languageEnglishgtTemple of Artemis at Ephesusltnamegt     ltname languageGreekgtltnamegt     ltlocationgtEphesus, Turkeyltlocationgt     ltheight unitsfeetgt60ltheightgt     lthistorygt         ltyearbuilt eraBCgt550ltyearbuiltgt         ltyeardestroyed eraBCgt356ltyeardestroyedgt         lthowdestroyedgtfirelthowdestroyedgt         ltstorygtThe Temple of Artemis at Ephesus was built and rebuilt over the course of many years.  The most famous was built in about 550 BC and was funded by King Croesus of Lydia.ltparagtUnlike many other temples of its time, it was built of marble and glittered with gold.  The temples foundation was over 180 by 350 feet and its steps led to a high platform on which stood more than one hundred beautifully sculptured columns that supported its roof.  At least twice the size of the Parthenon, it was so breathtaking it was said to rise to the clouds.ltparagtThe temple housed many incredible works of art, but the most famous was the statue of Artemis herself.  Although the original no longer exists, it was thought to have been made of gold and other beautiful materials.  Her legs were covered with animals and bees and the top of the body covered with breasts symbolizing fertility.ltparagtAlthough destroyed and rebuilt many times, and ultimately left to be destroyed by man, nature and neglect, the most famous version of the temple was destroyed by arson committed by a man named Herostratus on the night Alexander the Great was born.ltstorygt     lthistorygt     ltmainimage fileartemis.jpg w528 h349gt     ltsource sectionid92 newspaperid19gt ltwondergt ltwondergt     ltname languageEnglishgtMausoleum at Halicarnassusltnamegt     ltname languageGreekgt ltnamegt     ltlocationgtBodrum, Turkeyltlocationgt     ltheight unitsfeetgt135ltheightgt     lthistorygt         ltyearbuilt eraBCgt352ltyearbuiltgt         ltyeardestroyed eraADgt1404ltyeardestroyedgt         lthowdestroyedgtearthquakelthowdestroyedgt         ltstorygtThe monument was built as a tomb for Mausolus, a governor in the Persian Empire. Sparing no expense, his widowed wife Artemisia who was also his sister as was considered customary commissioned wellknown Greek architects and artists to design the tomb and sculptural reliefs for each of the four sides of the building.ltparagtThe monument was almost square, nearly 14 stories tall, and its base was more than 10,000 square feet. Each side of the tomb had nine massive columns, and the top was a stepped pyramid on which stood by a fourhorse marble chariot in which there were images of Mausolus and Artemisia.ltparagtThe monument stood for nearly 17 centuries and was eventually destroyed by a series of earthquakes. And, like the Lighthouse of Alexandria, the tomb was so famous that Mausoluss name has become the root word for large tombs in many languages for example, mausoleo in Spanish.ltstorygt     lthistorygt     ltmainimage filemausoleum.jpg w528 h349gt     ltsource sectionid141 newspaperid21gt     ltsource sectionid2 newspaperid19gt ltwondergt ltwondergt     ltname languageEnglishgtLighthouse of Alexandrialtnamegt     ltname languageGreekgt   ltnamegt     ltlocationgtAlexandria, Egyptltlocationgt     ltheight unitsfeetgt384ltheightgt     lthistorygt         ltyearbuilt eraBCgt280ltyearbuiltgt         ltyeardestroyed eraADgt1323ltyeardestroyedgt         lthowdestroyedgtearthquakelthowdestroyedgt         ltstorygt     Located on the island of Pharos in the harbor of Alexandria, the lighthouse may be the most famous lighthouse in history.  The lighthouse was very different than modern lighthouses in that it was built in three stages, all sloping inward.  Built of marble blocks with lead mortar the lowest was square, the next octagonal, and the top cylindrical.  Within the lighthouse was a ramp and dumbwaiter that allowed wood to be transported to the fire that burned at night.ltparagtInside the open top of the lighthouse was a large curved mirror that was used to reflect the sunlight during the day and the fire at night.  It is said that mariners could see the light up to 35 miles away.  Legends have it that the light was so bright it could be used to burn enemy ships.ltparagtThere are many stories about its ultimate demise, however, the most likely cause is believed to be as many as 22 earthquakes between 320 AD and 1323 AD which led to its decommission.ltparagtThe Lighthouse of Alexandria was so famous in ancient times that the island on which it stood, Pharos, became the root word for lighthouse in many languages for example, phare in French.   ltstorygt     lthistorygt     ltmainimage filelighthouse.jpg w528 h349gt     ltsource sectionid112 newspaperid53gt ltwondergt ltancientwondersgt codepre  pHere is the XSLTp  precodeltxml version1.0gt ltxslstylesheet xmlnsxslhttpwww.w3.org1999XSLTransform version1.0gt ltxsloutput methodhtmlgt  lt  XML2e  gt lt to follow the books example, see this and the sections below gt ltxsltemplate matchgt  lthtmlgt   ltheadgt     lttitlegtWonders of the Worldlttitlegt   ltheadgt   ltbodygt     lth1gtSeven Wonders of the Ancient Worldlth1gt      lth2gtOverviewlth2gt     lttable border1gt       lttrgt         ltthgtWonder Nameltthgt         ltthgtLocationltthgt         ltthgtHeightltthgt       lttrgt        lt  XML2e  gt       lt to follow the books example, see this and the sections below gt       ltxslapplytemplates selectancientwonderswonder[positionlast]gt         ltxslsort selectheight orderdescending datatypenumber gt       ltxslapplytemplatesgt     lttablegt     lth2gtHistorylth2gt     ltxslapplytemplates selectancientwonderswonderhistorygt       ltxslsort selectyearbuilt orderdescending datatypenumber gt ltxslapplytemplatesgt   ltbodygt lthtmlgt ltxsltemplategt  lt  XML2e  gt lt to follow the books example, see this and the sections below gt ltxsltemplate matchwondergt lttrgt   lttdgt     ltagt       ltxslattribute namehrefgt         ltxslvalueof selectname[languageEnglish]gt       ltxslattributegt       ltstronggt         ltxslvalueof selectname[languageEnglish]gt       ltstronggt     ltagt     ltbrgt      lt  XML2e  gt     lt to follow the books example, see this and the sections below gt     ltxslapplytemplates selectname[languageEnglish]gt   lttdgt   lttdgt     ltxslvalueof selectlocationgt   lttdgt   lttdgt     ltxslchoosegt       ltxslwhen testheight  0gt         ltxslvalueof selectheightgt       ltxslwhengt       ltxslotherwisegt         unknown       ltxslotherwisegt     ltxslchoosegt   lttdgt lttrgt ltxsltemplategt  lt  XML2e  gt lt to follow the books example, see this section below gt ltxsltemplate matchname[languageEnglish]gt ltemgt   ltxslvalueof select.gt ltemgt ltxsltemplategt ltxsltemplate matchhistorygt ltagt       ltxslattribute namenamegt         ltxslvalueof select..name[languageEnglish] gt       ltxslattributegt      ltagt ltimagegt   ltxslattribute namesrcgt     ltxslvalueof selectwondermainimagefilegt The ltxslvalueof select..name[languageEnglish]gt ltxslapplytemplates select..name[languageEnglish]gt was built in ltxslvalueof selectyearbuiltgt ltxsltextgt         ltxsltextgtltxslvalueof selectyearbuilteragt   ltxslattributegt ltimagegt ltxslchoosegt   ltxslwhen testyeardestroyed 0gt     and was destroyed by ltxslvalueof selecthowdestroyedgt     in ltxslvalueof selectyeardestroyedgt ltxsltextgtltxsltextgt     ltxslvalueof selectyeardestroyederagt   ltxslwhengt   ltxslotherwisegt     and is still standing today.   ltxslotherwisegt ltxslchoosegt ltbr gtltbr gt ltxsltemplategt ltxslstylesheetgt codepre

Negative 272 pI have the following code in a Windows C form that parses a textbox string. The typical string would look something like p  pz5 100c x87.50. p  pAnother example might bep  pm5 100c vs z5 100c. p  pIn both examples, I have various attributes that are important, z5, 100, c, x, 87.50. From this string I am feeding it into various functions these functions are less important.  p  pI found various samples and have the below code, but when I run the code it will only parse the first found expression and not iterate through and display all found expressions. For example, z5 100c x87.50 returns 5 and c. p  pThe the relevant information from the string m5 100c vs z5 100c. m this is a month symbol. 5 is a year. 100 is a price. c is a structure. vs is a pricing function or what calls a difference function. z is a month symbol. 5 is a year. 100 is a separate price. c is a separate structure.  p  pIs there a better method for reading the entire string, then parsing and extracting the relevant informationp  precodeprivate void toolStripButton2Clickobject sender, EventArgs e      string contract  toolStripTextBox1.ToString     string contractConvert  contract.ToLower      Regex re  new Regexc.p.s.f.cs.ps.vs.x.
