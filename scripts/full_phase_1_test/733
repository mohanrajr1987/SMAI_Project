Positive 733 pI am building within Visual Studio 2012 using thisp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comhBW6s.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comhBW6s.png altenter image description hereap  pUnless I do a manual check in of the entire solution, it does not seem to build with the latest changes. p  pstrongIn order to build with the latest source, is it a requirement to check the code into TFSstrongp
Positive 733 pRecently I inherited a project, source controlled on TFS. Lets say it had classes A.cs, B.cs and C.cs. I developed some new features  changed class C.cs and added classes D.cs and E.cs. I checked them in.p  pThen the project manager realized, that the previous developer made some changes to A.cs and B.cs and we do not want them in the production yet.p  pI backed up the project localy, deleted my local copy of the project, got older version from TFS get specific version, added new classes D.cs and E.cs and changed C.cs.p  pEverything worked fine. There was no problem. But after I checkedin the solution, I cannot build, because suddenly I have the new versions not wanted of A.cs and B.cs. p  pWhat were the right steps to solve this How do I now overwrite A.cs and B.cs on the server with their older versionsp

Positive 733 pI am trying to do a TFSs build in my remote server. Usually I am doing my template.xml with visual studio, dragging and dropping some kind of box. p  pIf I am not wrong I should to declare a variable named ScriptDetails, that is cointained in a box called RunDeploymentScript. However there are some errorsp  p1 ScriptDetails need always an argument or something, I get this kind of error p  pValue for a required activity argument ScriptDetais was not supplied. Parameter name rootArgumentValuesp  pI tried to set in the constructor my script path inside my solution project, but then I get other error, Too many argument in ScriptDetails constructor.p  p2 I had been read the whole internet but I didnt find any information, tutorial or example about how to do this, so please, dont copypaste links here that you googled it, because for sure Ive read all of them.p  pWhen I add these box in my build configuration I can see some options that do a reference to my variables declared in my template.xml but ScriptDetails is disabled to work with this configuration.p  pI have no idea about what more to do, I just need to build a project and launch 2 scripts in powerwhell language.p  pThank you and greetings.p
Positive 733 pIm using TFS 2013 Update 3 and Release Management 2013 with Update 3 agentbased templates.p  pIn the Release Management client, Id find very useful the ability to add a comment for any actioncomponent or even a group of them that is part of a deployment sequence. This is because often its obvious what an actioncomponent does e.g. Move File or Folder, but it might be useful to know why that is done, also in the context of that particular deployment sequence.p  pI havent found a way to achieve that, is it actually possiblep  pIf not, do you have any alternative solution or do you know if a similar feature is available in newer versionsp
Positive 733 pThe development environment I am using Android Studio does not support TFS. The only tool that is available to me is TFS command line.p  pWhen I modify a source file from within Android Studio, it removes the readonly attribute on the file and saves it. Eventually I end up with a directory that contains a files that have been modified and b newer files.p  pI am trying to understand how to identify these modifiednewer files.p  pCommands codetf folderdiff . rcode shows me newerchanged files but ignores code.tfignorecode directives. As a result, I end up browsing through 100s of intermediate files.p  pIs there a better way to get the list of newerchanged files that honors the directives in code.tfignorecode file Regards.p

Negative 733 pI have a desktop and I want to install linux on it and use it as a server. I believe I dont need to install a complete linux distro cause I dont need the user interface, I can command the server using ssh in another computer and tell my web server to install apache, mysql...p  pI want my webserver not to consume CPU with GUI or mouse or keyboard... I want my linux distro to only usage the resources needed to run the webserver.p  pBefore you ask why I want to do this I will explain myself I am using AWS for some time and its amazing how they provide a cloud where I install a linux image and I can control it using SSH from my home Their server is probably not running any interface, probably there is not even a screen there. Its just a CPU running my web server and listening to SSH to do as I say. There is no need to consume resources having a linux distro with gui and listening to keyboard and mouse eventsp
