Negative 69665 pIm completing a dissertation in health economics and would like to explore the possibility of using an algorithm to answer a checklist that I manually filled in during my research.p  pThe checklist is a 24item checklist which asks questions such as Was a discount rate reported. Now, the articles Ive been reviewing tend to be very codified. That is, there are only a few ways that they report an answer e.g. we discounted at 3 in this evaluation. p  pTheoretically, I think it would be possible to write a program that could search text and fill out the majority of these checklist items. However, I have very little experience in programming. As far as I can see, a program like this would involve writing an algorithm of sorts, but that is where my knowledge ends.p  pParticularly, I would like to know  Is this possible  If so, how would I go about exploring this further Ideally, Id like to get to a point where I could play around with writing an algorithm to look through my database. p
