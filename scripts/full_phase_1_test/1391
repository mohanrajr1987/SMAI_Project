Positive 1391 pSo Im doing this assignment from an online CMU class where I am writing an instructionlevel MIPS simulator. There are several input files given in asm format, which have to be converted into hexadecimal form in order to be read by the simulator.

Positive 1391 pAlright so I am attempting to get a digital industrial scale to send data to an RS232 wireless device. The RS232 device will then send the data taken from the scale to the website I use at work. I have finally gotten the RS232 set up perfectly to match the details on the scales user manual which can be seen here www.globalindustrial.comsiteimagesuniversalproductextras300625DigitalShippingampReceivingScale.pdf. I know it is set up correctly because the website lists it as a weight value and I am getting data sent from the RS232 to the website. My issue you ask All the data is in hexadecimal. While this would be fine if everyone using the website was an engineer, it makes it a little difficult to read for everybody else. Now, using the RS232 wireless devices user manual which can be found here a hrefhttpww1.microchip.comdownloadsenDeviceDoc50002230A.pdf relnofollowhttpww1.microchip.comdownloadsenDeviceDoc50002230A.pdfa there are tons of options for set opt format except one to change the data to decimal from hex. When the scale is directly connected to the null modem I get no issues the weight data is displayed like you would assume it would. Maybe this is a more difficult task than I think it is, but you would think there would be an option for that right Anyway, I would really appreciate any insight or help anyone has to offer. Thank you.p

Negative 1391 pHere is my setupp  pClient MDB listener running on WebSphere Application Server version 8.5 Server WebSphere MQ Queue Manager version 7.5 running on a different machine.p  pThe listener connects to the queue manager using a JMS queue connection factory configuration.

The WebSphere does a JNDI retrieval of the administered object using its name, and then makes the actual connection.p  pNow I have a requirement to secure the connection using SSL. Further, I have to create a custom SSLSocketFactory object using selfcreated keyStore and trustStore files, and set it in the connection factory object.
