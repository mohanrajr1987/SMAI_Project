But practically, does it mean that I should expect results to be erroneous if I preform operations using numbers less than the resolution How can I quantify the error, for say addition, of two floating point numbers given their precision If the resolution is as large as 1e15, why would the smallest allowable number be on the order of 1e308 p  pThank you in advancep

Positive 305 pI have been looking into a problem whereby I am converting a float to a human readable format, and back. Namely a string.

Positive 305 pI currently am reading in a string that starts with a number up to the next delimeter and testing if the string read in is a float.

When I try I get the error print         p  precode  print ERROR s  m.groups   TypeError not all arguments converted during string formatting codepre  pI feel like I am missing something simple but I cannot figure out what. p  pSo in summary I am trying to use the above regular expression to compare a read in number string to see if it is in the float form.

There is not type promotion here per standard.p  pIve also tested codeclang 3.5code, this compiler seems to cast the result of codef1  f2code back to a normal 64 bits floating point representation this is an implementation defined behavior but for my question I prefer the default gcc behavior.p  pAs per my understanding the comparison will be done in between a type for which we dont know the size ie. codeformat whose range and precision may be greatercode and codeepsiloncode which size is exactly 64 bits.p  pWhat I really find hard to understand is strongequalitystrong comparison with a well known C types eg. 64bits codedoublecode and something codewhose range and precision may be greatercode.

Negative 305 pI had a table Blah  latitude float, longitude float, createtime date, ownerid int , ..... p  pand my code does only a single query p  precodeselect   from Blah  where latitude lt l1 and latitude gt l2    and longitude lt ll1 and longitude gt ll2    and createtime lt t1 and createtime gt t2  and ownerid lt o1 and ownerid gt o2  codepre  pof course the values l1, l2,.... o1,o2 are dynamic params coming from programp  pmy question is what kind of index I should create composite index  in case of composite index, which column should I put first how effective is the indexp  pI thought about this for a long time, and couldnt find detailed docs on how the oracle index works.p  pI can find docs that its implemented using Btree, in our case  each key in the Btree is a 4tuple  column1, column2, column3, column4 where the ordering relation of such tuples are defined to be lexical order.p  pthen for the above query, assuming our order is ownerid, createtime, latitude, longitude, I guess oracle would first need to binary search to the point  o1, t1, l1,ll1,  for this operation, the index is indeed useful. but next,  we need to find the ending point of this first interium  we need to find o1,t1, l1, ll2 , this can be done by binary search too.p  pnext, we need to find the next section that satisfies the condition, so we need to  find o1, t1, lx, ll1  where lx is the next value larger than l1, we could find this by binary search too. but in our case, its very likely  that for the same latitude, there can be no more than 1 longitude,  so here binary search is not more effective than linear scan.  p  pfollowing this spirit, it seems that we should put the column with a small value range cardinality first, in this case, createtime, if our points are created on only a few days. also if we never do range conditions, but only equals  conditions, then it does not matter which column is first, rightp  pto make it clearer, here is a simpler examplep  plets say I have 2 columns, X, and Yp  pin the db, values for both are [1,2,....100], so we have 100x100 rowsp  pmy query isp  precodeselect  from mytable where X gt 34 and X lt 78 and Y gt 12 and Y lt 15 codepre  psay our index is on X, Y, so the comparison rule between 2 values arep  precodev1 lt v2 ltgt  v1.x lt v2.x  v1.x  v2.x ampamp v1.y lt v2.y codepre  pgiven the above ordering rule, we can see that the values in the index are  arranged in serial like  values for x,yp  precode1,1, 1,2 1,3 .... 1,100      2,1  2,2 2,3 ......2,100 ..... 100,1 100,2 ....... 100,100 codepre  pnow , to search for the values in the query, the BTree traversal needs to  locate 78341 intervals, hence 783412 lookup 1 for the beginning  one for the end locations, not just 2 lookups.p  pso if we have higher dimensions, the interval counts increases exponentially with the number of dimensions, so indexing may not be useful anymore  this is my concernp  pthanks a lot Yangp

Negative 305 pI would like to write private comments in Eclipse while working on Java projects. In other words, I would like to write comments associated with areas in the Java classes that only I can see but other developers working on the project cannot. The comments therefore cannot be regular comments in the source code. Ideally I would select an area on a Java source file and have a view in the perspective allowing me to write and read my comments associated with the selected area. Those comments should be persisted in a files outside of the Java source files of the project.p  pI understand that as other developers modify the Java code my comments might become stale and I will have to eventually have to work to alleviate this problem. I am not worried about the persistence right now, either.p  pHow do I handle the Eclipse part of the challenge, i.e. create my own view into which I can writeread comments and have it associated with locations in the source files Or, can I display comments lines in the source files that are not saved along with the source so that they are privatep
