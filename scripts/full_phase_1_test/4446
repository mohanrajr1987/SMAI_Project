Negative 4446 pI ran into a substantial problem with the way Netbeans packages up Java programs into native Mac Apps For those who arent familiar, Netbeans can bundle your Jar file with a JRE so you have a completely selfcontained App. Clients dont even have to have Java on their computers to run it. The whole process is explained well a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions30966007createanativebundleforajavafxapplicationthathasapreloader30983359noredirect1comment5000462330983359herea. p  pThe problem I found was that the apps Netbeans produces completely ignore JavaFX Preloaders. I think its because of the slimmed down JRE that gets added in. I couldnt find any solutions online and wanted to post one here for anyone who runs into the same issue.p

Negative 4446 pI would like to arrange UIControls in WPF in a similar way to the applications on the iPhone. They should be positioned on a grid, but a user should be able to drag them somewhere else, after releasing the mouse button or the finger in case of an iPhone the selected UIControl should snap back to the next position in the grid. The other UIElements should be rearranged automatically.p  pFurther the user should also be connect two elements with a line or something.p  pIm not experienced with WPF. The first question is if there is a container which is suitable for something System.Windows.Controls.Grid  or if I have to extend canvas or somethig else for this.p  pI would like to know which elements from the WPF framework can be used and which elements I have to write myself.p  pFor people who do not own an iPhone a hrefhttpwww.youtube.comwatchv3omhu2AUWC8 relnofollowhttpwww.youtube.comwatchv3omhu2AUWC8ap  pUpdatep  pIve looked at AnimatedTilePanel in the BangOTricks examples see below, this one explains how to create your own Panel and how to let it arrange things there.. However I still need an idea how to implement drag and drop correctly in this example..p
