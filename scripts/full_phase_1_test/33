Positive 33 pDo there exist regular expression engines for sequences other than strings It occurs to me that there is nothing special about strings that restricts regex to them, they are just sequences of characters.p  pFor example, if I had list of codeBuffalocode objects, and I wanted to check if my list matched between 4 and 7 codeBuffalocode over 5 ft tall, followed by a white codeBuffalocode, followed by a backreference to the 47 codeBuffalocode before, and then the end of the list, are there engines to support something like thisp  pI dont currently have a need for this, just curious. p

Starting   from his hotel, located in the northwest corner of city, he intends   to take a walk to the southeast corner of the city and then walk   back. When walking to the southeast corner, he will only walk east or   south, and when walking back to the northwest corner, he will only   walk north or west.

Therefore he has   kindly asked you to write a program to solve his problem.p      pGiven the city map a 2D grid where the interesting locations and   blocked areas are marked, determine the maximum number of interesting   locations he can visit.

Positive 33 pI have inherited a codebase which contains code such as the following note example code is PHPp    pre classlangphp prettyprintoverridecodetry       Do something which doesnt intentionally throw exceptions.  catch Exception e      thisgtloggtlogegtgetMessage     thisgtproductgtsetErroregtgetMessage     return false  codepre  pSo essentially, the code is catching the exception. Logging it, and the failing silently apart from the log message.p  pThis behaviour seems to make sense in production, but makes development much more difficult as stack traces have to be looked up in log files, rather than being printed to the console. So I have come up with the following functionp  pre classlangphp prettyprintoverridecodeprivate function tryCatch func        Bind closure, so that this allows it to access class properties     if isobjectfunc ampamp func instanceof Closure          Closurebindfunc, this, static           if Appenvironmenttest          return func      else          try              return func          catch Exception e              thisgtloggtlogegtgetMessage             thisgtproductgtsetErroregtgetMessage              return false                 codepre  pwhich can then be used like sop  pre classlangphp prettyprintoverridecodethisgttryCatchfunction        Do something  codepre  pThis code specialcases the test environment which it calls the passed in function without exception handling so any exceptions remain unhandled.

Negative 33 pI am using Angular Xeditable for inplace table editing.  I have a field in my object model that is stored in bits per second.  I dont want the user to have to type this value in bits per second, because its always going to be a multiple of 1000.  Therefore when the user edits the data, I want the data in the editor to automatically be presented in Kbps, and then when the user types in their Kbps value, convert back to bps to store in the editor.  p  pExample ngmodel is defined as audio.bitrate. The value 96000 is currently stored in that field.  When the user clicks Edit, I want that text editor to only display 96.  When the user types in another value, such as 128, I want that to be stored in audio.bitrate as 128000.  Is this possible with Angular Xeditablep

Negative 33 pI want to create a structure of hashes within hashes in Perl, but all tutorials like chapter 9.4. emHashes of Hashesem in a hrefhttporeilly.comcatalog9780596004927 relnofollowProgramming Perla add them all upfront.

Negative 33 pIm trying to find out how to integrate the Google calendar using the v3 API with an existing application for a local nonprofit organization.p  pThe intent is the following our organisation has a general public Google calendar with Google account that both visitors and active volunteers can subscribe to or show in their own calendar. We are in the process of developing a simple management web application written in PHP in which task forces can be created and managed. The core functionality is planning meetings and managing the notes of these meetings, but this is not relevant to the question.. Users are notified via email when a meeting is planned. It would also be very nice if the planned meetings could be programmatically added to the Google calendar. I now have to do this manually for every planned meeting.p  pIve been reading the documentation over at a hrefhttpdevelopers.google.com relnofollowdevelopers.google.coma and the Google Code page for the php library for two days now and I find myself lost in different authentication schemes, account types, keys and many more, to the point where Im starting to think that this is not an intended use case.p  pTo come to the core of my question I need to access the organisations Google calendar, and be able to post events, without any human interaction. Is this even possible If so, Which account do i need to create web app, service account or installed app in the Google APIs console How would I authenticate the application Do I need to grant rights to the application somehow Is there an example somewhere I can refer to possibly with a different APIp  pFrom what Ive seen, the critical difference with all examples in Googles documentation, is that I do not want to modify a current or endusers calendar, but the same calendar, regardless of the logged in user. user authentication does not happen with the Google api, we rolled our own. The redirectuser consent mechanism isnt exactly useful for me.p  pIn a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions11289050integratemywebsitewithgooglecalendar1130357611303576thisa question, the asker is trying to achieve something similar. The full answer is not provided however. I cant seem to find some of the sources referred to in the accepted response.p
