So I thought of creating Frames with a codeconstcode reference member codecontextcodep  precodeclass Frame    const Gifamp context     Make a frame object   Frameconst Gifamp context contextcontext...     Explicit default copyconstructor, for clarity. Breaks horribly    when called from Gifs copy constructor, since the new Frame will    reference the wrong context, which might be deleted.   Frameconstamp Frame other  default     void draw      draws self considering contexts other frames     codepre  pThis compiles but breaks horribly when copying codeGifcodes. The codeFramecode objects of the new codeGifcode are copies alright, but they reference the wrong context, which has typically been deleted already.p  pI take it that const reference members are probably a bad idea for objects that you intend to copy... Should I use a pointer and explicitly reset it for the new codeFramecodes in the body of a custom codeGifcodes copy constructor p  pIf so, what kind of pointer rawsmart Isnt there a good C11 technique for making this happen automaticallyp  pOr should I be breaking the cyclic dependency and howp  pEDIT thanks to KillianDS To be clear, you start from gif1 with some frames frame11, frame12, ... that point to gif1 and now you want to copy gif1 to gif2 with copied frames frame21, frame22,... but that point to gif2p
