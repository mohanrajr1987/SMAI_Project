Negative 1289 pI need to use an already allocated char buffer with the string content in a stdstring object. After some research I found that this is almost impossible and stdstring would have its own private copy of data always. The only remaining way I can think of to do this is to use a custom allocator that will return the address of the already allocated char buffer. For this to work, stdstring should only use the allocator to allocate memory to hold its string data and for nothing else. Is this the case p
