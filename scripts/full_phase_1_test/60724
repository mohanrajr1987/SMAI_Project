Positive 60724 pI have a webapp running in Tomcat7 which integrates with a 3rd party REST API with an oauth authentication.  The problem I am having is intermittent and seems to happen after the application has ran about a week or more.p  pWhen trying to request a token from the 3rd party API, I get the following response  Caused by strongjavax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException Host name login.blah.com does not match the certificate subject provided by the peer CN.blacked.com, OUDomain Control Validated.strongp  pThe thing is, if I do a curl from this same machine, it responds correctly and if I restart Tomcat, the error goes away.  I am using Spring and making the call using the RestTemplate class.p  pOriginally I used the default implementation of RestTemplate and was receiving a pretty generic SocketTimeout exception.  I then switched i to use Apache HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory so I could make sure my HttpClient was closing and not leaving behind stale connections since the issue only occurs after its been running awhile.  Since switching to HttpClient 4.5, Ive been getting the certificate issue.p  pI also have the webapp running in a test environment, hitting the same URL and working fine while the app in production is throwing the exception. Restarting tomcat fixes the issue.  The name in the exception message CN.blacked.com is not the domain I am attempting to hit and appears to be the domain of an adult website.p  pNow, every HTTP call I make to the 3rd party API, I create a new RestTemplate with a HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory, make my request, close the HttpClient and destroy the connection factory.p  pIm not really sure what could be causing this and cant really reproduce the error on demand since its a very intermittent problem.  Does anyone have any ideasp
Positive 60724 pIm using Intellijidea ultimate 14 and Im experiencing a tiny bit of oddness. When I run over intellij Im seeing everything I would hopeexpect to see in my application. But when I build a war file and deploy to my standalone tomcat Im seeing very slight differences. Specifically right now Im trying to track down why fonts are deploying correctly in the tomcat bundled with Intellij, but not in my standalone. Both are localhost, by the way. Can anybody tell me where on the filesystem intellij stores its tomcat configuration server.xml Id really like to compare the two versions and see if there is anything obviously different.p  pMany thanks,p  pAndyp

Negative 60724 pWe are developing an application which has a web version and a desktop version. Both of them consume a WebAPI which is secured by Identity Server 2.0 as STS and ADFS 2.0 as IP via WSFederation. p  pThe web version is a Single Page Application. When the user login, it redirects to Identity Server HRD. The user chooses ADFS login and then is redirected to ADFS login page. After the user logged in, Identity Server will release a JWT token to the application. Then the application can talk to the WebAPI with the token. p  pNow, we want to develop something in the desktop application to achieve the same login process. I see Azure AD provides a HRD API to desktop application via Windows Azure Authentication Library AAL. Does Identity Server has something similar p
