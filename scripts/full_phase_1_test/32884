Positive 32884 pAll of my questions are in context of Chrome Web Push Notifications, as released in Chrome Version 42.p  p1 GCM API returns Success for even those Registration IDs which are no longer valid. When a person right clicks on the notification, and clicks on Disable notifications from xyz.com, the person can no longer receive notifications. However, when i send the same RegistrationID to GCM API, it still returns success for that particular registration. When i resubscribe again, i get a new RegistrationID. Therefore, I suspect that the previous one gets disabled. Is this intended behaviour Is there any way for us to know if people have unsubscribed by right clicking on the notification and mark them as inactive in our database, in case, the user never comes back again.p  p2 GCM Documentation for ErrorNotRegistered says The client app isnt configured to receive push messages or the app was uninstalled from the device. Can you please explain what does The client app isnt configured to receive push messages meanp

Negative 32884 pIm writing some code using PacketDotNet and SharpPCap to parse H.225 packets for a VOIP phone system. Ive been using Wireshark to look at the structure, but Im stuck. Ive been using a hrefhttpwww.ethereal.comlistsetherealusers200311msg00001.html relnofollowThisa as a reference.p  pMost of the H.225 packets I see are user information type with an empty message body and the actual information apparently shows up as a list of NonStandardControls in Wireshark. I thought Id just extract  out these controls and parse them later, but I dont really know where they start.p  pIn almost all cases, the items start at the 10th byte of the H.225 data. Each item appears to begin with the length which is recorded as 2 bytes. However, I am getting a packet that has items starting at the 11th byte.p  pThe only difference I see in this packet is something in the message body supposedly called open type length which has a value of 1, whereas the rest all appear to be 0. Would the items start at 10  open type length Is there some document that explains what this open type length is forp  pThanks.p
