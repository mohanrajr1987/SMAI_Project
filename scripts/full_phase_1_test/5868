Positive 5868 pIm trying to get a full picture of views refernces in my DB. In other words, I want to know for each field in each view  where it is getting its data from.p  pI know I can get the objects referenced by a view using  codeFROM sys.dmsqlreferencedentities [object name], OBJECTcode.p  pIs there a way to find which field in the referencing object referenced which field in the referenced objectp
Positive 5868 pIm wondering whether there is a way to find out the space available for Views within a layout.p  pTo be a little more precise in the activity two TextViews are displayed side by side. As the second one contains pretty much text, Id like to check, whether this text can be displayed on the screen or whether its too large. If thats the case Ill display a smaller version of the text instead as Android doesnt display this text on multiple lines by default. Currently Im using some code like thisp  precodeWindowManager windowManager  WindowManager getSystemServiceWINDOWSERVICE Display display  windowManager.getDefaultDisplay Point screenSize  new Point display.getSizescreenSize int screenWidth  screenSize.x  if tvTitle.getWidth  tvDescription.getWidth gt screenWidth      tvDescrition.setTextgetStringR.string.descritptionshort  codepre  pBut this doesnt work the widths normally are smaller than the screen, so the long version is used. But the text isnt displayed completely, the last words are always missing.p  pI guess the problem is, that the layout is using a padding and is therefore reducing the space really available.p  pSo how to fix this Any ideas are extremely welcome p

Positive 5868 pThe question might seem too vague but I could not think of a better way to describe the idea, so Ill try to explain it in details.p  pI have MasterController attached to codelthtmlgtcode tag of my SPA application. This MasterController contains all the logic and models for controlling the following UI elementsp  ul lipage title codelttitlegtcode tagli lisubheader which displays the title of current page like Customers, Orders, Settings etc.li liname of the currently loggedin userli lisome commonly used action buttons which will be used for all pages in the system. To be specific, these buttons are codeShow filterscode, codeExport data to Excelcode and codeAdd new recordcode.li ul  pWhile the first two items on this list can be managed through detection of current uirouter state through its codestateChangeSuccesscode event, the last two username and buttons are somewhat problematic, especially the buttons.p  pI can manage the button actions using codebroadcastcode, so every controller can be notified about clicks on any button. But the tricky part here is that the buttons might be needed in different combinations  one page might need all of them, and another one might need none. p  pLets say, uirouter loads some CustomersController. At that point MasterController receives codestateChangeSuccesscode event and by default hides all the buttons. p  pstrongBut now, how does CustomersController tell to MasterController that CustomersController will need two specific buttons from the very beginningstrongp  pTheoretically, I could use codeemitcode from CustomersController to send an event to MasterController, but it somehow feels ugly. Events are meant for, well, events and not for sending requests like hey, MasterController, if you are somewhere up the scope, can you please show the following buttons.p  pOf course, I might be wrong and maybe there is some way to use Angular event system to manage this scenario in clean way.p  pWhat came to my mind is that maybe in the codestateChangeSuccesscode event I could somehow detect if there are currently any listeners for my button click events and then I could hide buttons which do not have any listeners attached, but Im not sure how to do it, and Im not sure whether it will work as expected  whether old listeners will be detached when uirouter recreates the view with another controller.p
