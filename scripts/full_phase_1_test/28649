Positive 28649 pi am trying to get constraints correct so that the font size scales depending on device. it seems that when the vertical size of the UILabel shrinks the scaling does not happen. the scaling only happens when the horizontal size changes. i have tried fixing the aspect ratio as well but then the text does not fit in the screen vertically in that case.p  pi would like all the text to be centered in the gray container and scale according to the width of the container. p  pthis is what i am trying to accomplishp  pimg srchttpi.imgur.com5hzpUj1.png width500p  phere is the xcode file i am trying to modify  a hrefhttpswww.dropbox.comshc1yx8gk2h8d1ycgAACnSXUq2j3EiyCnsMHJIqxBadl0 relnofollowhttpswww.dropbox.comshc1yx8gk2h8d1ycgAACnSXUq2j3EiyCnsMHJIqxBadl0ap

Positive 28649 pI understand that by using codeNSTextAlignment.Naturalcode you allow a label draw its content using the default righting direction for a given language, which helps heaps with localisation, allowing the label to draw its text from lefttoright in languages like englishspanishetc..., and from righttoleft in languages like arabic. Now my question is that I want to have a label draw in the opposite direction to .Natural, so in a lefttoright language the text should align to the right and in righttoleft languages it should align to the left. p  pI cannot find an NSTextAlignment enumeration option for this. so I was hoping somebody would give me some advice on how to accomplish thisp  pMany thanks  p

Negative 28649 pIm writing a small library for reactive programming in an OOstyle, javascript and I am having some problems naming the concepts. The idea is that you have some writeable collectionlike data structures like a sorted set, mutable array, ... From these collections you can get a readonly perspective. When you mutate the collection, events are emitted on the perspective. A perspective has this minimal APIp  ul licodeiterateoffset, callbackcodeli licodelengthcodeli licodesubscribeeventListenercodeli ul  pPerspectives are chainable, so you can create a filter perspective, based on another perspective and given a filter function. The filter perspective will only contain and emit events for values passed from its source perspective that also pass the filter function. There are also perspective classes for map and sort operations.p  pThe idea is very much to split up the mutation and consumption of data, and central to the concept of a perspective is that it is read only.p  pI havent been able to come up with a name for the perspective interface that satisfies me. Up till now I have called it a codeCollectionViewcode analogous to SQL views, and although I think code...Viewcode conveys the readonly part quite well, it creates a lot of confusion with a UI view. Now Im also thinking I should put Reactive in the name, so Im thinking codeReactiveListcode, codeReactiveCollectioncode, but that seems to imply that you can modify it directly. Also it sounds like its a concrete data type, not an interface, and implementors would be called codeMapReactiveListcode, codeSortReactiveListcode, codeFilterReactiveListcode which to me also looks very confusing.p  pAny ideas Thanksp
