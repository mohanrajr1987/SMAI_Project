Positive 5142 pI have an application where I am writing batches of 1000 rows to a SQL Server database using a prepared statement. Now if any of these inserts fails, I want to be able to write the offending line to a log file, so that the data is not completely lost. I would prefer if possible to only write the one line that failed to the log, rather than all 1000 lines, so my question is thisp  pIf one line fails while inserting into the table, say a Primary Key violation occurs, is the whole batch prevented from inserting, or only the one row that failed If the batch fails, is it possible for me to do some sort of loop on the prepared statement, executing each query one by one, and in that way I can figure out the line that failed, and log only that line Or is the only way for me to achieve this to keep a separate array of each insert statement, and loop through that if the batch happens to failp  pSome more detailsp  blockquote   pDatabase Type SQL Server 2008br   Connection Library java.sqlbr   SQL Statement p blockquote  precodeInsert into TableColumn1,Column2 Values Value1, Value2   codepre  pJava Code  p  precodePreparedStatement prpStmt  dbConnection.prepareStatementinsertQuery.toString   for List lst  listOfValues     prpStmt.setString1,lst[0]       prpStmt.setString2,lst[1]       prpStmt.addBatch       dbCount       if dbCount  DBCOUNTLIMIT           try              prpStmt.executeBatch             dbConnection.commit               dbCount  0               prpStmt.clearBatch          catch Exception e             for PreparedStatement ps  prpStmt.getBatches             if logToDBIndividually                 logToFile                               codepre
