Positive 8596 pClicking on tree nodes generates a scroll bar by default as the length of tree panel increases. With each click, a tree node is expanded expected behavior but the scroll bar jumps back to top instead of retaining its position there.p  pLets say the tree panel is expanded fully and a last node is clicked. Clicking on it expands its nodes but the scroll bar jumps up back to top instead, it should have been there and should show the data of the last node.p
