Negative 608 pIm sifting through preexisting code from a new job I just started, and one of the first bugs Im being confronted with is a search bar attached to a codeUITableViewcode subclass, which is dismissing the keyboard after every keystroke.  After some searching I found a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions6409370uitableviewreloaddataautomaticallycallsresignfirstresponderthis SO questiona, and it seemed Id found my answer the app was using codereloadDatacode to refresh the results after every keystroke, and that reload was calling coderesignFirstRespondercode and dismissing the keyboard.  Frustrating, but explained and understood.p  pBut then my boss pointed out that we use almost the exact same code elsewhere in the app, and it works perfectly.  How could that be  I find myself in the unusual position of needing to explain why something DOES work, since the above link would indicate that dismissing the keyboard during codereloadDatacode is the normal behavior.p  pBelow are the relevant methods from the two ViewControllers, each of which is subclassed from the same custom codeUITableViewcode.  The methods have been simplified, but the differing behavior remains.  A part of me thinks that it must be something buried in difference between the two subclasses, but then if codereloadDatacode is the problem and it isnt being overridden anywhere, doesnt that mean the subclasses are irrelevantp  pstrongLookup Viewstrong p  precode voidsearchBarUISearchBar searchBar textDidChangeNSString searchText     [self.tableView reloadData]     NSLogLookup Reloaded  codepre  pstrongSearch Viewstrongp  precode voidsearchBarUISearchBar searchBar textDidChangeNSString searchText     [self.tableView reloadData]     NSLogSearch Reloaded  codepre  pAs you can see, they are identical.  Both are successfully called after each keystroke, and yet the former dismisses the keyboard and the latter does not.p  pEach of these View Controllers is over a thousand lines long, so Im having a hard time narrowing down what might be causing the differing behavior.  Can someone who understands FirstResponders and TableView reloads help give me some leads on where to look  It seems like a fairly simple process a key is pressed  the method is called  it reloads the table  keyboard is dismissed in the process without much room to alter that behavior, but obviously there is a way to prevent that final step because the Search View is already doing it.p  pAny idea where I should focus my search to figure out whyp
