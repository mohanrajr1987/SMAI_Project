Positive 42953 pI have a matrix with several groupsemployees, managers and departments. I have columns sum time expected, sum time entered, sum overtime, sum missing time. At the manager and department level the overtime and missing time skew the results. Basically if a manager has two employees and one has 5 hrs overtime and the other has 5 hrs missing time, the result will show that for the manager there is no overtime or missing time for their employees.. I have tried to add subtotals but I get the same outcome. I have also tried to sumtextbox.value but I get the error that aggregates on textboxes have to be within footers. I believe that subtotal rows should be considered footers but that is not the case. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanksp  pTime Expected   Time Reported    OT     MISSING Total by Manager 80                  80           0      0p  pTotals by Employee 40                  35        0           5 40                  45           5    0p

Positive 42953 pI inherited an old instance of SSRS 2008R2 dating back 6 years or more.  There are a lot of reports that are old and likely not used.  I have the executionlog tracking for a few months so I started looking at cleaning up reports that are not used.  However subreports and the base report for a linked report do not show up in executionlog. I can find out which reports have linked reports but not which ones are subreports. What I am thinking is, if I disable a report not hide it, actually prevent its execution I can begin to clean up the server. If I find out there is an error I can just enable the report. Is there a way to disable execution Disable from manual or subscription There is a field [ReportServer].[dbo].[Catalog].[ExecutionFlag] but I cannot find any documentation on it. p  pOther then deleting the report and deploying it again, is there a way to disable a report execution p  pOf course if I could track subreport execution that would be great too. Feel free to toss out any other ideas on cleaning up an old reporting server as well.p  pThanksp

Positive 42953 pSo, I have a tablix that I want to be able to sort the row group by the values in the column groups.  The kicker is that I want it to sort by the greatest value in the greatest column grouping first and when the sorting for the greatest column group has come to an empty row then I want it to go to the next column group and sort the rest again until it goes through all of the column groups.  The other kicker is that I want it to be dynamic so that when the year rolls over I wont have to change the report for the years that will show.p  pFor example my tablix has customers in the rows and years across the top and shows revenue per year and Id like the results to sort by the value from the latest year first then sort by the values in the second greatest year and so on until it sorts the whole tablix.  I also need it to be dynamic so that I dont have to change it when the year rolls over to the next year.p  pIve tried to add my year to the Sum function I used to sort it, but that didnt work.p
