Positive 231 pI am very much new to PHP programming and bluemix as well. I was looking for connecting to PHP to bluemix. For that I created SQL DB DB2 database in Bluemix and bind it to my app also. Then got the credentials and used it in php using codedb2connectcode. It didnt work and returned connection failed.p  pAfter that I got thisp  precodevcapservices  jsondecodeENV[VCAPSERVICES ] db  vcapservicesgtmysql5.5[0]gtcredentials mysqldatabase  dbgtname mysqlportdbgtport mysqlservername dbgthostdbgtport mysqlservername dbgthost .  . dbgtport mysqlusername  dbgtusername mysqlpassword  dbgtpassword  con  mysqlconnectmysqlservername, mysqlusername, mysqlpassword codepre  pMy question is, should I replace mysql with db2 Or itll run like this just changing mysql5.5 to sqldbp  pI used codedb2connectcode also and it is not working.p
Positive 231 pI have a query to a DB2 database on an iSeries that I wish to run from a C program. The query isp  precodeSELECT C.CLINO, SUMT.VALUE AS VALUE  FROM GTDATA.CLIENT AS C  INNER JOIN TABLEGETHOLDDTLC.CLINO,20150630,,Y,Y,,,,,,,,,,M AS T ON T.CLIENT  C.CLINO  GROUP BY C.CLINO codepre  pGETHOLDDTL is an SQL function supplied to us by a third party to allow us to retrieve data from their system in our own programs.p  pWhen I run the query in the iSeries interactive SQL environment, saving the output to a file to ensure that Im getting a time for the execution over the whole dataset, it takes approximately 1.5 hours to run. This is fine, as theres a lot of data which is being calculated on the fly. The problem is that when I run my C program, the process takes in excess of 24 hours ie thats the point at which I gave up, when it hadnt got past this point the morning after I started execution.p  pThe C code Im using to execute the query isp  precodevar conn  new OdbcConnection  conn.ConnectionString  FILEDSNSqsys2.dsnUIDXXXXXXXPWDXXXXXXXX  conn.ConnectionTimeout  0 conn.Open var com  new OdbcCommandselectCommand, conn var reader  com.ExecuteReader var dt  new DataTable dt.Loadreader  conn.Close codepre  pThe delay is happening on the dt.Load line  this is presumably where the query is actually executedp  pWhat might account for the difference Is there a better way to implement this If necessary, I can produce the data using the interactive SQl environment, and change my C code to use the file that produces, but Im trying to get this to run without any user interaction so Id like to avoid that if possible.p  pThanks for any help.p
