Positive 115 pSo Im having this Text Field that users can input anything based on the languages installed on their keyboard. Im asked to limit them to only use Arabic. The example is like this a hrefhttpepay.sanjesh.orgPaymentCustomer.aspxidWcAGgjZVzEk relnofollowhttpepay.sanjesh.orgPaymentCustomer.aspxidWcAGgjZVzEkap  pIn that link, you are only allowed to input Arabic language. Even if your keyboard language is set on English, it still writes Arabic. I was thinking of using langar.  Is that correct if it is, then how should I use itp
