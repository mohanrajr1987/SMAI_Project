IBM doc implies that the timestamp is when that operation occurred a hrefhttpwww01.ibm.comsupportknowledgecenterSSYKE27.0.0com.ibm.java.zos.71.docdiagtoolsgcpdverboseoperation.html relnofollowhttpwww01.ibm.comsupportknowledgecenterSSYKE27.0.0com.ibm.java.zos.71.docdiagtoolsgcpdverboseoperation.htmla. However, when looking at the timestamps and durations for the operation identified by timems attributes, the numbers dont add up. They do add up and make sense, however, if the timestamp is interpreted as when the operation finished, not when it started. To illustrate, in the example output above the following operations were performed, and these are their provided durations and timestamps Ive rounded the numbersp  pre     operation  duration  timestamp     mark  609ms  4846.429     classunload  1ms  4846.430     sweep  19ms  4846.449     compact  2209ms  4848.658 pre  pAs one can see, the timestamps dont make sense if theyre interpreted as the start time. They do, however, if interpreted as the end time. For instance, the classunload timestamp value equals the makr timestamp plus the classunload duration not plus the mark duration as it should be if the timestamps indicate when the operations started. Similarly, the sweep timestamp equals the classunload timestamp plus the sweep duration.p  pCan someone confirm if this is expected behavior, or am I simply just reading this incorrectlyp  p2 Another issue appears to be that the entirely of every operation in the log appears to be a fullstopthe world operation from start to finish. I expected that the scavenge GCs would all be full stops, however, all the documentation Ive seen from IBM has indicated that at least part of the mark phase of the global GC should be done concurrently. However, that is also not what is occurring in the GC log entry above. In this example, it appears that everything is done as a fullstop, and that no part of the mark or either the sweep is done concurrently. Per older documentation at least part of the mark should be done concurrently as not all as part of the stoptheworld pause a hrefhttpwww.ibm.comdeveloperworksjavalibraryjibmjava2 relnofollowhttpwww.ibm.comdeveloperworksjavalibraryjibmjava2a Is there a setting to make the global GCs in the tenured generation run part of the cycle concurrently I know this is being done in the IBM JREs optavgpause collector as well as the Hotspot concurrent collector, neither of which are particularly new technology, so its not clear why gencon is always forcing a full stoptheworld every time it has to do a global collection. This is important, as the 2.8 second pause indicated above is going to make us run afoul of our SLAs with the client. p  p3 In the global GC above its apparent from the occupancy numbers of the nursery that it is also being collected during this operation the nursery shows as only 8 free before the GC and 89 after. However, Im not seeing the relevant information regarding a GC occuring in the nursery in the output. I would expect to see a scavange operation logged here. Does anyone know why this is missing Is this because during a global GC the nursury is also collected via the same heap walking marksweepcompact approach as the tenured space is when a global GC occursp

Negative 2149 pI often use the filterhorizontal attribute for manytomany relationships which renders a FilteredSelectMultiple widget.p  pThe downside of this widget arises when the user needs to be able to order the objects. p  pThis is not user friendly because the order can only be modified on the changeview of the object itself.
