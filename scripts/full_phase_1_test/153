Negative 153 pThis question is regarding a pattern that  observed while doing some maintenance work on Node.js project with Backbone.js in front end and Express framework in the backend. Usually, when I use backbone.js in the frontend, I will create routes using Backbone.js router component and then render views based on the route being accessed by the user. For example, if the user is accessing codeusersettingscode, it will load the codeUserSettingsViewcode and the associated modelUser. However, in this project, the way the guy who wrote the code is using Backbone.js is quite different. First of all, the router component and Backbone.js routes are not at all used. All the routing is handled by Express itself. When a page loads, it is initially checked wheather a codedivcode with a specific id is present in the page and if it exists, then a specific Backbone.js view is initiated and that divs id passed to that view as the codeelcode and the associated modelcollection is fetched and rendered. For example, see the code belowp  precodeprofileEdit  profileedit if profileEdit.length    profileEdit  new App.ProfileView     el profileEdit,     model user     codepre  pMy question is, is this a recommended pattern to use Are there any disadvantagesadvantages of using this pattern over the conventional pattern p
