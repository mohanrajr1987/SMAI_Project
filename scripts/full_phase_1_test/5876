Positive 5876 pHere is the setup. I have apache2 load balancing 4 instances of tomcat 7. This is on ubuntu 15.04. To create the instances I copied the tomcat7 directory in varlib and named the instances tomcat1, tomcat2, and tomcat3. All ports and settings are set up and it is mostly working fine. p  pWhen the balancer sends the request to the original tomcat7 instance I get a 500 level error. But only on that original instance. The others work fine. Here is the errorp  pjava.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError servletsTransactionLoader  Unsupported major.minor version 52.0 unable to load class servlets.TransactionLoaderp  pI know what the error means, I just dont know why the only instance that crashes is the original one when the other instances are copies, and where the config file is to point that instance to the correct JDK. It seems in ubuntu that the setup and config files for any given apptomcat, apache2, etc... are scattered through the file system. Thus I cannot remember where to set what variable. p  pI can say that JAVAHOME is not properly set in etcenvironment as I get nothing when I echo JAVAHOME . Ill rectify that now but I dont think that will solve this issue. p

Negative 5876 pI have a variable amount of elements in a fixed sized div. As long as there lt 5 elements they have enough space to sit side by side. But as soon as there are more, I want them to slightly overlap each other more and more, so they all stay inside the div. Think of it as holding a variable amount of cards in a game. I cant think of any way to do this, aside from controlling it manually with JavaScript on addingremoving elements. Is there a way to let the browser handle this effect for mep
