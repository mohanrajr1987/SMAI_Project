Positive 982 pThis is not really a technical programming question, but it has to do with dealing with and displaying time zones in Java.p  pIn the United States, there are time zones like codeEastern Timecode and codePacific Timecode, that during Daylight Savings, they are codeEastern Daylight Timecode and codePacific Daylight Timecode, while when Daylight Savings is not in effect, they are codeEastern Standard Timecode and codePacific Standard Timecode.p  pSo, since Daylight Saving Time starts on the second Sunday of March, and ends on the first Sunday of November, would saying that a date between March and November is in codeEastern Standard Timecode or codePacific Standard Timecode be invalid For example, does the following date technically not existp  blockquoteTuesday, September 29, 2015 at 10 am PSTblockquote  pShould it not be codePacific Daylight Time PDTcode, or just simply codePTcode to avoid having to specify codeDaylightcode or codeStandardcodep

Positive 982 pIm attempting to get an accurate GMT Unix timestamp thats universally accurate regardless of whether or not the users device has its own time set to slighter faster or slower some people do that. p  pMy first approach was to use a simple web service that returned the GMT timestamp and the valeu was saved as a starting point. Id then manually maintain it by incrementing it ever 1000ms, but this is not an ideal solution as it relies on an external service. p  pUsing code[NSDate timeIntervalSince1970]code is a 90 solution because it factors in the offset  of your custom time configuration. p  pThis probably seems a little extreme, but I have a valid use case where tokens need to be compared on two completely disconnected systems and the only common understanding would be time. p
