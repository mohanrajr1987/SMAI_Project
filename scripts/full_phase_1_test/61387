Negative 61387 pI have a document that looks somthing likep  precode  id  foo,  rev  bar,  type  User,  settings  foo  bar, far  boo,  email  foobar.com  some  foo,  other  bar,  stuff  fooBar  data  LOTS OF DATA  codepre  pNow Im assuming a view over a doc that includes that data field and the lots of data it actually holds imagine it full of 500 lines of text is going to cause indexes to become massive if you have lots of users and multiple views of that datap  pSo one solution assuming my above assumption is correct is to create a view over everything, except the data, field that you can that use lists against, etc. And when you actually want the data field go and get the actual document based on the id in the view. The problem with this is it means users will need to make 2 GETs.p  pthe other solution I came up with was to have the view refer to the document id it was a view of, then create a list over that view. If the strongincludedocstruestrong flag is set on the query string then the list copypastes the data field out of the included copy of the original document into the view data and returns the augmented view.p  pThat may be the way things are supposed to be done but it did feel like a hack and I wanted to run it past some more knowledgeable folks before actually doing it.p  pMy goal here was to return a view of a document removing and Couchy stuff like rev, RESTifying links to other, related, documents, etc from a single request by any field except data that I have as a key in some view. Allowing users to select a user document or any other document based on any field value this would then use virtual hosts and url rewriting to hide away the fact it has got a long, ugly url that references design docs, views, lists and has a very couchy flag tagged on the end. e.gp  precodewhatever.comusersemailvaluefoobar.com codepre  porp  precodewhatever.comusersothervaluebar codepre  pObviously if what I was told about including large data fields in a view is just not true then this is all redundant. p  pexample of the view p  precodefunctiondoc           ifdoc.type  User             emitdoc.email,                  id  doc.id,                   settings doc.settings,                 some  doc.some,                 other  doc.other,                 stuff  doc.stuff               codepre  pexample of the listp  precodefunctionhead, req              var row  getRow              startheaders ContentType texthtml              send rows [             while row                   ifreq.query.includedocs                     row.value.data  row.doc.data                                        sendJSON.stringifyrow.value                  row  getRow                  ifrow                     send,                          send]  codepre  pLike I said previously this feels hacky and I could use some advice on either a nicer approach or any way of tidying this up p
