Positive 77851 pI have a modal view that Im presenting over the current view that has a codeUINavigationBarcode as a subview. Everythings working great, except that the codeUINavigationBarcode doesnt want to behave according to the autolayout constraints. Everything else in the view behaves as desired.p  pFor some reason, the left and right bar button items are cut off on the edges of the view. I inspected the view at runtime to reveal that the total width of the codeUINavigationBarcode is the right width, but the bar buttons arent conforming.p  pI also checked to make sure I didnt have negative margins or some other anomaly in the constraint definitions.p  pI have also tried setting the frame of the codeUINavigationBarcode manually, but it yielded no improvement.p  pstrongProblematic Viewstrongp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comopNWG.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comopNWG.png altap  pstrongConstraintsstrongp  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comDoNum.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comDoNum.png altap  pId like to keep the codeUINavigationBarcode, because it gets styled globally with the rest of my app as opposed to creating a custom codeUIViewcode imitation and styling it individually.

Positive 77851 pIm attempting to refactor code that programmatically creates autolayout constraints on a UIScrollView that is a subview of a UITableViewCells contentView but am getting some unusual effects.p  pCode snippet being replaced isp  precodelet scrollViewHorizontalConstraints  NSLayoutConstraint.constraintsWithVisualFormatH[sv],options [], metrics nil, views viewDictionary viewConstraints.appendContentsOfscrollViewHorizontalConstraints  scrollviewConstraints is an array let scrollViewVerticalConstraints  NSLayoutConstraint.constraintsWithVisualFormatV[sv], options [], metrics nil, views viewDictionary codepre  pI should be able to replace this with the new iOS9 UILayoutAnchor API as followsp  precodescrollView.leftAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchorcontentView.leftAnchor.active  true scrollView.rightAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchorcontentView.rightAnchor.active  true scrollView.topAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchorcontentView.topAnchor.active  true scrollView.bottomAnchor.constraintEqualToAnchorcontentView.bottomAnchor.active  true codepre  pHowever, this code fails no errors. Constraints are not built correctly  the resulting scrollView matches the height of the superview but not the width despite the fact that it has a subview constrained to the width of the UITableViewCell contentView. The original version works without errors.p  pBuilding the same structure inside a standard UIView using the new notation works so Im suspicious of a bug but any suggestions would be gratefully received.p
Positive 77851 pMaybe striving for a warning free project is futile, but I am nervous enough about Adaptive Layout AutoLayout that I am compelled to try and squash these warnings.p  pI have a uiview that I want to be dynamically sized based on the portrait screen width. I have my app set in the Build Info for Universal, Portrait only and upside down. I have constrained the uiview the following waysp  ol liAligned the views Center to Superviews center Xli liMade the views width proportional to the Superviews widthli liGave the view an aspect ratio constraint of 11li liGiven the view a vertical constraint to the superviews topli ol  pFor details please see the screenshot below.p  pSo now I get the warnings about the views frame being different at run time, in particular the size and position at runtime versus what is in the canvas. Not sure why Xcode cares about the canvas where the class sizes are set to Any height and Any width. I thought the whole point of Adaptive layout is that sizes and positions are resolved at runtime based on the devices screen size and orientation.p  pIf I breakdown and let Xcode Update frames... yes the warning goes away, but with the super large views it is virtually impossible to work graphically in the tiny canvas in a WYSIWIG fashion. Any solution here to getting rid of the warnings without creating oversized views that make working inside the canvas nearly impossiblep  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.com0Hbcr.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com0Hbcr.png altCanvas screenshotap
