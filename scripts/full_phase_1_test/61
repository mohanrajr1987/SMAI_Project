The label indicating the number of timer invocations updates each second or so and the immediate but factually incorrect display of the statement that Timer has been invalidated p  pHowever, it my expectation that decommenting any of the three lines that follow should allow the timer to run through 10 iterations, and then be invalidated, allowing the Timer invalidated message to display. Instead, however, I end up stuck infinitely in the empty loop, as if the conditions never come true.  The UI does not update at all.p  pInstead of testing the timer, I also tried testing the counter z, but this does not work either, leading me to believe there is something more elemental at play that I am not understanding. For example,  using codewhile z gt 0  printlnz is zcode in the location results in codez is 0code   the reason the loop is infinite.   But again, if I comment out the line, z does in fact clearly increment, as the label DOES change, reflecting the cane in the counter z.p  pAgain, Im looking more to understand WHY things are failing i.e., what I am failing to comprehend here.   I understand, for example, I could make this work by having the doTimedAction func directly update the label  but that would not help me understand why my tests fail.p
