Positive 49 pIm new to Symfony2 and have a question.

Positive 49 pI have a PHP script that collects leads from my website, and I asked a few business owners to test it for me.

Positive 49 pI have something thats been puzzling me, so I thought Id ask here.p  pIm building a form in a Symfony2 project, and one of the fields is an entity, which will add the value to a join table. The entity in this case is called Vehicle and the table contains information about a vehicle in a fleet. However, there are two fields that make up the vehicle name, i.e. Make and Model. When I use this entity in my form, I can only seem to use ONE property either Make or Model and not concatenate them.p  pHere is the code that renders the Vehicle drop down entity in the formp  precodebuildergtaddvehicle  , entity,         array             class gt AppBundleVehicle,             label gt Vehicle,             emptyvalue gt  Please Select ,             property gt model,             multiple gt false          codepre  pIn this case, the drop down will only show the Model, and not the Make. Is it possible to make it so I can concatenate these in order to show both Make and Model in my form For examplep  precodebuildergtaddvehicle  , entity,         array             class gt AppBundleVehicle,             label gt Vehicle,             emptyvalue gt  Please Select ,             property gt make  model,             multiple gt false          codepre  pOr something like that so that the drop down will read Ford Transit instead of just Transitp  pAny help appreciated.

Negative 49 pI am trying to insert double values to my database via EF 5. I generated EF entity model from db. There is a price column in the table which is float, and naturally EF generated a double type for the mapper class.  I read some string values from a file and convert it to double and save it to db. When I debug I can see that values are converted correctly. For example string value code120,53code is converted to double like code120.53code, just fine. But when I save my context it goes to db like code12053code.p  pWhat can cause such a problem Is there any setting in SQL Server has anything to do with thisp

Negative 49 pI cant decide if this is a dumb question or not but Ill take the risk. p  pIm a fairly simple SQL user   I understand CREATEDROP tables and SELECT, INSERT, DELETE in their basic forms but not much more. What Id like to know is if theres a way with SQL to request the schema of a tablep  pI have a PC app which uses SQLite and Im writing a mobile client for it. I dont need all of the tables from the PC DB and not all columns from the tables. In SQLite Spy, I can rightclick a table and select Show CREATE statement which generates the SQL needed to recreate the table.p  pWhat Id like to do using code on the PC to get the CREATE statement or at least the schema of the SQLite tables I need and then edit the strings to include only the columns I need. These could then be passed to my mobile app so it could create the subset DB on the device. Is it possiblep  pstrongEDITstrong For anyone who comes after me looking for a similar answer. Thanks to dan04 pointing me in the right direction. The results of using...p  precodeSELECT  FROM sqlitemaster codepre  p... include a column called sql which includes the CREATE statement.
