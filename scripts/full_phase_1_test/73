Positive 73 pMainly have 2 questions in respect to this topicp  ol lipIm looking to get the row counts of a few CSV files. In Bash, I know I can do codewc l lt filename.csvcode. How do I do this and subtract 1 from it because of headerspli lipFor anyone familiar with CSV files and possible issues with grabbing raw line count, how plausible is it that a line is wrapped across multiple lines I know that this is a very possible scenario, but want to say that this never happens. In the event of this being a possibility, would using Pythons codecsvcode package be better to use Does it read lines based on delimiters and other column wrappers pli ol
Positive 73 pIm using a function I found here a hrefhttpwww.mrexcel.comforumexcelquestions82293appendcsv.html relnofollowApend2CSVa to append changed rows to a CSV file.  Ive used this process successfully in several different projects now, but this time it is leaving out the first two columns that Im trying to append.  As far as I can tell, everything is set up right, and Im hoping someone with a better eye for this can point out where my problem is.  The code is triggered by a WorksheetChange event, but it is a separate procedure because it is also called by other parts of the program.  p  pIn this case, RangeA4BB4 is supposed to get appended, but only RangeC4BB4 actually does. This is a calculated range with formulas that account for the potential weirdness of .csv, such as quotes and commas in text, by replacing every instance of codecode with codecode and wrapping all values in quotes before the values get appended.p  pHeres the codep  precodeSub Append2CSV     SheetsToCSV.Calculate     Dim tmpCSV As String     Dim f As Integer     Const CSVFile As String  CTheCSVWBCSV.csv      f  FreeFile     Open CSVFile For Append As f      tmpCSV  Range2CSVSheetsToCSV.RangeA4BB4      Print f, tmpCSV     Close f     ThisWorkbook.Saved  True End Sub codepre  hr  precodePrivate Function Range2CSVlist As String     Dim tmp As String     Dim cr As Long     Dim r As Range      If TypeNamelist  Range Then         cr  1         For Each r In list.Cells             If r.Row  cr Then                 If tmp  vbNullString Then                     tmp  r.Value                 Else                     tmp  tmp amp , amp r.Value                 End If             Else                 cr  cr  1                 If tmp  vbNullString Then                     tmp  r.Value                 End If             End If         Next     End If     Range2CSV  tmp End Function codepre  pHeres the text from the .csv filep  precodeA,AscendSKU,UPCNumber,VendorPartNumber,MFGPartNumber,Divison,G,PhysicalQOHAtTimeOfRecord,AscendQOHAtTimeOfRecord,ChosenVendor,Status,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,Cost,Price,V,W,Location,DateRecordCreated,Z,UniqueID,DateTimeSerial,CurrentAscendQOH,CurrentAscendQOO,CurrentAscendYTD,Brand,ClickHereToStartBuyerModeCategory,AH,DateRecordModified,AJ,AK,AL,AM,AN,AO,AP,AQ,AR,AS,AT,AU,AV,AW,AX,AY,ChangedDuringBuyerMode ,11833300044D,879410002474,ST6284,ST6284,1,1181 HIRISE 118x31.8 STEM,,0,Hawley,,,,,,,,,,9.01,19.99,,,,42277,,42277.5861111111...11833300044D,42277.5861111111,,,,ELEVEN81,Parts  Stems  Mountain and Hybrid,,42277.6491435185,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,CHA27625539K,719676285276,608140424,608140424,1,16 SPEC CHAMONIX HELMET,,2,Specialized Bicycle Components,,,,,,,,,,19.6,49.99,,,,42277,,42277.5841550926...CHA27625539K,42277.5841550926,,,,Specialized,Accessories  Helmets  Road  z.Mens,,42277.6491666666,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,CHA27625539K,719676285276,608140424,608140424,1,16 SPEC CHAMONIX HELMET,,2,Specialized Bicycle Components,,,,,,,,,,19.6,49.99,,,,42277,,42277.5841550926...CHA27625539K,42277.5841550926,,,,Specialized,Accessories  Helmets  Road  z.Mens,,42277.6491666666,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,WMS291257455,072774380459,38045,38045,1,WM SOLID RR AXLE SET 38x26x126x175,0,0,J amp B Importers,,,,,,,,,,1.69,5.99,,,,42041,,42041.6198495370...WMS291257455,42041.619849537,,,,WHEEL MASTER,Parts  Hubs  Axles and Nuts and Cones,,42277.6496064815,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,WMS291257455,072774380459,38045,38045,1,WM SOLID RR AXLE SET 38x26x126x175,0,0,J amp B Importers,,,,,,,,,,1.69,5.99,,,,42041,,42041.6198495370...WMS291257455,42041.619849537,,,,WHEEL MASTER,Parts  Hubs  Axles and Nuts and Cones,,42277.6496064815,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,FLS17361201Z,036121700116,FL4050,FL4050,1,FL SHOCK OIL 5WT.16OZ GET 2,,0,Bicycle Technologies International,O,,,,,,,,,8.95,19.99,,,,42063,,42063.7094444444...FLS17361201Z,42063.7094444444,,,,FINISH LINE,Accessories  Maintenance  Suspension Fluid,,42277.6517939815,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,FLS17361201Z,036121700116,FL4050,FL4050,1,FL SHOCK OIL 5WT.16OZ GET 2,,0,Bicycle Technologies International,O,,,,,,,,,8.95,19.99,,,,42063,,42063.7094444444...FLS17361201Z,42063.7094444444,,,,FINISH LINE,Accessories  Maintenance  Suspension Fluid,,42277.6552893519,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,FLS17361201Z,036121700116,FL4050,FL4050,1,FL SHOCK OIL 5WT.16OZ GET 2,,0,Bicycle Technologies International,O,,,,,,,,,8.95,19.99,,,,42063,,42063.7094444444...FLS17361201Z,42063.7094444444,,,,FINISH LINE,Accessories  Maintenance  Suspension Fluid,,42277.6552893519,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, ,SPE298655664,719676126357,5423700,5423700,1,SPEC FLATBOY GLUELESS PATCHKIT 14,8,18,Specialized Bicycle Components,,,,,,,,,,1.44,2.99,,,,42063,,42063.7109722222...SPE298655664,42063.7109722222,,,,Specialized,Accessories  Flat Repair and Prevention  Patch Kits  Glueless,,42277.6569791666,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, codepre
Positive 73 pI have a csv file with several hundred organism IDs and a second csv file with several thousand organism IDs and additional characteristics taxonomic information, abundances per sample, etcp  pI am trying to write a code that will extract the information from the larger csv using the smaller csv file as a reference.  Meaning it will look at both smaller and larger files, and if the IDs are in both files, it will extract all the information form the larger file and write that in a new file basically write the entire row for that ID.p  pso far I have written the following, and while the code does not error out on me, I get a blank file in the end and I dont exactly know why.

Positive 73 pMy CSV contains about 60 million rows. The 10th column contains some alphanumeric entries, some of which repeat, that I want to convert into integers with a onetoone mapping. That is, I dont want the same entry in codeOriginal.csvcode to have multiple corresponding integer values in codeProcessed.csvcode. So, initially, I wrote the following codep  precoderequire csv udids  [] CSV.openOriginal.csv, wb do csv     CSV.foreachProcessed.csv, headersgttrue do row          unless udids.includerow[9]             udids ltlt row[9]          end          udid  udids.indexrow[9]  1          array  [udid]     csvltltarray   end end codepre  pBut, the program was taking a lot of time, which I soon realized was because it had to check all the previous rows to make sure only the new values get assigned a new integer value, and the existing ones are not assigned any new value.p  pSo, I thought of hashing them, because when exploring the web about this issue, I learnt that hashing is faster than sequential comparing, somehow I have not read the details about the how, but anyway... So, I wrote the following code to hash themp  precodearrayUDID[] arrayUser[] arrayHash[] array1[]  f  File.openOriginal.csv, r f.eachline  line     row  line.split,     arrayUDIDltltrow[9]     arrayUserltltrow[9]   arrayUser  arrayUser.uniq arrayHash  []  for i in 0..arrayUser.size1     arrayHashltltarrayUser[i]     arrayHashltlti end  hash  Hash[arrayHash.eachslice2.toa]  array1hash.valuesat arrayUDID  logfile  File.newProcessed.csv,w for i in 0..array1.size1     logfile.printarray1[i]n end logfile.close codepre  pBut here again, I observed that the program was taking a lot of time, which I realized must be due to the hash array or hash table running out of memory.p  pSo, can you kindly suggest any method that will work for my huge file in a reasonable amount of time By reasonable amount, I mean within 10 hours, because I realize that its going to take some hours at least as it took about 5 hours to extract that dataset from an even bigger dataset. So, with my aforementioned codes, it was not getting finished even after 2 days of running the programs. So, if you can suggest a method which can do the task by leaving the computer on overnight, that would be great. Thanks.p
