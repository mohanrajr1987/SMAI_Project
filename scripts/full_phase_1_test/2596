However, stepping through the flow, I notice the string passed to gridViewClientLayout has no column width information. My above method ignores the new layout information as technically it sees no change to the layout data and therefore does not save the layout It then refreshes the grid reads the users layout from the Db which means column widths are reset to that of whatever is saved in the Db.p  pHeres an example of the LayoutData string before width is resizedp  precodepage1sort1a20conditions1413436383103123133143153193203213223233visible24f0f3t0f16f2f16t1f16t6f16t7f16t4t5f10f9t11t12f14f13t8f16f13f16width24ee60pxeeeeeeeee300pxeeeeeeeeeee codepre  pHeres what the LayoutData looks like being passed to girdViewClientLayout when rezising occursp  precodepage1sort1a20conditions1413436383103123133143153193203213223233visible24f0f3t0f16f2f16t1f16t6f16t7f16t4t5f10f9t11t12f14f13t8f16f13f16width24ee60pxeeeeeeeee300pxeeeeeeeeeee codepre  pExactly the same Im expecting something like the above string but with more sections ending in px.

Ill be implementing an XML alternative soon but even then, it too requires column width information which is not stored in ASPxClientLayoutArgs.LayoutData meaning Id have to implement a dirty hack to inject this column width information into the XML structure. But thats a problem for another day.p  pAnyone have any suggestions This is not a huge problem, I mean its just column widths, but my scrum master would really like it included in our next deploy which is being delayed by this problem. Hes a really cool guy and Id really hate to disappoint him with something so small and insignificant.p  pThanks guys, JeanPierrep

Useful in some websites, but useless for the Online Users list, since it updateds when a new request is sent, and since there wont be any requests after the user closes the browser.p  pAlso mentioned in other answers is the use of codesession.gcmaxlifetimecode and codesession.cookielifetimecode, but the Best answer states that using them is a bad idea One doesnt destroy the session, just the cookies, and the other is costintensive.p  pWhat I want is the user to time out and the database to update and mark the user as Offline strongwithoutstrong using the IfConditional sentence, or maybe with using a different Ifconditional sentence that only has to be used once when the user logs in, like a timer or something, and whenever a request is sent, the timer restarts...those are just my ideas so far on how to solve this problem.p  pBut, how do I do this Im sorry if the answer is something very simple and obvious, Im very new to PHP.p  pEdit strongLong Story Shortstrongp  pI want to run a function after the user emcloses his browserem, or is inactive for 20 minutes.p  pstrongClarification...strongp  pI want to update the database after 20 minutes of inactivity strongeven ifstrong the browser has been closed.p
