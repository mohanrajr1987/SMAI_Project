Negative 353 pI have Access Database table with multiple overlapping schedule. I hought it will be simple for me to create Bu faced with some overlapping existing time range. If an user approves a schedule for one employee. When user goes to approve next schedule with overlapping time for the same employee. I Need to create an alert message  when user approves overlapping schedule and delete  approved text from the table. Not much knowledge about VB code or if there is something I can set up in query. Any help will be appreciated.p
