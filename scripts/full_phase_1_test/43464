Negative 43464 pIm working on a basic Rails 4.0 app to learn how it works, and Ive run into something that I cant seem to figure out. Ive been doing queries to the default Sqlite DB via ActiveRecord, and for most queries, according to the debug output, it seems to generate parameterized queries, like sop  precode2.0.0p247 070 gt file.save    0.2ms  begin transaction    SQL 0.6ms  UPDATE repfiles SET reportid  , filename  , updatedat      WHERE repfiles.id  275  [[reportid, 3], [filename, hello.jpg],    [updatedat, Mon, 09 Sep 2013 043019 UTC 0000]]    28.8ms  commit transaction codepre  pHowever, whenever I do a query using findby, it seems to just stick the provided parameters into the generated SQLp  precode2.0.0p247 063 gt file  RepFile.findbyreportid 29, filename 1.png   RepFile Load 6.2ms  SELECT repfiles. FROM repfiles WHERE   repfiles.reportid  29 AND repfiles.filename  1.png LIMIT 1 codepre  pIt does seem to be escaping the parameters properly to prevent SQL injectionp  precode2.0.0p247 066 gt file  RepFile.findbyreportid 29, filename    RepFile Load 0.3ms  SELECT repfiles. FROM repfiles WHERE   repfiles.reportid  29 AND repfiles.filename   LIMIT 1 codepre  pHowever, it was my understanding that sending parameterized queries to the database was considered a better option than trying to escape query strings, since the parameterized option will cause the query data to bypass the databases parsing engine entirely.p  pSo whats going on here Is this some oddity in the Sqlite adapter or the way that the debug output is generated If ActiveRecord is actually working like this, is there some reason for it I cant find anything about this anywhere Ive looked. Ive started looking through the ActiveRecord code, but havent figured anything out yet.p
