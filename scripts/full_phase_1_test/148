Positive 148 pFor a homework assignment which is stated asp  pIn this homework, you will implement a keyvalue hash map with a external chaining collision policy. A hash map maps keys to values and allows O1 average case lookup of a value when the key is known. This hash map must be backed by an array of initial size 11, and must have a size of 2n  1 when the table exceeds greater than, not greater than or equal to a load factor of 0.67. The array must be resized before the new key regardless of whether or not its a duplicate is actually added into the array. The load factor and initial size values are provided as constants in the interface and should be used within your code.p  pWere given a MapEntry class already written, and a HashMap class to write up. How would I intialize this array codeprivate MapEntryltK, Vgt[] table  new MapEntryltgt[STARTINGSIZE]code doesnt work because of the generics situation.p

Positive 148 pSo, I was looking through the Oracle Java Tutorials, specifically this piece of codep  precodeListltEvenNumbergt le  new ArrayListltgt Listlt extends NaturalNumbergt ln  le ln.addnew NaturalNumber35   compiletime error codepre  pwhich can be found a hrefhttpsdocs.oracle.comjavasetutorialjavagenericswildcardGuidelines.html relnofollowherea.  It is my understanding and please correct me if Im wrong that the above code will not work because the compiler does not know that codelncoderefers to a List of EvenNumbers and so this prevents you from accidentally adding any object that could be a supertype of the elements that are meant for the List.  IF that is the case, then why is it that if you have a statement like codeNumber num  new Integer6code the compiler is able to correctly determine that num is an Integer object if you write an if statement like so codeif num instanceof Integer ...codep  pI guess my question is, how is the compiler able to determine that codenumcode is referring to an codeIntegercode object in the second example, but not able to determine that codelncode is referring to a codeListltEvenNumbergtcode object in the first example  p
