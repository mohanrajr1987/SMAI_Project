Positive 8952 pI am trying to compile the Point Cloud Library from source a hrefhttppointclouds.org relnofollowhttppointclouds.orga. After running cmake and make, I receive the following linking errorp  precodeLinking CXX executable ....binpclconvertpcdasciibinary ....liblibpclio.so.1.7.2 undefined reference to pngsetlongjmpfn codepre  pAs a newbie, Im not sure what this error means, but I am assuming the executable file codeplcconvertpcdasciibinarycode which it is trying to build, needs to be linked to the library codelibpclio.so.1.7.2code, but this library contains the function codepngsetlongjumpfuncode, and the definition of this function cannot be foundp  pSo, I have tried looked at some similar questions on Stack Overflow, and it turns out that codepngsetlongjumpfuncode is contained in the codelibpngcode library, but was only introduced after codelibpng1.4.xcode. After running codedpkg l  grep libpngcode, I get the following outputp  precodeii  libpng120amd64                                      1.2.501ubuntu2                                     amd64        PNG library  runtime ii  libpng12dev                                          1.2.501ubuntu2                                     amd64        PNG library  development codepre  pSo it looks like I need to upgrade from codelibpng12devcode to at least codelibpng14devcode. From the libpng website, I see that I can download the source for the latest version but the latest version I can get through codeaptgetcode is only codelibpng12devcode. But I am worried that there may be some conflictions if I have one version installed via aptget, and another version installed manually. However, uninstalling codelibpng12devcode may cause issues if there are packages which depend on this, but are not compatible with the newer version.p  pTherefore, what I would like to know, is whether I should uninstallpurge codelibpng12devcode, and then install the new version manually, or to simply install the new version whilst keeping the old version. And if I do the latter, how can I be sure that the PCL binary I am trying to compile, will link with this new library, rather than the old onep  pThanks p
Positive 8952 pWhen using cmake to link code to a library, I am trying to understand how Ubuntu finds the correct library when there may be more than one version installed.p  pFor example, in my case, I have installed the library codelibpngcode by running codesudo aptget install libpng12devcode. This library is old, but I need to retain it for compatibility with an old project. However, another project of mine requires the updated version, codelibpng16devcode, which is only available as source code, not via codeaptgetcode. So, I downloaded the source, compiled and installed it locally.p  pWhat I am wondering now, is when I have codefindpackagePNGcode in my codeCMakeLists.txtcode file, which version it will findp

Positive 8952 pFor background, Im creating some C software that uses dynamically loaded shared library plugins for hardware output the specifics of it arent relevant here.p  pIm building the executable by compiling everything into object files and then linking the ones needed, which is simple using an exclusion list. I can then build the shared library by specifying its primary object file the one thats dynamically loaded and accessed at runtime along with every other object file referenced by the primary one.p  pMy question is this Is there a way to provide the linker with the primary object file, and create a shared library containing only the objects it depends upon All of the object files are in the same directory, Im not using a Makefile yet if one could solve the problem, its a valid answer, and compilation speed isnt an issue.p  pIve looked into the linker options codeasneededcode, codegcsectionscode, and codenoundefinedcode, but I havent been able to piece together a working build process.p  pExample For source files codemain.cppcode, codea.cppcode, codeb.cppcode, codea.hcode, and codeb.hcode, where codemain.cppcode and codea.cppcode both include codeb.hcodep  pcodegcc fPIC c .cpp I.code builds object files codemain.ocode, codea.ocode, and codeb.ocode.p  pcodegcc o main.out .ocode builds the final executable codemain.outcode from the object files... strongincluding a.o, which is unused.strong codegcsectionscode should fix this.p  pcodegcc fPIC shared o a.so a.o Wl,asneeded a.ocode builds the final shared library codea.socode from all of the object files... strongincluding main.o, which is unusedstrong.

It seems that data is written into database in a particular format, and now I need to encode it into UTF8, but whatever I try I hit a dead end.p  pThis is how the data looks, for examplep  precode     codepre  pAnd these are the most common solutions but none of them seem to workp  ul limysqlquerySET NAMES UTF8 li liheaderContentType texthtml charsetutf8li lichanging database encoding, character sets and still nothing.li ul  pThis is the simple select query Im running SELECT name FROM table LIMIT 20p  pand the data described above is located in this very emtableem inside column emnameem.p  pThe text is in Serbian. p  pAny suggestionsp
Negative 8952 pIm trying to pull in a webpage with phps simple html dom parser and Im having an odd problem with it. I am defining the url variable by concatenating two strings.p  precodeitemUrlhttpwww.example.com pageUrldefault.asppgDispSingleItemampItemNumber1234 itemUrl .pageUrl htmlfilegethtmlitemUrl codepre  pWhen I run this script I end up going to a page that says Item Not Found. However, when I echo the itemUrl, copy the output, and paste it into the browser, I go directly to the page I am looking for. Also, if I just put the entire url saved as one string to begin with it, takes me to the correct webpage.p  precodeitemUrlhttpwww.example.comdefault.asppgDispSingleItemampItemNumber1234 htmlfilegethtmlitemUrl codepre  pI have tried using urlencode on the concatenated string, but that doesnt help. I am really stumped. I cant think of a reason why the concatenated url would take me to a different page when the same url, copied directly and pasted into another variable, takes me to the correct page. What am I missing here Any help would be great, thank you.p  pEDIT I found the issue. The echo of pageUrl showed thisp  precodedefault.asppgDispSingleItemampItemNumber1234 codepre  pWhen in reality the variable was saving a string that looked like thisp  precodedefault.asppgDispSingleItemampampItemNumber1234 codepre  pMy browser was automatically translating the amp amp to simply amp, which looked like exactly what I needed. Whenever I ran filegethtml though, the string was not converted and so the script was trying to get it from a url that had amp amp not just amp. I addedp  precodepageUrlpregreplaceamp, , pageUrl codepre  pDoes anyone know of a way to get a browser to output exactly what the variable is, without altering it like what happened in my problem It would be useful to know in the future.p  pThank you to all of the responses. I wasnt expecting so many or so quickly.p
Negative 8952 pOur Mac cocos2d app httpdeepworldgame.com has been randomly throwing TSMProcessRawKeyCode failed exceptions for some time now, and Im wondering if anyone has experienced this error or knows how to prevent it.p  pIt always happens via the [NSEvent charactersIgnoringModifiers] call within ccKeysDown or ccKeysUp it also happens for [NSEvent characters] without the modifiers. I dont think its related to specific keys. Sometimes it only happens one time and the app continues to function afterward if the exception is caught, but other times it essentially locks up keyboard input indefinitely and continues to cause exceptions with all future keypresses again, when these exceptions are caught.p  pIve found little on the internets regarding this issue, unfortunately. One place I did find was in the Adium source code httpsbitbucket.orgadiumadiumsrc6d1f9b903525SourceAIExceptionController.m, which catches this exception with the comments p  precodeIgnore various known harmless or unavoidable exceptions From the system or system hacks  ...  [TSMProcessRawKeyCode] May be raised by [NSEvent charactersIgnoringModifiers] codepre  pIt is indeed harmless when thrown once, but when the occasion happens that it continuously fires, its a real problem  especially when youre in fullscreen mode and cant use cmdF to escapep  pSo, if anyone has any thoughts or experience, I would be HIGHLY grateful. This is pretty much the one remaining superbug in our application, and I would love to squash it into dust.p  pThanksp  pHere is the typical stack trace MacManager.m is our object which implements the cocos2d keyboard delegate protocolp  precodeCrashed Thread  7  CVDisplayLink  Exception Type  EXCBREAKPOINT SIGTRAP Exception Codes 0x0000000000000002, 0x0000000000000000  Application Specific Information objc[28871] garbage collection is OFF  Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInternalInconsistencyException, reason TSMProcessRawKeyCode failed 192  Call stack at first throw  0   CoreFoundation                      0x95b27d87 raiseError  231 1   libobjc.A.dylib                     0x9315a149 objcexceptionthrow  155 2   CoreFoundation                      0x95a8f619 [NSException raiseformatarguments]  137 3   CoreFoundation                      0x95a8f589 [NSException raiseformat]  57 4   AppKit                              0x9ac01c1f convertEventRefToString  300 5   AppKit                              0x9ab23b5e [NSEvent charactersIgnoringModifiers]  880 6   Deepworld                           0x0001fd8a [MacManager ccKeyDown]  65 7   CoreFoundation                      0x95a7d091 [NSObject performSelectorwithObject]  65 8   Deepworld                           0x0006bc95 [CCEventDispatcher keyDown]  80 9   CoreFoundation                      0x95a7d091 [NSObject performSelectorwithObject]  65 10  Deepworld                           0x0006c014 [CCEventDispatcher dispatchQueuedEvents]  143 11  Deepworld                           0x0006a9a4 [CCDirectorDisplayLink getFrameForTime]  155 12  Deepworld                           0x0006aaf1 MyDisplayLinkCallback  40 13  CoreVideo                           0x9b44a5e1 ZN13CVDisplayLink9performIOEP11CVTimeStamp  489 14  CoreVideo                           0x9b4494e4 ZN13CVDisplayLink11runIOThreadEv  876 15  CoreVideo                           0x9b449161 ZL13startIOThreadPv  160 16  libsystemc.dylib                   0x968a4ed9 pthreadstart  335 17  libsystemc.dylib                   0x968a86de threadstart  34  codepre
