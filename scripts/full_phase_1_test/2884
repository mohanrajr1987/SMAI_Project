Positive 2884 pI have a message driven bean which is communicating with a database via EntityManager. The EM is injected via PersistenceContext, like normal. I want to flush changes to an Entity immediately without waiting for the MDB to fully complete its processing of the given Message. p  pFor examplep  precodeMDBs onMessage    Foo f  em.findFoo.class, 123   f.setNewStatusPerforming work   em.mergef   em.flush   ...    Continue doing a lot of work...   ...    f.setNewStatusDone   em.mergef   em.flush  codepre  pThe problem is that I never see the Performing Work status from outside the context of the MDB e.g. by logging into the DB directly and checking the tuples value.p  pThis appears to be related to transactions. From online material, it sounds like a transaction is started within the context of onMessage and not committed until the method is complete. Hence, the intermediate status is never committed since we eventually write Done which overwrites the Foos value within the PersistentContext. p  pIs there a solution to this type of problem Some way to control the context of the transactionp

Positive 2884 pLets consider two methods codemethodAcode annotated with codeTransactionAttributeTransactionAttributeType.REQUIREDcode default and codemethodBcode annotated with codeTransactionAttributeTransactionAttributeType.REQUIRESNEWcode in a stateless EJB.p  pMaking a nested call to codemethodBcode through codemethodAcode does not startcreate a new transaction as it appears to be regardless of what transaction attribute type is used the target method, since the nested call to codemethodBcode from codemethodAcode uses the codethiscode pointerreference i.e. the actual EJB instance to invoke codemethodBcode which is thus not intercepted by the proxy which is to be injected at runtime by the container and needed to setup the environment before calling a method.p  pBasic demonstration p  precodeStateless public class TestBean implements TestBeanService       PersistenceContext     private EntityManager entityManager       At a glance, this method should cause an exception but it does not.     Override     TransactionAttributeTransactionAttributeType.NEVER     public Long getRowCount          return entityManager.createQuerySELECT counte AS cnt FROM Employee e, Long.class.getSingleResult            This method is invoked by the application client.      making a nested call to getRowCount using the this pointer.     Override     public void test          Long rowCount  getRowCount         System.out.printlnrowCount    rowCount       codepre  pAlthough the codegetRowCountcode method is decorated with codeTransactionAttributeTransactionAttributeType.NEVERcode which should cause an exception at a glance, it successfully returns the number of rows returned by the query.p  p9658 This is because the transaction started by the codetestcode method is propagated expanded to codegetRowCountcode i.e. everything happens within the same single transaction.p  hr  pAn exception would however, be thrown, if the codegetRowCountcode method were to be invoked using a proxy instance obtained through codejavax.ejb.SessionContextcode. This modification is demonstrated by the following snippet.p  precodeStateless public class TestBean implements TestBeanService       PersistenceContext     private EntityManager entityManager      Resource     private SessionContext sessionContext      Override     TransactionAttributeTransactionAttributeType.NEVER     public Long getRowCount          return entityManager.createQuerySELECT counte AS cnt FROM Employee e, Long.class.getSingleResult           Override     public void test           Invocation to getRowCount is done by a proxy instance. Hence, it causes an exception,          since the transaction started by this method is now not propagated to a subsequent call to getRowCount.         Long rowCount  sessionContext.getBusinessObjectTestBeanService.class.getRowCount         System.out.printlnrowCount    rowCount       codepre  pSince the codegetRowCountcode method uses codeTransactionAttributeType.NEVERcode, the above method call to codegetRowCountcode causes the following exception to be thrown contradicting to the first case.p  precodejavax.ejb.EJBException EJB cannot be invoked in global transaction codepre  p9658 This is because the transaction started by the codetestcode method is now strongnotstrong propagated expanded to codegetRowCountcode as happens in the first case because this method is now invoked through a proxy instance thus, not directly through the codethiscode pointer as usual  the actual EJB instance.p  pObtaining a proxy instance through codejavax.ejb.SessionContextcode and invoking a method on that proxy instance is a kind of hack. I do not think it is supposed to be used in real applications.p  pIs there any other way to startcreate a new transaction in a nested method call whenever neededp

Pooling vs Threadsafestrongp  pUser 1 used an instance of codeBeanTestcode and modified the codevarcode using the modify method, then he finished and the container put the instance of codeBeanTestcode in the managed pool. When User 2 tries to use the same bean for a request, he strongmightstrong get the same instance of codeBeanTestcode intially modified by User 1 I understand that might get another instance too. So which state of the instance variable codevarcode he will find default value which is codenullcode or codeTestNamecode if its the new modified one, do that mean that even codeStatelesscode beans are not 100 threadsafe So finnaly there is no container added value regarding thread safety, as not using instance variable makes a bean thread safe even if its not a codeStatelesscode beanp  pstrong2. Pooling vs PreDestroystrongp  pIf the bean is returned to the managed pool and not destroyed, do that mean that the codePredestroycode method will not be called and in that case the connection will stay opened  So, if we have 30 inctance of that bean in the pool, we may have 30 open connection that is not used, isnt that a performance issue or this not how codePredestroycode is working conbined with pooling using codeConnectioncode is just an example, we may have other kind of ressource that we need to close in codePredestroycodep  pstrongNBstrong emThis is not a real life example, so Iam not looking for an alternative solution, my concern is to understand the whole concept and how things are managed in the Application Server, what is happening under the hoodemp
