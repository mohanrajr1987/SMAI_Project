Positive 271 pHei Ive got some code which I want to be documentated by doxygen. Therefore Im interessted in UML diagrams which worked fine  but now I want to use some subgrouping like thisp  precode  name The lame constants  details There are two seperate vectors for the first lame constant in water and ground but only one for the shear module also known as second lame constant, since shear module for water is zero Every element of the vector belongs to one grid point, linear interpolation within vertical direction will be applied. By using this the assumption of an isotrope media is made stdvectorltdoublegt lamw           lt first lame constant for the water area stdvectorltstdcomplexltdoublegt gt lamb    lt first lame constant for the area beyond the seabed stdvectorltdoublegt mub            lt shear module second lame constant for the area beyond the seabed   codepre  pI want a subgroup within the public member group since the variables are defined inside a class.p  pbut what happened is thisp  precode  className            lamw              lamb              mub                lamw              lamb              mub              codepre  pThe strongvariables are displayed twicestrong in the membervariablesection as well as in the methodsection. This of course is not that what I want to happen the parts with the asterix are to much...p  pSo doxygen seems to be confused with the subgrouping I used  did I made some mistake herep

Positive 271 pI work at a small software company, and Im the sole designer. When I am asked to design a new feature for our software, the result will be what we call a design document. After doing some reading, though, it seems theyre more like high level functional specifications.p  pThese functional specifications includep  ol liBusiness Requirement  What problem is the design solvingli liDesign Brief  A very short nonspecific overview of what the solution needs to achieveli liThe Solution  A much more detailed description of how the feature will workli liNew fields  A table of any new fields that need to be created and how they will workwhat restrictions should be placed on them Our software has a lot of forms in itli liA flowchart describing any relevant process flows for the feature to workli liMockups showing how relevant screens should lookli ol  pstrongFirst questionstrong Is functional specification the right term for this kind of document Theyre viewed by people here at the company, so they can understand how the feature will work by the developers, so they can understand what to implement and by the client, so they can comment on whether or not it really meets their business requirements.p  pstrongSecond questionstrong Im looking for a way to move these documents online. Right now I make them in Microsoft Visio, export them as a PNG, and upload them to JIRA. Instead of this, Id like to start using a service which meets the following requirementsp  ol liAllows me to create and store the functional specifications online, as pages rather than files Like an intranet, knowledge base, or wikili liAssigns each document a permalink that will never change Unless I change it myself so that if I share the link once, it will always point to the correct place and I wont have to keep track of where I shared itli liAllows for metadata on each pagedocument. The document will essentially be linked to a JIRA item, and each page will have a reference to the relevant JIRA number, so at the very least Id like a sidebar or other area where such metadata can be entered and easily visible, rather than have it be part of the document itselfli liA templating system, since the functional specifications dont change contents, and Id like to avoid copying and pasting the template in each time Though this could be achieved with a Copy this document functionli liEasy editing. The functional specification will sometimes change, so editing shouldnt be laborious. If the document supports direct editing in an easytouse markup language like Markdown that would be ideal.li liEasily attached or embedded files. Since the mockups and flow chart will be PNG files, itd be nice to be able to simply drag and drop these images into the page, or easily attach them.li ol  pstrongServices Ive tried, and why I havent stuck with themstrongp  pDoctant  ReadMe.io  Knol.io  These are all great in terms of letting people create pages and easily edit them, but theyre targeted towards codetechnical documentation for APIs, and none of them support page metadata that I can tell.p  pPapyrs  This has a nice draganddrop document builder, but it seems geared towards gathering recipient feedback With forms and pages which wont change often after theyre created. It also doesnt have metadata support.p  pemI am, of course, open to alternative methods. I know Ive laid out some pretty exact requirements here, and it might be that what Im looking for doesnt exist, so alternatives will be welcomed. I just want to make storing, editing, and sharing documents easier, with the least possible fuss.emp

Negative 271 pWhat is the defactoconventional practice when enforcing business logic in a REST API and what HTTP Status Codes are usedp  pFor example, lets say that I have a Player entity and a Team entity.  A Team can have any number of players.p  pLets say that my business logic currently prevents a Team from being deleted until all of the Players have been explicitly removed from the Team first.p  pIf you execute a p  pcodeDELETE httpapi.foo.comteams15code p  pand it still has Players associated with it, would you return an HTTP 409 Conflict or an HTTP 412 Precondition Failed  412 seems more logical because I prefer to use 409 for indicating optimistic locking conditions.p  pOr perhaps  should that business logic condition even be enforced at all in a REST API  That is, if someone executes p  pcodeDELETE httpapi.foo.comteams15codep  pshouldnt that just remove all Players and then delete the Team automatically  Is it more conventional to allow the DELETE to execute as the REST API can be perceived as a little lower level or more raw than UI interfacesp  pFinally, what about a query param to in the Resource URIp  pcodeDELETE httpapi.foo.comteams15forcetruecode p  pwhich indicates, Yes, I know that this wouldnt be allowed with players still on the team, but do it anyway.p  pThe idea here is that deleting a Team can be a heavyweight operation with significant repercussions and you only want to do it if the enduser is really sure they want to.p  pIn other words, how much handholding do you do employing are you sure error codes or do you just execute it without any check  Im not quite sure if this should be enforced only in the UI or in the REST API or both.  How do most people solve this todayp

Negative 271 pThis is not a problem, but rather a question that came into my mind. Me along with my friend were trying to disable RowEditing when a user doubleclicks a recordcell in the Ext.panel.Grid  depending on some criteria . I was looking into the API and was trying a way out. However, in the meanwhile when I googled one of the answers on Stackoverflow  yeah here  suggested to use the below eventp  precodegrid.onbeforeedit, functioneditor, e    if e.colIdx  0 ampamp e.record.getstatus  4   return false  codepre  pIt worked  But when I referred back to ExtJS 4.2.0 API  thats what we are using , I didnt find the beforeedit event on Ext.grid.Panel or its parent Ext.panel.Table. The RowEditing plugin had the beforeedit event, but not the Grid. However, the older version 4.1.0 had the event for Ext.panel.Grid  a hrefhttpdocs.sencha.comextjs4.1.0apiExt.grid.Paneleventbeforeedit relnofollowhttpdocs.sencha.comextjs4.1.0apiExt.grid.Paneleventbeforeedita , in fact beforeedit on Ext.panel.Grid was introduced since 4.1.0.p  pSo, its just the question which is bothering me that  Was the event deprecated so soon and still working Or the API for 4.2.0 missed it Or what was the reason that an event not defined in the API of the version am using, is still working  This will help me understand how the API is all documented and if I should rely on older versions for better documentation or whatever.p
