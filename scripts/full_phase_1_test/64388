When user searches for price, the DSL query should be able to find and return the display price, e.g., if user wants to search for commodity with display price between 950 and 1150, he should get both, commodity1 and commodity2, as, for commodity1, the displayPrice is price1 and the price.typeprice1 has value 1000. 2. When user wants to sort commodity by price, the DSL should be able to sort based on the displayPrice for individual commodity.p  pAny help  pointers would be really appreciated.p  pThanks.p  pp  h1Edited, with further details of requirementsh1  pThanks a lot for going through the question and preparing the code. I should have ideally done it. I believe Ive misquoted my question. Let me rephrase the question Ive two requirements from the given datasetp  ul li When user searches for commodity with price range 9501150, the system should first check what is the value for displayPrice and then use this value as a query to find the price object with that price.type. So, e.g., for commodity1, the displayPrice is price1. The corresponding price object under prices with price.typeprice1 has amount as 1000. So, this commodity should be returned. Similarly, for commodity2 has displayPrice as price2. The corresponding price object in commodity2 under prices with price.typeprice2 has amount as 1100. So, this commodity should be returned. li li When user sorts the commodities by price, the value for displayPrice should be picked. The price object having price.type as this value should be used for sorting. So, in commodity1, it should use 1000 against price1 and in commodity2, it should use 1100 against price2. li ul

Positive 64388 pI have job candidates and job listings. I am trying to determine which candidates are qualified for a particular listing. We already have every listing indexed in ES.  The two ways that I see that I could do this arep  ol liIndex every candidate in ES, and then build a query based on the parameters of the listing to searchfilter down on qualified candidates, and return those as results.li liUse the percolate feature to create a percolate query for each candidate, and then find out which candidates match by running the listings data against the candidate percolator index.li ol  pWhich is more efficient and performant at scale millions of records Not fully understanding how the percolator is implemented I havent found any articles that actually explain implementation, my concern is that using the percolator, Id actually be running one query per candidate per listing, which would be very inefficient.p
Negative 64388 pIm currently working on a system which requires many disconnected graphs in a single database.I was having an approach in my mind that,if the nodes are grouped with each group having a label name, each group of nodes and its relationships together acts as an independent graph and I can call in the label name and query correspondingly to traverse through each graphs. Is this in any way possible.p  pExample   label1node1node2node3,label2node4node5node6p  phere label1 and label2 are 2 labels with uniquely defines two graphs inside the same neo4j databasep
