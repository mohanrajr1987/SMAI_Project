Negative 6828 pI have an Access Database 2010 that uses a linked table from a SharePoint 2013 list of names. It does not edit the information on the SharePoint list, but rather pulls the names from SP to populate the name field in the new records in Access. The user then can add in the additional information stored in the Access DB in this case, it is somewhat of a report card form that allows the teacher to input students grades.p  pThis DB is stored on a SharePoint site. When teachers try to use it, they are prompted to save the DB locally and then Save to SharePoint when they are done. The problem is that if two teachers are using it at the same time and one saves to SP after the other, the latter teacher will overwrite all the changes that the former teacher made.p  pIve done some research and it seems that splitting the Access DB might work to allow teachers to simultaneously edit only a maximum of 6 users will be editing at the same time. But I have not tried this method before. Will splitting into frontend and backend affect the linked table of names that is taken from a SharePoint list What is the best way to allow simultaneous editsp
Negative 6828 pIm having a problem with a new file format Im being asked to implement at work.p  pBasically, the file is a text file which contains a bunch of headers containing information about the data in UTC8, and then the rest of the file is the numerical data in binary. I can write the data and read it back just fine, and I recently added the code to write the headers. The problem is that I dont know how to read a file that contains both text and binary data. I want to be able to read in and deal with the header information which is fairly extensive and then be able to continue reading the binary data without having to reiterate through the headers. Is this possiblep  pI am currently using a codeFileInputStreamcode to read the binary data, but I dont know how to start it at the beginning of the data, rather than the beginning of the whole file. One of the codeFileInputStreamcodes constructors takes a codeFileDescriptorcode as the argument and I think thats my answer, but I dont know how to get one from another file reading class.
