Positive 520 pI want to create a program that will stream video from my USB webcam over the internet to a web page.p  pCurrently I use a webservice that when triggered, calls fswebcam to capture an image, save to data store, convert to base64 binary and send that data over to the HTML page where it is rendered into the src attribute of img. The HTML page has JavaScript that calls this service once per second.p  pAs you can tell this is a horrible way to do this. I would rather have a proper stream if I can. But I dont know what technologies are available to achieve this.p  pThe webservice is written in nodejs. The server is running on a raspberry pi 2. I didnt put this question in the raspberry pi forum because I think its a general Linuxprogramming issue. p

Negative 520 pI am trying to upgrade a Wordpress blog to use Amazon SES Simple Email Service with the Subscribe2 email notification plugin see links below.  Currently I have the email working with the SES service, but I am running into rate limiting issues due to the fact that I have more than 1000 subscribers.  I know that the SES service limits BCC emails to 50 recipients so in the Subscribe2 plugin I have truncated the BCC limit to 50 recipients per batch.  However since I am still at the initial sending limits I can only send 1 message up to 50 recipients a piece per second, and since the Subscribe2 plugin doesnt have any sort of throttling mechanism Im looking for the paid Wordpress Mail Queue plugin to slowly send off the emails over a period of time, but Im concerned that the SES plugin and the Mail Queue plugin will conflict each other because I believe they both override the same wpmail function you can only override this once.  I may be mistaken, but does anyone have any insight into thisp  pSubscribe2 Plugin  a hrefhttpsubscribe2.wordpress.com relnofollowhttpsubscribe2.wordpress.comap  pAmazon SES Plugin  a hrefhttpwordpress.orgextendpluginsamazonsesanddkimmailer relnofollowhttpwordpress.orgextendpluginsamazonsesanddkimmailerap  pAlternative SES Plugin  a hrefhttpwordpress.orgextendpluginswpses relnofollowhttpwordpress.orgextendpluginswpsesap  pWordpress Mail Queue Plugin  a hrefhttpwpplugins.complugin76wordpressmailqueuewpmq relnofollowhttpwpplugins.complugin76wordpressmailqueuewpmqap
