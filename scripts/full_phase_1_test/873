Positive 873 pLanguage VB.Net but any insight into the logic would help Q  I cant quite get the logic right to solve this. The user interface is a simple textbox1 and Submit button. On entering a wrong password it outputs the message Access Denied four times the number of elements in the array and if pass2 is entered, it would output Access Denied and then Access Granted. pass3 would output 2 lots of Access Denied before a third Access Granted.

Negative 873 pstrongProblemstrong Suppose you have a collection of points in the 2D plane. I want to know if this set of points sits on a regular grid if they are a subset of a 2D lattice. I would like some ideas on how to do this.p  pFor now, lets say Im only interested in whether these points form an axisaligned rectangular grid that the underlying lattice is rectangular, aligned with the x and y axes, and that it is a complete rectangle the subset of the lattice has a rectangular boundary with no holes. Any solutions must be quite efficient better than ON2, since N can be hundreds of thousands or millions.p  pstrongContextstrong I wrote a 2D vector field plot generator which works for an arbitrarily sampled vector field. In the case that the sampling is on a regular grid, there are simplermore efficient interpolation schemes for generating the plot, and I would like to know when I can use this special case. The special case is sufficiently better that it merits doing. The program is written in C.p
Negative 873 pIm learning Corona SDK and am new to lua as well i mainly do ruby and some javascript.p  pI have a bar that i want to fill up as the user does stuff.  Ive set it up as followsp  precode            outer rectangle     powerBar  display.newRect210, 6, 24, 9     powerBar.strokeWidth  1     powerBarsetStrokeColor254,203,50      powerBarsetFillColor0,0,0,0                inner rectangle which fills up     powerBarFill  display.newRect211,7,0,7     powerBarFillsetFillColor234,183,30        codepre  pWhen the stuff happens, i add 1 to powerBarFill.width, which i thought would make it grow from left to right.  But, its actually growing out from the centre, ie its x is in the centre and the width extends either side from that.  p  pWhats the best way to keep the left side static and grow the right side  Can i set it so that its x position is actually on the left hand side rather than in the middle  Seems like that might do it.p  pcheers in advancep

Negative 873 pI need to archive all compile, test, runtime dependency jars for my android project that is based on gradle and Android studio.p  pI use the following task to dump my dependencies sorry I cant remember the stackoverflow post to cite herep  precodetask showMeCache ltlt      configurations.androidTestCompile.each  println it      configurations.compile.each  println it   codepre  pThe dependencies seem to be in two placesp  ul liapplibli li.gradlecachesmodules2files2.1li ul  pIn addition to archiving my dependencies I would like to tweek my build process to use my archived dependencies first before looking elsewhere.
