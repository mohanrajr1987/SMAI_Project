Negative 5881 pI am new to this concept of DI, and IoC so i might be doing this completely wrong but i am trying to inject the Model that matches a controller into that controllers constructor UserModel  UsersController so that i can mock it later on. p  pSo my model looks likep  precodeuse IlluminateAuthUserInterface  class User extends Eloquent implements UserInterface        public function getAuthIdentifier              return thisgtgetKey            public function getAuthPassword              return thisgtpassword        codepre  pAnd i am then trying to inject in UsersController like so p  precodeclass UsersController extends Controller       protected user      public function constructUser user              thisgtuser  user           public function index              dd thisgtuser         users  thisgtusergtall         foreach  users as user               printruser         return        codepre  pThen when i hit this controller in the browser i get a Unresolvable dependency resolving error. p  pI noticed that this happend only when the class that i am trying to inject is a sub class of eloquent, if i try the same code with a custom class that do not extend eloquent then it works fine. p  pAm i missing somethingp
Negative 5881 pI have a flex app hosted on a windows server running IIS. That same server has some rest services that the app interacts with.  The rest services have windows authentication so that their urls cannot be called without credentials.  The flex app needs to be accessible to the public so its files are accessed by enabling anonymous access.  The problem is of course that when the app tries to call the rest services the browser pops a dialog box asking for windows username and pass.  I naively hoped that if I set the anonymous access on the flex site to use the credentials of a windows account that had permission to view the rest services that would resolve the matter.  I hoped that IIS would see the browser used the proper creds to view the flex app and use those same creds to get the rest services.  Wrong, that didnt work.p  pSo is what I want impossible  Id like to find a way to not force the user to enter windows creds, keep the rest services using windows authentication, and have the flex app able to access the rest urls.  Any ideas  Am I missing something  Also, it may turn out that the flex app is running on http and the rest services must be called with https.  Does that change your answer  Any thoughts much appreciated.p
Negative 5881 pJust stumbled upon this in wikipediap  blockquote   pJava can access derived instance methods faster than C can access   derived virtual methods due to Cs extra VirtualTable lookup.   However, nonvirtual methods in C do not suffer from VTable   performance bottlenecks, and thus exhibit performance similar to that   of Java.p blockquote  pIs this correct As far as I know, ALL calls are virtual in Java, and still rely on a virtual table, so my common logic suggests that Java calls cannot possibly be faster than virtual C calls.p  pAm I misinformed or is the article wrong At any rate  is there a FASTER way of resolving calls at runtime than a virtual tablep

Negative 5881 pHere is my situation.  I have a strongconfig.phpstrong file that I would like to share between all of my folders.
