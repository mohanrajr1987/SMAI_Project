Positive 80825 pI am rewriting a web application in VS 2012 Pro.  The old application was done in VS 2008 and used several Typed DataSets for db interaction.  I have copied the typed dataset files .xsd, .cs, .xsc, .xss, .Designer.cs, etc from the old project to the new.  The new web app solution is comprised of 5 projects, all targeting .NET Framework 3.5. I am using a different SQL Server instance my local test db server than the original, but the db itself was restored from a backup of the production db.  Also, the prod db is SQL Server 2008 Express, my local is SQL Server 2012 Express.p  pI can, with no issues, use the existing typed datasets to retrieve and save data hitting my test db.  And btw, the old app used these DataConnection files .cs and .resx, which I also copied into the new web application to enable usage of the typed datasets.  I did need to change the connection strings of course.p  pThe trouble I am having is that I have added new columns to one of the tables in my test db, but I am unable to update the Typed DataSets to make them aware of the new columns.  p  pI am new to Typed DataSets, and after a couple days research I have learned that you would normally create a data connection thru server explorer then drag tables from your db onto a Typed DataSet surface.  Also, I have read that you can refresh or configure the Typed DataSet to make it aware of new columns.  I am unable to do that with these existing copied in datasets when I doubleclick on an .xsd, and rightclick, the menu that pops up has configure disabled.p  pI have even created a new solution, setup all of my projects, and recreated from scratch the data connection and Typed DataSets, but lots of other things break.p  pIn my last working solution, I added a data connection in server explorer to my local test SQL Server db, but it did not help, which may be due to the fact that it is not the same db server as what was used when the original Typed DataSets were created  To validate this idea I looked thru all of the files for one of the Typed DataSets but found nothing that points to a data connection, so I am unsure if that is in fact an issue.p  pSo, my question is, how can I update an existing Typed DataSet that I copied into a new project  It is interesting that I can used them as is, but cannot update them.  My guess is that there is a disconnect between the Typed DataSets and the db itselfp  pThxp
Positive 80825 pIve read and read and read for days, and I give up. There are articles that tell you how to do this  almost. Either how to rename a specific results file, or for testing within MSBuild TONS of these, or changing the ROOT of the file placement folder structure. Those answers are not helpful. Im testing directly in VS 2012. [SadFace] Google was not my friend this time.p  pOn our test machines, VS 2012 creates test output files at the bottom of a long folder structure. It looks like this including the filesp  precode    ltsolutionFoldergt       TestResults         ltTestNameFrom.testSettingsFileWithDateAndTimegt           In             ltGuidForThisTestRungt               ltmachineNamegt                 RecordedMedia.trmx                 ScreenCapture.wmv                 UITestActionLog.html codepre  pThis file structure is not only unreasonable as there is no correlation between a test and its folder it is also hard to navigate. And theres NOTHING in any of the folders from TestResults on down until the machine name folder. That means we have to navigate three extra folders EVERY TIME we need to look through the test results or forward them to the developers assuming we can figure out which to look in.p  pIf there are multiple tests in the run, there will be multiple GUIDs in the In folder, with a folder named machinename in that, and the test result files in the machine name folder. For example including the filesp  precode    RegressionTesting       TestResults         WebRegressionTests 20150923 142720           In             36fe25817e14c3d0b0fa1956665ab20d               DEV0282C                 RecordedMedia.trmx                 ScreenCapture.wmv                 UITestActionLog.html             e3448182eb471840cbdeca5bd5660270               DEV0282C                 RecordedMedia.trmx                 ScreenCapture.wmv                 UITestActionLog.html             ed71d0f34fc542ab96e3b68efecdf4d8               DEV0282C                 RecordedMedia.trmx                 ScreenCapture.wmv                 UITestActionLog.html codepre  pTheres also an Out folder, a sibling to In, but its always empty.p  pWhat Id like is to specify the folder structure myself, to include beside the date and time the test case name and number from Microsoft Test Manager, but to EXCLUDE those three empty, unused, useless folder layers.
