Positive 23577 pHow can I draw a long text string in a rect with tail truncation I tried to use drawInRectwithAttributes with NSLineBreakByTruncatingTail paragraph style, but it always renders text on a single line. It only renders multiline text with NSLineBreakByWordWrapping and NSLineBreakByCharWrapping break modes and when using this option there is no truncation. Is there any property that I need to set on the paragraph style in order to make this happen Or is this simply no longer supported, in which case I can see no alternative other than continuing to use deprecated methods. The deprecated method drawInRectwithFontlineBreakModealignmentworked correctly.p
