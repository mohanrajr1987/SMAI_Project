Positive 34305 pIve an application which has a database in SQL server 2012 and the application use entity framework to communicate with database. In the application, there is a functionality to update a record in a table based on a WHERE condition and the Primary Key field is the one used in the WHERE condition. So the update happens only to a single record there is no loop or anything just an update to a single record. This is the background.p  pHere is the issue now Im facing  Im getting a timeout error message from the application when I invoke the functionality to update a record in the table as mentioned above. I checked the query execution in the SQL server using Activity Monitor and under the Processes tab I could see that the Command of this query comes to KILLEDROLLBACK after some Wait Types like LOGBUFFER, pageiolatchXX, etc...p  pI tried to execute the update query directly in SQL server and that also not responding. So its clear the issues is with the SQL server and it takes too much time to execute the update query. But the execution plan looks good and the PK field is used as the where condition.
