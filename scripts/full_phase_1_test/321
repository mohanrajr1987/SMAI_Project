Positive 321 pI am running server program on 32 GB machine. RSS goes up and free memory keeps getting lower. Eventually when free memory reaches 400 MB, it does not goes down. At some point application needs some large memory say few gb and it dies. We are using jemalloc. I suspect jemalloc caching dirty pages. My questions are  1. How to display dirty memory setting in running process.  2. How to change dirty page that jemalloc can have.  P.S. We have ran valgrind to verify no memory leak under test run. Application is in C and multithreaded. Also surprised why stackoverflow does not have jemalloc tag p

Positive 321 pApologies if this emseemsem like a duplicate question but Id like some clarification on a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions14768230mallocforstructandpointerinca previous question I found herea regarding allocating heap memory using malloc for a struct containing a pointer.

Unfortunately it doesnt go into codemalloccode in much detail. I then came across the following code on page 119 which is illustrating an example of how symbol table management e.g. for the preprocessor might work. It defines a struct nlist for a symbol and the text to replace the symbol with. nlists are stored in a static array hashtab, using a simple hash function then a modulo array size of the hash to calculate the array index, so there is a pointer to the next nlist if there is a collisionp  precodestruct nlist   table entry       struct nlist next  next entry in chain       char name  defined name       char defn  replacement text    codepre  pThere is then an install function which is used to add a new nlist to hashtabp  precodestruct nlist lookupchar  char strdupchar    install put name, defn in hashtab   struct nlist installchar name, char defn        struct nlist np      unsigned hashval      if np  lookupname  NULL   not found              np  struct nlist  mallocsizeofnp          if np  NULL  npgtname  strdupname  NULL             return NULL          hashval  hashname          npgtnext  hashtab[hashval]          hashtab[hashval]  np       else  already there          freevoid  npgtdefn free previous defn      if npgtdefn  strdupdefn  NULL         return NULL      return np   codepre  pThis is the point at which I started to weep and rock backwards and forwards, drooling as my brain melted out of my ears.

Positive 321 pI am currently learning C and want to write a program that reads a line of numbers from a file, seperated by spaces for example 43 2 6 120 5 23, and then stores those numbers in a dynamic array. My idea so far is to read the line as a string, seperate it into tokens emstrtokem, then convert those tokens to int numbers ematoiem and store those. My problem is that I have to allocate memory using emmallocem, but cant tell the program how much memory is needed manually, because it has to be able to work with lines of any length and numbers of any size, and I dont know how to do that. I am emnotem supposed to use emreallocem.p  pI dont want anyone to do my work for me, just a simple example andor good explanation of a way to do what I want would be really helpful. If anymore information is needed, Ill give it to you. I know that there are some questions on this topic on here and I have looked at them, I just have a hard time understanding some things without having them explained, since Im completely new to C programming. Of course, if anyone can give me a link that might help me, that would be great as well.p
Negative 321 pfirst of all, considering that im not a pure programmer but a graphic designer and in addition  not Englishspeaking, so dont be shocked if you see something extremely wrong  Well, I need to load an iframe and change some of the css contents, just clicking on a link.

But when I click on the second link load2 that basically load a different page, the new page newindex.html will load but without css injection and scroll to anchor... the injection and scroll occurs only when I click again to the load2 link. This happen, i suppose, because the iframe needs to preload with the right page before the anchor and css will operate. Do someone have a solution thanksp

Every product has title, URL address, description, image,...p  pEvery product can be published at one or more of these websites for example Store 1, Store 2, Store 3. I need to save it into one common database table because of the store, orders and easier administration but the products attributes can differ from one store to another. It means the product with ID 1 can be named like Product A at Store 1, Product B at Store 2 and Product C at Store 3. There could be SEO or translation reasons.p  pI need to search the product and its variants by its URL address.p  pNow I am considering the best way to make it.p  p1 Hstore data type in PostgreSQL. This is great function but when I think about it more and more I am not sure if its the best solution and there is no problem with it in the future development. The biggest con is that you have to use native query language when you want to find an item by value. It makes often bugs on developer side. And the second one is necessity of using PostgreSQL and impossible migration to another database MySQL, MariaDB,..p  p2 Json data type in PostgreSQL. I think is almost the same situation like hstore and there is no big difference.p  p3 Using joined table for translations. Probablby Gedmo Doctrine Extensions. I am afraid of high number of SQL queries and demands for this solution. There could be tens of thousands of products and hundreds of thousands of its variants. When I join 2 tables with 100k items and search by url it can be quite slowly. This is the biggest problem I think about.p  pI prefer hstore but I am afraid of possible problems because this is step in the dark for me. And I am not sure with translations because of load despite we plan to use own server for the system.p  pI will be really grateful you for tips and experiences.p
