Positive 220 pIm attempting to implement a stronger password hashingstorage mechanism and opting for the simplest approach, PHPs a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenfunction.passwordhash.php relnofollowpasswordhasha and a hrefhttpphp.netmanualenfunction.passwordverify.php relnofollowpasswordverifya.p  pIm letting PHP generate a random salt as recommended, and this all makes sense. Except, part of the strong password policy I need to implement is to reject a user from reusing a previously used password. In theory, I would be able to implement this by storing an archive of hashed passwords. When the user changes hisher password, we check the new hash against the archive of hashes. If theres a match, we know that the password has been previously used and reject it. However, implementing a random salt, while significantly more secure, effectively makes this archive of password hashes useless.p  pSo, my question is how to implement this password policy while using random salts Surely somebody else has run across this problem.p
Positive 220 pI am introducing Spring Security in an existing application. Currently db has MD5 encoded passwords which we want to migrate to bcrypt. Since we have a large number of users initially we would like to support both MD5 and bcrypt together. We have thought off having a table which will store how many users are migrated to bcrypt once we have every one migrated we will stop supporting MD5.p  pSo I thought of extending the strongBCryptPasswordEncoderstrong class of SpringSecurity and do the things inside matches method. So I have below class,p  precodeimport org.springframework.security.crypto.bcrypt.BCryptPasswordEncoder  public class CustomPasswordEncoder extends BCryptPasswordEncoder       Override     public boolean matchesCharSequence rawPassword, String encodedPassword          if rawPassword  null  encodedPassword  null              return false                   if super.matchesrawPassword, encodedPassword   This is not BCrypt password try OLD password encoding instead             boolean isOldPasswordMatched  rawPassword.equalsSHA1.getSHA1HashencodedPassword             ifisOldPasswordMatched                 migrateToBCryptuserName  error here, encoderawPassword                          return isOldPasswordMatched                  return true           private boolean migrateToBCryptString userName, String newBcryptPassword         update password in database          Insert to migrated table         return true        codepre  pHowever my problem is I dont get username inside this function to do the migration, strongHow can I get username inside matches of password encoder  Am I doing something wrong here  What could be the best approach in this situation strongp

That is I wish to create a vector with N elements of, say, codeint[5]code.p  pCan I be certain that all N5 integers are now contiguous in memory So that I in principle could access all of the integers simply by knowing the address of the first element Is this implementation dependentp  pFor reference the way I currently create a 2D array in a contiguous memory block is by first making a dynamic array of float of length N, allocating all N5 floats in one array and then copying the address of every 5th element into the first array of codefloatcode. p
Negative 220 pIm trying to build a thumbnail stripe  I want to add images of 30x30 to the stripe dynamically as they are being lazy download from the source on the web.p  pFor some reason, the images are being painted on the wrong width. I see them stretch on the whole stripe instead of staying 30x30... p  pI want the thumbnail stripe to be in the height of 40, and the width of 40xNumofthumbnails.p  pAfter each image is downloaded, I resize it to 30x30, and then I call thisp  precode UIImage  addThumbImageUIImage thumb toStripeUIImage stripe atIndexNSIntegerindex       CGSize size  CGSizeMakeindex40, 40     ifUIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions  NULL       UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptionssize, NO,  [ UIScreen mainScreen ].scale  else      UIGraphicsBeginImageContextsize        first, drawing the stripe we got till now     CGPoint stripePoint  CGPointMake0, 0     [stripe drawAtPointstripePoint]      now adding the new thumbnail     CGPoint thumbPoint  CGPointMakeindex1405, 5     NSUInteger locX  index1405     CGRect newRect  CGRectMakelocX, 5, 30, 30     [thumb drawInRectnewRect]      UIImage result  UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext     UIGraphicsEndImageContext      return result   codepre  ul liI know that my images are correctly resized to 30x30 before I send them to that functionli liI guess the problem is with the drawInRect somewhere... it draws it on the whole Image context.li ul  pEDIT some more clarifications the stripe is used to show thumbnails of photos in my app. It suppose to look a bit similar to what you can see in ipads photos app. The reason I need to build it on the fly is because I have an unknown number of photos  it depends on something that is going on in the server side. Photos can be added or removed, so I need the stripe to be dynamic. Upon addremove photo in the server, I will update the stripe in the app accordingly.  I edited the code to include UIGraphic..withOptions and withoutOptions, and to add the right scale. p

Negative 220 pI am using colorbox which I have used many times for different clients, but it is not working this time and I can not figure out why. I am trying to open a video on YouTube, and then open up some inline HTML, Ive copied the code from the examples just as I always do, and replaced what needs to be replaced. There are parts of the script that are missing when I look at the source code from the browser. The website is a hrefhttpwww.powerhousebowling.com relnofollowhttpwww.powerhousebowling.coma. Maybe Im missing something.p  pIn my backend it looks like thisp  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     document.readyfunction     .youtube.colorboxiframetrue, innerWidth425, innerHeight344     .opencolorbox.colorboxwidth50, inlinetrue, hrefinlinetext      ltscriptgt codepre  pBut when I look at the source code in FF or IE it shows...p  precodeltscript typetextjavascriptgt     document.readyfunction         .youtube.colorbox         .opencolorbox.colorbox      ltscriptgt codepre
