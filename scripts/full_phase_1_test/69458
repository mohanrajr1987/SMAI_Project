Positive 69458 pNote the following question is about a Intel based full Windows 8 tablet for which the drivers work perfectly for regular Windows Desktop i. e.  nonMetro applications.p  pFor Metro applications,  theres the generic WinUSB support,  but Im unsure what is needed to use the widely used FTDI driver and f2dx.dll user space handler.  Due to the fact that the FTDI chips dont support direct endpoint based communication,  but instead impose some additional custom protocol,  I cannot simply use the endpoint based WinUSB driver.  Would switching to the CDC mode of FTDI work with Metro essentially,  this causes the device to appear as a serial port  p
Positive 69458 pIm using the codeStore Appcode  codeGrid Appcode template to make an app that reads data from the web and present the data in pages.p  pThe data model Im using is similar to modification of the default codeSampleData.jsoncode and codeSampleDataSource.cscode provided with the template, except that Im reading the data from two sources  one Group from an online xml file and the second Group from a timeintensive function.p  pI want the user to be able to open the first group since it loads quickly while the app loads the second group which as I mentioned, takes time and Im using the following code to achieve thisp  precodeprivate async Task GetGroups    SampleDataGroup group1  new SampleDataGroupinitialization parameters    add items to group1   this.Groups.Addgroup1    LoadGroup2  this async function is not awaited   private async Task LoadGroup2    SampleDataGroup group2  new SampleDataGroupinitialization parameters    spend lots of time adding adding items to group2  this.Groups.Addgroup2  codepre  pThis code works as expected Group 1 is displayed, user can browse through the Group 1 items, 2 minutes pass and then Group 2 is loaded. My problem is that, at times maybe 1 in 5 times, and for no reason that I can see none of the images inside Group 2 i.e. in the codeGridViewcode are loaded, i.e. they show up black. But clicking on any of the Group 2 items does take the user to the corresponding codeItemDetailPage.xamlcode.p  pWhy the apparently random lack of display of all the images in Group2 inside the codeGridViewcode Does it have to do with the asyncawait method Ive used p

Positive 69458 pI have spent over a month now looking for a solution on how to transmit live camera stream from a metro app to a publishing server which I implemented in form of a web socket ashx handler. Apparently, all resources I have found online states that I cannot get access to the live camera frames with c, it was said that this could only be achieved with native C. p  pI wrote a hack to override the WriteAsync method IRandmomAccessStream class in the Windows.Storage.Streams namespace. I believe this method gets called each time a new sequence of bytes is to be written from the recording camera to the stream buffer. I overrode this write method to send those sequence of bytes to the manually created web socket server which worked fine but the video was always corrupted at the receiving end.p  pI believe this is due to some missing metadatafragmented frames as the stream is in h.264. I want to ask if anyone has an idea of a library that can transcode the camera feed in realtime for live streaming in pure c.  p

So If someone can point me out to the correct direction, I would gladly appreciate this contribution.p  pIn a recipe, I want to add an X number, for example, number of lemons, every 16 cups. So when I have 5 cups, I would only use 1 lemon. When I have 17 cups, I would use 2 lemons. When I have 32 cups, I would then add a 3rd lemon, and like that every multiple of 16.p  pWhat could be the easiest way to solve thisp

Negative 69458 pIn iOS 8, Apple has given developers the ability to create custom keyboards. In the a hrefhttpsdeveloper.apple.comlibraryprereleaseiosdocumentationGeneralConceptualExtensibilityPGKeyboard.htmldocumentationa, Apple states that you should create a new keyboard if you want to support a language that iOS does not currently support. Therefore, if you are able to support new languages, are you able to create a keyboard that contains new emoji characters I would assume that by Apple stating that you can support a new language, they would expect there to be custom characters involved. If including custom characters is possible, how would other devices even if only other devices running iOS 8 display the new charactersp

Anyway I am stuck on a problem which I explain below.p  pIn the problem my job is to arrange n wifi routers to minimize the longest distance between any house and the nearest wifi router. I can assume that the houses are arranged in a one dimensional space. I am given the positions of the houses as a distance from an initial point and the positions are given in sorted order. Additionally I must solve this problem in Om log L where m is the number of houses and L is the maximum position that can be given. p  pI have tried to figure this out, but none of the algorithms that I come up with can solve it in the complexity required. Thanks for any hints on how I would go about solving this.p
