Positive 2999 pim new to angularjs and couldnt find an answer to my question anywhere. So, i have a service that gets called into a controller. What i would like to do is to get a particular value from this controller and construct another service url with it.p  pHere is an examplep  precodeangular.modulemyApp    .factoryMyFirstService functionresource     return resource apidataid,  id id,  update  method PUT      .controllermyCtrl, function scope, stateParams, MyFirstService     scope.data  MyFirstService.getid stateParams.id      var dataSpecificValue  scope.data.SpecificValue       .factoryMySecondService, functionresource     var SpecificValue  dataSpecificValue     return resourceapi  SpecificValue  id,  id id,  update  method PUT    codepre  pIt seems that i should inject myCtrl controller into MySecondService factory to retrieve the value of SpecificValue, but it would be a weird practice, nop

Positive 2999 pThe question might seem too vague but I could not think of a better way to describe the idea, so Ill try to explain it in details.p  pI have MasterController attached to codelthtmlgtcode tag of my SPA application. This MasterController contains all the logic and models for controlling the following UI elementsp  ul lipage title codelttitlegtcode tagli lisubheader which displays the title of current page like Customers, Orders, Settings etc.li liname of the currently loggedin userli lisome commonly used action buttons which will be used for all pages in the system. To be specific, these buttons are codeShow filterscode, codeExport data to Excelcode and codeAdd new recordcode.li ul  pWhile the first two items on this list can be managed through detection of current uirouter state through its codestateChangeSuccesscode event, the last two username and buttons are somewhat problematic, especially the buttons.p  pI can manage the button actions using codebroadcastcode, so every controller can be notified about clicks on any button. But the tricky part here is that the buttons might be needed in different combinations  one page might need all of them, and another one might need none. p  pLets say, uirouter loads some CustomersController. At that point MasterController receives codestateChangeSuccesscode event and by default hides all the buttons. p  pstrongBut now, how does CustomersController tell to MasterController that CustomersController will need two specific buttons from the very beginningstrongp  pTheoretically, I could use codeemitcode from CustomersController to send an event to MasterController, but it somehow feels ugly. Events are meant for, well, events and not for sending requests like hey, MasterController, if you are somewhere up the scope, can you please show the following buttons.p  pOf course, I might be wrong and maybe there is some way to use Angular event system to manage this scenario in clean way.p  pWhat came to my mind is that maybe in the codestateChangeSuccesscode event I could somehow detect if there are currently any listeners for my button click events and then I could hide buttons which do not have any listeners attached, but Im not sure how to do it, and Im not sure whether it will work as expected  whether old listeners will be detached when uirouter recreates the view with another controller.p

Negative 2999 pWe recently did a SQL Server upgrade from 2005 to 2012. We have a nightly job that drops a snapshot of an active database. The snapshots gets created again later in the day. Before upgrading, in SQL 2005 the Job that drops the snapshots used to finish in few seconds. But once the server has been upgraded to 2012, the same job takes close to an hour to complete. p  pThe log files for the job contains a message emNonqualified transactions are being rolled back. Estimated rollback completion 0. [SQLSTATE 01000] Message 5060  Nonqualified transactions are being rolled back. Estimated rollback completion 100.em This message is repeated several times. While monitoring the underlying database, we have found some blocking on the database during that time. But if I am correct, a blocking on the underlying database should not delay a statement to drop its snapshot. May I know if I am correct If so, what could be the reasons for this delay after upgrading to 2012 Any missing settings at the server or database level Thanks.p
Negative 2999 pI want to use TIFF images to effectively save large arrays of measurement data. With setting them to modeI16 corresponding to my 16 bit data range, they yield 2MB files 1000x1000 pixel. Which is good.p  pHowever I am having troubles reconverting them into arrays when it comes to analysing them. For 32bit data  I the numpy.array command works fine. In case of I16 the result is a 0D numpy array with the TIFF as the [0,0] entry. p  pIs there a way to get that to work I would really like to avoid using 32bit images, as I dont need the range and it doubles the HDD space required lots and lots of those measurements planned...p

Negative 2999 pWe build Java Spring MVC web apps for internal company users that have pretty basic GUIs.  A few have jQueryAjax to add some GUI richness, but nothing major.  For a new app, the business users are asking for a very rich web app ex drag and drop functionality, flexible tables like in Excel, etc.  Our users can only use IE8 and we cant run Java applets in the browser.  Also we dont have the time to learn an entirely new language ex Flex, so the learning curve cant be too steep for Java MVC developers.  This app will only be used by company internal users  100 concurrent users.p  pI have looked into some of the newer Javascript MVC frameworks ex Spine, Backbone, Ember.  My main concern is that I am not sure how well the resulting complex Javascript will run under IE8.  A secondary concern is that we dont have experience trying to maintain a lot of code in Javascript.  It seems like a lot of Javascript code would become a maintenance nightmare nontypesafe, harder to debug, not as many tools, etc.p  pI have also looked into GWT and ZK.  These frameworks reduce the concern about maintaining a lot of Javascript code, but the IE8 performance concern still remains.  If we built a very rich GUI in one of these frameworks, would the resulting autogenerated Javascript work well in IE8  p  pWhat framework would you recommend that would meet the highlevel user requirements listed above and also meet the nonfunctional requirements small learning curve, low maintenance burden, good future support  Has anyone tried to do something similar to this  If so, what did you use and how did it turn outp

Negative 2999 pI have a requirement to lazyload resources in a concurrent environment.

Still, I will have to take care and document the pattern at every one of my Singletons.

Negative 2999 pthis is my first post here on stackoverflow, so I hope Im doing this the right way.p  pAnyway, Im trying to create a JPanel inside a JFrame and draw a Grid inside that panel. Therefore, Ive overridden the paintComponents method to do that. Ive tried to set the preferredSize as well as the minimumSize of that panel, but no matter what I do, it shows only a 12x12 portion of that panel.p  pHeres my Grid classp  precodepackage gui  import java.awt.Color import java.awt.Dimension import java.awt.Graphics import java.util.Map  import javax.swing.BorderFactory import javax.swing.JPanel  import collections.MapUtils import executor.Robot  public class Grid extends JPanel      private static final long serialVersionUID  1L     private int rs  GUI.ROBOTSIZE      private final int width     private final int height     private final MapltCoord, Colorgt colors      private int rx     private int ry      public Gridint width, int height          this.width  width         this.height  height          colors  MapUtils.hashMap         forint i  0 i lt width i                 forint j  0 j lt height j                 colors.putnew Coordi, j, Color.WHITE          rx  width2         ry  height2         setPreferredSizenew Dimensionwidth  rs, height  rs         setBorderBorderFactory.createLineBorderColor.CYAN           public int getWidth          return width           public int getHeight      return height   public void updateRobot robot      this.rx  width2  robot.getX     this.ry  height2  robot.getY      repaint   Override public void paintComponentGraphics g      super.paintComponentg     forMap.EntryltCoord, Colorgt es  colors.entrySet          g.setColorColor.RED           g.setColores.getValue         Coord c  es.getKey         g.fillRectc.getXrs, c.getYrs, rs, rs           g.setColorColor.BLACK     forint i  0 i lt width i         g.drawLineirs, 0, irs, heightrs     forint i  0 i lt height i         g.drawLine0, irs, widthrs, irs      g.setColorColor.DARKGRAY     g.drawOvalrxrs, ryrs, rs, rs     g.setColorColor.LIGHTGRAY     g.fillOvalrxrs, ryrs, rs, rs   codepre  pAnd this is how it looks like note the 12x12 red square in the top left corner, which should be the grid a hrefhttpimageshack.usaimg818354549409190.png relnofollowhttpimageshack.usaimg818354549409190.pngap  pThe panel itself is resized correctly, but the graphics dont fill it. I dont know, maybe Im overlooking something simple, but right now I dont know what to do. How can I make it paint the whole gridp  pEDIT Ah now I feel stupid. My mistake was to name the getters getWidth and getHeight which were overriding the methods from JComponent. After renaming them it is working perfectly fine.p
