Positive 1531 pAccording to a hrefhttpwww.cis.upenn.edubcpiercesfcurrentMoreCoq.html relnofollowthis coursea, all constructors for inductive types are injective and disjointp  blockquote   p...Similar principles apply to all inductively defined types all   constructors are injective, and the values built from distinct   constructors are never equal.

Positive 1531 pI am working on a wpf application using Visual Basic and I want to make use of the inherit function to create my custom classes.
