Negative 42922 pIm looking for a means to handle separate but related NSURLRequest and thought that I could add them to an NSOperationQueue and then manage them run the request or not based on http status code  if the status code is 200 they can run, if not, stop all of them as the url string needs to be appended.p  pIn my test code below I suspend the OQ to stop the processing of NSURLRequest represented here by some public RSS feeds but continue to the request to the OQ. I get the right number of operations 4. After adding all request to the OQ I then check to see if it has been suspended and if so, cancel all the operations.That works, at least the check if it has been suspended. p  pWhen I do a count check after canceling the operations I still get 4 but was expecting less and hoping for 0. Im using NSURLConnection to get the rss data in a NSObject subclass. p  pI understand from the docs that NSOQ will not remove an operation until it has reported that it is finished. Is there a way to see this report  emYou cannot directly remove an operation from a queue after it has been added. An operation remains in its queue until it reports that it is finished with its task. Finishing its task does not necessarily mean that the operation performed that task to completion. An operation can also be canceled. Canceling an operation object leaves the object in the queue but notifies the object that it should abort its task as quickly as possible.emp  pNSURLConnection doesnt have a willStart or similar delegate method so I cant track that but my feeling is the second RSS feed is in some sort of start process and that would explain why it is still in there. But I log the connectionDidFinishLoading delegate and so the first task is completed, so I was expecting at least that to be gone. p  pSo my question is twofold. 1. If I nil out NSOQ, does that eliminate the operations within it And what danger is there if one of those operations is in process  crash, hanging the app, etc 2. Is there a way to cancel a NSURLConnection that is in process Assuming that the answer to 1 is yes, you are in the danger zone. p  pHeres my codep  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      connectionManager myConnectionManager  [[connectionManager alloc] init]     NSOperationQueue operationQueue  [[NSOperationQueue alloc] init]      NSMutableArray arrAddedOperations  [[NSMutableArray alloc] init]       NSArray arrFeeds  [[NSArray alloc] initWithObjectshttprss.cnn.comrsscnntopstories.rss, httphosted.ap.orglineupsUSHEADSrss2.0.xmlSITERANDOMampSECTIONHOME,  httpfeeds.reuters.comreuterstopNews, httpnewsrss.bbc.co.ukrssnewsonlineworldeditionamericasrss.xml, nil]      add operations to operation queue     forint i0 iltarrFeeds.count i           NSInvocationOperation rssOperation  [[NSInvocationOperation alloc]                                                initWithTarget myConnectionManager                                                selectorselectorrunConnection                                                object[arrFeeds objectAtIndexi]]          check to put a suspension on the OQ         if igt1              operationQueue.suspended  YES                   [operationQueue addOperationrssOperation]         [arrAddedOperations addObject[arrFeeds objectAtIndexi]]          incremental count to see operations being added to the queue  should be 4         NSLogThis is the number of operations added to the queuei, [operationQueue operationCount]             if operationQueue.suspended           restart the OQ so we can cancel all the operations         operationQueue.suspended  NO          kill all the operations         [operationQueue cancelAllOperations]          count to see how many operations are left         NSLogOQ has been suspended and operations canclled.
