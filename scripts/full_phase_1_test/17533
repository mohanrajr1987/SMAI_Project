The dotted line below is a UIImageView which is also pinned to both sides and then to title above it. It is also set to a height of 1. no complaints so far. p  pThe content label is where I seem to have the issue. I have pinned the content label to both sides and to the image view above it.

Positive 17533 pBasically, I dropped a Navigation Controller, added 3 rows to the RootViews TableView, set a segue from the first row to a ViewController The detail view. Now I want to start my app at this detail view. I tried to set the initial view as the detail view, but it didnt worked. Latter I tried to trigger the segue, but I could not get it to work, and that solution seemed hacky, I decided to ask you people what would be the correct approach.p  pThanks in advance for any replyp

Positive 17533 pI have a core view class that does much of the logic for more than one View Controller.  Originally to wire this up, I assigned the class to the view controller.  Later, however, I changed the class for the view controller to a different class actually a subclass of the core class that had some custom features just for it.p  pNow I want to add another property to more than one view controller.  The logical place to put the property is in the core class.  However, Im reluctant to rename the class for the View Controller as I dont want to mess up all the other links that are currently there.p  pIs there a way to wire up a View Controller label to a property in a class that is not the current class for that View Controller p  pThanks for any suggestions.p
