Positive 294 pIn my configuration, I need my RPis to get a static IP at boot time. Of course no problem setting a static IP by hand. My problem is that I want to be able to define the IP address in a text file which is accessible on the boot partition.p  pWhen opening any Pi SD card on a windows machine, one can see some files. These files, when booting on the Pi are accessible in the boot folder.p  pThe idea is to have a text file in that folder with the IP address wanted. I can set the IP using any windows text editor. When booting on SD card, the RPi opens the text file and assigns the IP to the device.p  pWhat I tried so farp  ul liusing ifconfig in rc.local file to redefine the current IP of eth0. This works well but not all the time. And this supposes eth0 is already up, which supposes in turn that the IP has been already defined, for example through dhcp.li liusing ifconfig in if.upd script to do the same as above. Doesnt work all the time either. I suspect the script is called over and over again because each time I change the IP using ifconfig, the ifup.d is triggered.li ul  pWhat I actually needp  ul liwhen RPi boots, and embeforeem it loads the ethernet drivers, a script must read the content of a text file in boot and assign the RPis IP address based on the content of that file.li ul  pFinally, my application needs to run headless, so no screen, no login. Anybody has a good advice p  pThank you. p

Positive 294 pIn my database, the address range is stored in a single column, using the IPCIDR notation.  This value contains the start and end IP addresses, but they need to be extracted, into the broadcast and network fields.  The start and end IP addresses are stored as a number.One of the post i read mentioned , IP is converted to an IP number using MySQLs native inetaton function, and back to a dotted IP address using the inetntoa function.So storing the addresses as numbers makes it more efficient to query the database.p  pAs per my understanding using the IP and CIDR, its possible to calculate the broadcast address. codeThe broadcast address is the network IP, plus,32 minus the CIDR,to the power of 2, minus 1code.p  pSo, I ran the following SQL update to populate the two columns.p  precodeUPDATE blocks SET  broadcast  INETATONSUBSTRINGINDEXnetworkcidr, , 1  POW2, 32SUBSTRnetworkcidr, INSTRnetworkcidr, 11,  network  INETATONSUBSTRINGINDEXnetworkcidr, , 1 codepre  pbut this is not working for me.
