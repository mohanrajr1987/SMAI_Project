Positive 802 pWe have a huge repository which contains some very old commits that contain huge binary files.

Positive 802 pWhen doing a normal merge, you always merge one branch into another. The branch that is merged into changes, while the branch being merged from does not change. p  pNow, when I have a longlived feature branch, I sometimes want to merge feature into master, but at the same time get all changes that have happened in master in the meantime into feature as well.p  pI could do two separate merges, but that feels messy. Is there a standard way to achieve what I want Maybe just having the feature branch point to the merge commit by changing what that branch is pointing to Id like to know for both git and mercurial p
