Positive 67618 pIm working on updating a mobile website that was built using ASP.NET MVC2 to mimic some functionality of a nonmobile website that was built using traditional ASP.NET forms. This is my first time working in MVC. Ive read several before me asking about how to overcome the loss of ViewState, and I get the idea of MVC and why it is stateless, but Im not sure exactly how to manage instances that required statefulness in the original site. p  pFor instance, I have a view that requires a web service to be called to load a collection of payment plans. The payment plans are loaded and displayed to the user. When the user selects a payment plan, the form will post and I need to do some calculations based on the properties of the selected payment plan and possibly properties of the other payment plans. But, of course, they no longer exist. Options and problems as I see itp  ul listrongCall the web service to retrieve the payment plans againstrong ul listrongProblem 1strong This is less efficient. It puts more load on the server than when the payment plans were simply stored in ViewState. The calculation of payment plans is lengthy and deseralizing them vs completely recalculating them was ideal in regards to speed.li listrongProblem 2strong The server state may have changed since the payment plans that were presented to the user were generated. Calling the same method to generate them again may give a different result, but the payment plans that were presented to the user should be honored.li ulli listrongStore the payment plans in a hidden field.strong ul listrongProblem 1strong This would allow me to recreate the list of payment plans after the form submits, pretty much like ViewState, except ViewState takes measures I think a hash to ensure it is not tampered with. I cant have a websavvy user going and changing all my prices to 0 in their browser then posting the form. I suppose I could also do a hash, but I get the impression this is not the approach meant to be taken with MVC. li ulli listrongStore the payment plans in Session statestrong ul liI could...we are already dependent on Session and will already need to implement SQL based session to allow scalability. But having a view and action requiring Session state seems wrong and does not seem to follow the advice Ive found on this topic embrace the stateless nature of the web, HTTP, and MVC.li ulli ul  pI dont, at all, love ViewState or traditional ASP.NET and so far really like MVC but am just not yet sure how to handle this type of thing. Thanks in advance.p  pTo try avoid my question being construed as being to broad, the question is When state is necessary, as it seems to be here, how do you store it with MVC2p
