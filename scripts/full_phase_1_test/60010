Negative 60010 pI am currently working on my own version of a glossary written in Java. Truthfully, this is of academic nature and I was hoping someone could point me in the first direction. Anyway, I am reading in text from a text file and putting the words and their corresponding definitions into a Map Tree Map to be more specific. Everything works good from there. Everything is in the map as it should be.p  pNow I start to get to the part where I want to go into HTML and output the contents of the map. I know how to do that with iterators and that wasnt much of a problem. However, when I try to display the content mixed in with HTML I dont get all that I want.
