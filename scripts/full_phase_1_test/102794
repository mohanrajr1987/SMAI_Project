Negative 102794 pOkay so Im developing an app for the chrome cast on IOS. One of the functions my app will perform will be to play local videos from your device. To do this Im using an external source found on github called a hrefhttpsgithub.comrobbiehansonCocoaHTTPServer relnofollowCocoaHttpServer.a This Http server allows me to upload files to a localhost service. To do this i use the following code to start my serverp  precode voidviewDidLoad      [super viewDidLoad]      Do any additional setup after loading the view from its nib.          Configure our logging framework.      To keep things simple and fast, were just going to log to the Xcode console.     [DDLog addLogger[DDTTYLogger sharedInstance]]       Create server using our custom MyHTTPServer class     httpServer  [[HTTPServer alloc] init]        Tell the server to broadcast its presence via Bonjour.      This allows browsers such as Safari to automatically discover our service.     [httpServer setTypehttp.tcp.]       Normally theres no need to run our server on any specific port.      Technologies like Bonjour allow clients to dynamically discover the servers port at runtime.      However, for easy testing you may want force a certain port so you can just hit the refresh button.      [httpServer setPort12345]       Serve files from our embedded Web folder     NSString webPath  [[[NSBundle mainBundle] resourcePath] stringByAppendingPathComponentWeb]     DDLogInfoSetting document root , webPath      [httpServer setDocumentRootwebPath]     [self startServer]      gblvb  [GlobalVariables singleobj]      self.mediaControlChannel  [[GCKMediaControlChannel alloc] init]     self.mediaControlChannel.delegate  self     [gblvb.deviceManager addChannelself.mediaControlChannel]     [self.mediaControlChannel requestStatus]  codepre  pThis code then sets up my http server and points it to look in the web folder which is imported into my main bundle and contains a test video i download from google for testing purposesthis video google use in their sample of streaming to the chrome cast through the web. I got this video from a hrefhttpcommondatastorage.googleapis.comgtvvideosbucketsampleBigBuckBunny.mp4 relnofollowhttpcommondatastorage.googleapis.comgtvvideosbucketsampleBigBuckBunny.mp4a. As well as this the code also sets up a new media channel ready for the chrome cast to cast to...p  pNext I have my void function codestartServercode which really establishes the connection and publishes the server...p  precode voidstartServer       Start the server and check for problems      NSError error     if[httpServer startamperror]              DDLogInfoStarted HTTP Server on port hu, [httpServer listeningPort]           else              DDLogErrorError starting HTTP Server , error       codepre  pLastly the code bellow sets the path to equal the localhost url and acctuallly  cast the video to the chrome castp  precodevoidviewDidAppearBOOLanimated  path  [NSString stringWithFormatlocalhosthu, [httpServer listeningPort], , BigBuckBunny.mp4]        Do any additional setup after loading the view from its nib.      gblvb  [ GlobalVariables singleobj]       deviceScanner  [[GCKDeviceScanner alloc] init]       [deviceScanner addListenerself]     [deviceScanner startScan]     NSString image     NSString type     GCKMediaMetadata metadata  [[GCKMediaMetadata alloc] init]           image  FolderVideoicon.png          [metadata setStringThe MP4 file format defined some extensions over the ISO Base Media File Format to support MPEG4 visualaudio codecs and various MPEG4 Systems features such as object descriptors and scene descriptions.                      forKeykGCKMetadataKeySubtitle]         type  videomp4 [metadata setString[NSString stringWithFormat, Casting  , gblvb.FileType]forKeykGCKMetadataKeyTitle]        [metadata addImage[[GCKImage alloc]                         initWithURL[[NSURL alloc] initWithStringimage]                         width480                         height360]]      define Media information     sleep2     GCKMediaInformation mediaInformation      [[GCKMediaInformation alloc] initWithContentIDpath                                         streamTypeGCKMediaStreamTypeNone                                        contentTypetype                                           metadatametadata                                     streamDuration0                                         customDatanil]      cast video     [mediaControlChannel loadMediamediaInformation autoplayTRUE playPosition0]     NSLogFull Path  , path  codepre  pNow my problem is that when this http server is published and ready to cast the chrome cast does not play it even though when i actually navigate to the path on safari the video displays perfectly. As well as this i know that the chrome cast streams fine due to the fact it streams googles online example video just fine.p  pstrongEDITstrong Here is my debugging log form the chrome castp  precodeFailed to load resource the server responded with a status of 404 Not Found httpswww.gstatic.comeurekaplayerundefined  [  0.259s] [goog.net.WebSocket] Opening the WebSocket on wslocalhost8008v2ipc  castreceiver.js18  [  0.580s] [goog.net.WebSocket] WebSocket opened on wslocalhost8008v2ipc  castreceiver.js18 GET httpswww.gstatic.comeurekaplayerFolderVideoicon.png 404 Not Found player.js31 The page at httpswww.gstatic.comeurekaplayerplayer.htmlskin was loaded over HTTPS, but displayed insecure content from httplocalhost49598BigBuckBunny.mp4 this content should also be loaded over HTTPS.  castreceiver.js69 GET httplocalhost49598BigBuckBunny.mp4  castreceiver.js69  [ 21.834s] [cast.receiver.MediaManager] Load metadata error  castreceiver.js18 GET httpswww.gstatic.comeurekaplayerFolderVideoicon.png 404 Not Found  codepre  pAny Help will be appreciated.p
