Positive 14948 pI answered a question about testing to see if a date was in the same, previous, or even earlier week compared to a reference date.p  pIn this case the question was about testing to see if the earlier date was less than 5, less than 10 or 10 or more working days before the reference date, and referred to a previous question about testing to see if the earlier date was less than 7, less than 14, or 14 or more days before the reference date.p  pI wanted to try and answer the related question of whether a given date is in the same calendar week Sunday to Saturday, or in the previous calendar week, or in an earlier calendar week.p  pMy first thought was to use the WEEKNUM function, so if the reference date is TODAY, this would be p  precodeIFWEEKNUMTODAYWEEKNUMA2gt1,Old,IFWEEKNUMTODAYWEEKNUMA2gt0,Last week,This week codepre  pHowever this doesnt work across year boundaries because WEEKNUM starts at 1 for each new year.p  pIn a normal year, WEEKNUM runs from 1 to 53 because there are just over 52 weeks in the year.  So it would appear that the above formula could be adapted to work across year boundaries simply by adding the YEARA2  52 or possibly 53 to the WEEKNUM.p  pHowever consider a leap year which starts on a Saturday and finishes on a Sunday. In this case WEEKNUM runs from 1 to 54.p  pThe last such leap year was 2000 and the next one is 2028.p  pIm not clear if it will work in every case.p  pThe reference date is 10th January 2001.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comqCPHv.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqCPHv.png altenter image description hereap  pI will try and post an answer later.p

Positive 14948 pIn particular column in ALL cells I have dropdown menu. Each cell contains it and those dropdown menus must stay there in every single cell of the same column. All of the options within dropdown menu are by far over 5 charachters long. However the point is that those dropdown menus are only suggesting me the value and dont yet provide the actual final value. When i pick wanted option from dropdown menu, I want to edit it and delete at least 80 of value size. However I am getting error message that value entered isnt valid and that user has limited value that may be entered. I think word limited is referred to size. Is there any way that I could keep in cell MUCH lower value in size than average size of all options in dropdown menu are BUT at the same time keep the actual dropdown menu so it still exist in each cell of the column I have excel 2013 pro.
