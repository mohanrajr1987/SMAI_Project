This does not comply with the terms of the iOS Developer Program License Agreement, as required by the App Store Review Guidelines.p  pSpecifically, section 3.3.12 of the iOS Developer Program License Agreement statesp  pYou and Your Applications and any third party with whom you have contracted to serve advertising may use the Advertising Identifier, and any information obtained through the use of the Advertising Identifier, only for the purpose of serving advertising. If a user resets the Advertising Identifier, then You agree not to combine, correlate, link or otherwise associate, either directly or indirectly, the prior Advertising Identifier and any derived information with the reset Advertising Identifier.p  pNote iAd does not use the AdSupport framework, ASIdentifierManager, or the Advertising Identifier. Therefore they are not required for iAd implementations and should not be included in your app for iAd support. p  pIf your app is serving ads, pleasep  ul lipEnsure that you have tested your app on a device, not just the simulator, and that you have removed all previous versions of your app prior to testingpli lipProvide us the steps to locate ads in your apppli ul  pIf your app does not serve ads, please check your code  including any thirdparty libraries  to remove any instances ofp  pclass ASIdentifierManager selector advertisingIdentifier framework AdSupport.frameworkp  pIf you are planning to incorporate ads in a future version, please remove the Advertising Identifier from your app until you have included ad functionality.p  pTo help locate the Advertising Identifier, use the nm tool. For information on the nm tool, please see the nm man page. p  pIf you do not have access to the libraries source, you may be able to search the compiled binary using the strings or otool command line tools. The strings tool lists the methods that the library calls, and otool ov will list the ObjectiveC class structures and their defined methods. These techniques can help you narrow down where the problematic code resides.p  pIve checked and after the game loads, a test advertisement appears within a few seconds on the simulator and device.  Is there a step Im missing or is this just a problem with Applep
Negative 292 pYes, exactly  destroy. Delete, remove whatever that eclipse would forget the syntax forever.p  pI went for every possible setting with immediate restart of ide  it refuses to skip the warnings and error messages. The worst thing that amongst trash messages I keep loosing the important ones.p  pBuilders, Validation , JavaScript setting folders  Ive been everywhere turned everything off both on project settings and general preferences. Tried even to turn off complete validation support. Reduced few hundreds errors to six yet again referring to .js files and yet again 1000s of warnings.p  pCant really chill out and want really to identify with relevant words eclipse developers. It just shouldnt be like that. I went to relevant threads, the solutions dont work. p  pVersion STS 2.9.2p  pstrongIs there any way to rip off the IDE from JS supportstrongp
