Positive 4545 pGCC has function attributes alwaysinline, noinline, and flatten which let you control inlining behavior when defining a function. Im wondering if there is a way to customize inlining behavior emwhere the function is calledem, rather than setting a global inlining behavior for it like the attributes normally do.p  pFor noinline, I can wrap a call inside a lambda with the noinline attribute and call the lambda immediately. For flatten I can wrap the function inside a template function that has truefalse specializations that call the underlying function, one with flatten and one without.p  pBut for alwaysinline I have no such hack. Does one exist To be clear, Im looking to be able to say that a specific call to codefcode should be inlined, not cause it to always be inlined everywhere.p

Negative 4545 pIm using Kendo UI Scheduler. I have a recurring event with couple exceptions. When I try to delete entire series of recurring event then in parameterMap function options.model contains only recurring event without exceptions. And after deletion these exceptions still exist on the scheduler, so i need reread datasource. br I checked on the a hrefhttpdemos.telerik.comkendouischedulerindex relnofollowkendo ui demo schedulera, in their example the options.model contains recurring event and all exceptions of this event and removes from scheduler the recurring event and all exceptions.p  pException has the recurrenceId to recurring event.br I would like to get in options.model exceptions as well.p  phere is my code br codep  precode function InitScheduler              Scheduler.kendoScheduler                 name Scheduler,                 date GetSelectDate,                 timezone GetTimeZone,                 views [                      type day, selected isActiveViewday ,                      type workWeek, selected isActiveViewworkWeek ,                      type week, selected isActiveViewweek ,                      type month, selected isActiveViewmonth                  ],                 dataSource                      batch true,                     transport                          read                              url CalendarSchedulerReader,                             type POST,                             dataType json                         ,                         create                              url CalendarSchedulerEditor,                             type POST,                             dataType json                         ,                         update                              url CalendarSchedulerEditor,                             type POST,                             dataType json                         ,                         destroy                              url CalendarSchedulerRemover,                             type POST,                             dataType json                         ,                                parameterMap functionoptions, operation                              here when operation  destroy options.models contains only one event without exception                             if operation  read ampamp options.models                                  return models kendo.stringifyoptions.models                                                                           ,                     serverFiltering true,                     schema                          data function response                              return response.Data                         ,                         model                              id id,                             fields                                  id from ApptID ,                                 entryID  from EntryID, type string ,                                 start  from Start, type date ,                                 end  from End, type date ,                                 startTimezone  from StartTimezone ,                                 endTimezone  from EndTimezone ,                                 title  from Subject ,                                 titleEvent  from TitleEvent ,                                 location  from Location ,                                 description  from Description ,                                 recurrenceId  from RecurrenceID ,                                 recurrenceRule  from RecurrenceRule ,                                 recurrenceException  from RecurrenceException ,                                 ownerId  from OwnerID, defaultValue 1 ,                                 isAllDay  type boolean, from IsAllDay ,                                 useTz  type boolean, from UseTimezones ,                                 history  from History ,                                 categories  from Categories, nullable true                                                                                                                    codepre  pcodep
