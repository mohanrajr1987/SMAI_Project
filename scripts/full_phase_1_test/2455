Positive 2455 pI am an autodidact, teaching myself how to program and script in different languages novice in Java, C, JavascriptNode.js, HTMLCSS, design projects and schematics, adding electronics and peripherals.p  pWhat I have seen a lot of while researching is the use of multiple languages to achieve a set of goals such as building a Web server in JavascriptNode to handle HTTP requests and responses, responding with a Web page written in HTML and customizedstylized with CSS and embedded with Javascript mannerisms or instead of Node, you write it in PHP or Python.p  pIm having a hard time wrapping my mind around WHY multiple languages are used instead of just one some highlevel languages are capable of performing a large portion, if not all, of the required tasks and HOW information is passed in between the different languages. Could one program call another I know that an HTML file can make calls to CSS and Javascript files, so, I understand that instancep  pI think the reason why I am hung up on this is because of my inexperience and lack of knowledge of other common languages. Does that mean that certain languages are meant to handle only specific tasks in a specific manner p  pI feel like some languages, such as Java and C, for example, can be used in various ways and in various instances to handle a myriad of different tasks. Is that not true of some of the others PHP amp Python, for instancep  pIm digging into the wealth of knowledge and the collective experience of some of the most brilliant minds this world has to offer but remember that I am new to this and I dont have the advantage of doing this in a classroom but I have read and own many books on programming in specific languages and the like. Please answer in a way that I and the others that may follow can understand.p  pThank you for your time and I look forward to the responses. p  pCheers.p  hr  pFantastic answers p  pIm curious though when working towards a solution for a specific problem, when does the programmer know when to stop in one language and continue a segment in another language p  pThats where I am confused. Is it typically up to the software developer and hisher own particular and artistic preference on how something is done or are certain things just not possible without using multiple languages p  pI do understand scripting and when its beneficial to use rather than a program or application and I know runtime executioncompiled code, environments and frameworks and virtual machines but none of that clearly lays out a defined perimeter or a limit in functionalityability for any particular language. Why call a C function in Python Could Python not accomplish what was needed in the first place and could choosing a more appropriate language have mitigated the need for adding another level of complexity to the solution I may be overthinking it but knowing this will guide me in my learning and help me map out better solutions as a programmer. p
Positive 2455 pI was wondering, as in the title Can I use JNI to bridge java code with languages other than ccobjective c, strongdirectlystrongp  pFor example if I want to use Csharp from my java code, will I have to use JNI in the standard way by invoking a cc method and from there somehow to call a csharp methodp  pOr is there a way that using JNI I can directly call Csharp code meaning it would have some library similar to the one implementing the jni.h in ccp  pI am not looking for other solutions on how to bridge javaCsharp, just to know if its possible with JNI.p

Positive 2455 pRecently Ive starting a project Im calling JIL or JIL Interfacing Language, and its to be a programming language of sorts. Now, I doubt it will ever be superuseful or versatile, but the aim of it is to be a step up from block programming, but a step down from complex languages like java, C, or C. JIL stands for JIL Interfacing Language because it is both intepreted and parsed in java, and all of its keywordsmethods will be intepreted and then executed in java. My question is would JIL count as a true programming language, or is it a false or secondary programming language that is nothing more than a java application.p
Positive 2455 pSo I found this a hrefhttpwww.wired.comwpcontentuploads201501lang.rank.plot.q1151.png relnofollowfascinating plota of programming languages crossranked by SO tags versus Github project usep  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comg7twH.png altProgramming languagesp  pSo, just naively interpreting this graph I figured that the more SO posts you have, the more difficulties you are having bugs, unexpected behavior, trying to figure out how to do something, etc, whereas the Github is a popularity metric. Therefore, according to this line of thinking, stuff in the lower right corner would be relatively easy to use, whereas stuff in the upper left would be the opposite. Stuff on the line would be normal ease of use, I am guessing.p  pIf this interpretation is correct, that would suggest strongCommon Lispstrong is king when it comes to ease of use, strangely enough. On the other hand, Cuda, SQL and XML, would be the kings of compexity and unreproduceable results no surprises there, LOL.p  pNow, one interesting thing is that VimL is so far on the easy side, even though it is reputedly a quirky language. Maybe that disproves the theory... or maybe VimL is really easy to use and emacs people are just vocal about how hard it is to use, even though it is not, hmmm....p  pIs this interpretation accuratep  pstrongUPDATEstrongp  pIt looks like Common Lisp was just an abberation due to bad data collection on the part of the originator. A new plot has been generated which is presumably more accurate and looks like thisp  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comf944o.png altProgramming Language Rankings 2p  pSo here Lisp has a more normal profile, and it seems TeX and VimL are the actual easy to usereliable languages. SQLXML and Cuda remain the baddies. Of course, if you went to Cuda looking for an easytouse, predictable language environment, you obviously went to the wrong place.p
Positive 2455 pI am trying to understand what it means for a language to be typesafe. In a dynamically typed language, the type checking is performed at run time, so for example if I run the following PHP codep  precodeltphp class MyClass      Create a MyClass instance mc  new MyClass   Create an int variable i  1234   Add mc and i result  mc  i gt codepre  pI will get an error because the code operatorcode does not support the codeMyClasscode data type. So basically the type checking was performed at run time.p  pDoes type safety means that type checking is performed regardless if it is performed at compile time or at run time, or does it mean that type checking must be performed only at compile time and so each variable must be given a data type explicitly like C, Pascal, Java, etc..p
Positive 2455 pDo declarative programming languages have statementsp  pOr, another way, are statements peculiar to imperative languagesp
Positive 2455 pDo any computer languages not use a stack data structure to keep track of execution progressp  pOr is the use of this data structure an emergent requirement stemming from something inherent to most computer languages or turing machinesp
Positive 2455 pSo, I was reading about Bitcoin Script on their official documentation and found this line strongScript is simple, stackbased, and processed from left to right. It is empurposefully not Turingcompleteem, with no loops.strong I tried to reason hard but couldnt understand why would someone make a language strongempurposefully non Turingcompleteemstrong. What is the reason for this What happens if a language become Turing Complete  And extending further, whether strongwith no loopsstrong has anything to do with the script being nonTuring Completep
Negative 2455 pWe always write functions or classes and their logic is very complicated.
