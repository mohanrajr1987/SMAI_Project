Positive 93851 pSo I found this a hrefhttprobertdickert.comblog20140509setupnavigationwithironrouterandbootstrap relnofollowNavigation Bar feature with Bootstrap3a, but as of now I am using FlowRouter instead of IronRouter. Thus I am seeking to transform this helper function into FlowRouter termsp  precodeTemplate.navItems.helpers     activeIfTemplateIs function template        var currentRoute  Router.current       return currentRoute ampamp         template  currentRoute.lookupTemplate  active         codepre  pI have made my own attempt at fixing the problem havent bothered testing it though, as many parts of my siteapp are still not functional, but I require confirmation in the form of a yes or no and perhaps a bit more information on what I did wrong.p  precodeTemplate.navItems.helpers     activeIfTemplateIs function template        var currentRoute  FlowRouter.current       return currentRoute ampamp         template  currentRoute.name  active         codepre  pI guided myself from the a hrefhttpsgithub.comkadirahqflowrouterapi relnofollowFlowRouter APIa.

Positive 93851 pI am trying to build a navbar in bootstrap 3 with a centered logo. The logo is a .svg file. I dont know how to exchange it for the brand text while allowing it to stay centered. Maybe someone out there has an idea. Let me know if there is anything you guys needp  pIm using this online svg logo as an example of what I want to do because I couldnt figure out how to do my logo on jsfiddle. They used an svg html tag. I dont know exactly what the benefits of this are, but it is in the example, so be aware. p  pThe important part is the css. This is what makes the navbar center, when most navbars in bootstrap are floated left or right.

Positive 93851 pI am having a hard time making a responsive web site using Fotorama and Bootstrap. It took me a day only to figure out what was going wrong, and I hope that someone can help me finding a way to sort things out.p  pI have a simple Bootstrap layout with a Fotorama fotorama.io gallery, set to be responsive datawidth100. The gallery is set up to show thumbnails.p  pEverything works perfectly until I resize the browser IE or Chrome, same result to the XS Bootstrap size and reload the page.p  pAt that point, Fotorama pictures are shown at a huge size, causing an horizontal scroll bar to appear. As soon as I resize the page to SM size Fotorama works correctly. If I resize back to XS things still work fine.p  pIn other words, only if the page is originally loaded at XS size the problem appears, otherwise everything is fine.p  pI have tracked the problem down to finding out that if I set a small size for thumbnails 20 pixels or less or I load just a few pictures 10 pictures instead of the 30 that I would normally load the page works fine even at XS. p  pHow can this be corrected  And if it cant be corrected, can anyone suggest a way to display iphone dots at XS resolutions and thumbnails at higher resolutionp  pThank you so much for your helpp
