Positive 34113 pI was doing some test on datastax java driver with Eclipse on Mac Pro. Basically, in the eclipse, I was using prepared and batch statement to write id, name, where id ranges from 10000 to 1000000 and names are student1  student10000according to the range of id.     After every time I run the code in eclipse, everything goes well, then I use nodetool cfhistograms and proxyhistograms, and cfstats to check the results. However, it seems to be weird. As I was looking forward to see the read latency and write lantency to increase, as I add the range from 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, the final result turns out to be decreasing on the latency.p  pFor example, for the cfhistograms of 10,000 first table and 100,000 second table strongPercentile  SSTables Write Latencystrong 50         0               14 75         0                20 95         0                42 98         0                60 99         0                60 Min          0                 5 Max          0                179p  pand 100,000 below strongPercentile  SSTables Write Latencystrong 50         0               10 75         0                12 95         0                24 98         0                29 99         0                42 Min          0                 3 Max          0                1109p  pAlso, for the proxyhistogram, 10, 000 strongPercentile  Read Latency Write Latencystrong 50         1331               72 75         1916                103 95         5722               215 98         5722                310 99         5722               372 Min          259                  30 Max          5722                11864p  pand 100,000 below strongPercentile  Read Latency Write Latencystrong 50         1331               42 75         1916                50 95         6866               103 98         6866                149 99         6866               215 Min          311                  18 Max          6866                61214p  pAnyone has any idea about thisp  pThanks in advancep  pStevenp

Is it possible in cassandra  If not what can be a solution to select columns based on a specific wildcard.p

Negative 34113 pGiven that the only way to unload dynamically compiled assemblies to reclaim memory is to unload the app domain, how does SharePoint rely on VirtualPathProviders, for master pages and page layouts in particular, without bumping into this limitationp  pThe restart can be delayed through various settings but not avoided completely when master pages and page layouts are updated and published frequently, correctp  pIs the lack of info on this attributed to it being a more theoretical limit thats not common in publishing patterns Have you personally noticed the rate of changes to master pages or layouts causing app instability Should SharePoint come with a warningp  pAny CMSesque capability that leverages dynamic WebForms including, by default, MVC views is susceptible to rateofchange instability, correctp  pstrongUpdate on NoCompile Pagesstrong p  pNocompile pages In ASP.NET 2.0, the compilation model has been significantly refactored and extended. Site precompilation is perhaps the most popular and loudly requested of the new features. Another quite interesting feature is nocompile pages. They are special pages that just never get compiled. So whats the ultimate purpose of nocompile pages, and whats the difference between them and static HTML pages  To start off, you create a nocompile page by setting the CompilationMode attribute on the Page directive to Never. When a nocompile page is requested, no page assembly is created and persisted to disk. Instead, an instance of the page builder component is cached in memory and used to create the page output for each and every request. The page builder is a special component that supports the page parser in building the page control tree. When compilation is turned on, the control tree is used to obtain a class to compile. When compilation is off, the control tree is used to obtain markup. Needless to say, classes are necessary if you want to give programmers the power of attaching their own code to the page. Nocompile pages are made of server controls and literals but contain no code at all. p  pNocompile pages are not for every application. They are exclusively designed for improving the scalability on very large web sites with thousands of pages. Nocompile pages cant be bound to a code file and cant contain a serverside  block. The only executable piece of code allowed in a nocompile page are expressions. There are two main benefits out of nocompile pages. In a secure environment like SharePoint, nocompile pages prevent developers from writing potentially buggy code that can cause problems to the hosting environment and even tear it down. In a large contentbased web site, nocompile pages avoid the need to compile thousands of pages. p  pReferencesp  p[1]  a hrefhttphaacked.comarchive20090422scripteddbviews.aspx relnofollowhttphaacked.comarchive20090422scripteddbviews.aspxap
