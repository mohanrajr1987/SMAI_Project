Positive 4317 pI want to know when should we use twodimensional pointer in objective c. I read a article about the runtime mechanism.

Positive 4317 pThe ObjectiveC runtime allows one to dynamically create and register class pairs using codeobjcallocateClassPaircode and codeobjcregisterClassPaircode respectively. Is it possible to get notified when a new class is added to the runtime Im only concerned with registered ObjectiveC classes if that helps, unregistered classes would be a bonus.p  pIf it is not possible to be notified, what is the next most efficient thing Most iOS devices have severe computational constraints, so my options are limited. Im open to a bit of runtime hackery if that would make it possible. I realize that I could just hook codeloadcode, but that would only work with NSObject subclasses, and not pure Swift classes. p  pemPureem Swift classes But pure Swift classes are not Objective C classes you say Think again. Try introspecting a pure Swift class using the runtime, and youll see that there is more to it than meets the eye How can one end up having a Swift class being added dynamically Well, I could just load a dynamic framework that uses Swiftp  pSince SpaceDog asked, this is for a developer utility that Im working on. For further clarification I do not myself know when codeobjcallocateClassPaircode or codeobjcregisterClassPaircode will be called, since my project is a library. p

The Target platforms for the commands are Windows 7 and UnixLinux.p  pI have a class that currently uses Runtime.exec along with the enhancements from the JavaWorld StreamGobbler article.  It works about 90 of the time on both Windows and Unix.  The other 10 of the time I need to extend the class and then fiddle with putting cmd.exe of binsh in front of the command.  Ive also had to fiddle sometimes between using a single String that has command and arguments to splitting the command and args into a String[] array.p  pMy latest is a new errorexception java.lang.IllegalArgumentException Executable name has embedded quote, split the arguments.  My current Runtime.exec class works fine in Eclipse running as a Java application, but once I build it and run from an actually command prompt, it fails with the above exception.p  pSo now Im reading that we should be using ProcessBuilder to do command line executables to the OS platform.p  pMy question is, what is the best alternative  Runtime.exec, ProcessBuilder, or some other option  Is there one option that will service both Windows and UnixLinux  If not, which one works best with Windows  Which one works best with UnixLinuxp  ptia, adymp

Positive 4317 pI have a DLL, wich is comercial software, so therefore i cannot show the code here... I get the error 6002 floating point support not loaded, but only on some applications.
