Positive 588 pIm trying to compare an image to a history of the same image to detect changes.  For organization I only want to keep unique images.

Positive 588 pMy first question here. I have a script with 2 arrays of objects where 1 property from object1 match 1 property from object 2. When the properties match, object1 gets a new property based on a property in object2. The range of properties can be around 520 different ones and the array holding object1 can easily contain 100 objects so if there is a better way to do it other than double loops that would be great, but i am still new to handlingcomparing objects in this way.p  pSo far i have this but it doesnt seem to work.p  precodeforeach vm in vms    foreach csv in csvs      if vm.location eq csv.ownerNode     vm  vm  AddMember MemberType NoteProperty Name csv Value csv.name         codepre  pemedit for more background, also posted further downem The reason i chose to use objects is that i need to add more and more properties as the scrip runs, then at the end use them around 45 properties per object to sort them and then do different actions based on the different properties.p
Positive 588 pI am trying to use C Expression Trees for a rule engine and ran into an issue with Version comparison. I would like the expression to do something like p  pVersion lt 4.5.1p  pbut C Expressions consider the version value as string and do not allow lessthan operator on it. I could create a custom method for this comparison by preidentifying the string value as a Version number RegEx comparison but I was hoping to find a way where C Expression can identify is directly.p  pI was not able to find any documentation or examples on how I can create an Expression that could compare versions. p  pAny help here would be appreciatedp
