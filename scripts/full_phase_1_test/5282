However, this is the only explanation Ive got so far and its very illusive in my opinion.p  pstrongUpdate 2strong Eventually weve been able to reproduce the issue several times, so this was not about memory leaks. I was considering authbind as a possible source of the problem when I faced it for the first time, but unfortunately I havent paid much attention to it. When I got another hardware box affected by the problem, I tried to bind nonpriveleged port and succeeded, while attempts to bind priveleged ports lead to exceptions. So, eventually Ive replaced authbind with iptables.p  pBasically, fady tahers answer points to authbind, but Danny Thomass answer provides very interresting information about connections between forking and Cannot allocate memory, actually we also use process builder to run bash scripts, so there is a great chance that the problem could be caused by it.p
