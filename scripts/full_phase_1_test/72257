Positive 72257 phi everyone i am working on a web program with PHP that can receive data forwarded from server via a web service ...p  pThe webservice providing the SendData method is designed to work as an endpoint service, that means data will be uploaded to that service. The service is not designed to request data from our servers The workflow is as follows The Machine sends data to our Example server which  forwards the data to the endpoint service that one that you develop by calling the SendData method. Therefore your service must be accessible from external our server so your need a port forward in your firewall and an static address e.g. a hrefhttpupload.mydomain.com4567dataupload relnofollowhttpupload.mydomain.com4567datauploada.p  pbut i have no idea how to do any of that i dont have any experience in this its my first time  so can anyone give a very detailed explanation about what should i do and how p

Positive 72257 pI should preface this post by saying that I am a very elementary developer with a generic IS degree. Without going into too much detail, I was given a moderately large web application from an interning software engineer to support an enhance if need be. It was written primarily in Python, JavaScript and HTML5 and utilizes a Google Map API to visually represent the location and uses of given inputs. This leads me to my question.p  pThere is a date picker modal that the applicationuser utilizes. They pick a START and END date, in the default format YYYYMMDD if the user does not use that exact format i.e. 20150929 the date picker will not work, and the application then goes to the DB and picks the given inputs between those dates and represents them on the map. I have been told that, for usability, I have to make the program accept multiple date formats i.e. September 29 2015, 09292015, 9292015, 9292015. How would I go about doing thisp

Negative 72257 pThis question is a little complex, so Im building up to it with some preamble so that the driver behind the question, and the code sample that demonstrates it, can be understood. p  ul liImmutable Builder Pattern with traits li liThe Universe pattern li liFinally the questionli ul  pstrongImmutable Builder patternstrongp  pI like traits a lot, but they can give problems with the immutable builder pattern. For example when I create an object that inherits the builder trait, when I call a set method on it, the builder trait is supposed to return me an identical clone of the original, apart from the value I have just set.p  pTo deal with this I often use a type statementp  precodetrait Builder    type RealBuilder lt Builder    ... codepre  pThis doesnt work fantastically well, but its adequate for most purposes. p  pstrongUniverse Patternstrongp  pI am experimenting with an idea taken from the Scala compiler. I have about ten generics, but I dont want the user to see most of them, and the generics are often linked together in complicated waysp  precodetrait Universe[X]     type A    type B    type RealBuilder lt MyBuilder    type RealBuiltThing lt MyBuiltThing    trait MyBuilder        def build          trait MyBuiltThing       codepre  pSo the nice thing here is that everything defined inside the Universe shares the same generics, and the code for those classes, and their usage isnt polluted by tons of generics.p  pstrongFinally the questionstrongp  pI want to pass a function to the builder inside the universe and get a nice toString. So I am wrapping the function which in this simple example is just X and then passing the wrapped object to the setIt methodp  precodeclass Wrapper[X]x X, string String    override def toString  string   object Outer     def someProperty[X c.WeakTypeTag]c ContextsomeValue c.Expr[X]            c.Expr[OuterInnerBuilder]    lt This is the first line referenced below     import c.universe.     val xString  showsomeValue.tree     reify  c.Expr[OuterInnerBuilder]c.prefix.tree.splice.setItnew Wrapper[X]someValue.splice, c.literalxString.splice        class Outer     trait InnerBuilder      type RealInnerBuilder lt InnerBuilder     type B     def someProperty[X]someValue X  macro Outer.someProperty[X]     def setIt[X]w Wrapper[X] RealInnerBuilder         printlnSetting it to   w shows that the code got here       this.asInstanceOf[RealInnerBuilder] in practice would return a new instance that held the wrapper            class InnerBuilder1 extends InnerBuilder      type RealInnerBuilder  InnerBuilder1      codepre  pIf I now create an InnerBuilder1 and call someProperty, the println statement executes. Hurrahp  pBUT and its a big but... Ive lost some type safety. The companion object is returning an object of c.Expr[OuterInnerBuilder], and what it really wants to do is to return the InnerBuilder class of c.prefix.p  pIm sad to say that I dont fully understand the [] notation is Scala. So the following are probably just naive. Ive tried returning c.Expr[c.prefix.actualType], which is the idea of what I want, but it obviously isnt correct.p  pCould anyone advise me on how to bring the type safety back to this Macrop
