Positive 7429 pI was experimenting with RTE buttons and found that the copy pasting from word to RTE allows all styles to be intact. So i read a a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3406415sitecoreforcingpastingasunformattedtextposta and got rid of the extra formatting. Now i want to deal with blank spaces and line breaks. So, with some analysis i have decided to allowp  pOne blank space for single line break. Statements to be shown as single paragraph.For examplep  precode    This is new. ltbrgt This is weird. should become ltpgtThis is new. ampnbspThis is weird.ltpgt codepre  pIf multiple line breaks are found, then all break separated statements should act as single paragraph with only single break between them.

Positive 7429 pI installed a fresh Sitecore 7.0 instance on my local. I created an Item bucket. I thought of creating folder structure on the basis on name like pages starting with alphabet should go in a folder named A as the page names are not supposed to change.

Negative 7429 pI have two examples that first is OneToOne unidirectional mapping and second bidirectional.
