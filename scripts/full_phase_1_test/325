Positive 325 pI have a WIX file .wxs in which we are using USERDOMAIN environment variable to retrieve the domain of the logged in user. For eg., it gives DOMAINA for a user logged in as DOMAINAuser1. This extracted domain name is then used to prefix other Security Groups that are used to ACL web resources.p  pIt was working fine until now. But now, due to security restrictions, the logged in user is not from the same domain the server and applications run. The user is logged in from a Management domain, say DOMAINM. Now, USERDOMAIN does not help as the resources are ACLed with incorrect SGs, like DOMAINMSG1, etc, which dont exist.p  pWhat are my options to retrieve the domain of the server so that it can be used in the WIX file for generating MSI for deploymentp  pThanks for your helpp

Positive 325 pI work on local websites with a Wamp installation on a Windows 10 machine upgraded from 8.1.p  pInitially, I assigned a fake .dev domain for each local site using vhosts in Wamp.p  pThen, as Chrome started indicating an codeICANNNAMECOLLISIONcode for those domains, I switched to Firefox. I could even still use chrome if I used the hosts file to point the local ip to the desired domain.p  pHowever, one day, suddenly I was not able to use my .dev domains on any browser other than MS Edge and Maxthon. I searched extensively for an alternative or sollution to no avail. Most people would suggest using another TLD instead of .dev, but it didnt work as well.p  pA friend suggested that maybe my Windows 10 had a problem handling DNS, to which I cannot answer for sure. I am going to format my machine and downgrade to Windows 8.1, by the way, because of some other instabilities in W10.p  pstrongPutting it shortstrong supposed I can fix the DNS problem by downgrading, what alternative do I have to serve local websites with a TLD, since .dev is no longer an option in Chromep  pThank you.p
