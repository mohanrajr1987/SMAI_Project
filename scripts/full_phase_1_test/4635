Negative 4635 pIn Excel 2010 VBA, Im using the FileExists property of the FileSystemObject to check whether a file exists. On my computer it works fine. But on another Excel 2010 computer, it reports that the file is not there when in fact we see in Windows Explorer that the file is there. In both cases, the file being checked is on the local hard drive.p  pIm checking for the file right after using Shell to unzip the file. I use DoEvents after the unzip.

So you can get the filename including extension like thisp  precodestrShellZippedFileInZipfileFilename  RightoShellZippedFileInZipfile.Path, InStrStrReverseoShellZippedFileInZipfile.Path, Application.PathSeparator  1 codepre
