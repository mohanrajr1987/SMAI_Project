Positive 386 pMy git is having a lot of issues lately. 5 days ago it was working perfectly and now, I cant do anything with it. When I am trying to clone codecode push whatever, git is asking me for a password that I do not have for example if I try to clone codegitbitbucket.orgnameproject.gitcode, git is asking me for gitbitbucket.orgs password. Also every first time that I try to clone, this message appears p  hr  precodeWARNING POSSIBLE DNS SPOOFING DETECTED            The ECDSA host key for bitbucket.org has changed, and the key for the corresponding IP address ... is unknown.

Positive 386 pBasically what it says in the question but my real purpose is to create a docker container in AWS to which I can push my code from git to do the deployment within the container. p  pSo, lets say I have a docker image that has my environment all setup. It also has codebarecode git repository which has codepostreceivecode hook that copies my file to specified dir within the container. That container has necessary ports exposed for me to access my app. p  pI have been successful on creating my image and setting it up in AWS but where Im stuck is that I dont know how to connect my local machine to the container thats inside AWS. p  pIve tried port mapping while running like sop  pcodedocker run d i p 803000 p 802222 aws binbashcodebr where code3000code is the port that Im exposing from my container from my app and I was hoping to map ssh port of the container to some different port in my AWS instance code8022code. p  pStill, no luck so far. Any help would be appreciated or if Im going about this the wrong way then thatd be appreciated as well. Im aware that this is a bit of overkill but I want this to be on EC2 not Amazons container service only. p

Positive 386 pI have several nodes that are sharing ssh keys actually they are some virtual machines and sharing the home directory. I want them to be able to ssh into each other and itself, localhost without password, which is a requirement of setting up a hadoop cluster. For example, I have master node, slave1 node and slave2 node. They have same ssh key, which is from the master node. If I ssh slave1 from master node, it should be passwordless. Same for all nodes. How can I do thatp
Positive 386 pIm running Xubuntu 15.04 and have been building Android for several months. I recently got into using Gerrit to cherry pick and review code.
