Negative 85786 pOk here is the deal a bit wordy but I hope you will get the ideap  pI use MVVM for binding properties of a combo. The combobox is bound to a ListCollectionView with source collection of employee objects which is sorted by the emp. name . There is binding on SelectedValue of the combobox by the p  pemployee id. DisplayMember is employee name. The above employee class doesnt implement INotifyPropertyChanged but the EmployeeViewModel which has EmployeeView the ListCollectionView above and the SelectedEmployeeId bound to selectedvalue above properties, does.p  pI have employees the employee class is without INotifyPropertyChanged as a cached observable collection. So whenever someone modifies the cache the UI bound with that data refreshes. When someone changes the name property of the employee base class the values reflect back toop  pSop  pOne Question  Is observable Collection sufficient to reflect automatic property changes without INotifyPropertyChanged interface implemented on indv. items I thought it doesnt do that automatically but I can see it happening p  hr  pNow let me explain how I use the ListCollectionView. I have implemented a specific CompositeCollection called Observable Composite Collection that uses a collection container which hosts the cached observable collection of employees and another container in the same composite collection hosts the plain list of some misc items that are generally available on the comboboxes such as  and .p  pThis specific composite collection class exposes a ListCollectionView property which has the source collection as a local array list. This array list is refreshed cleared and added when collectionnchanged event for the observable cache above is handled. p  pI have to use this view via this ObservableCompositeCollection because ...p  ol lisorting is needed on composite collection which is only possible thru a custom collection view li liThe view is based on the same array list which is active by reference all the time thereby relfecting the changes when bound to multiple itemscontrols.li liWhen collectionnchanged event is handled I call View.Refresh and updates take place automatically.li liI want to persist the selections on the bound itemsControls which could be any in my application.li ol  pAnyways so far its all good enough. When my employeeViewModels EmployeeView property is loaded using this CompositeCollections collection view property by hosting employee cache and  item list in it, the combobox updates items nicely as and the cache is changed by other processes. p  pMain problem is when I update an employee name which is currently selected on the combobox, the selection box item remains unchanged. If you expand the combo and have a look at the items then you do see the changed employee name in the item list. But the changes are not relflected on the selection box item of the combo.p  pNow if you change the combobox to a ListBox change only the XAML tag   pFutile Remedies I tried with combo....p  ol lipRefresh the selectedValue by setting employeeViewModel.SelectedEmployeeId  0 this correctly selcts  and then back to the original value employee id 101.
