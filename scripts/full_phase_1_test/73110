Positive 73110 pIm included SignalR classes via pods as pod SignalRObjC in my objective C project. Im getting error AFHttpClient.h file not found because of updated AFNetworkingcurrently 2.x classes. I dont want to degrade AFNetworking version to 1.3 or earlier Kindly let me know if there is any alternative of implementing SignalR in iOS.p  pThanks Sandeepp

Positive 73110 pI have a HTML5 app which uses SignalR to receive its data.  Im now trying to port this to Android Wear using CocoonJS.p  pWhen I launch the app using CocoonJS Launcher on Android phone and select WebView the application runs as expected, likewise it works fine in Chrome.  However, if I launch using Canvas view the application fails with a 500 error from the SignalR server hosted with OWIN, MVC C. p  pI need it to work with Canvas so it will work on Android Wear.p  pThe server error is p  blockquote   pUnexpected character encountered while parsing value . Path , line   1, position 1p blockquote  pand comes from NewtonSofts ParseValue before hitting any of my code.p  pIve compared the requests from a working version using WebView and the failing request using Canvas and the key difference seems to be that the connectionData parameter of the querystring is double encoded or is this just a red herringp  pIve tried a hack to intercept the request by overriding XMLHttpRequest.prototype.open and to decodeURIComponent the connectionData but I still get the error. I tried a bigger hack to manually encode and override the urlp  precodeif url.indexOfconnectionData gt 0                  var splitUS  url.splitamp                 var splitConn  url.splitampconnectionData                  url  splitConn[0]  ampconnectionData5B7B22name2222myhub227D5Damp  splitUS[1]              codepre  pHowever, this then was received by the server as p  blockquote   pPathWithQueryString   signalrserversignalrnegotiateclientProtocol1.5ampconnectionDatastrong25strong5B257B2522name25222522myhub2522257D255Damp1441646187794p blockquote  pSo it seems to have double encoded the first  sign, replacing it with 25. Ive also tried to leave the [ and ] without encoding but that still caused the same error.p  pIve also hacked the jquery.signalR.js to remove the encodingp  precode     if connection.data                      preparedUrl  ampconnectionData  window.encodeURIComponentconnection.data preparedUrl  ampconnectionData  connection.data              codepre  pbut that didnt seem to make any difference, it remained double encoded.p  pI suspect that Canvas is causing the same issue as this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions28897251signalrconnectiondataparameterisencodedtwiceinie8SignalR connectionData parameter is encoded twice in IE8a but theres no proposed solution for that.p  pCan anyone shed any light on this Whats doing the encoding I know JQuery will encode a XHR request and I know SignalR does maybe hence the double encoding but why does it only fail when using CocoonJS Canvas and not in any other environmentp

Negative 73110 pId like to be able to see how expensive each thread in my application is using callgrind.  I profiled with the codeseparatethreadyescode option which gives you a callgrind file for the whole app and then one perthread.  p  pThis is useful for viewing the profile of any given thread, but what I really want is just a sorted list of CPU time from each thread so I can see which threads are the the biggest hogs.p
Negative 73110 pSo, in a Windows 8 tablet application, I have a GridView with the following propertyp  precode    ltGridgt         ltGridView ItemsSourceBinding SourceStaticResource manager, PathTestStrings gt     ltGridgt codepre  pThat links to the property TestStrings in one another class.p  precodepublic Listltstringgt TestStrings              get                      ListltLocationgt locations  getLocations               Listltstringgt testStrings  new Listltstringgt              for int i  0 i lt locationList.Count i                              testStrings.AddlocationList[i].Name                           return testStrings                    public async TaskltListltLocationgtgt getLocations              return await xmlParser.getLocations      codepre  pIf I simply populate a string List with values and return it, the GridView displays the values, no problem. However, the issue is that I need to call an async method. Most of my data will be coming from an XML file. To access an XML file, I have to pull the file from storage, which far as I know requires me to await. Here, is that methodp  precodepublic async TaskltListltLocationgtgt getLocations              StorageFolder storageFolder  ApplicationData.Current.LocalFolder         StorageFile file  await storageFolder.GetFileAsyncmain.xml         XmlDocument xmlDoc await XmlDocument.LoadFromFileAsyncfile         XDocument xml  XDocument.ParsexmlDoc.GetXml          ListltLocationgt locationList              from location in xml.Elementapps.Elementsapp.Elementslocations.Elementslocation              select new Location                                Name  location.Elementname.Value,              .ToList          return locationList      codepre  pAs you see, I await twice which forces me to make it an async method, which  means all methods that call it must be async. However, the binding property in XAML requires I access a property, which cannot be async.p  pI feel I am missing something. Ive recently moved over from Android to start programming in Windows 8, so a lot of it is new to me. Surely, displaying data from files to the UI is a common task. What is the best way to handle itp
Negative 73110 pI have been reading the cpuinfo file on my Samsung Galaxy sghi897 to retrive the bogoMIPS value.  And just now learning how to interpret such information. p  pInitially I did this under the main activity in a loading thread, and ALWAYS got a value of 997.59.  I then moved the file reading method into a Service since I didnt need it in the UI until much later anyways.  Once I did this, the value I read became quite different, and seems to change for each application start, always much slower, like in the 300 to 500 range.p  pMy questions arep  ol lipDoes the Android OS  Linux cause a measurement of the bogoMIPS value and modify the cpuinfo file periodically pli lipIf so, is there a programatic way to force it pli lipWhy would it vary depending on if I am reading the file from a Service verses the main activity thread pli lipUltimately, if one wants the most correct number is it best to simply write our own timing loops to get it ourselves at the moment we need it assuming its changing, due to cpu load, all the time anyhowpli ol
