The server may not be running in an account with identity hosthvwsvr01. If the server is running in a service account Network Service for example, specify the accounts ServicePrincipalName as the identity in the EndpointAddress for the server. If the server is running in a user account, specify the accounts UserPrincipalName as the identity in the EndpointAddress for the server.p blockquote  pSince its a selfhosted service I suppose I need to specify the UserPrincipalName, but no matter what I try for that property it just wont work.p  ul lidomainusernameli lidomainusernameli lihostlocalhostli lihosthvwsvr01li li... and so onli ul  pTried it with different user accounts aswell, including the builtin Administrator. If I try BasicHttpBinding instead of WSHttpBinding everything works as expected. I read tons of articles about that problem on google and stackoverflow but I still cannot figure what the problem is and how to specify that identity.p  pEdit Service App.Configp  precode   ltsystem.serviceModelgt   ltservicesgt      ltservice nameSIT.Communication.Gategt         lthostgt            ltbaseAddressesgt               ltadd baseAddresshttplocalhost2323SIT gt            ltbaseAddressesgt         lthostgt         ltendpoint address bindingwsHttpBinding contractSIT.Core.IGategt            ltidentitygt               ltdns valuelocalhostgt               ltuserPrincipalName valueXZDomDGraingt            ltidentitygt         ltendpointgt         ltendpoint addressmex bindingmexHttpBinding contractIMetadataExchange gt      ltservicegt   ltservicesgt   ltbehaviorsgt      ltserviceBehaviorsgt         ltbehaviorgt            ltserviceMetadata httpGetEnabledTruegt            ltserviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaultsTrue gt         ltbehaviorgt      ltserviceBehaviorsgt   ltbehaviorsgt codepre  pp  pEdit The Client itself is basically just this code fragmentp  blockquote precode        ChannelFactoryltIGategt sitFactory  new ChannelFactoryltIGategtnew WSHttpBinding, new EndpointAddresshttphvwsvr012323SIT         IGate sitProxy  sitFactory.CreateChannel         bool pong  sitProxy.Ping lt throws exception codepre blockquote
Negative 2783 pIn the following code a hrefhttpjsfiddle.netueP5U1 relnofollowhttpjsfiddle.netueP5U1ap  pi have a table in which every tdth member is given a relative index by its codelttrgtcodep  precodevar tableIterator  functiontable, process  .eachtable.children, function  cycle through thead,tbody,tfoot     this.children.eachfunction  cycle through thead, tbody, tfoot trs         process.callthis           tableIteratortable, function    this.findtd,th.eachfunction      this.textIndex   this.index      codepre  pp  pThe table can contain two or more headers where the parent header gets a bigger colspan and the bottom header conforms by giving the equivalent amount of columns i.e index 4 has two children indexed 1 and 2.p  pWhat im actually trying to do is to make the parent header, select all its children not actual dom children of course, and make the same action based on the selected column.p  pI got the logic down each header element, needs to find its previous sibling children indexes and add the amount of colspan to its own children ot get their indexes i.e index 5[colspan2], going to index 4, finding its last child index 1 and adding the amount of colspans to its children so they will have index 2 and index 3 1colspan.val timesp  psame goes with its tbody children.p  pi assume that i need to create an object array containing the bind elements according to whatever is shown using jQuery.filterreturn thead.findByColumn2[or any other top header index]p  pwould love some assistance since im having trouble even beginning this, examples with highlight by click, hiding by maxwidth or running things on columns according to selections are more than welcomep
Negative 2783 pToo often people write tests that dont clean up after themselves when they mess with state.  Often this doesnt matter since objects tend to be torn down and recreated for most tests, but there are some unfortunate cases where theres global state on objects that persist for the entire test run, and when you run tests, that depend on and modify that global state, in a certain order, they fail.p  pThese tests and possibly implementations obviously need to be fixed, but its a pain to try to figure out whats causing the failure when the tests that affect each other may not be the only things in the full test suite.  Its especially difficult when its not initially clear that the failures are order dependent, and may fail intermittently or on one machine but not another.  For examplep  precoderspec test1spec.rb test2spec.rb  failures in test2 rspec test2spec.rb test1spec.rb  no failures codepre  pIn RSpec 1 there were a hrefhttprspec.infodocumentationtoolsspec.htmlsome options reverse, loadbya for ordering test runs, but those have disappeared in a hrefhttprelishapp.comrspecrspeccorev26rcdircommandlineRSpec 2a and were only minimally helpful in debugging these issues anyway.p  pIm not sure of the ordering that either RSpec 1 or RSpec 2 use by default, but one custom designed test suite I used in the past randomly ordered the tests on every run so that these failures came to light more quickly.  In the test output the seed that was used to determine ordering was printed with the results so that it was easy to reproduce the failures even if you had to do some work to narrow down the individual tests in the suite that were causing them.  There were then options that allowed you to start and stop at any given test file in the order, which allowed you to easily do a binary search to find the problem tests.p  pI have not found any such utilities in RSpec, so Im asking here What are some good ways people have found to debug these types of order dependent test failuresp
Negative 2783 pIm working on a Spree application, and I had to override a view without using Deface. So I created an codehtml.erbcode file in the same path of its Spree original counterpart, and with the same name. It works. Now Id like to define a helper to be used in such a view, so I tried to create a decorator file for the helper used in the original view, and to extend the helper module using codemoduleevalcode. Its not working...p
