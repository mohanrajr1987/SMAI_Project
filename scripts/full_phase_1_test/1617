Positive 1617 pIm trying to learn swift by creating different short games or apps. while trying to test my new gain knowledge on a game, I realized that I need to create a func that I didnt know how to create. Ive looked around and none of the answers Ive found really helped me understand what I have to do.p  pIll summarize my gamep  pIts a single view app.  Ive got five func.p  pI want to randomly pick a function to be executed.p  pAfter the function is executed the user will press a button that runs the random pick function again to randomly pick a func, but this time only out of the four other func that are left, and so on. At the same time once the five functions have been executed I want to restart the pick a random func all over again. so the game goes on and on for ever.p  pIm not sure how to place the func In an array to make it work.p  pFor example Ive been using the following script in the game.p  pFunc one generates a Label that shows a random string.p  pIve used the following script to create a random word generator for a label with out repeats and once it runs through all the words in the array it restarts again randomly. It works perfectlyp  precode    struct randword       var wordstring  String       var stentenceword  [randword]    var stentecenumber  Int     func wordsinsentence       sentenceword  [randowordwordstringHouse, randowordwordstringTruck, randowordwordstringLadder]        func pickword       if sentenceword.count gt 0            sentencenumber  random   sentenceword.count           wordlabel.text  sentecneword[sentencenumber].wordstring        sentenceword.removeAtIndexsentencenumber           if sentenceword.count lt 0           wordsinsentence  codepre  pFunc two generates a random Image using the same script as before, just slightly modified for images.p  pFunc three is a timer game with another script... and so on..etc etc.p  pNow I want all five func to randomly be picked and removed then once there arent anymore left to restart, as on the example script I placed above.p  pIve tried using the same script and modifying it to replace the string array with a function array, but with no positive result.p  pCan anyone help me with a solution or showing me another option of how I should do itp
Positive 1617 pThis question has derived from a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions32700265howtomakechararrayavaliableinmultiplecppfilesthis onea.p  pI have a working program which must be split into multiple parts.

Put the required state into a struct or class, and pass it to functions as necessary as a parametercode And I also have found many web pages pointing that is not recommended to use global variables.p  pAnd, as far I can understand, in the answer provided by PaulH., he is describing how to make variables avaliable  by making them global. This answer was very useful, it worked fine not only with char arrays, but also with codeintcodes, codestringcodes and GTK variables or pointers to variables P.p  pBut since this method is not recommended, I would thank anyone who could show what would be the correct way to split the code passing the variables as a function parameter or some other method more recommended than the  working  global variables one.p  pstrongemI researched about parameters and classes, but Im a newbie, and I messed the code up with no good result.emstrongp  pThanks for any help.p

Some objects of the SQLLite database have to access to objects in the InMemory database. I found in the Apple Documentation a way to make it work using fetched properties so they say, look at the CrossStore Relationships paragraph here  a hrefhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaConceptualCoreDataArticlescdRelationships.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.apple.comlibrarymacdocumentationCocoaConceptualCoreDataArticlescdRelationships.htmla. The thing is, when the predicate is executed, I get a KVC compliant error p  pTerminating app due to uncaught exception NSUnknownKeyException, reason [ valueForUndefinedKey] this class is not key value codingcompliant for the key stationId.p  pHeres the model. I have a ManagedStation object which is stored in the SQL Lite database. I have a ManagedPassingTime object which is stored in memory. The ManagedStation is supposed to have a NSSet of ManagedPassingTimes. To do so, I added a stationId attribute to the ManagedPassingTime. When loading a Station, I create the needed ManagedPassingTime objects and set the stationId of the ManagedPassingTime to the ManagedStation.identifier property. Finally, I created a fetched property passingTimes in the ManagedStation object which has the following predicate  FETCHSOURCE.identifier MATCHES FETCHEDPROPERTY.stationId. The fetched property has the ManagedPassingTime object set as Destination.p  pSince stationId is an attribute of ManagedPassingTime, I dont understand why the value cannot be accessed using KVC. I even tried to override the valueForUndefiniedKeyNSStringkey method in ManagedPassingTime, but it seems that I never enter this methods.p  pIf any of you guys has even the tiniest idea, it would be most helpful.
