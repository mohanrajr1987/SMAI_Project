Positive 4371 pHow could I make 3 substrings of a version string that looks like this 1.0.0 and is subject to having variable version string lengths, for instance 1.10.1, or 2.15.10.

Negative 4371 pI like the random color generation algorithm a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions43044algorithmtorandomlygenerateanaestheticallypleasingcolorpaletteanswertabvotestabtopproposed here by David Crowa, but I wonder if theres a way to focus its results around a single color and regulate the results.p  pMy program will be generating graphs that track a number of variables. Each variable belongs to one of 7 categories. Id like to generate linecolors for these variables that are legible, unique and for which the hue, saturation and luminosity are within a proximate range of a root color which is associated with their category. For example, category Reds variables would be various legible and discernible variations on red.p  pOne solution might be to declare a root color, plus upper and lower boundaries for hue, saturation and luminosity. I could then randomly pull values from within those ranges, but is there a better way to hopscotch within those three dimensions so that the resulting colors have a decent amount of variation, but still leaving space to grow For example, assume each pipe is a range value and each line is an iterationp  precode01 gt  02 gt  03 gt  04 gt  05 gt  06 gt  07 gt  08 gt  09 gt  10 gt  11 gt  12 gt  13 gt  14 gt  15 gt  codepre  pWhats the best way to do this Or is this even the best solution to my problem A single graph may not plot more than 4 or 5 variables, but the number of variables which can be plotted could be in the hundreds.p  pThanks for your help.p
