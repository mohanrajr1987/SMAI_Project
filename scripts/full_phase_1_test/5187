Positive 5187 pCreate a class diagram based on the following descriptionp  pIn the modern world, many retail stores and even residential properties install video monitoring systems. A customer, who has a unique address, can choose to have one or more video monitoring system. Each video monitoring consists of a set of components namely video archive, video display, and video capture.p  pVideo archive stores video data according to a storage path either locally or through FTP. The video store operation will be different in each case.p  pThe video capture has a unique vendor with unique factory address and its main operation is to capture video. The video capture can be associated with any number of cameras.p  pAny camera will have a status attribute to define if it online or offline and it should stream the video buffer to the video capture component. There are two types of cameras IP camera or an analog camera. The stream video buffer operation will depend on the type of the camera. Moreover, if the camera is an analog camera then it will contain one encoder component inside it to encode raw video data from the camera sensor.p  pFinally, the customer is able to retrieve the video data only from local archive in the current system through the date and time parameters using a retrieve video operationp  pWhat i have done so far......p  pI have created a class customer with name and address as attribute and retrieve as operation with a 1 to many multiplicity.Then i made an aggregrate relationship between class and video system. Beneath customer i created a class video monitoring system with no attribute and no operation. Beneath class video monitoring system, I made a generalization relationship connecting Video archive has store as operation, video display and video capture. Video capture has Unique Address and capture as operation. Under capture, I made an association relationship with Ip camera and Analog camera and next to those is another class camera sensor that has raw data as attribute.......When I saw some of my class mates, answers today it wasnt as clumsy and bulky as mine.Their own look really professional I guess because nearly all of them have industrial experience unlike me. I just started learning programming last month really.....I need help.p

Positive 5187 pI have 3 Classes, each with a method to create either a Textfield, Button or Textlabel. I have set up my program so that a Textfield prompts you for a name, which is then stored in the name1 String variable. I also use a Textlabel that has its setTextname1, but when I run it, it is saying NullPointer.
