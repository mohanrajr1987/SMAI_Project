Positive 390 pI need to clean up some subdirectories inside my music collection from unwanted images. Im using Ubuntu 14.04 andor Linux Mint 17.2 and a bash shell script using the emfindem command.p  pThe directory structure minimal example is as followsp  precodeTagged   Artist 1     Artist 1  An Album       Artist 1  A Track.flac       cover.jpg       something.png     Artist 1  [compilations]       Artist 1  A Track.flac       cover.jpg       something.png   Artist 2     Artist 2  Another Album       Artist 2  A Track.mp3       cover.jpg codepre  pemOnlyem in the subfolders ending with [compilations], I want to delete all kind of jpeg andor png images because the tagging software erroneously puts them there. Any images that happen to be in normal album folders I wish too keep.p  pWith my directory structure, folders with [compilations] in the name can only happen just below the Artist folders, repectively so a maximum of two levels deep.p  pI came up with the following find commandp  precode cd Tagged  find . maxdepth 2 type d name [compilations] exec find  type f iname .jpg or iname .png delete  codepre  pThis seems to do something and takes a while, but the files em.Artist 1Artist 1  [compilations]cover.jpgem and em.Artist 1Artist 1  [compilations]something.pngem are still there and all other image files.p  pBeing quite new to Linux, I assume I make a dumb mistake using emfindems emdeleteem option, because the following command without emdeleteem shows the files correctlyp  precode find . maxdepth 2 type d name [compilations] exec find  type f iname .jpg or iname .png  .Artist 1Artist 1  [compilations]cover.jpg .Artist 1Artist 1  [compilations]something.png codepre  pSo here are my questionsp  ul liWhy does the emdeleteem not workli liIs this command really safe regarding extravaganza like whitespace, glob characters and foreign characters in the paths and filenamesli liHow would I have to rewrite the above command, still using embashem and emfindemli liCould the command be optimized re speed, safety, nested findsli ul  pIn the actual collection, the command must traverse 16899 folders, almost all of them contain whitespace and foreign characters like Czech, Russian, Japanese, Greek, German , so it must be robust.p  pThanks in advance for any insights and some enlightenmentp
