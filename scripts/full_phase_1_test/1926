Positive 1926 pI have just come up with something that I dont understand. Im trying to return a parametrized type from a method, the code is the following working examplep  precodetrait Expression  case class ExpImp1 extends Expression case class ExpImp2 extends Expression  object Main     private def testParametrizedTypes[T] T       ExpImp1       private def testWrappedParametrizedTypes[T lt Expression] Option[T]       Somenew ExpImp1       def mainargs Array[String]        codepre  pbut when I compile this code, the compiler says the IDE warns me about the same error in both functionsp  precodeError10, 12 type mismatch  found    ExpImp1  required T     ExpImp1             codepre  pI think that the code showed previously should work. In the first method Im returning a type T and T has no constraint. The compiler error also occurs in the second method, but the parametrized type conforms to the returned object type too.p  pAlso, I wrote a code a few weeks ago that looked like that that compiled with no problems this is not a working example as this code is part of a Play Framework projectp  precodeclass CanBeAuthenticatedRequest[A]val request Request[A] extends WrappedRequest[A]request  class UnauthenticatedRequest[A]override val request Request[A] extends CanBeAuthenticatedRequestrequest  class AuthenticatedRequest[A]val user String, override val request Request[A] extends CanBeAuthenticatedRequest[A]request  object CanBeAuthenticatedAction extends ActionBuilder[CanBeAuthenticatedRequest]     def invokeBlock[A]...       object Fold       private def partialFunctionBuilder[T]authenticated AuthenticatedRequest[] gt T                                          unauthenticated UnauthenticatedRequest[] gt T     PartialFunction[CanBeAuthenticatedRequest[], T]         case ar AuthenticatedRequest[] gt authenticatedar       case ur UnauthenticatedRequest[] gt unauthenticatedur           def apply[T]request CanBeAuthenticatedRequest[]                authenticated AuthenticatedRequest[] gt T                unauthenticated UnauthenticatedRequest[] gt T T         partialFunctionBuilderauthenticatedunauthenticatedrequest            codepre  pAs you can see, I successfully defined the function partialFunctionBuilder and Im using it.p  ppartialFunctionBuilder follows the same pattern, returning a type that is parametrized with T. I dont see whats the difference between the code I showed first and the Play Framework code. Removing lt Expression from the testWrappedParametrizedTypes keeps giving me the same error.p

As far as I understand has T to be a subtype of Object which also has to implement the Comparable interface which is also parameterized via a generic parameter. The parameter of Comparable states that is have to be some supertype of T. Due to that we have some kind of recursive type definition.p  pBut here is my question As far as I know every type in Java is a subtype of Object, so why do they specify it within the definition of Tp
