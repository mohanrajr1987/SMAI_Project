Positive 8403 pIve been trawling the internet for this, and although Ive found quite a lot all the solutions seem to be different sop  pPlease could someone give me a concise explanation of how to extract rotation data i.e. xyz from a matrix4 structure. p  pI understand that a matrix 4 is used to hold information on translation, scale and rotation but thats about as far as it goes. Im coding for iOS and using GLKit.p
Positive 8403 pHow can I make a gameObject rotate while jumping in the air, then once it collides with another gameObject, return smoothly to its original rotation like shown in the following video a hrefhttpsyoutu.beiOV0Apuwj94 relnofollowhttpsyoutu.beiOV0Apuwj94ap  pI do not want the cube to abruptly return to its original rotation once it has collided with something. Like in the video, the cubes rotation is just right when it collides when it hits the ground, it feels natural. I also want the cube to know where the future collision is, so that it can modify speed, rotation etc. depending on the positions of each gameObject this way, the rotation would be always correct too.p  pI have tried many times fine tuning the rotation, but I always fail to get it just right predicting future collisions is unknown to me. I do not have the experience to accomplish such a task and searching the Web did not help either. I would appreciate any lines of code, guidance or help from the community. Thank you for your answers.p
Positive 8403 pGiven an arbitrary quaternion, codex, y, z, wcode, I need to modify it so that the rotation it causes along some chosen axis e.g. the yaxis is emreversedem.p  pSo, if a quaternion caused a rotation about the yaxis of 2 radians, Id like to modify the quaternion so it causes a rotation of 2 radians. Id like the rotations about the other two perpendicular axes to remain the same.p  pIve read some people suggesting to convert to Euler angles, then rotate flip the corresponding axis, then convert back to quaternions, but I dont think this would work at all. Ive also read others saying that you just flip codexcode, codeycode or codezcode corresponding to the axis you want to flip, and then also flip the codewcode  not too sure about that method either as it didnt work for basic tests.p  pA potential solution would seem to be using a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3684269componentofaquaternionrotationaroundanaxisthis questionanswera to get the rotation about a specific axis, and then reverse it by multiplying by an inverted quaternion of that rotation, but that seems a bit overkill. Maybe the problem is just more complex than Ive assumedp  pstrongEditstrong Im half way to a solution thanks to runevisions a hrefhttpstackoverflow.coma32482386993683answerap  blockquote   ul   liMirror effect of rotation along x axis by flipping y and z elements of the quaternion.li   liMirror effect of rotation along y axis by flipping x and z elements of the quaternion.li   liMirror effect of rotation along z axis by flipping x and y elements of the quaternion.li   ul      pThe w element of the quaternion never needs to be touched.p blockquote  pThis only allows use to use the cartesian axes as our mirroring axis, so its not actually a solution to this question, but it actually satisfies my requirements for now.p

I am using the following codep  precodeJanB for j212     if Jan,151         Jan,j0    end end codepre  pWhat I try to do in words, if for every row of column codeJancode is not equal to 1, than all values in the matrix from column 2 to 12 should be equal to 0.

Negative 8403 pis there a way in which i could create light grey text that disappears when a textbox is on focus p  pCurrently, i have text written in the textbox but i have to select the text and manually delete it somewhat annoying...p  pI know i can do something when i get focus on the box using events however, i dont want it to clear the text every time the user selects that box... rather just the first time. In other words, i just want the hint text to disappear not the text they enter if they were to select the box after typing in it once... p  pI also realize i could use something like a counter to keep track of if its the first time that box is being clicked on.. however, i was looking for a cleaner way to do this..... p
