Positive 5025 pI am currently trying to get Drupal to work on my Arch Linux system. Everything was going fine until I tried to install and configure the WYSIWYG editor timymce along with the WYSIWG module itself. I have placed the module in the correct folder i.e. sitesalllibraries and set the permissions to 755 for nonLinux guys, this is basically user  rwx, group  rx, other rx. It shows up on the WYSIWYG profile page  I can save it as Filtered HTML etc  but when I try to edit it, I am directed to the editing page, but the links to actually edit  i.e. the links e.g. Basic Set Up, Buttons and Plugins etc.  appear to be dead  I click on them and nothing happens. Also, the editor is not displaying when I click on add content. I dont get how I can select the actual editor on the WYSIWYG profile page, but cant edit the profile and the actual editor doesnt show.p  pI have looked all over the web for an answer  for example belowp  pa hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions16219303drupalwysiwygmenunotshowingDrupal wysiwyg menu not showingap  p...but nothing appears to be completely specific to my issue because I can select the editor but not edit it or see it when I try to edit a basic page.p  pI think it barely needs saying that I am a Drupal novice  in fact this is my first day with it  but I would very much appreciate any advice from a Drupal guru on how to get this going.

Negative 5025 pI encountered this weird bug in a c multithread program on linux. The multithreaded part basically executes a loop. One single iteration first loads a sift file containing some features. And then it queries these features against a tree. Since I have a lot of images, I used multiple threads to do this querying. Here is the code snippets.p  precodestruct MultiMatchParam      int threadid     float scores     double scoresd     int perm     sizet dbimagenum     stdvectorltstdstringgt queryfilenames     int startid     int numquery     int dim     VocabTree tree     FILE file    multithread will do normalization anyway void MultiMatchMultiMatchParam ampparam       Clear scores     forsizet t  param.startid t lt param.startid  param.numquery t              for sizet i  0 i lt param.dbimagenum i             param.scores[i]  0.0          DTYPE keys         int numkeys          keys  ReadKeyssfmparam.queryfilenames[t].cstr, param.dim, numkeys          int normalize  true         double mag  param.treegtMultiScoreQueryKeysnumkeys, normalize, keys, param.scores          delete [] keys       codepre  pI run this on a 8core cpu. At first it runs perfectly and the cpu usage is nearly 100 on all 8 cores. After each thread has queried several images about 20 images, all of a sudden the performance cpu usage drops drastically, down to about 30 across all eight cores.p  pI doubt the key to this bug is concerned with this line of code. p  precodedouble mag  param.treegtMultiScoreQueryKeysnumkeys, normalize, keys, param.scores codepre  pSince if I replace it with another costly operations e.g., a large forloop containing sqrt. The cpu usage is always nearly 100. This MultiScoreQueryKeys function does a complex operation on a tree. Since all eight cores may read the same tree no write operation to this tree, I wonder whether the read operation has some kind of blocking effect. But it shouldnt have this effect because I dont have write operations in this function. Also the operations in the loop are basically the same. If it were to block the cpu usage, it would happen in the first few iterations. If you need to see the details of this function or other part of this project, please let me know.p
