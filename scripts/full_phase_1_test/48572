Negative 48572 pemForewordem I am trying to describe the scenario very precisely here. The codeTLDRcode version is how do I tell if a lambda will be compiled into an instance method or a closure...p  pI am using MvvmLight in my WPF projects, and that library recently changed to using codeWeakReferencecode instances in order to hold the actions that are passed into a codeRelayCommandcode. So, effectively, we have an object somewhere which is holding a codeWeakReferencecode to an codeActionltTgtcode.p  pNow, since upgrading to the latest version, some of our commands stopped working. And we had some code like thisp  precodectorGuid token      Command  new RelayCommandx gt Messenger.Default.Sendx, token  codepre  pThis caused a closure please correct me if Im not using the correct term class to be generated  like thisp  precode[CompilerGenerated] private sealed class ltgtcDisplayClass4      public object token      public void lt.ctorgtb0ReportType x              Messenger.Default.SendltReportTypeSelectedgtnew ReportTypeSelectedX, this.token        codepre  pThis worked fine previously, as the action was stored within the codeRelayCommandcode instance, and was kept alive whether it was compiled to an instance method or a closure i.e. using the ltDisplayClass syntax.p  pHowever, now, because it is held in a codeWeakReferencecode, the code only works if the lambda specified is compiled into an instance method. This is because the closure class is instantiated, passed into the codeRelayCommandcode and virtually instantly garbage collected, meaning that when the command came to be used, there was no action to perform. So, the above code has to be modified. Changing it to the following causes that, for instancep  precodeGuid token ctorGuid token      token  token     Command  new RelayCommandx gt Messenger.Default.Sendx, token  codepre  pThis causes the compiled code to result in a member  like the followingp  precode[CompilerGenerated] private void lt.ctorgtb0ReportType x      Messenger.Default.SendltReportTypeSelectedgtnew ReportTypeSelectedX, this.token  codepre  pNow the above is all fine, and I understand why it didnt work previously, and how changing it caused it to work. However, what I am left with is something which means the code I write now has to be stylistically different based on a compiler decision which I am not privy to. p  pstrongSo, my question isstrong  is this a documented behaviour in all circumstances  or could the behaviour change based on future implementations of the compiler Should I just forget trying to use lambdas and always pass an instance method into the codeRelayCommandcode Or should I have a convention whereby the action is always cached into an instance memberp  precodeActionltReportTypeSelectedgt commandAction ctorGuid token      commandAction  x gt Messenger.Default.Sendx, token     Command  new RelayCommandcommandAction  codepre  pAny background reading pointers are also gratefully acceptedp

I can do the query by doing codestring.formatdl...code then using codereadsqlquerycode in pandas, but I read that this could lead to SQL injection and so isnt safe. p  pHowever, there doesnt seem to be a good alernative in SQLAlchemy. You cant seem to pass a list to the params using codetextcode, and converting the list into a string first leads to an error. I see that you can iterate over the list and pass the parameters one by one, but why would anyone want to do thatp  pWould cleaning up the variable removing quotes, semicolons, etc help reduce the risk of SQL injection Not being able to use a raw SQL string sounds like a terrible prospect.p
