It immediately responds with in this case a redirect command. The test has meanwhile a hrefhttpselenium.googlecode.comsvntrunkdocsapijavaorgopenqaseleniumWebElement.html relnofollowcontinued in the background as per the docsa due to the click being an AJAX event, and this results in as you can see the test retrieving the feedback 0.004 seconds before the server receives a new page request. By the time codefeedback.getTextcode has been parsed and sent to ChromeDriver, the server has already responded with a new page, and therefore this function returns the stale exception.p  pThe key point really is that I can fix this fine using codeThread.sleep1000code, but this is far from ideal firstly because there may be occasions where the server takes longer than half a second to parse the AJAX and return a result, and this makes the tests nondeterministic, and secondly because these times soon stack up and waste time, usually unnecessarily when only a few milliseconds was required.p
