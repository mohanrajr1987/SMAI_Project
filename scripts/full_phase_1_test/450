Positive 450 pI commonly use assertions in ObjectiveC where I want to assert a value. On a  debug build I assert in order to stop execution of the program and check if my assumption was incorrect. However, on production builds I find a way to fail safely in a way to minimise the user impact. I achieve this by creating a macro that encapsulates an NSAssert within an if statement which also executes the code I would like to run as a failsafe on production. For examplep  pAn assertion macro I would usep  precodedefine AssertTrueOrExecutecondition, action    if condition       NSAsserttestCondition, Condition failed      action     codepre  pSomewhere in my application I would have something like thisp  precode voidsomeMethod    BOOL testCondition  ...    Ensure the testCondition is true before proceeding any further   AssertTrueOrExecutetestCondition, return    Potentially unsafe code that never gets executed if testCondition is false    voidsomeReturningMethod    BOOL testCondition  ...    Ensure the testCondition is true before proceeding any further   AssertTrueOrExecutetestCondition, return safe string    Potentially unsafe code that never gets executed if testCondition is false  codepre  pSince I cannot define a macro like the one mention in Swift, is there a way to have the same behaviour That is how would I go about having a Swift equivalent for my codeAssertTrueOrExecutecode macro p  pstrongUpdatestrongp  pTo further explain the question, if I was using Swift I currently would write something like thisp  precodefunc someMethod       let testCondition  Bool  ...       Ensure the testCondition is true before proceeding any further     if testCondition        asserttestCondition       return           Potentially unsafe code that never gets executed if testCondition is false  codepre  pSo the question is more along the lines of how can the if statement with the assertions be wrapped in a similar way I have the ObjectiveC macro so that I can assert or return early for examplep  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pAnother example would be in function that returns something, for examplep  precodefunc someReturningMethod  gt String      let testCondition  Bool  ...       Ensure the testCondition is true before proceeding any further     if testCondition        asserttestCondition       return safe string               Potentially unsafe code that never gets executed if testCondition is false     return some other string  codepre

Negative 450 pA little background, we have a fairly large code base, which builds in to a set of libraries  which are then distributed for internal use in various binaries. At the moment, the build process for this is haphazard and everything is built off the trunk.p  pWe would like to explore whether there is a build system which will allow us to manage releases and automatically pull in dependencies. Such a tool exists for java, Maven. I like its package, repository and dependency mechanism, and I know that with either the mavennative or mavennar plugin we could get this. However the problem is that we cannot fix the source trees to the maven way  and unfortunately at least the mavennar plugins dont seem to like code that is not structured this way...p  pSo my question is, is there a tool which satisfies the following for Cp  ol libuildli lipackage for example libraries with all headers, something like the .narli liupload package to a repositoryli liautomatically pull in the required dependencies from said repository, extract headers and include in build, extract libraries and link.
