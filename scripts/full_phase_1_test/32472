Positive 32472 pI recently migrated a Windows Form Application C From Visual Studio 2008 to Visual Studio 2013.p  pThe problem is, the MainForm Design is shown as empty now, therefore I cant view or edit anything in it via the Gui. It basically shows the default Form when you create a new project.p  pIt still compiles and executes properly, the application itself still uses the Gui that I made, only within VS 2013 its missing.p  pHere are the images how it looks in VS 2008 and VS 2013, maybe someone can help me. I sadly cant post them directly, because I just recently registered.p  pVisual Studio 2008 p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.com3ZYdk.jpg altenter image description herep  pVisual Studio 2013 p  pimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.compmXAH.jpg altenter image description herep
Positive 32472 pSo i have this project that needs to print data from the database. I do this with a simple foreach loopp  precodepublic void LoadDatabase              connection.Open         dataAdapter.FilldataTable          try                      foreach DataRow row in dataTable.Rows                              Program.AnimalInfo.InfoIDListBox.Items.Addrow[AnimalID].ToString                               catch Exception ex                      MessageBox.ShowFailed to LoadDatabase  ex.Message                  connection.Close           codepre  pThe problem is that it will loop anywhere from 2 times to 6 times meaning that it prints everything at least twice. So at the moment my database contains AnimalIds id1 and id2. Now i get in my listbox 1, 2, 1, 2 or more depending on the amount of loops. I have no idea why this is happening and how to fix this.

Positive 32472 pMy simple webform program has a submit button that fires uneventfully in current versions of Firefox and Chrome, but does not fire in IE 11. Other programs in the same project have similar buttons that fire normally in all 3 browsers. I get no error messages, but running with breakpoints shows it never hits the .click sub.

All the AutoEventWireUp attributes are set to false, changed this one program to True per a suggestion on another site, but nada. ButtonIDs are correct. If I double click on the button in the .aspx to verify where it goes, it goes to the correct associated sub in the codebehind as it should. Ive deleted and recreated the button several times. A clear form button on the same page also doesnt work, so its not just this one button.p  pIve even tried it with everything commented out except just enough to run pageload and button sub, and it fails, but if I create the program from scratch again, with none of my real code, adding subs and functions, etc, back, one by one, it will work for a while, and eventually fail. Ive tried commenting out the most recently added sub or function, even all the way back to only pageload and button sub, but it still fails. Clearly something has been added but I dont know what would affect it to make it not work in IE but work in FF or Chrome.p  pAny ideas welcomed.p  pTIAbr Elainebr Ivy, VAp
Positive 32472 pI am developing an ActiveX control targeted at Windows CE 6 on a Motorola Workabout Pro 4, if specifying helps. I have stage one working, in the sense that I can compile in Visual Studio, and have deploy using a simple codeCABcode file.p  pHowever, I am finding it very hit and miss as to whether I can update the control on the device. If I perform a clean rebuild ensuring that all intermediary files are removed beforehand and redeploy the CAB file, I find that any changes arent reflected in the deployed code The output is unchanged, both in IE on the device, and when connecting and debugging via the Visual Studio 2008. Secondly, any breakpoints that I have added in the debugger no longer hit.p  pIf I manually replace the codedllcode file, this still has no effect. Even stranger, the control emstillem continues to work if I completely remove the codedllcodep  pIm a bit of a beginner when it comes to WinCE and ActiveX development, so any hints as to what I am missing here would be greatly appreciatedp
Positive 32472 pI am following this document  a hrefhttpcurl.haxx.selibcurlcvisualstudio.pdf relnofollowherea, in order to compile curl in visual studio 2008.
