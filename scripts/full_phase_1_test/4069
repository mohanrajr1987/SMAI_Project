Positive 4069 pwere using apache camel to read files from a directory and putting the content into a JMS Topic inside a Glassfish 4.1 server. Other software parts are reading from this JMS Topic and processing the content.p  pWere now having the problem, that the server runs for a time with an acceptable load, but after some hours the memory consumption is increasing and the Server starts swapping. At that point is the server out of control.p  pCan anybody give me a hint wich skrews JMS ConnectionFactory, ThreadPools etc. I have to turnp
Positive 4069 pI have a vendor software package where they offer a number of web services over HTTP.  The WSDLs defined for each of these services is SOAP 1.2 and has a binding with transport HTTP.  They also happen to have a number of local queues set up in an IBM WebSphere MQ queue manager and some of these queues will take a SOAP envelope for the same service.p  pThe vendor prefers because of the importance of the data that for reliability we communicate over MQ when possible.  Theoretically I dont see any reason that I couldnt have a client configured for SOAP over JMS to this queue specifically.p  pI have a copy of each WSDL that currently declare an HTTP transport binding, and I am using the JAXWS Maven plugin wsimport goal as part of my build process to use each of these WSDLs and generate SOAP proxy objects.  Rather than modify generated code, I use the convenient Spring codeJaxWsPortProxyFactoryBeancode class to dynamically change my endpoints at runtime and this works well for our project.p  pMy question is if there is also a way I can continue to use the codeJaxWsPortProxyFactoryBeancode but provide it a different Binding than what was generated, much like how I provide it a different endpointp  pIs it possible for me to set the binding to JMS transport type and then the endpoint can be a queue url p

Positive 4069 pWere building a system that will be sending messages from one application to another via JMS Using Websphere MQ if that matters. These messages are of the form Create x or Delete x. The end result of this is that a thirdparty system needs to be informed of the Create and Delete messages, so the Read end of the JMS queue is going to talk to the thirdparty system, whilst the Write end of the JMS queue is just broadcasting messages out to be handledp  pThe problem that were worried about here is if one of the messages fails. The initial thought here was simply to roll the failures back onto the JMS queue and let the normal retry mechanism handle it. That works until you get a Delete followed by a Create for the same identifier, e.g.p  ul liDelete 123  Fails, gets rolled back on to the queueli liCreate 123  Succeedsli liDelete 123  Retry from earlier failureli ul  pThe end result of this is that the third party was told to Create 123 and then immediately to Delete 123, instead of the other way around.p  pWhilst not ideal, from what Ive been reading up on it seems that Message Affinity would help here, so that we can guarantee that the messages are processed in the correct order. However, Im not sure how message affinity will work when messages are processed and failed back onto the queue Message Affinity is generally considered a bad idea, but the load here isnt going to be great, and the risk of poison messages is very low. Its simply the risk that the thirdparty that were interacting with has a brief outage that were concerned withp  pFailing that, are there any better thoughts on how to do this p  pEdit  Further complications. The system were building to integrate with the thirdparty is to replace a system they used from a different supplier until recently. As such, theres a bunch of data that is already in the thirdparty, but it turns out to be very difficult to actually get this out. The thirdparty doesnt even send successfailure messages back, merely an acknowledgement of receipt, so we dont actually know the initial state of the system. p
