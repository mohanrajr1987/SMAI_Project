Positive 77858 pI am building a semi automated lighting system which uses this script to turn it on i.e. a motor turns a mechanical dimmer for 1.2 seconds p  precodeusrbinenv python import RPi.GPIO as GPIO from time import sleep  GPIO.setmodeGPIO.BOARD  Motor1A  16 Motor1B  18 Motor1E  22  GPIO.setupMotor1A,GPIO.OUT GPIO.setupMotor1B,GPIO.OUT GPIO.setupMotor1E,GPIO.OUT  GPIO.outputMotor1A,GPIO.LOW GPIO.outputMotor1B,GPIO.HIGH GPIO.outputMotor1E,GPIO.HIGH  sleep1.2  GPIO.outputMotor1E,GPIO.LOW  GPIO.cleanup codepre  pI also have another two scripts which fade the lights up or down in increments of 0.15 seconds. Here is one of them p  precodeusrbinenv python import RPi.GPIO as GPIO from time import sleep  GPIO.setmodeGPIO.BOARD  Motor1A  16 Motor1B  18 Motor1E  22  GPIO.setupMotor1A,GPIO.OUT GPIO.setupMotor1B,GPIO.OUT GPIO.setupMotor1E,GPIO.OUT  GPIO.outputMotor1A,GPIO.LOW GPIO.outputMotor1B,GPIO.HIGH GPIO.outputMotor1E,GPIO.HIGH  sleep0.15  GPIO.outputMotor1E,GPIO.LOW  GPIO.cleanup codepre  pAssuming that the lights are faded either up or down prior to turning off I need a way of determing the light setting at that particular moment i.e. if the lights have been faded two stops for example then a script needs to reverse the motor for 0.9 seconds to return to zero.p  pIn an attempt to solve this I began to look at counters with the idea that if each 0.15 seconds increment represents the integer 1 for example then starting from the number 8 i.e. 8 x 0.15  1.2 the system when initially on I should be able to work out where I am at at any one time. p  pTo implement this I tried this script  p  precodeusrbinenv python from future import withstatement with opennum.txt,r as f     counter  strintf.read.strip1     f.seek0     f.writecounter codepre  pwhich works fine from the command line but wont run when I place it in the increment script above. p  pSo now I am a bit stuck and wondering if this is even the right direction anyway for solving the problem. Any help is much appreciated.p  pBtw the incremental script is triggered by pressing a button on a remote i.e. one button press  one increment.p

Positive 77858 pFor a project that I am doing I am trying to essentially convert an mp3 file into vibrations. I have talked to staff at SparkFun Electronics who set me up with the Lilypad Vibe Board and the Arduino Uno. It is in my understanding that with the Arduino Uno its unable to read an MP3 file and convert it into PWM so that the Lilypad Vibe Board can produce the vibrations. Does anyone know if there is any code or another device that will allow me to do this I have researched the Raspberry Pi but am also unsure as to if this will work in the way i would like it to work. Any help would be greatly appreciated. My aim is to take an mp3 file, convert it into PWM so that the Lilypad Vibe Board would be able to create the vibrations in relation to the mp3 file. p
