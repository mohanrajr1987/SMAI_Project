Positive 452 pSo I just recently learned recursion in programming, and so I was trying to build a function in swift that returns the factorial of the value assigned. just so you guys can get an idea, this is a code that does that but in Ruby.p  precodedef fatnum     if num1         return num     else         return numfatnum1     end end     pgets.toi     x  fatp     print x codepre  pI was trying to pretty much make the same code using swift but I realized there was an error right when I started codingp  precodefunc fat num Int     ifnum1     return num       codepre  pIt says line 3int is not convertible to  so I dont really understand whats going on here... Ive looked up and because this language is so new I couldnt find anything.p

Positive 452 pWhen I run this very simple recursive code, I found out that when the function recursCheck is using integer parameters my memory jumps to 200 MB in Win32 mode and 45 MB in x64 mode, and when the parameter is of type short the used memory is 4.7 MB Win32 mode and 1.7 MB for x64. sizeofint shows 4 bytes and sizeofshort shows 2 bytes. How is this possible  1 000 000 x 2 bytes  2 MB and 1 000 000 x 4 bytes  4 MB NOT 200 MB  strongemSo why this problem appersshort vs int and why Win32 mode takes less memory than x64emstrong Im using Visual Studio 2013, 64 bit OS Windows7, CPU i5, 4 GB RAM. The same issue happens in Visual Studio 2008, but there even more memory is taken  400 MB instead of 200 MB.p  precodeinclude stdafx.h include ltcstdlibgt include ltiostreamgt define SIZETT 1000000 using namespace std  void recursCheckint i  int main      cout ltlt sizeofint ltlt endl     int i  SIZETT     recursChecki      systemPAUSE     return 0   void recursCheckint i      cout ltlt i ltlt endl     if i  0              recursChecki          else              systemPAUSE       codepre  pWin32 MODE WITH i of type int a hrefhttppostimg.orgimage80bcc8gyp relnofollowimage 1a Win32 MODE WITH i of type short a hrefhttppostimg.orgimage3k4r4c8s5 relnofollowimage 2ap  pI also found out that before the second systemPAUSE before the end of the main program the memory IS STILL in use. I know C doesncodet manage memory, but shouldncodet when all recursCheck functions end the token memory be freed I lose the point of LOCAL variable. How you see the parameter is passed BY VALUE. SHOULDNT IT BE FREED AFTER FUNCTION END AUTOMATICALLYp
Positive 452 h2Situationh2  pI am in a situation where I will have a lot of numbers around about 0  15. The vast majority are whole numbers, but very few will have decimal values.
