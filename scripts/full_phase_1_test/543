Positive 543 pI have a list of strings where I need to count the number of list entries that have an occurances of a specific string inside of them and the whole thing only for a subset of the list not the whole list.p  pThe code below works quite well BUT its performance is.....sadly not in an acceptable niveau as I need to parse through 500k to 900k list entries.For these entries I need to run the code below about 10k times as I have 10k parts of the list I need to analyse.

Positive 543 pI have been working on shooting method to do an optimization of 1 degree of freedom pendulum. All the initial conditions for position and velocity, duration of motion and mechanical design parameters are already specified. The only controls torques are unknown.

Positive 543 pIve got some code that is using codesharedptrcode quite widely as the standard way to refer to a particular type of object lets call it codeTcode in my app.  Ive tried to be careful to use codemakesharedcode and codestdmovecode and codeconst Tampcode where I can for efficiency.  Nevertheless, my code spends a great deal of time passing codesharedptrcodes around the object Im wrapping in codesharedptrcode is the central object of the whole caboodle.  The kicker is that pretty often the codesharedptrcodes are pointing to an object that is used as a marker for no value this object is a global instance of a particular codeTcode subclass, and it lives forever since its refcount never goes to zero.p  pUsing a no value object is nice because it responds in nice ways to various methods that get sent to these objects, behaving in the way that I want no value to behave.  However, performance metrics indicate that a huge amount of the time in my code is spent incrementing and decrementing the refcount of that global singleton object, making new codesharedptrcodes that refer to it and then destroying them.  To wit for a simple test case, the execution time went from 9.33 seconds to 7.35 seconds if I stuck codenullptrcode inside the codesharedptrcodes to indicate no value, instead of making them point to the global singleton codeTcode no value object.  Thats a hugely important difference run on much larger problems, this code will soon be used to do multiday runs on computing clusters.  So I really need that speedup.  But Id really like to have my no value object, too, so that I dont have to put checks for codenullptrcode all over my code, specialcasing that possibility.p  pSo.  Is there a way to have my cake and eat it too  In particular, Im imagining that I might somehow subclass codesharedptrcode to make a sharedimmortalptr class that I could use with the no value object.  The subclass would act just like a normal codesharedptrcode, but it would simply never increment or decrement its refcount, and would skip all related bookkeeping.  Is such a thing possiblep  pIm also considering making an inline function that would do a codegetcode on my codesharedptrcodes and would substitute a pointer to the singleton immortal object if codegetcode returned codenullptrcode if I used that everywhere in my code, and never used codecode or codegtcode directly on my codesharedptrcodes, I would be insulated, I suppose.p  pOr is there another good solution for this situation that hasnt occurred to mep

Negative 543 pWhy I would want to followsp  pIm working on a site that is pretty 1998. Its distributed into frames. A lot of hands that never RTFMd before using the templating language have touched it and most of the jhtml files read more like lists of servlets with a dash of logic than HTML templates with a dash of templating tags for dynamic repetition of elements and insertions of dynamic values.p  pIts a pretty inflexible tightly coupled spaghetti monster of an app, especially from a front end devs perspective.p  pIm very fond of Djangos approach to the problem and would like to take a crack at building something like its URI config file which basically maps regEx URI patterns to controllers passing in captured parameters is where that gets really useful which in turn load up template files and plugs in the business logic to render the appropriate page.p  pIm new to Java but Im assuming Id be writing servlets to handle this.p

Negative 543 pForgive me, guys. I am at embestem a novice when it comes to Ruby. Im just curious to know the explanation for what seems like pretty odd behavior to me.p  pIm using the a hrefhttpsavonrb.comSavona library to interact with a SOAP service in my Ruby app. What I noticed is that the following code in a class Ive written to handle this interaction seems to pass strongempty valuesstrong where I expect the values of member fields to gop  precodecreatesessionresponse  client.request createSession do   soap.body       user gt user,  This ends up being empty in the SOAP request,     pass gt pass   as does this.    end codepre  pThis is despite the fact that both codeusercode and codepasscode have been initialized as nonempty strings.p  pWhen I change the code to use locals instead, it works the way I expectp  precodeuser  user pass  pass  createsessionresponse  client.request createSession do   soap.body       user gt user,  Now this has the value I expect in the SOAP request,     pass gt pass   and this does too.    end codepre  pIm guessing this strange to me behavior must have something to do with the fact that Im inside a block but really, I have no clue.
