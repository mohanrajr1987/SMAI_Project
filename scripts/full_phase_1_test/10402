Positive 10402 pI need to use a .cpp file which contains codeinclude ltunorderedmapgtcode in a Qt project Based on Qt 5.4.2 Clang 6.0 Apple, 64 bit.

I had checked the path of the folder where codeunorderedmapcode header file locates is the same as codeltalgorithmgtcode,  codeltutilitygtcode, codeltiostreamgtcode, and codeltsstreamgtcode which are included in the beginning of the same .cpp file.

Positive 10402 pSo I think what I am trying to do is just impossible in GCC due to macro expansion having to result in a preprocessor token. This works fine in MSVC for what it is worth but I can not find a comparablep  pSo I think this is impossible in GCC Works fine in VC due to macro expansion having to be preprocessor tokens and what is considered a separator between the tokens.p  pI am attempting to link in a specific version of a library, in this example it is Lua 5.3.1. I have the files in extracted to my source folder so that they can be found in the sub folder lua5.3.1src and I would like to write a macro that I can use to prefix the header files with that path. Something simple like codeLUAPATHfilecode that would expand into codelua5.3.1srcfilecode. Normally I would just use the compiler flags to give a different subfolder to search through but due to how the projects I am working on are set up, that is exactly what I can not do and what I am trying to find another way around having to maintain the include paths all over the place.p  pHere is the little file I wrote that does not compile, but I can run it through cpp to see what it gives mep  precodedefine LUASRC lua5.3.1src define STRINGIFYs s define ADDLUAPATHpath, file STRINGIFYpath  file define EVALUATORpath, file ADDLUAPATHpath,file define LUAPATHfile EVALUATORLUASRC,file  void main void          OUTPUTOFMACROHERE gt LUAPATHlua.h  codepre  pThis gives me the following output from running cpp on the filep  precode cpp temp.c  1 temp.c  1 ltcommandlinegt  1 usrincludestdcpredef.h 1 3 4  1 ltcommandlinegt 2  1 temp.c void main void  temp.c129 error pasting  and lua does not give a valid preprocessing token  define LUASRC lua5.3.1src                               temp.c344 note in definition of macro ADDLUAPATH  define ADDLUAPATHpath, file STRINGIFYpath  file                                              temp.c525 note in expansion of macro EVALUATOR  define LUAPATHfile EVALUATORLUASRC,file                           temp.c535 note in expansion of macro LUASRC  define LUAPATHfile EVALUATORLUASRC,file                                     temp.c923 note in expansion of macro LUAPATH   OUTPUTOFMACROHERE gt LUAPATHlua.h                          OUTPUTOFMACROHERE gt lua5.3.1srclua.h  codepre  pThe truly frustration part of this is that the second from last line is exactly the output I am trying to get. It is just that GCC considers getting there an error.p  pThe issue is the  character at the end of the path. If you take the  out at the end of the LUASRC definition and run it you get codeOUTPUTOFMACROHERE gt lua5.3.1srclua.hcode with out any error.. except that the path is invalid. I can not find a place to put the character anywhere to get it into the output quoted string. I have tried adding it in on its own like codepath    filecode or moving it to the value passed in like codeLUAPATHlua.hcode. This just complains about what is being combined with it src or lua as an invalid preprocessor token.p  pI have tried just using the strings for the preprocessor to concatenate but codeinclude string stringcode just seems to try and include both of those strings as separate paths. Clearly a folder can not be opened and the exact file can not be found with out searching sub folders. This has also been the result of having half of the variables the path or the file to be a string to be added to the other expanded and stringified value. It also is the result of simply trying to prefix my files with the path to be expanded codeinclude LUASRClua.hcode GCC documentation said if it does not find a lt or a  it considers the value for macro expansionp  pIs there another strategy to get it to like the  in a macro definition that I am missing Would love to know.p  pFor what its worth I am using gcc version 4.8.2 Ubuntu 4.8.219ubuntu1p  pEDIT The logic to actually do it but more important the reasons Not to do this are provided in the link of the answer marked below.

Positive 10402 h1The goalh1  pIm looking for a markup language for writing documentation that would support a very flexible codeINCLUDEcodelike directive that can target specific elements of an included file or resource. The markup language should also have some LaTeX and ideally also HTML exporter. However, the elements should be included from the file as they are without any additional tagging of the elements. p  pOne additional requirement is to be able to use LaTeX math fragments as this is to be used in academia.p  h2Example usageh2  pFor example, I may have several documents about specific components of a device and one day I decide I want to create a report about certain aspects of certain components. Using this codeINCLUDEcodelike directive I would include the paragraphsresourcesnodes from the various documents and then export it to PDF through LaTeX.p  h1Research so farh1  pIve had a look at most of the common markup and even nonmarkup languages and most do have something like and codeINCLUDEcode directive, but usually its only capable of including whole files or at best a range of lines from a file. However, line ranges are very brittle and may become quickly obsolete if the included document is e.g. extended.p  pHere I list some of the most promising candidatesp  h2EMACS Orgmodeh2  pIve been playing around with the newly extended codeINCLUDEcode directive a hrefhttporgmode.orgChanges.htmlorgheadline21 relnofollowfunctionality in Orgmode version 8.3 for extracting parts of filesa, documented a hrefhttporgmode.orgmanualIncludefiles.html relnofollowin the manuala and an example is a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions25895721orgmodeincludeheadingin the answer of this questiona.p  precodeINCLUDE .otherfile.orgHeadline text codepre  h2LaTeXh2  pThe closest alternative I found in LaTeX is a hrefhttpswww.ctan.orgpkgcatchfilebetweentags relnofollowcatchfilebetweentagsa, but that requires adding the tags in the file being included. p  pIve also seen people use codedefresourceIDresource contentcode to define the nodes in files and then include the files where needed and expand the required macros.

Negative 10402 pI always think we should use namespace after includes, for example, we should usep  precodeinclude ltvectorgt using stdvector  codepre  pinstead ofp  precodeusing stdvector include ltvectorgt codepre  pbut I find the second one is OK, what confuses me is that different ordering of them causes different results.See following simple example here are two header files and one c file.p  precode test1.h include ltvectorgt  using stdvector include test2.h   test2.h vectorltintgt v   test.cpp include test1.h  int main      return 0  codepre  pAlthough test2.h doesnt include vector, but it compiles OK all above.  Whats strange is when I swap the order of using stdvector and include , there happens a compile error like thisp  perror C2143 syntax error  missing  before ltp  perror C2501 vector  missing storageclass or type specifiersp  perror C2143 syntax error  missing  before ltp  perror C2874 usingdeclaration causes a multiple declaration of vectorp  pI do not understand the internals, does the order of namespace and includes really matter why so thisp
