Positive 6061 pI have a fullfledged Java EE project running on GlassFish 4.1  Java EE 7 NetBeans 8.0.2 not using Apache Maven.p  pDepending upon the project functionality, the CDI dependency has to be added to both the projectsmodules namely the EE module and the Web module and a class library, if any.p  pI have been confusing for a long time seeing people recommending to add either Java EE 7 API Library or Java EE Web 7 API Library to the compiletime classpath as a CDI dependency these libraries are bundled in NetBeans and readily available out of the box, when using NetBeans.p  pSince these libraries contain a collection of APIs possibly the entire Java EE stack starting from the Servlet API, adding one of these libraries to the compiletime classpath especially in the EE project does not make sense, when the CDI functionality is needed in Java EE applications.p  pWhy is it suggested many a times especially in NetBeans projects to add one of these libraries, when only codecdiapi.jarcode as a CDI dependency is sufficientp  psubI do not find a canonical answer on this site nor somewhere else as to which library exactly is to be added in NetBeans projects, when the CDI functionality is required in Java EE applications. Adding only codecdiapi.jarcode goes fine, by the way.subp

Negative 6061 pIm trying to make a feature in a product which gives the user the ability to split a textview into two. The way this is done is by removing the textview from its superview, making a NSSplitView and adding the textview as well as a new NSTextView instance to this splitview. Lastly I make these two textviews share the same textstorage in order to make them share the same content.p  pIt works great. But the problem is when I want to make one of the two textviews change textstorage. The replaceTextStorage method in NSLayoutManager causes both NSTextView to change textStorage. The API documentation statesp  blockquote   pstrongreplaceTextStoragestrong All   NSLayoutManager objects sharing the   original NSTextStorage object then   share the new one. This method makes   all the adjustments necessary to keep   these relationships intact, unlike   setTextStorage.p blockquote  pSo it makes sense that it would do this. But the question is how do I make it possible to have two or more textviews first share the same storage and after that having them using their ownp  pIve tried replacing the layoutManager and even making new instances of NSTextViews but no luck...p  pAny suggestionsp
