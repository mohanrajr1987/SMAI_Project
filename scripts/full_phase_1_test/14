Positive 14 pHeres a link to lis.py if youre unfamiliar a hrefhttpnorvig.comlispy.html relnofollowhttpnorvig.comlispy.htmlap  pIm trying to implement a tiny lisp interpreter in Go. Ive been inspired by Peter Norvigs Lis.py lisp implementation in Python.p  pMy problem is I cant think of a single somewhat efficient way to parse the sexpressions. I had thought of a counter that would increment by 1 when it sees a  and that would decrement when it sees a . This way when the counter is 0 you know youve got a complete expression.p  pBut the problem with that is that it means you have to loop for every single expression which would make the interpreter incredibly slow for any large program.p  pAny alternative ideas would be great because I cant think of any better way.p

Negative 14 pThis certainly is a strange one...p  pI have an ASP.net 4.0, C website that has a login page using FormsAuthentication to handle user access.  Theres also code throughout the site that boots the user back to the login page whenever a session times out or something else that requires them to login again happens.  This is all really basic stuff that Ive done about a dozen times before.p  pI know this whole process is working, because Ive been able to login to the site running through VS2010 on EVERY browser I tried.  It also works perfectly fine when its sitting on the development server using Chrome, Firefox, Safari Mac, and two Cellphone browsers.  The only thing Ive had a problem with is Internet Explorer.p  pNow, this one is a bit hard to debug considering it works in IE locally but not on the server.  The fact that it also works in other browsers on the server is also sort of ruling out a server configuration issue.p  pWhat I did to try and figure out where it could be going wrong was add a query string to my FormsAuthentication.RedirectToLoginWhateverPageWhateverSectionOfCode line to try and solve this.  The problem is that when I run the site in IE, it never appends that Query String, which leads me to believe that it never hits any of those RedirectToLogin lines.p  pI know it authenticates, because the code that updates the Last Login timestamp in the database only fires if the user is authenticated.  It looks as if the RedirectFromLogin line does go out and find the proper entry in the web.config...and it might actually be redirecting me, but even if it does, it always bounces me back to the login screen.p  pIve been through all of the really basic ID10T errors heh that could possibly be causing this Heightened security settings, disabled cookies, etc., but Im getting the same results on multiple machines.p  pIm really sort of stumped as to what to check for next.  Ive already had two other sets of eyes on the code, but they couldnt come up with any reason as to why this was happening.  If anyone has any suggestions as to what could be happening, Id love to hear them.p  pThanksp
