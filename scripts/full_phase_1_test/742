Positive 742 pI have created an Azure Web App today and it has a Mobile section in the Settings which contains Push notification, Mobile Authentication, etc. You can even download the source code for a mobile client app. I know that this used to be part of Mobile App Mobile Service. I have created an Azure Mobile App to compare with Web App and they look the same in terms of Settings and Tools. Even the Icon is the same.p  pMy question is what is what is the difference between Azure Web App and Azure Mobile Appp
Positive 742 pI am using jPlayer for a website plugin that plays MP3 files which are transmitted from a Server. When you include the main script in a website a button is added to the DOM structure that allows the user to open the player. When this button is clicked the structure of the player buttons for playpause, back, forward, stop is added by createElement and appendChild. Also an instance of a second script called playback will be included. This script manages the state of the player. Clicks on the player buttons call functions in the playback script.p  pNow when you press play for the very first time, the jPlayer object will be initialized, before finally the function playCurrent is called to play the current MP3 file in the queue.p  pThe initialization of the jPlayer objectp  precodejQueryplayerID.jPlayer         swfPath scriptPath  jquery.jplayer.swf,         ready function              if stoppedByError                   move the cursor to part 0 and play it                 if singleStringMode                      moveCursor0                                     console.logFIRST START                  update the player status                 setPlayerStatus1                  play the current text part                 playCurrent                      ,         ended functionevent              if stoppedByError                  self.goToNext                      ,         errorAlerts false,         supplied mp3,         error functionevent              if stoppedByError                  handlePlayerError                        codepre  pThe code to start the playback in the function playCurrentp  precodejQueryplayerID.jPlayersetMedia,      mp3 textParts[currentPart].mp3     ogg sample.ogg .jPlayerplay codepre  pOf course the assigned URL of the MP3 textParts[currentPart].mp3 is checked before this code to make sure the MP3 has successfully been transmitted from the server.p  pAll of this works fine on desktop PCs in Chrome, Firefox and newer versions of IE. However, on some mobile devices iOS, Android there is a strange bug When you press the play button for the first time, it changes to a pause button, but the playback does not start. Only when you press the button two more times once to pause the playback and one more time to start it again, everything works as in desktop browsers.p  pI am aware that jPlayers autoplay generally does not work on mobile devices, so this option is just turned off on mobile. But I can not find any good explanation why the playback fails at the first attempt. I used jConsole for mobile debugging and there wasnt any error. One thing that I tried was to assign some silent dummy MP3 file to the jPlayer instance in the ready function to really make sure that some audio is available when the player is started for the first time, but it didnt help either.p  pThis doesnt seem to be a general problem of jPlayer as I tested the demo sites for MP3 playback on the same devices and it works just fine. What is also very odd that the problem does not apply to Windows Mobile, just iOS and Android.p  pAny suggestions what could go wrong in the process of initializing jPlayer and starting it for the first timep

The checkNewDay method is where the condition is tested and action taken if the day had changedp  precodebool NoteOfDayFactorycheckNewDay      stdcout ltlt Checking for new day every minute or so ltlt stdendl     stdcout ltlt Before incrementing ltlt stdendl     forint i  0 i lt 100000 i     counter     stdcout ltlt counter ltlt  minutes elapsed ltlt stdendl     return true  codepre  pI put the small test code, presented above, before I used the real action, to test if everything goes well and the checkNewDay isnt called more than once every minute. What I found puzzle me. After every minute elapses I get a number of let say 10 messages at least printed on the stdout but the variable increases only once every minute.p  pstrongstrong snip p  pChecking for new day every minute or sop  pBefore incrementingp  p1 minutes elapsedp  pChecking for new day every minute or sop  pBefore incrementingp  p1minutes elapsedp  pstrong snip strongp  pChecking for new day every minute or sop  pBefore incrementingp  p2 minutes elapsedp  pChecking for new day every minute or sop  pBefore incrementingp  p2 minutes elapsedp  pstrong snip strongp  pIt behaves like the text was sent to 10 or so different buffers and printed out at once after every minute.

Negative 742 pI got into the habit of declaring codeforcode loop indices with codesizetcode instead of codeintcode. That however already bid me multiple times when I was iterating an array backwards, i.e. checking for the index to be greater or equal to zerop  precodefor sizet i  n1 i gt 0 i       ...  codepre  pWhen the body has been run for codei  0code, it gets decremented and wraps around, to codeSIZETMAXcode probably. That makes the break condition a tautology. There might be some clever bit manipulations to check for possible underflows, but wouldnt it be simpler to use codeptrdifftcode insteadp  pWhat is the proper idiomatic C way to solve this codesizetcode plus bit twiddling or codeptrdifftcode and feeling uncomfortable about semanticsp

Negative 742 pIm downloading a long list of my email subject lines , with the intent of finding email lists that I was a member of years ago, and would want to purge them from my Gmail account which is getting pretty slow.p  pIm specifically thinking of newsletters that often come from the same address, and repeat the productservicegroups name in the subject.p  pIm aware that I could searchsort by the common occurrence of items from a particular email address and I intend to, but Id like to correlate that data with repeating subject lines....p  pNow, many subject lines would fail a string match, but  Google Friends  Our latest news Google Friends  What were doing today are more similar to each other than a random subject line, as is Virgin Airlines has a great sale today Take a flight with Virgin Airlinesp  pSo  how can I start to automagically extract trendsexamples of strings that may be more similar. p  pApproaches Ive considered and discarded because there must be some better wayp  ul liExtracting all the possible substrings and ordering them by how often they show up, and manually selecting relevant onesli liStripping off the first word or two and then count the occurrence of each sub stringli liComparing Levenshtein distance between entriesli liSome sort of string similarity index ...li ul  pMost of these were rejected for massive inefficiency or likelyhood of a vast amount of manual intervention required.
