Negative 2175 pThe Problem Two developers  three opinions on indention, braces on new line or not etc.p  pWe usually work with three or four people on our projects and each of those has its own code style. I know, the common solution is to agree on a code style, everybody has to use, but I dont want to force creative programmers in a suit that does not fit them.p  pSo the question is Is there a way to let each programmer live hisher own style, but having a common code base inside the repository I think of some gitsvnwhatever plugin, which changes between personal and common style on checkout and commit.

Negative 2175 pI am developing an application in nodeJS which uses socket.io for interactive gameplay. Inside the socket.onconnection callback block, I have declared several variables. From what I can tell, these variables are connectionspecific and there will be an instance for each callback fired on a socket connection for each client.p  pDuring my tests, I tried in two browsers and was able to play two independent game sessions at the same time which lead me to confirm this view of those variables.p  pHowever, when in a more live environment, I was noticing other players actions appearing as actions on my screen. I dont use broadcast anywhere, just simple emits inside the connection block, so I am perplexed why I see this happening.p  pIs my assumption about connectionspecific variables incorrect Or is there a more subtle applicationspecific reason this might be happeningp
