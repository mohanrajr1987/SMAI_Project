Positive 39464 pFirst off, apologies for the unusual  hard to read title  I couldnt think of a simple way to explain the issue Im having.p  pBare with me and hopefully this will make some sense  its a very localised issue Im having with CK Editor and the plugin Track Changes by the company Loop Index  a hrefhttpsgithub.comloopindexckeditortrackchanges relnofollowPluginap  pSo the problem is triggered when we have a few paragraphs of data and we try to delete the content from midway inside the paragraph. Its probably easier to demonstrate so, take the Lorem Ipsum below.p  blockquote   pLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Mauris sit   amet orci nec eros tempus auctor. strongemSuspendisse viverra tellus vel   magna interdum, et vestibulum nisl eleifend. Sed a sagittis magna, vel   ornare purus.emstrong Nullam vel odio nibh. Pellentesque sodales vitae   ipsum eu aliquam. Morbi viverra nec neque a aliquet. Sed mattis luctus   volutpat.p blockquote  pIf I was to delete this, when trying to track changes. It would remove the text as expected, but it also inserts the text Deleted by Our User within CK Editor as real text I.E it is viewablep  pI think the reason this happens is because CK Editor tool tips are inserted into the DOM. When we hover over the text we show the tooltip Which inserts mark up onto CK Editor and then when we click delete it removes the text lipsum but leaves in the tooltip text within the editor.p  pI know this is an extremely localised issue and will probably get deleted as such, but I thought it was worth a shot to see if anyone has had this issue.p  p Version of CK Editor is 4.4.7 and for the Loop Index plugin is 1.1.30p
Negative 39464 pI suppose kinect standard way of usage is to put this device in some fixed position and let it do its calculation e.g. head tracking of someone which moves in front it.p  pBut my use case is different. What I need to do is change the frame of reference  attach kinect to the head and start moving with it around the room. Then I need to calculate its position within the room I have the room already mapped into memory.p  pSo tracking should be now based on current device position itself and its relation with the room walls, floor and ceiling. As I understand kinect should be able to reflect light from the walls and give the deph  of what is my current distance from the wall etc. I need to get some information if this is even possible to achieve.p  pCan you provide me some constructive references, where I could go much deeper into the topic, for being able to start the implementation of desired behaviour then p

Negative 39464 pSo a little bit of background might be useful. I have a small javascript snippet that runs on third party sites that when the end user clicks a button loads and iframe onto the page. Inside this iframe users can fill out a form that submits an AJAX request to a webserver of mine. p  pAfter the user submits the form they can close the iframe visibly and I remove the iframe element from the DOM on the third party site. What happens to inflight AJAX requests inside the iframe if it is removed from the DOM on the third party site Do they completep  pIf people are unsure could people suggest possible ways of reliably testing this.p

The algorithm depends on remainder r to proceed further.I basically formed the idea that for a number, its factors gives us the sides of the rectangles whose area is the number itself. For all other numbers which are not factors there would be a remainder left, or consequently the rectangle cannot be formed in complete. Thus idea is for each decrease of mL, we can increase r  mRr basically shifting one mR from mRmL to r and then this large r is divided by mL to see how much we can increase mR how many times we can increase mR for one decrease of mL. Thus remaining r is r mod mL. I have calculated the number of while loop it takes to find the factors and it comes below or equal 5N for all numbers. Trial division will take more.p  pThanks for your time, a hrefhttprandomoneness.blogspot.com201109algorithmtofindfactorsorprimesin.html relnofollowHarisha p
