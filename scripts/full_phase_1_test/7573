Negative 7573 pOur code calls codestringWithUTF8Stringcode but some data we have uses an codeoctalcode sequence 340 in the string. This causes some code to break because we never expect the function to return codenilcode. I did some research and found that any octal sequence from 200777 will give the same result. I know I can handle this returning codenilcode but I want to understand why it would return codenilcode, and what those octal escapes are interpreted as.p  precodeNSString result  [NSString stringWithUTF8StringMfile 340 xyz.jpg] codepre  prunning this code return codenilcode for result. It appears that to code defensively we will have to check null results for this everywhere where we use it which seems unfortunate. The documentation for the function does not say anything about returning nil as a possibility. I would bet that there is a lot of code out there that does not check for it either. p
