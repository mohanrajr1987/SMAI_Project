Negative 2218 pI would like to know how to create view which also works even if the foreign key strongis NULLstrong. For example we have table strongPersonstrong which has a primary key and two foreign keysp  ul liIdPersonli liFkNameli liFkSurnameli ul  pBoth foreign keys strongcan be NULLstrong. Now we also have two tables, table strongNamestrongp  ul liIdNameli liNameli ul  pAnd table strongSurnamestrongp  ul liIdSurnameli liSurnameli ul  pNow we create view to display name and surname for each Personp  precodeCREATE VIEW Database.ViewPerson AS  SELECT N.Name, S.Surname FROM Person P, Name N, Surname S WHERE P.FkName  N.IdName AND P.FkSurname  S.IdSurname codepre  pThe problem is, if the foreign key FkSurname is NULL, than that row will not be displayed even though FkName is defined. I want that even if both foreign keys are NULL it still returns row where both columns are NULL. Now I know that I could solve it by adding in table Name and in table Surname row, that has NULL under NameSurname and then in the FkName and FkSurname reference a row that has NULL values under those two columns. But I would still like to find out if there is a solution where foreign key is NULL and the row is returned.p
Negative 2218 por at least I think thats the method I need to use. In my class we are learning graphics, but my professor said we couldnt handle the full extent of java graphics just yet so were using this custom class that was written by somebody called DrawingPanel. I downloaded DrawingPanel.java, my question is how do I get it so that I can import it to be used in my code. So far Ive tried just setting my classpath to the folder it and the .class file are in and typing import DrawingPanel but that didnt work, nor did turning it into a jar file and setting the classpath in manifest to java.awt.jar. and then importing java.awt. but that was just a long shot that I didnt expect to work because I have no clue how the manifest.MF works. Can anyone help edit also Im on linuxp
