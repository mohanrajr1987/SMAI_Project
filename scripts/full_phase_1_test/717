Positive 717 pI have around fivehundred 23M files of data that I am trying to sort into one database. I have sorted them all individually using codesortcode, and am now trying to merge them using codesort mergecode, so that the whole sample is sorted together. Then I plan to split them up into fivehundred files again.p  pThe issue I am running into is that my drive is very congested, and I only have about 805GB available according to codedfcode. When I run codesort merge file1 file2 file3...code I eventually receive an error that sort has failed due to no more space left on the drive.p  pAre there any tips for how I could work around or solve this issue, or is the only solution to free up more spacep

Manytomany joins form the Cartesian product of the rows.

Negative 717 pIm attempting to operate JDB programmatically. Unlike any sane debugger, JDB refers to the source code using class names instead of source file names. Im assuming its related to having the bytecode stored in multiple .class files instead of a single fileyou would expect compilation with the codegcode flag to produce some reference to the source files, but making things easy is not the Java way...p  pWhen JDB refers to classes I can usually do some string manipulations and look at the source file names to figure out which source file declares the relevant class. When I need to supply a class name for a breakpoint, I can read the file to get the package name, use the file name as the class name and generate the full class name that way. These two cases I got them working.p  pThe problem starts with inner classes and anonymous classes. They reside in their own class files, and their names are mangled versions of the class that contains them. To set a breakpoint there I need the mangled name.p  pFor example  this is codeMain.javacodeline numbersp  precode1 public class Main 2    public static void mainString[] args 3        new Object 4            Override public String toString 5                System.out.printlnhi 6                return  7             8        .toString 9     10 codepre  pI compile it using codejavac g Main.javacode and got codeMain.classcode and codeMain1.classcode.

Trying to syntactically analyze the source file and figure out which is what is too complex a task  there ought to be a simpler way.p  pMaybe extract that information from the .class files, or question JDB about it, or even make JDB use source file names like any sane debugger for any sane language...p

Negative 717 pIm trying to write a server in C, with IO nonblocking because sometimes it goes down for flood requests. Looking around, Ive notice that IO nonblocking can solve my problem. Reading the Beej guide, Ive implemented the recvtimeout function, that set a timeout to handle data from a client. People told me I have to use the strongselectstrong to avoid this problem, but I used it already in the function recvtimeoutp  precodeint Serverrecvtimeoutint s, char buf, int len, int timeout           Check if nonblocking     fcntls, FSETFL, ONONBLOCK int flags  fcntls, FGETFD if flags amp ONONBLOCK  ONONBLOCK    fprintfstderr, nonblocking active  else    fprintfstderr, nonblocking not active      End check  fdset fds int n struct timeval tv  set up the file descriptor set FDZEROampfds FDSETs, ampfds  set up the struct timeval for the timeout tv.tvsec  timeout tv.tvusec  0  wait until timeout or data received n  selects1, ampfds, NULL, NULL, amptv if n  0     return 2  timeout  if n  1     return 1  error   data must be here, so do a normal recv return recvs, buf, len, 0      codepre  pSo, Ive added a piece of code that show me if NONBLOCK is set or not, but never I read emnonblocking activeem, so in my code nonblocking is not active. How can I mod my code to enable thisp  pThe problem is when I read a string from a client and have a code like thisp  precode        char headerstring[512]     memsetheaderstring,0,512     ifthisgtrecvtimeoutclientfd,headerstring,sizeofheaderstring,10 lt 0         closeclientfd      codepre  pAll works fine, but with a flooder that close the connection during the transaction, the server goes down. Ive tried trycatch and any other things...but nothing.p
Negative 717 pI have to use some WordPress shortcodes for a project  but I want them in very specific places, and not in the main content.

EDIT  below using codegetfieldscode gets me closer... p  pbrbr THEN... with a more complex shortcodep  precodeltphp echo doshortcode [tflistview imagesizemedium1 excludecalendarlink,listviewtitle dateformatD n.j]  gt codepre  pIt breaks somethings like the image by adding codecode  which could totally be the way the shortcode was written  but basically  I havent found a solution to using a shortcode in a custom field like this.p  pbr Bottom line, p  pId like to write codeltphp shitoutmyannoyingshortcode gtcodep  pOr something as close to that as possible. AND have it actually work.p  pCan anyone give me some more directionp
