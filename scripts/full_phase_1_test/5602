Positive 5602 pI have an assignment which is to make a turing machine. In essence I have a node class and a tape class where all the nodes go and have to make a double linked list. Im trying but Im really struggling when I have to make the pointer to the objects.p  pI have a dummy which is a dummy node that I insert every time the machine goes left or right. And a pointer which keeps track of where I am on the program.p  pThis is the codemoveRightcode methodp  precodepublic void moveRight   Get cell to the right, create one if  null      if pointer.next  null           dummy  new Cell          record.addrecord.size, dummy          dummy.prev  pointer          pointer.next  dummy          pointer  dummy           else          pointer  pointer.next       codepre  pThe problem is in the pointer. In the end when I say codepointer  dummycode. If I make any changes to the pointer, dummy also changes, therefore the entire list is screwed. In python there was a way to copy a list like codeListCopy  List[]code. I just need the pointer to point to a copy of dummy. Whats the easiest way to implement thatp

Positive 5602 pOkay so I need to create codequeuecodecontains enqueue, dequeue, and isEmpty methods, codequeueNodecodestores names, setters and getters, and codequeueUsercodeMain classes. User enters one name at a time. Once 3 names have been entered, each new name entered will kick the front of the queue to the screen. This process will continue until the user enters quit as the name. Once this happens, all the remaining names will be displayed. I have everything but my usermain class. I cant seem to get it to work properly. It accepts 3 names, and after the third name is entered, displays the first name that was entered. Problem is, it stops there. I need it to keep going. I have a feeling I need a different loop, but I am just stuck right now. No help from my instructor, nothing in my textbook, and I have hit a brick wall.

Positive 5602 pI am trying to write an algorithm to find the intersection of a singly linked list. For this problem, the node of intersection does not actually have to be the same node object i.e. it doesnt have to be the same memory location, the lists just have to have the exact same values from the node of intersection to the end of the lists. I have written a horribly inefficient algorithm for this in cubic time. Im sure there is a better, probably recursive way to do this, but I cant quite figure it out. Any ideasp  pFor this problem, the intersection of two lists is a value for which all subsequent values in both lists are exactly identical.
