Positive 59504 pI want my web page to run some script immediately after it is loaded. I thought that I should use the DOMContentLoaded event to trigger this, which works great in Chrome, but in Internet Explorer 9 it takes a full 5 seconds longer. Here is a super simplified version to illustratep  precodelthtmlgtstufflthtmlgt ltscriptgt   console.logA  new Date   document.addEventListenerDOMContentLoaded, function   console.logB  new Date , false ltscriptgt codepre  pThe time shown in the console indicates 5 seconds between the end of the page being reached, and the DOMContentLoaded event firing.p  pI tried this running in localhost in Visual Studio, and also deployed to the server. All scripts and css files I reference are hosted in the same site, so they should be fairly immediate to load. Aside from some very small custom code, they includep  ul lijquery.jsli lijqueryui.js, with jqueryui.css, jqueryui.structure.css, jqueryui.theme.cssli lijqueryuitimepickeraddon.js, with jqueryuitimepickeraddon.cssli liprettify.js, with prettify.css this is Google Code Prettifyli lisorttable.jsli lidragtable.jsli livkBeautify.jsli ul  pUntil this is fixed I am just going to have to run my initialize method just at the end of the body, instead of using the event which just seems cleaner and better. Which leads to the secondary question running the code after the  seems to work with no problems, but I am concerned this could run code that requires objects to be loaded which are in the included .js files. Is that a valid concern, or do all browsers always run scripts in declarationorder, even when it is inline javascriptp
