Positive 110 pIs there a way, in Intellij or Eclipse or anything else, to monitor and alert when a particular class was changed after a version control update p  pI work in a 20people team, with 2 other teams modifying the code, with dozens of commits a day, and I would love to see when people make a change on something Im interested in and worked on.p  pEdit To give more context, we are responsible for functionalities we implement and communication cannot be in total freeflow some committers are in completely separate departments and floors, and dont know me or that what they change could have an impact on what I did, so I have no idea when someone tried to modify something I worked on. Sometimes, they, fix bugs I produced that I couldnt foresee, without realising there could be more to it and that I should either broaden their fix to other parts of the code or that there is a design flaw somewhere. p  pThe project is very big by my standard 9000 classes, 15 years old, 14000 unitintegration tests that run for 3 hours and Id love to find ways to fix little issues we have simply without forcing big changes yet in our processes. p
