Positive 33380 pI have a paid app in the Google Play Store. Im considering reducing the price of that app somewhat not all the way to free and offering one of the features as a separate inapp purchase.p  pIf I did that, I wouldnt want to yank the feature away from anybody whos already bought it.p  pIs there any way to figure out either the date that the user bought my app, or the original version of the app that they bought, or something like that Id like to say something like, If the app was before the price change either by date or by version, they should have the feature for free otherwise, require IAP to unlock the feature.p  pFor example, iOS does have a feature like this the app receipt includes an originalVersion field which can be used to control access to features.p
Positive 33380 pIm working on an unabridged dictionary app. My goal is to release a 4 rated app which schools can freely purchase. p  pThe nature of language is that some words are profane, disparaging, vulgar, or otherwise offensive. I have carefully identified words and definitions which are offensive, vulgar or could be considered inappropriate for children. My app can hidecensor them.p  pWhats the best way to release a 4 app, while also providing a way for adults to unlock the full dictionary, completed with profanity and all the offensive words p  pOne idea would be to require a free inapp purchase free nonconsumable InApp Purchase to unlock the offensive content, plus the option to set a password to relock offensive content. The idea being that a responsible partyadult would need to authorize it. p  pOther ideas or best practicesp

Positive 33380 pI have recently set up basic In App Purchases in my Android app that I am building. The problem I am having is that every time I install the app, via USB, I get the error This version of the application is not configured for billing through Google Play. Check the help centre for more information..p  pIt seems that the only way I can do a real test, using real SKUs is by uploading to the beta test group and installing from there. This can take up to 2 hours.p  pI am aware that I can use the SKU android.test.purchased instead of my own SKUs which I have created with the Android dev console.

Negative 33380 pI am aware that when we insert items to a vector its capacity could be increase by nonlinear factor. In gcc its capacity doubles. But I wonder why when I erase items from a vector, the capacity does not reduce. I tried to find out a reason for this. It seems C standard does not say any word about this reduction either to do or not. p  pFor my understand ideally, when vector size comes to 14 of its capacity at item deletion, it the vector could be shrunken by 12 of its capacity to achieve constant amortized space allocationdeallocation complexity.p  pMy question is why C standard does not specify capacity reduction policy What are the language design goals to not to specify anything about this Does anyone has an idea about this p
