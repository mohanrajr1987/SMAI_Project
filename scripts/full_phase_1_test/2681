Positive 2681 pI want to send UDP packages in a local network using GCDAsyncUdpSocket. My fear is that at some point UDP packages will be sent via LTE because of the newly introduced WiFi assist from iOS 9. Is there some way I can pretend iOS 9 from passing my traffic to cellular network, and instead require it to always use WiFip  pThanks a lot for any ideasp

Positive 2681 pI am very new to socket programming and Im currently working on a TCP program which accepts various commands from the user one being lsremote. The client sends the command to the server, and then depending on what the command is, the server acts accordingly. For lsremote, the server sends back to the client its current directories from the folder where it is running and the client prints them to the user. This is working perfectly. However, this is supposed to be done in a loop until the user enters exit. This is where my problem is, when the program prompts the user once again to enter another command after it has already done work with the server, then it does not work lsremote. I believe its because closenewsockfd is done at the end in my server code but I dont understand why I must do closenewsockfd or if I should even do that if I want to continue sending commands to the server. Also, if   closenewsockfd is required, how can I fix my problem so the user can enter commands until they wish to exit Here is my code please ignore the other commands as I have not implemented them yet.p

Positive 2681 pI want to be able to assign the same FQDN to two hosts within a network. I would have only 1 host, say h1 active at any time and want to dynamically assign FQDN of h1 to h2 when h1 goes down crashes. Is this possible at allp  pWith my limited knowledge of networking, I think I will have to use a VIP to point to h1. So, in DNS I will make an entry for h1 FQDN and the VIP, where VIP will point to h1. When h1 goes down, I will have to update the DNS to have the VIP point to h2 and reassign h1 FQDN to h2. Is this understanding correct Or do I have better faster options p  pI cannot use a load balancer. These hosts will never be exposed to outside world and other hosts accessing them will also be inside a private nw.p
Negative 2681 pI have dialog boxes as an acting IO but the thing is when I run the project the dialog box either doesnt show up or after the next dialog box the dialog box disappears so to speak. So my first thought is okay lets debug this and see if anything in the logic is wrong but I when I debug it everything works fine and the dialog box doesnt disappear. So I tried compressing it to a jar the same weird behavior happens and the dialog box disappears. However, the jar works fine on a different computer. Any ideas I dont know if this is a more of a me not understanding linux issue, a netbeans issues, or it quite obvious I missed something in the code of the project. Any ideas p  pAlso, it should be noted that I am defining disappears as the dialog box isnt showing but the project is still running and or is appearing in top. p
