Positive 2051 pUser can access our application in two ways, either as logged in or as guest user. Guest user has access to limited resource where as logged in user can access all resources. p  pWe have two applicationsapp1.com and app2.com using auth0, Im trying to implement SSO here. User logged in codeapp1.comcode and open new tab for codeapp2.comcode. Since both supports codeSSOcode, opening codeapp2.comcode I need to trigger authoziration request to codeauth0.comcode to check user had authenticatednot. p  pProblem here is when user hit codeapp2.comcode means codeapp2.comcoderoot will redirect to get codedesktop.htmlcode for both loggedunlogged user. For logged in user Im checking session to verifiy is user logged already and sent codedesktop.htmlcode, for unlogged user there is no session had created. so I come to know that user is not logged in through codeapp2.comcode yet but user might have logged in using codeapp1.comcode earlier. So I need to check with codeauth0.comcode to verify is user already logged in or not, Here Im using codeauthoriztioncode endpoint to check user authentication. since user isnt logged in yet Im prompt with login page, to ask user credentails. In this case I want to provide user the codeguest usercode access, but I cant. p  pInstead of promt login page I want codeauth0.comcode to fire codecallbackcode with error message, so that I can set session with error message and redirect to codecoderoot. In codecoderoot handler I will check if there is error message then give codeguest usercode access.p
