Positive 2888 pIm using Netty to implement a TCP server.p  pEverything seemed to be fine  the client where able to send the messages without any problem.. until I began to receive the exception Connection timed out..p  pThe weird thing was that the clients seemed to be unaware of the lost connection and continue to send the messages without any problem which leads to other problemsthe server will be unable to distinguish the clients after he has detected the connection lost.p  pI dont khow if the problem can be caused by a firewall Im using a cloud server or a proxy because everything leads me to think that only the sever was able to detect the connection lost.p  pAny help will be appreciated..p
Positive 2888 pIm trying to implement a simple OpenSSL clientserver model in C, and curious about the use of the BIO calls that allow for some nice features versus the raw SSL calls.p  pIm relatively new to this, so I could be looking at it completely wrong, but is it possible to use BIO calls on the client, and not use it on the server  Or for a connection to be established, a BIO handshake must occur on both client and serverp

Positive 2888 pI have a TCP server, which listens for incoming messagesdatarequests and replies accordingly. However, it does not reply after the first connection. If its a data message, the data is inserted into the database, but the confirmation message does not reach the client. And, there is no response if its a data request message. When I restart the server, it replies correctly only to the first incoming connection. Henceforth, there is no response from server to client.
