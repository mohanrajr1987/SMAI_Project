Positive 9780 pUsually, when I find myself in need to convert an enum to a string or viceversa, I generally take advantage of the a hrefhttpsmsdn.microsoft.comenuslibrarysystem.componentmodel.descriptionattributevvs.110.aspx relnofollowDescription Attributea.p  pFor instance, If I had the following enump  precodepublic enum QueryOperations       [Descriptioneq]      Equals,       [Descriptiongt]      GreaterThan,       [Descriptionlt]      LessThan  codepre  pI would convert codeQueryOperations.GreaterThancode to a string using its codeDescriptionAttributecodes value, i.e., it would be converted to codegtcode.p  pIn the same way, If i was to convert codeltcode to codeQueryOperationscode, I would end up with codeQueryOperations.LessThancode.p  pI really like this approach and never failed me so far. I think it is flexible, easy to understand and it is decoupled from the enums value names.p  pHowever, quoting MSDN, a codeDescriptionAttributecodep  blockquote   p[...] Specifies a description for a property or event.p blockquote  pAn example is shownp  precode[DescriptionThe image associated with the control,CategoryAppearance]  public Image MyImage  get set  codepre  pThis troubles me because it seems that the purpose of the codeDescriptionAttributecode is semantically different to what I use it for.p  pUsing Attributes to convert an enum is not a silly nor crazy idea, so my question isp  pstrongIs it there an attribute specifically designed for this casestrongp  pSomething likep  precodepublic enum QueryOperations      [StringRepresentationeq]     Equals,     ...  codepre
