On each click it checks the template url, deletes the number and replaces it this bit we know works fine. The problem comes with the images. If I create a new image in the tapButton ActionEvent it doesnt load, I have to create the image as its own JLabel outside of the buttonp  phere is the code for the JLabel there are five of these ill show you only onep  precodeJLabel locationOne  new JLabelImage 1 locationOne.setBackgroundColor.WHITE  locationOne.setIconnew ImageIconurlLocationOne   urlLocationOne not available outside of button locationOne.setBounds84, 38, 66, 100 contentPane.addlocationOne codepre  pso if the imageIcon is created inside the button it doesnt work, if its created outside the button, it is outside of urlLocationOnes scope and if I create a field I create an immutable string that only changes inside the tap button and when called outside the tapButton method it displays the original string. What is the best way to place the images so that the images respond the path changes on each click. remember the paths are changing I just cant get the ImageIcon JLabel to hear the change.p

Negative 494 pIm working with a WinForms app. I have an RDLC report that will be printed on 11x17 and then folded printer supports folding. Im rendering to EMF and drawing to pages of a PrintDocument. This works fine except for folding.p  pWhat Id like to do is store the settings that make the printer fold. The users would select a preset from a dropdown and the app would select the printer, the paper size, the tray, whether to duplex, and whether to fold. Storing the PrinterSettings object covers most of this, but doesnt save the folding option.p  pI first attempted to storeretrieve something I read about called DEVMODE. For reference a hrefhttpnicholas.piasecki.nameblog200811programmaticallyselectingcomplexprinteroptionsincshar relnofollowhttpnicholas.piasecki.nameblog200811programmaticallyselectingcomplexprinteroptionsincshara. What I found is that even though I had extra data specific to the driver, all the bytes were 0 regardless of what driverspecific settings I changed. Im not sure where I went wrong with this, but I abandoned it and looked at the printing capabilities in WPF.p  pI found that I could configure a PrintTicket for my settings, store it, and retrieve it later. It seems a bit convoluted just to save the settings, but I think I have it working. At least it seems to show up correctly in the PrintDialog. However, Im now stuck trying to figure out how to print my report.p  pAs I understand it, I cant take a PrintDocument from WinForms printing and use it in WPF. I also read EMF format is not supported in WPF. I thought I would render each EMF to a bitmap, then print those. But the text in my report is fuzzy and Im not having any luck clearing it up. p  pStarting with a stream that contains EMF bytes that I know will render sharply with PrintDocument, I test trying to save to a file. It seems no settings that I provide will save with crisp text.p  precodevar pageImage  new Metafilestream pageImage.Savefilename codepre  pAll this just to add the ability to fold. Am I just completely on the wrong track I dont see how this should be so hard. I guess I either need to find another way to saverestore custom printer settings or I need a way to render these EMF files better.p  pI also tried rendering the report directly to BMP format and its also poor quality.p
