Positive 371 pId like to segment Lisp source code into a list of code segments. Each segment is either a top level Sexpression, or whatever text between those Sexpressions. p  pInitially I thought that I could use regular expression pattern to match top level Sexpression, but I found that its not as trivial to handle the matching parenthesis to at the top level only. p  pI feel that it might be possible to work out a regular expression to match top level Sexp by following example of this a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions3227728usingregularexpressionstoextractfunctionsandfunctionheadersfromsourceUsing regular expressions to extract functions and function headers from source codeap  pNext, I figure that I may scan the text to observe the first left parenthesis , and the last right parenthesis , and do the segmentation accordingly. p  pBefore I do that I feel that given the ubiquitous nature of Sexpression in emacs Lisp, there should have already existing solution to my requirements. p  pSo I ask if you could teach me any solutionp  pThanks, p

Positive 371 pIm building an app in Meteor, and am a big fan the autorebuild action, that listens to any file change, rebuilds the app and refreshes my browser. However, I recently started to use flycheck with eslint and flycheck creates a temporary files called codeflycheckmymodule.jscode in the current directory whenever I make a change in a file as opposed to only on save. Meteor sees these files being created and rebuilds and reloads. This causes a lot of action and is heavy for my browser and ruining my workflow.p  pI can customize the prefix for for these files f.x. to code.flycheckcode and that will make Meteor ignore them, however that will break the eslint checker.p  pSo my question is. Is there any way to tell meteor to prevent all files starting with codeflycheckcode from triggering a rebuild, something like codemeteor run ignore flycheck.jscode.p

Positive 371 pIn the ESS Emacs speaks Statistics manual, it says if I use Cygwin bash shell, I should run codeMx S RETcode. p  pand if MSDOS prompt shell, run something like codeMx S6msdos RETcode.p  pso whats the proper syntax for starting a Stata process I tried codeMx statamsdos RETcode, codeMx stamsdoscode, and codeMx Statamsdoscode and failed.p  pEDIT 1 Im using Windows 8.1 and MSDOS prompt shell this is the shell pops up when I use codeMx shellcodep  pIt seems there is some problem when I use codeMx stata RETcode might not be the right command for msdos shell, instead of opening a new buffer in Stata mode, Emacs starts Stata in its own window and leaves the old Emacs window irresponsive, which I have to force kill in the end.p  pEDIT 2 I asked roughly the same question in the ess mailing list and someone mentioned that it seems in Windows Stata Can only be used with its own GUI, not the command line, and that explains why when I codeMx stata RETcode it always opens its own window  I thought it was because I was using the wrong command. I asked the question because I didnt see the question being asked, now I guess I understand sadly why because it can not be solved..p

Negative 371 pIm trying to write a small C utility library that among other things makes the clockgettime API available on virtually any platform.  Basically, I want to check whether clockgettime exists, use the native implementation if its available, and implement it based on other timer APIs if its not available.  Easy, right  I expected this to be pretty trivial, so naturally, its turned out to be nearly impossible to do it the way I want. p  pHeres my problem If I want users to be able to call the clockgettime API transparently, I need my header file to emexactlyem detect whether a native declarationdefinition is presentp  ul liOptimistic detection doesnt work for obvious reasons If clockgettime is not present but my headers preprocessor macros think it is, it wont be defined, and users will get compiler errors.li liConservative detection is even worse If clockgettime is present and included but my header doesnt detect it, my own implementation will conflict with it...and Ive learned the hard way that compilers wont even complain about clockgettime being redefined.  Instead, if you override an existing clockgettime, your function will be called, sort of, but it will have completely BIZARRE undefined behavior and crash or get into an infinite loop even if your fallback implementation doesnt have any loops.li ul  pSo, is there any way reliable way to detect clockgettime  I know that unistd.h is supposed to define the POSIXTIMERS macro if clockgettime is present...but is this guaranteed for every implementation  From my understanding its not, but I could be wrong.p  ul liIf so, how can I reliably detect whether unistd.h is present its not present on Windows, at least in MSVC, and its present on LinuxBSDs, but there are a lot of minor OSs out there, etc.li liIf not, is there anything else a simple header file can do to reliably detect itli ul  pIf there is no automatic solution, is there any reliable, precise list of all platforms that support or do not support clockgettime, along with their identification macros for those not at a hrefhttpsourceforge.netppredefwikiOperatingSystems relnofollowhttpsourceforge.netppredefwikiOperatingSystemsa  This isnt ideal, since the list could get out of sync as new platforms arise, but its better than nothing.p  pI COULD just create a totally new timer API for my own little library, of course.  Then I could conservatively detect clockgettime and fall back on other backends as necessary.  This is an obvious solution that would easily work, but...who wants to learn another stupid timer API  Does the world really need one, just to get around the stupidity of a language that has no builtin mechanisms to detect whether a given function already exists p  pJustification Why dont I just use C11s stdchronop  ol liThe C11 chrono interface does not support process timers, which are preferable for certain kinds of benchmarking.  These timers will not be available on every platform, but Id like to use them on a besteffort basis, and clockgettime is the bestknown existing interface that supports them.li liId like for this code to run on C03, so I need a consistent user interface regardless of the underlying language standard or OS...and theres no way Im going to reimplement the entire C11 stdchrono interface on platforms that dont have it.  That would be insane.li ol

Negative 371 pI am creating the middleware to be called after app.router and I need to access the data that was stored in res.locals object by the route middleware and route handler.p  precode... app.useapp.router app.usemyMiddleware ...  app.get, functionreq, res      res.locals.data  some data   function myMiddlewarereq, res, next      if res.locals.data         console.logthere is data     else         console.logdata is removed  thats what happens  codepre  pThe problem is that all properties of res.locals become empty after app.router.p  pI tried to find the place where express or connect cleans res.locals to somehow patch it but so far I cant find it.p  pThe only solution I see at the moment is to abandon the idea of putting this logic in a separate middleware and put it in routespecific middleware, where res.locals is available, but it will make the system much more interconnected. Also I have many routes where route middleware does not call next when res.redirect is called, so I will have to do many changes to make it work. Id very much like to avoid it and put this logic in a separate middleware, but I need to access the data that was stored in res.locals.p  pAny help really appreciated.p
