Negative 78757 pSo I have this problem that I need to work out for work, but I cant figure out a good algorithm. I am given the average for the reviews and the number of total reviews. From those two pieces of information, I need to randomly generate how many 5 star, 4 star, 3 star, 2 star, and 1 star reviews were made. Here are two formulas that might better explain what exactly the problem is.p  precodeGiven Review Average x Given Total Number of Reviews y  Find a   of 5 star reviews b   of 4 star reviews c   of 3 star reviews d   of 2 star reviews e   of 1 star reviews  a  b  c  d  e  total  of reviews KNOWN y 5a  4b  3c  2d  1e  total number of stars  averagex  total reviewsy codepre  pThis is more of a type of math problem than programming, but I need to be able to write some type of algorithm to get a,b,c,d, and e programatically in JavaScript. Does anyone know of any good algorithms for something like this Thanksp
Negative 78757 pI am wondering what is the canonical approach to solve the following problem in Rx Say I have two observables, codemousedowncode and codemouseupcode, whose elements represent mouse button presses. In a very simplistic scenario, if I wanted to detect a long press, I could do it the following way in this case using RxPy, but conceptually the same in any Rx implementationp  precodemouselongpress  mousedown.delay1000.takeuntilmouseup.repeat codepre  pHowever, problems arise when we need to hoist some information from the codemousedowncode observable to the codemouseupcode observable. For example, consider if the elements of the observable stored information about which mouse button was pressed. Obviously, we would only want to pair codemousedowncode with codemouseupcode of the corresponding button. One solution that I came up with is thisp  precodemouselongpress  mousedown.selectmanylambda x     rx.Observable.justx.delay1000         .takeuntilmouseup.wherelambda y x.button  y.button  codepre  pIf there is a more straight forward solution, I would love to hear it  but as far as I can tell this works. However, things get more complicated, if we also want to detect how far the mouse has moved between codemousedowncode and codemouseupcode. For this we need to introduce a new observable codemousemovecode, which carries information about the mouse position.p  precodemouselongpress  mousedown.selectmanylambda x     mousemove.selectlambda z distancex, z gt 100.delay1000         .takeuntilmouseup.wherelambda y x.button  y.button  codepre  pHowever, this is pretty much where I get stuck. Whenever a button is held down longer than 1 second, I get a bunch of boolean values. However, I only want to detect a long press when all of them are false, which sounds like the perfect case for the a hrefhttpreactivex.iodocumentationoperatorsall.html relnofollowall operatora. It feels like theres only a small step missing, but I havent been able to figure out how to make it work so far. Perhaps I am also doing things in a backwards way. Looking forward to any suggestions.p

Negative 78757 pIm trying to write an integration for enterprise system. p  pThere is a web server who is being used by many clients from two different place.

However I cant set the default printer on runtime. p  pstrongSince its a web server that works in background I cant populate a printer dialog and let the user choose the printer.

Negative 78757 pIm trying to come up with ways of battling a spam bot that just submits my form with blank entries. p  pMy form uses JQuery to check if the fields have been filled out, and to check if the email field has been filled out correctly. However this spam bot is managing to get around this by disabling JavaScript and is able to submit a completely blank form. So what I need is a way to stop this but the issue here is that I cant use any kind of captcha plugins that im finding online etc because I cant use PHP, so I would need client side verification on whatever it is I could use to combat it but then my other question is if this spam bot is able to disable JavaScript then surely any kind of measures I put in, for example a honeypot captcha or disabling the form for 5 seconds when the page loads, wouldnt work because of the JavaScript just being turned off and once again this spam bot just bypassing everything and completing a blank submission.p
