Positive 90304 pOur web app performs a random number of tasks for a user initiated action. We have built a small system where a master server calculates the number of worker servers that are needed to complete the task, and the same number of EC2 instances are Turned On which pick up the tasks and perform the same.p  pTurned On because the time taken to span an instance from an AMI is extremely high. So the idea is have a pool of worker instances and start and stop them as per requirement.p  pAlso considering how amazon charges when you start up an instance You are billed for 1 hour every time you Turn on an instance. The workers once spawned will be active for an hour and will accept other tasks during this period.p  pWe have managed to get this architecture up and running, however the boot up time still bothers us as it fluctuates between 40 to 80 seconds. Is there some way we can reduce the same.p  pBelow is the stack information of the things running on the worker instancep  ul liUbuntu AMIli liNode JS using foreverservice for auto startup on bootli liDocker the tasks are performed inside individual docker containersli ul

The idea is to provision a cluster in our datacenter as a Mesos cluster and use e.g. Kubernetes to orchestrate the Docker containers.p  pFor Docker and Kubernetes there are atomic host OSes like a hrefhttpwww.projectatomic.io relnofollowProject Atomica and a hrefhttpscoreos.com relnofollowCoreOSa that are immutable and atomically updated but is there anything similar for Mesos, i.e. an immutable, atomic and lightweight platform for running the Mesos slaves and masters on bare metal or in a VMp  pI figure such a platform would be the best way to distribute Mesos across a cluster especially if its a big cluster and then the rest of the functionality provided by Kubernetes and Docker would run on top of Mesos. Thus there is no need to distribute e.g. Docker to each node my impression is that its taken care of by the MesosDocker integration.p  pAny alternatives to distribute Mesos across a big clusterdatacenter that doesnt require manual or PuppetChefAnsible provisioning would also be of interest.p  pRegards, Olap

Negative 90304 pOne of my apps is having a problem after running on a device which has just upgraded to iOS9 apps target is 8.1. p  pThe app is working fine on pre iOS9, however, after ONLY upgrading to iOS9 on device the following problem is happening.p  pThe variable below called anObsDate is now returning null. I have no idea why. It seems the standalone upgrade of iOS9 on the host device has triggered this problem to happen. p  precodeNSDate anObsDate  [[self bomDateFormatter] dateFromString[anObs timeStamp]] codepre  pWhen I run the app with the following debug, we have this outputp  precode     NSLogTimestamp , [anObs timeStamp]      NSLogFormatter , [self bomDateFormatter]      NSDate anObsDate  [[self bomDateFormatter] dateFromString[anObs timeStamp]]  Timestamp 20150917 000110 Formatter ltNSDateFormatter 0x7fe7abc653c0gt codepre  pI set my date formatter up as followsp  precodeNSLocale locale  [[NSLocale alloc] initWithLocaleIdentifierenAU] NSDateFormatter countDownFormatter  [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init] [countDownFormatter setLocalelocale] [countDownFormatter setTimeZone[NSTimeZone timeZoneWithNameAustraliaMelbourne]] [countDownFormatter setDateFormatyyyyMMddTHHmmss] return countDownFormatter codepre  pAgain to make this clear, if I run my app on a pre iOS9 device, everything works fine, and dateFromString returns a NSDate. After upgrading to iOS9 dateFromString returns null.p  pAny suggestionsp  pThanks.p
