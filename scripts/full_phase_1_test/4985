If I store this info to DB, clearing the data will cause me to lose the information, so I want to know if there is a way to store the info with image only.p

Negative 4985 pim developing a game for android based on the SurfaceView class. Currently im stuck trying to optimize the view for different screensizes.p  pProblem 1 i have PNGFiles in my res folder and i draw them using Canvas.drawBitmap. After reading this article  a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidepracticesscreenssupport.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comguidepracticesscreenssupport.htmla  i thought android resizes the bitmaps if the screen is bigger. Unfortunately i recognized no scaling or any changes when launching my app on a tablet vs. launching it on a phone. So how is it done Should i come up with some fancy strategy to calculate the available space and draw my bitmaps using the source and destinationRectangle Would be nice if someone has a best practice or some hints how to draw bitmaps on a canvas. I already read the pixelltdip conversion topics but i have to say i dont know how to use that solution in my app. So any help appreciated...p  pProblem 2 I have 3 PNGs in my res folder. One ldpi, one mdpi and one hdpi. Ldpi image has 50px50px, mdpi has 75px75px and hdpi has 100px100px. When i load the app in the emulator 800480 it uses the 100100 png. When i load the app on the Acer Iconia Tab it uses the 7575 image. I thought hdpi is for big screens tab and mdpi or ldpi would be used for the emulator screen. At least i thought android would use the hdpiimage also on the tab but i got surprised... Any explantation for this as well much appreciatedp  pSorry 4 long text, just trying to be clear...p  pcya EffDeep
