Sometimes the execution plan in SQL Server 2005 says one is faster than the other, depending on the indexing.  Sometimes it does all hash matching, which appears to be CPU intensive versus a sort then a merge join which appears to be more IO intensive.  The real world results do not always mirror what one would expect given the results of the execution plan.p  hr  pCan someone clarify for me some simple scenarios where one is better than the other  Or at least verify if my understanding is correct  It appears to me that if you are joining on columns that are indexed well, it is more efficient to not constrain the join with a year or some other piece of data, because it can use hash matching based on the index and has no need to sort and use a temp table.  p  pHowever, if you are selecting and joining on nonindexed columns in both queries, adding the time constraint results in less rows to be processed and leads to a faster sort and merge join, even though it incurs some more IO cost.p  hr  pAlso, it bothers me that the prejoin select from table2 does not take into account the limited subset of values that result from the where clause on table1, it appears to select all rows from table2 when not using a constraint on the join. Since the rows from table1 will be limited b WHERE t1.year  2010 and the join is limited by t1.year  t2.year, shouldnt it follow that a join would only have to look at table2 where year  2010p  pI wonder why it does not look at the where clause first, and select only matching rows before it even does the join, Im sure there is some good reasoning behind this, but it escapes me, according to the execution plan, the number of rows looked at from table2 in that case does change depending on whether you have added t2.year  2010 to the join or not.p  pThank you in advance, and sorry for the long question. Im trying to be as clear as possible. Please excuse my inexperience.p
