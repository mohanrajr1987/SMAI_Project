Positive 46220 pI am using a Chrome extension to modify an codeinputcode element by adding a function that triggers an alert if the text exceeds 30 charactersp  precodeinputElement.onkeyup  function   ... some code here ...  codepre  pBefore a UI update to the app this worked as expected. Now its broken. The new UI has changed superficially, reflecting, I presume, new CSS. I can alter codeinputElementcodes default value so I know Im still hitting the element correctly. Could new CSS or possibly the apps own jQuery be preventing my function from working If so, is there a solutionp  pstrongUpdatestrong Just to clarify. My question isnt, Why isnt the code below not working Its, Can injecting an codeonkeyupcode into an input form that does not currently have this attribute be broken by some other feature of a web app, such as CSS or jQuery I have as, Maximillian Laumeister suggests, tried the codeaddEventListenercode method, and this works. Though, is this foolproof Is there a foolproof solution at all Or is it more of test with each update to the app and reevaluatep
Positive 46220 pIt seems the Chrome does not inject content script into local files that are of type MHTML. They might do this for security reason.

Negative 46220 pIve got a small little ruby script that pours over 80,000 or so records.br The processor and memory load involved for each record is smaller than a smurf balls, but it still takes about 8 minutes to walk all the records. p  pId though to use threading, but when I gave it a go, my db ran out of connections. Sure it was when I attempted to connect 200 times, and really I could limit it better than that.. But when Im pushing this code up to Heroku where I have 20 connections for all workers to share, I dont want to chance blocking other processes because this one ramped up. p  pI have thought of refactoring the code so that it conjoins the all the SQL, but that is going to feel really really messy. p  pSo Im wondering is there a trick to letting the threads share connections  Given I dont expect the connection variable to change during processing, I am actually sort of surprised that the thread fork needs to create a new DB connection. p  pWell any help would be super cool just like me.. thanksp  pHR  SUPER strongCONTRIVEDstrong EXAMPLEbr Below is a 100 contrived example.

To do this I am using a Handler, but I dont know how to retrive the data that I send to my Handler. p  pTo send data i usep  precodehandler.obtainMessageintCode.sendToTarget codepre  pWhere intCode is an int.
