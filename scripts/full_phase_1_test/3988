Negative 3988 pI have a function that is meant to get values from a SQL database table called ProductProfiles and display them inside a .csv document that users can download and view. The results are based on a drop down lists selection called ddlClassification. The function works almost perfectly, but the while loop used to write the sql data to a .csv file keeps repeating data. For example, if 3 entries exist we will call them A, B and C, the .csv file should only show 3 entries. However, with things as they are now, these 3 entries are repeated multiple times in the .csv file, which is incorrect.p  pI am not sure what Im missing from the function to end this repeating issue.p  pThis is the functionp  precodeprivate void WriteProductProfilestring ProfileID, ref TextWriter tw      string CatList  GetCatList      string sqlQuery  SELECT [ProfileID], [Name], [Description], [SpeciesLink],           [LineDraw], [LineDrawThumbnail], [ProfileThumbnail], [ComponentThickness],           [ComponentWidth], [ComponentFactor], [FinishedThickness], [FinishedWidth],           ISNULL[ClassificationID],1 as ClassificationID, [StockOrCust],           [Visibility], [Notes], [OrderBy]         FROM ProductProfile         WHERE ClassificationID  ClassificationID     using SqlConnection cn  new SqlConnectionConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[AbleCommerce].ToString              SqlCommand cmd  new SqlCommandsqlQuery, cn         cmd.Parameters.Addnew SqlParameterClassificationID, ddlClassification.SelectedValue         cmd.CommandType  CommandType.Text         cn.Open         using IDataReader reader  cmd.ExecuteReader                      whilereader.Read                              string myLine  reader[ProfileID]  t                      ImportHelper.CleanHTMLTextreader[Name].ToString  t                      ImportHelper.CleanHTMLTextreader[Description].ToString  t                      reader[SpeciesLink]  t                      reader[LineDraw]  t                      reader[LineDrawThumbnail]  t                      reader[ProfileThumbnail]  t                      reader[ComponentThickness]  t                      reader[ComponentWidth]  t                      reader[ComponentFactor]  t                      reader[FinishedThickness]  t                      reader[FinishedWidth]  t                      reader[ClassificationID]  t                      reader[StockOrCust]  t                      reader[Visibility]  t                      ImportHelper.CleanHTMLTextreader[Notes].ToString  t                      reader[OrderBy]  t                 tw.WriteLinemyLine                               cn.Close       codepre  pThis is the code calling the WriteProductProfile functionp  precodeprivate void ProcessCategoryCategory MainCat, ref TextWriter tw, ref string ProdUseList      string sqlQuery  SELECT [ProfileID], [ClassificationID] FROM bairdProductProfile WHERE ClassificationID  ClassificationID     string profId       using SqlConnection cn  new SqlConnectionConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[AbleCommerce].ToString              SqlCommand cmd  new SqlCommandsqlQuery, cn         cmd.Parameters.Addnew SqlParameterClassificationID, ddlClassification.SelectedValue         cmd.CommandType  CommandType.Text         cn.Open         using IDataReader reader  cmd.ExecuteReader                      while reader.Read                              profId  reader[ProfileID].ToString                               cn.Close           foreach CatalogNode subCat in MainCat.CatalogNodes              process the children items         switch subCat.CatalogNodeType                      case CatalogNodeType.Category                 ProcessCategoryCategorysubCat.ChildObject, ref tw, ref ProdUseList                 break             case CatalogNodeType.Product                 if AddProductprofId, ref ProdUseList                     WriteProductProfileprofId, ref tw                 break                codepre
