Positive 1124 pThanks for taking your time to read this question.p  pWhat do I needp  pWe have a SOAP web service hosted somewhere that will take a couple of parameters and generate reports by using SQL Server Reporting Services. The format of the report file could be a couple including excel and pdf. We dont own that service and we cannot change it.p  pWe need a web app that calls the SOAP web service I mentioned above, generate a report, and stream the file back to the browser. p  pIt has to be a web api 2 angularjs app.p  pWhat do I havep  pSo far I got client calling web api no problem, and i can see the result all the way back from the SOAP web service, but I cannot download the file, or even I got the file downloaded, its either saying the file is corrupted or the file is blank.p  pMy Codep  pserver sidep  precode        var reportResponse  new RequestResponse             try

Negative 1124 pRight from the start I found Xcode to be way to overloaded for simple C programs I have to write for university. Lately I discovered Textwrangler to be more of an editor I wanted to use for that purpose, beforehand I used VIM quite a lot, but having a mouse to navigate seems charming to me as well. So I tried setting Textwrangler the default editor for C code Im running Mavericks at the moment, but it wont keep the settings I make. The way I tried to set the editor as default is rightclicking on a Cfile, clicking Open with another app, choose Textwrangler and click Always open with this app as already mentioned it does not keep the setting. I suspect Xcode to overwrite the setting, is there a way I can get around thatp
Negative 1124 pIm having a bit of difficulty with monad transformers at the moment.  Im defining a few different nondeterministic relations which make use of transformers.  Unfortunately, Im having trouble understanding how to translate cleanly from one effectful model to another.p  pSuppose these relations are foo and bar.  Suppose that foo relates As and Bs to Cs suppose bar relates Bs and Cs to Ds.  We will define bar in terms of foo.  To make matters more interesting, the computation of these relations will fail in different ways.  Since the bar relation depends on the foo relation, its failure cases are a superset.  I therefore give the following type definitionsp  precodedata FooFailure  FooFailure String data BarFailure  BarSpecificFailure  BarFooFailure FooFailure type FooM  ListT EitherT FooFailure Reader Context type BarM  ListT EitherT BarFailure Reader Context codepre  pI would then expect to be able to write the relations with the following function signaturesp  precodefoo  A gt B gt FooM C bar  B gt C gt BarM D codepre  pMy problem is that, when writing the definition for bar, I need to be able to receive errors from the foo relation and properly represent them in bar space.  So Id be fine with a function of the formp  precodeconvert  e gt e gt ListT EitherT e Reader Context a                      gt ListT EitherT e Reader Context a codepre  pI can even write that little beast by running the ListT, mapping on EitherT, and then reassembling the ListT because it happens that m [a] can be converted to ListT m a.  But this seems... messy.p  pTheres a good reason I cant just run a transformer, do some stuff under it, and generically put it back the transformer I ran might have effects and I cant magically undo them.  But is there some way in which I can lift a function just far enough into a transformer stack to do some work for me so I dont have to write the codeconvertcode function shown abovep
Negative 1124 pI see a lot of requests about this,  looked a bit and didnt see my particular issue but I very well could have missed it.  Apologies if so.p  pIm making a website that calls out to a service stack service.  The service is published and hosted on a server.p  pI encountered this error earlier when trying to make a GET call to the service and found that adding this p  precode            base.SetConfignew EndpointHostConfig                      GlobalResponseHeaders            AccessControlAllowOrigin,  ,          AccessControlAllowMethods, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS ,          AccessControlAllowHeaders, ContentType ,         ,          codepre  pResolved the issue.  Now however when making an ajax call via the sitep  precode.ajax                     type POST,                     url httpspirates.comSHIPSWSshipDemo,                     data                          Bow BowTypes.val,                         BodyContent CKEDITOR.instances.body.getData                     ,                     success function data                          EmailBody  data                                       codepre  pI get the same error p  precodeXMLHttpRequest cannot load httpspirates.comSHIPSWSshipDemo. No AccessControlAllowOrigin header is present on the requested resource. Origin httplocalhost58032 is therefore not allowed access.  codepre  pWhich confuses me since I set the above and the GET statements that are called prior in the website through ajax work like a charm.p  pWhat further confuses me is that if I use say, the postman add on for chrome to make an actual post request to the service.  It works without issue.p  pWould anyone have any ideas what Im doing wrongp  pEdit 1 p  pHeaders via chrome when calling from the local website.p  precodeRequest URLhttpspirates.comSHIPSWSshipDemo Request Headers CAUTION Provisional headers are shown.

Negative 1124 pSo i am attempting to teach myself C, I have a program that I originally wrote in batch and am attempting to recreate in C using WPF. I have a button that allows a user to set a directory, that directory selected is then displayed in a text box above a listbox which adds every subfolder, only first level, to the listbox. Now all this works fine but it writes out the entire directory path in the listbox. I have been trying to figure out how to strip the leading directory path off the list box entries for over an hour to no avail. Here is what I have so farp  precode    private void btnSetDirectoryClickobject sender, RoutedEventArgs e              Create a folder browser dialog and set the selected path to steamPath         var steamPath  new FolderBrowserDialog         DialogResult result  steamPath.ShowDialog          Update the text box to reflect the selected folder path         txtSteamDirectory.Text  steamPath.SelectedPath          Clear and update the list box after choosing a folder         lbFromFolder.Items.Clear          string folderName  steamPath.SelectedPath         foreach string f in Directory.GetDirectoriesfolderName                              lbFromFolder.Items.Addf                   codepre  pNow I tried changing the last line to this, and it did not work it just crashed the programp  precode    foreach string f in Directory.GetDirectoriesfolderName              lbFromFolder.Items.Addf.Substringf.LastIndexOf      codepre  pI am fairly certain that the LastIndexOf route is probably the right one but I am at a dead end. I apologize if this is a dumb question but this is my first attempt at using C. Thanks in advance.p
