Positive 848 pWhen in GGTS, if I open the grails command window and enter something like prod war to build the war file, when it gets done building the war file, GGTS proceeds to open roughly 100 files. This totally locks up the system and the usual recourse is to kill the process. Has anyone else seen this and, if so, do you know how to make it stop happeningp
Positive 848 pI have a groovy grails application that uses the grails strongspring security 2.0.RC5strong plugin. Lets say I have 2 tabs open. On the 1st one I logout of the application. Then, on the 2nd one I click a button that makes an ajax call to the application. p  pBecause I am logged out, the entry point will be codeLoginController.authAjaxcode. The default code generated by the plugin in this method isp  pcoderesponse.setHeader Location, SpringSecurityUtils.securityConfig.auth.ajaxLoginFormUrlcode coderesponse.sendError HttpServletResponse.SCUNAUTHORIZEDcodep  pI get the 401 on my ajax call and its ok. The problem comes that now, if I go back on the login page and resubmit the login form I get redirected to the method codeLoginController.authAjaxcode. p  pThe code in this method isp  pcoderender[success true, username springSecurityService.authentication.name] as JSONcodep  pThis in turn does not redirect me to the dashboard page in the application but renders codesuccesstrue,usernameuser1codep  pObviously this is not the intended behaviour. How do I fix this  thank youp
