Positive 9581 pLets say I have information on sheet 1 within a1j40.p  pCertain details would be changed accordingly to client request. And I would have to print 3 identical copies of this sheet 1 for each event. Lets also assume that this document follows a serial number at j2 every time. For simplicity, number it as D1001p  pnow the idea I have in mind is that for every time I hit print, the code will  1. copy the current printout of a1j40,  2. paste it on a new workbook 3. change the serial number in j2 from d1001 to t1001,  4. and then proceed on to save this new workbook name as t1001,same as cell j2.p  pDo Note that it should only be triggered after every PRINT.this is my main challenge.p

Negative 9581 pDoes anyone know how to calculate the complexity of a nested binary search tree I have implemented a nested binary search tree to a depth of 3 BSTs. p  pEDIT I apologize for the confusion, I had meant that each node of the BST would point to the root node of another BST. The complexity I was asking for was time complexity of search, update, and delete basic operations. I had assume that since the time complexity of a BST was Ologn, the time complexity of a nested BST in terms of search, update, and delete wouldnt differ that much.p
Negative 9581 pI am studying for an exam and Im a bit confused as to how to answer this question.The way I interpret it is that they want to know the methods of stack which are,codeoffercode codepeekcode codepollcode codesizecode codeisEmptycode and their functons which I understand.But the part Im stuck at is describing there relationship with the stack.I know the stack methods codeemptycode,codepeekcode and codepopcode are similar but is this the correct way to answer this questionThanksp
Negative 9581 pI have a UIwebview which loads up a page ,first the links in the page were opening up on the same page, that made it look ugly, then I found a function which made the link open up in the phones safari browser.That was nice but actually I want to show the links in a pop up view which can simply be closed. I have seen the google map popping up and showing the map. I want to do the same same thing with the links on the page they should open up as pop up and should not open up in safari and neither in the same UIWebview. What could be the possible way to implement this.p  pAnother inspiration is phonegaps ChildBrowser which opens the link as a popup. I want to implement the same in native. Any help and suggestions will be appreciated.p
Negative 9581 pIm new to PHP, and whenever Im reading up on good practices, especially relating to OOP, I often see statements such as dont expose local variables to the global space, use a getter method or retrieval method instead. p  pI understand why we dont want to pollute the global namespace, but at what point does it become simply ridiculous to call a getter method just to access a simple property I think this shows massive hypocrisy. Were willing to expose and call methods outside of the class definition, but not simple variables Why is this Isnt a method much more complexp  pForgive me if my confusion is missplaced. Im genuinely interested in understanding OOP best practices.  p
