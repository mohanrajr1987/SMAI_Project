Positive 5482 pI am dealing with unrelated processes synchronization. For unrelated processes, Named semaphores are necessary. We cant handle unrelated process with Unnamed Semaphore as mentioned here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions13145885nameandunnamedsemaphoreStackOverFlowa. Now, if we want to use Named semaphore counting semaphore as a binary semaphore, then what is the procedure. I know that we can make Unnamed Semaphore to binary semaphore as mentioned here a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions7478684howtoinitialiseabinarysemaphoreincStackOverFlowa .  And if we want to synchronize threads by binary semaphores, then pthreadmutex are available. May you please suggest how to use strongnamed semaphorestrong as strongbinary semaphorestrong or Is there any other methods to synchronize unrelated process  as binary semaphores.  Thanks in advance.p

Positive 5482 pIn the code below, although I avoid deadlock due to reverse locking hierarchy. However, due to T2 going into an infinite loop, the mutex m1 and m2 never get released, in this case the system can neither achieve progress nor bounded wait in terms of time.

Theres a circular region of radius 7 feet and the cameras are placed on opposite end of each other which means if camera1 is placed at 0 degree of the circular region then camera2 is placed at 180 degree of that same region so they are on a straight line exactly opposite of each other on the circumference of the circular region.p  pI need to calibrate the cameras and need to find intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.Im using opencv for  this. p  pCan I use cvStereoCalibrate for this camera setupp  pIm asking this because if you look at the camera setup you will see that theres a point on camera1 and camera2s captured image that is collinear with epipoles of both cameras. So the epipolar line is a point. Will this be an issue for calibration procedure If yes is it possible to tell me how to solve this problemp
