Positive 34595 pThis question is similar to the following a hrefhttpsuperuser.comquestions406560whydoescopyinganxmlfilefromwindowsserver2008r264bittowindowsxp32Hereap  pThe computer specs are slightly different the server is a 2012 windows 8 server, and the computer copying the data is a 32bit Windows 7.p  pAfter the XML file is copied from the 2012 server, data from the middle of the file is appended to the bottom. This also occurs when viewing the file from a connected drive on the windows 7 computer.p  pFrom my desktop, a Windows 7 64bit, the file looks fine.p  pDoes anyone have any suggestions other than what are already listed on the question from the hyperlink above The file is created and copied via a Visual Basic program, and so I wanted to check what other possibilities there were before following the zip folder solution.p

Positive 34595 pIf this is not the right section for this question, please forgive me.p  pI need to access remotely a desktop. This desktop running Windows 7 stays on 247, and usually an user called Operator is logged on. When I attempt the remote access, this is done by accessing the companys server by a VPN, and then access the desired machine using the remote access tool from Windows. The latter process tries to log off from the current user and log in on my user account, lets call MyUser.p  pProblem is, one of the running applications is preventing Windows from logging off, and the remote access cant go through. Even though this application was developed by our company, I believe this is a Windowsrelated issue.p  pIs there any way I can accomplish to remote access the machine, maybe setting a Windows property or setting that would force all the applications to terminate every time I try to logoff p

Negative 34595 pI am creating a granular permissions system and am having trouble deciding the best way to go about it. The database I am using is Postgres.p  pBasically, I will have 3 tablesp  precodepermissions  pid, name, description  permissionsgroups  pgid, name, description  permissionsusers  puid, userid codepre  pAnything ending in id will be an codeintegercode, the rest will be codevarcharcode or codetextcode.p  pThe permissions system will be a part of a greater system where I rely on the user ID from another table.p  pHeres where I am stuck. I have two ideasp  h3Idea 1h3  pcodepermissionsgroupcode will have a column called codepermissionscode which will be an integer array. This will contain all codepidcodes for that permissions group.p  pcodepermissionsuserscode will have a column called codepgidscode which will be an integer array containing all permission groups a user has, and a column called codepermissionscode int array which have all codepidcodes of assigned permissions which do not belong in a group.p  pSample datap  precodepermissions  1, adduser, Can create a user 2, deleteuser, Can delete a user 3, viewusers, Can view all users 4, randomperm, Some example permission  permissionsgroups  1, usermanagement, User management, [1,2,3]  This group contains permissions 1,2, and 3  permissionsusers  1, 1, [1], [4]  This user links to user with id of 1, has permissions group 1 and permission 4 codepre  h3Idea 2h3  pThe second idea is more classic SQL. The 3 tables will stay the same. There will be 2 new tablesp  precodepermissionsgroupslink  pglid, pgid, pid  permissionsuserslink  pulid, puid, pid, pgid codepre  pNow it will work like thisp  precodepermissionsusers[puid]      V permissionsuserslink[puid]      V pid        OR        pgid                           V                     V permissions[pid] lt permissionsgroups[pgid] codepre  pSample datap  precodepermissions  1, adduser, Can create a user 2, deleteuser, Can delete a user 3, viewusers, Can view all users 4, randomperm, Some example permission  permissionsgroups  1, usermanagement, User management  permissionsgroupslink  1, 1, 1 2, 1, 2 3, 1, 3  Assign permissions 1,2, and 3 to group 1  permissionsusers  1, 1  permissionsuserslink  1, 1, 4, NULL 2, 1, NULL, 1  Assign permission 4 to user 1  Assign group 1 to user 1 codepre  h3Summaryh3  pIn the end, all this data will be aggregated into a list containing all permissions a user has, regardless of group. So with the above examples, the serverside code will aggregate all of that intop  precodePermissions for user 1 1 gt adduser 2 gt deleteuser 3 gt viewusers 4 gt randomperm codepre  pThe groups will serve only for visual distinction and easy application of permissions per user.p  h3My questionsh3  pWhich one of those ideas would scale best and be the fastest Assume that in a live environment, there are 10000 users and 1000 permissions and each user has on average 500 permissions.p  pOr are both ideas really bad and have I overlooked some fundamental RDBMS concepts that would make it easierp
