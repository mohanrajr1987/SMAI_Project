Negative 375 pFINAL EDIT This turned out to be a stack overflow problem related to neither string functions nor malloc. The GDB output said the problem was a few lines above where it was and got me confused, but as soon as I took the time to run in Valgrind I got it figured out. p  pIve written a bidirectional breadth first search program for finding shortest paths within a very large directed graph 6 million nodes. With a test input file of 100 nodes, everything works great. With the full inputs, much more memory is used, and the program then has a segmentation fault. p  pGDB says its segfaulting at the start of the search function, when I clean the result buffer at coden  sprintfresult, code. Heres the relevant functionp  precodechar bidirbfsint x, int y, char result     int n     n  sprintfresult,      ... codepre  pHeres the call to it and the allocation of the coderesultcode bufferp  precodeint main      int n0     char result     result  char mallocsizeofchar2000     ifresult  NULL         printfMALLOC FAILED exit1      Methods for initializing graph     readStructureFromFile      calcArticlesIn      Search the graph     result  bidirbfs1,2, result     printfsn, result     ...  codepre  pAgain, with small inputs everything works. When I use the fullsize inputs, the program reads everything in fine, but then segfaults.. When I instead use a very similar call to strncpy to empty the array, I get the same behavior, so it seems like its a general problem with string functions. Im not sure what could be going on. p  pIt seems like sprintf doesnt like the pointer its getting, which makes me wonder if malloc is doing something odd. When using the full inputs, malloc gets called 13 million times, so I wonder if it might be showing odd behavior because of this and overwriting the string buffer with something weird. At the same time, Im very hesitant to blame the library. p  pAny ideas what could be going onp  pSadly I think this is actually necessary. Each element in the graph has an array for inbound edges and outbound edges. Each arrays size is unknown until the inputs are read, so it has to be dynamically allocated to the correct size by malloc.p  pEDIT Valgrind returned the following. Im working on figuring out what it might mean, but at first glance it might actually be some kind of stack overflow. p  precode27263 Warning client switching stacks  SP change 0xbea50634 gt 0xbb815340 27263          to suppress, use maxstackframe52671220 or greater 27263 Invalid write of size 4 27263    at 0x8048D78 bidirbfs loaddata.c184 27263    by 0x80491CD main loaddata.c304 27263  Address 0xbb815348 is on thread 1s stack 27263  27263  27263 Process terminating with default action of signal 11 SIGSEGV 27263  Access not within mapped region at address 0xBB815348 27263    at 0x8048D78 bidirbfs loaddata.c184 27263  If you believe this happened as a result of a stack 27263  overflow in your programs main thread unlikely but 27263  possible, you can try to increase the size of the 27263  main thread stack using the mainstacksize flag. 27263  The main thread stack size used in this run was 8388608. 27263  27263 Process terminating with default action of signal 11 SIGSEGV 27263  Access not within mapped region at address 0xBB81533C 27263    at 0x401F4DD vgnUfreeres vgpreloaded.c58 27263  If you believe this happened as a result of a stack 27263  overflow in your programs main thread unlikely but 27263  possible, you can try to increase the size of the 27263  main thread stack using the mainstacksize flag. 27263  The main thread stack size used in this run was 8388608. 27263  27263 HEAP SUMMARY 27263     in use at exit 1,021,539,288 bytes in 13,167,791 blocks 27263   total heap usage 13,167,792 allocs, 1 frees, 1,047,874,864 bytes allocated 27263  27263 LEAK SUMMARY 27263    definitely lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 27263    indirectly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 27263      possibly lost 0 bytes in 0 blocks 27263    still reachable 1,021,539,288 bytes in 13,167,791 blocks 27263         suppressed 0 bytes in 0 blocks 27263 Rerun with leakcheckfull to see details of leaked memory 27263  27263 For counts of detected and suppressed errors, rerun with v 27263 ERROR SUMMARY 1 errors from 1 contexts suppressed 12 from 7 codepre  pEDIT 2  Final solution it was a stack overflow. Right after the sprintf statement I created an a array whose size is proportional to the number of nodes. Since I wasnt using malloc, this was created directly on the stack, overflowing it. Changing to use malloc solved the problem and everything now runs as expected. Thanks to everyone for the suggestionsp
Negative 375 pI am using the BMC latex template and need assistance with the referencing part.p  pThe reference for a journal article in the template is as follows   p  pSmith J, Jones M Jr, Houghton L.
