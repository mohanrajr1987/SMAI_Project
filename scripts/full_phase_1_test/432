Positive 432 pHi I have a question on Java Package. I have created a package with more than one classes [package name is animal and file name is Zoo.java]. I have created another java file which is in another package mypackage and created a file called MAIN.java. I tried accessing members of the animal package from MAIN.java and it is throwing me an error because it cannot access classes of animal package. I know that only classes which are in same package should be accessible each other, or it should make as public. But I can only change one class to public in Zoo.java. So I found one solution that create separate java files for each class in animal package and make it as public. Is there any other method  My understanding was, we can write all classes in one file and import them from anywhere. Below is my screenshot. a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comqjys6.jpg relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comqjys6.jpg altenter image description hereap  pAnd one more thing, in java library how they are implemented it separate source files for each class within a package   p
