Negative 4587 pThe majority of code examples I can find for working with Powershell and C involve the use of PSobjects to return data from the Powershell scripts.  A large amount of examples on creating a PSObject involve taking data from GetWMIObject and converting it to a PSObject.  This is done manually specifying each property to be carried over into the new PSObject from the results.  Is there anyway to dynamically convert the results from GetWMIObject whihc I believe is a ManagementObject to a PSObject in Powershellp  pBasically Id want a function where regardless of what class of WMIObject Id be using Id be able to convert into a PSObject.  Ive come across the .PSObject.Members call that can be used on the results of a GetWMIObject call just .PSObject doesnt seem to actually be anything valid.  So I am able to do the followingp  precodeclass  Win32ComputerSystem psObject  NewObject PSObject properties  GetWMIObject Class class.PSObject.Members  where membertype match Property  foreachproperty in properties      psObject  AddMember NoteProperty property.name Value property.value  psObject codepre  pBut this gives me a much larger amount of results I would normally get from just calling GetWMIObject.  Does anyone know a better way of converting or a way to further trim down these results to be closer to the standard output  I would want it to remain generic where I could change the value of class to any of the other WMIObject classes and it would still work.p
