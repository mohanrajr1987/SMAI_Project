Positive 6554 pId like to make my images square without affecting their aspect ratio, so I need to pad out the canvas size for example to make the height as large as the width and then I can rescale the image.

This is very similar to the question posted a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions26064458callingimagemagickcomfromvbscriptinexcelherea, but I have not been able to find a solution to that so far.p  pSecond, I tried just calling ImageMagick using the codeShellcode commandp  pre classlangvb prettyprintoverridecodePrivate Sub CommandButtonOkayClick     Dim sURL As String, sNetFile As String, sLocalFile As String,          cmd As String, RetVal As Integer     sURL  UserForm1.TextBoxImgURL     sLocalFile  Ctemp amp UserForm1.TextBoxName     DownloadFile sURL, sLocalFile  Function to download image from a URL and save it to a local directory     RetVal  Shellconvert.exe  amp sLocalFile amp   amp sLocalFile amp .jpg     UserForm1.Hide End Sub codepre  pWhen I run this, the image gets downloaded just fine, but the image isnt converted and no error is thrown.
