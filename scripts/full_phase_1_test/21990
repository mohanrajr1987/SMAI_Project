Proper validation of emeach form in the formsetem is entirely conditional based on a value from the main form e.g. check a box on the main form, and a specific field on emeach form in the formsetem suddenly becomes required.p  pMy intuition is to simply pass the entire main form into the formset validation call, like sop  precodedef myviewrequest     MyFormSet  formsetfactoryMyForm, extra2, canorderTrue      if request.method  POST         form  MainFormrequest.POST         formset  MyFormSetrequest.POST          if form.isvalid and formset.isvalidform  lt               The formset is now validated based on the form codepre  pHowever, to make that work, I believe I would have to override both the formset codeisvalidcode along with the underlying form codeisvalidcode and codecleancode method.

Negative 21990 pIm working with cocos2dx 2.0.4.

I have two ideas to do that but Im not sure if it is the correct way to do. First solution would be to triangulate the polygon containing only the blurred color concave polygon with a hole in this case and rendering color on it with a gradient, vertices on the outside of the polygon would be fullalpha and vertices on the inside zeroalpha. The interpolation would do the job of gradient then. Second solution would be to do it inside the shader itself. All I need is to calculate the distance from a pixel and the closest edge of the polygon to it. Then under a certain threshold I affect pixel white color with a certain alpha value depending on that distance the shortest the distance is, the biggest alpha is.p  pAnyway I am very new to openGL stuff and I am afraid that the second solution will end up with big processing time as I have to calculate the distance for every pixel of the polygon. What do you think about this guys Any ideas the tend to confirm my guesses or am I completely wrong on thisp  pEDIT The solution I finally chose was to use the bisector of every angle easy to calculate with 3 consecutive vertices in the polygon and take a point on that bisector that would become a vertex for the inner polygon. Then i take either a outer polygon vertex or a inner polygon vertex to build an array of vertices that can fit the GLTRIANGLESTRIP parameter. I put the image below to understand better.p  pimg srchttpimg571.imageshack.usimg571892convexpolyexplanation.png altexplp
