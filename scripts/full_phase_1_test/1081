Positive 1081 pIn the last week I worked with Java Web Start. I can successfully start applications and applets with JWS. But for one project I have to determine how to start multiple applets via JWS, which should not open in browser but in appletviewer. p  pMy searches always came to one result Appletviewer can only be started over command line. Is that right Is there no possibility to give an instruction in my HTML page or something like that, which would bring the applet to be started with the appletviewerp  h3Edith3  pOk, for all those who could search for this in futurebr Appletviewer is only for development purposes and the only way to start it strongisstrong the command line commandp  precodeappletviewer myAppletSite.html codepre  pBut if you really want to start it automatically, you could write an java application to run this system commandp  precodeRuntime.getRuntime.execappletviewer myAppletSite.html codepre

Positive 1081 pCurrently my company has an applet that downloads a JAR file to open up and listen to changes in a chosen file, a .doc for example. Then, these changes are uploaded back to our server.p  pApplets are dying and that is a big problem for us. We thought and still are thinking of ways to replace this. JWS, Plugins, Adobe Air, Native Messaging, Active X. A lot of things were considered and some tested with no luck, like the JWS. But now we are thinking that the best solution could be URL Handlers.p  pWe would have a desktop application that could intercept a URL with the information of the file, download it and then listen for changes.p  pMy questions are Are we going in the right direction Im afraid of choosing another soontobedead technology. And can it be done well with Java All of my actual code the jar file is in Java, and my intent was keeping it.p  p99 of our clients use Windows, so we could focus on that for now.p

Blog entries and the like are very welcome.p  pstrongUpdate 1strongp  pLooking through the limitations of using schemaless changes, different namespaces seems like the only sure method.  However, its not quite working as expected, e.g. belowp  precode[ServiceContract     Name  IServiceContract,     Namespace  httpmyurl201205] public interface IServiceContract1       Some operations   [ServiceContract     Name  IServiceContract,     Namespace  httpmyurl201206] public interface IServiceContract2       Some different operations using new DataContracts  codepre  pWith the following servicep  precodepublic class MyService  IServiceContract1, IServiceContract2       Implement both operations  codepre  pand the following configp  precode  ltservice behaviorConfigurationWcfServiceTests.ServiceBehavior     nameTest.MyServicegt     ltendpoint       address201205       bindingwsHttpBinding       contractTest.IServiceContract1gt       ltidentitygt         ltdns valuelocalhost gt       ltidentitygt     ltendpointgt     ltendpoint       address201206       bindingwsHttpBinding       contractTest.IServiceContract2gt       ltidentitygt         ltdns valuelocalhost gt       ltidentitygt     ltendpointgt     ltendpoint addressmex bindingmexHttpBinding contractIMetadataExchange gt   ltservicegt codepre  pResults in two contracts with two different names, I expected that I can point my clients to,p  pa hrefhttpmyurl.comMyService.svc201205 relnofollowhttpmyurl.comMyService.svc201205a  for the old version, and a hrefhttpmyurl.comMyService.svc201206 relnofollowhttpmyurl.comMyService.svc201206ap  p, but it seems like if I want to preserve the ServiceContract name they have to be two separate services rather than separate endpoint addresses for the same servicep  pstrongUpdate 2strongp  pI ended up using the method I have described under strongupdate 1strong.  Whilst the WSDL looks wrong, the service is indeed backwards compatible under older clients when Ive tested this.p
Negative 1081 psince I upgraded my Xcode project to Xcode 6, my storyboard localizations dont work. I havep  ul liA base localization as storyboard file which is basically Englishli liFour string files English, German, French and Japaneseli ul  pUntil Xcode 5 those worked without any problems.p  pBut since Xcode 6 I have the following situationp  ol liThe application only uses the labels used in the base file when running on a devicesimulatorli liBUT my Localizable.strings file, which I have in different languages for all nonstoryboard related localizations, works perfect. So in the end I have a mixture of languages while running on a deviceli liSince Xcode 6 there is the possibility to see the localizations as a preview screen in the assistant editor. Everything works there.li ol  pSo the only thing that doesnt work is the localization of the storyboard while runningp  pDoes anyone else have the same problem and is there a solutionp  pstrongUpdatestrong With Xcode 6.1 GM the localization on the actual device is correct now but the simulator is English only, even if I choose another language in the simulator.p
Negative 1081 pI am currently running Pythons Numpy fft on 44100Hz audio samples which gives me a working frequency range of 0Hz  22050Hz thanks Nyquist. Once I use fft on those time domain values, I have 128 points in my fft spectrum giving me 172Hz for each frequency bin size. p  pI would like to tighten the frequency bin to 86Hz and still keep to only 128 fft points, instead of increasing my fft count to 256 through an adjustment on how Im creating my samples.p  pThe question I have is whether or not this is theoretically possible. My thought would be to run fft on any Hz values between 0Hz to 11025Hz only. I dont care about anything above that anyway. This would cut my working spectrum in half and put my frequency bins at 86Hz and while keeping to my 128 spectrum bins. Perhaps this can be accomplished via a window function in the time domainp  pCurrently the code Im using to create my samples and then convert to fft isp  precodeimport numpy as np  samplerate  44100 chunk  128 recordseconds  2  stream  self.audio.openformatpyaudio.paInt16, channels1,                         ratesamplerate, inputTrue, framesperbuffer6300  samplelist  []  for i in range0, intsamplerate  chunk  recordseconds     data  stream.readchunk     samplelist.appendnp.fromstringdata, dtypenp.int16   then later   for samp in samplelist         sampfft  np.fft.fftsamp ... codepre  pI hope I worded this clearly enough. Let me know if I need to adjust my explanation or terminology.p

Negative 1081 pIn XCode, if I click on my TargetgetInfo and go to the Properties tab I see that the Creator field has  in it.  Is this just simply a field to insert the name of the companyindividual that is making the application or is it for something elsep  pAlso, does the Version field drive when an .ipa file is dragged into iTunes  whether or not this version of the file replaces another version.  I ask because I recently made an adhoc distribution and when users dragged it in to iTunes even though iTunes would prompt the user about replacing the existing version, it would not replace it.  We had to delete the app, sync, redrag and drop the .ipa, and resync.p  pAny help would be great.p
Negative 1081 pI am designing a class for my Java program and doubt whether I should use inner class in this case.p  pFor example, I have created a class called codeStudentcodep  precodepublic class Student      private String name     private int age     ...     private Mark mark     ...  codepre  pcodeMarkcode is another class contains the students mark for the following three subjects Math, Physics, Chemistryp  precodepublic class Mark      private double math     private double physics     private double chemistry      public Markdouble math, double physic, double chemistry          this.math  math         this.physics  physics         this.chemistry  chemistry            getters and setters     ...  codepre  pDo I need to define the class codeMarkcode in the class codeStudentcode as an inner class, or use codeMarkcode as a composition of class codeStudentcode I know that as an inner class, codeMarkcode will have access to the members of codeStudentcode. In case it is not necessary, are there any other differencesp
