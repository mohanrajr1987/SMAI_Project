Positive 186 pIs there any kind of test framework for Erlang which is similar to a hrefhttpdoc.akka.iodocsakkasnapshotscalatesting.htmlAsynchronousIntegrationTestingwithTestKit relnofollowTestKita in Akka p  pThe goal is to test processes in an integrated environment, for example, to send some messages to a group of processes on one end and assert the resulting messages coming out on the other end. The Akka Testkit makes these kinds of tests fairly straightforward, but I have not been able to find the equivalent in Erlang yet.p  pEDIT as the simplest example of what Im looking for, lets say that we have a process A that is expected to send a message to process B, and I would like to test this behaviour. p  pIn Akka, I can instantiate an actor based on the TestKit class, which has a builtin method codeexpectMsgcode. So my test looks like thisp  ul liinstantiate a mock B actorli liinstantiate the A actor which gets a reference to B somehowli lisend A a messageli licall B.expectMsg to verify that it received the message note that   ul lithis automatically makes sure that no other type of message is sent to B, andli liyou can optionally provide a timeoutli ulli ul  pIs there a library that supports this kind of workflow in Erlang As far as I know neither EUnit nor CT support this kind of testing.p  pTo get an idea of the more complex assertions, please see this page a hrefhttpdoc.akka.ioapiakka2.0akkatestkitTestKit.html relnofollowhttpdoc.akka.ioapiakka2.0akkatestkitTestKit.htmlap
