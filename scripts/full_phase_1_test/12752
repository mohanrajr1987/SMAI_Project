Positive 12752 pI have a Firefox add on that displays a popup when it sees a certain response header. This works fine when I have a single window. However, when I have multiple windows open, and one of the tabs in a window triggers the popup code in my addon due to the presence of said header I get a popup in each of my open windows.

Negative 12752 pIm interested in changing our contactrelationshipmanagement system to Googles Cloud SQL, but I cant seem to find a good modular, customizable, frontend application that can utilize it.p  pI know a little bit of Java and SQL, but having only made a few small applications and a few queries, starting a project of this magnitude from scratch is daunting.p  pId prefer a RAD tool that can develop a frontend for the users. Our current CRM application, Sage ACT 2009, has a layout editor that feels just like Visual Basics designer. It also handles all the backend SQL stuff. This is basically what I want, but needs the ability to connect to a remote database.p  pGoogle Apps integration would rock, but I know nothing about web applications or GAE. We have Google Apps for Business.p  pIn short, I want either customizable frontend database client software focused on users, not on database administration, or a RAD tool that is somewhat CRMoriented and works with SQL out of the box.p
