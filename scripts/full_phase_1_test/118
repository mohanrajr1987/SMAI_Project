Positive 118 pI have been using c for long time and I am not good at Delphi XE. But for reason, I have to port my c code to Delphi to implement the following task. I have a main TForm which I obtained the code from someone else. In the TForm, I have 2 private objects and procedures defined to finish some task. My task is to create a thread to call those classes and procedures for some calculation. p  precodeTASKForm  classTForm   private     MonitorA TMonClassA     ConstB TConstClassB      procedure calculateStmp end codepre  pThis task could be done easily in c if I extend TASKForm with multiinheritance. But after some research, I found that Delphi doesnt support that. So I need to think of other way. I then saw an article about using the nested class.p  precodeTASKForm  classTForm   protected     TMyThread  classTThread       public         procedure Execute override  inside this I need to call TASKForm.MonitorA.somemethod, TASKForm.ConstB.somemethod and TASKForm.calculateStmp     end   private     MonitorA TMonClassA     ConstB TConstClassB      procedure calculateStmp end codepre  pBut I soon find that the procedure defined in the nested class cannot access the containers private members. I wonder if there is any other way I can create an thread to call one classs private functions and variables Thanks.p  hr  pcode updated. I am trying two more schemes. The first one is to use interface likep  precodeTmyThread  interfaceTThread end  TASKForm  classTForm, TmyThread private   MonitorA TMonClassA   ConstB TConstClassB    procedure calculateStmp end codepre  pBut it does not work because TThread is not a type of interface. I am trying to use Application.ProcessMessages, like the followingp  precodeprocedure TASKForm.RunMyTask   while not RunTerminated do  RunTerminated will be set when an external event triggered   begin     MonitorA.Somemethod     calculateStmp     ConstB.Somemethod     Application.ProcessMessages   end end codepre  pI will say this method is ok but not perfect because the MonitorA.Somemethod and ConstB.Somemethod may take long or short time to run the time is not constant so sometimes when external event triggered to set RunTerminated True, it will not terminate the while loop immediately. I am still looking for the method of multithreading. p
Positive 118 pI want to run a command that the user defined in an INI file.p  pThe commands can be EXE files, or other files e.g. DOC files and parameters should be allowed.p  pSince WinExec can handle arguments e.g. cmd , but ShellExec can handle NonEXE files e.g. Letter.doc, I am using a combination of these both.p  pI am concerned about future Windows versions, because WinExec is deprecated, and even from the 16 bit era.p  pHere is my current functionp  precodeprocedure RunCMDcmdLine string WindowMode integer    procedure ShowWindowsErrorMessager integer   begin     MessageDlgSysErrorMessager, mtError, [mbOK], 0   end  var   r, g Cardinal begin    We need a function which does following    1.
