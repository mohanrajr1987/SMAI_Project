Positive 1609 pMy springws project contains multiple xsd files. Each file defines a single type and the corresponding java file is generated by xjc. I reference common base types with xsdimport, and xjc has no problem handling these.p  pMy problem is with exposing these xsds from DefaultWsdl11Definition. p  pI tried creating SimpleXsdSchema for each xsd and returning them from an XsdSchemaCollection. This works, but the generated WSDL file contains multiple schema entries and xsdimport statements. It looks as if the files are simply copypasted one after another into the wsdl. Im not sure if this will a problem for clients.p  pNext, I tried creating a CommonsXsdSchemaCollection. But I get XmlSchemaException Schema name conflict in collection. I guess it doesnt like my xsds sharing a common namespace.p  pWhat is the recommended approach here Should I give up separating my types into multiple Xsds and work with a single one Can jaxb combine my xsds into a single one p
