Positive 2548 pI have two servers on the same local network 192.168.10. the main server is set to 192.168.10.5 IP1 and it is running a c application that UDP communicates with some network devices the other server is the backup of the main one, and it is 192.168.10.6 IP2 but the c application is not running.  On both servers is running a task and its main purpose is to set the IP of the server to IP1, with a netsh script, if there is no IP1 server in the netwwork and then run the main c application, or set the server to IP2, if IP1 already exists.p  pThe problem is if one of the server shuts down with the IP1 address assigned, the other one immediately gets the IP1, but when the other server turns on again it gives me an IP conflict. So I need to start the server with a third IP addr IP3 before it connects to the local network, and then configure it , depending on what is running. p  pI have this problem because the UPD devices need a remote IP address to communicate with and the server backup must be automated.p  psorry for my bad englishp  pthank you guys. p
Positive 2548 pI am building a simple peer to peer application where about 8 participants all connect to each other codenncode. I will be using UDP with a reliability and ordering protocol layered on top. Each peer will be broadcasting a few KB of data per second. p  pIt occurred to me that there are two ways of configuring the ports on each peer p  ol liEach peer takes one port and all messages are received via that li liEach peer takes a port for each other peer, and only communicates with a peer using its corresponding portli ol  pWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of each approachp
Positive 2548 pI was doing a simple server client console chat box in winsock2.Then my colleague asked me if i can do a single server multi client connection in which the SERVER will be in TCP and the CLIENTS will be in UDP. Also the client does not know the IP of the server but knows the port number i.e the Client has to search for the server and then connect it.All this over a LAN.p  pCould any one tell me how to do such program or if possible could post a code for reference.p

Positive 2548 pHi guys im developing an application in c with a server and lots of clients, i need them to comunicate in particular the server must sends one packets to all the client, this hapens at random time  it sends the packet only when another program send a signal that i capture. I didnt want to use TCP because this must be as fast as possible and because i have lots of client  they can be more than a thousand.p  pI tried some solution with UDP, with broadcast and multicast and also with a loop sending the packets to all of them singularly. I tested it with 1 server and 2 clients, both of these solution works fine when they are on the same machine but when i put it on the internet server on a machine and the client on another machine in different network the program doesnt work anymore, the clients dont receive anything.p  pSenderp  precodeprivate void sendstring packet           code to get the key to encript the data           byte[] bytes  Encryptor.EncryptStringpacket, key           query  SELECT ip FROM utenti WHERE ID ltgt 2         Listltstringgt ips  SelectIPsquery          foreach string ip in ips             if ip                   continue             UdpClient client  new UdpClient             IPAddress address  IPAddress.Parseip             IPEndPoint ipEndPoint  new IPEndPointaddress, 16759             client.Sendbytes, bytes.Length, ipEndPoint             client.Close                   codepre  pReceiverp  precodeprivate void receivestring packet        receivingUdpClient  new UdpClient16759        RemoteIpEndPoint  new IPEndPointIPAddress.Parse185.43.209.118, 0        byte[] receiveBytes  receivingUdpClient.Receiveref RemoteIpEndPoint          code to get the key to decrypt          string returnData  Encryptor.DecryptStringreceiveBytes, key         Console.WriteLinereturnData        return  codepre  pI posted the solution with the loop in the send but i also tried with broadcast and multicast.p  pAny suggestion on what to do and why i dont receive anything if they are on different machinep
