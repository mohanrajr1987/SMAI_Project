Positive 99 pRecently i installed prerooted lollipop 14.5.A.0.270 on my Sony Z1C and noticed that space on internal storage notably reduced, and here the result of my df command.

Positive 99 pI was working with some maintenance folks to try and replace a dead hard drive on a station running RHEL5 old, I know.... Instead of getting some brand new drives, they used some drives from an old server that is no longer operational. The system did recognize this new drive, however this drive contains a volume group that is conflicting with an existing volume group on my system. Additionally, since the duplicate volume group belonged to an old system it is complaining that none of the physical volumes can be located due to different UUIDs in the new system.p  pI need to remove the duplicate volume group. Ive tried the following steps alreadyp  ol licodevgreduce removemissing vg01codeli licodevgrename UUID oldvgcode complains about missing physical volumesli liI cant use codepvremovecode because the groups I need to remove dont have a path assigned to them unknown device and it doesnt appear that I can use codepvremovecode with a UUID.li ol  pTLDR Two volume groups both with name vg01. Need to remove the duplicate vg01 as well as its associated missing physical volumes.p  pAnd yes I know this could have all been avoided if we had just used brand new hard drives...p

Negative 99 pHey, I have a server application which accepts incomming queries and executes them. If there are too many queries they should be queued and if some of the other queries got executed the queued queries should be executed as well. Since I want to pass queries with different priorities I think using a priorityqueue would be the best choice. p  pe.g. The amout of the axcepting queries a hit the limt and new queries will be stored in the queue. All queries have a priority of 1 lowest if some of the queries from a get executed the programm will pick the query with the highest priority out of the queue and execute it. Still no problem. Now someone is sending a query with a priority of 5 which gets added to the queue. Since this is the query with the highest priority the application will execute this query as soon as the running queries no longer hit the  limit. There might be the worst case that 500 queries with a priority of 1 are queued but wont be executed since someone is always sending queries with a priority of 5 hence these 500 queries will be queued for a looooong time. In order to prevent that I want to increase the prioritiy of all queries which have a lower priority than the query with the higher priority, in this example which have a priority lower than 5. So if the query with a priority of 5 gets pulled out of the queue all other queries with a priority lt 5 should be increased by 0.2. This way queries with a low priority wont be queued for ever even if there might be 100 queries with a higher priority.p  pI really hope someone can help me to solve the problem with the prioritiesp  pSince my queries consist of an object I thought something like this might workp  precodeclass Query  public     Query stdstring pstQuery   stQuery pstQuery       stdstring getQuery const return stQuery     void increasePriority const float fIncrease  fPriority  fIncrease      friend bool operator lt  const Queryamp PriorityFirst, const Queryamp PriorityNext           if PriorityFirst.fPriority lt PriorityNext.fPriority               if PriorityFirst.fStartPriority lt PriorityNext.fStartPriority                   Query qTemp  PriorityFirst                 qTemp.increasePriority INCREASERATE                            return true          else              return false                private     static const float INCREASERATE  0.2     float fPriority  current priority     float fStartPriority  initialised priority     stdstring stQuery  codepre
Negative 99 pstackoverflow fellows,p  pSince I am very new in Cloud Computing matters, I would like to ask you a question Google Cloud Messaging for Android works from server to client, but also viceversafrom client to server p  pI am asking you this, because I am currently developing an Android application. The structure, in general lines, its something like I would like to use my laptop as a server  and perform all the computations here. Then, from my server laptop, to send everything in the cloud, and from the cloud, directly to my Android running device. I want to perform the computing and database storage on my local server because, since I am a student, I wont have enough money to actually pay for a server from google lets say, so I am focusing on whats free and suitable to my needs and just communicate with my Android device using Google Cloud Messaging for Android. I want my application to be independent from the hardware of my mobile device, and also, I want to write the program that will perform the computations on my server in Java.p  pI know that I can send messages from the server to my devicethrough cloud, but the question is can I also send messages from my device to the server  I am asking this, because the computations will be made after I submit something from my device basically, my Android application will be an interface, from where I can send the data to my server through cloud and then receive also through cloud the results of the computation on my devicep  pAccording to what Ive been currently reading a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comgooglegcmindex.html relnofollowhttpdeveloper.android.comgooglegcmindex.htmla it seems that I can only send messages from the server to my device, but I decided to ask, since, so far, was the only free messaging frameworkusing cloud I have found.p  pThank you.p
