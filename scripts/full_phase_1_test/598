Positive 598 pin my local machine I am running an web application in JBoss server. I am using JVisual VM for profiling my application. When I am trying to pointconnect to JBoss with JVisual VM, My application is getting tremendously slow or its getting downnot working any more. p  pI want to do instrumentation profiling to get the actual memory usage for various objects. p  pOS Windows 7 Enterprise Processor Core 2 Duo 3.00GHz 3.00GHz RAM 4.00 GBp  pAny suggestion or help would be highly appreciated.p  pCheers, Ehteshamp
Positive 598 pIm developing a game where I have lots of collisions, and it rapidly came to notice that my bottleneck is this linep  precodeifPoint.distancepoint1, point2 lt collisionDistance   do stuff  codepre  pwhere point1 and point2 are static variables that store the positions of objects that could collide if the collisionDistance is low enough. p  pDo you know of any more performant method to check a simple collision between two circles.p
Positive 598 pI am trying to use a comparator to help sort a list of objects. I have a question about how exactly the comparator works and what it would be doing exactly in the following examplep  precodeprivate static ComparatorltStudentgt comparator          return Student a, Student b gt                            return Integer.comparecomplexOperationa, complexOperationb           codepre  pAs you can see above, there is a need to compare and sort students according to an integer rank returned by the codecomplexOperationcode method. As the name suggests, it is a heavy operation. Would the above approach be the most efficient Or would it be better to essentially run through each student in the list I am trying to sort, perform the codecomplexOperationcode per student and store the result in a field in the Student object. Then the comparator would just do anp  precodeInteger.comparea.getRank, b.getRank codepre  pWould both these approaches be comparable or, due to the way the comparator works perhaps compares the same object more than once with others hence running complexOperation multiple times per Student during the compare, would it be faster to do the pre computation of the complexOperation result in a student fieldp  pThe above would be called like so p  precodeCollections.sortstudents, comparator codepre  pHope that was clearp  pEdit Lets say, for the sake of it, it is not possible to add a field to the Student object This is a toy problem for a more complex situation where I am not at liberty to modify the Student object. Would it still be better to perhaps create a custom Object with Student sitting inside with another field added rather than doing the complexOperation right in the comparator Or is there another way to approach the problem I can think of creating a Hashmap that takes student id as key and the result of the complexOperation as value and just createsaccess that record within the comparatorp

Positive 598 pI have used the sample from D3 brush snapping, ttpbl.ocks.orgmbostock6232537. All is working well with its 38 ticks, strange thing is that once the brush move to position 14extent0[0] to 30extent0[1], user can not move the end brush extent0[1]any more the cursor does not change to the dragbrush position as if the browser is not rendering the mouse event. However user can click anywhere on the brush to create a new extent pair for the brush. I googled some performance topic on the brush and some posts mentioned that if there are too many svg elements on the page, it could cause some lagging on the browserFirefox rendering, just to add that Im using chrome only.  Anyone has similar experience or any suggestions p
Positive 598 pI am working on an application, trying to improve performance. Obviously I will be doing my own profiling and testing, but I would like to know if there is a consensus or known best practice.p  pIn the old SQL days, one of the main things to do to improve efficiency was to not select data you arent going to consume. Im trying to go down that route with EF6.p  pIn this particular case, I have a masterdetaildetail relationship where I need to render some data about the parent, child, and grandchild on the screen.p  pMy application is ntier with an MVC front end, and a webapi REST backend. These entities are ultimately going to be serialized as JSON, sent over the rest connection back to the MVC controller, where they will be rendered to the screen. In this case I will not be updating the entities from this flow, so I dont need to worry about merging partial entities back into the repository in those cases, I would probably send over the full entity for ease of maintenance p  pSo, the original straightforward EF code I wrote looks like thisp  precodeRepository.GetAll           .AsNoTracking           .IncludeChildren           .IncludeChildren.GrandChildren           .ToList codepre  pHowever, I am only actually consuming a subset of the  properties of these entities, and some of the unused properties can be rather large big chunks of XML, etcp  pHere is a first pass at trying to project out only the fields I need for the example here, I have cut out and renamed most of the fields I would actually select to improve readability, but in general Im using lets say 520 of the full entitiesp  precodevar projection  Repository.GetAll             .AsNoTracking             .Selectr gt new                              r.Id,                 r.RandomId,                 r.State,                 r.RequestType,                 r.CreatedDate,                 r.CreatedBy,                 Children  r.Children.Selectr2 gt new                                      r2.Id,                     r2.Status,                     GrandChildren  r2.GrandChildren.Selectr3 gt new                                              r3.Id,                         r3.Status,                         r3.GrandChildType                                      ,                          .ToList codepre  pThis is obviously using anonymous types I believe this is required in EF there is not a way to project into a named type edit  apparently you can project into a nonmapped named type, but in this case, the return type of the query is a mapped type. So I could create a DTO, but thats even more code to maintainp  pso then I have to get back into my concrete types. I could certainly generate DTOs that only had the properties needed, but I dont think that changes the fundamental logic used, nor probably the performance characteristics.p  pI tried my standbys of Automapper and ValueInjecter, but neither one seemed to fit the bill perfectly here deep clone of heterogeneous types with matching names so I went dirtyp  precodevar json  projection.SelectJsonConvert.SerializeObject.ToList  var mapped  json.SelectJsonConvert.DeserializeObjectltParentgt.ToList codepre  pThis is somewhat lame since its just going to be serialized again as part of the rest call. There is probably a way I can override the webAPI calls to say I am returning the already serialized data, which would let me skip the rehydration into the entity type as all of the property names match, the rest client should be able to rehydrate the anonymous type as if it were the real type, the same way the snippet above doesp  pBUT all this seems like a lot of work, less maintainable code, more possible places to have bugs, etc for a use case that entity framework really does not seem to want to support. But my old school instincts cant let go of the idea that Im selecting, serializing, and transferring a whole lot of data that ultimately Im not going to consume. p  pDoes this produce sane SQL under the covers Is that worth the double serialization assuming I dont figure out how to override webapi to let me hand it the datap  pI suppose my other choice would be to refactor all the entities so that the unused properties are in different sub entities that I can just not include, but that would be a lot of rework throughout the system versus being able to surgically improve performance at critical points and it also seems like a poor choice to design entities around the ORM I happen to be using vs standard normalization rules etc.p
