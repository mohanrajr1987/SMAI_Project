Positive 66383 pI took over a CRM 2011 service calendar to manage appointments. Now I would like build a view searching for a selection appointments, that means within a time range and with certain attendees.p  pSo far I select Appointments and define the specific time range with Start Time on or after as the beginning and End Time on or before. Both times I combine it with AND and group all times with OR.p  pSubsequently I would like to specify the people who attended these appointments as shown within the appointment as required. But there is no field to filter those. This seems rather awkward because it is possible to select required attendees as a column to be displayed in the results.p  pIn short How can an user find all appointments from the Dynamics CRM 2011 Service Calendar of a time range AB with the attendees X, Y and Zp  pHelp is much appreciated Thanksp  pPS I already tried all kinds of ownership, but it does not work, because the attendees are not the ones creating, modifying or owning the appointments.p

Negative 66383 pIm using plain js to alter the inner text of a label element, and I wasnt sure on what grounds I should use innerHTML or nodeValue or textContent. I dont need to create a new node or change the HTML elements or anything just replace the text. Heres an example of the codep  precodevar myLabel  document.getElementByIdsomeLabel myLabel.innerHTML  Some new label text  this works  myLabel.firstChild.nodeValue  Some new label text  this also works.  myLabel.textContent  Some new label text  this also works. codepre  pI looked through the jQuery source, and it uses nodeValue exactly one time but innerHTML and textContent several times. Then I found this jsperf test that indicates the firstChild.nodeValue is significantly faster. At least thats what I interpret it to mean. p  pIf firstChild.nodeValue is so much faster, whats the catch Is it not widely supported Is there some other issuep
