Positive 72 pSo I have combed through multiple pages of stackoverflow questions and it seems like I keep getting close but dont get the exact results I need...so I have succumbed to submitting this question.p  pTo start off this is on a SQL Server 2000 server...which sucks, I know.p  pI have 2 tables linking together in a sql query that is overall fairly basic. Sample data is listed below a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comd0Ca3.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comd0Ca3.png altCurrent Resultsap  pThe query I use to get that data isp  precodeSELECT DISTINCT AH.locationid as locationid ,AH.adate as date ,Min CASE WHEN Asum.code  201 THEN Amount END  AS attrib1 ,Min CASE WHEN Asum.code  204 THEN Amount END  AS attrib2 ,Min CASE WHEN Asum.code  206 THEN Amount END  AS attrib3 ,Min CASE WHEN Asum.code  212 THEN Amount END  AS attrib4 ,Min CASE WHEN Asum.code  215 THEN Amount END  AS attrib5 ,Min CASE WHEN Asum.code  218 THEN Amount END  AS attrib6 ,Min CASE WHEN Asum.code  221 THEN Amount END  AS attrib7 ,Min CASE WHEN Asum.code  231 THEN Amount END  AS attrib8 ,AH.checkid as checktype FROM [asum] ASum  INNER JOIN [Ahead] AH ON  Asum.AID  AH.AID  WHERE AH.code IN 212,201,206,204,215,218,221,231  AND AH.checkid ltgt c AND AH.checkid ltgt b  GROUP BY   AH.code ,ASum.amount ,AH.adate ,AH.checkid  ORDER BY   AH.locationid ,AH.adate ,attrib1 ,attrib2 ,attrib3 ,attrib4 ,attrib5 ,attrib6 ,attrib7 ,attrib8 ,AH.checkid codepre  pSo what I am trying to do is return the newest two dates for every location  and all of the attrib for those newest two dates. p  pSo I am essentially trying to get something that looks like this a hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comG0zNw.png relnofollowimg srchttpi.stack.imgur.comG0zNw.png altWanted Resultsap  pThe closest I have gotten is doing adding the below inner join code to the query and that gets me just the top date...the problem I face is how to get two max dates from this subquery that I innerjoin too.p  precode  INNER JOIN SELECT                  locationid,                 MAXadate as newest               FROM   ahead               GROUP BY locationid t1  ON t1.locationid  AH.locationid  AND t1.newest  AH.adate codepre  pSo with that inner join I just get 1 of each location id instead of two of each location id like I need. The rough part is that this is on a SQL Server 2000 database...UGH. p  pThanks so much in advance for any tipsadvicep

Positive 72 pI am trying to set up a query that will grab the Windows version of each SQL Server I have and throw it into a table. I have the query that grabs the version but I think there is a better way to get the information needed than connecting to each indiviual server one by one to run the query. I am not opposed to using XPcmdshell I am just wondering if there is a way to run one query that will grab the version of each Windows OS I have on the sql servers. Also I do have a list of servers to use. p  pEDIT I know I wil have to in some way touch each server. I would just like a way to get around having the RDP to each server and open SQL server and query it or haveing to connect to each server within sql server and running the query one by one.p  pAll I have right now code wise is a simple INSERT STATEMENT I get here and I draw a blank on where to go next of even hoe to tackle the problem.

Positive 72 pI have a question regarding Subscriptions for SQL Server Reporting Services, any help would be greatly appreciated.

Users then have to go back into the Subscriptions page and create a new Subscription which then again seems to vanish on its own.
