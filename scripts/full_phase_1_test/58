Positive 58 pSo if I use popen in the gcc stdio.h, I can pipe a parents stdout to its childs stdin, or I could pipe the childs stdout to the parents stdin. I want to do both at the same time. Is there a way to do this using popen, or do I need to make this work using lower level tools like shared memoryp  pNOTE It looks like in FreeBSD popen can be used readwrite with r. I do not understand exactly how the childs stdout is both piped to the parent and the parents stdout. Anyay, this would probably work for me, but it does not appear to be the case in Linux. If I am mistaken on this point, that would answer my question. Here is a link to where I am getting this note a hrefhttpswww.freebsd.orgcgiman.cgiquerypopenampsektion3 relnofollowhttpswww.freebsd.orgcgiman.cgiquerypopenampsektion3ap  pNOTE 2 I would prefer a solution that is portable accross just about every Linux distro, FreeBSD, and OSX, in order of priority. That being said, Id be happy to at least make it work in Ubuntu 14.04.p

Positive 58 pI know there is a thread on this site for creating a directory when using codecpcode but my question is a little different. I want to copy a file in a new destination in linux, but some part of the path might not exist and I wanted to know whether it is possible to create that path without separating directory name from file name, for example, imagine I have a variable that contains the prefix for new files codeprefixdircode and I want every file to be copied in that location.p  precodeprefixdirhomeakjnewpath listls somelocation... for l in list do    cp v l prefixdirl done codepre  pFrom the example it is obvious that there can be some directories that dont exist under new location and because of file names I cant use codemkdir prefixdirlcode. I know I can separate file name from directory name and then use codemkdircode but I was wondering if there were an elegant way to do that.p  pEDITp  pTo just clarify my question imagine I want to copy codelibtttest.socode and my codeprefixdircode is codehomeakjcode. Also imagine that codelibttcode doesnt exist, so my codecpcode command would fail. I also cant use codemkdir pcode because of codetest.socode in the path.p  pThanks.p
