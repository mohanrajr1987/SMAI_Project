Negative 11094 pI am working with flex for the last two years on some desktop apps. Until now I never had any performance related issues but today as we completed a mobile application for the iPad, Im facing a challenge, the application is incredibly slow on the iPad.p  pa hrefhttpi.stack.imgur.comqkbWn.png relnofollowhttpi.stack.imgur.comqkbWn.pngap  pSlow, means that when I press a button in the menu to change the splitview I must wait something like 5s. Then scrolling is really slow two, with less than one fps and my TextInput starts to bug the text is not in his box anymore.p  pI started to read a lot of blog post and presentation about optimisation for the mobile platform and then I rewrite some of the components I use. I removed the SkinnableContainer for instance and replaced it by a VGroup including some actionScript based drawing.p  pNow what you see is a VGroup the dark grey one containing some others VGroup the group with title here and then each widget is an HGroup with a label and a Widget. I only use Label and TextInput for the text.p  pCreation time is slow even several seconds to create the view for another page where there is only 4 text widget on it, or another one with only a list with a custom item renderer where each row is a set of 4 labels.p  pThe whole things is cabled with RobotLegs, with nothing fancy, one models is injected in the view and at the beginning I set a member variable on the view with this object to bind my variables.p  pFrankly my thinking right now is  it smells fishy because if Ive done everything right it is impossible to have such low performance and thinks that flex is competitive on the mobile platform. So right now Im trying to disable the application piece by piece to try to locate what could slow it like that. Ive got a couple suspects to check, for instance Ive got some binding warning to check, and then see if robotlegs has got its share of the problem.p  pSo my main question here is what do you think, and could you have some ideas about is there a problem and how do we solve it.p  pThanksp
