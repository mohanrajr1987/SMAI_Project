Positive 365 pIm developing a Chrome extension, and Im adding an codeonmouseovercode handler to each of the images on a page. When the user mouses over an image, its URL should be stored in a variable. I know I can easily get the value of the codesrccode attribute of the image, but I want the full URL. The codesrccode attribute stores the path of the image on the server. For example, when you right click an image in Google Chrome, you get the Copy Image URL option, which copies the images URL to the clipboard. p  pIs there any way to achieve this Thanks.p
