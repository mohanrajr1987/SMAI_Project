This connection is made with a single library function call, i.e. I cannot put progress updates in there and make callbacks or something similar.  p  pMy idea was to create a dialog with a progress bar in a separate thread before connecting to the DB. This dialog will continually change the progress status with codeCProgressCtrlStepItcode so the user sees something happening.br After that dialog is set up and doing its thing I want to call the DB connection function from the main thread. After the connection function completed, I want to stop the progress bar thread.p  pLet me paint a picturep  precodeCMyApp       ProgressThread InitInstance      .                    .                    .     Create Dialog                                      Animate  Connect          Progress     to             Bar     DB                                       Destroy Dlg                    .                    . codepre  pIs that possible If yes, howp  pMaybe the whole thing would work using timers, too. Would probably be much simpler but I couldnt get that to work either.p  ol liI am aware of codeCProgressCtrlSetMarqueecode which might do exactly what I need but I cant use it because the application does not have Unicode support.li liI could move the db connection call into a separate thread but that way it looks like a lot of changes to the code and extra handling of connection errors.li ol  pstrongUpdate 2strongbr I got it working the way AlexEzh and Javier De Pedro suggested Put the DB stuf into its own thread.br initially I had concerns about how error handling could be done but its actually quite similar to how it was before.p  ol liIn the main thread I create a struct with connection parameters, result flag and threadrunningflag. The latter is initially set to codetruecode.li liI create a thread and pass that struct as parameter.li liI create a dialog that displays a progress bar in the main thread.li liAlso in the main thread there is a loop that runs while the threadrunningflag is set. It calls codeCMyDialogAnimatecode which calls codeCProgressCtrlStepItcode and then codeSleepcodes a bit.li liThe thread executes the dbconnection code and sets the runningflag to codefalsecode when done.li liWhen the main thread exits the loop it can handle errors exactly as it did before.li ol  pstrongDisadvantagestrong Moving the mouse over the window doesnt work. Its invisible. Thus no cancelbutton or other interactive dialog elements can be used. I can live with that, however.p  pSince you liked the diagram, here is how it now looks likep  precodeCMyApp        WorkerThread InitInstance      .                    .                    .

Negative 470 pIm reading a hrefhttprads.stackoverflow.comamznclickB0097N8XBE relnofollowthis booka that teaches nonprogramers how to create iOS App. Its a step by step book.p  pTo create the App, we use Xcode.

Negative 470 pFor instance, suppose I have table A.  Then I have tables BZ that have a foreign key to table As primary key.  Then perhaps there are also some tables that have a foreign key constraint to a table in BZs primary key constraint.  Is there any easy way to clear out table A and all of the tables that refer to A or that refer to a table that refers to A without having to explicitly delete from each table or add an ON CASCADE constraint to each foreign keyp  pNote that this is mainly for testing purposes, not to be used in production.  I would just drop the entire schema and start over again, but that simply isnt feasible for every test considering how long it takes to build the schema.p
