Positive 76120 pI just started rails today and its very interesting. However, Ive come across a problem. Whatever goes into application.html.erb should be seen in other webpages such as the links, navbar. The problem is what Ive put into application.htlm.erb is not showing in the other pages. If I put 2 links into application it wont show on the other webpages, the only way I could see the links is because I manually inserted the code into the individual webpage. I dont know if its something wrong with application.html.erb itself, but I have 2 files in the layouts folder application.html, and application.html.erb. p  pIm also watching a video that goes along with my project, which means that I pretty much copied whatever the teacher was saying.p  pI really want to move on, but this problem is putting me back. If anyone can help please respondp
Positive 76120 pI am using cancan with a straight forward ability.rb file. Most of my abilities are rather a rather simple combo of crud rights on models limited by a users role. I just had to write a more complex ability using a block and now it appears that is causing a previous ability to be evaluated incorrectly. p  pThis was my original abilityp  precode only allowed to edit the company a user is assigned to            can crud, Company, id gt user.companyid  codepre  pI also allowed some roles to only have read privilegesp  precodecan read, Company, id gt user.companyid codepre  pNow I need to allow a role Company Admin to be able to viewread any company that is downstream from them in the hierarchy, i.e. we have a company tree and a company admin should have read privileges for all child node companies. p  pI accomplished this new ability like sop  precode Allow read access for downstream companies       can read, Company do  company               company.isdownstreamuser.companyid, company.id       end codepre  pThis works except that now my Company Admin role has full crud on all downstream Companies even though the first ability says a Company Admin should only have crud rights on his own Company. p  pIve tried changing the order in which these abilities are defined incase its a precedence issue but still get the same results. I dont know where to go from here any help would be appreciated p  pIts my belief that the first ability is using the company that the user belongs to to evaluate to true and for the read rule, its using the company thats passed into the block. I just dont know how to fix it.   p

Negative 76120 pIm looking for a data structure that can possibly outperform codeDictionaryltstring, objectgtcode. I have a map that has emNem items  the map is constructed once and then read many, many times. The map doesnt change during the lifetime of the program no new items are added, no items are deleted and items are not reordered. Because the map doesnt change, it doesnt need to be threadsafe, even though the application using it is heavily multithreaded. I expect that 50 of lookups will happen for items not in the map.p  pcodeDictionaryltTKey, TItemgtcode is quite fast and I may end up using it but I wonder if theres another data structure thats faster for this scenario. While the rest of the program is obviously more expensive than this map, it is used in performancecritical parts and Id like to speed it up as much as possible.p
