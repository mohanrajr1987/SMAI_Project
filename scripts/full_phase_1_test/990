I always retrieve emails by primary key so its fast. The hard drive is big. However, backups are slow.p  pstrongPossible solutionsimprovementsstrongp  pA possible improvement is to regenerate the contents of the email when the user clicks the link instead of storing the generated result in the database. However, the inputs may change in the meantime, and I want the email to be fixed  meaning that the user should see the email as it was at the time of sending.p  pAnother improvement might be to automatically delete stored emails older than X days. However, this means the link will stop working some day, depending on the X. A lower X is good for free space, but bad for the user. How to decide Xp  pThoughtsp
