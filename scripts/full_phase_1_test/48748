Negative 48748 pIm creating a webform vb.net project in visual studio 2012. I am also using Entity Framework for managing my objects. The big pain is caused by a View in my database, which I am forced to use.p  pI can retrieve the objects from this view with this classp  precodeImports System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations Public Class C     ltKey, StringLength6, DisplaynameCgt      Public Property IDC As String     ltDisplayNameDescrizione, StringLength255gt      Public Property Descrizione As String End Class codepre  pNow I would like to create a brand new model called S.

Negative 48748 pI just started C but have some prior knowledge to other languages vb awhile back unfortunately, but have an odd predicament. I disliked using so many IF statements and wanted to use switchcases as it seemed cleaner, and I wanted to get in the practice.. But..p  pLets say I have the following scenario theorietical codep  precodewhile1     Loop can be conditional or 1, I use it alot, for example in my game   char something   stdcout ltlt Enter somethingn gt   stdcin  gtgt something    Switch to read something   switchsomething      case a       cout ltlt You entered A, which is correct       break     case b       cout ltlt ...       break     codepre  pAnd thats my problem. Lets say I wanted to exit the WHILE loop, Itd require two break statementsp  pThis obviously looks wrongp  precodecase a   cout ltlt You entered A, which is correct   break   break codepre  pSo can I only do an IF statement on the a to use break Am I missing something really simplep  pThis would solve a lot of my problems that I have right now.p
