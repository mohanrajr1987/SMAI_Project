Negative 2348 pSo...p  pI teach formal methods in software engineering. I also teach agile methodologies. Most people seem to think this is contradictory. I think it makes a lot of sense... I also work for a company, where we need to actually get things done  While I can apply my earned skill points on specification in a daytoday basis, my colleagues typically flee away from the word formal. p  pI used to think that this was due to the intrinsic way we learn how to program we are usually driven to find a working solution, not to understand the problem. Then I thought this was due to the fact that most people in the formal community are not engineers, but mathematicians or computer scientists. Nowadays, I wonder if it just because the formalmethods community hide behind some kind of obfuscation law to use all the available UNICODE symbols, actively develop rude, unesthetic tools, and laugh in the face of standards.p  pYes, Ive been moving from a blame them to a blame us perspective p  pSo, my question is do you use any kind of formal methods in your company Have you introduced them, or were they prerequisites What techniques do you use to clear the fog of mathematics from peoples fears and incite them to use formal methods What do you think current tools are lacking for a more general usagep
