Positive 1702 pI am using codeboostasioconnectcode on a codetcpsocketcode.  When all goes fine, the codeconnectcode returns immediately but on a poor network, the codeconnectcode times out after a log wait of 15 seconds.  I cannot afford to wait that long and so want to reduce the timeout.  Unfortunately I have not come across any solution so far.  p  pI see solutions where asyncwait is been used together with deadlinetimer but all those examples are for receive  send operations and not for connect.  p  pCan anyone help me with a sample code for codeboostasioconnectsocket, endpointscode.  Requirement is that it should timeout in 5 seconds instead of 15. p

Negative 1702 pIm working on a python script but it uses a library called Selenium to perform most of its tasks. This script needs to be able to run in a windows environment and I cant go through the trouble of installing Selenium on every machine that I decide to run this script on. Ive heard of py2exe but havent tried it out and am not sure if it will help here. Will I be able to run my script without having to install selenium when using py2exe It doesnt seem like it would work since selenium isnt built into python.p  pId like to be able to run this script on Windows without having to install python but Ill be satisfied if I can get it to work without having to install selenium. Im not sure how possible this is and Im actually fairly new to developing in python so I dont know if this idea will work out.p  pActually, other people will be using this script and it would be best if they dont have to go through the trouble of installing python and the selenium library just to use the script. They arent exactly familiar with python or programming in general, so installing selenium could be a problem for them. Id like to make the use of my script as user friendly as possible.p  pThe script mainly deals with automating a website. I understand that this can be done in vbs and it would be better in vbs for windows but Ive already made it in python and dont want to go through the trouble of rewriting it in vbs, since Ive already spent a lot of time on this already.p  pIve tried many Google searches and cant find much about this topic which leads me to believe its not possible. The closest solution Ive found is py2exe but will it still work if my script uses a library not built into pythonseleniump  pIm sorry if this question was kind of nooby, Im just trying to learn.
