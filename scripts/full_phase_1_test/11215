Positive 11215 pI have a Windows 8.1 project targeting both Windows Phone 8.1 and Windows 8.1p  pApp resume and suspend event handlers are triggered correctly when debugging from visual studio and selecting lifecycle events. However, when I run the app natively on the Windows 8.1 device, the app suspend and resume events do not seem to be triggered.
