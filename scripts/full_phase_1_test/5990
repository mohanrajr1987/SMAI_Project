Positive 5990 pIm developing a tool which receives motion sensor data and sends it to a machine learning algorithm, which ultimately will deduce different types of movement. p  pI read the a hrefhttpdeveloper.android.comguidetopicssensorssensorsmotion.html relnofollowMotion sensor guidea and it seems like there is some redundancy in the data you can get from the sensors. For example the strongaccelrometerstrong data contains stronggravitystrong data and the stronglinear accelerationstrong data shows strongaccelerationstrong without acceleration due to stronggravitystrong. p  pSo my question is do i really need all the sensors to get all forms of motion or can I give up some of themp  pstrongEDITstrong clarifying the questionp  pI want to collect the minimal data that will allow me to deduce the same things. What Im looking for is user behavior the angle which the user holds his phone, the way the user moves while using his phone, etc..p  pThe answer Im looking for should include the sets of sensors that have high correlation within them, such that only some of the sensors in this set are required to deduce the same type of motionmovementrotationaccelerationetc..p

Positive 5990 pIll have a lot of XRay images of trucks moving through a XRay scanner at the speed 40 kmh. The goal is to remove the truck per se from a scan and leave only cargo so that operators could easier detect threats and forbidden items in cargo.p  pMy initial thought was to use neural networks to detect which truck among seen earlier is closest to one just being scanned. If the closest is still faraway, Id add this current one to seen before as a new. If not, subtract from the scan of the current truck the most similar truck so we get only cargo as a result. One problem is that its not clear yet how to remove cargo from a truck just added to the model. In addition, there are too many types of truck, so performance may be unsatisfactory.p  pWould ideas on how to solve this task would you suggest Or on what resource on the internet can I find helpp

Negative 5990 pI am building a nested comment reply system within my app.p  pEverything currently works as intended however I have found myself having to use several MySQL queries in order to retrieve the data required.  And even worse the query for the replies is within a foreach loop.  Meaning that although it performs admirably for now, it is far from optimal and will cause problems as the dataset grows.p  pTherefore I wish to solve this before I go any deeper into development.p  pSince the tables for the app share the same as the wordpress blog for the site I am using the wordpress shorthand for the queries.p  pThe current way the page is generated is as followsp  pA comments table is queried and all results relating to a projectid are retrievedp  precode    commentquery  select projectscomments., users.userurl, users.displayname                  from .wpdbgtprefix.projectscomments projectscomments                  left join .wpdbgtprefix.users users on users.IDprojectscomments.userid                 where projectid  projectid                 order by projectscomments.commentid desc                     comments  wpdbgtgetresultscommentquery codepre  pI then perform a foreach loop as belowp  precode   ifcomments              foreach  comments as c                                       replyquery  select projectreplies., users.userurl, users.displayname                   from .wpdbgtprefix.projectreplies projectreplies                  left join .wpdbgtprefix.users users on users.IDprojectreplies.uid                 where projectreplies.cid  cgtcommentid                  order by projectreplies.id desc                         limit 2                                                  replies  wpdbgtgetresultsreplyquery                  asortreplies                  countquery  select count                      from .wpdbgtprefix.projectreplies projectreplies                     where projectreplies.cid.cgtcommentid.                                       replycount  wpdbgtgetvarcountquery        generate html here      codepre  pInside this loop is two further queries.  The first gets the replies for each comment but limits the results to 2 I wish to do this in order to have a see all replies button which then queries the DB for the rest if the user requires them, the second query counts the total number of replies.p  pThe html is then also generated for each reply within the loop using a second nested foreach within the above loop where it says generate html code here as belowp  precodeif replies      foreach  replies as r         generate each reply       codepre  pAll data is pulled from these arrays in the following mannerp  precodecgtuserid, cgtbody etc... For the comments rgtuserid, rgtbody etc... For the replies. codepre  pI wish to keep this format if at all possible.p  pSo as stated at the beginning of the question, this all works perfectly however I am aware that by nesting the reply and count queries I am performing many more queries than necessary.  100 comments will generate 100 replies queries and 100 count replies queries etc.p  pThanks to some helpful people on this site I have considered using a join to get all the original data in one go for the comments and replies. Like so...p  precodecommentquery2  SELECT c.commentid, c.userid, c.body as cbody, c.projectid, c.posttime, cu.userurl AS cuurl, cu.displayname AS cuname,                     r., ru.userurl AS ruurl, ru.displayname AS runame                 FROM .wpdbgtprefix.projectscomments AS c                 LEFT JOIN .wpdbgtprefix.users        AS cu ON cu.ID  c.userid                 LEFT JOIN .wpdbgtprefix.projectreplies   AS r  ON r.cid  c.commentid                  LEFT JOIN .wpdbgtprefix.users        AS ru ON ru.ID  r.uid                 WHERE c.projectid  projectid                 ORDER BY c.commentid DESC, r.id DESC    codepre  pAlthough this does indeed work and was enough for me to mark that question as answered, when putting it into practice I have had several difficulties.p  pFirstly this retrieves all data as separate rows meaning that if I have 5 comments each with 3 replies, I actually get 15 rows returned and not a nested data object with the replies being nested within each comment row.p  pTo tackle this I have tried some array manipulation as shownp  precodeoldidNULL commentsarray  foreachgetcomments as c      ifcgtcommentid  oldid          comments[oldid]  c         oldid  cgtcommentid             comments[oldid][replies][]  c     codepre  pDoing this gives me a nested data object as required.  However it does not include the reply counting query and it does not limit each set of replies to 2 as intended, it retrieves all of them.p  pAnd finally with my current html generation code within the foreach loopsp  precodeforeachcomments      generate comment html      foreachreplies            generate replies html         codepre  pI cannot seem to get it to work correctly with the nested data object.  Accessing the correct deep replies seems to have me baffled.p  pSo to summarise, I wish to be able to remove the looped queries, combine them into one large and more efficient query or at worst in to a data query and a separate counting query, then create a neatly nested data object, with the comments as rows and any replies nested within under the heading repliesp  pThen I need to be able to iterate through these correctly within my php code in order to generate the required html.p  pI apologise for the length of this question and realise it may well put many of you off answering,  But I have been battling with this for 19 hours straight now and really need the help.p  pMany thanks to anyone who offers any suggestions.p

Negative 5990 pToday, Im building a little form generator for my firm.
