Positive 3326 pI will admit that this question is not phrased well, mostly because I dont know how to phrase it well. The thing is, I have been rather confused on how to position elements in my page, while using Bootstrap to keep the website responsive. p  pAs in, I find it difficult to use pixels because for some reason, I have this idea in my head that pixels are used with nonresponsive websites. So whenever I want to make something bigger, I am quite unsure how to do that, to not conflict with bootstrap.p  pShould I go deeper in Bootstrap or HTMLCSS to get over this thought problemp

Negative 3326 pI do have a problem with cancellation in floating point arithmetic. I know where the problem lies, but I cant think of an efficient solution.p  pHere is my problem I have a particle simulation in 3D, so each particle has 3 coordinates x, y, z. The whole domain is split into subcells. At one point I calculate the ID of the subcell in which  the particle is at a timestep. This is a simple formulap  precode   int cellOffsety  pos[1]  ymin  cellWidthy codepre  ppos[1] is the xcoordinate of the particle, ymin is the beginning of the domain and cellWidth the width of a cell. p  pHeres my problem I have a testcase in which case the coordinates of the particle should be 0. Due to floating point inaccuracy, it is approx. 3e18. When I use this formula, the 3e18 drops due to cancellation. The big problem here is now that, since the particle position is negative, and the border is exactly at 0, I get a different cellID returned than in which the particle is really in.p  pSo does anyone have an idea how to solve this problem I hope it is stated clearlyp
