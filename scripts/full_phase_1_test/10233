Positive 10233 pI wrote my own general use validation plugins which take a function to check if the input is valid and then a callback for each of the cases where the input is determined to be valid and invalid by the first function.p  pBasically, the plugin consists of two functions, .fn.validation to bind an object containing validation logic and successfailure callbacks to a element and then .fn.validate to either invoke the validation object, or if a new object is passed in it will use the new object for this one instance. Implementation of the plugins and a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.nethc0qc50r4 relnofollowa jsfiddle demonstrating the issuesa described below can be found here. p  pMy issue is that while text input and texareas seem to work really well in all cases, depending on how some elements, such as checkbox inputs, are selected, elements may not get validated despite being in the set of elements returned by the jQuery elementp  pFor example, the following selector will not result in check boxes being validatedp  precodeinput, textarea.validate codepre  pHowever a more specific selector will result in the checkboxes being validatedp  precodeinput[typecheckbox].validate codepre  pAgain, a hrefhttpsjsfiddle.nethc0qc50r4 relnofollowplease checkout the jsfiddlea where I have replicated the issuep

Negative 10233 pI am pretty new to Rails, and my biggest concerns yet is where to put my logic to maintain an object oriented design and at the same time adhere to the MVC pattern. So I guess this just as much a question about MVC as it is about Rails. This is my scenariop  pI have an import function in my Rails app that parses an uploaded Excelfile of orders and imports its content. When I wrote the function I put it in the OrdersController. I knew from the start it wasnt the best place to put it, but Im not exactly sure I want to put it in the model either. If I was to put it in the model, it would be as a class method, e.g. Orderimportfromexcel, and maybe that would be fine right now. But if the task would grow and become more complicated, it would probably need to be split into several methods and the model would be cluttered. I would in that case see it fit to move the whole import functionality into its own class, e.g. OrderImporter which would be perfectly normal in a none MVC, object oriented environment. But where would I put such a class, in lib p
