Negative 8 pWe know that it is not possible to cast a parent object to one of its child classes. p  pSo what is a good approach to solve the following problem Lets say Ive got a parent class Person and two child classes Customer and Employee. Note that the Person class is strongnotstrong abstract meaning it can be instanciated. Now I got the following method signaturep  precodepublic Person GetPersonByIdlong id codepre  pThis makes it possible to either return a Person, or one of its child classes. If I use this method, I can check via GetType whether if its a child or not. However, I can not easily access the fieldsmethods specific to the child class because I cant just cast it.  One approach would be to implement a constructor for each child class that takes the parent class as parameter and returns a new child classinstance. This has the drawback that I still would have a lot of duplicate code because I have to assign every parentfield in every child as well.p  pAnother approach I can think of would be to change the method to thisp  precodepublic object GetPersonByIdlong id codepre  pThat way, I could return any class. Id just check the type of the returned class and then cast it properly. But somehow, this approach seems dirty.p  pDoes anybody have a better way to do thisp

Negative 8 pIt probably looks like a simple question to you, but please help me to clarify my understanding of the whole workflow. One of Btrees advantages is that Btree is optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data a hrefhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBtree relnofollowhttpen.wikipedia.orgwikiBtreea. I wonder if the following is correctp  ol lipCase when Btrees nodes contain both keys and data as opposed to containing keys and pointers to data stored on disc. Then the whole Btree should be stored on disc, since large DB implemented by this tree does not fit in memory. Then it is clear why the reading large blocks makes difference when we are looking for a specific key, we retrieve a block with several suspicious keys with one disc access. OK, but what if a new key is inserted how can we be sure it gets in the same block as the other keys of the node Wiki suggests usage of partially full blocks to speed up insertions and deletions. Is it the only reasonable way pli lipCase when Btrees nodes contain keys and pointers to data stored on disc. Then the Btree and the data are separated. Btree can be stored on the disc, or in the memory. If it is stored on the disc, the situation is basically the same. If Btree is in the memory, then I do not see any advantages in reading large blocks of data. Am I missing something very simple, or such a scheme data on disc, index Btree in the memory is not used at all pli ol  pAnd yes, I did check SO, but still did not quite get it.p
