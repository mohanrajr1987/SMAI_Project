Positive 3626 pThe following UPDATE statement does exactly what I want it to dop  precodeUPDATE [dbo].[Person] SET [IsUpdated]  0  FROM [Person] p WHERE p.IsUpdated  1   and p.PersonID NOT IN SELECT DISTINCT q.PersonID FROM [DeletionQueue] d, [Queue] q                          WHERE d.fkQueueID  q.QueueID codepre  pHowever, when I run the Estimated execution plan for this statement, I see that 70 of my process time is consumed by the NOT IN SELECT statement. I would much rather achieve the same results using a JOIN statement of some sort.p  pI have tried to create the statement in a number of different ways, but the closest I have been able to come to replicating the above statement is one that gives me the exact opposite results of what I am looking for i.e. If I have 2 persons in the Persons table with IsUpdated  1, both persons have an entry in the Queue table QueueID, but only person B is in the DeletionQueue table fkQueueID, then only person As record in the Person table should have IsUpdated changed to 0. Currently, when I try a JOIN statement, person B is updated and person A is not.p  pI can use the statement as is if necessary, but performance is pretty critical in this application.  Any ideasp

Positive 3626 pIve been working on this for a long time. After solving the problem, it is still on my mind. p  pMy database has many relationships all many to one between tables. I will sketch a situation p  precodeusers  projects userid,  forms projectid,  formelements formid,  formelementlists formelementid,  codepre  pIf somebody updates a row of the formelementlists table I need to perform a check to make sure that the user is allowed to edit that specific row. My first thought would be to make 4 left joins. p  pBut because updating the rows happens very often I added a userid to every table, so a security check can be performed without any join query. Else I would sometimes even have to make 6 join to find the user id. p  pAfter some sleepless nights I want to propose this question to you is it better for performance and database design to make 6 joins, or to add an userid field to all the tables p
