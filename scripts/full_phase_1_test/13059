Positive 13059 pIm desperate Im trying to connect a file server and a databaseserver. First both were one, but now weve decided to seperate them due to high server requests.br   br  www.domain.ext  server Abr  files.domain.ext  server Bbr  br  At server A, we have our CMS which authenticates the user.br  br  At server B, we have a lot of directories with imagesdocuments inside, which can be retrieved like thisbr a hrefhttpfiles.domain.extuser relnofollowhttpfiles.domain.extuserausernamefilename.jpg.br  Now, we have to know at server B which user has been logged in at server A, to get the right username.br  br  At first weve tried to echo the session data in a specific file and to read that via cUrl. This seemed to be impossible, because we couldnt access the session which was set at server A and the result was always 401 Not authenticated. Even though the session domain was set to .domain.ext and CORSheaders were sent.br  br  Now, when a user is logging in at server A, we send a cUrl GETrequest to a file at server B with a combination of unique userdata. The file at server B receives the userdata and is going to authenticate for himself. If the userdata matches, a session is created at server B and everything should work fine.br p  pimg srchttpimagizer.imageshack.usv2640x480q90661NBaLaD.jpg altValid XHTML.p  pThe problem is that when I requests the file at server B with the userdata by browsing to the URL, Im getting logged in and everything works fine. But when I execute the cUrlrequest to the same URL, the session at server B stays empty.p  pMy goal is to include an iframe in the CMS at server A to show the files for a specific user from server B.

Its weird because it displays fine in a live setting. The only way to understand this is to have a look at this screenshot of my Dreamweaver workspace httpwww.crucean.comtestSiteimgbodyTextAnomaly.jpg.
