Negative 581 pLets say i have two classes A and B, which have theirs internal state represented by enum State. Class B extends A to add new functionality, but it also adds new internal state. To be precise, it adds finegrained state support, by dividing one of the As state into two new states.p  pI also need to use PropertyChangeSupport to monitor state changes. p  pCurrently I have all states defined in class A in enum State. I have protected methods setState and getState. To check on state from the outside, I wrote methods isAvaible, isComplete, etc. These methods are present only in appropriate class, depending on their hierarchy and state support.p  pI realy dont like the idea, having all states defined in parent class.
