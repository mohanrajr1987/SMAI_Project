Negative 17310 pIve been playing with Android for a little while now but I keep going back and forth with finding the best way to manage my data.p  pAt first I used a singleton which would hold the data I need to access across the app, like say, a selectedRestaurant item. The singleton would hold a reference to that variable which would make it accessible across all the activities. I quickly found out that singletons were a bad idea since they become null if the app is killed. I found out by leaving the app, doing some other stuff with the phone for a while and coming back to my app, only to get a null reference.p  pYou could put the object in the custom Application class, but that doesnt fix the problem that if the app is killed because its been in the background for too long, all your variables will be reinitialised when you get back to the app  AND the app will try to reopen the activity at the top of the stack, thats where you get errors referencing null objecsp  pAnother option would be to serialize the Restaurant object and pass it from activity to activity with the intent. But Ive read many time that serialization in Android is slow. Also, would that option be safe when the app or activity is killed for any reasonp  pThere are the SharedPreferences, which I use for simple values but obviously thats not usable for whole objects.p  pWhat Ive been doing is using a mix of variables sitting in the custom Application class, and a database  Ive been trying ActiveAndroid, which is fine for simple things but has limitations . Lets say I want to keep a reference to a Restaurant object selectedRestaurant In my Application class I have a private variablep  precodeprivate Restaurant mSelectedRestaurant codepre  pI then set up getters and setters. The trick is that in the getter I check if mSelectedRestaurant is null  it shouldnt be while youre using the app but if you leave and come back it might suddenly be, if its not I return it directly, if it is I fetch it from the database. In the setter I set the variable AND save it to the database.p  pThis seem to work well so far, except that I have some pretty big nested items that take a few seconds to save. p  pSo really I wanted to hear everyones thoughts on this and what is the best way to deal with this  bit of a long message... .

Negative 17310 pHow can I have genfromtxt to return me its list of column names which were automatically retrieved by namesTrue When I do p  precodedata  np.genfromtxttest.csv,namesTrue,delimiter,,dtypeNone print data[col1] codepre  pIt prints the entire column values for col1. But I need to traverse all column names how can I do that I tried data.keys and various other methods, but whatever is returned by genfromtxt does not seem to be a dictionary compatible object. I guess I could pass the list of column names myself, but this wont be maintainable for me in the long run.  p  pAny ideas p
