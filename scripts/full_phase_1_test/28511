Negative 28511 pFrom my understanding, this is a feature that at some point will be implemented. To store PHI, you must now have a BAA. The BAA with Google Apps allows a person to utilize user accounts but limits PHI to email, calendar, and drive.p  pGAE can be secured by locking its user access to a Google Apps account, if that Google Apps account has the BAA, thats a great start.p  pGoogle VMs can be locked down to networks and protocols, which adds quite a bit of security on that end. Would be great to setup an SFTP to exchange PHI on a VM. If CloudSQL wasnt an option, a person could run MySQL from the VM.p  pCloudSQL PHI data could be encrypted before storing to the database.p  pIt really seems like a very secure platform and easy to setup and maintain, but without the BAA for GAE, it doesnt do much good. Is there anyone at Google a person could contact about the possibility of signing a BAA as long as they followed safe practices Something for early adopters. If not, what does the current timeline look likep  pI know AWS is currently an option, but the capability of connecting Google App user accounts directly to GAE is such a great feature that I would much rather use GAE.p
