Negative 1011 pI created a WPF application that has an overlay mode. In this mode, the whole application gets semi transparent. Id now like to be able to click through this window to operate with elements behind it [other program UIs, desktop icons etc.]p  pI wonder if there is the possibility to configure the window right away to represent this behaviour. I set up my application window like thisp  precodeWindowStyleNone AllowsTransparencyTrue Opacity0.5 BackgroundBlack IsHitTestVisibleTrue FocusableTrue IsTabStopFalse codepre  pIf I set the Background to xNull or Transparent, I can click through the application. However, the application is not visible at all any more then.p  pIf this is not possible directly, I thought about another solution When clicking on the Application, minimize it, execute another mouse click, and then maximize the application. I found some example code for a global mouse click which looks like thisp  precodeMouseEventArgs e  new MouseEventArgsMouse.PrimaryDevice, 0 e.RoutedEvent  Mouse.MouseEnterEvent youUIElement.RaiseEvente  Or InputManager.Current.ProcessInpute codepre  pHowever, I think this will not work when trying to do doubleclicks.p  pSo, general desire in a few words Semitransparent WPF application, always on top, clickthrough. Also Keyboard input should pass through. I set up a special hotkey that brings the application back.p  pAny helps  ideasp
