Negative 355 pIn WPF, the codeRoutedUICommandcode is not a dependency object, nor does it implement codeINotifyPropertyChangedcode meaning if you were to bind its codeTextcode property to something in the UI such as a MenuItems header, and codeModecode wasnt codeOneTimecode, youd potentially get a memory leak with dynamically loaded context menus or UIs where items get created and destroyed very frequently as those UIs are loaded and unloaded.p  pConversely, if you do use codeOneTimecode, youll avoid the leak, but youll lose change notification which we need as our menus text needs to dynamically update as per status in the application. Think how a typical codeSave xxx As...code command changes to reflect the current items name.p  pThat said, how do we properly bind to text and get the changes without causing memory leaksp  pOur proposed solution is to create a subclass of codeRoutedCommandcode note no UI where we create our own codeTextcode property as well as implement codeINotifyPropertyChangedcode to support it.  However were not sure if there will be issues with WPFs builtin support for things like automatically binding a codeMenuItemcodes header to the codeTextcode property since it isnt a codeRoutedUICommandcode.  Note, we could just use a real codeRoutedUICommandcode object, then new over the codeTextcode property but there you can run into issues with how you access the property so wed rather avoid that if possible.p
