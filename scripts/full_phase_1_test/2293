Negative 2293 pI always used to use the following code to make a flip animation between one view and the otherp  precode        [UIView transitionFromViewfirstView                         toViewsecondView                       duration0.6                        optionsUIViewAnimationOptionTransitionFlipFromLeft                     completionBOOL finished                           finish code here                     ] codepre  pThis worked fine, giving a naturallooking flip. p  pBut when I used it on the view that was defined on a storyboard using emAuto Layoutem things started getting messy  the views were resized and moved after this animation. p  pIs there any way to emanimateem this kind of flip by animating constraints p
Negative 2293 pI am writing a program that opens two files for reading the first file contains 20 names which I store in an array of the form codeNames[0]  John0code. The second file is a large text file that contains many occurences of each of the 20 names. p  pI need my program to scan the entirity of the second file and each time it finds one of the names, a variable codeCountcode is incremented and so on the completion of the program, the total number of all the names appearing in the text is stored in codeCountcode.p  pHere is my loop which searches for and counts the number of name occurencesp  precodechar LineOfText[85] char TempName      whilefgetsLineOfText, sizeofLineOfText, fpn     fora  0 altNumOfNames a         TempName  strstrLineOfText, Names[a]         ifTempName  NULL             Count                codepre  pNo matter what I do, this loop doesnt work as I would expect it to, but I have discovered what is wrong I think. My problem is that each name in the array is NULL terminated, but when a name appears in the text file it is not NULL terminated, unless it occurs as the last word of a line. Therefore, this codewhilecode loop is only counting the number of times any of the names appear at the end of a line, rather than the number of appearances of any of the names anywhere in the text file. How can I adjust this loop to combat this problemp  pThank you for any advice in advance.p
Negative 2293 pI have a main activity and a ListFragment containing a custom ArrayAdapter that is a tab of that main activity. The main activity has an AsyncTask that pulls down an xml file then calls another class to parse it when the app starts. The ListFragment data comes from the parsed data that the AsyncTask.

Negative 2293 pIve just upgraded our project from Angular 1.2.25 to 1.3.6 and everything seems to have gone smoothly except our Protractor tests. This occurs in Protractor 1.3.1 and Protractor 1.5.0.p  pCalling codebrowser.getcode more than once in a test raises this error a hrefhttpsdocs.angularjs.orgerrorngbtstrpd relnofollowhttpsdocs.angularjs.orgerrorngbtstrpda. p  pWe are bootstrapping our application using codedatangappcode. p  pPassing aboutblank to codebrowser.driver.getcode between each call to codebrowser.getcode fixes this. This seems like an confusing solution though. p  pDoes anyone know what we might have done wrong to cause this issue or any insight towards a cleaner solution to this Thanksp
