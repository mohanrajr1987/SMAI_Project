Positive 136 pIf we are making a messenger program that requires a login and a password and client and a server, then, I assume, we actually need a security token, exactly in the same way you would on the web.p  pIn fact, if the client has a valid security token that it sends to the server to perform any action, then the fact that the token matched means that any action even delete my account is valid unless we have a really good hacker.

Positive 136 pI am planning an Android based application on my Magento store. I am using the SOAP API and the REST API without any problems, and I created some modules that use the classes in Mage.php.p  pEverything works fine, but now I have a strong doubt about the security of my application. To make my calls to the server with Magento, I check my credentials using the USER API and API KEY, these are included in my application, and are sent every time I make a request to my server to get my SessionId such as documentation. Since Android app are decompilabile easily, you do not think its a problem for the safety of my application contain the information of my API and API USER KEY, what do you recommend there is a way to make sure my App Thank youp
Positive 136 pWhile sniffing the Firebase traffic, I have seen that a code is passed to the auth server so that it always returns a 200 status code.

Positive 136 pHi Im writing a game with codenode.jscode, codesocket.iocode, and codecanvascode and was wondering how to validate packets properly. Im under the impression that users can use a packet injection program to send packets that the server isnt expecting. For example,p  ul liSend a packet with one of the parameters outside of normal bounds x or y beyond game spaceli liSend extremely large packets to overwhelm the serverli liSend a packet with additional parameters the server is not expectingli liSend a packet with data that, when read, may execute commands on the server escape charactersli liSend the same packet over and over to overwhelm the server DoSli ul  pWhat are the typical measures taken to prevent such things Are some of the bullets not an actually issue Am I missing anything Are there any libraries to assist in any of thisp
Negative 136 pI know Silverlight 4 added support for RTL languages through the FlowDirection property.  p  pBeing new to RTL I just want to make sure I understand what should happen when I set the FlowDirection property.  I noticed that the text alignment for the TextBoxes are now right aligned and the whole UI basically mirrors itself by switching everything that was on the left over to the right.  So this all seems to be working fine.  However, when entering text in a Textbox, surely the text should complete from right to left now as well.  So I if enter the word run in a TextBox with FlowDirection set to RTL, then surely it should read nur and not run  Is my understanding correct, but currently the TextBox still displays it as run even thought it is rightaligned in the control itself.p

I cant seem to locate the source for XmlDiffPatch.View, outside of the XmlDiff and the XmlDiffPatch.View samples.  The current XmlDiffPatch.View class only offers GetHtml, which is fine if you want to use their output style, but wont work with what I need to do.  Ideally Id like to add a method that would just return the XML of the differences, with some indication of what was added, changed, or deleted.  Then using some XSLT I can view it any way I want or do other stuff with it.p  pSo, the question is answered  this definitely works for what I asked, but Im wondering if anyone has seen the source out therep

Releasing the shift button, 9s or 0s are inserted again.p  pAlso, this issue happens when I release the shift button before the number 9 while trying to insert . Same with 0 and . If I release 9 or 0 first, this issue doesnt occur.p
