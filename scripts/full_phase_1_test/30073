Positive 30073 pA bit new to Mongo here.  I want to return a subset of a collection using find, but from a specified starting point.  I have a dictionarylike list of documents that I return in chunks and in alphabetical order via the codesortcode and codelimitcode parameters, but it always starts at the beginning of the collection.  p  pI want to be able to add a starts with parameter to the find method so that, for example, if I queried the letter h it would return all documents but with the first one returned being the first document starting with h.  Using next would eventually return documents starting with i, j, k, and so on.  I also havent been able to find any uses or hacks to allow for a previous method that does the opposite of next.  Id like to use previous or whatever it may be called, to return documents starting with g, f, all the way back to the beginning of the collection. p  pAm I barking up the right tree  This seems like a pretty obvious function of a database, but I havent found any examples or other mention of using Mongo like this.p
