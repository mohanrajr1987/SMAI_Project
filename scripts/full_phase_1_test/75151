Positive 75151 pOk, so I thought I understood this, but it seems I dont have complete understanding of it.p  pIve just created an app on my local machine. I had a local code.envcode file storing my local environment variables. I understand that when you commit the app to the server with git, the code.envcode file isnt pushed, and that you should set the environment values on the server.p  pWell, Im using DigitalOcean, and I have created a new virtual host file, and set the environment variables in there using the codeSetEnv APPENV localcode syntax.p  pWhen I access the site through the browser, I know its picking up the env values because I get an error message saying that the base table isnt found, and the database name is what is set in my environment variables. This is fine, because I havent run migrations yet.p  pHowever, When I ssh into the server, and run codephp artisan migratecode, it appears to not be picking up the Env values. I assume this is because artisan is not running through an apache virtual host.p  pDoes this mean I need to create a code.envcode file which will store my database details etc If so, whats the point in setting the environment variables in the virtual host file, and not just have a single code.envcode file By setting values in the Virtual Host config file, and also a code.envcode file, Im duplicating environment variables, which is surely bad practicep  pIf I shouldnt create another code.envcode file for the server, how do I specify the environment values to use within artisanp  pI hope I explained the question well enough, but if I havent, or I need to clear something up, please ask.p
