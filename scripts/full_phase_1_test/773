Positive 773 h1Problemh1  pI have a static SPA site built with Angular and hosted on Amazon S3. Im trying to make my prerendered pages accessible by crawlers, but I cant redirect the crawlers requests since Amazon S3 does not offer a URL Rewrite option and the Redirect rules are limited.p  h1What I haveh1  pIve added the following metatag to the codeltheadgtcode of my strongindex.htmlstrong pagep  pre classlanghtml prettyprintoverridecodeltmeta namefragment contentgt codepre  pAlso, my SPA is using pretty URLs without the hash codecode sign with HTML5 push state. p  pWith this setup, when a crawler finds my codehttpmywebsite.comaboutcode link, it will make a codeGETcode request to codehttpmywebsite.comaboutescapedfragmentcode. This is a a hrefhttpsdevelopers.google.comwebmastersajaxcrawlingdocsspecificationhlen relnofollowpattern defined by Googlea and followed by others crawlers.p  pWhat I need is to answer this request with a prerendered version of the strongabout.htmlstrong file. Ive already done this prerendering with Phantom.js, but I cant serve the correct file to crawlers because Amazon S3 do not have a rewrite rule.p  pIn a strongnginxstrong server, the solution would be to add a rewrite rule likep  precodelocation     if args  escapedfragment       rewrite . snapshots1.html break        codepre  pBut in Amazon S3, Im limited by their a hrefhttpdocs.aws.amazon.comAmazonS3latestdevHowDoIWebsiteConfiguration.htmlconfigurebucketaswebsiteroutingrulesyntax relnofollowredirect rulesa based on KeyPrefixes and HttpErrorCodes. The codeescapedfragmentcode is not  a KeyPrefix, since it appears at the end of the URL, and it gives no HTTP error since Angular will ignore it.p  h1What Ive triedh1  pIve started trying using dynamic templates with ngRoute, but later Ive realized that I cant solve this with any Angular solution since Im targeting crawlers that cant execute JavaScript.p  pWith Amazon S3, I have to stick with their redirect rules.p  pIve managed to get it working with an ugly workaround. If I create a new rule for each page, Im donep  pre classlangxml prettyprintoverridecodeltRoutingRulesgt    lt each page needs it own rule gt   ltRoutingRulegt     ltConditiongt       ltKeyPrefixEqualsgtaboutescapedfragmentltKeyPrefixEqualsgt     ltConditiongt     ltRedirectgt       ltHostNamegtmywebsite.comltHostNamegt       ltReplaceKeyPrefixWithgtsnapshotsabout.htmlltReplaceKeyPrefixWithgt     ltRedirectgt   ltRoutingRulegt  ltRoutingRulesgt codepre  pAs you can see in this solution, each page will need its own rule. Since Amazon limits to only 50 redirect rules, this is not a viable solution.p  pAnother solution would be to forget about pretty URLs and use hashbangs. With this, my link would be codehttpmywebsite.comaboutcode and crawlers would request this with codehttpmywebsite.comescapedfragmentaboutcode. Since the URL will start with codeescapedfragmentcode, it can be captured with the KeyPrefix and just one redirect rule would be enough. However, I dont want to use ugly URLs.p  pstrongSo, how can I have a static SPA in Amazon S3 and be SEOfriendlystrongp
