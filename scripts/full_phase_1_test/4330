It doesnt matter which row gets copied and inserted above as long as it is a duplicate of any of those. So for example in column G 24503 it would copy row 16, insert a new row and copy the contents of row 16 above row 16. It would do that for each new set of SKUs in column G. I do not need each line duplicated just one new line for each set. Hope that makes sense. If I can get that I have a way to paste in the parent skus already I just need that line in each section copied and inserted not a blank line though and it needs to be the whole row across.p

Negative 4330 pHello all here is my problem. My apps listview which is inside a tab widget contains various types of rows. I have had many problems setting this up and here is another 1. Please see a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions9467421edittextsettextchangesmysoftkeyboardinputtypeinacustomadapterherea for the code, which basically remains the same. I use another activity a custom implemented ES file explorer which is a filebrowser dialog to open a file. The data from the file is sent to the listview. When it shows the list and I click on the spinner the screen darkens and freezes. If I press the back button the darkening disappears, the listview becomes clickable but the spinner still is not. The only way out is if I flip to another tab widget and back again there are 2 separate ones the spinner will work again.p  pI should say that the spinner works just fine if I do not load files from the other activity.  So I guess in other words there is a problem of focus or something when switching and killing activities.p  pI hope you can help. p  pEDIT after some more trying, sometimes after loading the file from the browser it will return to a black screen where the listview is there but not visible. eg you can click on it and the editor opens.p

Negative 4330 pI was reading a great article a hrefhttpwww.mikesdotnetting.comArticle125ASP.NETMVCUploadingandDownloadingFiles relnofollowherea that covers the ins and outs of using ASP MVC for uploadingdownloading files. Ill try to keep this short here goes.p  pMy MVC3 app will be running in one place houston and its mission will be to allow our employees, all over the world 30 domain controllers to download various software packages via our Intranet. Today, each of these 30 sites has a replicated Programs folder mapped to a shared drive. So, someone in China isnt dowloading an app to install from here in Houston. Theyll get if off their logonserver in China. I am able to interrogate the logonserver environment variable to determine the server they are on...but short of dynamically building a hyperlink with the UNC embedded this works by the way...I cant really use any of the streaming methods specific to MVC because it will end up getting pulled into the box where my web app is running houston to be streamed back across some pond. Is my thinking right on this I prefer to stream because this way I can lock down that Programs folder and only grant the ASP Process the authority to access the replicated folder.p
Negative 4330 pIm building a new Silverlight app for a photography studio. I was about to say you have to have a Windowsbased server hosting it and then I thought, wait is that right Looks like its not. So I could point him toward a Linux host. p  pI know you have to register the MIME types from a different SO thread. Are there any other caveats or gotchas that I need to know about Assume for a second that I know next to nothing about Linux. p  pEdit what if the app needs to talk to a database mySQL Seems like Id need to have Moonlight to get that going, which isnt gonna fly. p

Negative 4330 pI have read a paper which proposes an approach to capture network traffic from a specific android application.It says We used tcpdump to collect all the network traffic from the virtual machine. We ported the strace utility to Android to log each networking system call performed by the app.We identified all the threads started by the app using the process id pid of the app. Based on this thread information,we can filter out the traffic that does not origin from the app. But I still could not know the operational principle.So how can I capture network traffic from a specific android applicationThanks for answering.p
