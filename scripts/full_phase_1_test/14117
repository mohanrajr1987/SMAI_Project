Positive 14117 pThrough much trial and error mostly error, I have managed to incorporate jQuery Validate, Bootstrap 3 using Popovers for validation messages, and DataTables to create I suspect a fairly common scenariop  pA DataTable that contains a column of checkboxes, and offer a check all checkbox that selects all the checkboxes across pagination and filtering in a DataTable, and apply jQuery Validate to ensure a user doesnt submit without choosing at least one checkbox.p  pHeres a link to a live example of what Im doing a hrefhttplive.datatables.netlomelono2 relnofollowhttplive.datatables.netlomelono2ap  pIt works the script picks up all the checked checkboxes either via the check all checkbox, or if manually chosen, and across pagination and filtering on the DataTable, and will validate if no checkbox is chosen.p  pWhat it doesnt do isp  ul liClear the validation error if the check all checkbox is chosenli ul  pAnother odd side effect by using code.appendTocode to ensure all checked checkboxes across paginationfiltering are chosen for submit is all the checkboxes checked or unchecked will appear at the bottom of the form before submit the submit is disabled on the example so you can see the behavior.p  pObviously I know just enough jQuery to be dangerous, but is there a better way to submit all the checked checkboxes, AND ensure clientside validation works correctly Of course, I have a serverside catch, but ideally we want to inform the user BEFORE they submit.p  pI think I am really close to solving this, and hopefully someone can point me towards the finish line, that will hopefully benefit others who have this kind or similar sort of scenario.p
