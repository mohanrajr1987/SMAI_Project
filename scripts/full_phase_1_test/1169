The code in my DispatcherServlet looks like thisp  blockquote   pRequestDispatcher dispatcher  getServletContext.getNamedDispatcherMyServlet   dispatcher.forwardrequest, responsep blockquote  pThis works perfectly. But, I would like to use the new Servlet 3 annotations without the web.xml, hence I do thisp  precodeWebServletnameMyServlet public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet      ... codepre  pBut now, codegetServletContext.getNamedDispatcherMyServletcode within my DispatcherServlet returns strongnullstrong instead of the appropriate dispatcher for codeMyServletcode, although I expect that codeWebServletnameMyServletcode behaves the same like codeltservletnamegtMyServletltservletnamegtcodep  pI have tested this on Tomcat 7.  Is this because MyServlet has not been loaded yet by the time when DispatcherServlet is called and hence the name of MyServlet is not known If so, what sense does the codeWebServletname...code annotation make p  pPlease dont answer with something like why dont you use filters etc. This is more about the background of annotations vs. web.xmlp  pThanks in advancep  pps. please change the title if you find a more suitable one p
