Positive 3054 pWhat follows is a series of conclusions Ive drawn from the currently available knowledge on the topic, and the question is essentially whether this is correct and if not, what is the appropriate correction to these conclusions.p  pAs an experienced .net developer, I am totally formed into the idea that all object instances exist almost as particles in a cloud, and object membership simply interrelates those particles. When a particle or particle cloud cannot be linked by some reference back to the root object in the framework, it or its members are disposed of. This essentially the result of reference counting and some kind of network analysis maintaining an understanding of whether an object still has a path to the root.p  pIn this structure, an identifiable instance of an object can be referenced owned by many other objects and the network of ownership can be as complex and circularselfreferential as necessary.p  pIt appears in transitioning to C that this freedom must be constrained for the benefit of memory management. All objects must have a clear tree of ownership, with object lifetime maintained by its parent.p  pLifetime may also be constrained by scope as for temporary values within braced code sections . Lifetime can also, though it is absolutely to be avoided, by using the codenewcode keyword and careful use of codedeletecodep  pIn newer standardisations of C that things like sharedptr appear to be designed to allow something closer to the .net managed memory model. I do not know if these also offer the same benefit of the managed memory of discarding selfreferential but otherwise unconnected object clouds.p  pAn example is the stdlist. So far as I can tell, the recommended strategy is that an object instance in the list must be, without the benefit of the sharedptr constructs, owned solely by the list and have its lifetime dictated by the lists own lifetime. This leads to the need for copy constructors, destructors called on temporaries, or the use of the emplace methods that require the list have a single concrete type. Alternative solutions involve storing pointers to objects and managing object lifetime elsewhere, though this is fraught with obvious dangers. All this seems quite awkward.p  pIn .net a list can reference an object without having to be its parent or guardian because the objects lifetime is otherwise managed.p  pI know there are distinctions between heap and stack memory that have implications on performance, however I am not intimately knowledgeable on the topic.p  pIs my view of the two systems essentially correct If not, what corrections can be offered If it is essentially correct, what literature exists that describes the mental model of C I need to adopt to create large, powerful and highperformance applications That includes bestpractices for the code as well as the more abstract concept of managing a large application robustly.p
Positive 3054 pHopefully this is a newbie question.p  pSo if I have kind of a long set of selects in my SQL and a couple of subselects within my where clause, Im less than satisfied with the formatting in the view designer, which appears to be the only way to displayshow my views after they are saved.p  pSo, in short, is there any way to directly edit my views within SSMS, and have the views retain the formatting in my codep  pi.e. p  precodeselect case comment    when a  5      then b  2     else b  4   why b 4    end as field1,   dt as field2,... codepre  pgets all mashed upp  precodeselect case comment      when a  5                   then b  2                 else b  4   why b 4                end as field1,              dt as field2,... codepre  pOr something along those lines.p
Positive 3054 pI have some Javascript that is processing a form to send the results to the server through Ajax, and I want to reuse from code to process common components of certain question types. Lets say I have two question types Forced Choice and Forced Choice with Other, both of which use radio buttons to force the user to choose one option, but in the second type, a radio button labeled other will allow them to input their own answer into a question box. Getting the radio button value will be common between the two but getting the other value will not. Would it be acceptable to sayp  precodeswitchquestionType      case Forced Choice     case Forced Choice with Other         code to get radio button value     case Forced Choice with Other         if value was other, get the value of the textbox         break     default         break  codepre  por would it be preferable to say p  precodeswitchquestionType      case Forced Choice     case Forced Choice with Other         code to get radio button value         ifval  other ampamp questionType  Forced Choice with Other             code to get other value         break     default         break  codepre  pEdit I just wanted to add some clarification that in my actual code, the question type distinction is not as simple as with or without allowing other. Id like to use the same code to get the value of all radiobutton based questions, and there are several types. For some, it would be as simple as getting the values, but for others, my script would have to check how to script is configured in the forms JSON configuration file. Id like to use the first pattern to avoid a chunk of several if statements that all have 23 conditions.p  pWhich pattern do you think is preferable and why if the first pattern would even function correctlyp
Positive 3054 pLets say I have a super simple user registration check that a users email must be unique across all users.p  pIve expressed this requirement in such functions.p  precodedefn validateuser [user]   and email user isunique email user  defn isunique [email]   not dbapiuserexists email email codepre  pBut I want to decouple my validation from the database, I want to make it purely functional. I could probably also inject the database API as a parameter to codevalidateusercode, likep  precodedefn validateuser [dbapi user]   and email user isunique dbapi email user  defn isunique [dbapi email]   not userexists dbapi email email codepre  pbut I dont know if this is idiomatic.p  pAlso, it feels like the consumer of codevalidateusercode should not care about the database api. It feels like having this dependency undermines the entire concept of separating the business logic layer from the persistence layer. So Im looking for a mindset that explains how to do this properly, or why it could not be done.p
Positive 3054 pId like to create a ToDo app in AngularJS that uses nested ToDos.  As part of this, Id like the ability to indent or outdent a ToDo with a click ultimately, it will react to a tab or shifttab keypress.  When indenting, the function should also indent any child ToDos.  This is where Im having trouble. Im not sure how to implement a recursive function in a directive.
