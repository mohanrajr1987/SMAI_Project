Positive 10193 pwe run an codersynccode on a large folder. This has close to a million files inside it including html, jsp, gifjpg, etc. We only need to of course incrementally update files.

Positive 10193 pGot an interesting problem. Im pulling a query on a registry to see if it exists  if it does, I go down one path. If it doesnt, I go down a seperate path. Ill put a code example at the bottom. Heres the questionp  pFIND doesnt have an L switch I can use for literal interpretation. One of my settings is 4, and the other is 14. So 14 works great, 4 finds both 4 and 14.p  pIs there a way to have it find 4 rather than just 4 Using escape characters before the quotations or double quoting just makes it miss entirely.p  pThis is just an example of what I mean. Names and values changed to protect the innocent. This is part of a much larger script, so enabledelayedexpansion is necessary.p  precodesetlocal enabledelayedexpansion set ValueOne4 set ValueTwo14      rem This section determines if additional specific concept settings are needed. ConceptCheck rem DEBUG echo CONCEPT CHECK  for f tokens1 G in reg query hklmsoftwareSomeRegistry v Value  find ValueTwo do  echo Value Two Found call ValueTwoSetup  for f tokens1 G in reg query hklmsoftwareSomeRegistry v Value  find ValueOne do  echo Value One Found call ValueOneSetup  goto eof codepre  pWhen run, if the entry is ValueTwo, it works great. ValueOne calls both ValueTwo and itself, due to the fact that 14 has the number 4 in it, and find catches it. Ive tried ValueOne, but then it fails utterly. Ive tried ValueOne to the same result. I CAN stick an goto eof at the end of the do call, but then I lose expandability, and I still have to monitor which value shows up first, which makes things more complicated and clumsy. Ill be dealing with around two hundred values by the time Im done, and they arent sequential.p  pThoughtsp
