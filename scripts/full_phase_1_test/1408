Positive 1408 pI dont understand why it behaviors so. Expression is something fairly new to me especially when using in LinqToEntity. Here is my codep  precodevar getInt  GetType.GetMethodgetAnInt, BindingFlags.Static                                                BindingFlags.NonPublic var p  Expression.ParametertypeofStudent             var id  Expression.Propertyp, ID       var eq  Expression.EqualExpression.Convertid, typeofint, getInt,                            Expression.Constant2 var pred  Expression.LambdaltFuncltStudent, boolgtgteq, p use the pred in query foreachvar student in myContext.Students.Wherepred     this always print ID 2 which equals to the constant above     no matter what is returned by the getAnInt method     System.Diagnostics.Debug.Printstudent.ID  the getAnInt method  static int getAnIntstring dummy    return 100  codepre  pIn fact Im just experimenting not an actual issue in job. The codeIDcode field in database table is varchar having format of integer convertible to int. Im trying to convert the id into int but not using the int.Parse static method because Im experimenting with another method before comparing to an int constant. At first my codegetAnIntcode returned codeint.Parsedummycode and worked OK but  then I tried changing it to make it return an arbitrary integer. The result is  so surprising that no matter what integer it returns, the codeidcode seems to be converted to codeintcode OK as if it was converted by codeint.Parsecode and compared with codeExpression.Constant2code, which always filters for the student having id of code2code.p  pI expected the converted value of id should be the return value of codegetAnIntcode but it seems to be bypassed.  Ive also tried making another snippet of code to test the codeExpression.Convertcode and this shows that it works OKp  precodevar t  typeofForm1.GetMethodTest, System.Reflection.BindingFlags.Static  System.Reflection.BindingFlags.NonPublic var p  Expression.Parametertypeofstring var c  Expression.Convertp, typeofint, t var e  Expression.Equalc, Expression.Constant10 var f  Expression.LambdaltFuncltstring,boolgtgte, p var k  f.Compile1 test the value of k to see if it works.                           the parameter will be bypassed                           the return value of Test is obtained                            and compared against constant 10 as expected.  static int Teststring dummy    return 10 this makes the k above return true               any other value makes it return false               It seems to work OK here.  codepre  pThe only difference here is the first code is tested in context of LinqToEntity while the second just tries executing the compiled expression directly.  Im sure my codeStudentscode entities have all interested values of codeidcode for my test. As you see its just an entity set, simple enough. I dont know how to debug when it comes to Expression. The second test was what Ive tried to confirm if I understand codeExpression.Convertcode correctly.p  pI hope you could find something wrong in my first code or at least give me any directionsuggestion on what could be wrong. Thank you very much for your help.p
