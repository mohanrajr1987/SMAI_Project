Positive 607 pThanks for taking time to read my question.p  pHaving migrated to a new CMS based website, the url structure was significantly different.p  p Original Url Structure p  precodehttpwebsite.comproductsProductName.html httpwebsite.comcategoriesThisampThat httpwebsite.compagesCONTACTTHETEAM.html codepre  p New Url Structure p  precode httpwebsite.comproductname  httpwebsite.comsomecategory  httpwebsite.comcontacttheteam codepre  pI spent a lot of time learning about .htaccess, reading through stack exchange and other blogs.

Make all urls lowercase RewriteRule index.phpadmin  [L] RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME f RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME d RewriteCond REQUESTFILENAME s RewriteCond REQUESTURI [AZ] RewriteRule  lcREQUESTURI [NC,R301,L]  4. 301 page.html to page RedirectMatch 301 ..html httpwebsite.com1 codepre  pPoint number 2. Remove ampersand from url was worked out with the help of user axiac a hrefhttpstackoverflow.comquestions30519712htaccessstripcharacters26fromurlanswertabactivetabtop.htaccess  Strip characters 392639 from urlap  pThe above .htaccess code works, but the redirect code 3.Make all urls lowercase critically effects forms on the site. It seems that these form post are blank.p  pI also had some issues in the admin area, with loss of function. The below line declaring the admin area to be ignored fixed this issue.     RewriteRule index.phpadmin  [L]p  pTrailing from this line of thought I tried many variations such as below     RewriteRule ..html lcREQUESTURI [NC,R301,L]  This fixed the issue, but the .html only rule means that capitals in the urls for the categories are ignorednot included. p  pMy thoughts are the best method of firing the redirect would be via RedirectMatch 301 rather than a blanket rule. Unfortunately after hours of testing and googling I am unable move forward on this.p  pAny advice on where to look on how to achieve this would be really appreciated.p  pThank you.p
