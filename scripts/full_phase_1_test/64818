How do I make a fullscreen game, without stretching or compromising resolution, preferably without black bars on the sides andor top and bottom of the screen 1280x960 is also fine for my purposes, and is compatible with most monitors, but libGDX automatically stretches it to a funky resolution. How do I fix thatp
